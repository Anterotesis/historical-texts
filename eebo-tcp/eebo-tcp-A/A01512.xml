            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

My hopes are that you (out of your gratious and accustomed blindnesse) will not so much, as deigne to looke vpon their diseases, but passe them ouer with the hand of Fauour, as you haue often done other sicke creatures of their sanguine complexion.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He manifest vanitie, euident folly, and expresse madnes of some mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable and vnhappie men, who with a mind puffed vp with pride, a noddle lighter than an oake ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and more voide of wit, than cockles of meate in the waine of the moone, presume notwithstanding extremely vpon themselues, in that they are of this friendly and pleasant sort of Buffones; (for according to the saying of the Philosopher, where little wit is, thither doe men runne with greatest fauour and liking) being lifted vp to such an height, that like to that memorable gourd in <hi>Ariosto,</hi> in short space of time they must needs fall: is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pallest cause that I being amazed and astonished at this their so great folly, after my Theater of sundrie humors and inclinations, haue taken vpon me to build this most famous Hospitall, where the renowmed folly of these men may be seene and discerned, written (as it were) in Text letters, and in chambers or lodgings apart, painted and set foorth by me with so beautifull and workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like prospectiue, that other Fooles shall flocke about them; and as the Kings of Fooles, they shall receiue an open-mouthed applause of them all, to the ende, that while the pipkin boyleth, the smoak that pleaseth them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues so much, may forcibly come steaming out at the crowne of their owne hats. Yet is this no reason, but that the generall Folly of the world, spurreth me for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to doe the same, besides the kindes of particular
<pb facs="tcp:3057:5"/>
Follies, the which procure me that (all humaine kinde participating of the same) I build for each one of them distinct Cels, wherein they may all commodiously, and with great ease repose themselues. And in this point, it will appeare how godly a man the Author of this frame was; who besides the building, made at the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of so many weake and poore in braine, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent inuention hath deuised to recommend them all to some God; vnder whose protection they might bee kept, or as far as is possible, defended, and helped of their folly. So he will specially beseech <hi>Minerua,</hi> to take care of franticke and delirant Fooles; <hi>Iupiter Hospitalis,</hi> of melancholike and sauage; <hi>Apollo,</hi> of ydle and carelesse; God <hi>Abstemius,</hi> of those drunken; <hi>Cameronte,</hi> of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfull and fickle headed; God <hi>Sentinus,</hi> of stupide, lost, and halfe dead Fooles; the Egyptian Oxe of those not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, grosse, and loblolly-lams; the Samian sheepe, of shallow-pates and ninnie hammers; the Goddesse <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bona,</hi> of lumpish and loggerheaded; the God <hi>Fatuellus,</hi> of plaine Fooles and naturals; the Goddesse <hi>Themis,</hi> of those vitious; <hi>Nemesis,</hi> of the malitious and despitefull; God <hi>Risus,</hi> of the ridiculous; <hi>Iuno,</hi> of the vaine-glorious; <hi>Mercurie,</hi> of dissembling and counterfeit; <hi>Hecate,</hi> of lunaticall or Fooles by season; <hi>Cupid,</hi> of louing Fooles; Goddesse <hi>Venilia,</hi> of desperate; <hi>Vulcanus,</hi> of heteroclite, light-brained, and addle-headed; <hi>Fabulanus,</hi> of scoffing Fooles; <hi>Bacchus,</hi> of those pleasant, sweete, sociable, and louing; <hi>Tesiphon,</hi> of those angrie and froward; <hi>Mars,</hi> of the furious, brutish, or bedlemsort; <hi>Hercules,</hi> of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trauagant, extreme, and wilfull Fooles; <hi>Rhadamanthus,</hi> of the pild-pated; <hi>Volutina,</hi> of monstrous &amp; three-elbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed Fooles; <hi>Hippona,</hi> of them vntamed like an horse; Inexorable <hi>Minos,</hi> of them obstinate like a mule; and
<pb facs="tcp:3057:5"/>
finally, infernall <hi>Pluto,</hi> of mischieuous or diabolicall Fooles. In the meane while I coniure the housholde Gods, that they will haue a care of this family of general Fooles; and the Gods Tutelar, that they will vndertake the tuition and protection of this new Hospitall. God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse <hi>Ops,</hi> that with conuenient remedies, shee will suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour so many infirme, and naked of wit and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; Goddesse <hi>Medetrina,</hi> that she will cure them well; God <hi>Aesculapius,</hi> that with miraculous Hellebore, he will purge them after some sort; Goddesse <hi>Sospita,</hi> that she will heale them out of hand; God <hi>Ianus,</hi> that hee will permit euerie one to enter within the gates of this Hospitall, that they may behold the miserie of these vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie and infortunate: and that especially which is performed on the festiuall day of all Fooles, as the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines were accustomed, the Author desireth, that the gates may be set broad open, where they may see the <hi>Bacchanals</hi> of the <hi>Menades,</hi> a matter pleasant aboue all <note place="margin">Or Bacchus Nunnes.</note> others, and rare to behold. With this inuention there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it hath pleased him to rebate the edge, and rashnes of those moderne Thersites, who thinke themselues A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iaces; of those Pigmeis that esteeme themselues <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des;</hi> of those peeuish Fooles that iudge themselues <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors;</hi> of those field-Crickets that play the parrats so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably; of those pearched Cuckoes that laugh at all the world; of those skinlesse Snailes that lift vp their hornes for nothing; of those Horse-flies of <hi>Pigneta,</hi> that are bread in dung and durt; of those <hi>Lobbellinoes,</hi> properly leaden-heeled, but light-headed as a straw: for pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing through this Hospitall, they shall see that Folly was their mother, Buffonerie their sister, Ninnerie their companion for terme of life, and that betweene them and Folly there is a iust Logicall equipollence, Phisicall

These be those that first put it into the Authors head to frame this new building, where the honourable beholders shall haue great solace and pastime, to see the foolish Prosopopaeia of these sauage geese, and will take no small delight and pleasure at the strange and vnusuall follies, which within shall discouer themselues in these men, who counterfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting other <hi>Catoes</hi> among the multitude, will in the ende appeere to be nothing, but kings of Crickets, Doctor doddipowles, grout-headed Gratians, or cockscombe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like <note place="margin">Gratian in their Comedies is the name of an ignorant Doctor or Pedant.</note> Merlins, as in truth they are.

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T being but a Poeticall fiction, that this whole world was in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning framed of <hi>Chaos,</hi> vpon better aduise and reason one may change opinion, or at least haue his owne cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure by himselfe: it seeming vnto mee a more probable thing, that from the beginning of Forme, which the philosophers hold to be perfection, this world groweth daily to <hi>Chaos</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion. But if the materiall frame be any waies answerable to him, who is the epitomethereof (man being termed <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crocosmos)</hi> I am sure this assertion may well be maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For Nature (diuine ministresse) contending in the creation of all things, to imprint in them the seale and forme of Diuinitie, shee findeth no enemie nor obstacle to this her perfect worke but matter, which still encreaseth according to the augmentation, and growth of things created. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon commeth the great difference betweene the superiour immortall, and the inferiour corruptible parts of man, the faculties of the soule and minde, being choaked in all her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine intentions, by the grosse humours and temperature of the bodie, wherein as in a darke and loathsome prison, it is while the gayle deliuerie of death inclosed. And from hence in like manner doth it arise, that this wittie, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie Author, obserueth in the tree of humaine conceit and vnderstanding, so many grafts of follie and fopperie inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as that no man how mightie or profound soeuer he be in his owne sight, is exempted from some measure or proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of these dottrell drammes. In religion (which is the
<pb facs="tcp:3057:7"/>
highest action amongst men) is it not a woonderfull thing to see the obstinate opposition of some more fantasticke, then truely zealous: one iudging euerie decent formalitie, deepe and dangerous superstition; another abandoning all true ground and substance, for naked traditionall rite and forme. Next vnto this in the second cure of our bodies, how infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite are the follies of Phisitions in the practise of their Art, into whose hands notwithstanding at one time or other are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted the liues of almen, wading through such a number of incertainties before they attaine to one sound <hi>probatum,</hi> and making their trials &amp; experiments vpon the poore car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cases of men: and yet for all this, looke what through an whole age, hath beene receiued for holsome &amp; healthfull ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration, in another succeeding, is reiected as most preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall and pernitious. So that the applications and medicine of their first founders, is now of no woorth, except they haue recourse to minerals, wherein likewise as they confesse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues they haue attained to qualitie; but of quantitie are as yet altogether ignorant. The like may be said of all Arts and professions amongst men, wherein there is that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion and incertaintie, as the doings of one are reprehended by another for most vaine and foolish. But if you enter into the particular humours and enclinations of each one, Lord, what a pell-mell of conceit and muention you shall discouer, this seed being so thicke sowen in all their operations, that after their deepe consultations, firme resolutions, and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent circumspection, of all this their labour, there commeth vp nothing but tares and folly, which the wisest man, after due consideration so often affirmed. One is ambitious, and hauing brought his thoughts and imaginations to a good passe, some instant folly, they being reared to a great height, (like the Babilonian tower) vtterly ouerthroweth them to
<pb facs="tcp:3057:7"/>
the ground. Another puts on the Foxe with temporizing humilitie, and yet omitting some small circumstances in his complots and contriuance, a momentarie error confoundeth all his laboured and prouident deuises. For as violence set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth hatred and disdaine in the harts of men, <hi>Nam oderint quem metuunt:</hi> so absolute humilitie breedeth contempt; and the Italian Prouer be can tell you, that <hi>Chi pecora si fá, il lupo lo mangia.</hi> Well, hauing in this Hospitall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued so good comfort, and succour my selfe; in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous charitie I could not but make knowne vnto you this worthie Italian worke, framed peraduenture vpon their yeere of Iubilee, or grace, and therefore propounded in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to all men, for reliefe and cure of their giddie maladies. I craue no pardon of my errors or faults (yet are they many, and onely mine owne) beeing but a Foole, in reporting to Fooles what an other hath censured of humaine folly: And therefore you see I neither incite you to gratitude, by <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi> receiuing a cup of water so thankfully, nor to reward in distributing of your goodwils, by imitation of that noble Prince, who so kindly remunerated the taking of alowse from his garment. <hi>Tullies</hi> sentences lye dead in my minde, and I haue vtterly lost the memoriall of <hi>Lycosthenes</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pophthegmes: this I did carelesly, accept you of it as lightly. Yet consider what patience you haue with the wine you drink in Tauernes, and beleeue me (as a poore Traueller) it is all exceedingly bastardiz'd from his originall purity: and euen your Phisicall drams, that are so greedily sought after, suffer a little sophistication by the hands of the Apothecarie. Thinke not much therefore, if so tickle and foolish a commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie as this is, be somewhat endamaged by the transporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it out of Italy, but making some pleasant and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable collection out of the same, let vs leaue all preeminence
<pb facs="tcp:3057:8"/>
of folly to themselues, as I ascribe all due reward and deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite to my originall Author. It is certaine, that there is few names of men or places, in all the moderne examples of this Booke, but haue agnomination or proximitie with the humours &amp; qualities of the partie described: but this would haue made too homely an hotchpotch in English, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scured so much wit as shineth through this whole miste of folly, by too palpable and triuiall scurrilitie. If any man finde helpe, or cure of his maladie, by deuout inuocation on his proper Saint, or Patron, let him ascribe the principall glorie thereof to him, and yet be thankfull to his earthly founder.</p>

whirleth about a thousand fopperies, some of them no lesse lamentable then ridiculous: But the greatest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience that springeth from her is this, that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually weakening the braine, she causeth man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine so blockish, and insensate, that he thinketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe wisest, when he is most foole; then deeming, that he is an other <hi>Mercury,</hi> when he is but a <hi>Corydon,</hi> or some <hi>Menalca,</hi> among the vulgar: and this commeth to passe (as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his Aphorismes auerreth) bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause; <note place="margin">Hippocrates.</note> 
               <hi>Quibus it a mens aegrotat ij dolorem non sentiunt:</hi> they whose mindes be thus tossed and transported are insensible of greefe. Folly therefore is she, who being spred and dispersed, ouer all prouinces and countries in the worlde; sorely vexeth mortallmen, and holdeth in subiection vnder her tyrannicall empire, an infinite number of people and men, that saying in Ecclesiastes being too true, that <hi>Stultorum infinitus est numerus:</hi> infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite is the number of fooles; and euen as <hi>Arpiages</hi> not impiously onely, but further vnnaturally and villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nously did with his owne sonnes braines, so setteth she her monstrous teeth against one and other, coueting to satisfie the greedie humours of humaine fantasie. This pretie peate, spareth not kings, hath no respect to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, esteemeth not captaines, makes no reckoning of the learned, regardeth not the rich, feareth not those noble, there is no consideration can bridle, or make her refraine from striking, (like a blinde man) round about, and at randone, on euery side, whole mortall race. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the hand that this beast aunciently bore ouer the worlde, so that the people Agathyrses inhabiting neere the Syrtes, or sandie deserts, the first among fooles, in signe of their euident follie, went naked with their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies

The Audabatians being the pictures of true folly, were woont to fight in the warres with their eies closed: The Arcadians (right Fooles) thought themselues more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient then the moone: and for this cause <hi>Seneca</hi> in his Hippolytus saith:

The Himantopoles voide of witte, went creeping vpon the earth with their hands and feete, as serpents do.

The people Psylli cockscombes in the fourth degree, as <hi>Herodotus</hi> reporteth, fought with armed ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds against the south wind, being preiudicial to them: The Tonemphians halfe out of their wits, seriously made choise of adogge insteade of a king, and by the motions and waggings of his taile, they presaged em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires and dominions, which they were to possesse. But who doth not perceiue what folly raigneth amongst men, when the learned, who shoulde bee wiser then others, shewe themselues otherwhiles more foolish, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming things which babies woulde scarce beleeue, and all the Magpies in a countrie would hardly vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe to chatter such foppish flimflams as they doe: Is not that of <hi>Plinies</hi> a goodly gullerie, that <hi>Phileta Coo,</hi> a compounder of Elegies, was of so light and subtile a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, <note place="margin">Plinie.</note> as that it was requisite to fasten lead to the soles of his feete, to the end a blast of winde might not carrie him quite away?

This man, it may be, was a follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the Philosopher <hi>Protagoras</hi> his sect, who like a foolish dolt, was so impudent, as to affirme, that whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer seemeth vnto a man, to be in conceit, is so indeed: so that <hi>Plato</hi> bestowed a little paines in condemning this Sot, to a thousand gallowes, saying, if this position were true, then he was of opinion that <hi>Protagoras</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise had vttered a notable foolerie, this man affirming, that by his owne reason it followed, that he was therfore himselfe a foole. But he that would amply discourse of all the foolish toyes, that by learned men haue beene set abroach, and make mention of all those, which worldly men haue practised, should vndertake a burthen able to wearie <hi>Atlas</hi> himselfe; much more, the feeble wit, and weake memorie of a meane writer, as I am: It sufficeth that with the wise man, euerie one may iustly exclayme, <hi>Vidi cuncta, quae fiunt sub sole, &amp; ecce vniuersavanitas, &amp;</hi>

When were there such a number of these Almanakes or lying weather Authors being to be sold in the Burse, or Rialto, euen to the ridiculous prognostication of one that supped vp an hundred egs in a morning, that he might not be driuen to take Inne, with this charitable Hospitall of Fooles; yet could not this silly wretch auoide the malignant influence of the stars, and planets, and his owne infortunate constella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for he is forced to enter into the Hospitall of incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Cockscombs, for a farthing Astrologer, because much after this rate, is his hamper merchandize sold at.

is a certaine inflammation of the organicall parts of the braine, which induceth a kind of dotage, and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous percussion of the minde, whereupon they are saide to be franticke and doting, whom such a strong and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing passion surpriseth. But <hi>Trallianus,</hi> that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <note place="margin">Trallianus.</note> phisition in the thirteenth chapter of his first booke is of opinion, that Frensie is a tumour or inflammation of the braine, or of the membranes thereof: And <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>

               <hi>Medicus</hi> in the sixt chapter of his third Booke pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth his opinion of the same after this manner; that Frensie is an inflammation of the membranes of the braine; yet so, that sometimes the braine it selfe, seemeth togither with them co-inflamed, and that in it may be perceiued otherwhiles, a certaine heate, besides that which we call vigor, or heat naturall. <hi>Galen</hi> afterwards in the second of the causes of Symptomes, plainely main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth, that the reside<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of passion, is as wel in the brain it selfe, as in the membranes: and the greater part of Phisitions iumpe with him, but especially amongst those of late daies <hi>Altomar</hi> in the sixt chapter of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinall <note place="margin">Altomar.</note> methode. Yet the Phisitions doe make some difference, betweene Frensie, and weaknes of braine, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though both of them are associated with an feuer, or fit, because dotage or braine-sicknes (as <hi>Iohn Fernelius Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bianus</hi> in the fift Booke of his workes medicinall wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth) is procured sometimes by choler, and otherwhiles, by a subtill effused blood through the braine, or some other cause: but Frensie hath euer his cause, from that inflammation of the braine, which before we mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: and besides deliration is oftentimes a Symptome, or after passion of an feuer, or of some more grieuous maladie, but of a Frensie there is no Symptome, it effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting

But because I meane not to intreat of Folly, so much according to Phisitions, as the vulgar opinion, I haue for this cause, comprehended, Franticke and brain-sicke Fooles vnder one kinde, because wee commonly say, when any one goeth about a thing arsie-versie, that such a man doteth, or is Franticke, the same happening to him, which sorteth them, who are properly oppressed with Frensie or madnes: Amongst vs therefore ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, Franticke, and deliring Fooles be those, who with a kind of imitation of their owne folly &amp; Frensie, swarue from al sense, in anything they vtter, being inconstant, and so intricating themselues, that another Sphinx, should haue work enough to explane their conceits, &amp; <hi>Oedipus</hi> himselfe would sweate, to apprehend the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their words: for there vtterance is readie, and at hand, but then fantasie on the other side in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on a winged <hi>Pegasus</hi> rouing here and there at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Of this kinde of Fooles, two examples only may serue for the learned, the one of a certaine man, named by <hi>Seneca</hi> in his Epistles, <hi>Sparsus,</hi> to whom he ascribeth <note place="margin">Seneca citeth an example of a foole doting or delirant.</note> these qualities: that amongst schollers, he talked like a mad man; and amongst mad men he discoursed like a scholler: where, in the one, and other, the dotage of his minde was euident to all men: the other is of <hi>Caelius</hi> (an <note place="margin">Caelio citeth another.</note> Author much esteemed) in the ninth Booke of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient lectures, recited where he saith, that there was a certaine decrepit woman, called by him, <hi>Acco,</hi> (and so much the rather it might be a dotage, because the same is more proper to this, then any other age) who percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

hir face in a glasse deformed through olde age, of the discontentment she receiued by this in her minde, she became a Foole; &amp; in this hir mad folly, she spoke to her owne face in the glasse, laughed, and talked to it: sometimes shee woulde threaten, otherwhiles shee woulde promise it somewhat; sometimes shee flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered it, and anone after a franticke manner shee woulde bee angrie with the same; one while shee woulde bee as merrie, as maide Marrian, and by and by, outragious and despightfull like an oysterwife. But <note place="margin">Modern ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</note> amongst the vulgar, the example of one <hi>Talpine</hi> of Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamo, an old Dizzard may well be added, who not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to continue a quarter of an hower, or one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute in a purpose, departing from Bergamo, and going to Venice, before the Signiorie or Magistracie of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantia <note place="margin">Orsortie.</note> to appeale vnto them, about sentence giuen vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an house, whereunto he pretended title, as he stood before them, he leaped suddenly out of the house into a well, maintaining with so great obstinacie, how at least yet he would seaze vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the well of that house, that those signiors, smiling, offered to make him also Lord, &amp; put him in possession of the whole sea, much more of a wel: and thus he gaue ouer his appeale of the well, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried newes to Bergamo, how this Signiorie had made him patron of the sea, and also of the Buccetor. But <note place="margin">A goodly bargs or brigantine wherein the Venetian Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niorie recreate themselues in the Adriaticke sea, neere to their citie.</note> returning againe to his former humors, he had recourse a new vnto them, exclaiming, that he thought it an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignitie, when by his Admiralship he might dispose of so much salt water, for ships to saile vpon, and could not haue the fresh water of a well, for prouision of his gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leies: and those Signiors perceiuing his wit at the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, for solace and entertainment of the companie, they
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3057:14"/>
caused a writing to bee made him, subscribed with a coale, &amp; sealed with an horse brand, wherein they decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that they made a present vnto him of all the water in the riuers of Sergio, Oio, Brenta, Sile, Piaue, Taglia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento, Grauallone, Adige, &amp; of that part of Pò, which runneth through their dominion, for the vse of this affaire; and yet in the ende, the Foole for all this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that he would not haue so much water, but his house, or otherwise, he meant to raze the towne of Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamo, euen to the verie foundation, together with the goodly chappell there seated and built.

Hereupon <hi>Marcus Tullius</hi> in the second of his Orator, declaring <note place="margin">Cicero.</note> the nature &amp; propertie of one these, saith thus: <hi>Qui tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus quid postulet, non videt, aut plura loquitur, aut se osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat, aut eorum, cum quibus est, vel dignitatis, vel commodi rationem non habet, aut denique in aliquo genere inconcin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, aut multus est, is ineptus dicitur.</hi> He that obserueth

not what the time requireth, babling out many things, vaunting himselfe, hauing no respect to the dignitie, or commoditie of those in whose companie he is, or that, (to conclude) in any kinde whatsoeuer, is inseasonable, or superfluous, may be said to be foolish. In my opinion that ancient <hi>Amphistides,</hi> named by <hi>Caelius,</hi> may well <note place="margin">Caelius.</note> be placed in the number of these men; who was of so flat and rebated a braine, as he knew not thus much, whether he came of a father and mother, as commonly we doe, or no. <hi>Acesias</hi> the Phisition may likewise be numbred among these senselesse; for this was his propertie, that when he had any cure in hand, he administred to him, in a quite contrarie course, to that he should haue done: whereupon <hi>Paulus Manutius</hi> vseth this prouerbe. <note place="margin">Paulus Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius.</note>

No lesse sottish was <hi>Bastiano</hi> of Monselice, who seruing a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Neapolitane Signior, that commaunded him to set vpon the table some citrons and oranges, went into the orchard, and pluckt vp by the rootes the best plants of the same that were in the whole orchard, bringing them all in a bundell to his master, with great dammage, and no small reproche to himselfe.

But this other example of <hi>Luc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chino</hi> of Fusolara is not altogether thread-bare, for he seruing one of these that sell Malmsie, whiles his master willed him to entertaine a certaine honest man his friend, and that he should taste of euerie hogshead, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that hee should broach them, tooke one of those great beetles that wood-cleauers vse, with which he sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued more then fower, before his master was ware of his owne errour, or the others simplicitie.

Some man peraduenture may thinke that one <hi>Cippius,</hi> named by <hi>Lucilius,</hi> may well be placed amongst vicious <note place="margin">Lucilius.</note> fooles: who indeed in this respect was a foole, for that he suffred others to vse his wife dishonestly: and in this other consideration hee was vicious, who bicause hee woulde not appeere to be a wittall, fained himselfe then to sleepe, when an other watching in <hi>Cupids</hi> palestra, wrestled hard with her. Hee in the Hospitall of Milan seemed no lesse a vicious foole, who called straungers <note place="margin">Moderne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</note> to him saying; that he woulde shewe them the valley of <hi>Iehosaphat,</hi> and by little and little discouering to them his bare buttockes, he made euery one blush for shame that came neere him.

euery one that hee might kisse him, and the man draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neere, either he woulde breake an vrinall vppon his head, bite him with his teeth, or doe him some other kinde of mischiefe. It is recounted of a certaine vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous foole, that standing one day at a window, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a faire yoong maide in an other right ouer against him, as if in an instant hee had beene enflamed with her loue, he saide to her, <hi>Signor a lei volete bene adio?</hi> Ladie will itplease you my heate to coole? <hi>Signor nò, perche sete vn Sier Matthio:</hi> No sir, said she, bicause you seeme but a foole: then he replied; <hi>Lasciatemi adungue fare il fatto mio:</hi> Let me yet furbish you with my toole. Of an other vicious foole this pranke is reported; that one day in the market place he got vp vpon a butchers stall, and gathering about him a goodly audience, hee began to crie out, that al men might come and heare him: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the people being assembled togither he said; Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that I am the great beast which calleth a counsell of the other lesser; for my part I will goe breake my faste, goe you and hang your selues if you will: and thus hee deluded the people, departing with laughter and scorne to euery one. This man was much like to an other, who at a time of solemne councell, about a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of certaine publike affaires, entred into the counsell chamber, and cried out aloud: I giue my verdite that euery one of you be dawcockes. And one <hi>Norandino</hi> of Sauignano was not much vnlike these, being a most vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious foole, who at a time, when a great disputation was helde in the citie of Cesena, neere to that towne, and passing by chance through the place where all the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts were gathered togither, making roume amongst them all with a good quarter staffe, he spake with a loud

Amongst auncient examples, that peraduenture of <hi>Cleomedes Astipalensis</hi> a man of mightie strength, named by <hi>Plutarke,</hi> may well be placed; who being defrauded of a certaine rewarde <note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> due vnto his vertue, entred for this cause into such ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and despight, as one day he laide his shoulders to a pillar which susteined the common schoole, wherein were all the children of the chiefest men of the place, and bearing it furiously to the ground, he killed the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster and all those yoong youths togither. In the number

of these also may that <hi>Merganore</hi> in the Poet <hi>Ariosto</hi> be reckoned, who for the death of his two sonnes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued such mortall hatred against women-kinde, as looke howe many women soeuer came within his cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit, they were al for this cause rudely scoffed, and hardly intreated by him.

Wherefore, to this our purpose, it is reported of him, that on a time another calling him, head of a base violl, he was through this word moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to such choler, that he reached him such a blow, which missing him, &amp; lighting vpon a pillar by, broke all this Fooles owne hand &amp; arme; and when he cleerly saw the dammage which redounded to himselfe, entring into greater furie then before, he threw a flinte-stone to haue hit him on the head, which lighting against the wall, and recoyling backe, tooke himselfe on the breast, so that raging presently with double furie and madnes, he went to runne his head against the other mans belly, who drawing back, he ran his owne head against the wal, &amp; broke it all ouer: and last of all, hauing no otherthing wherewith to shew his spleene, hee indiscreetly out of his stomacke powers a belch in his face, saying: Goe to, take this, seeing I can in no other sort reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge my self. <hi>Christoforo</hi> of Crispino was a notable wayward, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitefull Foole, who because on a time another said vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

With these words he grew into such a furie, as running to a fountaine neere hand, he would needes haue cast it full of water at him: but this man smiling, and flying away like a trecherous Parthian, or snearing companion, said: I will haue the knife, the bread and the cheese, and let the cup and the water remaine with thee, for we are now share and share like: and thus did he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude the last blow of this despitefull Foole, who in the end perceiued that he was exceedingly derided for his foolish enterpise. A more famous example of maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Folly cannot be produced, then that which diuine <hi>Ariosto</hi> setteth downe in peruerse and wicked <hi>Gabrina,</hi> especially in that Stanza, which beginneth thus:

occasion only, bicause he could not dissolue an aenigma or doubtfull question, the which by channce was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded vnto him by certaine sailers or marriners.

A like example to this, is that of <hi>Margutte</hi> in Luigi Pulci, who laughed while he gaped againe, seeing a monkeie to put on his <note place="margin">Luigi Pulci.</note> bootes. <hi>Lampridius</hi> amongst the ridiculous fopperies <note place="margin">Lampridius</note> of <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> mentioneth also this, that sometimes he woulde bee drawne in a chariot by fower naked har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots, other whiles he woulde visite all the publike stewes in Rome, giuing rewards to all badde and common wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whom he termed his fellow soldiers; and an other time apparelling himselfe like a strumpet, he discouered himselfe not to be a Romaine Emperor, but some tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher buffon or parasite, to al the world. But yet that folly of <hi>Nero</hi> surpasseth them all, for he had a desire to bring foorth like women; hee made a stallion and bardasso boie of himselfe at one instant; and touching <hi>Sporus</hi> his Ganimed, he entred into this notable follie, that he woulde needes see him of a male as hee was, turned into a woman by the Phisitions. <hi>Iohn Rauisius Textor</hi> putteth <note place="margin">Textor.</note> one <hi>Zenophantus</hi> in the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of fooles ridiculous, who was of this qualitie, that the more he contended to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine laughing, the more vehemently he brust out a gigling. <hi>Atheneus</hi> in the fift of his Gymnosophistes, while he reciteth the follies of madde <hi>Antiochus</hi> king of <note place="margin">Atheneus.</note> Syria, rehearseth likewise these other very ridiculous: that hee practised and conuersed as well with the basest

and the carriage of their bodies is like to a peacocke turning rounde about and beholding himselfe: or to a swollen Turkie cocke, ruffling all spred through a yard: the state they obserue is like an other <hi>Iupiter</hi> vpon his golden throne, amidst all the other gods: their motion resembleth a wagtailes going vpon the ground, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie of their gate, is like to that of a Romagna goose when she goes through the barne yarde; the glearing of their eies is like to a cat, when she glicketh her selfe: their standing still, is like to a swollen toad, when she lies still beaking vpon the earth: his speech makes more haste then an Ante, when he is better laden then vsual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and to conclude, all his actions are so affected and full of ostentation, that a more strange or odious thing then these glorious fooles cannot be mette withall: Among vain-glorious fooles the ancient Aruenians are by writers numbred, who as diuers report, vau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to be borne of the Troiane race; and therefore they called themselues brothers to the Romaines, <hi>Lucan</hi> speaking of them in his first booke:

And like vnto these was one <hi>Murrhanus,</hi> not hee that makes oile iarres, but an other, of whom <hi>Virgill</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in the twelfth of his Aeneides saying:

Among other examples of glorious fooles, auncient writers place this of <hi>Misenus Aeneas</hi> his trumpetter, who held himselfe so singular in that profession, as that he durst challenge the maryne goddes or Tritones, to sound with him: as also those of Martia, who prouoked

               <hi>Apollo</hi> to the selfe same conflict: <hi>Thamir is a</hi> Thracian, who was so bolde as to thrust herselfe in amongst the Muses to sing; and togither with these that of <hi>Araene,</hi> who woulde needes contend with <hi>Minerua</hi> for weauing of wooll: but last of all that of <hi>Cassiope</hi> daughter to <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheus,</hi> who woulde be preferred before the Nereides: as likewise <hi>Niobe</hi> woulde haue beene before <hi>Latona, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gona</hi> the daughter of <hi>Laomedon,</hi> before <hi>Iuno;</hi> and <hi>Lychi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Deucalions</hi> daughter before <hi>Diana:</hi> and in truth the tribe of glorious, &amp; many-asses is greater then the rest, bicause in all times wee haue seene triall, that the braine hath boiled more on this, then any other side: what shal we say of that inhumaine <hi>Remulus,</hi> who attributing too much vnto himselfe, and ouer highly pleased in his owne valour, condemned the Troians besieged in Italy, of effeminacie and cowardize, <hi>Virgill</hi> relating these proud wordes of him:

What may be thought of that <hi>Martus,</hi> one of the basest crewe of the Boëtian people, who was so bolde as to make himselfe a god? What of <hi>Appion</hi> the grammarian, who vndoubtedly promised him immortality, to whom he did but dedicate any of his workes? <hi>Menecrates</hi> the physicion also, was beyond all measure glorious, who was neuer woont to take any reward for such patients as he cured, but requested this onely at their handes, that they woulde call themselues his humble seruants, and terme him an other <hi>Iupiter: Nestorius</hi> the heretcike was also one of this number, for in an oration that he made to the people of Constantinople, he soothed himselfe
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:3057:42"/>
so greatly, that the next day following hee promised heauen to euery one of them: And <hi>Rhemnius Palemon</hi> the grammarian or Pedant, is not farre different from these, he being woont to glorie, that learning was borne and came into the worlde with him, as also with him it was like to perish. But why do I passe ouer <hi>Paulus Samo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satenus,</hi> who went through the market places, streetes, and high-waies, vaunting publikely of his learning, and caused whatsoeuer came first into his mouth to bee set downe in writing by certaine registers? As also why do I conceale the Emperour <hi>Domitian,</hi> who delighted in nothing more then this, to be called a great Lord, and God? wherfore <hi>Eusebius</hi> saith, <hi>Domitian</hi> first comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that himselfe should be called a Lord and God; and a certaine flattering Poet made of him these verses:
<q>
                  <l>The Edict of our Lord and God,</l>
                  <l>Which doth alliudgements ratifie.</l>
               </q>
And to what ende omit I the Prince <hi>Caius Caesar,</hi> who made an Edict, that hee might be numbred among the gods, and that Statues should bee erected vnto him in the name of the greatest <hi>Iupiter?</hi> Neither will I forget <hi>Themison Cyprian,</hi> who would needs be called <hi>Hercules,</hi> haue incense offered vnto him, &amp; be celebrated with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine prayses like vnto him. And what shall I further say of <hi>Nero,</hi> who greedie of eternall fame, would in any wise haue the moneth of Aprill called <hi>Neronea,</hi> and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned (as <hi>Suetonius</hi> writeth) that the citie of Rome should be called <hi>Nerapolis? Alexander Macedon</hi> in <note place="margin">Suetonius.</note> this respect may also be recounted amongst glorious Fooles for one, he taking woonderfull delight to be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the sonne of <hi>Iupiter Hammon. Salomoneus</hi> made many fictions of celestiall thunder and lightning by
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:3057:42"/>
meane of Mathematicall discipline, to no other end, but to obtaine the title of a god. <hi>Varro Pergeus</hi> corrupted by flatterers wordes was easily perswaded, that himselfe was the goodliest man in the world, and that hee sung more diuinely and sweetly then the Muses themselues. <hi>Hanno</hi> the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> was accustomed to take birds, whom he taught to pronounce these words, <hi>Hanno</hi> is a god. <hi>Sellus</hi> was a certaine poore vaine glorious Dolt, who concealed his owne pouertie, as much as was possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, extremely desiring for a worldly glorie, to be repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted rich. <hi>Herostratus</hi> a vaine glorious Foole in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit (by report of <hi>Aulus Gellius)</hi> burnt all the Temple of <note place="margin">Aulus Gellius.</note> 
               <hi>Diana Ephesian,</hi> onely to obtaine an immortall fame in the world for the same: and to conclude, <hi>Empedocles A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grigentine</hi> being a Foole, one degree aboue all others, threw himselfe headlong into the flames of mount Aetna, to the end that men might vndoubtedly thinke, how he was flowen vp into heauen. In our daies also this number of Fooles is so augmented, as there is no place so little, wherein a great companie of them may not be seene. Out of all doubt the example of that vaine glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Tuscane like another <hi>Thraso</hi> in these our daies is <note place="margin">Moderne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</note> verie rare, who being demaunded by certaine pleasant companions, why, vpon an occasion he layd not about him, saide, the reason was, because he knew himselfe to haue so heauie and weightie a hand, as wheresoeuer it lighted, presently it killed. And that other of <hi>Valentino</hi> of Castell Saint Pietro is no lesse pleasant, who hauing had a boxe on the eare giuen him in the publike mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket place, by a certaine oste, wentbrauing and laughing away, vsing these words: This man came vpon me with a flat boxe on the eare, because he durst not strike mee

And hereupon commeth it that so much is attributed to the wisedome of <hi>Meson</hi> the Astrologer, who fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing the future calamitie which was like to light on his countreymen the Athenians in an expedition they vndertooke against the Sicilians, fayned himselfe to be a Foole, for that he would not be present with them at so great an ouerthrowe. As also in like manner wee read of <hi>Vlysses,</hi> who because he would not haue gone to the Troian warre, he sowed salt like a natutall Foole, and yoaking togither diuers and sundry beasts to the plowe, he made all men woonder at his sudden madnes, but onely <hi>Palamedes,</hi> who discouered him by laying his yoong sonne amongst the furrowes, whom the subtile Greeke prudently shunning, he by this act manifested
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:3057:44"/>
that he was well in his wits, and no Foole at all. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there be some that otherwhiles play the Fooles in iest, with that little folly they haue in their heads, it being a manifest signe of folly, to play the Foole for no purpose at all, to giue other men contentment, by such men I say, we onely meane it, when in this our Hospital we place Parasiticall or counterfeit Fooles. And there is no doubt but that amongst these men, we may well reckon that <hi>Gallus Vibius</hi> named by <hi>Caelius,</hi> in the sixt booke of his ancient lectures the fiue and thirtie chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who many times fayning himselfe to be a Foole, and iesting in this manner, at last he came to be so in good earnest, growing a starcke naturall Foole, to the ende that whereas he scoffed and deluded others, for chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his folly, he might at last remaine derided and flouted himself. In our daies one <hi>Garbinello</hi> hath a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble grace in playing of the foole, who as in representing a poore Padoan countrey man, a Magnifico, or some doddipoule Doctor <hi>Gratian</hi> he hath no fellow; so in this other kind of dissimulation, exceedeth he all others, for whosoeuer heareth or seeth him, by actions, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures, and words, iudgeth him to bee no other then a naturall Foole. In this point <hi>Pedretto</hi> of Moiano one like the other, shewed himselfe a gallant fellow: for when the Venetian Signiors, vpon important occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, pressing ordinarie galleots or saylers in their state, would also haue commaunded this man to goe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he shunned not to be in the galleies with many others, yet to giue some recreation to certaine gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men his friends, with whom he had compacted, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared one day apparelled after the saylers fashion with a chaine at his leg before the Captaine of these compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:3057:45"/>
and with an oare in his hand hee began a little of himselfe to rowe and sing at the oares as they doe, and afterwards taking the whistle in his hand which they vse in galleies, he made an excellent call therewith as could bee deuised: after this hauing a sacke full of bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket before him, hee began to distribute it amongst the companie, and carried the Captaine a great peece of it, saying how that, and an head of Garlicke, made a gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sips feast a ship-boord: and at last taking a Turkish cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitar, and drawing it amongst the companie, he began to crie out <hi>allai, allai maumeth russelai,</hi> which importeth as much, as God and great Mahumet, and began to flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish therewith against the winde; sometimes striking here, sometimes there, while at the last all sweatie, and wearie, euerie one beholding him, hee fell downe as dead, wrapping himselfe in a marriners rug, and calling a notarie to set downe his last will and testament, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in leauing some thing to euerie one, he said, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed to the Captaine of the companie a great lub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and knaue to be buried, and that being a marriner, he would be enterred in no other place, then in the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie-pumpe, because that was the most conuenient graue for his knaueship; and while (he dissembling himselfe to be dead) they would haue carried him away, he leaps me vp of a sudden, and said to the Captaine: Signior Captaine, I assure you, that among all the saylers you haue pressed, there is not a woorser then my selfe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dismisse me at this time (for Gods sake) if you will not haue your galleie to carrie the woorst name of any that belongeth to the Signioria; for which cause the Captaine smiling, and taking great pleasure in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, hee was for this time content to remit him, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <head>Of lunaticall and Fooles by season: the seuenteenth discourse.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are but fewe that knowe not these kinde of fooles by their name onely, whom at this present we terme lunaticall or fooles by season, who bicause they are not continually vexed with this furie but onely sometimes, and with certaine intermission, haue obtained the imposition or name of lunatickes, they appeering mutable in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie of their follie like the moone: or rather bicause this kinde of madnes is proper and peculiar to those, that are borne in the eclipse; or else in that in the wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or encrease of the moone, and according to the diuers alterations of it, this infirmitie somtimes greatly aboundeth, and otherwhiles also hath his force excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly abated. Wherefore <hi>Iulius Firmicus</hi> in the fourth booke of his Mathematickes saith; <hi>Et siluna male fuerit</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iuilio Firmicus</note> 
               <hi>collocata, aut spasticos, aut lunaticos, aut caducos facit:</hi> which is, If the moone be euill placed, either it maketh men extatical, lunatick, or subiect to the kings euill. For this kinde of argument I may produce the examples of <hi>Nicoletto</hi> of Francolino, and <hi>Lorenzino</hi> of Chioggia, of which the first, vpon the newe moone, woulde enter sometimes into an humour that he was become a lob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, hunting out all the neerest waters and brookes whereinto to leape: and an otherwhile, that he was tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into a doade man, putting a couple of te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der hornes
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:3057:47"/>
vpon his owne head, the better to imitate his forme and condition: then that he was a leeke, or a yoong garlicke blade, and thus ran among the Herbagers crying out; who will buie fine sallet or herbage: an other time that he was growne a sausage, or dried flitch of bacon, shun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the larderers more then the pestilence itselfe, for feare they shoulde haue offered him some indignitie. The other vpon the waining of the moone, shedde like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise a great part of his wits or braine; for he would run naked through the market places, discouering all his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie parts: and other whiles all hampered with a great wicker basket, hee went through the market place, iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all those he met withall; but many times altogither distracted, he woulde lay at men with staues &amp; stones, and sometimes (being a matter exceedingly woorth the laughing at) he woulde disple himselfe vpon the naked buttocks, with a neates garbage, running after the boies, with the filthie and stinking bowels, and casting them at those that came about him, like a companie of birdes about a madge-howlet. <hi>Santino</hi> of Pietra-mala, was also lunaticke, and being possessed with this indisposition of the braine, one day vpon the ful of the moone he plaied many fonde partes worthie the laughing at, and among others, this one is reported of; that lighting on a tauerne or tipling house, which had a lawrell garland hanging out for a signe, hee put the same garlande on his owne head, and began to say that he was a Poet, singing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer came first into his minde, where a companie of people being gathered about him, and perceiuing by chance an harlot whose name was <hi>Diana,</hi> in the Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call furie which then tooke him in the head, singing hee vttered of her these verses:
<q>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:3057:47"/>
Looke on that whipper Digennie I say</l>
                  <l>That cals her selfe Diana,</l>
                  <l>Vglie, deformed foule, and filthie</l>
                  <l>Like a rammish goate, an ape or a monckey:</l>
               </q>
And beholding else where a certaine appendant, hee sung of him these verses following: 
<q>
                  <l>You sir, who teacheth yoong men to be nought,</l>
                  <l>Shall be for a Corydon taken and thought.</l>
               </q>
Among these lunatickes we may also put <hi>Menegone</hi> of Olmo, who thus in the moones waining, tottering in braine, went vp and downe the ditches to gather rootes, bringing many times bundels of nettles and wilde thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles into the market place, minding to fell this bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in steede of holesome rootes; sometimes he went a fishing for frogs, and filled a trey full of toades, which he knew not: and otherwhiles also playing the Tinker, hee went crying vp &amp; downe the countrie all blacke as a cole, who hath any candle-stickes, dishes, kettels or pans to mend; neither was he like a tinker in any thing, but onely the smeare, and collow of his beard, with a greasie sacke on his shoulder, which for this purpose he carried about with him. These be therefore those kinde of lunatickes wee haue hitherto spoken of, who within the Hospitall haue hanging out before the dore of their Cell for a signe, the goddesse <hi>Hecate,</hi> whom as their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorite, according to our accustomed manner, wee will with this petition vnder written salute.</p>

From hence commeth it, that hee ruminates on treasures, riches, states, dominions, empires, and power, as the readiest

In ancient times, <hi>Mandiogenies</hi> and <hi>Strato Athenian,</hi> were famour Buffons, as <hi>Hippolochus Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> in an epistle which he writ to <hi>Linceus</hi> testifieth, and <note place="margin">Hippolochus.</note> so was <hi>Callimidon, Locusta, Dinia,</hi> and <hi>Menedemus,</hi> to whom <hi>Telefanes</hi> in his booke of Cityes saith, that <note place="margin">Telefanes.</note>

               <hi>Gymnosophistes</hi> he sent a talent of gold to certaine para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites, which before we named, for their iests and sayings: <hi>Demetrius Poliorceta,</hi> as <hi>Philarcus</hi> writeth in the sixt <note place="margin">Philarcus.</note> booke of his Histories, was also so great a friend to scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers,

But yet it is much, that <hi>Nicostratus</hi> ascribeth this verie genius or <note place="margin">Nicostratus.</note> humour to <hi>Romaine Scilla,</hi> who otherwise was so graue and strickt in all his proceedings. Of late daies, one <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nella</hi> was a notable Buffon, as likewise <hi>Carafalla;</hi> and yet of later memorie <hi>Boccofresca</hi> the Padoan, who I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded had neuer his equall for Buffonerie, much lesse any superiour: and he was so much the more an ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous scoffer, by how much he would neuer once smile himselfe, though he made all the rest of the companie almost burst with laughing: for he was not like the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians, so celebrated by <hi>Theophrastus,</hi> who being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Buffons borne, had on a time generall recourse to the Oracle of <hi>Delphos,</hi> to know whether there were any meanes, for the recouerie of this kinde of Folly; to whom the Oracle made answere, that I, there was: so they could sacrifice a Bull to <hi>Neptune</hi> god of the sea without laughing, the which thing not being able to execute, they remained in the same state of Buffonerie, as at the first. Yet scoffers and iesters are good in this one point, for they make men merrie, and expell melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly from the heart, neither do they eate their bread in treacherie, as flatterers doe, from whom proceedeth nothing but shame, and detriment togither.

For this purpose <hi>Corthidis</hi> king of Thrace (if <hi>Caelius</hi> do not fable) knowing his owne testie and froward nature, <note place="margin">Caelius.</note> and how violent and headstrong himselfe was, one day when certaine excellent well wrought cups or glasses were giuen him, hee therefore esteeming greatly of them, yet considering they were but brittle, though pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, in deepe iudgement hee broke them all: for if by chance they shoulde haue beene broken by any of his followers or seruants, it coulde not haue beene other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise possible, but that in his great rage and furie, hee woulde bitterly haue reuenged himselfe on them for the same.

yoong set of Orange-trees; which being come to a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable growth, in a caprichious toy, he also procured them all on a day to be rooted vp, saying, it were much better to haue it a field of Coleworts; and thus in the ende his house came to be a garden of Cabages. The fantasticall humour of one <hi>Zanfardino</hi> in our time is also most notable, who being called to a dignity, at such time when Cuckoes were esteemed for Parrats (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though at this present also, we may obserue some ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster like discipline to proceed from his successors) being in his kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e installed, he began to sel heards of cattel &amp; buy geese, supplanting his gardens, &amp; making them greenes for these creatures to grase vpon; alleaging for a reason of this his wayward fantasticality, that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> geese came feathers, wherewith to make boulsters and beds, whereof he then had greater need then of flesh, fruits or cheese.

But aboue al peruerse hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, that of <hi>Piacentino</hi> is most famous, who cast good pistolets or duckates into the water, to make duckes and drakes with them, as children vse to do: and so great was the foppery which transported him, as he perceiued not the dammage he receiued by the eluish arrogancie of his owne braine.

For entertainement of the vulgar sort, I will onely declare vnto you this other; that there was one <hi>Nicolo</hi> of Mount Frustone, who was with so great and peruerse peeuishnes replenished, as that being one day vpon the banck side of Poe, he loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed one of those water mils that stand fast chained toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vpon the riuer while the miller was out of the way, and the mill making faire &amp; good way, he followed it in aboate of Stellata, as far as Francolino, where he did driue it a shore all broken and defaced: and here hee tooke order, that there should be a great ditch made to burie it in, waging twelue old beadswomen that should mourne for it, as they doe for the dead, and vtter these words: O poore mill mine, buried here at Francoline,

                  <l>Making it (cleere before) as fowle as any lees:</l>

And this is the cause why in an other place hee descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, that when <hi>Astolphus</hi> woulde haue healed him: he bound him with many ropes, like a Bedlem Foole, as nowe he was become. <hi>Athamas</hi> the sonne of <hi>Aeolus</hi> is described for so bestiall and furious by the Poet <hi>Ouid,</hi> as in his outragious humour hee killed his owne sonne named <hi>Learcus,</hi> and these be <hi>Ouids</hi> verses in the sixt <hi>de fastis:</hi>

A certaine soldier of Brisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghella, was in these our daies a notable outragious fool, who growing into furie for loue of a Fauentine curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zane, deuoured a whole gauntlet and brest-plate at a time, so mightily did this caprichious humour fume vp into his braine, as that he coulde not discerne his owne defensiue armes from bread to eate. And like to him was <hi>Camble</hi> king of Lydians, who (if <hi>Caelius</hi> say truth) prouoked by a rauenous fury, eate vp his wife one night as she lay by him, and finding in the morning one of her handes in his mouth, hee became foolishly madde, euen as a beast that must be fast tied and bound. I thinke not the example of <hi>Santin</hi> of Villa Franca to bee the coldest, and most threadbare one of all the rest, who fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into furie, about a cowe and an oxe hee had which died, went to a stable of one of his neighbours, where there was an asse, and a sowe with many pigges, where, by this madnes prouoked, hee killed them all, and eate halfe the asse, before hee so much as once drunke. An other called <hi>Marchion,</hi> of Buffaloura in the territorie of Millaine, being sacristan to a certaine vicar about Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rese, he also through misfortune entred into these bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish humours, by reason of a fewe fetches that were stol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len

from him by a coosening knaue, wherefore gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing by and by cocke a whoope in his braine, he ranne presently into the steeple, and eate an whole clapper of a bell, to the great solace, though losse of that commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naltie, when they knew of it. But yet <hi>Peter Antonio</hi> of the valley of Taro, a gardner by profession, performed somewhat a more solemne beastialitie; for hauing had certaine fruite of his spoiled in the night (as so it chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced) hee fell heerewith into so woonderfull an amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and furious extasie with all, that with his teeth hee tore and deuoured aspade, shouell, and dung-cart, not being able to mitigate this violent humour, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides all reason did driue him to madnes. Like vnto this man was <hi>Dominicon</hi> of Guastalla, who by a mischance in a morning had a bedde of yoong beanes killed and spoiled, and for so small a matter he grew into that furie and spleene, as disposed vpon this no more to plough, he eate vp his fodder stacke, plough, and oxen, in lesse then fiue daies. Let it therefore suffice, that such like men bee called outragious, brutish, and Bedlem fooles, and within the Hospitall they haue god <hi>Mars</hi> hanging out for a signe, bicause by him they are vpheld in those fantasticall humours that possesse their heades: Therefore let vs haue recourse vnto him, as to that god which kindleth the fire of theirfurie, to the ende that blowing it as little as may be, they may of such follie be healed, and recouer their former estate.</p>

Neither are the examples of these verie fewe, for the deuill goeth all ouer sowing of them, like the hearbe Dogs-foote, and of themselues they bud foorth like to Hydras heads, and with their flames they set (if it were possible) all heauen on fire, much more the earth. No man can denie but that those gyants were of this race, who by <hi>Iupiter</hi> for their pride were slaine with lightning from heauen, for the writer or Author of Etra maketh this matter verie euident in those verses: 
<q>
                  <l>The ancient Gyants did sometimes contend,</l>

That other chamber neere vnto it, where you see one standing in the dore, who all silent and sadde, with her eies looking downward, and all disheaueled, to fixe her countenance vpon the earth, neuer so much as looking vpward; but on the contrarie, with her eies drooping, she so bendeth her lookes to the grounde, as it might seeme that her eies were concentred and fast linked to the earth, is one <hi>Martia Cornelia,</hi> of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie of the <hi>Insubrians,</hi> who from her infancie hath beene possessed with melancholike humours, and therefore you may obserue her so sauage in aspect, and in counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ghastly. And amongst other humours which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:3057:79"/>
disturbe her imagination, this one in good earnest is verie terrible, that many times she takes her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be a silke worme: whereupon she neuer doth any thing else but nibble vpon mulberie leaues, affirming that by this meanes she preserueth her-selfe in life: and therefore you may perceiue that the deuise and motto, set vpon her gate by the master of the Hospitall, be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondent to her infirmitie: the deuise being a codde or webbe, with a silke worme within, and on the one side a little branch of a mulberie tree, with a motto fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in these words, <hi>Et mihi vitam, &amp; alijs decus.</hi> But I praie you looke a little foreward, and regard that Cell which hath the gate open, where shee whom you see with a cushinet by her, and a fine wicker basket with cruell and silke, to worke withall, giuing ouer her best emploiment, with that needle in her hande, shee goeth stabbing of flies, and pismires, in steede of working vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her cushion: she is called <hi>Marina de Volsci,</hi> so lither and idle, that the whole day in steede of some serious la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, she giueth her-selfe to bucksomnes, &amp; gig-loitry: wherefore the master of the place hath assigned her for a deuise, a graie bearded olde man, pursuing of butter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flies, with a motto appertinent to the purpose, <hi>Quo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uior, eo segnior.</hi> The fourth Cell which next succeedeth, if you marke well (for it hath the gate gaping and wide open) is made after the fashion of a tauerne, wherein a woman lieth prostrate, with her haire loose about her eares, a Thirsus in her hande, and withall a little bell, seruing to ring therewith to god <hi>Bacchus</hi> his feasts, who <note place="margin">Or iaueline wreathed about with Iuie.</note> is one of those ancient <hi>Menades,</hi> by some called <hi>Bacchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> and by others <hi>Stimeles,</hi> in that by <hi>Lycus</hi> his fury they were stimulated, where this woman called <hi>Teronia Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetia,</hi>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:3057:80"/>
with her head full of good Greeke and Trebian wines, doth nothing else but whirle about, shaking that Thirsus or wreathed iaueline, and ringing the bell with all mirth and iolitie. To conclude, growing drunke, she spreadeth herselfe vpon the floore of the earth, euen as now you finde her; and for this cause she hath a deuise made, with a motto answerable to her ebriety, which is a Magge pie with a soppe in her mouth, and these words vnder-written: <hi>Hinc silens, hinc loquax.</hi> The other whom you see in the Cell vnderneath, who with her rocke and spindell, taketh a lanterne in her hande to see to worke by at high noone day, and when the sunne with his beames shineth ouer the whole Hemispheare, is a mad forgetfull foole, which can carrie nothing in minde that shee hath to doe, who is called <hi>Orbilia Beneuenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na:</hi> wherefore the deuise and motto fitteth excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding well with her folly, the denise being a mole, which naturally is blinde, with this motto: <hi>Haec oculis, haec mente.</hi> But that other miserable and infortunate poore soule, who as soone as she sawe you looke towards her Cell, hidde herselfe behinde that close stoole, couering her bodie with the bolster, and rugge of her bedde, is a certaine prettie tiptoe, called by all men <hi>Lucietta</hi> of Sutri, who in al her actions is so fantastical and skittish, that when she goeth sometimes to blow the fire, &amp; but feeling the winde of the bellowes, she starts backe three fadome, for feare of that blast; and this tremulent hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour can no waies bee remooued out of her head, though diuers &amp; sundrie phisitions haue tried a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand experiments for her cure: wherefore with good consideration that deuise is set vpon her dore, which is; a conie scraping vp the earth, with a motto that saith;
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:3057:80"/>
               <hi>Huic fuga salus:</hi> bicause like a conie she thinkes not her selfe secure, except she hide her-selfe in the same manner as you see. Oh but for gods sake vouch safe to talke with her, apparelled all in graie, that hath so great goll or thropple hanging downe, as she may cast it back vpon her shoulders, if you will heare a right puppie in deed: for this is that <hi>Menega</hi> of Voltolina, daughter to <hi>Roganzzo Panada,</hi> and <hi>Mathia</hi> his wife, who on a time was made beleeue, that a cowe making loue to a frogge, and he mooued with compassion towards her, not kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing any other course hee coulde take to content her, he was willing one day while the cow was drinking at a riuer, to be swallowed downe by her, &amp; thus swimming within her belly, hee entred into that concauitie where the cowe conceiueth, and pissing there within it, hee made her after three yeeres space to bring foorth a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which had legs like to a frogge, and all the rest was like to a pied or spotted cowe, such as those of Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie be: wherefore the master of the Hospitall seeing her so rounde and plumpe in substance, hath placed vpon her Cell that deuise which you see, it beeing a Buffle, with a ring at his nose, and this motto <hi>Quocunquerapior;</hi> bicause no deuise can be more conformable and corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondent to her humour then this. In that other Cell which you see, there is a certaine sillie soule, of an addle and weake braine, as any creature you euer sawe in the worlde, and she is called <hi>Orsolina Capoana,</hi> who is of this qualitie, that if you bidde her sweepe the house, she will fall a paring of her nailes, and yet it will be euening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she haue made an ende of this worke; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when she hath beene enioined to heate the lie for the bucke, shee put her mouth to the spiggot of the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:3057:81"/>
tubbe, blowing there for the space of three howers like a verie dottrell, and by such like fopperies poore wretch she is so transported away in her senses, that if you shoulde but bidde her voide an vrinall, be sure that like a little childe, blowing of feathers vp into the aire, with a thousande other toies, she will tarrie two houres at the least, and at the last, either bring you the emptie case, or the vrinal al battered and broken, being so simple a driz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zell as she is. Therefore maruaile not if the keeper of the Hospitall haue set that deuise vpon her dore; which is a flie houering about a light, and a motto, which in Spanish signifieth, <hi>Ne mas, ne menos:</hi> for as there is not a more sillie creature then this kinde of flie, which houe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth so long about the candle, that at last she burneth her owne wings; so is there not any so sottish a roile, which may be compared to her. It seemeth this other foule flappe-mouth is verie like vnto her, who hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten her spindle, while her rocke is betweene her legges, and nowe much amazed therefore, and staring with her eies, she lookes vpon you, as if she had neuer seene man in her life before: this woman is called <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia di pozzuolo.</hi> And amongst many other of her sotte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries this one is very notorious; that when the Guardian of the Hospitall one day commanded her to take a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle water out of the cesterne, and set it vpon the table, in steede of vsing the bucket, she tooke a porredge pipkin wherein there were colewoorts a seething, &amp; set the broth vpon the table, so qualified with colde water, as all men that were present conceiued of her minnerie, togither with no indifferent woonder, delight, and pastime there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at: and for this cause she is set foorth with that imprese you there see, which is a goose climbing on the toppe
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:3057:81"/>
of an hedge, with her motto, <hi>Frustranitor;</hi> this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prese with the motto thereof signifiyng, that as the goose is a grosser creature then any other, neither can she so much as flie ouer an hedge; so she performeth foolishlie all actions whatsoeuer she goeth about, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she doth not any one thing as she shoulde doe. That foule beetle-headed <hi>Margherita Bolognese,</hi> remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning there in that Cell belowe, seemeth to be a birde of the same nest, of whose stupiditie though there were no other signe or manifestation in the wolde; yet woulde this one tricke of hirs be more then sufficient, to prooue her so: who being sent by a certaine dame to the shops of the Iewes, about an ambassage of hers, to hier brase<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets and earerings, as they vse to doe for setting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues foorth in Carneual time, she going to a casket of her mistresses, tooke there out a paire of braselets which she had in a boxe, with certaine faire earerings, &amp; carried them to a Iewe saying; that such a gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man her mistresse sent thither that ware, to bee let out for vse, and thus she returned of that message to her mistresse, brauely gulled by that wiseaker, as coulde bee possible; and for a good while there was speech of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else in that house but of this: wherefore you see that proportionablie the keeper hath placed for an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prese ouer her dore, abroad faced owle, with a motto which saith; <hi>Ipse ego &amp; ego ipse.</hi> But be holde next vnto her within her Cell, comes that wicked <hi>Lucilla da Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merino,</hi> who is as vitious us a foole as possiblie can be, and for confirmation heereof, beholde the vessell she hath in her hande: this vessell is full of walnut water, which maketh the skinne as blacke as a cole. Now this woman about noone time besmeareth all her body ouer, and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:3057:82"/>
being naked draweth heere to the maides of the keepers house, when it is about dinner time, so that all of them agast at so foule a sight, runne away, and leaue the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and meate as a praie to that rauenous she wolfe, who without any discretion at all, doth in a manner ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie plaie those prankes, to the children, seruants, and all the rest of the house. Heereupon she hath ouer her Cell a deuise altogither conformable to her selfe, which is a foxes taile that sweepeth a chamber, with this French motto: <hi>Parmafoy que liet tanbien.</hi> I say nothing to you of that other despightful cockscombe called <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uia Drusilla,</hi> whom you see there busied about that little foisting curre, rubbing and combing him so carefullie, as appeereth, who a little while after, calling him to her by the name of <hi>Fiorino,</hi> and hee not comming, she groweth into such a furie, as that in choler she woulde hang, or presently make him into iellie; and this is her qualitie, that for euerie little matter she is so mooued, as cursed <hi>Gabrina,</hi> or the wife of <hi>Pinabell,</hi> woulde haue but an harde match with her. And if there were nothing else, yet is this one part of hers most notable, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened the other day: for while she was washing out her buck, a little lie by misfortune that fel out, sprinkled into one of her eies; whereupon this despightful foole tooke the bucking tubbe, and threw it against the wall, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it all in peeces, carrying away the clothes she had washed, and rensing them in a riuer that ranne hard by, where she let all goe downe the streame merrily, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had she recouered any of them againe, if a discreete wench had not runne in and tolde them of the house of it, sending downe to the waters side men with long poles to take them vp as well as they coulde: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:3057:82"/>
since that time, the master of the Hospitall caused a painter a friende of his, to place ouer her Cell that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise, which is; a Beuer biting off his owne stones, with this motto; <hi>Vlcisci haudmelius:</hi> which cleerely mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festeth the outragious follie of this beast. Beholde that other swine snowted sowestanding in her dore, which doth nothing but gyrne and laugh, and at the least mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter she either heares or sees, sets her mouth wide open like an oue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: She is called <hi>Domicilla Feronia,</hi> who hath an husband that blockishlie reciprocateth with her in the same folly, nowe bicause her humour consisteth in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but immeasurable laughter, the keeper hath caused to be placed ouer her dore, that owle sitting vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a whippe, a creature that would make the very stones to smile at the sight of her, with this motto; <hi>Haec alijs, &amp; mihi alij:</hi> for thus her vanitie is exceeding well no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, she being a coffine replenished with carrion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like matter, but voide of any witte, or vnderstanding at all: I cannot tell whether you perceiue her that sitteth at her dore vpon a seate, with a gowne trailing after her like a peacocks taile, she is called <hi>Tarquinia Venerea,</hi> then whom there can be nothing more proude and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious: and this I shall tell you manifesteth as much; for declaring her progenie one day to certaine gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, although it exceeded not two hundred yeeres in antiquitie, yet prooued she her-selfe to bee of the Queene of <hi>Saba</hi> her race, &amp; shewed therwith a pearle &amp; diamond of extraordinarie value and estimation, which she saide great king <hi>Salomon</hi> gaue her, when she depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from his court; forcing euerie one to beleeue, that successiuely by inheritance, these iewels came in the end to her. And yet one day she vttered a more notable
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:3057:83"/>
one then this, declaring to certaine ladies and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women who were come to see her, that she had yet in her house a paire of hose of taffata, that belonged to the Signior and consorte of that Queene her kineswo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: wherefore the keeper of this place obseruing the simple follie of this woman, and accomoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a deuise to her genius or inclination, hee placed ouer the doore of her Cell for an imprese, the image of <hi>Time,</hi> after the same sort as it is by Poets described, which is, by a Dragon eating vp his owne tayle, with a proportionable motto to the same, that saith: <hi>Sola aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitate victa.</hi> But I pray you, doe me this one fauour, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue her well which commeth after, beeing called <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dronica Rhodiana;</hi> thinke of her as of a craftie and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Foole in deed; for questionlesse she fayneth her-selfe to bee distracted for no other ende, but to enioy easie and good daies, who in this point discouereth her selfe; for sometimes shee will goe into the hen-loft, and get her into the corner where the hen sittes, crying, co co co, to shew like an hen that she hath layd an egge; but if any goe to take it vp, she cryeth no more after that manner, brusling her feathers, or cackling like an hen; but with a good staffe in her hand shee will make him stand further from the hen-roost: wherefore the keeper perceiuing these her knauish proceedings, hath set her foorth for a dissembling Foole, and placed ouer her cell the picture of Fraude, with her balance in her hand wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of waight, with a motto adioyning which expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, <hi>Ars fortunae salus,</hi> because by these trickes, shee obtayneth pleasant and good daies. The other whom you see beholding the moone at a window, is called <hi>Liuia Veletri,</hi> because sometimes she is in perfect sense,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:3057:83"/>
as if she neuer had beene possessed with this foolish influence; and otherwhiles on the contrarie, she is so stimulated by this passion, as that by long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they gather that shee is lunaticke: wherefore the other day she seemed in her speech, and discourse another Palace. Now if any man speaketh to her, hee shall finde her altogether out of her wits, tossing and turning like a begger in fresh straw; for as the moone wayneth, so doth her wit decrease: &amp; therefore you see a deuise with a motto proportionable to this humour; the one being a crab which beholdeth the moone-shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the motto being framed in these words: <hi>Nunc in pleno, nunc in vacuo.</hi> She enclosed by her parents within the next cell, is the faire <hi>Martia Sempronia,</hi> where ouer the doore is painted winged <hi>Cupid</hi> with a light in his hand, and this motto subscribed: <hi>Desperatasalus.</hi> For shee inflamed with loue, grew foolish not many yeeres sithence, for the loue of one <hi>Quintus Rutilius,</hi> and not knowing with what to present this ingratfull yoong man, for the mitigation of his crueltie and hard hart, with a needle she let her selfe blood in a vaine, venting a pound of her blood into a golden cup with a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, that imported; <hi>Si feris humana prosint:</hi> the which present being by chaunce found by her brothers, was occasion of a great tribulation which she suffered: wherefore amidst these vexations and iniuries, shee grew to a desperate degree of louing folly, whereinto being fallen, by the small loue of her parents, shee was confined in the place you see. As a companion to this woman, in another kinde of folly shee there sheweth her selfe, who hath an haulter prepared fastned to that yron hooke: for though her name may presage happily, shee
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:3057:84"/>
beeing called <hi>Mansueta Britannia,</hi> yet are her actions quite contrarie to the same: for like a desperate Foole shee hath three times fastned the halter about her necke, to hang her-selfe, and alwaies some one or other hath beene readie at hand to helpe her: neither can she by the helpe of phisitions any waies be cured of this desperate disposition, bicause she hath suffered this passion to haue too great predomination, the which is so much the lesse excusable, by how much somtimes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a trifling occasion, she will needes hang her-selfe; euen as the other day, she prepared that rope in the same manner as you see, onely bicause a needle was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of her pinpillow, and so she could not worke on her cushion as she woulde haue done: wherefore the deuise and motto shewe her extreame despaire; the deuise beeing the bodie or trunke of a Cypresse tree, which beeing once cutte, neuer groweth againe, and the motto: <hi>Semel mortua quiescam.</hi> Who would not say that <hi>Hortensia Quintilia,</hi> shee whose residence is there a little below, were sister to <hi>Hortensia</hi> of Bergamo, or Sarnie, she being a starcke noddie as also he was: for if his humour be not included in her, both one and other may goe hang themselues. This woman to shew the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of that I haue said, voide of vnderstanding, and of so weake a braine, as shee one day sat idle by the fires side, striking with the tongs vpon a burning logge, she tooke woonderful delight to see so many sparckles come from it, as children doe when playing with their fathers, they aske counters and crownes; when the maide of the house scumming the possenet, let fall some of the broth vpon the blocke, and so depriued this foole of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, and brought her selfe to great trouble: for
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:3057:84"/>
she in all furie, tooke vp the billet by one end, and with it went after the maide all the streete ouer, crying out, lay vpon her, lay vpon her, like a queane as she is. Let it suffice, that the matter being afterwards knowne, by the maides owne report, and those of the house; shee gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing euerie day woorse and woorse, as it hapned, was by her friends constrayned to enter in here, where the Guardian of the Hospitall fully informed of her hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, composed that deuise for her which you see, and placed it ouer her Cell, which is no other but a choake peare, stroken downe with a great haylestone, and this motto subscribed: <hi>Actum est:</hi> which concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth excellently well with her folly, which surely is head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strong and stirred vp by and by. Be merrie a little, and plucke vp your spirits in beholding that notable Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Terentia Samntte,</hi> who in her gestures, words, inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and carriage is the verie sister of <hi>Boccafresca,</hi> or <hi>Gonello:</hi> and for proofe of this, the other day shee sate her downe, and called into the chamber before her all the whole houshold of the master of the Hospitall, they all ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning vp in hast to heare some goodly matter come from her (according to her woont) where many being assembled together, while they expected some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse, or speech, as otherwhiles shee was woont to make: at this time (not without laughter) shee vsed a thousand gestures, with her hands, and eies, sometimes this way, then that way, seeming alwaies, as if she would euen then haue begun; at last fetching a deepe sigh with a grunt like an hog, she told them, that the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her calling them together, was to no other ende, but that so noble a grunting belch, might bee honored with so goodly an assembly as there then was: so that
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:3057:85"/>
verie fitly that deuise is set ouer her Cell, a great iob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernoll, with a large slop after the Dutch manner hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon the nose, and this motto in Dutch Italian gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beredge: <hi>Chesta, stare bone compagne.</hi> But a most Ioui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and pleasant humour is that, of <hi>Quintia Emilia,</hi> borne to the relaxation and contentment of euerie one, whose residence is in a Cell somewhat beneath, hauing three gentlemen standing by her, to whom with her speech shee giueth woonderfull pleasure and delight. And not long sithence one of them demanding of her, at what time women are most foolish: shee wittily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered; when you men will but giue them so much time, as to become so: And to an other, who asked her wherefore nature had bestowed so little witte on wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, she presently answered, that resoluing his questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on truely, the answere was in readines, bicause nature wrought like a woman as she was. It may suffise that there is a conuenient deuise deputed for her, which is, a <hi>Iupiter</hi> in the midst of heauen sitting vpon a throne of gold, with this motto of the poet; <hi>Iouis omniaplena:</hi> But marke that same fantasticall and capricchious <hi>Herminia Bohema,</hi> that for a rosted chestnut the other day, set all the house in an vprore, and other sometimes she giues to them that woulde, and woulde not; and the other day for a dried Seruise, she cried for the space of an hower, with her neighbour <hi>Marietta,</hi> being afterward pacified in a monent: she hath woorthily vpon her dore for a deuise, a great Turkicocke that girdeth forwarde on a sodaine, and presently staieth, with a motto; <hi>Tanto lenis, quanto propera.</hi> And she who is chained to a bedde harde by, is a certaine beastly foole called <hi>Giacoma da Pianzipane,</hi> who the other day plaide this fine pranke,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:3057:85"/>
for a boie comming neere to her to haue emptied her close stoole, she tooke the pot and laide it on his head, so despitefully, that the poore lad was three daies after, ere he came to himselfe. And yet not two daies since, she performed an other farre beyonde this, for finding an asse that was brought into the house, with two bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets full of egges vpon his shoulders, she tooke a knea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding tubbe, and so persecuted the poore asse, as she made him fall into an hole, which serued as a sinke, to receiue all the immundicities of that place, where the poore beast slumped into the dirt with his pannell, and broke all his egges and baskets: And besides in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket she set vpon the asses master, that came behinde him, and if he had not sodainly retired himselfe backe, out of doubt, she had made a mightie carbonado of his head incontinently: wherefore the keeper considering the brutish humour of this foole, ouer her Cell hath caused to bee painted fit to the purpose, that <hi>Megera</hi> disheaueled, and with haire about her eares, with her motto, which saith; <hi>Accensanil dirius.</hi> A little vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath marke her, who is so pensiue in view, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth on the wall with her minde fixed thereon; she is called <hi>Lauinia Etolia,</hi> who is an extrauagant and notable foole indeed, and I knowe thus much by this: for not long since shee writ a conceite to a princesse of high place, like to the title of that which those of Saint <hi>Marino</hi> in Romagna, writ to the Venetian Signorie, saying: To our deere and welbeloued sister, the Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Common-wealth, for those of Saint <hi>Marino,</hi> though they be all in a manner rustickes, and countrie men, yet liue they in a common-wealth like Venetian Signiors; and in that inuention she requested of her a speciall

fauour which was; that withall her Damsels, and way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting maids, she would come and visite her, and stay with her eight daies; for she would for her entertainment fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish a Palace beseeming another <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and among other dainties, shee would giue her one of a Beuers stones, not such an one as a friend of mine of Piacenza bought, of a roaguish coosening mate in the citie of Teruigi, but somewhat lesse, which would perfume euen the verie porredge-pot or coleworts within, so precious it was, and peerelesse; and to each of her damsels, shee meant to present an Indian cricket, who wakeneth men without a clock, at what hower soeuer they please: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vpon this worthie fantasie, that deuise you see was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pounded, which is the image of a monstrous <hi>Medusa,</hi> with a motto, <hi>Extrema peto;</hi> because doubtlesse her fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies be monstrous and extreme. After her followeth such another driuell, that of all the paines she takes, she gaines nothing but nichilles, and her name is <hi>Calidonia da Heppi,</hi> who neuer standeth still, or is at quiet, and som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times she ticketh with one, and then tacketh with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and after the sport is ended, she returneth home, either with her face all to be scratch, her haire shagged abroad, or her mouth all to be grumbled, for these bee the recreations which she ordinarily vseth after meales: therefore by her deuise which is à Pluckt-hen with this motto, <hi>Quid nostra prosunt?</hi> a man may straight con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, wherein her error consisteth. And that other somewhat beneath her, called <hi>Cecilia Venusia,</hi> is a notable bucksome, and well pampered Foole, who is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conuersant in her riggery, neither can a man behold afiner madge-howlet then her selfe, so that she is neuer without a companie of women about her, who without
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:3057:86"/>
hir comfort, would certainely bee euen dead, and halfe lost. This woman by her monckeries, singing of riffe raffe rimes and countrey gigs, recounting a thousand merrie tales, far more pleasant, then those of Strapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narola, and by prating more incessantly then a Parrat, she hath brought in amongst them an other Lubber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande, to passe ouer all melancholike and displeasing humours: wherefore you see, that her imprese is a tauerne bush on the toppe of a speare, with this motto; <hi>Vndiquerisus;</hi> bicause it seemeth that this deuise and motto cannot fitlier concurre with any then her selfe. There followeth after her <hi>Armodia Falisca,</hi> being an vnbridled foole like a horse, licentious and dissolute in all her actions, in her wordes impudent and lauish, and with insolent libertie she raileth on euerie bodie, as she did the other day; for seeing a great troupe of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telwomen returne from the feast of some saint, she founde faulte euen with this, that one of them had a needle sticking on her head cawle, in nothing so come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a sorte as was requisite: And therefore her aduise is an horsestraine, with a motto expressing thus much; <hi>Nil satiu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>;</hi> she being very well knowne for so viperous a foole, as in truth she is. That last Cell sauing one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to <hi>Laurentia Giglia,</hi> in all her affaires being an obstinate foole like a mule; and from this, her obstina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie commeth euidently to bee discerned; for not long sithence being rebuked by some of her friends for tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king at a window with I know notwho, departing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, she as suddenly returned, and once againe put in minde of it by them, she withdrew herselfe a little, and afterwardes shewed herselfe there a fresh; neither could the winde which came with a great haile of stones as
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:3057:87"/>
as bigge as an egge, so much as make her bouge from that place, she being disposed to winne the fielde, and haue the conquest of heauen and earth. And therefore in all reason, she hath an anuile with an hammer striking vpon it, set vp for her imprese, with this motto, <hi>Nec ictibus:</hi> which clearly manifesteth the extreme wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes shee is possessed withall. But she who strikes it vp, carries the game away, and makes vp the feast as it should bee, is <hi>Hostilia Mutinense,</hi> either the sister of <hi>Merline,</hi> or daughter of <hi>Calcabrine,</hi> a woman inspiritate, diabolicall, and stuffed vp euen to the verie gorge with all kinde of flagition and villanie. This diuelish Foole is so monstrous and malignant, as there is no deuise in the world that can sufficiently expresse her peruerse, wicked, and abhominable nature. Therefore amongst all the rest, she onely is left without imprese or deuise; for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Gabrina</hi> for despite, <hi>Circes</hi> for diabolicall malice, nor any other prodigious monster so much by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients celebrated, can woorthily enough represent her strange and enormious properties. So that honourable beholders I conclude thus much, that it were much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for you neuer to come neere her Cell: for if she doe but perceiue your being here about, make account that like another <hi>Alcina,</hi> she will turne you all into beasts, trees, or stones; and instead of entring into an Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Fooles, you shall finde your selues in that palace, where cursed destinie transformeth men into Asses, and this is all you might gaine by the sight of her. Let vs therefore now put to the gates of this Hospitall, and roaue abroad at large, for that which alreadie you haue seene, is more then enough.</p>
