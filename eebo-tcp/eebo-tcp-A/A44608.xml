            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis Treatise prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us with the very
Key, which alone is

Inchanted Castle, I
thought it most fit, that the
same should be presented to
Your most Excellent Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
as the greatest Patron of
all Learning and Ingenuity.
The <hi>Philosophers Stone,</hi> or
<hi>Elixir,</hi> hath been always
counted, and is the highest
Secret in Nature, which by
<pb facs="tcp:49008:5"/>
that great Philosopher <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael
Sendivogius</hi> is defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<hi>Aurum in Supremum
gradum digestum:</hi> the chief
and only means to perform
that digestion, is its appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate
Water extracted out
of that Subject, which is next
of Kin unto that King of
Metals. Concerning which
Subject, how it is brought to
light, and how reduced into
such a wonderful Water,
which hath both power to kill
that King, and to raise him
again to life, yea perfectly to
regenerate and promote him
to an endless life and increase,
the Philosophers have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
very obscurely, and strove
rather to hide the Secret,
than to reveal it. Only <hi>Bern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hard
Sendivow,</hi> and this
<pb facs="tcp:49008:5"/>
present Treatise, seem the
most candid, to trace us out
the way for to travel through
that Labyrinth of Paraboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
expressions. Here is the
place set down where to find
the Philosophers Water, here
is the Fire unriddled, which
according to <hi>Artephius</hi> and
<hi>Pontanus</hi> is the first Agent,
yea the carrier on and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecter
of the whole Work.
Here are clearer hints given,
concerning the manner of
preparing this great Secret,
than any where else. Here
are the most charitable Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veats
for avoiding of wracks
in this Philosophical Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation;
which to the end
those of this Nation, that are
studious in this Learning,
may take notice of, I thought
<pb facs="tcp:49008:6"/>
good to fix the same on Your
most Excellent Majesties
Throne, as the highest, emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentest
and most conspicuous
place for all beholders of this
peculiar World: for which
presumption I hope Your
Majesty will most graciously
pardon him, who most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly

his Studies to Your Royal

not well grounded, do
always hunt, and also lie
in wait for Processes, supposing
that by trying a multitude of

to bait the <hi>Avicula Hermetis</hi> into

of this Art are clean of another

                  <q>Many hunt after new Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
new Matter, and find in lieu
thereof some fresh new Nothing;
because they interpret the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers
according to the extent
of the Letter, not the possibility
of Nature: They aim at the end,
without the beginning; and hence
it is that they acquire their Art
not out of Fundamentals, but by
Hear-say, and common Receipts.</q>

Therefore let none in againe, that

that is wise, will make his Address

by fervent Prayers, and deep Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations
make his way into this
mysterious Science, and flee Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses,

and wisdom from beneath, for
compassing of Worldly Interests,
that therefore this Science must
not escape them, but that they
may easily make it their own: But
let them know, that this Art is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred,
and that the Serpents wit
hath no share in it, there being a
great Gulf betwixt them; and that
none hath access unto it, but by
the wisdom from above, as holy

               <p>DEar Son, to point out
unto thee succinctly a
<hi>Memorandum,</hi> as it
were, concerning the
understanding of the true and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
Stone of the Philosophers,
and the manner of proceeding in
its preparation, I give thee this
information, that the
said <hi>Stone</hi> is compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and engendred of
two things,<note place="margin">Lapis ex duobus, corpore &amp; spiritu.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> Body
and Spirit, or of Mascu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line
and Feminine Seed, that is,
<hi>of the Water of Mercury, and of the
Body of Sol;</hi> whereof we find suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
proofs and attestations in all
true Writings of the Philosophers,
and therefore I count it needless
to enlarge my self by quoting of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49008:15"/>
them. The upshot of all therefore
is,<note place="margin">Mercurius resolvendus in aquam.</note> that first of all <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi>
be dissolved and
<hi>reduced into a spiritual
Water,</hi> which is termed
by the Philosophers, <hi>the first Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Metals,</hi> the juice of <hi>Lune,
Aqua Vitae,</hi> Quintessence, a fiery
ardent Water or Brandy; by which
Water or prime Matter,<note place="margin">Cum aquâ Mercurii metalla re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solvenda in primam materiam.</note>
Metals are unlock'd or
untyed, and freed from
their hard and stiff
bonds, and reduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their first and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
nature, such as the Water of
<hi>Mercury</hi> it self is. Upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
the Philosophers presented
unto us in their Books, the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Ice, or frozen Water, which
by heat is reduced into Water,
because before its co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulation
it hath been
Water.<note place="margin">Qualibet res redigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriam per principia unde <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

brought back to what it was in the
beginning. And thence they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr,
that it is impossible to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mute
Metals into Gold or Silver,
without reducing them first into
their <hi>prima materia.</hi> Concerning
therefore the bringing
about this <hi>Regeneration
of Metals,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Reductio Metallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum in primam materiam quomodo fiat.</note> thou must
diligently heed and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
my beloved Son,
that the same is to be
performed only <hi>by the
means of</hi> the prime Matter of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
that is, <hi>the Water of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi>
and by nothing besides in the
whole World. For this Water is
next of Kin unto the
Metallick nature,<note place="margin">Aqua Mercurii metallis amica.</note> in so
much that after their
mutual and uniform
commixture, they can
never be any more parted asunder.
This the Philosophers in the <hi>Turba</hi>
and other Books signifie unto us,
saying, Nature rejoyceth in its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
Nature sustaineth Nature;
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t amendeth Nature; it reduceth
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49008:16"/>
Nature; Nature overcometh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Consequently it is necessary
to know this blessed Water, and its
preparation, which Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is a hot,<note place="margin">Aqua Mercurii est vapor igneus.</note> fiery, pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
Spirit, the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophical

and it produceth no fruit; as
Christ our Saviour saith, <hi>Unless a
grain of wheat fall into the ground,
and dye, and rot, it bringeth no
fruit.</hi> So when the Body
of <hi>Sol</hi> is regenerated by
Water and Spirit,<note place="margin">Corpus per aquam Mercurii fit astrale.</note> there
groweth and cometh
forth a clarified, astral,
eternal, immortal Body, bringing
forth much fruit, and able to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply
it self like unto Vegetables.
And to this purpose the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
<hi>Roger Bacon</hi> speaketh, I do
assure you, that if the <hi>Astrum</hi> do
cast and impress its inclination in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
such a clarified Body of Gold,
that it will not lose its power and
virtue to the very last assay or
judgment: For the Body is perfect,
and agreeing to all Elements. But
if it be not regenerated, no new,
nor greater,<note place="margin">Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>miâ,</note> nor purer,
nor higher, nor better
thing can come of it.
He that doth not know
nor understand this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation
of Metals,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49008:17"/>
wrought in nature by the Water
and Spirit of the <hi>prima materia,</hi>
ought not to meddle at all with
this Art: For in truth, without
this, all is but falsities, lyes, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
and to no purpose; yea
it is impossible to effect it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways.
Hence is that excellent say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Philosophers, That every
thing bringeth forth its like, and
what a man soweth, the same he
shall also reap, and no other. And
to the same purpose the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
<hi>Richardus Anglicus</hi> saith,
Sow Gold and Silver, that by the
means of Nature they may bring
Fruit.<note place="margin">Corpus So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis eligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum ad Chemiam.</note> Consequently,
my Son, thou oughtest
<hi>to choose no other Body
for thy Work but Gold,</hi>
because that all other
Bodies are rank and imperfect.
And therefore also the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
made choice of Gold before
all other Bodies, because it is of all
things in the World the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
illuminating all other Bodies
and infusing life into them; an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:49008:17"/>
because it is of a fixated incombu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stible
nature, of a constant or abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
root, and Fire proof; also,
because (as <hi>Roger Bacon</hi> saith) the
corporal Gold, as to its nobility
and perfection, cannot be changed,
and is the utmost bound and term
of all Natural generation, and
there is no perfecter thing in the
whole World. The like teacheth
also the Philosopher <hi>Isaacus Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landus,</hi>
saying, Our Stone cannot
be extracted from any other but a
perfect Body, yea the most perfect
in the World. And if it
were not a perfect Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,<note place="margin">A corpore perfecto res perfecta ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trahitur.</note>
what Stone could
be extracted thence?
in regard that it must
have power to quicken all dead
Bodies, to purifie the unclean, to
mollifie those that are hard, and
harden those that are soft: And in
truth, it would be impossible to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
so powerful a Stone out of an
imperfect and crasie Body, for a
good perfect thing is not to be got
from that which is imperfect and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49008:18"/>
unclean: and although many do
fancy, that such an extraction may
be brought to pass, yet they erre
grosly, and are very unwise.
Therefore, my Son, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,<note place="margin">Sulphur rubeum est in auro.</note>
that the red Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical
<hi>Sulphur</hi> is in
the Gold, as <hi>Richardus</hi>
testifieth, and King <hi>Calid</hi> saith:
Our Sulphur is no common Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,
but is of a Mercurial nature,
fixated, and not flying from the
Fire. The same all other Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
also do witness, that their
red Sulphur is Gold.</p>
               <p>It is true, my Son, that the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
do say in their Books
that the common Gold

                  </gap>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:49008:18"/>
they should bestow some of their
perfection upon others, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
would be then imperfect, in
regard they have no more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
than what is needful for
themselves. These words of the
Philosophers, my Son, are true, and
spoken upon very good ground;
for it is impossible for common
Gold and Silver, to perfect other
Bodies that are imperfect, unless,
as before taught, that the Body of
<hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Lune</hi> be born anew, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated
by the Water and Spirit
of the <hi>prima materia,</hi> and thereby
a glorious, spiritual, clarified, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
fixated, subtle, penetrant Body
do grow forth, which afterwards
hath power to perfect other Bodies
which are imperfect. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Philosophers also said pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
after, that those labours are
to this end undertaken about their
Stone,<note place="margin">Auri tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctura mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicatur per aquam Mercurii.</note> that its tincture
may be advanced and
exalted; for it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site,
that the Stone be
digested and carried on
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49008:19"/>
to a far greater degree of subtlety
and excellency, than the common
Gold and Silver possesseth. To this
purpose the Philosopher <hi>Bernhard</hi>
speaketh in his Book, in the words
following: Though we take this
Body just as Nature hath produced
it; for all that it is necessary, that
by Art, which in this point must
imitate Nature, the same be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exalted in its perfection, to the
end that by the means of that su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative
accomplishment, and its
superabundant rayes, it may be
able to perfect and compleat the
imperfect Bodies, as to weight, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
substance, yea as to their
Mineral root and principles. But
if it should have remained in that
degree, wherein Nature left it,
<hi>viz.</hi> in its simple perfection, and
not rendred more perfect or exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
what should the time of nine
months and a half we
spend about it serve
for?<note place="margin">Aurum Phi osopho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiale &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Arnoldus</hi> in his
Epistle speaketh home,
saying, <hi>Gold and Silver
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49008:19"/>
is in our Stone potentially and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually,</hi>
after a powerful, invisible
and natural way; for if it were
not so, no Gold nor Silver could
come of it: but <hi>the Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
existing in our Stone,</hi> is better
than the common, because <hi>it is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
but the common is dead.</hi> And
for this very reason the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
called it their Gold and their
Silver, because it is powerful in
their Stone, active in its essence,
but not visible common Gold and
Silver; which is also confirmed by
<hi>Euclides</hi> in the great Rosary, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Nothing cometh of a perfect
thing, in regard it is already per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and compleat, being so made
by Nature. Whereof we have an
example in Bread; which being
fermented and baked, is perfect in
its degree or being, having at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
to its intended end, so that
it can be brought to no further
fermentation, to make other Bread
of it.<note place="margin">Ex corpore Solis per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

same with the Gold,
which through length
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49008:20"/>
of time hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by Nature to a
fixated and perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:
and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
it is impossible by the
means of the simple Gold to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
other Bodies, unless the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Body be first dissolved and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to its first Matter; which
done, it is introverted by our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and Art, and reduced into a
true ferment and tincture. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
the Philosophers do say, that
there is no coming to a good end,
until Gold and Silver be joyned
together in one Body. Here, my
Son,<note place="margin">Luna me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorica.</note> thou must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
<hi>Lune</hi> metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,
and not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the letter, because the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
say in their Writings,
that <hi>Lune</hi> is of a cold and moist
nature, which description they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
also unto <hi>Mercury:</hi> and
therefore <hi>by Lune is understood
Mercury,</hi> or the prime Matter,
which is the Philosophers <hi>Lune,</hi> or

               </p>
               <p>And thus, my Son, thou art in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
briefly, that no profit is to

                  </note> And St. <hi>Peter</hi>

shall melt with fervent heat; the
Earth also, and the Works that
are therein, shall be burnt up, and
that there will be a new World,
very glorious, excellent and good,
as <hi>in Apocalypsi</hi> is described. And
hereupon the Philosopher conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
according to what hath been
alledged out of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> that
there shall happen a destruction of
the Elementary World by Fire.
Observe in this Art, that the Fire
must perform the like in its type
in Nature. Therefore, my Son, set
thy thoughts upon this
Water,<note place="margin">Corpus So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis corrum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendum per aquam Mercurii.</note> wherewith the
Body of <hi>Sol</hi> (which, as
<hi>Rogerius</hi> witnesseth, is a
perfect created World)
is burnt up, and destroyed and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
that it is not a common
Fire, in regard the common is not
able to burn or destroy the Gold:
but it is a supernatural incombu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stible
Fire, the strongest of all
Fires, yea a Hellish Fire, which
only hath power to burn the Gold,
and to set the same free from its
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49008:22"/>
stiff and hard bonds. This super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
Fire, which hàth such a
power over the Gold and other
Metallick Bodies, is nothing else
but <hi>the spiritual sulphureous fiery
Water of Mercury,</hi> wherein the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of <hi>Sol</hi> is dissolved and burnt up,
and of this dissolved and destroyed
Body, a new World likewise is
created and born, and the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Jerusalem,</hi> that is an eternal,
clarified, subtle, penetrant, fixated
Body, which is able to penetrate
and perfect all other Bodies.
Hence <hi>Rogerius</hi> saith, As that is to
be a supernatural Fire, which is to
break and melt into one another
the Elements of the whole World;
and as out of the broken cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
Work of the dissolved Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
a new Work will be born,
which will be an everlasting Work;
even so the Holy Trinity hath
shewed and signified unto us like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
a supernatural Fire in the
Heavenly Stone. This supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Fire, my Son, the Philosophers
have hidden in their Books in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabolical
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49008:22"/>
expressions, naming the
same by innumerable names, and
especially they term it
<hi>Balneum Mariae,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Nimina a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curii.</note> a moist
Horse-dung, <hi>Menstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
Urine, Milk, Bloud,
<hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> and the like. Of this
Fire, saith <hi>Bernhardus,</hi>
make a vaporous Fire,<note place="margin">Ignis Bern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hardi.</note>
continual, digesting, not
violent, subtle, airy, clear, close,
incombustible, penetrant and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal:
and thereupon he speaketh
further, Truly, I have told thee
all the manner and circumstances
of the Fire, which only performeth
all, and therefore he bids the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
to consider well and often the
words he said concerning the Fire.
Consequently, he that is wise will
easily perceive thence, that those
words are not to be understood of
a common, but of a supernatural
Fire; which also <hi>Mary</hi> the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tess
doth hint, saying, that the
Element of Water doth dissolve
the Bodies, and make them white.
And concerning this Fire (which

And moreover he saith in figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

composed of Horse-dung and <hi>Calx

for it is warm and

but it is no common Horse-dung,
as many ignorant persons do sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and understand. Hence saith
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49008:23"/>
the Philosopher <hi>Alanus,</hi> the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers
called the moist Fire Horse-dung,
in which moisture is kept
the occult heat, because it is the
property of the Fire existing in the
Horse belly, not to destroy Gold,
but by reason of its moisture to
increase it. To the like purpose
speaketh <hi>Alchidonius:</hi> Our Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
must be hidden in moist Horse-dung,
which is the Philosophers
Fire. And <hi>Alanus:</hi> Dear Son, be
careful in the work of Putrefaction
or Destruction, which is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
in a gentle heat, that is,
in moist Horse-dung. <hi>Arnoldus de
Villâ novâ,</hi> in the 9th. chap. saith,
that the heat of Horse-dung is
their Fire. So likewise <hi>Alphidius:</hi>
it is digested and buried in the heat
of Horse-dung. And <hi>Aristotle:</hi> the
Earth or Body will enjoy no virtue,
unless it be sublimed by the means
of Horse-dung. And therefore,
saith <hi>Hermes,</hi> roast and cook it in
the heat of Horse-dung. And <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienus:</hi>
if thou do not find in
Horse-dung what thou lookest for,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49008:24"/>
thou hadst best to save thy char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
With these agreeth <hi>Arnoldus,</hi>
saying:<note place="margin">Aqua Mercurii est Ignis Philosopho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</note> Let none seek
for any other Fire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
this, for it is the
Fire of the Wise, <hi>the
melting Furnace of the
Wise,</hi> and their Furnace for calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
subliming, reverberating,
dissolving, and performing of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulation
and Fixation; for this
Water dissolveth all Metals, and
calcineth them, and melteth it self
together with them, both into red
and white. In like manner also the
<hi>Turba</hi> and <hi>Senior</hi> speaketh: Our
Water is a Fire, and <hi>our Water is
stronger than any Fire,</hi> for it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
the Body of Gold into a
meer Spirit, which the natural Fire
is not able to do, though the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Fire must likewise be had.
For then our Water enters into the
natural Bodies, and changeth it
self into the primigenial Water,
and afterwards into Earth or Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
which doth more forcibly
burn the Gold than the natural
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49008:24"/>
Fire; and accordingly <hi>Calid</hi> saith,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t is truly a Fire, which burneth
and grindeth all things.</p>
               <p>But the manner of
preparing this Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick
Water or Fire,<note place="margin">Aqua Mercurii quomodo praeparan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da.</note>
that is, the <hi>Aqua Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curii,</hi>
the Philosophers
have concealed; however <hi>Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund
Lullie</hi> of all hath written best
of it, though in dark expressions.
Accordingly, first of all it will be
requisite, <hi>to purge Mercury from its
extraneous humidity and terrene
terrestriety, yet so, as not by means
of corruptible things;</hi> for by such
its noble, fruitful, viridescent and
generating Nature would be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
<hi>Avicen, Arnoldus, Geber, Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundus,
in Codicillo,</hi> and other Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
besides, say, that <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi>
is best cleansed by subliming
it from common Salt, which done,
the sublimate to be thrown into
warm Water, which will dissolve
and sever the Spirit of Salt from
it; afterwards the sublimate being
dryed and mixed with Salt of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:49008:25"/>
and forced through a Retort,
it will revive again, and this to be
done divers times, and by this
proceeding <hi>Mercury</hi> will be freed
somewhat from its extraneous moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
and feculency; and <hi>Bernhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>
towards the end of his Epistle
saith, that this purgation doth not
hurt <hi>Mercury,</hi> in regard that the
hot Water and Salt do not pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
into its substance. But it is
to be noted here, my
Son,<note place="margin">Praparatio aqua Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curii diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilis.</note> that in regard that
<hi>Mercury</hi> is of an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
indivisible sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
it cannot be
truly and perfectly cleansed by
such an extraneous means, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
because <hi>its terrestrial impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
lies hid in its inmost center,</hi>
which by no Sublimation is to be

                  </gap>vered thence, as many ignorant
men, though in vain, attempt.
And therefore other means must
be used <hi>to free Mercury vive</hi> from
those bonds, wherewith Nature
hath tyed him uniformly in the
bowels of the Earth, <hi>and to reduce
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49008:25"/>
him into its</hi> primum
Ens,<note place="margin">Mercurius in aquam Sulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendus abs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneis.</note> which is a Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous
spiritual Water,
which <hi>must be done
without addition of any

<hi>Rogerius Bacon</hi> under
the title of <hi>Mercury</hi> testifieth; and
<hi>Raymundus</hi> in the <hi>Theoricâ</hi> of his
Testament saith, that if it be not
putrefied and opened after the
foresaid manner, the <hi>Menstruum</hi>
will not be worth a Fig. But <hi>when
the quick Mercury without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traneous
thing</hi> is set free from its
bonds, and <hi>dissolved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the primogeneal Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mercurius solutus po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gari.</note>
                  <hi>then</hi> and but then
we are capable <hi>to
cleanse his inside,</hi> and
<hi>by distillation</hi> to sever the Spirit
from the Water, and terrene ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restriety;
concerning which Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
the Philosophers have writ
in an occult stile, such as no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited
person will easily apprehend,
but especially they described it fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratively
in the distillation of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49008:26"/>
Wine.<note place="margin">Exemplum de vini di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stillatione.</note> For in the distil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of Wine appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
evidently, that the
Spirit of Wine is mixed with a
great deal of Water, and terrene
terrestriety: but by means of an
artificial distillation, the dry Spirit
of Wine may be severed from all
the phlegmatick humidity and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene
terrestriety, in so much that
all the Spirit is severed from the
Water existent in Wine, and the
Water from the Earth, and then
remain the Lees, out of which a
white Salt is extracted, and joyned
again with the Spirit, and then
the Spirit is distilled and cohoba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
divers times, until all the Salt
be gone over with it, whereby the
Spirit is hugely fortified and acua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
And in truth, this is a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
typical description represented
unto us by the Philosophers, which
in the preparation of the Water of
<hi>Mercury</hi> we ought to imitate; for
<hi>after its dissolution</hi> we ought in like
manner (as hath been taught of
the Wine) by Sublimation <hi>sever
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49008:26"/>
the Water or Phlegm from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and the Spirit from the Earth,
and to rectifie the Earth, and joyn
and distill it together with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
untill all together come over the
Helm.</hi> Of which preparation of
this Water, none of all the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers
hath written more clearly
nor better than <hi>Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund
Lullie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lullius pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritissimus est in prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratione aquae Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curii.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> in

also in the first Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>in libro Mercurio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,
libro Q. Essentiae,
&amp;c.</hi> where he doth plainly enough
declare, that after the Putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Separation, Distillation of the
Philosophical Spirit of Wine, the
Spiritual Water is to be mixed
again and distilled with its own
Earth, that it come over with it;
he declareth also, how this Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
Wine or <hi>Menstruum</hi> is forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and acuated with its own Salt.
And further it is to be
noted,<note place="margin">Mercurius solutus sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit suum cor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>us.</note> that <hi>this Water,
Menstruum,</hi> or Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
Spirit of Wine,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49008:27"/>
being <hi>thus prepared,</hi> doth <hi>dissolve

Water, <hi>whereby it is
multiplied without end, by means
of Putrefaction and Distillation.</hi>
But what is said of the Extraction
of this Water, is confirmed by <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noldus
de Villâ novâ,</hi> saying: It is
a substance full of Vapours, which
containeth in it self a fat humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
whereof the Artist severeth
the Philosophers humidity, such as
is fit for the Work, and is as clear
as the tears of eyes; wherein dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
the Quintessence in a Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Nature, very proper for the
Metals, and therein is the Tincture
to bring forth an intire Metal:
for it containeth the nature both
of <hi>Argent vive,</hi> and also of <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur.
Rosarius Philosophorum</hi> saith
concerning the distillation of this
<hi>Menstruum</hi> or Water,<note place="margin">Vasa benè claudenda inprapara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione aqua Mircurii.</note>
that great industry and
care must be had, and
that the Vessels to be
used for the cleansing
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49008:27"/>
of this Spirit, must be of Glass, and
exactly closed, to the end that the
Spirit may find no vent nor place
to fly through, it being very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to make its way through any
hole it findeth: And if the red
Spirit should be gone, the Artist
will lose his labour: the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
call the red Spirit <hi>Bloud,</hi> and
<hi>Menstruum;</hi> therefore be very
careful to have good Vessels, and
to have the <hi>joynts well luted, that
you may get the dry Spirit with its
Bloud into the Receiver by it self,</hi>
without evaporation of its Virtue,
and keep it, until thou have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to work with it. But concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this distillation, the ocular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection
goeth beyond writing, and
none can be a Master, before he
have been a Scholar or Apprentice.
Be provident therefore
and discreet in thy
Work,<note place="margin">Processus in distilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione aqua.</note> lay on a Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and first distill by a
gentle Fire the Element of Water,
which being over, put it aside, and
lay on another Receiver, and close
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49008:28"/>
the joynts exactly, that the Spirit
may not vapour away, increase
the Fire a little, and there will
rise in the Helm a dry yellow Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:
Continue the same degree of
Fire, so long as the Spirit cometh
yellow. But when the Alembick
beginneth to be red, then increase
the Fire very gently, and keep it
going on thus, until the red Spirit
and Bloud be quite come over,
which in its ascending and going
through the Helm will appear in
the form of Clouds in the Air:
And so soon as the red Spirit is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilled
over, the Helm will be white,
and then cease quickly; and thus
you have in the Receiver the two
Elements of Air and Fire, having
extracted the true dry Spirit, and
severed the pure from the impure.
Loe now you have the <hi>prima ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria
Metallorum,</hi> wherein the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
are reduced. For
all the Metals have
their rise from Water,<note place="margin">Omnia me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talla ex aquâ.</note>
which is a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oot of all
Metals. And therefore they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49008:28"/>
into Water, like as the fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
Ice by heat is reduced into
Water, because it hath been Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
before. Do not marvel at it,
for all things upon Earth have
their root and rise from Water.
O how many there are that work
and never think upon the root,
which is the Key to the whole
Work: it dissolveth the
Bodies readily;<note place="margin">Effectus aqua.</note> it is Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Mother; it
openeth and shutteth, and redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
Metals into what they have
been in the beginning. It dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
the Bodies, and coagulateth
it self together with them; the
Spirit is carried upon the Water,
that is, the Power of the Spirit is
seen there operating, which is done
when the Body is put into the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Whereupon the Philosopher
saith: Look upon <hi>that despica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thing,</hi> whereby our Secret is
opened. For it is a thing which all
know well, and he that knoweth it
not, will hardly or never find it:

for without this be done, all
will prove but labour lost: for else

<hi>Bernhardus</hi> saith in his Epistle,

may open the fast Locks
of all Metallick Chests, out of

Philosophers called, <hi>the Daughter
of Pluto,</hi> having all the Treasures
in her Power. It is also termed
the white, pure, delicate, undefiled
Virgin <hi>Beja,</hi> without which no ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
nor increase can be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.
And therefore the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
espoused this delicious pure
Virgin unto <hi>Gabricius,</hi> to the end
they may raise up Fruit: and when
<hi>Gabricius</hi> lay with her, he dyed,
and <hi>Beja</hi> out of excessive love swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
and consumed him, as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieus</hi>
in <hi>Turbâ Philosophorum</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of it. And <hi>Bernhard</hi> in his
<hi>Practicâ</hi> saith: the Fountain is as
a Mother unto the King, for she
doth attract him, and causeth him
to dye, but the King by her means
riseth again, and uniteth himself
so firmly unto her, that no man
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49008:31"/>
can hurt him. And therefore the
Philosophers say, although <hi>Gabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi>
be costlier, dearer, and more
esteemed by the World than <hi>Beja,</hi>
yet he alone can bring no Fruit.
This Virgin and blessed
Water the Philosophers
named in their Books
with many thousand
names;<note place="margin">Varia ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellationes aqua Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curii.</note> they call it Heaven, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial

in their Books of this Water,
to be made of such things, whereas
all the unwise, which sought it in
such like things, have not found
the true desired Water. Know
therefore, my dear Son,
<hi>that it is only made of</hi>
Mercury vive,<note place="margin">Aqua Mercurii unde fiat.</note> 
                  <hi>and of
no other heterogeneous
thing in the World;</hi> and that the
Philosophers therefore gave it so
many Names, that it might not be
known to the unwise. And with
this <hi>Item</hi> I will conclude this
Treatise, whereby thou mayst un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
and learn, that without
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49008:32"/>
this Fire all the labour of the
whole World is meerly lost, all
Chymical processes false, lying and
useless. The great <hi>Rosary</hi> saith,
there is no more but one Receipt,
and with this one Lock all the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
Books both particularly
and universally are lock'd up, and
walled about, and fenced as it were
with a strong Wall; and he that
knows not the Key, nor hath it in
possession, is not able to open the
Lock, nor to obtain Fruit. For this
Water is the only Key for to open
the Metallick Walls and Gardens.
And this Water is the strong Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
of which <hi>Isaacus</hi> in his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Work is to be understood,
wherewithall he dissolveth and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualizeth

it is very diligently to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,<note place="margin">Absque aquâ nihil fit in Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miâ.</note>
that without this
Water nothing can be
effected <hi>in Chemiâ,</hi> and
without it all are but
falsities and lyes, both in Metals
and Minerals, as also in Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and Animals. Whether they

they dissolve <hi>per deliquium, in Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo,</hi>

which seem to promise some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability,

processes of Alchymists do
teach or may be invented: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be made Oyl, Water,
Calx, Powder, black, white, yellow

melted, or done any thing about it,
which the Alchymists Receipts do
teach and vent for true, whereby
to make Gold and Silver, all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
but false and a cheat in the
event. For my self with my own
hand have experimented all such
things to my damage and loss,
not believing them to be false be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I tryed them. Therefore be
exhorted,<note place="margin">Sophista in Chemiâ vitandi.</note> my Son, to
shun such Sophisters,
Cheats and Impostors,
as much as the grand
Impostor the Devil, and avoid
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49008:33"/>
them as carefully as a terrible
burning Fire, and Poyson; for by
such Sophistry, and sweetly insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating
false Alchymy, a man runs
the hazard of Body and Soul, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
and Wealth, yea this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture
is worse than the Devil
himself. For though a man should
spend a whole Province or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
upon such deceitful processes,
yet all would be consumed in vain,
and no firm truth thereby be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.
Wherefore open thy eyes,
own and acknowledge the only
Key, and flee from all falsity; for
it is impossible else to speed, or do
any good.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to be had and
taken, is a subject common and
poor in outward appearance, and
therefore it is called a little thing,
and it is in every Mine, yet is
nearer in some things than in
others, and in a word in the Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Kingdom you must have it, in
the most excellent work of the
Mineral Hierarchy; therefore not
Animals or Vegetals. Know ye
then, (although I deny not <hi>Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds</hi>
Canons to be true) that
the lively Nature being constrained
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49008:36"/>
with the strength of Gold, in the
most subtle heat, the Tincture may
be made well easily, and in a short
time, which will convert all Metals
into perfect Gold; but the way of
the Philosophers in the Universal
Work, was out of the Mineral
Kingdom: leaving therefore Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
and Vegetals, I will acquaint
you with the Universal Subject.
Know that all Philosophers affirm,
that the Matter is but one thing,
and a vile thing which costeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
cast in High-ways and trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
upon, which is the hope of
Metals, or a thing containing all
things needful for the Work with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it self; and albeit curious Wits
hold all these to be <hi>Aenigma</hi>'s, yet
are they true according to the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Briefly, to manifest the truth,
you shall know that in all Mines
whatsoever there doth lye certain
Beds, of a lutinous or clayish sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
under the Earth, which in
some places is harder than in
others, the deeper the Mine is, the
more unctuous is the Clay; and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49008:36"/>
this Clay is the Mother of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
the feeder of the Mines, for
in it lies hid the Spirits, or the
three Principles of Metals, <hi>(viz)
Salt</hi> the Body, <hi>Sulphur</hi> the Soul,
and <hi>Mercury</hi> the Spirit, not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
nor running, but a white Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour
which resolves it self into a
white Water; I say, invisibly in
this confused lump of Clay, lies
hid the aforesaid Principles.</p>
               <p>And this is the true Matter or
Subject of the Philosophers, and
mark how that it agreeth with that
I said before: First, that it is one
thing, which yet containeth three;
Secondly, that it is a vile thing,
and yet is not so, for it is a lump
of Clay; Thirdly, that it is so vile
and common, that Workmen throw
it out of their Mines, and tread on
it, as a thing of no value: I have
seen High-ways paved with it in
<hi>Hungary,</hi> and it is no other in
other Countries. And is not this a
Chaos or confused Matter? is not
this the hope of Metals? be you
judge. I took my Matter in <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:49008:37"/>
out of the Mines of <hi>Sol,</hi> an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
so I was taught, because more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted,
and riper or hotter Spirit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
are there, than in any other Mines.
<hi>Paracelsus</hi> out of it wrought his
<hi>Elixir,</hi> but the Philosophers gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
took their Matter (which is
the same in shew and substance,
but not so ripe) out of the Mines
of <hi>Saturn,</hi> and that is their <hi>Saturn</hi>
so often mentioned in their Books;
not Ore of <hi>Saturn,</hi> nor <hi>Mercury</hi> of
<hi>Saturn</hi> but the Sperm, where the
Vegetable Spirits are not specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to Lead, but lye hid in the
lutinous lump of Clay.</p>
               <p>Now the difference between that
which is taken out of the Mine of
<hi>Sol,</hi> and that which is had out of
the Mine of <hi>Saturn,</hi> is this; in <hi>Sol</hi>
the Matter is so prepared, you shall
have need but of one Putrefaction,
but in that taken out of the Mine
of <hi>Saturn,</hi> you must have three Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefactions,
which indeed is the
great and universal Work. And
thus I have fully and plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
the Matter, the Work is
easie, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <p>TAke this lutinous Clay out

put it in a Glass Vessel, and in

Some Philosophers digested this a
Philosophical month, which is six
weeks, but then their Matter was
not fresh; for if it be fresh, then
sixteen or twenty days is sufficient.
After Digestion alter the head, and
distill, and you shall have the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
Oyl; which being come,
your it on the Matter again, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49008:38"/>
this till you have so much Vinegar
as will swim four fingers over the
Matter; then let it stand twenty
four hours, and it will be tinged
yellow; pour that gently off, and
distill away your Vinegar till it
come to a gummy substance; then
pour this Vinegar on the Matter
again, and it will be tinged yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low:
distill and reiterate this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
your Vinegar be no more tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

out all the Spirits out of the Clay:
then from the yellow Liquor distill
away all the Vinegar, and you
shall have a gummy substance like

and put it in a Retort, with a

cool, and take off that Receiver,
and stop it up very close break
the Retort, and the Feces will be
as black as Pitch, and hard, which
grind small on a Marble, then Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verberate
it in an Earthen Calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-pan,
close covered for three
days, (but make not the Matter
red-hot) and lay it two fingers
thick in the Pan: then take it out,
and either with your Vinegar recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
from its Feces, or with Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water
distilled, I have tried and
found it being well Reverberated,
that it will take up the Salt, but
I held the Vinegar the best and
most proper; digest it therefore
with Vinegar twenty hours, then
philter and distill it in <hi>B. M.</hi> till it
be dry; dissolve it again in that
Vinegar, but first rectifie it: let it
settle, philter and distill, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterate
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49008:39"/>
until the Salt be Crystal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line

this red Oyl which is the <hi>Sulphur,</hi>
and also the white Water which is
incorporated therewith: lute on
close and well a Blind Head, and
digest <hi>in Balneo</hi> three days, and it
will be all one thing or pap: but
then distill away all the humidity
that will arise, and then put it in

nip it up without heating the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
let the Egg be but a fourth

                  <p>This is the gross Conjunction
and Preparation, without adding
any more than Natures proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
put the Glass in an <hi>Athanor,</hi>

shall dissolve, putrifie, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
all the Work by vertue of
Count <hi>Trevisan</hi>'s Fire, which is
the Spirit ever working within the
Glass, beginning visibly before the
Matter begins to putrifie, for then
it continually ascends and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends
until Congelation. Be not

too curious, only pray to God, and
he will direct your Work, and

to be sixteen months, a bloud-red

               <head>The following Letter was
communicated by the most
Serene Prince Frederick
Duke of Holsatia and Sles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,
and relates things
strange and unheard-of.</head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>My Friend,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>YOU have desired of me
an account of the Life
and Death, Inheritance
and Heirs of my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>B. J.</hi> of happy memory: I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
you this Answer in <hi>Latine,</hi> as
yours to me was, though I be not
exactly skill'd in it.</p>
               <p>He was by Nation a <hi>Jew,</hi> by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
a <hi>Christian,</hi> for he believed
in <hi>Christ</hi> the Saviour, and openly
made profession of the same: He
was a man of great Honesty, and
gave great Alms in secret: He
lived chastly a Batchelor, and took
me when I was about twenty years
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49008:42"/>
of Age, out of the House where
Orphans are maintained by the
Publick, and caused me to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
in the <hi>Latine, French,</hi> and
<hi>Italian</hi> Tongues; to which I after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
by use added the <hi>Jewish</hi> or
<hi>Hebrew.</hi> He made use of me, so
far as I was capable, in his Labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory,
for he had great skill in
Physick, and cured most desperate
Diseases. When I was twenty five
years of Age, he called me into his
Parlour, and made me swear to
him, that I would never marry
without his consent and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
which I promised, and have
religiously kept.</p>
               <p>When I was thirty years of Age,
on a morning he sends for me into
his Parlour, and said very lovingly
to me, My Son, I perceive that the
Balsom of my Life, by reason of
extreme old Age coming on, (for
he was eighty eight years of Age)
is well-nigh wasted, and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
my Death is at the door:
wherefore I have writ my last Will
and Testament, for the use and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49008:42"/>
benefit of my Brothers Sons, and
of you, and have laid it upon the
Table of my Closet, whither nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you nor any mortal ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred;
for you durst not so much
as knock at the door, during the
hours set apart for my Devotion.
Having said this, he went to the
double door of his Closet, and
daubed over the joynings thereof
with a certain transparent and
Crystalline Matter, which he
wrought with his fingers till it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
soft and yielding like Wax,
and imprinted his Golden Seal up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it; the said Matter was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
hardned by the cold
Air, so that without defacing the
Seal, the door could no way be
opened.</p>
               <p>Then he took the Keys of the
Closet, and shut them up in a
small Cabinet, and sealed the same
as before with the said Crystal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line
Matter, and delivered the said
Cabinet, after he had sealed it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my hands, and charged me to
deliver the same to none but his
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49008:43"/>
Brothers Sons, Mr. <hi>Jesse, Abrah,</hi> and
<hi>Solomon Joelha,</hi> who at that time
lived in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> the eldest of
them being a Batchelor.</p>
               <p>After this he returned with me
into the Parlour, and in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
dropped the Golden Seal he
had made use of, into a Glass of
clear Water, in which the said Seal
was immediately dissolved, like
Ice in hot Water, a white Powder
settling to the bottom, and the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
was ting'd with the pale red
of a Provence Rose. Then he clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the said Glass Vial, with the
above-mentioned transparent Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and charged me to deliver the
said Vial, together with the Keys,
to Mr. <hi>Jesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This being done, he repeated
upon his bended knees some of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
Psalms in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and betook
himself to his Couch, where he
was used to sleep after Dinner, and
commanded me to bring him a
Glass of Malaga, which now and
then he sparingly made use of:
As soon as he had drank off his
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49008:43"/>
Wine, he bid me come to him, and
leaning his head upon my shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
he fell into a quiet sleep, and
after half an hours time fetched a
very deep sigh, and so yielded his
Soul to God, to my great astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Upon this I according to my
promise writ into <hi>Switzerland,</hi> to
give notice of his death to his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews;
and to my great wonder,
the very day after my blessed Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
died, I received a Letter from
Mr. <hi>Jesse,</hi> wherein he enquired whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
my Master were dead or alive,
as if he had known every thing
that had passed; as indeed he did,
by means of a certain Instrument,
of which hereafter I shall make
mention.</p>
               <p>A little after his Nephews came,
to whom I gave an account of
what had passed: all which Mr.
<hi>Jesse</hi> heard with a smile, but the
other Brother not without astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and wonder. I gave him the
Keys, together with the Glass in
which was the aforesaid Golden
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49008:44"/>
Solution; but they refused then to
meddle with any thing that day,
being tired with their Journey, but
on the morrow, after I had care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
shut all the doors of the
house, and none but they and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
present, Mr. <hi>Jesse</hi> took the
Glass Vial, and broke it over a
China-dish, which might receive
the inclosed Liquor, and took some
of the said Liquor and put it upon
the transparent Matter, with which
the Cabinet was sealed, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
the Matter which before
was hard as Chrystal, was resolved
into a thickish Water; so he opened
the Cabinet, and took thence the
Keys of the Closet.</p>
               <p>Then we came to the door of
the Closet, where Mr. <hi>Jesse</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
seen the Seal, he wetted it
as formerly with the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Liquor, which immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gave way; and so he opened
the said double door, but shut
it again, and falling down upon
his knees, prayed, as we also
did<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>red, and shut the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49008:44"/>
doors upon us. Here I saw great
Miracles.</p>
               <p>In the midst of the Closet stood
a Table, whose Frame was of Ebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
the Table it self was round,
and of the same Wood, but covered
with Plates of beaten Gold: before
the Table was placed a low Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stool,
for to kneel upon; in the
midst of the Table stood an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a strange and wonderful
contrivance, the lower part of it
or Pedestal was of pure Gold, the
middle part was of most transpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Crystal, in which was inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
an incombustible and perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally-shining
Fire; the upper part
of it was likewise of pure Gold,
made in the form of a small Cup,
or Vial.</p>
               <p>Just above this Instrument hung
down a Chain of Gold, to which
was fastned an artificial Crystal,
of an Oval form, filled with the
aforesaid perpetual Fire.</p>
               <p>On the right side of the Table
we took notice of a Golden Box,
and upon the same a little Spoon:
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49008:45"/>
this Box contained a Balsom of a
Scarlet colour.</p>
               <p>On the left side we saw a little
Desk of massie Gold, upon which
was laid a Book containing twelve
leaves of pure beaten Gold, being
tractable and flexible as Paper; in
the midst of the leaves were seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Characters engraved, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in the Corners of the said
leaves, but in the space between
the Center and Corners of the
leaves, were filled with Holy
Prayers.</p>
               <p>Under the Desk we found the
last Will of my deceased Master;
whilst we were in the Closet, Mr.
<hi>Jesse</hi> kneeled down, leaning upon
the Desk, and with most humble
devotion repeated some of the
forementioned Prayers, and then
with the little Spoon took up a
small quantity of the aforesaid
Balsom, and put it into the top of
the Instrument which was in the
midst of the Table, and instantly
a most grateful Fume ascending,
which with its most pleasing odour
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49008:45"/>
did most sensibly refresh us: but
that which to me seem'd miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
was, that the said Fume ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
caused the perpetual Fire en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed
in the hanging Chrystal, to
flash and blaze terribly, like some
great Star or Lightning.</p>
               <p>After this, Mr. <hi>Jesse</hi> read the
Will, wherein he bequeathed to
Mr. <hi>Jesse</hi> all his Instruments and
Books of Wisdom, and the rest of
his Goods to be equally divided
between him and his Brother; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
he left me a Legacy of 6000
Golden Ducatoons, as an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of my fidelity.</p>
               <p>And accordingly first enquiry
was made for the Instruments and
Books of Wisdom; of those that
were on and about the Table, I
have spoke already: in the right
side of the Closet stood a Chest of
Ebony, whose inside was all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with Plates of beaten Gold,
and contained twelve. Characters
engraven upon them.</p>
               <p>From thence we went to view a
large Chest, containing twelve
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49008:46"/>
Looking-glasses not made of Glass,
but of a certain wonderful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
Matter; the Center of the
said Looking-glasses were filled
with wonderful Characters, the
Brims of them were inclosed in
pure Gold, and between the said
Brims and Center they were po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished,
Looking-glasses receiving
all opposite Images.</p>
               <p>After this we opened a very
large Chest, or Case, in which we
found a most capacious Looking-glass,
which Mr. <hi>Jesse</hi> told us was
<hi>Solomons</hi> Looking-glass, and the
Miracle of the whole World; in
which the Characterisms of the
whole Universe were united.</p>
               <p>We saw also in a Box of Ebony,
a Globe made of a wonderful Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
Mr. <hi>Jesse</hi> told us, that in the
said Globe was shut up the Fire
and Soul of the World, and that
therefore the said Globe of it self
performed all its motions, in an
exact Harmony and Agreementt
with those of the Universe.</p>
               <p>Upon this Box forementioned
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49008:46"/>
stood another, which contained an
Instrument<note n="*" place="margin">See this Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment described in a Book cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Ars Notoria,</hi> Printed in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine or English, pag. 136.</note> resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
a Clock-Dial,
but instead of the
Figures of the 12
hours, the Letters
of the Alphabet
were placed around
this, with a Hand or Index turning
and pointing at them. Mr. <hi>Jesse</hi>
told us, that this Instrument would
move of it self, upon the motion
of a Corresponding and Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetick
Instrument which he had
at home, and that by means of
this Instrument, my happy Master
had signified to him his approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
death; and that after this sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification,
finding that his Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
remained without motion, he
concluded my Master was dead.</p>
               <p>Last of all we came to the
Books of Wisdom, which he opened
not: near the said Books was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
a Box of Gold, full of a most
ponderous Powder of a deep Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
colour, which Mr. <hi>Jesse</hi> smiling
took and put up.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:49008:47"/>
Near to the Closet where we
were, was another Closet adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which we entred into, and
there found four large Chests full
of small Ingots of most pure Gold,
out of which they gave me my Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy
of 6000 Golden Ducatoons
in a double proportion. But Mr.
<hi>Jesse</hi> refused to take for himself
any of the said Gold; for he said,
that those things which were afore
bequeathed to him, did fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
him, for he was skill'd in my
Masters Art, and therefore ordered
his part of the Gold to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
upon several poor Virgins,
of kin to them, to make up their
Portions. I my self married one of
these, and had with her a good
Portion out of the said Gold; she
embraced the Christian Religion,
and is yet alive.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Jesse</hi> packed up all his
things, and carried them home
with him into <hi>Switzerland,</hi> though
since that he hath chose himself a
quiet and well-tempered place in
the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> from whence he
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49008:47"/>
writ to me last year, offering me to
adopt my eldest Son, whom I have
accordingly sent to him.</p>
               <p>During the time we were in the
Closet, I saw strange Miracles ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
by the motions of the said
Instruments of Wisdom, which I
neither can nor dare set down in
writing. Thus much, my intimate
Friend, I was willing you should
know, more I cannot add.</p>

               <head>A
TREATISE
OF
MERCVRY
And the
Philosophers Stone.</head>
               <p>I Will, my dearest Son, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
thee in this Blessed
Science, which was hid from
the Wise of old, to whom
God was pleased to shew so much
favour. Know therefore, that our
Matter is the chiefest of all things
in the Earth, and of least estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and account, as will hereafter
more plainly appear. For if Water
incorporate it self with Earth, the
Water will be lowest of all, and will
(if it be not kept down) with Fire,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49008:50"/>
ascend higher; and thus it may
be seen, how Water will be highest
and lowest. Yet true it is, that it
is of least estimation, for in our
Earth and Water, and in that
drossie Earth, you may find some
very pure and clear, which is our
Seed and fifth Essence, and then
that foul and drossie Earth is good
for nothing else, and of no estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But that Water, as I said, is
the chiefest, will appear many
ways: Know, Son, that without
Water we cannot make Bread, nor
any thing else, which God hath
created in Nature; and hence you
may easily perceive, that Water
is the first Matter of all things
which are born or generated in the
World: for certainly 'tis manifest
unto thee, that nothing grows or
receiveth increase without the four
Elements; therefore whatsoever is
Elementated by the virtue of the
four Elements, it must of necessity
be, that the original of all things
that are born or grow, should be
of Water: Yet ought you not to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49008:50"/>
understand, this before spoken of
Water, but of that Water which is
the Matter of all things, out of
which all Natural things are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
in their kind. Know there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that first of all Air is engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
of Water; of Air, Fire; of
Fire, Earth. Now will I more fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
and friendly discourse with
thee; I'le further manifest this
Mystery unto thee by degrees, l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t
by too much hast it happen to us
according to the Proverb, That he
that makes too much hast, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
comes home too late. Now
therefore that I may satisfie thy
desire, I will discourse of the first
Matter, which Philosophers call,
<hi>the fifth Essence,</hi> and many other
Names they have for it, by which
they may the more obscure it. In
it for certain are four Elements,
pure in their Exaltation: Know
therefore, that if you would have
the fifth Essence, Man, you must
first have Man, and you must have
nothing else of that Matter; and
see that you observe this well.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49008:51"/>
This I say, that if you desire to
have the Philosophers Stone, you
must of necessity first have the fifth
Essence of that same Stone, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be Mineral or Vegetative;
joyn therefore <hi>species</hi> with <hi>species,</hi>
and Gems with Gems, and not the
one without the other, nor any
thing contrary, which may be
other than the <hi>species</hi> or proper
Gems; beware therefore of all
that is not Essential: For of Bone<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>se; which if you
will consider, you'l find the profit
of it, by the help of Divine Grace;
by the assistance whereof let us
f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rther proceed to speak of this
blessed Water, which is called the
Water of the Sun and Moon, hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
in the concavity of our Earth.
Concerning which Earth know,
that all that is generated must of
necessity have Male and Female,
from which action and passion
arise, without which Generation
never is. But you will certainly
never receive profit from things
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:49008:51"/>
differing in kinds. Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
if you have this Water of the
Sun and Moon, it will draw other
Bodies and Humours to its own
kind, by the help of the virtue and
heat of the Sun and Moon, and
will make them perfect. As an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
in the womb of its Mother, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction
of temperate heat helping
it, turneth the Flowers into its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and kind, that is, into Flesh;
Bloud, Bones, and Life, with the
other properties of a living Body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
of which 'tis needless to say any
more. And hence you may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that our Water changeth it
self into a perfect kind, with things
of its own kind: For first it will
congeal it self into a substance like
Oyl; then it will change that Oyl,
by the means of temperate heat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
into Gum; and lastly, by the help
of the perfect heat of the Sun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> into
a Stone. Now therefore know, that
out of one thing you have three,
that is, Oyl, Gum, and a Stone.
Know also, that when the Water is
turned into Oyl, then you have a
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49008:52"/>
perfect Spirit; when the Oyl is
turned into hard Gum, then you
have a perfect Spirit and Soul;
and when the Spirit and Soul are
turned into a Stone, then you have
a perfect Body, Soul and Spirit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:
which as it is called the
<hi>Philosophers Stone</hi> and <hi>Elixir,</hi> and
a perfect Medicine of mans Body;
so also that which is leavened with
its <hi>genus,</hi> and the <hi>fifth Essenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>
Know, Son, that <hi>fifth Essences</hi> are
divers, one whereof is to. Humane
Bodies, another to <hi>Elixir,</hi> and to
the imperfect Bodies of Metals<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
For you must consider, that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
and growth of Metals, is
not as the growth of mans Body;
for a <hi>genus</hi> agrees with its <hi>genus,</hi>
and a <hi>species</hi> with its <hi>species.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
know that the first Matter of
man, which begetteth the Flesh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Bloud, Bones and Life, is a Sper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick
Humour, which causeth ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
through a vital Spirit
included therein: And when the
Matter is generated and congealed
into a Body, extract thence the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49008:52"/>
                  <hi>fifth Essence</hi> of that Body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
you may nourish the Body.
Yet Son, will I tell thee moreover,
that Water, or Matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Seed
whereof Man is begot, is not the
augmenter of the Body. Know,
Son, that if the Body be fed with
its natural food, then its first Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
will be increased, and also the
Body, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the first Matter in
quality, and the Body in quantity;
the first Matter is that which is
called the <hi>fifth Essence.</hi> Yet know,
Son, that the <hi>fifth Essence</hi> is one
thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Matter of augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
is another: and, as I said
before, the increase of Metals, is
not like the increase of mans Body.
Although the <hi>fifth Essence,</hi> which
causeth the augmentation of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
may be a fit Medicine for
Humane Bodies; as also the <hi>fifth
Essence,</hi> which causeth the augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of mans Body, may be a fit
Medicine for the Bodies of Metals:
and therefore, as before is said,
the <hi>fifth Essence</hi> is one thing, and
augmentation another. You see
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49008:53"/>
therefore for what reason our Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is called, <hi>the first Matter and
Seed of Metals, viz.</hi> because of it
all Metals are generated. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you will have need of it in the
beginning, middle, and end, for as
much as it is the cause of all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
because by its Congela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it is turned into all sorts of
Metals, to wit, into the first Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the sorts. Thence it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<hi>the Seed of Metals,</hi> and <hi>the</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">So it is in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, though perhaps the words should be <hi>Vita Metallica,</hi> that is, the Water of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallick Life, that is, of the Life of Metals.</note> 
                  <hi>Metallick Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

in Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
the Red man with the White
woman, that is, the Sun and the
Moon. It is called also <hi>Virgins
Milk;</hi> for as long as it is not
joyned with the Sun and the Moon,
nor with any thing else, except
only those which are of its own
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ind, so long it may be called a
Virgin. But when it is joyned with
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49008:53"/>
a Male and Female, and marrieth
with them, then is it no longer a
Virgin, because it adhereth to
them, and becomes one with them
to whom it is joyned, that is, with
the Sun and Moon, whom it joyns
and is joyned with to generation.
But as long as it remains a Virgin,
it is called <hi>Virgins Milk,</hi> the <hi>Blessed
Water,</hi> and the <hi>Water of Life,</hi> and
by many other Names.</p>
               <p>And now, my Son, that I may
say something of the Philosophers
<hi>Mercury,</hi> know that when thou hast
put thy <hi>Water of Life</hi> to the Red
man, who is our <hi>Magnesia,</hi> and to
the White woman, whose name is
<hi>Albifica,</hi> and they shall all have
been gathered together into one,
then you have the true Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
<hi>Mercury.</hi> For after that in
this manner all is joyned with a
Male and Female, then it is called
the <hi>Philosophers Mercury,</hi> the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
Water of Life,</hi> the <hi>Bloud
of Man, his red Flesh, his Body and
Bones.</hi> Know therefore, that there
are many sorts of Milk, <hi>(viz.)</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:49008:54"/>
Virgins Milk, Womans Milk, and
also Mans Milk: For when first
they are joyned in one, and she is
big, having conceived, then the
Infant must be nourished with
Milk: But then you may know,
that this Milk is not Virgins Milk,
but rather the man and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
Milk, wherewith it is always
to be nourished, till it is grow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
to that strength, that it may be
brought up with stronger and
fuller food. That food which I
mean is the leavening of it, which
gives it form, that it may perform
Virile work: For until the Infant,
that is, this our Stone, be formed
and leavened with its like, the
Bloud of the green Dragon, and
the red Bloud of the red Dragon,
whether it be the white Stone or
the red, it will never do a perfect
work. Know therefore, Son, that
the first Water is that Water <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar,</hi>
which God made of Nature,
and it is the cause of Generation,
as I said before; but when after
the conjunction which ariseth from
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:49008:54"/>
the Marriage, it begets the Water
of Life, and the Philosophers Milk,
with one of which, or both, you
must augment and feed your Stone
perpetually.</p>
               <p>Much more could I say to thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Son, concerning this first Matter,
but let this suffice, that setting
aside impertinencies of words, we
may now, Divine Grace favouring
of us, proceed to the practice it
self of the Philosophick Stone. See
therefore, my Son, that thou dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
puttest all these Matters
(which though they are three
things, yet are they but one only)
in a Glass Vessel; and lettest them
quietly putrefie: then put an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lembick
upon your Vessel, and by
distillation draw out all the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which may be thence distilled.
Try this first in <hi>Maries</hi> Bath. Then
place the Vessel in Ashes, and
make a gentle Fire for 12 hours:
then take the Matter out of the
Vessel, grind it well by it self,
without the foresaid Water, then
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut it again into the Vessel with
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49008:55"/>
Water, and stop the Vessel close.
Put it in the Bath for three days,
and then distill the Water as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the Bath, and the Matter
will be more black than before.
Do thus three times over, and then
grind it no more; but afterward<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
as often as you distill it, so oft
pour Water on the top: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
each distillation give it so
much Fire for six hours or more,
till it become indifferent dry; then
pour Water on the top again, and
dissolve it again in the Bath under
a blind Alembick. Also in every
distillation separate the Flegm, by
casting away six or seven drops of
Water in the beginning of each
distillation And observing this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
cause it to drink its proper
Water, till it hath drank of it
seven times its weight which it
had at the first. But then it will
be of a white colour, and so much
the whiter, by how much the more
of its own Water it hath drank.
This is white <hi>Elixir.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, this our Water is
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49008:55"/>
called <hi>Homogeneal,</hi> and by many
other names. Besides, know that
this Water and Matter generate as
well the Red Stone, as the White:
Know also, when this first Matter
is brought to its compleat white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
then the end of one, is the
beginning of the other; that is, of
the Red Stone, which is our Red
<hi>Magnesia,</hi> and Virgins Brass, as we
said at first: Son, see thou well
understand these words. Our Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
Brass, is our Gold; yet I do
not say, that all Brass is Gold:
also our Brass, is our live Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone;
but all live Brimstone, is not
our live Brimstone: also Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silver,
is <hi>Mercury;</hi> but I do not say,
that common Quicksilver, is our
Silver: as I said before, that Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Life which is our Seed and
first Matter, is our <hi>Mercury</hi> and
our Spirit of Life, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
out of the blessed Land of
<hi>Aethiopia,</hi> which is called <hi>Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi>
and by many other names.
Besides, my Son, know that there
is no perfect generation, without
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:49008:56"/>
corruption; for corruption causeth
cleanliness, and cleanliness cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.
Consider therefore, Son,
our dying poison, which dyeth and
is dyed perpetually; and this is
our Body, our Soul, and our Spirit,
when they are joyned together in
one, and become one thing, which
with its parts ariseth also out of
one thing, besides which there is
not any other, neither ever shall
be. Wherefore, my Son, great folly
it is for any one to believe, that
any other Medicine can be turned
into Gold or Silver; which Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
will little profit thee of it self,
except it be mingled with a Body,
for then shall it perfect its work
according to its form to which it
is born: For it is never born that
it may of it self become a Body,
Moreover, know that there is as
much difference between the first
Matter, which is called the <hi>Seed of
Metals,</hi> and the Medicine, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Medicine and Gold: For
the Seed will never be the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
without a Body, neither will
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:49008:56"/>
the Medicine ever be a Metal with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Body. Much difference also
there: is between <hi>Elixir</hi> and the
Medicine, as between Masculine
and Feminine Seed, and also an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
which is generated of those in
the <hi>Matrice.</hi> Now you may see,
that the Seed is one thing, and the
Infant another; though they be
one and the same in kind, one
thing, one operation, the Vessel
finally one, though it be called by
divers names: For of a Man and
Woman, is an Infant born, when as
yet the Man is one thing, and the
Woman another, though they be
one and the same in kind: which
you ought to understand in our
Stone. But what I said before, that
corruption is the cause of genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and of cleanliness, is true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
For, you must know, that every
thing in its first Master is corrupt
and bitter, which corruption and
bitterness is called <hi>dying poison,</hi>
which is the cause of Life in all
things, as will be sufficiently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
if you with right reason do
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:49008:57"/>
weigh the Natures of things. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
well, O Son, that when <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi>
the Angel of Pride, first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled
against God, and prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
the Command of the most
High, be assured that this was
made corrupt, bitter, and harsh
to him: No less was the fall and,
prevarication of our first Parents
<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> whom death and
condemnation followed, made to
them corruption and bitterness,
and likewise to us in whom the
same corruption is propagated.
Many more like examples I could
recite, if need were: But setting
aside these, to come to what is
proper to our discourse; consider
well, that of all precious Fruits
which grow out of the Earth, their
First Matter is bitter and harsh, as
still retaining some footstep of the
former corruption and putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
which bitterness, by the means
of continual action of natural heat:
is with great virtue turned into
sweetness. Now therefore, Son, if
thou wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> be ingenious, this little
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49008:57"/>
will suffice whereby to find out
much more, and to perceive my
meaning: Consider therefore well,
Son, that according to the old
Proverb,
<q>He sweet deserves not, who n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

tasts.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But now to speak something
more of our Brass; know, that
Brass signifies continuance, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
Water: But what is far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be considered in the nature,
of the name of Brass, you may
easily gather from its <hi>English</hi> Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tragrammate
name, that is, its
name consisting of four letters,
to wit, <hi>B. R. A. S.</hi> First therefore,

our Olive and our Brass continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in its form: by <hi>R.</hi> is signified
the Root of our Work, and the

which is our Red Tincture,
and Red Rose which puri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

out of whom was born the first wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<hi>Eve;</hi> whence you may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that therein is Male and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male.
Know therefore, that our
Brass is the beginning of our
Work, our Gold and Olive, for it
is the first Matter of Metals, as
Man is the first of Man and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
<hi>S.</hi> signifies the Soul of our
Life, and Spirit of Life, which God
breathed into <hi>Adam,</hi> and all the
Creatures; which Spirit is called
the <hi>fifth Essence.</hi> Moreover, Son,
by these four Letters, we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the four Elements, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which nothing is generated in
Nature. They also signifie <hi>Sol</hi> and
<hi>Lune,</hi> which are the causes of all
Life, Generation, and augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of all things born in the
World. In this name therefore of
four Letters, consisteth our whole
Work: For our Brass is Male and
Female, of which ariseth he who is
called <hi>begot.</hi> Therefore, Son, take
good notice what is signified by
our sweet Brass, what is called our
<hi>Sandiver,</hi> or the Salt of our <hi>Nitre,</hi>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:49008:58"/>
or <hi>Nitre;</hi> what also by the Bloud
of the Dragon, what <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Lune,</hi>
our <hi>Mercury,</hi> and our Water of
Life, and many other things, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which Philosophers have
spoken darkly, and in Riddles.
Know therefore, Son, that our first
Matter is neither Gold, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Silver, nor is it of corrosives,
or such like outward things, which
<hi>Denigrators</hi> groping in the dark
now-a-days do use. Take heed
therefore, Son, that by no means
you admit any thing contrary in
kind; for be assured, that what a
man shall have sowed, the same
shall he reap. Moreover, know
that when our Stone is compleated
in its proper kind, then it will be
a hard Stone, which will not easily
be dissolved; yet if you add his
Wife to him, he will be dissolved
into Oyl, which is called the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers
Oyl, incombustible Oyl,
and by many other names. Know
therefore, Son, that there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
leavenings, as well Corporal
as Spiritual, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Corporal in
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49008:59"/>
quantity, and Spiritual in quality:
Corporal leavening increaseth the
weight and quantity of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,
yet is not of so great power
as the Medicine it self, as is Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
leavening; for it only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth
the Medicine in quantity,
not in virtue: but Spiritual lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening
increaseth it in both; and
where the Corporal ruleth above
an hundred, the Spiritual above a
thousand. Moreover, as long as
the Medicine is leavened by Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
qualities, so long it is called
the Medicine; but when it is lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened
with the Corporal substance,
it is called <hi>Elixir.</hi> There is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a divers manner of leavening,
and a difference between the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,
and the <hi>Elixir;</hi> for the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
is one thing, the Corporal
another. Know also, that as long
as it is Spiritual leavening, it is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid
Oyl and Gum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
conveniently be carried about
from one place to another; but
when it is Corporal, then it will

about in your Pocket. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you see what is the difference
between the Medicine, and the
<hi>Elixir;</hi> nor is the difference lessbetween
<hi>Elixir,</hi> and Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
for Gold and Silver are diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to melt, but <hi>Elixir</hi> not so, for
it easily dissolves at the flame of a
Candle: thence you may easily
perceive, how various the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
of our composition and
temperament are. Lastly, that we
may say something concerning
their food and drink, know that
their food is of airy Stones, and
their drink is drawn out of two
perfect Bodies, namely, out of the
<hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon;</hi> the drink that is
drawn out of the <hi>Sun,</hi> is called li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid
Gold, (or Potable, that is,
that may be drank;) but that out
of the <hi>Moon,</hi> is called Virgins Milk.
Now, Son, we have discoursed
plainly enough with thee, if Divine
Grace be not wanting to thee;
for that drink that is drawn out
of the <hi>Sun,</hi> is red, but that out of
the <hi>Moon,</hi> is white; and therefore
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:49008:60"/>
one is called liquid Gold, but the
other Virgins Milk; one is Mascu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line,
the other Feminine, though
both ariseth out of one Image, and
one kind. Son, ponder my words,
otherwise if thou wanderest in the
dark, that evil befalls thee from
defect of light: See therefore that
thou beest diligent in turning the
Philosophick Wheel, that thou
mayst make Water out of Earth,
Air out of Water, Fire out of Air,
and Earth out of Fire, and all this
out of one Image and Root, that is,
out of its own proper kind, and
natural food wherewith its Life
may be cherished without end. He
who hath understanding, let him
understand.</p>

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:49008:61"/>
But you must have Black
which must come and proceed of
perfect Metalline Bodies, by a real
Putrefaction, and to continue a

            <p>As for the colours of Blew and

perfectly finished, and that the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
of our <hi>Mercury</hi> are not yet
well mingled with the rest.</p>
            <p>The Black aforesaid is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

            <p>Orange colour then doth shew

               <p>MAny and great are
the Secrets of Nature,
and concerning them
and the way to attain
them, the wise Philosophers have
writ much, but in a very dark and
Aenigmatical stile, so that very
few are those that attain to any
thing of their desires by them; but
on the contrary, after much time,
labour, and cost in vain expended
in the search of them, are forced
to give over at last, and surcease
their further inquiry, and instead
of the desired satisfaction, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
from their lost labours, that
the Books of the Philosophers are
only fabulous, and writ to deceive
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:49008:64"/>
the unwary, and those that thirst
after so great a Treasure. But I
vow unto thee by Almighty God,
that what they have wrote is a
real Truth, though delivered in so
dark and dubious a way, that few
are able to understand and receive
benefit from them. I do therefore
attest the truth of their Medicines,
as well for the transmutation of
the baser and imperfect Metals in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Gold and Silver, as for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of Humane Bodies, and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all Bodily Diseases, till God
calls for the Soul; and this above
all the Medicines of <hi>Galen</hi> and
<hi>Hippocrates.</hi> But because many
great lovers of Knowledge, and
this Science, have so often failed
of obtaining the end of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
in these Mysteries of Nature,
and not only failed as to the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment
of their desires in
full, but also came short of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the principal subject, and
ground of Philosophical Secrets:
I have therefore thought fit to
help them by this small Script, as
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:49008:64"/>
much as I may, and save them the
troubles of that search; and by
telling them in plain terms and
words the true Matter, enlighten
and encourage their dubious minds
to the farther search after what
they desire: for let them assure
themselves, it is no small advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to be assured of the true
Matter and ground-work, or Basis
of so great <hi>Arcana</hi>'s, and hereon
great and innumerable blessings
do depend. I do therefore most
faithfully assure thee, that the
true Subject of this Art is <hi>Quick-silver,</hi>
in a double manner, <hi>viz.</hi>
either <hi>Quick-silver</hi> Natural, or
<hi>Quick-silver</hi> of Bodies, <hi>viz.</hi> the
Bodies of <hi>Sol</hi> or <hi>Luna,</hi> reduced
to <hi>Mercury vive;</hi> for many and
strange things may be performed
by either, singly of themselves, or
else conjoyned. The conjunction
of the <hi>Mercury</hi> of Gold or Silver,
with the common <hi>Mercury;</hi> or the
Bodies, or the Oyl of Gold and
Silver, dissolved in the <hi>Aqua Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curii,</hi>
doth much hasten the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:49008:65"/>
of Medicines for Metals:
But we need not (as absolutely
necessary) any more than the
common <hi>Mercury</hi> or <hi>Quick-silver,</hi>
dissolved lightly, either for <hi>Elixirs</hi>
or precious Stones; only small
Natural Stones must be dissolved
in the Mercurial Water, so shall
you have such Stones again as you
dissolve, and those of what bigness
you please, far exceeding Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ones.</p>
               <p>The next great Secret of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers,
is the preparation of
common <hi>Quick-silver</hi> or <hi>Mercury;</hi>
for common <hi>Mercury,</hi> as Nature
produceth it, is not fit for such
operations, nor can they any way
be performed by it: for our <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi>
is not the common <hi>Mercury</hi>
or <hi>Quick-silver,</hi> but is made of it,
by a true Philosophical skill; it
is not the white <hi>Mercury</hi> or <hi>Quick-silver,</hi>
but its subtle, spiritual,
airie and fiery parts, the earthy
and watery being prudently sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.
For the manifestation of
our <hi>Mercury,</hi> the true <hi>Mercury</hi> of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:49008:65"/>
Philosophers, first prepare the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<hi>Mercury</hi> by a due Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
preparation, until thou hast
separated and purged him from
his two extremes or excrements,
Earth and Water: dissolve it then,
after its purification, into a Milkie,
Crystalline, and Silver Liquor or
Water, which in three or four
months is to be done: being once
dissolved, thou mayst ever after
dissolve more and more <hi>Mercury</hi>
in fully fourty days, for <hi>Mercury</hi>
once dissolved, dissolveth it self
ever after infinitely. And having
dissolved it, distill it perfectly,
until it have no Faeces in the
<hi>Cornuae;</hi> after Distillation, bring
it again to Putrefaction, and when
it is blackish, distill it again: so
shalt thou have two Oyls, a white
Silver Oyl, and thickish, and at
last a very red or Bloud-like Oyl,
which is the Element of Fire. The
white Oyl serveth for Multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or multiplying the white
<hi>Elixir,</hi> and for the making of all
precious Stones, by dissolving of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:49008:66"/>
small precious Stones in it, for it
will presently dissolve them: then
in a gentle heat of Ashes congeal
them again, and they far exceed
any Natural ones, both in lustre,
and virtue, and hardness. The red
Oyl is for the multiplying the red
<hi>Elixir,</hi> even to an infinite height
in projection; which when it is by
often multiplying or multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
brought to a fixt Oyl, then
thou mayst do several Magical,
yet Natural and strange Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
by it.</p>
               <p>To make the <hi>Elixirs</hi> thou must
proceed thus: When thou hast
dissolved rightly the common <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi>
which cannot be done before
it be duly prepared for such a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical
dissolution, when it is
dissolved into a Milkie, Silver,
Crystalline Liquor, it will in the
distillation leave some Faeces, in
which remains its more fixt part
or Salt, which thou must warily
and wisely, after a gentle and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical
Calcination, extract and
purifie to the highest Purification,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:49008:66"/>
by which means it will be very
white and clean: then take seven
ounces of the white Mercurial Oyl,
and dissolve in it as much of this
Salt as it will dissolve, until it will
dissolve no more: having so done,
put thy Liquor into a Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Egg, sealing it Hermetically,
and by due degrees of Fire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geal
and fix it: being fixed, it is
the white Medicine, which fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
with Silver, may be cast
upon purged <hi>Venus,</hi> which it will
transmute into most fine Silver:
multiply it with the white Oyl, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
If thou wouldst have it be a red
<hi>Elixir,</hi> put to it some of the red
Oyl, and by requisite degrees of
heat congeal and fix it as before:
ferment it with Gold; multiply it
by the red Oyl, and the aforesaid
white Salt dissolve in it: dissolve
it, congeal and fix it often, until it
will congeal no more, so will it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
an Oyl, which in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
is almost infinite. Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
not to multiply it any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for fear thou losest it; it is
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:49008:67"/>
then so fiery, that it will vanish
out through the Glass reddish, or
Rubie-like. Make projection with
it on what Metal thou wilt, and
thou shalt have most fine Gold,
better than the Natural Gold.

               <head>Tractatus de Lapide, Manna

               <p>IN this Book thou hast a most
faithful and plain Manuduction
to the greatest and most noble Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
of Nature: Enjoy them in si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;
bless God, and do good
unto thy Neighbour and Successor,
as I do hereby to thee, thou finder
of this Book.</p>
               <p>I have resolved with my self to
write this short Treatise, having
been not only an eye-witness, but
also an actor of such high Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of Nature, as the World is not
worthy of, and the Wise of the
World do scarce believe. Which
discourse may be of singular use
to such as God shall please (out
of his infinite mercy) to bestow
the knowledge of this Stone upon,
to make the <hi>Stone of the Wise men</hi>
so called, or the <hi>Philosophers Stone;</hi>
which shall be of much use and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49008:69"/>
benefit to those who are not yet
capable of making the Stone it
self, for it shall illuminate the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of all that read it,
more than all the Books they shall
read: For it shall set down the
Basis and Foundation wherein the
wisdom of all the Philosophers
doth lye, (I except none;) yet
not so as to name that (which no
man durst) in so plain words, that
every fool or lewd fellow may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
it, as he may his <hi>A. B. C.</hi>
when he reads it, for that were to
make my self accurs'd. Whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
thou be that readest this, let
me advise thee rather to fix thy
mind and Soul on God, in keeping
his Commandments, than upon
the love of this Art; which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it be the only, nay all the
wisdom of the World, yet doth it
come short of the Divine wisdom
of the Soul, which is the love of
God in keeping his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Yet let me tell thee, he
that shall have the blessing to
make the Stone, and find this Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:49008:69"/>
he shall see such Mysteries in
Nature, as shall make him of a
wicked, a good man, or else a very
Devil incarnate. But I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
it shall never be permitted
to come to the hands of any but
whom God knoweth fit for it, and
such as shall never abuse it. Hast
thou been covetous, prophane? be
meek and holy, and serve in all
humility thy most glorious Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;
if thou resolve not to do this,
thou dost but wash an <hi>Aethiopia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>
white, and shalt waste an Earthly
Estate, hoping to attain this Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
There is no Humane Art or
Wit can snatch it from the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty's
hand; nor was it ever,
nor I am perswaded ever shall be,
given but to such as shall be of
upright hearts. Remember what
King <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>The fear of the
Lord, is the beginning of wisdom,</hi>
a good understanding have they
that do thereafter: and so if thou
think to attain this wisdom, which
is the top of all wisdom, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
Angelical wisdom, and yet
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:49008:70"/>
dost not fear the Lord, thou dost
give King <hi>David,</hi> and in him the
Holy Spirit the Lye, which be far
from every Christian heart. But
let me conclude my Preface with
this; If God bless thee with the
Stone, and thou have the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this little Script, and dost
make that use of it that here is set
down, thou shalt see that which is
not fit to be written, yet I have set
down in part what thou shalt see
hereafter: as thou shalt read,
pray and study; pray with a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and earnest heart, study with
an honest heart, and leave the
issue to God, to whom be Glory.
<hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The folly of the Students in this
Noble Science and Art, is this;
they set their minds and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
on nothing but making of
Gold and Silver, and so they fall
into this errour, that Gold and
Silver must be the ground-work
of this goodly piece; but that is
false: yet will I not now stand to
disprove it, for that were tedious;
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:49008:70"/>
it is sufficient that I vow upon my
Soul, it is not so, nor any such
matter: yet it is true, that it hath
a true Golden and Metalline Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
But to proceed, briefly know,
that the changing of imperfect
Metals into Gold and Silver, as it
is the chief intent of the Alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists,
so it was scarce any intent
at all of the Ancient Philosophers;
and although it be to be done by
this Art, yet it is but a part, and
indeed the least part of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
that cometh by the Art: yet I
deny not but the possession of Gold
and Silver is a great blessing, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
got in this way, because it
freeth a man from want, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
beholden to others; as also
that a man may do good to others,
to the poor and oppressed; nay it
is a happiness in this World to
possess much, but yet I affirm it
the least happiness that cometh by
the Philosophers Stone, if the full
use thereof be known. Gold and
Silver are goodly things, and the
enjoyment of them very delightful
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:49008:71"/>
to covetous and wicked-minded
men, who do not trust in God, and
know him as they ought; but a
true searcher of this Wisdom, is
content, as the Apostle saith, with
meat, drink, and cloaths, <hi>viz.</hi> a
competency. I have a little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
in my exclamation against
Riches, because I know it befits
not a wise man to love them:
when thou hast read all that I
have set down, thou wilt not value
Wealth, as thou wilt other Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
herein set down and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained;
for by the full knowledge
of it, the whole wisdom of Nature
is to be grasped and embraced;
yea not only infinite Wealth, and
perfect Health, (a far greater
blessing than Wealth) but also the
knowledge of all Animals, Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables,
Minerals, the Radix and
Root of all which, is the true Root
of all Philosophy; nay more, of
all the seven Liberal Sciences,
which in their full perfection are
to be known by the knowledge of
this Art, and without it not one
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:49008:71"/>
can be perfected; nay more, the
artificial making of all precious
Stones, better than the Natural,
and of what greatness you please,
as Rubies, Carbuncles, Diamonds,
Jacinths, Pearls, Topases, Saphirs,
Emeralds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this is not all,
for by the perfection of this Art,
which very few have attained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
all Natural Magick may be
known, all that Spirits can do
(except velocity) may be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by a true Philosopher, though
to ignorant men it seemeth super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural;
all that is natural may
be done by this Art, wicked Spirits
may be commanded and driven
away; in a word, whatever is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary
may be done by it. All
these things were known to <hi>Adam</hi>
in his Innocency, who had this
Art in the highest perfection. This
man, our first Father, was in his
inward parts, or internal man,
made according to the similitude
of God; and to tell the plain
truth, (which when thou hast tryed
what is here set down, thou wilt
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:49008:72"/>
know it to be so) was of the same
Substance and Matter, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
were made of, I mean the
blessed Angels. The Soul of man
is an Angel, and so was called the
Son of God; but for his Body and
Spirit, whence that came, and what
they are, I will set down by and
by that which concerneth that.
Man was the Son of the great
World, or <hi>Macrocosm,</hi> and partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pateth
of all the influences and
virtues of the superiour and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Worlds, yea of all Creatures
good and bad, and that for this
cause, because he was made of that
very Matter and <hi>Chaos</hi> whereof all
the World was made, and all the
Creatures in it: which is a most
high Mystery to understand, and
must, nay is altogether necessary
to be known of him that expecteth
good from this Art, being the
ground of the wisdom thereof.
Foolish men, nay they that the
World holds for great Doctors, say
and tell it for truth, that God
made Man of a piece of Mud, or
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:49008:72"/>
Clay, or Dust of the Earth; which
is false, it was no such Matter, but
a Quintessential Matter which is
called Earth, but is no Earth. The
Fall of Man depraved all things,
yea all the Creatures suffer'd in it,
and himself most of all; for as soon
as he had sinned himself, and his
Wife, his Wife first, both of them
turned into Monsters in respect of
what they were in their Innocency.
<hi>Adam</hi> had another Body before
his Fall, than what he had after;
and so far different, that if we
should behold <hi>Adam</hi> as he was in
his Innocency, we should admire
the glory of him, and tremble at
the sight of him, as at the sight of
an Angel. I say nothing of the
Body of our blessed Saviour, save
only this; such a Body as he
brought from Heaven with him,
such a Body shall we arise with,
and with such Bodies shall our
Souls be endowed with flesh and
bloud; otherwise men should not
differ from Angels, for this flesh
and bloud is put upon us by the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:49008:73"/>
Holy Ghost, that is, by Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
nor doth this cross Sacred
Writ, if it were rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.
I speak nothing likewise of
our blessed Lady, what Body she
had; but when thou shalt have
examined what I shall set down,
then wilt thou find what I say is
true, and understand them in a
plain manner: but I forbear to
speak of those Mysteries, known to
so few; he that liveth according
to the written Word of God, shall
be saved; but he that liveth to be
blessed with this Art, shall glorifie
his Creator, and know him more
than any man can do; but before
the end of the World, all will be
known. But to my former purpose:
Man, the <hi>Microcosm,</hi> or little World,
from the Astres or Stars received
Spirit, from the great World his
Body, and from God immediately
his Soul, so here is an illucidation
of the blessed Trinity; of these
three Man consisteth, of these he is
compounded, thus he had his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
from the World. For what
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:49008:73"/>
concerns his Body, or Humane
part, let us now (as fully as we
may) say something of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of the great World out of
nothing: when there was neither
time nor place, did God create a
certain <hi>Chaos,</hi> invisible, intangi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
which the Philosophers called
<hi>Hyle,</hi> or the most remote Matter;
out of this he made an Extract, or
second Matter or <hi>Chaos,</hi> which the
Philosophers know, not by specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but by sense: that Matter
was and is visible and tangible, in
which were and are all the Seeds
and Forms of all the Creatures,
superiour and inferiour, that ever
were made: from this God divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the four Elements; in a word,
did make all things celestial and
terrestrial, the Angels, Sun, Moon,
and Stars. The knowledge and
practice of the Philosophers upon
this <hi>Chaos,</hi> brought them to the
knowledge of all wisdom, and from
hence (next God) seek thou and
find all wisdom. This is not a
fancy or conceit that I tell thee,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:49008:74"/>
but what I know and have proved;
it is such a thing and substance, as
with the bare knowledge of it,
makes thee know the generation
and preservation of all things, and
yet this <hi>Chaos</hi> is since the Fall
likewise corrupted. Thus briefly
have I discoursed of such things as
perhaps thou dost not believe, or
never heardst of before; but if
thou be'st ordained to know this
Science, I have trod the path for
thee, but I fear thou understandest
me not: yet have I said more than
wisdom would I should, but I know
it shall be to his good only, to
whom God appoints it. My intent
is, for certain reasons that I have,
not to prate too much of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which yet is but only one
thing, already too plainly descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed;
nor of the Preparation, by
what means it is to be done, which
is the second and greatest Secret:
But I have constituted these lines
for the good of him that shall
make the Stone, if it fall into the
hands of such a one; for to him
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:49008:74"/>
it shall shew and set down in plain
terms, as plain as possibly my Pen
can write to the very letter, such
Magical and Natural uses of it, as
many that have had it never knew
nor heard of; and such as when I
beheld them, made my knees to
tremble, and my heart to shake,
and I to stand amazed at the sight
of them. I do therefore charge
thee, whosoever thou be that shalt
be blessed with the enjoyment of
this Treatise, that as thou wilt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
the contrary at the great day,
thou let no man see it, but him
that hath the Stone perfect; for if
thou shalt meet with such a one,
(which is hard to do) and that he
hath brought it to the full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
thou by imparting such
Magical and Physical things, and
other rare Secrets which are here
set down, and by the Stone to be
done, he shall not only give thee
Gold sufficient, but also shall shew
thee the true and right way, and
the Matter with all things belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to it, to make it full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:49008:75"/>
for let me assure thee, I have
known many that have had it, that
never knew more than the bare
transmutation of Metals; and by
the Books of the Philosophers it
appears; that some of them, (nay
more than that) many of them
have kill'd themselves by taking
it; for the want of the knowledge
of the use of it. Never doubt
therefore, but thou shalt obtain
what thou wilt of him that hath
i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, by demonstrating the truth of
what I here write; therefore again
and again I charge thee, not to
part with it, nor to tell any man
of it, although none can make use
of it; but he that hath the Stone
in the highest degree of perfection.
And I will now shew thee the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
uses of it: The first, for Health,
and the manner how to use it; the
second is for Multiplication, which
cannot be done without a Master;
Thirdly, the making of all manner
of precious Stones artificially, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than the Natural; Fourthly,
to turn all Metals into running;
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:49008:75"/>
Quick-silver; Fifthly, several Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
Operations of several kinds,
which are past belief, till thou
seest them, and which indeed are
above all the rest. And here I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
that I will in such plain
words set down what I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
that thou canst not in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
err, or do amiss, provided thou
have the Stone both red and white,
although there be more works out
of it than I dare set down; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
Angelical wisdom is attained

                  <p>IN the use of this Medicine, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
great Philosophers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
after they had obtained this
wonderful blessing, desiring to have
perfect Health, have been so bold
as to take a certain quantity of it,
some no more than a quarter of a
grain, some less, some more, but
all that did so with it; instead of
Health, took Death it self; for
there is no small skill to use it for
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:49008:76"/>
Medicine, though every fool think
if he had it, he could cure all
diseases, and himself too, and set
the Elements at unity, which few
men have known, neither is there
but one way to it with safety; if
this be not known, more hurt than
good may be received by it. For
the method of Health, it is thus:
Take the quantity of four grains,
I do not mean the grains of Wheat,
or Barley grains or corns, but four
grains of Gold weight, and dissolve
them in a pint of White or Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
Wine, but in no hot Wine, as
Sack; <hi>&amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> put it into a great clean
Glass, and instantly it will colour
all the Wine almost as red as it
self was, which is the highest red
in the World: let it stand so, close
covered from dust, four days, for
in respect it is an Oylie substance,
it will not presently dissolve in
Wine; then add to this a pint
more by degrees, until it be not so
red, stirring it with a clean stick
of Wood, not of Metal, nor Glass,
and so continue the pouring on of
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:49008:76"/>
fresh Wine, until it be just of the
colour of Gold, which is a shining
yellow. Beware there be no red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in it; for so long as there is
any redness in it, it is not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
dilated, but will fire the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and exhaust the Spirits: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it sufficiently brought to
yellow, until the Wine have round
about the sides a ring like Hair,
of a whitish film, which will shew
it self plain when well dissolved, if
it stand but four hours quiet. As
soon as you see that whitish film,
then let it run through a clean
linen Cloth, or Paper, so the white
film will stay behind and look like
a Pearl on the Paper, and all the
rest will be yellow like Gold. This
is the token of truth, that you
cannot wrong your self by this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor;
and without this token, it
will be either too weak, or so
strong that it will fire the Body.
Know this to be a rare Secret. Of
this Golden Water, let the party
(of what disease soever he be sick
of) take each morning a good
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:49008:77"/>
large spoonful, and it shall expel
the disease whatsoever it be, by a
gentle sweat; for it purgeth not,
nor vomiteth, nor sweateth so
much as to make faint, but to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborate:
I say, it strengthens the
party; and if the disease be of
many years continuance, or a
Chronical disease, it will then be
perhaps twelve days, otherwise but
twenty four hours, or two or three
days at most. Thus it must be used
for all diseases internal: But for
all external diseases, as Ulcers,
Scabs, Botches, Sores, Fistula's,
<hi>Noli me t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

must be anointed with the Oyl of
the Stone it self, not dilated in
Wine; and after this manner it
must be done nine or ten days, and
be it whatsoever it will, it will cure
all outward and inward diseases.
And more than this, whosoever
carries this Stone about him, no
evil Spirit can or will stay in the
place; nay bringing or giving it
to a party possessed, it drives away
and expels the evil Spirits: for it
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:49008:77"/>
is a Quintessence, and there is no
corruptible thing in it; and where
the Elements are not corrupt, no
Devil can stay or abide, for he is
the corruption of the Elements.

Head anointed with the Oyl of the
Stone each day in the morning, it

And so I proceed to the second,
which is Multiplication.</p>

                  <head>The way to Multiply.</head>
                  <p>MAny have made the Stone
both white and red, that
never knew how to multiply it, for
the white Stone will be red, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
it in the external natural
Fire; but never make projection
higher than one upon ten, neither
white, nor the red: few have
known this, for if they be not
armed rightly, it will kill them;
but do thus, and thou shalt multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
it infinitely, that it shall not
congeal to Powder any more.
When thou hast made the <hi>Mercury</hi>
of the Philosophers, (which in 40
days is to be done) a Water it is,
and no Water, clear as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
then as thou didst make it,
reduce it back again into Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
<hi>E. F.</hi> which it will quickly
do in a Body with a blind Head,
and never put into it above twelve
ounces, and lute it with such lut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
as I will direct here-under, for in
a Glass nipt up it will not work.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:49008:78"/>
When it is like Pitch, take out thy
Glass<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and remove it to a common
fire of Ashes in a Furnace, and
when thy Glass hath stood cold 24
hours, arm thy self thus: Make
thee a Case for thy head and face
with Hog-skin, lined with Cotton,
and before thy face have Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of Glass, and from thy mouth
let go a large Tunnel of Glass, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with Leather, and let it be
tyed under thy Girdle and touch
thy Ancles; let the bore of the
Glass be as big as a Walnut, and
tye the Hyde of Hog-skin fast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
thy Neck under thy Chin,
but so as thou be sure no Air come
in there, to which purpose lap it
over with more Hog-skin, basted
with Laten: and thus art thou
well armed, for otherwise it would
kill thee. Thus armed, take off
thy blind Head, and put on a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilling
Head, and a Receiver long
and large; lute the Receiver and
joynts of the Head with this lute,
<hi>(viz.)</hi> to one ounce of Powder of
Egg-shels, calcined 24 hours, and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:49008:79"/>
ground like Meal, take two ounces
of Enamel, such as the Goldsmiths
use; grind that with the Egg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shels,
and add the white of an Egg
to make it into paste, but the white
must be well beaten first: then
smear this upon Bladders made
supple, and herewith anoint the
joynts of the Receiver three times
double; let it dry 24 hours. Put
thy Glass in Ashes but six fingers
above the Matter thus putrified,
and let the head of the Glass be
very cold, and with a gentle heat
you shall see a white fume arise,
and make all the head of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver
like Milk; increase easily
that Fire, till no more will come,
then let all cool, and these white
fumes settle to a white Water
thickish; this is that white <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi>
to multiply the white Stone:
then put a new Receiver, luted as
before; put in as many Coals as
the Furnace will hold or bear, till
the Pot be red hot, then shall you
see the yellowish fume arise, and
instantly will it increase redder
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:49008:79"/>
and redder. Continue the Fire un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
an Oyl come redder than Bloud
into the Receiver, and it will be
also thickish; this is the red <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi>
wherewith the red Stone must
be multiplied: each of these must
be new rectified, in a new Body
and Head, till they let no Faeces,
which will be in seven times, and
then stop them close with the same
lute till you use them; and when
they are cold, they are white and
red Oyl flowing in the bottom,
which will melt with an easie Fire,
and being cold, be as a Salt: these
are the three principles of <hi>Salt,
Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> a plain Elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidation
of the blessed Trinity. Now
when the white Stone is made, it
will not melt, but is like white
Sand, but impalpable, and will
tinge no Body but <hi>Venus</hi> into <hi>Luna.</hi>
To three parts of the white Stone,
take one part of white <hi>Mercury</hi>
rectified, but first dissolve in that
white <hi>Mercury</hi> one third part of
white Salt; then imbibe the white
Stone, which will presently take it,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:49008:80"/>
and be like Pap; then close your
Egg (for so is your Glass Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plier)
with the aforesaid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ute, and
set it in your first Fire, <hi>H. E. I. E. F.</hi>
and it will in 40 days putrifie, and
pass all the colours, and be white
fixed, and project one part upon an
hundred: repeat that with more
white <hi>Mercury,</hi> as before, keeping
the same proportion and the same
Fire, and it will multiply each time
ten, at the third time it will be a
thousand, then ten thousand, then
a hundred thousand, so you may
bring it to a white Oyl, like the
Moon pale in the dark; then it
will multiply no more, neither will
any Glass hold it. If you make
projection with the white Stone,
then melt fine Silver a tenth part,
then cast in the Stone; keep it
24 hours melting, and this is
Fermentation. The first time the
white goeth only upon <hi>Venus,</hi> the
second time upon all Bodies, the
third time upon common <hi>Mercury,</hi>
and then it is <hi>Elixir</hi> of Spirits. As
you did with the white, so do with
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:49008:80"/>
he red exactly; but take the red
<hi>Mercury,</hi> and white Salt, and so
that goeth one upon ten on <hi>Luna</hi>
the first time, the second upon an
hundred, and so to an infinity;
and so it will be a red Oyl like a
Carbuncle, and will shine in the
darkest night with admirable splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,
and from it will flie all evil
Spirits. And this they must have,
before they cure all diseases, and
give that exaltation to man, to
make such Magical works as I shall
set down.</p>

with those that have the

thine is done: thus shalt thou
know all that have the use of the
Stone. To meet with thy fellow
Philosophers, do thus; anoint thy
temples with the white Stone that
night, and earnesily pray to know
what that party is; lay under thy

remember thy Vision, as the

he will come to thee, for perhaps

be thus, is this; the universal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

this or not to any man, but to him
that hath the Stone. I have now
done, charging thee to have a care

Summary of Philosophy.</head>
               <p>HE that desireth to know
how Metals are transmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
he must know from
what Matter they are, and how
they be formed in their Minerals;
and lest herein we err, we must see
and observe the transmutations as
in the Veins of the Earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
out of the Earth may be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
if they be before spirituali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
that they may come into their
<hi>Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Argent viv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> Nature;
these are the two Sperms, the one
Masculine, the other Feminine
complexions, and these are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of the Elements: the Male
<hi>Sulphur,</hi> is nothing but Fire and
Air; and true <hi>Sulphur</hi> is as a Fire,
but not the Vulgar, which is of no
Metallick substance; the Feminine
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:49008:88"/>
Sperm, called <hi>Argent vive,</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Earth and Water. These
two Sperms, old wise men called
<hi>two Dragons,</hi> or <hi>Serpents,</hi> the one
is winged, the other not; <hi>Sulphur</hi>
not flying the Fire, is without
wings; the winged Serpent, is <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
vive</hi> born up by the Wind,
therefore in her certain hour she
flieth from the Fire, being uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
in it; but if these two
Sperms, separated from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
be united again by trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing
Nature in the Book of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi>
which is the Fire Metalline,
then united it is called of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
<hi>the flying Dragon,</hi> because
the Dragon kindled by his Fire,
while he flieth, by little and little
spreadeth his Fire and poisonous
Vapours into the Air: the same
thing doth <hi>Mercury,</hi> which placed
upon an exteriour Fire, being in
his place in a Vessel, setteth on
fire his inside, which is hidden in
his profundity; and then may any
one see how the external Fire doth
inflame the natural of <hi>Mercury,</hi>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:49008:88"/>
and shall see a poisonous Vapour
to break out into the Air, which
shall be of such a stinking and
pernicious poison, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but the Head of the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,
which speedily went out of
<hi>Babylon.</hi> But other Philosophers
having compared this <hi>Mercury</hi> with
the <hi>flying Lyon,</hi> because a Lyon
devoureth many Creatures, and
recreates himself with his vora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
these things excepted that
resist his violent fury; so also doth
<hi>Mercury,</hi> which hath in himself
such an operation, that it spoileth
a Metal of his form, and devoureth
it: <hi>Mercury</hi> too much inflamed,
devoureth and hideth Metals in
his belly; but which of them so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it be, it's certain it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
in his belly, for in their
Nature they are perfect, and more
than he indurate: but <hi>Mercury</hi>
hath in him a substance of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
<hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Lune,</hi> and all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
Metals come from <hi>Mercury,</hi>
therefore the Ancients called it
the <hi>Mother of Metals;</hi> thence it
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:49008:89"/>
followeth, where he is formed to
any thing, he hath in him a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Metallick substance.</p>
               <p>And first the substance of the
interiour, then of the <hi>Sun,</hi> which
is not like the other Metals; of
these two substances <hi>Mercury</hi> is
formed, which in his Body is spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
nourished: so soon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as Nature hath formed <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi>
of the two mentioned Spirits,
then it laboureth to make them
perfect and corporeal; but when
the Spirits are of growth, and the
two Sperms awakned, then they
desire to assume their own Bodies:
which done, <hi>Mercury</hi> the Mother
must dye, which being thus natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
mortified, cannot quicken itself
again as before.</p>
               <p>Some arrogant Chymists endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
in obscure words to affirm,
that we ought to transmute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and imperfect Bodies into run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<hi>Mercury;</hi> but a Serpent lieth
in the Herbs: its true, that <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi>
may transmute an imperfect
Body, as Lead, or Tin, and may
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:49008:89"/>
without labour multiply in a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
but thereby it loseth its own
perfection, and may no more for
this reason be <hi>Mercury;</hi> but if by
Art it might be mortified, that it
might no more vivifie it self, then
it would be changed into any
thing, as in Cinabar or Sublimate
is done; for when it is by Art co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulated,
whether sooner or later
it be done, then his two Bodies
assume not a fixed Body, neither
are like to conserve it, as we may
see in the pores of the Earth. But
lest any one should err, there are
in the Veins of Lead some fixed
grains of <hi>Sol</hi> or <hi>Lune,</hi> in substance
or nourishment: the first coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of <hi>Mercury,</hi> is the Mine of
Lead, and most fit and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
it is to bring him unto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and fixation; for the Mine
of Lead is not without a fixed
grain of Gold, and which grain
Nature did impart: so in it self it
may be multiplied, whereby it may
come to perfection and plenary
virtue, as I have tried and may
affirm.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:49008:90"/>
Also so long as it is not separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from his Mine, that is, his
<hi>Mercury,</hi> but well kept, for every
Metal that is in his Mine, the same
is a <hi>Mercury,</hi> then may it multiply
it self, so it may have substance
from his <hi>Mercury;</hi> then will it be
like some green immature Fruit
on a Tree, which the Blossom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
past, is made into Fruit, and
then the Apple: but if any should
crop away the immature Fruit;
then his first forming would be
corrupted, because man knows not
how to give substance or maturity,
as internal Nature, while the Fruit
yet hangs on the Tree, and may
have substance and nourishment
from Nature; for so long as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity
is expected, so long the
Fruit draws sap or liquor, and that
by augmentation and nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
till it comes to perfect ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity.
So is it with <hi>Sol,</hi> for if by
Nature a grain be made, and it is
reduced to his <hi>Mercury,</hi> then also
by the same it is daily after an
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> manner sustained and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:49008:90"/>
reduced into his place, <hi>Mercury</hi> as
he is in himself; and then must
you expect till he shall obtain
some substance from his <hi>Mercury,</hi>
as it happens in Fruits of Trees:
for as the <hi>Mercury</hi> of both perfect
and imperfect Bodies is a Tree, so
they can have no more nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
otherwise than from their
own <hi>Mercury:</hi> If therefore thou
wouldst gather from <hi>Mercury</hi> Fruit,
which is shining <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Lune,</hi> if
it be that they be not far dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned,
so that it be without long
delay, then think not you as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
did in the beginning, you
will again conjoyn and multiply,
and may without change aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
them.</p>
               <p>For if Metals be separated from
their Mine, then they (like the
Fruit of Trees too soon gathered)
never come to their perfection; as
Nature and Experience makes it
appear, that if a Pear or Apple be
once plucked from the Tree, it
would then be a great folly, if any
should again fasten it to the Tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:49008:91"/>
and thence expect maturity; for
Experience witnesseth, the more it
is handled, the more it withereth.
And so it is with Metals, for if
any would take Vulgar <hi>Sol</hi> and
<hi>Lune,</hi> and endeavour to reduce
them into <hi>Mercury,</hi> he would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
play the Fool, for no
subtle Art is there to be found,
whereby he might not deceive
him; although many Waters and
Coments, or infinite things of that
kind he should use, he would daily
err, and that would happen to
him, that doth them who would
tye unripe Fruits to their Trees.
Although some Philosophers have
said well and truly, if <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Lune</hi>
by a right <hi>Mercury</hi> be rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned,
that then they will make
all imperfect Metals perfect; yet
in this most men have failed, who
having these three, Vegetables,
Animals and Minerals, which in
one thing are conjoyned; for
they regard not, that Philosophers
speak not of Vulgar <hi>Sol, Lune,</hi> and
<hi>Mercury,</hi> which are all dead, and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:49008:91"/>
receive no more substance from
Nature, but remain in their own
Essence, and can help none other
into perfection: they are Fruits
plucked off from their Trees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their time, and are therefore
of no account, they having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more than what they want.
Therefore seek the Fruit in the
Tree that leadeth you straight un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, whose Fruit is daily made
greater with increase, so long as
the Tree holdeth it forth; and this
work seen, is great joy; by this
means any may transplant this
Tree, without gathering his Fruit,
and then transport him into moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
better, and more fruitful
places, which in one day may give
more nourishment to the Fruit,
than it received otherwise in an
hundred years.</p>
               <p>In this therefore it is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
that <hi>Mercury</hi> the much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
Tree must be taken, who
hath in his power indissolvably <hi>Sol</hi>
and <hi>Lune,</hi> and then transplant him
into another Soyl nearer the <hi>Su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:49008:92"/>
that thence he may gain amicable
utility, in which thing Dew doth
abundantly suffice; for where he
was placed before, he was so
weakned by wind and cold, that
little Fruit was expected from him,
where he long stood and brought
forth no Fruit at all.</p>
               <p>For indeed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Philosophers
have a Garden, where the Sun as
well morning as evening remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
with a most sweet Dew with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ceasing; with which it is sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled
and moistned; whose Earth
bringeth forth Trees and Fruits,
which from thence are planted;
who also receive descent and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment
from the pleasant Meads.
And this is done daily, and there
they be both corroborated and
quickned, and do not fade; and
this more in one year, than in a
thousand where the cold infects
them.</p>
               <p>Take them therefore, and night
and day cherish them in a Stilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ory
upon the Fire; but not with
a Wood Fire, or Coal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>re, but in
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:49008:92"/>
a clear transparent Fire, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
the Sun, which is never hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than is requisite, but should be
always alike; for a Vapour is the
Dew and the Seed of Metals, which
ought not to be altered.</p>
               <p>We see Fruits if they be too hot
with no Dew, they abide on the
boughs without perfection; but if
heat and moderate moisture su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
them on their Trees, then
they prove elegant and fruitful:
for heat and moisture are the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of all Earthly things, Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
Vegetables and Minerals.</p>
               <p>Therefore Coal Fires and Wood
Fires help not Metals; those are
violent Fires, that nourish not as
the heat of the Sun doth, which
also conserveth all corporal things,
because it is natural which they
follow.</p>
               <p>But a Philosopher doth not
what Nature doth, for Nature hath
created all Vegetables, Animals
and Minerals in their own degree,
where Nature reigneth: I will not
say that men, after the same sort,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:49008:93"/>
by Art make Natural things; when
Nature hath finished these things,
then by Humane Art they are
made more perfect. After this sort
old Philosophers, for our informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
laboured with <hi>Lune,</hi> and <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi>
her true Mother, of which
they made the <hi>Mercury of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers,</hi>
which in his operation is
much more strong than Natural
<hi>Mercury;</hi> for this is serviceable
only to the simple, perfect, imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
cold and hot Metals; but the
Philosophers Stone is useful to the
more than perfect and imperfect
Metals. Also that the Sun may
perfect and refresh them, without
diminution, addition or immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as they were created of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
so he leaveth them; neither
doth he neglect any thing. I will
not now say the Philosophers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn
the Tree, for the better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
their <hi>Mercury,</hi> as some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful
of things and unlearned
Chymists do, who take common
<hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Lune</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> and so
ill-favour'dly handle them, till
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:49008:93"/>
they pass away into Smoak: and
they endeavour to make the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
<hi>Mercury,</hi> but they never
attained to that; that is, the first
Matter of the Stone, and the first
<hi>Minera</hi> of the Stone. If they will
come thither, and find any good,
then to the Hill of the seven, where
there is no Plain, they would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
themselves, and from the
highest they have need to look
downwards to the sixt, which they
shall see afar off.</p>
               <p>In the height of this Mountain,
they shall find a Royal Herb tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing,
which some have called
Mineral, some Vegetable and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnal;
but let the Bones be left,
and let a pure clean Broth be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from, and thus the better part
of thy work is done. And this is
the right and subtle <hi>Mercury of the
Philosophers,</hi> and is to be taken of
thee, and first the white work he
will make, and after the red: if
thou have well understood me,
both of them are nothing else, as
they call them, but the Practic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:49008:94"/>
which is so light and so simple,
that a Woman sitting by her Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staff
may perfect it; as if she
would in Winter put her Eggs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a Hen and not wash them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Eggs are put under a Hen
to sit upon without washing them,
and no more labour is required
about them, than that they should
be every day turned, that the
Chickens may be the better and
sooner hatched; to the which
enough and more than enough is
said. But that I may follow the
example, first wash not the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi>
but take it and with its like
which is Fire) place him in the
Ashes, which is Straw, and in one
Glass, which is the Nest, without
any other thing, in a convenient
Alimbeck, which is the House, and
then thence will come forth a
Chicken, which with his Bloud
shall free thee from all Diseases,
and with his Flesh shall nourish
thee, and with his Feathers shall
cloath thee, and keep thee warm
from cold.</p>

have hidden the Secret as much as
we could. But seeing that no man
without this Secret can enter the

make any thing that can profit
him; therefore by the help of the

to reveal unto me this Secret,
I will declare this whole Art with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

that you do not reveal this Secret
unto the wicked, but unto your

not to give it to men, being it is

another, as Water mixt with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
for THUS is pleaseth Nature:
But our <hi>Argent vive</hi> doth enter
and mix it self actually with the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:49008:98"/>
other Vulgar, drying up its fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick
humidity, and taking away
the coldness from the Body, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it black as a Coal, which
afterward it turneth into Powder.
Note therefore, that <hi>Argent vive</hi>
cannot shew forth such Operations,
as our Physical or Natural, which
in all its qualities hath the heat of
Nature, and of true temperature,
and therefore it turneth the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
into its temperate Nature;
nay it doth moreover somewhat
else, for after its transmutation, it
turneth it into pure Metal, that is,
into <hi>Sol</hi> or <hi>Lune,</hi> according as it is
extended; or from <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Lune,</hi>
as is shewed in the second Chapter
or Part of our Practick: Besides
this, it hath somewhat greater, for
it changeth and converteth Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
<hi>Mercury</hi> into Medicine, which
Medicine can transmute the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
Metals into perfect: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
it turneth the Vulgar into
true <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Lune,</hi> better than
those of the Mine. Mark again,
that one ounce of our Vulgar Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:49008:99"/>
                     <hi>Mercury,</hi> can make an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Marks, and so until infinity,
with <hi>Argent vive,</hi> so that the Mine
shall never fail. Besides this, I
will have you know another thing,
that Vulgar <hi>Mercury</hi> is not rightly
nor perfectly mixed with the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
for the Spirit cannot be
mixed with the Bodies perfectly,
unless they be reduced into the
kind of Nature: And therefore
when thou wilt mingle <hi>Lune</hi> and
<hi>Sol</hi> in <hi>Mercury</hi> Vulgar, then these
Bodies must be reduced into the
kind of Nature, which is called
<hi>Argent vive</hi> Vulgar, through the
bond of natural Love, and then
the Male is joyned with the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male;
for our <hi>Argent vive</hi> is hot
and dry actually, <hi>Argent vive</hi>
Vulgar is cold and moist passively,
as a Female which is kept in her
houses with temperate heat until
the <hi>Eclipsis,</hi> and then are made
black as Coals, which is the Secret
of our true Dissolution: after they
are at last truly knit together one
with another, so that they never
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:49008:99"/>
part from one another, and they
become a most white Powder,

            <l>One Friend to another, as
<hi>Bloomfield</hi> suppose,</l>
            <l>The Philosophers Stone the
Secrets doth disclose.</l>
            <p>I Shall tell it to you openly: Our
Medicine is a Stone, that is no
Stone; and it is one thing in kind,
and not divers things, of whom all
Metals be made; and so it is no
Salts, nor Waters, nor Oyl com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustible,
nor mans Hair, nor ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
Bloud, nor Iron, nor Goats horns,
nor Herbs, nor none such things
that discord from Metals, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Fools devise: But he is two
things, for he is Water and Earth;
not Water of Clouds, nor of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosives,
nor Water of Salts, but
Water of the Sun and the Moon,
that burns our Earth more than
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:49008:104"/>
any Fire. And it is three things,
that is, Body, Spirit, and Soul;
and it is four things, Earth, and
Water, and Air, and Fire; and
therefore he is found in every
place, and in every time. And he
is also unstable in colour, as a
shame-fac'd Woman that changeth
her colour for dread of her Love,
that reproveth her of untruth; for
now she is pale, now green, now
red: so our Stone is turned to all
colours, for he is black, and white,
and pale, and blew, and green, and
red; of this Matter our Medicine
is made that we call <hi>Ixir,</hi> and
<hi>Elixir,</hi> that is, the <hi>Philosophers
Stone.</hi> Take this Stone, and put
him in a well-closed clear Vessel,
that thou mayst see his working;
and when thou hast Water of Air,
and Air of Fire, and Fire of Earth,
then it is done, for the Spirit is
departed from the Body, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
the Body dead and black<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
But if the Sepulchre be well closed,
he will come in again to the Body,
and make him rise again to life,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:49008:105"/>
and then the Body and the <hi>Soul</hi>
shall ever be together.</p>
            <p>And therefore take a Red man,
and a White woman, and w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>
them together, and let them go to
Chamber both, and look that the
door and the windows be fast
sparr'd, for else the Woman will
be gone away from her Husband:
And if she lye with him right warm
on Bed, then beware that she go
no where out, for if she do, he
shall never overtake her, if he
were as swift as a Faulcon; for if
she may no where out, she will
come to him again, and lye with
him on Bed; and then she shall
conceive and bear a Son, that shall
worship all his Kin, and then will
she never after go away from her
Husband.</p>
            <p>For this Man and this Woman
getteth our Stone: But the Man
must be fell and quaint to make
her to abide with him with meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and not with sturdiness; for
if he be boisterous to her in the
beginning, she will flee away from
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:49008:105"/>
him, and if he be easie with her in
the beginning, she will he his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
a good while. This is a hard
marriage, nevertheless one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
this is, after that she hath
born a Child, and known some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of disease, she will be the
more sober, and never leave him
after. But shortly, all our working
is no more but take our Stone,
and make him rotten in Horse-dung,
and then seeth him in his
own Water, and afterwards fry
him in his own Grease, and then
roast him till his Grease and his
Water be all dried up, and then

look that thy Fire be easie and soft

Physician to King Charles
the Eighth.</head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>Reverend Doctor, and Honoured Sir,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>WIth the tender of all
possible Respects and
Services be pleased to
understand, that I have received
your very large and copious Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by Mr. <hi>Awdry,</hi> together with
the Stone of your most secret
Work; which truly is a remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
argument of your Friendship,
by which the confidence you put
in me appears manifest and very
great, and with how great and
piercing a Wit also you are illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated.
Now then I shall very
willingly Answer unto your Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle:
Some things I shall approve,
which you have written learnedly
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:49008:109"/>
and ingeniously, other things I
shall briefly touch, and refute
strictly and Philosophically, but
not arrogantly, and throughly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuss
them with submission and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
unto your Honour, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest:
For in this sacred and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Art, as in others, the truth of
the Theory ought to be confirmed
by Practical experience. Now
therefore, Reverend Doctor, let us
visit one another with such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
and Treatises, since we may
not be bodily united. But it is
your wisdom (as you very well
know) to know and inspect thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
by their Causes, for Experience is
deceitful when not guided by a
previous understanding. There is
necessary to the Students in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
a strong and discreet me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,
that the Work they
undertake may be conveniently
brought on to its utmost perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
For contingent errors happen
unto them who will fall to work,
omitting or neglecting the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a mental practice, which
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:49008:109"/>
the Theory frameth in the mind
before the operations proceed to
the composure of any Work: For
Work must attend Nature, and
not Nature follow Work. He then
that would effect any thing, must
prepare his mind with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Natures and eventual
Accidents of things, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
he may safely put his hands
to the Work. And indeed I clearly
perceive your mind to be highly
instructed in these things, by your
Experiment set down fully in your
Epistle: For as Water which is
cold and moist, if it be well mixt
with Vegetables, assumes another
quality, and in decoction takes to
it and puts on it the quality of the
thing wherewith it is throughly
mixt; so also <hi>Quick-silver</hi> assumes
different natures and qualities in
things familiar unto it, and
throughly mixt with it: as if it be
joyned to the <hi>Sun,</hi> the qualities of
the <hi>Sun;</hi> if to the <hi>Moon,</hi> those of
the <hi>Moon;</hi> if to <hi>Venus,</hi> of <hi>Venus:</hi>
and so in other kinds of Metals.
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:49008:110"/>
Their kinds therefore ought to be
decocters therein, and <hi>Mercury</hi> is
their Water, in which by a mutual
alteration it assumes in a conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
manner their mutations. And
this Water contracts unto it self
from them a Nature in a resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
to Vegetables, decocted in
simple Water: though these kinds
are not altered in their colour
outwardly, under the form of flui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
in respect of the thickness of
the Matter and Earth immersed in,
and united proportionably to the
Water of <hi>Mercury;</hi> but we find it
otherwise in other diaphanous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midities:
For this altered, Nature
is altered, and its colour outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is hid under the appearanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of
<hi>Mercury,</hi> and is not manifest to the
sight. And this you at large dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuss
and shew, how simple River
Water is the first Matter and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment
of Vegetables, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
of all living and sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Creatures: therefore if any
of them all be decocted in it, it
assumes and puts on it self the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:49008:110"/>
and propriety of their Nature:
wherefore being in it self cold in
the highest degree, yet by means
of things decocted in it, it works
in us the effect of a thing hot in
the first degree, that I may use
your words. Moreover, there is
nothing that nourisheth more than
the Broth or decoction of good
Flesh; and if the Water in which
Flesh and Herbs are boyled, or the
things boyled in Water, be eaten
moist, or the simple Water a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ter
boyling be taken or drank, it
hurts not at all, yea it will profit
and help much, although before in
its simplicity and nature it would
have been hurtful. Now this comes
to pass because that Water is not
such, as it was before. In lik<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
manner <hi>Quick-silver</hi> is the Matter
of all Metals, and is as it were Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
(in the Analogy betwixt it,
and Vegetables or Animals) and
receives into it the virtue of those
things which in decoction adhere
to it, and are throughly mingled
with it; which being most cold,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:49008:111"/>
may yet in a short time be made
most hot: and in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
with temperate things may be
made temperate, by a most subtl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
artificial invention. And no Meta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
adheres better to it than Gold, as
you say, and therefore as some
think Gold is nothing but <hi>Quick-silver,</hi>
coagulated by the power o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>Sulphur, &amp;c.</hi> And thence you
would conclude, as I think, and
well, that if Gold be decocted and
dissolved rightly in the natural
way of Art, <hi>Quick-silver</hi> it self will
obtain the natural properties of
that Gold. But the way of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction
and solution of Metals, is
known to very few, and it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
appears: for the cause o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
this Solution is the moistness o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>Mercury,</hi> restrained by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pactness
of an Homogeneal Earth;
and contrarywise, the coldness of
the Earth, restrained by a Wate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>omogeneal to it self, the Homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneousness
of qualities remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
So that there is in it a single
dryness, and double coldness, a
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:49008:111"/>
simple moistness, but under a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion
of immaturity to the
anatical proportion of the ripe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
Sun. The dissolver therefore
differs from the dissolvend in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
and digestion, and not in
matter: because Nature might
make this of that, without any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
mixture, as Nature doth
wonderfully and simply produce
Gold of <hi>Quick-silver,</hi> as you have
learnedly discoursed in your Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle.
For in Vegetables, the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
of simple Water is taken
for an intrinsick dissolution, that
things congealed by Art, might
diffuse into it their effects; and the
dissolution of things come about
with the coagulation of Water,
and the coagulation of Water with
the dissolution of things, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarywise:
and so it is likewise in
the Mineral Water, and things of
its kind. He therefore that knows
the Art and Secret of Dissolution,
hath attained the secret point of
Art, which is to mingle throughly
the kinds, and out of Natures to
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:49008:112"/>
extract Natures, which are effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
hid in them. How hath he
then found the truth, who destroys
the moist nature of <hi>Quick-silver?</hi>
as those Fools who deform its kind
from its Metallick disposition or
dissolution, and by dissolving its
radical moisture, corrupt it, and
disproportion <hi>Quick-silver</hi> from its
first Mineral quality, which needs
nothing but purity and simple de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction.
For example, they who
defile it with Salts, Vitriols, and
aluminous things, destroy it, and
change it into some other thing,
than is the nature of <hi>Quick-silver:</hi>
For that Seed which Nature by its
sagacity and clemency o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>osed,
they endeavour to perfect by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
and destroying it, which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
is destructive to it, as
far as concerns the effect of our
Work. For the Seed in humane
and sensitive things, is formed by
Nature, and not by Art, but it is
joyned by Art, and well mixed;
but nothing is to be taken from it,
nor added to it, if the same <hi>specie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:49008:112"/>
must be renovated by the procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of its own kind: so the same
Matter must abide and continue,
that the same Form may follow,
which it doth not otherwise.
Wherefore, excellent Doctor, false
and vain is all their doctrine,
which altereth <hi>Mercury,</hi> which is
the Seed, before the Metallick <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>
be joyned with it: For if it be
dryed up, it dissolves not. What
then can it do in the solution of
things of own <hi>species?</hi> For if it
be heated beyond its natural dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
it will not cause nor gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
in the Metalline <hi>species</hi> a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verish
heat as it were, and will
impertinently turn cold into hot,
and passive into active; and the
errour from thence will be incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible,
and labour lost. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
Fools draw corrosive Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
out of inferiour Minerals, into
which they cast the <hi>species</hi> of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
and corrode them: For they
think that they are therefore dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
with a natural Solution,
which Solution truly requires a
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:49008:113"/>
permanency of the dissolver and
dissolved together, that a new <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>
might result from both the
Masculine and Feminine Seed: I
tell you assuredly, that no Water
dissolves any Metallick <hi>species</hi> by a
natural Solution, save that which
abides with them in matter and
form, and which the Metals them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
being dissolved, can recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geal:
which thing happens not in
<hi>Aquafortis,</hi> but rather is a defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Compound, that is, of
the Body to be dissolved, Neither
is that Water proper for Solutions
of Bodies, which abides not with
them in their Coagulations; and
finally <hi>Mercury</hi> is of this sort, and
not <hi>Aquafortis,</hi> nor that which
Fools imagine to be, a lympid and
diaphanous <hi>Mercurial</hi> Water: For
if they divide or obstruct the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeneity
of <hi>Mercury,</hi> how can
the first proportion of the Femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine
Seed consist and be preserved?
Because <hi>Mercury</hi> cannot receive
Congelation with the dissolved Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
neither will the true kind be
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:49008:113"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>novated afterwards in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
of the Art, nay but
some other filthy and unprofitable
thing. Yet thus they think they
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>issolve, mistaking Nature, but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
not: For the <hi>Aquafortis</hi> being
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>bstracted, the Body becometh
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eltable as before, and that Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
abides not with, nor subsists in
the Body, as its radical moisture.
The Bodies indeed are corroded,
but not dissolved; and by how
much more they are corroded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
they are so much more estranged
from a Metallick kind. These So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
therefore are not the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the Art of Transmuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but the impostures rather of
Soph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>tical Alchymists, who think
that this Sacred Art is hid in them.
They say indeed, that they make
Solutions, but they cannot make
perfect Metallick <hi>species,</hi> because
they do not naturally remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the first proportion or kind,
which <hi>Mercury</hi> the Water allows in
Metallick <hi>species.</hi> For <hi>Mercury</hi> is
corrupted with Metals by way of
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:49008:114"/>
alteration, not dissipation: because
Bodies dissolved therein are never
separated from it, as in <hi>Aquafortis</hi>
and other corrosives, but one kind
puts on and hides another, retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it secretly and perfectly: so
<hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Lune</hi> dissolved, are secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
retained in it. For their nature
is hid in <hi>Mercury,</hi> even unto its
condensation, of which they lying
hid are the cause, in as much as
they are latent in it: and as <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi>
dissolves them, and hides them
in its belly, so they also congeal it,
and what was hard is made soft,
what was soft, hard; and yet the
kind, that is, <hi>Metals</hi> and <hi>Quick-silver,</hi>
abide still. He therefore
who thus dissolves, congeals ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the corrupted <hi>species</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned,
receive their old-form by
an artificial decoction: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
this dissolution makes se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
colours appear, because the
<hi>species</hi> remain as it were dead, yet
their intrinsical proportion is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent
and entire. So the Lord in
the Gospel speaks by way of simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:49008:114"/>
of Vegetables, <hi>Unless a grain
of corn fallen on the earth do dye,
it abides alone; but if it dye, it
brings forth much fruit:</hi> Therefore
this alterative corruption hides
forms, perfects natures, keeps pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions,
and changes colours from
the beginning to the end: For
when the Water begins to cover
the Earth, the black colour begins
to be hid under the white; when
the Air covers the Water and the
Earth, the citrine colour appears;
which is turned to red, when the
Fire covers the Air, or the other
three Elements. And these last co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
abide hiddenly and intrinsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,
and appear under the shew
of a white Spirit in liquid <hi>Mercury,</hi>
until it be recondensed in the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which is in the Bodies: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Soul lies hid in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
as in the condensation the
Spirit and the Soul lie hid in the
Powder or Body. For there is a
corruption in the things to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
but no dissipation of parts,
unless some superfluous parts be
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:49008:115"/>
to be rejected as unprofitable for
generation, whereupon the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer
purifies his Work, that dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
may succeed better. This is
manifest by example in Grain, for
of two grains of Wheat, if the one
be cast into good ground, there it
putrifies, dies, and loses its exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
form, but nothing thereof is
dissipated, yea in its time it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creases
into a multiplicity of Fruit,
and there is indeed made a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
only of the form, and not
any dissipation of the matter: But
if the other grain be cast into the
Fire, then both matter and form
are corrupted, and the whole is
dissipated, and that corruption
is unprofitable for generation.
Wherefore Water dissolves not Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
but those only of its own
kind, and by which it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
nor can Bodies be at all
nourished to generation, but by
their like, which can preserve the
<hi>species</hi> destroyed by that transmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Body, through the artifice of
the Work: though Vegetables are
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:49008:115"/>
nourished by things of different
kinds, yet before they nourish
them, they are assimilated (the
dissolution of them being first
made) according to the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the things which suck and
draw them to them. It must be
noted therefore, that the Solution
of Metals may be made by diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
ways: one, which Fools know,
as is abovesaid, with Foreign
things, which abide not with the
dissolved Metals, which is rather
to be called a corrosive destruction
and defilement of the Compound.
The second Solution is made by
the power and force of Fire, which
is no true Solution, but a melting
rather of the colligated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
parts: for the outward heat
of the Fire, in dissolving the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound,
finds out its intrinsical, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
or native Fire within, which
internal and proportional Fire
dwells in the Air, therefore it dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves
the Air it self. But that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
Air resides and dwells in the
Water, and the Water in the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:49008:116"/>
Earth, and the Water it self dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves
the Earth, so that it melts
both the active and passive; but
this melting is no true Solution,
yea it is a dissipation, because the
Elements there being homogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to one another, and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably
fixed, by digestion are
mixt, and one of them educed out
of the power of another generally:
And therefore this falls out even
in pure Bodies, in which the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
natures are fixed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in them the flame of Fire
causeth melting, and dissolves that
whole Body to fluidity, and not to
a separation; because Fire cannot
flow, unless the Air consubstantial
to it flow; neither doth the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
flow, unless the Water be dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
nor doth the Water flow, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
the Earth flow: and contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
as the Earth is dissolved by
the Water, so on the contrary side
the Water retaineth the Air, and
congealeth it: and in the same
manner ascending upwards, the
Air retaineth the Fire in Congela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:49008:116"/>
because the more fixt and
fixing Elements cause fixation, by
acting together on one another;
as Earth and Water, and in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
manner Fire and Air, act to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
each on other unto Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But this Solution is called a
melting of the Compound, and not
properly a Solution of it, because
the parts separable from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the generation of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound,
are not dissolved, as is done
in the third and truly Philosophick
Solution, when the Compound is
dissolved in the manner aforesaid,
and yet the parts abide unsepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
though separable; so that the
virtue of the most digested Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
may be extracted from
things to be dissolved by the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solver,
that is, <hi>Quick-silver,</hi> and
the grosser parts in such a dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
acquire some latitude of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty,
because the Body is turned
into Spirit, and contrariwise the
Spirit into Body; fixed things are
turned into volatiles, and volatiles
to fixed. For this Solution is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:49008:117"/>
and natural, that is, by Art of
Nature subserving thereto; and
this is sole and necessary Solution,
in the Work of the Philosophers,
which can be done by no other
thing than <hi>Quick-silver</hi> only, with
a prudent proportion: so as a good
Artificer knowing from within the
natures and proportions, ought to
make the proportion from his first
entrance upon the Work. For
these two, Sir, are sufficient for
this Work, and nothing else enters
it, nor generates and multiplies,
as we have said. Besides, you say
that Gold, as most think, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else than <hi>Quick-silver</hi> coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated
naturally by the force of
<hi>Sulphur;</hi> yet so, that nothing o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
the <hi>Sulphur</hi> which generated the
Gold, doth remain in the substance
of the Gold: as in an humane <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryo,</hi>
when it is conceived in the
Womb, there remains nothing of
the Father's Seed, according to
<hi>Aristotle</hi>'s opinion, but the Seed of
the Man doth only coagulate the

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:49008:117"/>
in the same manner you say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that
after <hi>Quick-silver</hi> is so coagulated,
the form of Gold is perfected in it,
by virtue of the Heavenly Bodies,
and especially of the Sun. But by
your good leave, and with respect
I must tell you, we must not think
so: For being we are Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
perswaded, that Gold is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but <hi>Mercury</hi> anatized, that
is, equally digested in the bowels
of a Mineral Earth; and the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
have signified, that this
very thing is done by the contact
of <hi>Sulphur</hi> coagulating the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi>
and by reason of its opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that is, from <hi>Mercury</hi> being
digested and thickned by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate
heat. Wherefore we
must know, that Gold is <hi>Sulphur</hi>
and <hi>Mercury</hi> together, that is, the
coagulant and the coagulated in
one: and nothing added from
without thereto, but only a pure
digestion or maturation, which
multiplies qualities, and excites
one Element from another out of
their pure possibility into act, no
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:49008:118"/>
other thing whatsoever being su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradded.
But this digestion or
matutarion is produced actively,
from the superiour Elements, that
is, the Fire and Air, which are not
actually but potentially in <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury;</hi>
which yet being excited and
assisted by an external heat, and
by the proper and natural digest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
heat, the passive Elements in
<hi>Mercury</hi> are by them subtilized,
being not only potentially existent,
but actually, towards Water it self,
and the Water is subtilized to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Air, and Air follows to Fire;
and in this proportionable action
of Nature, and digestion of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi>
the Male and Femal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

together in closed Natures; the
Female truly as it were Earth and
Water, the Male as Air and Fire:
which Earth and Water the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers
do mingle in Gold, but
called the Air and Fire a <hi>Sulphur</hi>
as it were therein: neither is there
any other Foreign addition in the
bowels of the Earth. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in Art above ground neither
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:49008:118"/>
is there found and Foreign addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to digest or condense <hi>Mercury</hi>
into the nature of Gold, or other
<hi>species</hi> of Metals. Therefore the
Philosophers have said, that <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi>
and <hi>Mercury</hi> make <hi>Sol,</hi> that is,
its corporeity and permanency:
And therefore it is not hence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
that the external artificial
heat, stirring up and assisting the
proportional intrinsick heat, to
digest and ripen the other two less
digested and immature Elements
in <hi>Mercury,</hi> namely its Water and
Earth, is of the substance of the
Compound. For the external heat
is not permanent within, with the
quantity and weight of the Matter,
nor adds any thing thereto: But
the intrinsick proportionate natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and simple heat is permanent,
with the quantity and weight of
the <hi>Mercury</hi> digested by it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that heat is an intrinsick
and essential part of <hi>Mercury</hi> it
self, to wit, the two more active
Elements in it, namely Air and
Fire. Therefore Fools do ill and
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:49008:119"/>
absurdly understand that saying of
the Philosophers, that <hi>Sulphur</hi> and
<hi>Mercury</hi> beget <hi>Sol;</hi> because, as is
sufficiently known, as neither Air
nor Fire in the first <hi>Mercurial</hi>
composition, nor afterwards in the
natural Metallick digestion, depart
nor are severed from Water and
Earth, so neither doth <hi>Sulphur</hi>
(which is no other than Air and
Fire) depart nor is separated from
<hi>Mercury,</hi> which is the same with
Water and Earth. And he is not a
natural Philosopher who imagines
or asserts the contrary: for the
digestion of Gold happens and is
made of the first <hi>Mercurial</hi> propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
without any addition made
thereto by Nature under, or Art
above ground, as is said. Neither
is that repugnant to what we have
said, that a pure <hi>Sol</hi> and clean
<hi>Mercury</hi> must in this Art be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned,
because this is not done to
that intent to affirm, that there is
one <hi>Sulphur</hi> in <hi>Sol,</hi> and another in
<hi>Mercury,</hi> or that there is one <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi>
in <hi>Sol,</hi> and another in <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:49008:119"/>
but because the digestion is
more mature and perfect in <hi>Sol,</hi>
than <hi>Mercury.</hi> And also in the Sun
the <hi>Sulphur</hi> is more mature and
digested, and therefore more active
than in <hi>Mercury:</hi> whence the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
have affirmed <hi>Sol</hi> to be
nothing else but <hi>Quick-silver</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
For in <hi>Mercury</hi> there are
only two actual Elements, to wit,
Water and Earth, which are pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive;
but the active Elements, Air
and Fire, are only potentially
therein. But (as it is known) when
those Air and Fire in a pure <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi>
are deduced from possibility
into act, that is, to a due digestion
and proportionable concoction,
then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t becomes Gold. Wherefore
in Gold there are four Elements
conjoyned in equal and anatical
proportion, in which therefore
there is actually a more ripe and
active <hi>Sulphur,</hi> that is, Air and
Fire, than in <hi>Mercury:</hi> Wherefore
Gold is by Art dissolved with <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi>
that the unripe may be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
by the ripe, and so Art de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocting,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:49008:120"/>
and Nature perfecting,
the Composition is ripened by the
favour of Christ. Whence the cause
may be derived, why by the help
of the Philosophick Art, more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
noble, and by many degrees
more elevated Gold is made, sooner
and in less time, than by the work
of Nature. Because Nature doth
act and work this by boyling and
digesting <hi>Mercury</hi> alone in the
bowels of the Earth, without any
assistant: which cannot be brought
on to the due proportion of Gold,
or any other Metal, in a little
time. But our Art helps the work
of Nature, by mingling with <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi>
ripe Gold, in which is a <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi>
excellently digested, and
therefore maturing and quickly
digesting <hi>Mercury</hi> it self, to the
anatick proportion of Gold, by
subtilizing its Elements: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
there follows by Art a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
abbreviation of this natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Work. Wherefore, my Doctor,
I return to the former points; we
must not imagine, according to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:49008:120"/>
their mistake, who say, that the
Male Agent himself approaches
the Female in the coagulation, and
departs afterwards; because, as is
known in every generation, the
conception is active and passive:
Both the active and passive, that is,
all the four Elements, must always
abide together, otherwise there
would be no mixture, and the hope
of generating an off-spring would
be extinguished. For in every
man, the Masculine Seed to the
end of his life is called in him the
Agent, when it is first mingled
with the Feminine; and whether
it be shed out, or consumed in
him, Nature for its sake doth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getate,
and is wonderfully increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and nourished, and makes to
it self in the same mans loins the
like specifick Seed. The like is to
be judged of the Feminine Seed in
the Women; wherefore both these
Seeds abide always, and are to be
esteemed for original Agents, and
first Patients. Yet there is a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
or different nativity or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:49008:121"/>
of Mixts and Vegetables:
For they are called Simple Mixts,
which grow under ground, out of
our sight, or about the surface
thereof, by the commixture of the
Elements alone compounded one
with another: or from their first
Solution; because they grow not
as Vegetables, but how much so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
of matter was compact and
mixt in them, so much of their first
weight is reserved in the same
Compounds. For example sake:
how much soever at first a mass of
some <hi>Mercurial</hi> substance doth
weigh in its Mineral disposition in
the bowels of the Earth, so much
weight of Gold will abide digested
therefrom: and the <hi>Scoriae</hi> and
<hi>Faeces</hi> rejected from it, will rather
be diminished than multiplied, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they receive no nourishment.
But there are manifold degrees of
this first and simple natural mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
The first is, the naked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
and composition of the
four Elements, and that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate,
in which there is not yet any
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:49008:121"/>
change made, or exaltation of one
Element into another: but a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
union of a symbolizing compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of them, persevering and
abiding; of which sort Stones are.
The second degree follows upon
the first, because from the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
Stones, Minerals<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (about which
we discourse) are generated, and
the more noble subterraneous <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>
emerge and arise from hence:
because in these begin the action
of Elements, and their mutual
transmutation, though their action
is not in so great vivacity and
virtue as in Vegetables and Sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
because they have neither
growth nor sense, as we have
said before. The third degree is
that which comprehends precious
Stones and Gems, because in them
is found a perfect and compleat
action, from the virtue of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
compacted and acting mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually,
as I have declared more
largely in my <hi>Philosophy:</hi> where
I have perspicuously manifested
this third degree, together with
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:49008:122"/>
the second, to be a mean betwixt
the first and second composition of
Natural things. Then another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity
or generation is that which
is not accounted to be of Simple
Mixts, but Compound Vegetables:
which are truly divisible into four
kinds, or Classes, as I have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed
more largely in my other
Book which I sent you. For there
are Vegetables, but Sensitives
more especially, which for the
most part beget their like, by the
Seeds of the Male and Female for
the most part concurring and
commixt by copulation; which
work of Nature the Philosophick
Art imitates in the generation of
Gold. No man can artificially
perfect any humane Seed, but we
can by Art dispose a man to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive
generation of his like:
For the vital Seeds are only dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
in a vegetable manner by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
in the loins of both Parents;
but we can by coition mix the
Parents Seeds in natural Vessels,
which copulation is as it were an
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:49008:122"/>
Art disposing and mingling those
natural Seeds, to the begetting of
Man. For example sake; the Seed
of the Man, as more ripe, perfect
and active, is by this artifice
joyned with the Seed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
more immature and in a sort
passive; which Seed of the Man,
because it actually contains in it
the working Elements, to wit, the
Air and Fire, is therefore more
ripe and active for digestion. But
the Female Seed doth more actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
contain the undigested and
passive Elements, and which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are to be digested, as the
Earth and Water, which being
shed out and mingled together in
the natural Vessels of the Female,
no Foreign thing being added
thereto, (but the external heat of
the Woman exciting and helping
the proportionable inward heat of
the Mans Seed) the active Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Mans Seed, digest
and ripen the Feminine Seed, and
thence a Man is generated, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
and perfect according to his
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:49008:123"/>
Nature. So it is in our Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick
Art, which is like this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation
of Man; for a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in <hi>Mercury</hi>
(of which Gold is by Nature ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
in Mineral<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Vessels) a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
conjunction is made of both
the Seeds, Male and Female, so by
our artifice, an artificial and like
conjunction is made of Agents and
Patients. For the active Elements
which obtain the name of the
Masculine Seed, are naturally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
with the passive Elements,
which are as it were the Feminine
Seed; but herein the due natural
proportion is always to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
Now this first <hi>Mercurial</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion
is called Conjunction, in
which the act riseth out of the
possibility, that is, the Masculine
from the Feminine, namely the Air
and Fire, from the Earth and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
by means of a pure digestion
and subtilization of them. But
the Philosophers and ingenious Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers
imitating Nature, besides
this natural digestion of the Seeds
in <hi>Mercury,</hi> have by a most subtle
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:49008:123"/>
invention made another conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and digestion, whence they
have not generated simple Gold
only, but some other far more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and perfect thing. For they
commanded Gold (in which the
Elements are more active) as the
Male Seed, to be joyned with <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi>
(in which the passive Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are existent) that it might
be duly dissolved, excluding all
Foreign things, save that they used
an outward heat, which by help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
doth excite the internal natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
heat of Gold, to digest actively
and ripen <hi>Mercury.</hi> And so as a
Man is generate by Nature, so
Gold by Art: Although notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
their Sperm and Seed
cannot be generated by Art, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Art knows not proportion of
the mixture necessary to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create
Seed; and in Man it knows
neither composition, nor mixtion
or first proportion, nor the causes
of subterraneous things, which flow
out from the Earth, where is the
proper and natural place of their
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:49008:124"/>
generation. But those Seeds pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by Nature are artificially
conjoyned, that out of them in a
way of composition, that which is
to be generated may be produced,
in which both the Seeds abide to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
well mingled, although
<hi>Aristotle,</hi> as you write, seem to
think otherwise. Wherefore the
Masculine Seed of <hi>Mercury,</hi> or our
<hi>Sulph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r,</hi> goes not away after coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation,
as some falsly affirm;
and that this falls out in <hi>Mercury,</hi>
by the force of the Sun especially,
and that by its heat chiefly the
form of Gold is perfected, as some
think in subterraneous places:
Yea rather by the force of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of its Globe, or of its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>b,
and of the whole Heaven univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally,
because the <hi>Solar</hi> Rays do
only heat the surface of the Earth,
and not inwardly those its deep
places, in which the generation of
several kinds of Metals is brought
about; and neither do the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of Heaven, brought down by
the Rays, reach unto those lower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:49008:124"/>
parts, although the subterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
motion of the Elements pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
first from the motion of the
Heavens, and not from its Rays of
light, nor from their heat, nor
other influence save motion: but
how this comes about, and what
is the cause of this motion of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous
things, I believe your
Reverence is not ignorant, and
therefore I forbear it at present.
Therefore the Sun is not the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
cause of Gold, or of its form,
though there be a resemblance in
names betwixt them; because as
the Sun is hotter than the rest of
the Planets, so Gold is hotter than
any of the Metals, with the like
difference of proprieties. The rest
of the Planets also have obtained
like names, whence this errour of
Fools doth arise: For they believe
that every one of the seven Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
generally and specially by its
influence doth beget one special
kind of Metal, whereunto by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
propriety it agrees, and is in
its nature resembled. But it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:49008:125"/>
otherwise in subterraneous
things, than in Vegetables, in
which Heaven or the Sun is the
cause of their generation or aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation,
not only<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by its motion,
but also by reason of the heat of
its Rays: For the Sun heats the
Vegetables themselves, and the
superficies of the Earth, the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
being very strongly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
by its Rays to the surface
of the Earth, because that its Rays
can proceed so far. To instance:
for that from the twelfth Heaven
which obtains the utmost degree
of height, proceeding to descend
lower, there follow always thicker
or less subtle Orbs, till you come
to the concave of the Orb of the
Moon, where alterable things have
their place, or the mixt Elements
begin, and are terminated under
the Hemisphere of things genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and corruptible. And therefore
the more subtle and simple Fire is
there found, though not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pure: because a simple pure
Fire cannot be found apart amongst,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:49008:125"/>
the alterable sorts of things, nor
any one of the other Elements,
albeit in every Compound thing
simple Fire may be found, mixed
with other simple Elements, else
there would not be many Elements,
but one only. Therefore the Rays
of the Stars of Heaven, of the Sun
especially, pass through the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
Regions unrefracted, until
they descending farther down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
are reflected in the Fire by
reason of its thickness; afterwards
descending farther through the
Sphere of the Fire, they by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it reflect the Fire it self into
the Air which is thicker. And in
like manner the Rays proceeding
perpendicularly to lower things,
through the Sphere of Air, into
the Water thicker than the Air,
from which they are reflected back
into the Air. And so after its man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
they are reflected back by the
Water moved by them, which also
is much better perceived in the
Earth, with its thickness above
other Elements. By this decoction
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:49008:126"/>
and reflection the Elements are
moved invisibly, though not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceivably:
because we perceive
heat by the motion of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
and it is always reflected
from the superiour and subtles
Element, into the inferiour and
thicker, unto the surface of the
Earth, by means of the Rays of the
Stars descending perpendicularly
from aloft to the lowest things;
and things thus reflected being
moved, and by the Rays of the
Sun reflected, accidental heat is
produced in the <hi>medium,</hi> though
sometimes by the Rays of other
Stars, other qualities are produced
here below, as dryness and cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
as is manifest in Astronomy;
not that the Rays are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
hot, but that they are the
cause of heat in such manner as
we have said. Now that these
things are true, is manifestly
known from Astronomy and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective,
whence it is understood
how generations happen in Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives
and Sensitives, thus much
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:49008:126"/>
therefore may suffice. But vain
Astrologers have other conceits,
and think that the influences of
Heaven are from the virtue of its
activity, and not from the virtue
of its motion: which is false, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Rays of Heaven produce
or effect nothing in the superiour
Orbs. For such Rays cannot be
reflected on the aforesaid Orbs,
nor be mixed with them, as they
are reflected in the Elements and
mingled with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not by compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
but by a moving reflection
and mixture of the same Elements,
as hath been said: but in the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percelestials
there is no capacity
to receive new qualities, or Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
impression, although the
Rays themselves produce wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
qualities in the Elements, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by their reflection. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
my Doctor, the Sun in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
is not the cause of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
of Gold, nor yet is it by
means of its heat the cause of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables
either above the Earth,
or of Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which namely we know to be
heated by the Rays of the Sun, as
we have said, which is also agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to Astronomy. But the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of these things, need not
any longer disputation, wherefore
I pass on to what remains; for if
you apply your mind to those
things which we have said, you
will understand and you will find
it true, that by the activity of <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi>
digesting and coagulating
<hi>Mercury,</hi> its form from Gold is
specially perfected: but yet you
must not think that from any other
Metal, or any Star; this may be
done, as you have written in your

is also to be understood of othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but with difference, because in

One which is superfluous,
and may be separated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the form of

of the Metal, but united to its

as in Gold and Silver, a simple
and single <hi>Sulphur;</hi> which is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Quick-silver,</hi> from the first
<hi>Mercurial</hi> composition, as hath
been declared in the generation
of Gold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Because <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:49008:128"/>
                  <hi>Quick silver</hi> are nothing else but
the four Elements in <hi>Mercury</hi> it
self, so or so proportionally dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
as this or that Metallick
<hi>species</hi> requireth. But that which
is reputed a second <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and
to be rejected, is a certain <hi>Scoria</hi>
and faeculent part in the Metals,
contracted in the coagulation of
the <hi>Mercury;</hi> or a certain super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity,
which being unclean and
impure, would not in the dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
of the <hi>Mercury,</hi> endure a
congelation to the form of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal:
because it was not of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeneal
and proportionable Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of <hi>Mercury,</hi> apt to be congea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and digested into a Metal. But
some Philosophers have called this
<hi>Scoria,</hi> a combustible <hi>Sulphur,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it cannot subsist, but vanish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in the testing of Metals, or is
separated from them into Faeces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And here I may bring this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
the bloud in Sensitives, and
sap in Vegetables, in their coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
have several and different
offices; because some parts of the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:49008:128"/>
bloud have a conformity unto
Flesh, and therefore may be coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated
and turned into Flesh, and
retain the uniform nature of Flesh,
and obtain the name of Flesh. But
some parts thereof residing in the
pores, are of a superfluous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
which can in no wise be
converted into solid Flesh, and
therefore are ejected by Sweat and
Medicines, and separated from the
true Flesh. But in the Sanguine
complexion there are many fewer
superfluities, than in others: So we
may conclude by way of resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance,
that it is in Gold and
other kinds of Metals; that the
purer or impurer <hi>Mercury,</hi> in its
first coagulation, contained or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
more or less superfluities,
or natural impurities. Wherefore
the difference is made in the coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation
of <hi>Mercury,</hi> which speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
and causes divers Metals; and
whatever <hi>Mercury</hi> there is in any
sort of Metal, is termed incombu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stible,
and inseparably permanent,
though in fixed Bodies it is made
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:49008:129"/>
volatile by Art, yet by Nature it
remains inseparable in an Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
proportion. But what dross so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
was contracted in the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi>
and mixed with it from the
beginning; (that is, in the conge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of <hi>Mercury</hi> in its first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
by heat digesting it to a
Metallick kind; and therefore it is
by the test taken away from the
<hi>Mercury,</hi> that is, the homogeneous
<hi>Mercurial</hi> nature, and separated
from the Metallick kind as rejecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
and heterogeneal) this is
not properly called a <hi>Sulphur,</hi> but
a dross and certain superfluity:
because <hi>Sulphur</hi> is nothing else but
a pure act of Air and Fire, warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and digesting, or decocting,
the Earth and Water in <hi>Mercury,</hi>
proportionable and homogeneous
unto it. But the dross is that
which in the first composition was
not pertinent unto the nature of
<hi>Mercury,</hi> nor had a proportion to
any Metallick kind in the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
and digestion of the first
Elements in <hi>Mercury.</hi> From these
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:49008:129"/>
things it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is known, that there are
not in other sorts of Metals any
distinct or more <hi>Sulphurs,</hi> than are
in Gold and Silver, but one only
and simple <hi>Sulphur;</hi> though there
are in them more and greater su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities,
than are in Gold. From
hence the truth of your saying is
known, that Gold, of all Metals,
cleaves most unto <hi>Mercury.</hi> Now
this comes to pass by reason of the
purity of both, because in them is
less dross, dregs, or superfluity,
than in others: For every thing
doth naturally desire, by a
through mixture and union, to be
joyned to a thing of like nature to
it, and proportionable in homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneity,
rather than with a thing
unequal and unlike to it, as we
know; like as Water very easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and without contradiction is
quickly joyned to another Water,
with an identative and uniting
mixture. Now in Gold there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but <hi>Mercury,</hi> therefore being
there is in it little dross, (which
is not of a <hi>Mercurial</hi> nature, as we
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:49008:130"/>
have shewed) there is therein no
great resistance, but that a pure
<hi>Mercury</hi> may more easily adhere to
Gold and Silver, than to other
Metals, in which many superflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and dross do forbid and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
other Metals, or their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed
<hi>Mercury,</hi> any contact, or
through mingling with crude <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury.</hi>
For those superfluities, as we
have already said, are not of the
first composition of <hi>Mercury,</hi> nor of
the same natural or proportional
homogeneity: and if happily they
be of its composition, yet they are
not of its proportion; for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is of any things proportion,
is not superfluous. Wherefore they
cannot be inseparably throughly
mingled, neither with <hi>Mercury</hi> to
be coagulated by Art, nor with
<hi>Mercury</hi> coagulated, which in the
nature of its Mineralness is joyned
with them in the same kind of
Metal; being such dross is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustible
by Fire, and therefore se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable.
What wonder is it then
if in those Metals to which they
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:49008:130"/>
are accidentally superadded, they
hinder their natural commixtion
and permanent union with coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<hi>Mercury,</hi> or other crude <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury?</hi>
For this very cause Gold it
self, though never so pure, can far
more difficultly abide with, be
joyned and adhere to an unclean
and drossie <hi>Mercury,</hi> coagulated or
not coagulated, than with a pure
and clean one. Because a simple
Nature doth rejoyce in the society
of, and is perfected by a simple
Nature, that is like to it, and same
with it in its first homogeneity and
Elemental proportion: but Gold,
as hath been said, is nothing else
but <hi>Mercury</hi> thickned by its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
digestion, and Elemental acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
therefore albeit in the Earth
there be a difference betwixt Gold
and <hi>Mercury</hi> in ripeness, (because
Gold is more ripe than <hi>Mercury)</hi>
yet there is no diversity in their
Matter. Therefore whatsoever Gold
hath acquired by the digestion it
hath unto maturity, <hi>Mercury</hi> may
acquire the same without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traneous
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:49008:131"/>
thing. But Art to bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate
and contract the Work, joyns
Gold with <hi>Mercury,</hi> as is said, and
out of two Sperms it makes and
generates artificially that same
thing, which Nature doth create
in the Mines of one actual Seed,
the identity of the Matter being
always everywhere observed, but
not the same active power. And
therefore as nothing extraneous to
its Nature, doth enter this Work
in its first composition, so neither
doth any thing multiply it, which
is not of the first temperament
thereof. Wherefore some men
think falsly, that the Philosophers
Stone may be composed of divers
things, or of all things, and be
nourished by them, instead of the
aforesaid Sperms, notwithstanding
divers names have been imposed
on them. Neither doth his Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophick
Work eat any thing, or
convert it into its own Nature,
which is extraneous, because it
doth not vegetate. Wherefore
though there be in the said Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophick
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:49008:131"/>
Stone, a Body and a Soul,
or a Spirit, it is not therefore ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getably
animated as Trees and
Plants: For this Stone, as all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals,
is of the aforesaid first,
and not of the second, or any su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
intention or imposition.
But Trees and Plants are of the
second imposition, as Vegetables
are of the third, fourth, fifth, or
last imposition, for mixt things in
those four last impositions, do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getate.
For in them the Elements
by many transmutations, and by
being oftner alterated, are more
subtle; wherefore they are more
active and perfect, though they are
not more durable and permanent
in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>heir permixtion, because the
Elements in them are not of a
fixt, but dissolvable composition;
wherefore they take in their nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment
vegetably. But our Stone,
as also all the Minerals, is of the
first imposition; because it vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
not, nor is vegetably nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished,
but nourishment befalls it
rather by apposition of a nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:49008:132"/>
of a like nature to it, and
not by vegetation. For example
sake: because, as is manifest by
experience, out of a Feminine Seed,
to wit, out of <hi>Mercury</hi> put to it
unitively, insensibly and by way
of composition this Philosophers
Stone is nourished, but by means
of a digestive heat. For it takes
and assimilates its like unto it self,
to be multiplied by way of apposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and not vegetably; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it becomes weightier in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
and more active and perfect
in quality: neither doth Fire or
heat multiply this our Stone, as its
due nourishment, because it is not
of its first composition, but heats
it by an extrinsical accident: For
how can Flame or Fire multiply
the Stone it self, or make it of it
self more weighty, when it cannot
be fixedly and permanently min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
with it, nor is not of its first
composition or form? Nothing
therefore nourishes and multiplies
the said Stone, to the generation
of the same form, except the Femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:49008:132"/>
Seed, which nourisheth it by
means of heat, and nourishes it
not vegetably, but by way of
apposition and commixtion. He
therefore who thus multiplies and
nourisheth it, shall not erre, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this multiplier and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risher
is turned into the same kind.
A man may indeed increase the
Stone and its weight by extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
things; but this must be
done out of its natural kind, not
convertible into it: For that
weight would be made besides Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that is, not into the same
<hi>species,</hi> nor into the unity of one
<hi>species,</hi> yea it would be an aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of divers kinds, and an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental
composition, which might
be separated by the Test. But
when the Philosophers said, that
the Stone might be made of every
thing, truly they understood it
not, (as some perversly interpret
them) that the Stone might be
made of divers things, unlike unto
it both in kind and nature; or,
which is more absurd, that it
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:49008:133"/>
might be multiplied by a Flame
ministred to it from without: for
this reason especially, because Fire
and its Flame may by a certain
production arise out of every
thing: Now the refutation of this
opinion is manifest from what hath
been said before. But when the
Philosophers say, that the Stone is
made of every thing, they mean,
that it is made of the four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
proportionally equalized to
one another by a due and natural
digestion; out of which four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
every thing that is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and corruptible is made.
Therefore by this similitude the
Philosophers say our Stone is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>de
out of every thing, that is, out of
every Element; because if any one
of them were mortified or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed,
the whole proportion of
the Golden Nature would perish,
and its kind: and every thing in
whatsoever latitude and sort of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terables,
is generated out of the
four Elements either actually, or
potentially mixt: yet it cannot be
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:49008:133"/>
properly said of every producible
thing, but of our Golden Stone,
and other things equally mixt, that
they are made out of every thing:
for this reason especially, because
in those things which are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by an equal, but by an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equate
proportion of the Elements,
all the Elements are not actually
existent, but in their adequate
activity and passion: for some of
the Elements are therein either in
an active or passive power, and the
rest are therein actually. But in
the Philosophers Stone, which is
Gold, being it is an uniform Work
of Nature, all the four Elements
active and passive are actually
therein, and permanent in an
equal proportion. For the Essence
or Nature of Gold, is nothing else
but the four Elements equally
mixed; not that their form and
matter may be said to be therein
equal, but their passive and active
power; that is, they are each alike
and equal not in quantity, but in
quality: because that the active
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:49008:134"/>
doth not exceed the passive in its
acting; nor on the other side, the
passive doth not exceed the active
by suffering more: because there
is an equal proportion as to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in our Gold, or in our Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,
double hot, double moist,
double cold, double dry, and all
these are actually therein, by
actual action and passion; that is,
Fire, Air, Water, and Earth, as we
have said before. And all these are
said to be alike, and equal in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
not quantity, because they
are equal in actives and passives;
and they are therefore durably
permanent in Gold, because the
passive in it consists permanently
in its active, and on the other part
the passive rises not up against the
active. And they ought not to be
alike in quantity; that is, there
ought not be so much matter of
Fire, as there is matter of Earth:
because then the Fire by reason of
its quality, would be everywhere
of an unequal activity with its
passive Earth, and of a far greater.
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:49008:134"/>
Wherefore there is in Gold, as to
its matter, but not as to its qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
much more of the heavier
and more passive Element, than of
the lighter and more active; that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, more in quantity: there is in
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t a greater quantity of Earth,
than Water; a greater quantity
of Water, than Air; a greater of
Air, than Fire: wherefore it is the
heaviest of all Metals. But in this
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nequal proportion of quantity,
there is an equal and like propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of quality, of hot, dry, moist,
and cold, because each of these is
in Gold, as hath been said. The
cause of which weight is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manency
of the solidity of the
Earth and Water, and the solution
of an homogeneous Water with
the Earth, because Water dissolves
an homogeneous Earth. Also their
intrinsical thorow mixture in their
very least particles, is the cause of
the weight; because the Water
as well in Gold, as <hi>Quick-silver,</hi>
suffers not the Earth to have any
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>res in it: which is otherwise in
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:49008:135"/>
other Metals, in which pores are
insensibly made in their congela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
because of the dross mingled
in those Metals all over, rejected
by the <hi>Mercurial</hi> nature and hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogeneous:
whereupon their light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
results, which is nothing else
but want of matter, and porous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the same, as weight is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but a solid addition of
matter. Wherefore if there were
in an equal commensurative quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
so much of the solid matter
of Fire, as there is of the matter
of Earth, Fire would be as weighty
as Earth. But the cause of the
weight of <hi>Saturn,</hi> is its immature
congelation, because it d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> not
yet reject the dross of its parts,
whence pores are made in it; but
the pure and impure abide through
mixt together in it everywhere,
as in the first crude <hi>Quick-silver,</hi>
in which the inspissation and coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation
is weak, for that cause
<hi>Saturn</hi> or Lead retains the weight
of its <hi>Quick-silver,</hi> not because of
the purity of its solid matter, but
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:49008:135"/>
because of its immature coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or coction. Wherefore if in
this Work you would not destroy
the Fire and Air, you must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
in a distinct and like propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the heat of the Compound:
But if you would not destroy the
Air and the Water, then in the
same Compound you must cherish
the humid: so in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
you may preserve the Water
and Earth, or the Earth and the
Fire, in the said Work, by preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
rightly, and by the artifice
of the Philosophick skill, both the
cold and dry: because if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
any one of them, the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
form and kind of Gold is
lost. For this cause the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
say, our Gold is made of
every thing, that is, of every Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
every Element being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsically
preserved in it, and
actually compounding it: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all the Elements are intrinsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
in act or power, the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of all compounded alterable
things, and for that cause are said
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:49008:136"/>
to be all things. Furthermore, my
Reverend Doctor, for your credits
sake, you must understand the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the Philosophers according
to the possibility of Nature, and
not according to the sound of
Words: For they have handled
this holy and hidden Art, and its
Secrets, under Similitudes, Fables,
Riddles, and obscure words, and
have hid it purposely, that it
might not be exposed to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned,
impious, and unworthy.
Furthermore, that I may go on to
other Heads of your Epistle, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the artifice of your Stone
to be a composure from Gold, but
from your writing I cannot appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
it, because you set not down
the first original of that Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.
Therefore I shall not need
to handle it more at large, till
you instruct me fully and more
plainly in its Composition and
Operation: For I cannot neither
believe that the <hi>Elixir,</hi> or <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
Stone,</hi> can consist of the signs
appearing in it, and of the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:49008:136"/>
of the nutritive vegetation of
the flaming Fire, which you attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to it, as I have openly shewed
in what I have said already. But
when I received your Work, and
the gift of so great a Secret sent
unto me, I at once understood
your unfeigned love, and free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in me. Wherefore for your
Friendship sake, I reserve your
Stone with me, and keep it as a
most acceptable gift, and shall
write unto you more concerning
it, when you shall declare it to me
more manifestly. But whereas you
say, that in your Stone there are
three, a Body, Spirit, and Soul,
(which is manifest to you by your
experience and work) the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers
when they said those three
natural things were in their arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
Stone, understood it by way
of resemblance and experiment:
For they called the Earth, its Body
and Bones; because it is an astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Compound, and restrains the
fluid Elements from their raw
flexibility, having the Fire also
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:49008:137"/>
with it symbolically by its driness,
But they called the Water and
Air, its Spirit; because they are
the Elements that moisten and
dissolve the Earth. But they called
the Air and Fire, the Soul; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they ripen and digest the
whole Compound. And they na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
them thus, with resemblance
unto Humane nature, because in a
well-constituted Flesh there ought
to be Bones to sustain the Body,
and likewise there ought to be in
the Flesh a vivacity of vegetable
Accidents, which are called its
Spirits: contrary to the errors
of the Pagan Philosophers, who
thought the vital Spirits to be
something distinct from the Body
compounded, and parts compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
it: so also there must be in
Humane Flesh an informing Soul,
digesting in man the brutal acts,
and to work in him the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual
work. But we must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it otherwise in our Stone, in
which the Earth hath the name of
the Body, Air and Water obtain
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:49008:137"/>
the name of Spirit, neither is in
it a Soul but because it contains
the Air and Fire; which I perceive
well, you do perfectly understand.
But the Philosophers divided them
in this manner: By a crude Spirit,
they extracted a digested Spirit
out of the dissolved Body, and
they had remaining a fixed mass
of Ashes to be farther dissolved, in
which they found an incombusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and stony oyliness and gum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miness,
which they called the
Soul; which enlivens, unites, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerates
and produces united Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
and in the Spirit they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
the Natures, so in the Oyl
they re-conjoyned them. For our
Sto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> hath not an informing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as a Vegetative or a Sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
but it hath only a formed
form, which form is the very Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
themselves, because it is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeneous.
But mans Body, and
that of other Sensitives, is hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous:
For Bones, Flesh, Bloud,
Marrow, Hair and Nails, are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
differently in it; which
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:49008:138"/>
is otherwise in Gold, in which
whatsoever there is, is found to be
of one kind. Wherefore, my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
Doctor, the Philosophers
speak this by way of similitude,
by reason of the administration of
Art, and operation of Nature:
not because there is a Soul in the
Stone, but metaphorically, (as
you well know) nor Spirit, nor
Body, (as an informing form) as
it is found in Man, and other Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitives.
Verily I tell you, that
Oyl which naturally incerates and
unites Natures, and naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
the Medicine into other Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
that are to be tinged, is not
compounded of any other extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
thing, but out of the bowels
of the Body that is to be dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
which Oyl retains the colour
of its Spirit always, until it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thickned,
and then first of all it
puts on the Royal Ensigns, that is,
a citrineness and Metalline form,
which it manifests to all; in Gold,
a Golden, in Silver, a Silver co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
and form: which Oyl if it be
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:49008:138"/>
                  <hi>Sol,</hi> being dissolved, is perceived to
be red inwardly, though outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it appear white, under the form
of liquid <hi>Quick-silver.</hi> Now some
think to compound an Oyl as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
and powerful as this Oyl
is, namely out of <hi>Mercury</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dryed, or out of the substance
of Tin, or Body of the Sun, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed
with ingredients of divers
kinds; but for what concerns our
Work, their Experiment is falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.
They can indeed reduce the
<hi>species</hi> of Metals into a kind of
Oyl, but they cannot at any hand
reduce them into a Metallick
kind, observing and keeping the
proportion of the things to be
mixed sound and entire. But that
Oyl may be profitable for Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
to sensitive Creatures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the nature of Gold is dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
therein; but yet impertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and unprofitably as to our Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophick
Work. Besides, my Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
Doctor, that I may lightly
touch on the remaining Heads of
your Epistle, you must diligently
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:49008:139"/>
and wisely observe, that Fire and
<hi>Azor,</hi> wash <hi>Laton:</hi> But <hi>Azor</hi> is
not raw <hi>Quick-silver</hi> simply ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
out of the Mine, but it is
that which is extracted by <hi>Quick-silver</hi>
it self, out of the dissolved
Bodies; which is found to be more
ripe upon tryal. Wherefore if <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
be an unclean Body, it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purated
by such an <hi>Azor,</hi> which
you write that you have had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly;
and by this <hi>Laton</hi> puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by <hi>Azor,</hi> we make our Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
for curing every sick person.
Indeed this <hi>Azor</hi> is made of the
<hi>Elixir,</hi> because <hi>Elixir</hi> is nothing
else but a Body resolved into a
<hi>Mercurial</hi> Water; after whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
<hi>Azor</hi> is extracted out of
it, that is, an animated Spirit.
And it is called <hi>Elixir,</hi> from <hi>E,</hi>
which is <hi>out of,</hi> and <hi>Lixis,</hi> which
is <hi>Water,</hi> because all things are
made out of this Water: and
<hi>Elixir</hi> is the second part in the
Philosophick Work, as <hi>Rebis</hi> is
the first in the same Work. But
the Tincture constitutes the third
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:49008:139"/>
Work; for as the matter of this
Composition produces divers ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
so it obtain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> different names
one after another. Thence it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
appears, that <hi>Azor</hi> is not
requisite to the <hi>Elixir,</hi> because in
this Work the <hi>Elixir</hi> goes before
<hi>Azor,</hi> and not the contrary; like
as Water procedes the Oyl, and
the Spirit the Soul: For <hi>Azor</hi> is
drawn and extracted out of the
<hi>Elixir,</hi> as Oyl out of Water, and
not contrariwise; as mention is
made elsewhere. For example sake;
as in the Art of Physick, pure sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Fountain-water, by boyling in
the first concoction, is joyned with
the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> Flesh of a Chicken, and
thence in the first degree of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction
we obtain a Broth, a good
and perfect decoction, the humid,
watry and airy parts of the
Chicken being actually dissolved
in the aforesaid Water; though
there be other Elements therein
also actually. But that it may be
made a much more perfect Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,
and more generous for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:49008:140"/>
man's sick Body unto
health, the decocted Body of the
Chick is beaten into a mash, with
the said Water already altered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a boyled Broth, or with part of
it, and is distilled by a stronger
decoction, whence a Broth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction
will be made much more
noble and generous, partaking of
the whole nature of the Chicken:
Because by this second decoction
not only the moist parts, but the
hot parts, that is, its aërial and
fiery parts, being melted into the
Broth or decoction, are throughly
mingled and dissolved: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the whole virtue of the Chick
is in such a decoction extr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cted
into the aforesaid Liquor. So it
falls out in the Philosophick Work,
because the crude Mineral Spirit,
like Water, is joyned with its Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
to dissolve it in its first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction:
whence it is called <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis,</hi>
because it is compounded of
two, or a double thing, to wit, of
the Masculine and Feminine Seed,
that is, of the thing to be dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:49008:140"/>
though it be one thing and
matter: whence the Verses,
<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Rebis</hi> is two things joyn'd, yet it's

<hi>Sun</hi> or <hi>Moon.</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q>
Now out of these two things dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
together, the <hi>Elixir</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
that is, a tinged Water:
whence the Verses,
<q>
                     <l>Pure Bodies are of <hi>Lixis</hi> made by

                     <l>Hence Greeks <hi>Elixir</hi> term its second-part.</l>
                  </q>
Out of this <hi>Elixir,</hi> my Venerable
Doctor, as out of the first Broth
or B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>llion of a simple decoction,
<hi>Azor</hi> is extracted, to wit, by a
stronger and iterated distillation:
which <hi>Azor</hi> resembles and partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pates
the nature of its Body from
which it was extracted, which is
hot, and retains its virtue in it
self, namely an Oylie nature,
which is hot and moist, because it
is actual Fire and Air; though all
the Elements are in it in Essence,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:49008:141"/>
and by Composition. Medicines
therefore to cure the Bodies of
Sensitives, may be composed out
of the said Metals by several arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices;
but they are not pertinent
to the Philosophick Work, as the
<hi>Elixir</hi> is to <hi>Azor:</hi> that is, the
vital Spirit and fugitive Soul are
not diaphanous, nor transparent
as the clear tear from the Eye:
nor every dissolving Spirit, though
they be each of higher Natures
than another, according to their
degrees, as the Soul is higher than
the crude Spirit, being they are
not of one form. For as the Soul
lies hid under the <hi>species</hi> of a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
Spirit, before its re-inspis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
(for the Soul being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
out of the Body, always
appeareth like <hi>Quick-silver)</hi> so
after its inspislation the Soul and
Body lie hid under the <hi>species</hi> of a
Body. Your Worship hath seen an
Experiment thereof, in the Powder
sometime sent to that King whose
Physician you are; in which Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment,
<hi>Quick-silver</hi> was found in
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:49008:141"/>
the <hi>species</hi> of <hi>Quick-silver,</hi> but if
that which remained in the bottom
had been coagulated, it would
certainly have assumed the same
form of Powder: But that Powder
must be called a Tincture nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
only, not that it is a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
for Metals, for it is not yet
perfectly fixt; yet as a Medicine
for Men, it is of very good force.
But the fixt Medicine without all
doubt exceeds this humane Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
in all virtues, both as to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
and to Men; which cannot
come to pass in a clear diaphanous
and transparent Liquor: Because
if the aforesaid <hi>Elixir</hi> and <hi>Azor,</hi>
that is, Spirit and Soul, did appear
in, and had a transparency, now
the Earth as to its proportion had
left the Water, and had been sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from it, which had thickned
and coagulated its parts, causing
an opacity in the <hi>Elixir</hi> and <hi>Azor,</hi>
and making a congealable Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
form to consist. For in the
condensing of fixed Metallick <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi>
the condenser must act upon
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:49008:142"/>
the condensable, and the coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
upon the coagulable; which
cannot be in the aforesaid diapha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
and clear Water. But it
happens otherwise in Vegetables,
in which a simple and diaphanous
Water is thickned by decoction
into the Vegetables themselves:
which yet by the Test of the Fire
doth at length vanish and evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
because it is not permanent
and fixed in its composition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it had not with it an Earth
naturally homogeneal to it in its
composition, as <hi>Quick-silver</hi> hath:
which Earth indeed is the cause
of permanent fixation in homoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
things: wherefore simple
Water cannot by coagulation be
so fixed with Vegetables, as <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi>
with Metals. If therefore
<hi>Mercury</hi> should be reduced to a
transparency in the Work of the
Philosophers, it would by good
reason remain of an uncoagulable
substance; nor would it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed
upon <hi>Laton</hi> to a Metallick
form, <hi>species</hi> and proportion, which
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:49008:142"/>
carries not with, nor in it self its
own congelation, namely Water
the Earth: which Earth (as was
said) is <hi>Mercurial,</hi> and the first
cause of Inspissation, Coagulation,
and Fixation. If then this Water
abide destitute of Metallick pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
how should it be possible
that such like <hi>species</hi> should be
produced from this Composition?
They also erre who think to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
a limpid transparent Water
out of <hi>Mercury,</hi> and out of it to
work many wonderful things: For
be it so that they can perfect such
a Water, that Work would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
nothing either to Nature or
proportion, nor could it restore or
build up any perfect kind of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal:
For so soon as <hi>Mercury</hi> is
throughly changed from his first
Nature, so soon he is forbidden
entrance into our Philosophick
Work, because he hath lost his
Spermatick and Metallick Nature.
From these things it is manifest,
what truth there is in your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and in what it is contrary
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:49008:143"/>
and improper, when you say, there
must be had (as I think) to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
the highest <hi>Elixir,</hi> a Gum in
which are all things necessary
thereunto, and containing the four
Elements, and it is a most clear
Water as a tear from the Eye,
made Spiritual, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which make
Gold to be a mere Spirit: For a
Body penetrates not a Body, but
a subtle congealed Spiritual sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
which penetrates and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
a Body. Let it be so as you
say, my Venerable Doctor, that
Natures are not joyned but in a
Gum or Oylie substance, and
equal proportioned, having a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Nature, the Elements being
yet fixedly shut up in it; un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o
which Gumminess the whole Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
Stone is at last reduced
by Inceration, under a gentle flux,
after the manner of an Incera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
resembling all the Elements,
standing like Copper and in the
nature of Copper, existing also in
a subtle Spiritual Nature penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and colouring Metallick Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:49008:143"/>
For this Stone in the subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the first crude Body,
hath not lost its kind, namely of
the same Spirit, neither yet in the
perfect and great Gum doth it
lose its first Nature: Therefore
Gum and Oyl belong not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
unto this Work, but as Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
equally proportioned shut
up together, resolvable, united in
the Oylie viscosity of the Earth,
retained, buried, inseparably mixt.
For this Gum or Oyl first is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
out of the Body, drawn
into an incinerated Spirit, till the
superfluous humidity of the Water
be turned into Air, and one Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be excited from another
Element by digestion, and what
was of an Aqueous form, become
of an Oylie nature: and so the
whole Stone at last assumes the
name of Gum and <hi>Sulphur.</hi> For
<hi>Geber</hi> teacheth this, when he saith,
as you have written in your Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
If any person know to joyn
and friendly unite our <hi>Sulphur</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Bodies, he hath found one of
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:49008:144"/>
the greatest Secrets, and one way
of perfection: as if he should say,
If any man can reduce a Body to
this, that it may be made a Gum
which may be throughly mingled
with other imperfect Bodies, he
hath found the greatest Secret of
Nature, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> because this perfect
Stone is a Gum and a <hi>Sulphur,</hi> as
is known by what we have already
said. But you must know, that
<hi>Geber</hi> with highest prudence and
wonderful artifice hides the truth
under a Veil, intermingling with
it many obscurities and falsities,
which those who are ignorant at
first appearance imagine to be
truth: yet he speaking like a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher
secretly under this craft,
doth openly, learnedly and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophically
describe the truth:
wherefore the unexperienced and
Sophisters, not understanding his
mind and wit, nor the nature of
the thing, do perversly turn aside
to the vulgar exposition and sound
of the words. For he saith, If thou
knowest that, we have said some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:49008:144"/>
to thee; but if thou knowest
not, we have said nothing to thee.
Wherefore in reading Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick
Books, consider especially
the possibility of Nature; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
some Writers of this
Art have also sometimes erred,
and have happened sometimes to
have handled it, as to the natural
truth, either ill or ambiguously.
As it may be observed that <hi>Arnol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus
de Villa Nova</hi> hath said, in a
Book which he called his <hi>Rosary.</hi>
that raw <hi>Mercury,</hi> that is, <hi>Quick-silver,</hi>
which in its own nature is
cold and moist, by Sublimation
may be made hot and dry; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
being revived, it becomes
hot and moist like the complexion
of Man. You will say then, what
wonder is it if it be joyned with
the Sun, that it likewise becomes
of the nature of the Sun? For
<hi>Mercury</hi> is of a convertible nature,
as the Heavenly <hi>Mercury,</hi> which is
such as the Planet is with which it
is in Conjunction. For that <hi>Arnol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi>
though in other Sciences he
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:49008:145"/>
were a Reverend and Ingenious
Doctor, yet in this Art he handled
Experiments only, without the
learning of the Causes. Now when
he saith, that in the first Sublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the crude Spirit is sublimed
from the inferiour salt Minerals,
and that <hi>Mercury</hi> it self, which in
its own nature is cold and moist,
becomes a Powder of an hot and
dry nature, as he saith, this yet
conduces nothing to our Work.
But let it be so, that he makes
of <hi>Mercury</hi> such a Powder as he
speaks of, that is, throughly dried
and hot by sublimation from
Salts; yet those Purifications are
vain and impertinent to our
Work, yea as to the perfecting of
our Work they are hurtful. For
though these inferiour Minerals
communicate with Metals in their
nature, yet not in kind and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion:
For the superiour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
Minerals, in their nativity
and subterraneous formation, are
of one and the same constitution
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>niversally, and therefore of the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:49008:145"/>
same nature; but they differ in
proportion, quality, and kind or
form. Wherefore if <hi>Mercury</hi> be
distilled with those inferiour Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
and throughly dried, then
his internal nature is confounded
and disproportioned, and is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and made unprofitable, as to
the effect of a Feminine Seed, and
invalid for our Metallick Work.
For so soon as he is turned into the
form of a Powder, (except from
his Body of <hi>Sol</hi> or <hi>Luna)</hi> so soon
he undergoes a through driness,
unprofitable to the Philosophick
Work. Yet I deny not, but that a
drossie and impure <hi>Mercury</hi> may
and ought, by a simple Salt, be
sublimed or purged once or oftner,
according to a due Philosophick
experience, to take from it its
dro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s and outward Mineral impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
so that notwithstanding the
fluidity and radical humidity of
<hi>Mercury</hi> may always remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altered:
For the <hi>Mercurial</hi> kind
and form in such a Work, ought
to remain uncorrupted, as hath
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:49008:146"/>
been said already. Nor ought its
outward form to be reduced into
a throughly dried Powder; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
its external form being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
shews its internal nature
to be confounded, unless it be in
the way of generation that it be
altered, as may be manifestly seen
in the signs which appear in the
Work of the natural way. For
there are Sublimations of <hi>Mercury</hi>
from its own proper Bodies, which
are conjoyned and mingled with
it, by an Amalgamation with it in
its most inward parts, from which
being oftentimes raised and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united,
it rejects and loses its su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities,
and is not confounded
in its nature; and afterwards it is
very agreeable to the Philosophick
Work, and powerful to dissolve
Metallick <hi>species;</hi> yet it is not
greatly altered intrinsically for
the Philosophick Work, unless it
be altered by fixed Bodies dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in it. But wonderful things
may be done in Medicines for
Sensitives from this dried Powder,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:49008:146"/>
whether it be reduced into an Oyl,
or into Water, or it abide in a
Powder; but it is not at all perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
to the Philosophick Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And therefore it must be
universally noted, that so soon as
<hi>Mercury</hi> is turned into a Powder,
of whatever sort, contrary to the
nature of its Body to be dissolved,
so soon will it be unprofitable to
the Philosophick Work. There are
certain deceiving Sophisters, who
by joyning <hi>Venus</hi> to it, or adding
other <hi>species,</hi> make a Sophistick
Work; that is, they give unto im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
Copper a colour, but not
natural; they induce indeed a
kind of an apparency, but not a
true nature, that is, transmuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
like as he that paints a dead
Image, or composes a Statue of
Wood, which appears only, but is
not; and as much as a living
differs from an Image and Picture,
so much differs their Work from
the Philosophick. Hence this mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
perseveres not in the Test of
the Fire, though it be Mineral;
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:49008:147"/>
because Nature attracts it not
from a proportionable digestion,
nor hath Art vehemently decocted
it to an alteration of the mixt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
wherefore that Copper ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to be superficially only, and
not permanently and intrinsically
tinged. Wherefore we must not
adhere to the Experiments of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful
Sophisters, because the
truth of the natural Art confutes
this Sophistick Work, and shews it
to be false. And if you will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
farther, and say, that as the
said <hi>Armaldus</hi> by Sublimation pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
away the dross of <hi>Mercury,</hi>
and dried it in its nature; so also
(as you say) he by reviving it,
moistned it again, and made the
<hi>Mercury</hi> it self hot and moist, and
in its nature conformable to its
Body. This hinders not (my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
Doctor) nor refutes the
truth of the Philosophick Art, yea
rather an errour appears in the
Natural Art: For, as is manifest,
<hi>Arnaldus</hi> doth teach, if you regard
the found of his words, that <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi>
                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:49008:147"/>
thus throughly dried, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived
by hot water into which it
is cast; and he saith that it is
made hot and moist, when it
was first sublimed hot and dry.
But what true Philosopher would
say, that <hi>Mercury</hi> or any other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
is changed in nature and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
quality by simple Water,
however hot or boyling, or that it
could thence acquire its natural
humidity, and so be revived?
Therefore <hi>Mercury</hi> in this revival
acquires nothing, because common
Water neither decocts nor alters
it, because it neither hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
nor ingress into it, and
that which neither hath entrance
nor ingress, alters not; because
every thing to be altered, must
first be throughly mingled. For
indeed such a Water may wipe
away from it some superficial dross
swimming upon it, but cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
into it a new quality: For
what nature soever <hi>Mercury</hi> redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
into a Powder, and mortified
by Sublimations, retained, such
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:49008:148"/>
nature altogether it retains revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by Water. Now this I would
have to be spoken in honour and
respect unto the said <hi>Arnaldus;</hi>
but I contemplate and defend the
truth of Nature and Experience.
Furthermore, honoured Doctor,
that I may by this my Answer sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
your Epistle, and put an end
thereto, I humbly entreat you that
you would take in good part, and
favourably bear what I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
not by way of Confutation,
but Disputation: But if I have
answered any thing that offends
you, take it yet in good part and
favourably, or signifie it to me in
writing, and I will satisfie you to
