            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

for it is a great argument of our ſhame &amp;
imperfection that the holy things are written in

he himſelfe would not goe before them as hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

poſteritie degenerated from the ancient puritie of
our forefathers. When himſelfe refuſed to ſpeake
vnto our hearts becauſe of the hardneſſe of them,
he then began to put his lawes in writing. Which
thing for a long time amongſt his owne people
ſeemes not to haue brought with it any ſenſible
inconvenience. For amongſt all thoſe acts of the

The Chriſtian religion, a religion of great
ſimplicitie and perfection, hee troubled with do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
and ſuperſtition. For going about rather per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexedly
to ſearch the controverſies, then grauely
to compoſe them, he raiſed great ſtirres, &amp; by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
ſpread them farre and wide, whilſt he went
about to make himſelfe ſole Lord &amp; commander
of the whole profeſſion. Now (that it may appear
wherefore I haue noted this) it is no hard thing
for a man that hath wit, and is ſtrongly poſſeſt of
an opinion, and reſolute to maintaine it, to finde
ſome places of Scripture, which by good hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
will be woed to caſt a favourable cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance
vpon it. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> Schollers hauing beene bred
vp in the doctrine of numbers, when afterward
they diverted vpon the ſtudies of nature, fancied
vnto themſelues ſomewhat in naturall bodies like
vnto numbers, and therevpon fell into a conceit
that numbers were the principles of them. So
fares it with him that to the reading of Scripture
comes forepoſſeſt with ſome opinion. As <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheron

afore him: ſo indivers parts of Scripture where
theſe men walke, they will eaſily perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
that they ſee the image of their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits.
It was, &amp; is to this day, a faſhion in the hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
countries, at noone, when the ſunne is in his
ſtrength, to retire themſelues to their Cloſets or
beds, if they were at home, to coole &amp; ſhadie pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
if they were abroad, to avoid the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the heat of it. To this the Spouſe in the
Canticles alluding, calls after her beloued, as after
a ſhepheard: <hi>Shew me, O thou whom my ſoule loueth,
where thou feedeſt thy flocke, where thou doſt reſt at
noone.</hi> The <hi>Donatists</hi> conceiting vnto themſelues
that the Church was ſhut vp in them alone; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vrged by the fathers to ſhew how the Church
being vniverſall, came on a ſuddaine thus to bee
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>finde to Africke: they had preſently their Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
for it: for ſo they found it written in the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles:
<hi>Indica, quem diligit anima mea, vbi paſcas, vbi
cubes in meridie.</hi> In which text, <hi>meridies</hi> doubtleſſe
as they thought, was their Southerne countrie of
Africke, where the ſhepheard of Iſraell was, and
no where elſe, to feed his flockes. I may not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
you with inſtances in this kinde: little obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is able to furniſh the man of ſlendreſt reading
with abundance. The texts of Scripture which are
eſpecially ſubiect to this abuſe, are thoſe that are
of ambiguous and doubtfull meaning. For as <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydides</hi>
obſerues of the fat and fertile places of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3801:6"/>
Greece, that they were evermore the occaſions
of ſtirres and ſeditions; the neighbouring nations
every one ſtriuing to make it ſelfe Lord of them:
ſo is it with theſe places that are ſo fertile, as it
were, of interpretation, and yeeld a multiplicity of
ſenſe: they are the <hi>Palastra</hi> for good wits to proue
maſteries in, where every one deſires to bee Lord
and abſolute.</p>
            <p>A ſecond thing occaſioning vs to tranſgreſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

which in all other buſineſſe, and here likewiſe doth

            <p>I will add yet one third motioner to this abuſe
of Scriptures, and that is the too great preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
vpon the ſtrength and ſubteltie of our owne
wits. That which the Romane Prieſt ſometimes
told an overpleaſant and wirtie veſtall Virgin, <hi>Coli
Deos ſanctè magis quam ſcitè,</hi> hath in this great
worke of expoſition of Scripture an eſpeciall
place. The holy things of God muſt bee handled
<hi>ſanctè, magis quàm ſcitè,</hi> with feare and reverence,
not with wit and daliance. The dangerous effects
of this haue appeared, not in the greene tree only,
in young heads, but in men of conſtant age, and
great place in the Church. For this was that
which vndid <hi>Origen,</hi> a man of as great learning &amp;
induſtrie, as ever the Church had any; whilſt in
ſublimitie of his wit, in his Comments on Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

conceaving Meteors and aery ſpeculations,
he brought forth thoſe dangerous errors, which

looſe and wanton conceits in the heads of youth:
and hauing his choice given him either to aboliſh
his worke, or to leaue his Biſhopricke; not willing
to looſe the reputation of wit, choſe rather to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figne
his place in the Church, &amp;, as I verily thinke,
his part in heauen. And not in private perſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,

The Grecians, till barbariſme beganne to ſteale in
vpon them, were men of wonderous ſubtletie of
wit, and naturally over indulgent vnto themſelues
in this qualitie. Thoſe deepe and ſubtile hereſies
concerning the Trinitie, the divinitie of Chriſt &amp;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:3801:8"/>
of the holy Ghoſt, the vnion and diviſion of the
divine ſubſtance and perſons, were all of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in the heat of their wits: yea by the ſtrength
of them were they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceaved, &amp; borne &amp; brought
to that growth, that if it had beene poſſible for the
gates of Hell to prevaile againſt the Church, they
would haue prevailed this way. Wherefore as
God dealt with his owne land, which being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the mirrour of the world for fertilitie and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of all things, now lies ſubiect to many
curſes, and eſpecially to that of barrenneſſe: ſo at
this day is it with Greece. Where ſometimes was
the flow and luxurie of wit, now is there nothing
but extreame barbariſme and ſtupidity. It is in this
reſpect ſo degenerated, that it ſcarſly for ſome hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

with it two ill companions, pride, and levitie. By

multiplicitie of Authors: or that is not as Moſes
was, skilfull in all the learning of the AEgyptians:
but he that taking vpon him to divide the word of
God, is yet but raw and vnexperienced; or if hee

may ſmother and ſtrangle, he can never reſolue his

the worlds power to giue in this caſe a text of
ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t authority to compoſe &amp; fix the thoughts
of a ſoule, that is diſpos'd to doubt. But this great
inconvenience which held the world in vncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
by the providence of God is prevented in the
Church. For vnto it is left a certaine, vndoubted;
and ſufficient authority, able to exalt every valley,
and lay low every hill, to ſmooth all rubs, &amp; make
our way ſo open and paſſable, that little enquirie
ſerues. So that as it were a wonder in the ſchoole
of nature to find one ſetled and reſolued: ſo might
it ſeeme a marvaile that in the Church any man is
vnſtable, vnreſolued. Yet notwithſtanding even
here is the vnſtable ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> found too, &amp; to his charge
the Apoſtle laies this ſinne of wreſting of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
For ſince that it is confeſt at all hands, that
the ſenſe and meaning of Scripture is the rule and
ground of our Chriſtian tenents, whenſoever we
alter them, wee muſt needs giue a new ſenſe vnto
the word of God. So that the man that is vnſtable
in his religion can never be free from violating of
Scripture. The eſpeciall cauſe of this levitie and
flitting diſpoſition in the common and ordinary
ſort of men, is their diſabilitie to diſcerne of the
ſtrength of ſuch reaſons, as may be fram'd againſt
them. For which cauſe they vſually ſtart, and many

of thoſe leſſons which God teacheth vs: the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
and grounds of them, though they might be
giuen, yet it fits not that credit and truſt which we
owe him, once to ſearch into, or call in queſtion.
And ſo I come to the third generall part, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of wreſting of Scripture, in the laſt wordes,
<hi>vnto their owne damnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reward of every ſin is death. As the worme
eates out the heart of the plant that bred it: ſo
whatſoeuer is done amiſſe naturally workes no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
end, but the deſtruction of him that doth it.
As this is true in generall, ſo is it as true, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the Scripture doth preciſely note out vnto vs
ſome ſinne, and threatens death vnto it, it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
an argument, that there is more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie,
that there is ſome eſpeciall ſinne, which ſhall
drawe with it ſome eſpeciall puniſhment. This ſin
of wreſting of Scripture in the eie of ſome of the
ancients ſeem'd ſo ougly, that they haue ranged
it in the ſame ranke with the ſinne againſt the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt. And therefore haue they pronounced it
a ſinne <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>,<note place="margin">Iſidorus Peluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ota.</note> greater then can bee pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
For the moſt part of other ſinnes, are ſinns of
infirmitie or ſimplicitie, but this is a ſinne of wit
and ſtrength. The man that doth it, doth it with a
high hand; he knowes, and ſees, and reſolues vpon
it. Againe, Scripture is the voice of God: and it is
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:3801:14"/>
confeſt by all that the ſenſe is Scripture, rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the words. It cannot therefore be avoided, but hee
that wilfully ſtriues to faeſten ſome ſenſe of his

Thirdly,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1. 20.</note> 
               <hi>No Scripture is of private interpretation,</hi>
ſaith the Apoſtle. There can therfore be but two
certaine and infallible interpreters of Scripture: ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it ſelfe; or the holy Ghoſt the author of it. It
ſelfe doth then expound it ſelfe, when the wordes
&amp; circumſtances doe ſound vnto vs the prime, and
naturall, and principall ſenſe. But when the place
is obſcure, involu'd and intricate, or when there is
contain'd ſome ſecret and hidden myſtery, beyond
the prime ſenſe; infallibly to ſhew vs this, there can
be no interpreter but the holy Ghoſt that gaue it.
Beſides theſe two, all other interpretation is pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate.
Wherefore as the Lords of the Philiſtines
ſometimes ſaid of the kine that drew the arke vnto
Bethſhemeſh: <hi>If they goe of themſelues, then is this
from God, but if they goe another way, then is it not
from God, it is ſome chance that hath hapned vnto vs:</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:3801:14"/>
ſo may it bee ſaid of all pretended ſenſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
If Scripture come vnto it of it ſelfe, then is it
of God but if it goe another way, or if it bee vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
vrged and goaded on, then is it but a matter
of chance, of mans wit &amp; invention. As for thoſe
marvailous diſcourſes of ſome, fram'd vpon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
of the ſpirits helpe in private, in iudging
or interpreting of difficult places of Scripture, I
muſt needs confeſſe I haue often wondred at the
boldneſſe of them. The ſpirit is a thing of darke &amp;
ſecret operation, the maner of it none can deſcrie.
As vnderminers are never ſeene till they haue
wrought their purpoſe; ſo the ſpirit is never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved
but by its effects. The effects of the ſpirit
(as farre as they concerne knowledge and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction)
are not particular information for reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in any doubtfull caſe (for this were plainely
revelation) but as the Angell, which was ſent vnto
<hi>Cornelius</hi> informes him not, but ſends him to <hi>Peter</hi>
to ſchoole: ſo the ſpirit teaches not, but ſtirres vp
in vs a deſire to learne: Deſire to learne makes vs
thirſt after the meanes: and pious ſedulitie &amp; care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
makes vs watchfull in the choice, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
in the vſe of our meanes. The promiſe to the
Apoſtles of the ſpirit which ſhould lead them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all truth, was made good vnto them by private
and ſecret informing their vnderſtandings, with
the knowledge of high and heavenly myſteries,
which as yet had never entred into the conceit of
any man. The ſame promiſe is made to vs, but ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil'd
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:3801:15"/>
after another manner. For what was written
by revelation in their hearts, for our inſtruction
haue they written in their bookes. To vs for infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
otherwiſe then out of theſe bookes, the
ſpirit ſpeaks not. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſpirit regenerats a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
it infuſes no knowledge of any point of faith, but
ſends him to the Church and to the Scriptures.
When it ſtirres him vp to newneſſe of life, it exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
not vnto him an inventory of his ſinnes, as hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
vnknowne; but either ſuppoſes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> knowne
in the law of nature, of which no man can bee ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant;
or ſends him to learne them from the
mouth of his teachers. More then this in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
proceeding of the holy ſpirit, in matter of
inſtruction. I yet could never deſerie. So that to
ſpeake of the helpe of the ſpirit in private, either
in dijudicating, or in interpreting of Scripture, is
to ſpeake they knowe not what. Which I doe the
rather note, firſt, becauſe by experience we haue
learnt, how apt-men are to call their private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits,
the ſpirit: And againe, becauſe it is the eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall

ſeeme to haue made a religion to meddle

therefore amongſt their labours in expoſition of

But I conclude this point, adding onely this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
admonition, that we be not too peremprorie
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:3801:17"/>
in our poſitions, where expreſſe text of Scripture

               </gap> vs: that we lay not our owne collections &amp;
concluſions with too much praecipitancie. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
hath ſhewd vs, that the error and weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of them being afterwards diſcovered brings
great diſadvantage to Chriſtianitie, and trouble
to the Church. The Eaſterne Church before S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               <hi>Baſils</hi> time, had entertained generally a conceit,
that thoſe greeke particles <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and the reſt,
were ſo divided among the Trinitie, that each of
the perſons had his particle which was no way ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliable
to the reſt. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Baſil</hi> hauing diſcovered this
to be but a niceneſſe and needleſſe curioſitie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
to teach ſo, rais'd in the Church ſuch a
tumult, that hee brought vpon himſelfe a great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
of writing many tracts in apologie for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
with much adoe, eare matters could againe
be ſetled. The fault of this was not in <hi>Baſil,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly
fearing what by way of conſequence
might enſue vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an error, taught a truth; but in the
Church, who formerly had with too much facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
admitted a concluſion ſo iuſtly ſubiect to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.
And let this ſuffice for our third part.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe it is apparant that the end of this
our Apoſtles admonition is to giue the Church a
caveat how ſhee behaue her ſelfe in handling of
Scripture, giue me leaue a little, inſteed of the vſe
of ſuch doctrines as I haue formerly laid downe,

treads vs out another waie.</hi> I take not this to bee
any peculiar conceit of mine, but that vnto which
our Church ſtands neceſſarily bound. When wee
receded from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> one motiue
was, becauſe ſhe added vnto Scripture her gloſſes
as Canonicall, to ſupply what the plaine text of
Scripture could not yeeld. If in place of hers, wee
ſet vp our owne gloſſes, thus to doe, were nothing
elſe but to pull downe Baal, and ſet vp an Ephod;
to runne round, and meet the Church of Rome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
in the ſame point, in which at firſt wee left
her. But the plaine, evident and demonſtratiue
ground of this rule, is this. That authoritie which
doth warrant our faith vnto vs, muſt every way be
free from all poſſibilitie of errour. For let vs but
once admit of this, that there is any poſſibility that
any one point of faith ſhould not be true; if it bee
once granted that I may bee deceaued in what I
haue beleeued; how can I be aſſur'd that in the end
I ſhall not be deceaued? If the author of faith may
alter: or if the evidence and aſſurance that hee
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:3801:18"/>
hath left vs be not pregnant, and impoſſible to bee
defeated, there is neceſſarily opened an inlet to
doubtfulneſſe and wauering, which the nature of
faith excludes. That ſaith therefore may ſtand vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken,
two things are of neceſſitie to concurre.
Firſt, that the author of it bee ſuch a one, as can by
no meanes be deceaued, and this can bee none but
God. Secondly that the words and text of this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
vpon whom we ground, muſt admit of no
ambiguitie, no vncertainetie of interpretation. <hi>If
the trumpet giue an vncertaine ſound, who ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
himſelfe to battle.</hi> If the words admit a double
ſenſe, and I follow one, who can aſſure mee that
that which I followe is the truth? For infallibility
either in iudgement, or interpretation, or whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
is annext neither to the ſea of any Biſhop,
nor to the Fathers, nor to the Councells, nor to
the Church, nor to any created power whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
This doctrine of the litterall ſenſe was never
greivous or prejudiciall to any, but onely to thoſe
who were inwardly conſcious, that their poſiti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ons
were not ſufficiently grounded. When <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Caietan</hi> in the daies of our grandfathers had
forſaken that vaine of poſtilling and allegoriſing
on Scripture, which for a long time had prevailed
in the Church, and betaken himſelfe vnto the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall
ſenſe: it was a thing ſo diſtaſtfull vnto the
Church of Rome, that hee was forc'd to finde out
many ſhifts, &amp; make many apologies for himſelfe.
The truth is (as it will appeare to him that reads
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:3801:19"/>
his writings) this ſticking cloſe to the litteral ſenſe
was that alone, which made him to ſhake many of
thoſe tenents, vpon which the Church of Rome
and the reformed Churches differ. But when the
importunitie of the reformers, and the great cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
of <hi>Calvins</hi> writings in that kinde, had forced
the divines of Rome to levell their interpretations
by the ſame line: when they ſaw that no paines, no
ſubtletie of wit was ſtrong enough to defeat the
literall evidence of Scripture: it draue them on
thoſe deſperate ſhelfes, on which at this daie they
ſticke, to call in queſtion, as farre as they durſt, the
credit of the Hebrew text, &amp; countenance againſt
it a corrupt tranſlation; to add traditions vnto
Scripture; and to make the Churches interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſo pretended, to bee aboue exception. As for
that reſtriction which is vſually added to this rule,
that the literall ſenſe is to be taken, if no abſurdity
follow, though I acknowledge it to be ſound and
good, yet my adviſe is that we entertaine it warily.
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Baſil</hi> thought the precept of Chriſt to the rich
man in the Goſpell, <hi>Goe ſell all thou hast and giue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

and eternally binding all Chriſtians without ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ception.
And making this obiection, how poſſibly
ſuch a life could bee amongſt Chriſtians, ſince
where all are ſellars, none could be buyers: <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>Aske not me the ſenſe of my Lords commands. He
that gaue the law, can provide to giue it poſsibilitie of

ſpeech, howſoever we may ſuppoſe the occaſion
of it to be miſtaken; yet is it of excellent vſe, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
our boldneſſe, whereby many times, vnder
pretence of ſome inconvenience, we hinder Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
from that latitude of ſenſe, of which it is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
capable. You knowe the ſtory of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane

reſpect of the paines taken in making of them
they are labour and travaile: yet much of them is
of excellent vſe in private, either to raiſe our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
or to ſpend our meditations, or (ſo it bee
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:3801:20"/>
with modeſtie) to practiſe our gifts of wit to the
honour of him that gaue them. For if wee abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
condemne theſe interpretations, then muſt
we condemne a great part of antiquitie, who are
very much converſant in this kinde of interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
For the moſt partiall for antiquitie cannot
chuſe but ſee and confeſſe thus much, that for the
litterall ſenſe the Interpreters of our owne times,
becauſe of their skill in the originall languages,
their care of preſſing the circumſtances and cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the text, of comparing like places of
Scripture with like, haue generally ſurpaſt the beſt
of the ancients. Which I ſpeake not to diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
antiquitie, but that all ages, all perſons may
haue their due. And let this ſuffice for our firſt
rule.</p>
            <p>The Iewiſh <hi>Rabbines</hi> in their Comments on
Scripture ſo oft as they met with hard and intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
texts, out of which they could not wreſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
were wont to ſhut vp their diſcourſe with
this, <hi>Elias cum venerit, ſolvet dubia:</hi> Elias ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
this doubt when he comes. Not the Iewes
only, but the learned Chriſtians of all ages haue
found many things in Scripture which yet expect
<hi>Elias.</hi> For beſides thoſe texts of Scriptures, which
by reaſon of the hidden treaſures of wiſdome, and
depth of ſenſe &amp; myſterie laid vp in them, are not
yet conceau'd, there are in Scripture of things that
are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>ſeemingly confus'd,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſemblance of contrarietie, anachroniſmes, meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chroniſmes,</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:3801:20"/>
and the like, which bring infinite ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuritie
to the text: there are I ſay in Scripture
more of them, then in any writing that I knowe
ſecular or divine. If wee meane not to ſettle our
ſelues till all theſe things are anſwered, let vs take
heed leaſt the like be ſaid to vs, which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Auſtine</hi>
ſaid to ſome of the Gentiles, who refuſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
till all obiections were ſatisfied: <hi>ſunt enim in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerabiles
quae non ſunt finiendae ante fidem, ne vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta
finiatur ſine fide.</hi> The <hi>Areopagites</hi> in <hi>Athens,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
they were troubled in a doubtfull caſe in which
they durſt not proceed to ſentence, were wont
<hi>cauſam in diem longiſsimam differre,</hi> to put it off till
a day of hearing for ſome hundreth yeares after, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding
by this meanes the further being impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tun'd
with the ſuit. To quiet our ſelues in theſe
doubts it will be our beſt way <hi>in diem longiſsimam
differre,</hi> to put them to ſome day of hearing a farre
off, even till that great day, till Chriſt our true
<hi>Elias</hi> ſhall come, who at his comming ſhal anſwer
all our doubts, and ſettle all our waverings. Meane
while till our <hi>Elias</hi> come, let vs make vſe of this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
rule. <hi>In places of ambiguous and doubtfull, or
darke and intricate meaning, it is ſufficient if we reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly
admire and acknowledge and confeſse: vſing
that moderation of Auſtine: Neutram partem affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantes
ſiue deſtruentes, ſed tantummodo ab audaci af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmandi
praeſumptione revocantes. Qui credit,</hi> ſaith

belongs to Chriſt the author of our faith to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:3801:21"/>
vs is ſufficient the glory of beleeuing. Wherefore
we are to adviſe, not ſo much how to attaine vnto
the vnderſtanding of the myſteries of Scripture;
as how it beſt fits vs to carry our ſelues when ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the difficultie of the text, or varietie of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ſhall diſtract vs. In the ſixth generall Councell
<hi>Honorius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is condemned for a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothelite.</hi>
Two Epiſtles there are of his which are
produc'd to giue evidence againſt him. For the
firſt I haue nothing to ſay. For the ſecond) I ſpeak
with ſubmiſſion to better iudgement) notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the ſharpe proceeding of the Councell
againſt him, I vrerily ſuppoſe that hee giues vnto
the Church the beſt counſaile, that ever yet was
giuen for the ſetling of doubts, and finall deciſion
of controverſie. For that which he teaches in that
Epiſtle, at leaſt in thoſe parts of it, which there are
brought, ſounds to no other purpoſe but this:
<hi>That whereas there was lately raiſed in the Church a
controverſie concerning the dualitie or vnitie of wils
in Chriſt; ſince that hitherto nothing in the Church
concerning either part hath beene expreſly taught, his
counſaile was that men would rather ceaſe to doubt,
then to be curious to ſearch for any ſolution of their
doubtings; and ſo abſtaine from teaching doctrinally
either part, and content themſelues with that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſse
meaſure of faith, with which the Church hath
hitherto reſt ſatisfied.</hi> This to my conceit is the drift
of his Epiſtle. How this adviſe of the Biſhops was
appliable or how it fitted the queſtion then in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:3801:21"/>
or what reaſon moued the Councell to
thinke that it was abſolutely neceſſary for them,
to giue an expreſſe deciſion, and determine for the
one part, belongs not to me to diſcuſſe. But I veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perſwade my ſelfe, that if it had pleaſed thoſe,
who in all ages haue beene ſet to governe the
Church of God; betimes to haue made vſe of this
adviſe, to haue taught men rather not to haue
doubted, then to haue expected ſtill ſolution of
their doubtings: to haue ſtopt and damm'd vp the
originals and ſprings of controverſies, rather then
by determining for the one part, to giue them as
it were a pipe and conduit to convaie them to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie,
I perſwade my ſelfe the Church had not
ſuffred that invndation of opinions, with which at
this day it is overrunne. Is it not S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Pauls</hi> owne
practiſe, when hauing brought in a queſtion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Gods iuſtice in predeſtination, hee giues
no other anſwere but this, <hi>O man, who art thou that
diſputeſt with God?</hi> Is it not his plaine purpoſe to
adviſe the diſputer rather not to make the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
then to require a determination of it at his
hands? How many of the queſtions even of our
owne times, even of thoſe that are at home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
vs, might by this way long ſince haue
beene determind? I haue, I confeſſe, the ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
that my firſt parents in Paradiſe had, a deſire
to knowe more then I need. But I alwaies thought
it a very iudicious commendation, which is given
