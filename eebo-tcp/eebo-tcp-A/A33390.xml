            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Once being in company, each man was vaunting of his honesty; one amongst the rest starts up, and speaks thus:</p>
               <p>I am a man which was borne with as much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty as the best man here, and have made as little use of it: wherefore they all concluded, that he had the more to come: so, although your Grace hitherto have made but little use of grace, be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted with this, that the more grace is to come.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Laud.</speaker>
               <p>So truely I hope. But prethee friend, tell me seriously, what is the common report abroad concerning me? doe not flatter, but speak the truth.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Scriv.</speaker>
               <p>I hope your Grace doth not take me to be any of the Devils sonne in Laws, for he is father of all lyes, as for my part I could never indure him, he hath such a damnable hot breath, nay, and he stinks as bad; some say he had the Patent for Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, which was the reason that not long since Tiffenies were out of fashion.</p>

               <p>As the Priest said, when he did you wot what: but to answer your demand; and if it please your Grace, there are so many things reported a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad concerning you, that I had need to have as many tongues as <hi>Argus</hi> had eyes, to report them to your Grace: but hoping you will take my will for the deed, I thus begin. Some say you are a Papist, for setting up Altars; others a murtherer for the death of <hi>Thomas Bensteed</hi>; others a foe to young <hi>Gregory</hi> the hangman.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

            <sp>

               <p>So they doe, I went the other day to the Apothecaries for a little Ratsbane to kill the Ratts about my house, and he would not let me have it, because he knew I was one of your Graces favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, least I should bring it unto you, and you should poyson your selfe with it, and so save the hangman a labour.

               <p>First, I bestow my Miter, with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenances, which have been upholders of my pride, and causers of my downfall, to some lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and pious Prelate, which may make better use of it, than ever I did.

            <sp>
               <speaker>Laud.</speaker>
               <p>I will truely define him unto thee; He is one which goeth about in sheeps cloathing, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly is a ravening wolfe; his sole intention is to rob God of glory, and man of felicitie: he is the Antichrist, the whore of Babylon, the chiefe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracer of all ambitious thoughts; wherefore let all men as they tender their own salvation, beware of him, and his cursed deeds; his thoughts are bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and his paths lead unto destruction.</p>

               <speaker>Scriv.</speaker>
               <p>Say you so? for that tricke I will never goe to Rome, least like a roaring Lyon he should devoure me: Now if it please your Grace to goe forward, I am ready.</p>

               <speaker>Laud.</speaker>
               <p>Thirdly, my Manuscripts I bequeath to the fire, because they savour rather of Popery than sound Religion: my Books to poore Schollers, and best of my Chaplaines, which are most free from the sect of the Arminians.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the wealth which I have besides, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow it freely (with the leave of the Parliament)
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93614:4"/>
upon all those which I ever wronged, which my conscience tels me are too many, that to think of it my heart is ready to breake. A few more Legacies I have yet to bestow, which are these; My prayers for the whole Realme; my admonition to future Judges, that they forsake and contemne bribery, and love and cherish equitie. My counsell to the Hierarchy; that they be humble minded, tender hearted, piously affected, industriously to their stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies bended, preaching painfully and purely, that it may prove to the edification and salvation of the people: let my falling by sinne, be a cause of their rising by grace: but let those of the Episcopacy beware especially of pride, which is a vice so hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid in the sight of God, that for it he made <hi>Lucifer</hi> which was a shining Angel in heaven, to be a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned fiend in hell.</p>

               <p>Thy Argument is of no consequence; it is sufficient that I have deserved Death, and how soone I may have according to my desert, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to me, wherefore it is good to take Time whilst Time is.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I can onely be sorry for your misfortune, and thats as much as I can doe.</p>

               <p>For thy sorrow I thanke thee, but alas, it can doe me no good; it must be prayer of others, and penitency of my own, must lead me unto true beatitude and comfort.</p>
