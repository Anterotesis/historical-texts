            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEREAS We have been informed of certain Propoſitions agreed upon by ſome ſeditious Perſons of Our ſeverall Counties of <hi>Kent, Surry, Suſſex</hi> and <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> for an Aſſociation betwixt the ſaid Counties, to raiſe an Army of 3000 Foot, and 300 Horſe, and great ſummes of Money for the maintenance thereof, and an Invitation to Our good Subjects of that County, to enter into a Proteſtation to aſſiſt them in this odious and unnaturall Rebellion; We doe hereby Declare for the ſatisfaction of all our loving Subjects of thoſe Counties, and that they may not be ſeduced from their Obedience by the cunning and ſubtilty of thoſe men, That the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into ſuch an Aſſociation and Proteſtation, and raiſing of men or contributing Money upon the ſame, is an Act of high Treaſon, and an endeavour to take away Our Life from Vs: And We do therefore ſtraitly Charge and Command all Our lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Subjects whatſoever upon their Allegiance not to enter into any ſuch Aſſociation or Proreſtation, and ſuch, as by colour of ſuch Authority have aſſembled together, that they immediately disband and repaire to their Houſes. And We doe once more renew Our offer of a free and gratious Pardou to all Our Subjects of Our ſaid foure ſeverall Counties, excepting thoſe whom We before excepted in Our ſeverall Proclamations concerning thoſe Our Counties, againſt all which We ſhall proceed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rules of the Law, as againſt Perſons guilty of high Treaſon; And whom We doe hereby require all Our Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and Miniſters of Juſtice, and all Our loving Subjects whatſoever, to apprehend and cauſe to be kept in ſafe cuſtody. And Our Expreſſe Pleaſure is, and We doe hereby Will and Command all the ſeverall Tenants of the Perſons excepted in Our Proclamation for thoſe foure Counties of <hi>Kent, Surrey Suſſex,</hi> and <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> and all other Perſons who are any wayes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted unto them, and all the Tenants to any other Perſon of any of the ſaid Counties, who is now in Actuall and open Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt Us, or who after the publiſhing of this Our Proclamation ſhall contribute to the maintenance of the Armies now in Rebellion againſt Us, under the conduct of <hi>Robert</hi> Earle of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> or of any other
Perſon or Perſons, or that ſhall joyne in any ſuch traiterous Aſſociation or Proteſtation, That they forbeare to pay any Rents or Debts due to the ſaid ſeverall Perſons, but detaine the ſame in their hands towards the maintenance of the Peace of the Counties, and the reparation of ſuch Men who have ſuffered by the violence of the others. And if any Souldier or Souldiers now under Command againſt Us in either of Our ſaid foure Counties,
ſhall within ſix dayes after the publiſhing of this Our Proclamation, apprehend and bring before Us, or any Officers of Our Army, or any other Our Miniſter of Juſtice, ſo that the Perſon apprehended be kept in ſafe Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the
bodies of any of the Perſons ſo excepted by Us, or of any of the Commanders or Officers now in Rebellion againſt Us in any of the ſaid foure Counties, ſuch Souldier or Souldiers, beſides their Pardons, ſhall receive ſuch liberall Rewards by Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, or otherwiſe, as their ſeverall ſervices in reſpect of the qualities of the Perſons ſo apprehended ſhall deſerve. And, if any Commander or Officer (except the Perſons before excepted) now in Rebellion againſt Us, in any of the ſaid foure Counties, ſhall within five dayes after this Our Proclamation publiſhed, being convinced in his Conſcience of his damnable Offence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God and Us, in aſſiſting this
odious Rebellion, returne to his Alleagiance and repaire to Our Army, and commit no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile Act in the meane while againſt Us, We ſhall not onely Pardon him, but ſo far imploy him as his quality and demeanour ſhall deſerve. And We doe hereby require all Our loving Subjects of what degree or quality ſoever, within Our ſaid foure ſeverall Counties, upon their Allegiance, and as they tender the cauſe of God, the Proteſtant Religion, being invaded and threatned to be rooted up by <hi>Anahaptiſts, Browniſts</hi> and <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> of Us, and Our Poſterity (Our Life being ſought after by this Rebellion, and of themſelves, the Law and Liberty of the Subject being in apparent hazard to be ſubjected to an Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Lawleſſe power, of a few Schiſmaticall, factious, and ambitious Perſons) to aſſiſt Us in Perſon, or with the Loane of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, Plate, and Horſes, in this Our great neceſſity. And having ſaid thus much out of Our tender Regard of Our Subjects of thoſe our Counties; If they ſhall henceforward be guilty of the premiſes: And ſhall either by Loane or contribution aſſiſt the ſaid Army of Rebels, aſſemble and muſter themſelves in Armes withour Authority derived from Us under Our Hand, or ſhall enter into any Oath of Aſſociation for oppoſing Us and Our Army, and ſo compell Us to ſend part of Our Forces thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to reduce them to their Obedience; they muſt Anſwer the miſeries that muſt follow, to God, and their Country. And Our Pleaſure is, That this Our Proclamation be Read in all the Pariſh Churches and Chappels in the ſaid foure ſeverall Counttes.</p>
