         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

SPEECH
Before the Parliament in Scotland,

            <opener>
               <salute>My Lords,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is the part of him accuſed ſo farre as conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
ſhall give leave, and equity permit, to make
anſwere for himſelfe.</p>
            <p>J am arraigned here as a Traytour, which title to a
noble Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> J know cannot well be degeſted, neither
is it ſo to my ſelfe, where is that man that ſtriveth to
live moſt uprightly in this world, that hath not many
enemies, which J apply to my ſelfe, but patience is
the commendableſt of all the Cardinall vertues,
which J freely embrace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords,</hi> J preſent my ſelfe, nay humble my ſelfe
to you all, inſomuch as humility becomes a Priſoner,
but yet no further then J have beene criminous, your
Clemency J have found by the Lycenſe which hath
been freely given unto me, now here at this time to
<pb facs="tcp:96379:3"/>
ſcatter ſome few words, which ſhall be as briefe, as
ſpoken from a Loyall Subject.</p>
            <p>Long live King <hi>Charles</hi> our true and Loyall Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne,
Long live Queene <hi>Mary</hi> our gracious Queen,
and his Majeſties royall Spouſe, Long live Prince
<hi>Charles,</hi> the comfort of <hi>Wales,</hi> and hope of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
and the like J wiſh to all the reſt of his Majeſties Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
off-ſpring, and to all which are true and Loyall
Subjects to our King.</p>
            <p>Hitherto my Lords in Speech I hope I have not
been prolixious, nor erroneous, for it ſhall be my care,
as J doe my endeavour to defend my ſelfe, ſo that J
offend none of this honourable Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>Now my Lords, J come to my owne purgation,
that J as a chiefe Agent in the matter of the Marquiſſe
<hi>Hamilton,</hi> and divers others, was committed, your
commands I obeyed, and freely yeelded up my body,
not making of the leaſt diſturbance, yet I cannot but
admire, why I ſhould be ſuſpected to be a Traytor to
thoſe from whom J never received the leaſt of wrong
or injury, why ſhould the Land-lord diſturbe the
Tenant, during the time which he hath his Rent duely
pay'd him, why ſhould two Kingdomes ariſe &amp; take
up Armes one againſt another, no occaſion being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
on either ſide? Why ſhould the Lawyer ſue him
for Fees, which was never a Clyent unto him? Or
why ſhould J plot their deaths, which were never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
to my life, but as J ſaid before, the beſt man
breathing, lives not without his Adverſaries, neither
doe I, not knowing whom they be, or for what cauſe
they ſhould thus perſecute me, But the Divell hath
his wicked inſtruments, who are th' encendiaries and
<pb facs="tcp:96379:3"/>
diſturbers of Kingdomes and Common-wealths, like
ſo many Judaſſes, that ſtudyes nothing but how to
betray their Maſters, theſe are thoſe wicked <hi>Hamans</hi>
that to advance their owne power and greatneſſe, will
ſeeke to deſtroy and roote the poore <hi>Mordecaies</hi> out
of the Land.</p>
            <p>Jt is reported that <hi>Caeſar</hi> being Shipwrackt, was
forced to leape out of the Ship into the Sea, where
hee did ſwimme for his life, and yet managed his
Sword in one hand, and kept his Booke, wherein hee
writ all his Victories in the other hand, even ſo my
Lords, although my ſoule be as it were Shipwrackt
within my body through too much griefe of heart,
and vexation of mind, yet before either my honour
ſhall be ſtained, or my conſcience over-burthened, J
will couragiouſly yeeld my ſelfe to <hi>Charons</hi> Boate,
really to enjoy a happy <hi>Elizium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a common ſaying, and as true, that ill-will
never ſpeakes well, I have beene one, which in many
affayres, have beene very obſtinate, not being willing
to ſubſcribe to that, which others have agreed unto,
(for why) becauſe it could not bee Profitable to
the common wealth; And for this doe J deſerve
hatred, have J not beene vigilant and carefull to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
our friends, and offend our foes, and for this doe
J deſerve hatred; Then J, who was more willing to
have a peace concluded betweene this Kingdome and
England, and for this doe J deſerve hatred; my Lords
J petition that my accuſers may be produced, and he
which is not found to be more guilty of treachery
then my ſelfe, let him caſt the firſt ſtone at me, J am
fully perſwaded that if they thought themſelves as
<pb facs="tcp:96379:4"/>
ſure to be examined as my ſelf, there would ſcarce be
one of them dare ſhow ther heads, <hi>Magna vis eſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientia,</hi>
let them have a care leaſt by their intents to
deſtroy my body, they doe not ruine ther owne
ſoules, as yet my Lords I hope, my words being

at this preſent time before your Lordſhips.</p>
            <p>As concerning my Lord <hi>Lowden,</hi> that <hi>I</hi> ſhould
ſeeke to deſtroy him, methinks cannot be conceived
by any one to be truth, inſomuch as he is one, which
my very ſovle hath always affected, for rather then a
hayre of him ſhowld be diminiſhed by my meanes
J would firſt prove my owne deſtroyer,</p>
            <p>I ſee my adverſaries are at hand, being ready as it
were to juſtifie their black accuſations, which unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they have impoſed upon me, but I am prepared
for patience, deferring all to your Lordſhips conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
I doubt not, but that in this moſt honorable
Senate, Juſtice ſhall brightly ſhine, and I at laſt
ſhall be found immaculate, in deſpight of all thoſe
which ſeeke my deſtruction, at firſt <hi>I</hi> promiſed bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
and doe ſo intend, being ready as farr as God
ſhall inable me to Anſwer vnto all thoſe particulars
