            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF THE CREDITORS, OF Joſeph, and Nathaniel Hornby, In Relation to the Bill of Mrs. <hi>Katherine Fitz Gerald Villers,</hi> Widdow of <hi>Edward Fitz Gerald Villers</hi> Deceaſed.</head>
            <p>THE great Queſtion with Relation to the ſaid Creditors is, whither there ever was any ſuch Deed of Settlement Executed as is recited in the Mortgage, for 2000 <hi>l.</hi> made in <hi>May</hi> 86 by the ſaid <hi>Edward</hi> to Sr.<hi>Theophilus Oglethorpe</hi> in which it is recited, that the ſaid <hi>Edward</hi> had Power to grant or Mortagage the Lands in the Bill for raiſing any Summ, not exceeding 12000 <hi>l.</hi> for payment of the Debts, or Portions for his Younger Children: Now the Reaſons that induce the Creditors to believe there was a Deed Executed with ſuch Power is, for that the Mortgage was made within three Months after the Deed of Settlement, and the Draught of a Settlement was produced to Counſel, which was affirm'd to agree with the Deed; and therein there was ſuch a Power as is recited in the Mortgage to Sr. <hi>Theophilus</hi> and Mr.<hi>Edward Villers,</hi> the Mortgager was eſteemed a Gentleman of that Worth and Honour, that he would not have offered it as a ſecurity, in caſe he had no ſuch Power.</p>
            <p>Now admitting the Caſe to be otherwiſe, and that Mr. <hi>Edward Villers</hi> was miſtaken, and had no ſuch Power as is recited in the Mortgage, and that the Power he had was only what is given him by a Deed of the 24th of <hi>February</hi> 1685 which was produced to the Committee on <hi>Saturday</hi> laſt, whereby he had liberty by his laſt Will, or any other Writing by him to be perfected, to grant or convey the Eſtate for raiſing 12000 <hi>l.</hi> for the better proviſion for his ſaid Wife, or Portions for his Younger Children: Then the Queſtion will be how far this Mortgage may be made good in a Court of Equity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the ſeveral circumſtances that attend the Caſe: For firſt, if Mr. <hi>Edward Villers</hi> had Mortgaged the Eſtate for any Summ for the Maintenance of his Wife, that Money, when raiſed, had been in his own diſpoſal, there being no proviſion to the contrary, in the Deed produced to the Committee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> in that very produced Deed, Mr. <hi>Villers</hi> had power to grant Leaſes for Three Lives, or 41 Years, reſerving a Moiety of Rents uſually paid; Now this was giving ſuch a Power over the Eſtate, as might have Enabled him to Raiſe a much greater Summ, by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing Leaſes at one Halfe of the Rents, and if the Mortgage to Sir <hi>Theophilus,</hi> had been by Leaſe of the whole Eſtate, reſerving but a Moiety of the Rent, it had been a good Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and he might have enjoyed the Eſtate ſubject to the proviſoe, perſuant to the Power in ſuch produced Settlement.</p>
            <p>But beſides all this, Mr. <hi>Villers</hi> by his Will, in which he Chargeth the Eſtate with 12000 <hi>l.</hi> gives 2000 <hi>l.</hi> thereof to his Wife, beſides ſuch of the Childrens Portions as ſhould Die before they became Payable: Now certainly this 2000 <hi>l.</hi> ought to be Accounted as part of his Perſonal Eſtate, to pay a Creditor, where there is no other Aſſetts.</p>
            <p>Now, if the Creditors of <hi>Hornby</hi> can(as they are Adviſed they may) be Releived in a Court of <hi>Equity</hi> upon this Mortgage, which is ſince legally Aſſigned, and Conveyed to Truſtees for their Benifit, <hi>'Its humbly hoped this Honourable Houſe, in caſe they Paſs this Bill, will make proviſion f<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> The Creditors of <hi>Hornby,</hi> were never heard upon the matter, when the Bill was before the Lords, or had any Notice thereof, till the ſame was in the Printed <hi>Votes.</hi>
