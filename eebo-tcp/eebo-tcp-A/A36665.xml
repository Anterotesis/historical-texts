            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To a NEW PLAY, Call'd,
The Disappointment:
OR,
The Mother in Fashion.</head>
            <head type="sub">Spoken by Mr. BETTERTON.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>HOW comes it, Gentlemen, that now aday's</l>
               <l>When all of you so shrewdly judge of Plays,</l>
               <l>Our Poets tax you still with want of Sence?</l>
               <l>All Prologues treat you at your own Expence.</l>
               <l>Sharp Citizens a wiser way can go;</l>
               <l>They make you Fools, but never call you so.</l>
               <l>They, in good Manners, seldom make a Slip,</l>
               <l>But, Treat a Common Whore with Ladyship:</l>
               <l>But here each sawcy Wit at Random, writes,</l>
               <l>And uses Ladies as he use's Knights.</l>
               <l>Our Author, Young, and Grateful in his Nature,</l>
               <l>Vow's, that from him no Nymph deserves a Satyr.</l>
               <l>Nor will he ever Draw—I mean his Rhime,</l>
               <l>Against the sweet Partaker of his Crime.</l>
               <l>Nor is he yet so bold an Undertaker</l>
               <l>To call MEN Fools, 'tis Railing at their MAKER.</l>
               <l>Besides, he fears to split upon that Shelf;</l>
               <l>He's young enough to be a FOPP himself.</l>
               <l>And, if his Praise can bring you all A-bed,</l>
               <l>He swears such hopeful Youth no Nation ever bred.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Your Nurses, we presume, in such a Case,</l>
               <l>Your Father chose, because he lik'd the Face;</l>
               <l>And, often, they supply'd your Mothers place.</l>
               <l>The Dry Nurse was your Mothers ancient Maid,</l>
               <l>Who knew some former Slip she ne're betray'd.</l>
               <l>Betwixt 'em both, for Milk and Sugar Candy,</l>
               <l>Your sucking Bottles were well stor'd with Brandy.</l>
               <l>Your Father to initiate your Discourse</l>
               <l>Meant to have taught you first to Swear and Curse;</l>
               <l>But was prevented by each careful Nurse.</l>
               <l>For, leaving Dad and Mam, as Names too common,</l>
               <l>They taught you certain parts of Man and Woman.</l>
               <l>I pass your Schools, for there when first you came,</l>
               <l>You wou'd be sure to learn the Latin name.</l>
               <l>In Colledges you scorn'd their Art of thinking,</l>
               <l>But learn'd all Moods and Figures of good Drinking:</l>
               <l>Thence, come to Town you practise Play, to know</l>
               <l>The Vertues of the High Dice, and the Low.</l>
               <l>Each thinks himself a SHARPER most profound:</l>
               <l>He cheats by Pence; is cheated by the Pound:</l>
               <l>With these Perfections, and what else he Gleans,</l>
               <l>The SPARK sets up for Love behind our Scenes;</l>
               <l>Hot in pursuit of Princesses and Queens.</l>
               <l>There, if they know their Man, with cunning Carriage,</l>
               <l>Twenty to one but it concludes in Marriage.</l>
               <l>He hires some Homely Room, Love's Fruits to gather,</l>
               <l>And, Garret-high, Rebels against his Father.</l>
               <l>But he once dead—</l>
               <l>Brings her in Triumph, with her Portion down,</l>
               <l>A Twillet, Dressing-Box, and Half a Crown.</l>
               <l>Some Marry first, and then they fall to Scowring,</l>
               <l>Which is, Refining Marriage into Whoring.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:56211:2"/>
Our Women batten well on their good Nature,</l>
               <l>All they can rap and rend for the dear Creature.</l>
               <l>But while abroad so liberal the DOLT is,</l>
               <l>Poor SPOUSE at Home as Ragged as a Colt is.</l>
               <l>Last, some there are, who take their first Degrees</l>
               <l>Of Lewdness, in our Middle Galleries:</l>
               <l>The Doughty BULLIES enter Bloody Drunk,</l>
               <l>Invade and grubble one another's PUNK:</l>
               <l>They Caterwaul, and make a dismal Rout,</l>
               <l>Call SONS of WHORES, and strike, but ne're lugg-out:</l>
               <l>Thus while for <hi>Paultry Punk</hi> they roar and stickle,</l>
               <l>They make it <hi>Bawdier</hi> than a CONVENTICLE.</l>

            <l>YOU saw our Wife was Chaste, yet throughly try'd,</l>
            <l>And, without doubt, y'are hugely edify'd;</l>
            <l>For, like our Heroe, whom we shew'd to day,</l>
            <l>You think no Woman true, but in a Play;</l>
            <l>Love once did make a pretty kind of Show,</l>
            <l>Esteem and Kindness in one Breast wou'd grow,</l>
            <l>But 'twas Heav'n knows how many years ago.</l>
            <l>Now some small Chatt, and Guinney Expectation,</l>
            <l>Gets all the pretty Creatures in the Nation:</l>
            <l>In Comedy, your Little Selves you meet;</l>
            <l>'Tis <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> drawn in <hi>Bridges-street.</hi>

            <l>Ah! Happy you, with Ease and with Delight,</l>
            <l>Who act those Follies, Poets toil to write!</l>
            <l>The sweating Muse does almost leave the Chace,</l>
            <l>She puffs, and hardly keeps your <hi>Protean</hi> Vices pace.</l>
            <l>Pinch you but in one Vice, away you fly</l>
            <l>To some new Frisk of Contrariety.</l>
            <l>You rowle like Snow-Balls, gathering as you run,</l>
            <l>And get seven Dev'ls, when dispossess'd of one.</l>
            <l>Your <hi>Venus</hi> once was a <hi>Platonique</hi> Queen,</l>
            <l>Nothing of Love beside the Face was seen;</l>
            <l>But every Inch of Her you now Uncase,</l>
            <l>And clap a Vizard-Masque upon the Face.</l>
            <l>For Sins like these, the Zealous of the Land,</l>
            <l>With Little Hair, and Little or no Band,</l>

            <l>But for the Pit Confounders, let 'em go,</l>
            <l>And find as little Mercy as they show:</l>
