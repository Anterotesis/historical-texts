            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ere it not that Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> had received the Character of Mr. <hi>Poole,</hi> to be a <hi>confident</hi> and <hi>reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs</hi> man in his way, he ſhould have very much wondred to have found him publiſhing a
new <hi>Vindication</hi> of his Deſign, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> really believed the <hi>ſtrength</hi> and <hi>reaſon</hi> of his former <hi>Paper,</hi> in Anſwer to what Mr.<hi>Poole</hi> and all his <hi>Friends</hi> were able before to ſay, would have ſatisfied, and once more <hi>ſilenced</hi> him, and ſaved both parties the farther trouble of multiplying Replies upon the preſent Difference. But ſince Mr.<hi>Poole</hi> has again gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to abuſe the World with a <hi>ſecond</hi> Paper, which he calls by the <hi>ſame name</hi> as he did his former, (and well he may ſo doe, ſince it conſiſts in ſo great meaſure of mere vain and needleſs <hi>Repetitions</hi> of what he had <hi>formerly</hi> written, and what Mr.<hi>Bee</hi> had <hi>formerly</hi> as fully anſwered; the reſt of it being made up of notorious <hi>Falſities, Miſtakes</hi> wilfull or of Ignorance, ſomething of <hi>Abſurditie,</hi> an impertinent Flaſh or two of <hi>Wit,</hi> and <hi>Confidence</hi> more then ſufficient through the whole) Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved not to be behind-hand with him in juſtifying his Right and Propriety, and therefore to Mr.<hi>Poole</hi>'s Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Vindication</hi> returns this <hi>Anſwer,</hi> (if at leaſt any <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> will paſs with Mr.<hi>Poole</hi> for an <hi>Anſwer.</hi>)</p>
            <p>1. For his firſt Clauſe, of conſulting with <hi>able Lawyers,</hi> and receiving their Judgement <hi>in favour</hi> of his <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign;</hi> Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> thinks he hath ſufficiently anſwered that already; that one Story may be good till another be heard, that <hi>he</hi> hath alſo the Judgement of very <hi>able Lawyers againſt</hi> the <hi>Deſign,</hi> and that if Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> himſelf were fairly and fully to ſtate the Caſe to thoſe very Gentlemen named by Mr. <hi>Poole,</hi> he nothing doubts but, upon a clear ſight of the Pretenſions and Grounds on both ſides, they would be ready to entertain favourable thoughts to his Right in the Buſineſs controverted.</p>
            <p>2. For Mr. <hi>Poole</hi>'s Offer to refer all to <hi>Arbitration,</hi> &amp;c. and Mr. <hi>Bee</hi>'s Refuſall; Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> has confeſſed it, and given a Reaſon for it ſufficiently good to ſatisfie any Rational man. For the <hi>grand Abſurdity</hi> Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> is guilty of, neither Mr.<hi>Bee</hi> nor any body elſe can tell where it lies. Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> ſaies, It was not to be referr'd whether the <hi>CRITICI SACRI</hi> were Mr. <hi>Bee</hi>'s; but what Right Mr.<hi>Bee</hi> had in Mr. <hi>Poole</hi>'s <hi>Collections</hi> out of <hi>them</hi> and <hi>many others.</hi> Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> anſwers, that Mr. <hi>Poole</hi>'s <hi>Collections</hi> out of the CRITICKS were Mr. <hi>Bee</hi>'s juſt Right, as being his <hi>Authours in part;</hi> and for his <hi>many others,</hi> they could be no ground of any <hi>Reference,</hi> ſince he never laid Claim to them, nor had any thing to ſay to them. So that Mr. <hi>Bee</hi>'s <hi>Authours in part</hi> (which Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> calls his <hi>Collections</hi>) were the thing to be <hi>referr'd,</hi> whether they were Mr. <hi>Poole</hi>'s or Mr. <hi>Bee</hi>'s Right. And where now lies the <hi>Abſurdity?</hi> Whereas Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> ſaies he offered an <hi>Equivalent,</hi> a greater proportion of <hi>Materials,</hi> and I know not how much <hi>Care</hi> and <hi>Pains</hi> in <hi>contriving</hi> and <hi>digeſting</hi> the <hi>whole:</hi> Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> anſwers; for his <hi>Pains</hi> he may thank himſelf, if he would be buſier then he needed, and run his Plow into another man's Ground upon his own head. What his <hi>Care</hi> was, Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> knows not; but when Mr.<hi>Bee</hi> ſhall have knock'd off Mr. <hi>Poole</hi>'s fingers from meddling at all with his CRITICKS, and Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> ſhall have given his <hi>Subſcribers</hi> two or three more ſuch <hi>Slurrs</hi> as he has done by quitting the <hi>Biblia Maxima,</hi> one of his beſt <hi>Materials,</hi> which he formerly promiſed to bring in, but <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ow declares he will let alone, (ſo that they know not what they pay their Money for) Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> thinks by that time he may have his <hi>Labour for his Care and Pains.</hi> For the reſt of his <hi>Materials</hi> Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> knows not what they are: but were they of never ſo much worth and credit, when Mr.<hi>Bee</hi> ſaies he'll have nothing to doe with them, and Mr. <hi>Poole</hi>'s other <hi>colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> are his own already, how can Mr.<hi>Bee</hi> or any man elſe look upon this as an <hi>Equivalent?</hi> So that Mr.<hi>Bee</hi> goes on to declare, that Mr.<hi>Poole</hi> may as well religiouſly <hi>Epitomize</hi> his <hi>Purſe</hi> upon the High-way, as goe about by theſe crooked and ſiniſter Artifices to extort his unqueſtionable Right out of his hands, and all (as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends) for the <hi>Glory of God.</hi> That Mr.<hi>Bee</hi> never <hi>choſe</hi> above <hi>one</hi> perſon to any <hi>Meeting,</hi> and <hi>that one</hi> declar'd himſelf unſatisfied with Mr.<hi>Poole</hi>'s Profer, Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> again affirms. And whereas Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> threatens never to offer the like Terms again; Mr.<hi>Bee</hi> cannot help it, but deſires Mr.<hi>Poole</hi> not to trouble his head about that, till ſuch time as he ſhall ſend to him, and beg ſuch a Favour of him.</p>
            <p>3. For Mr. <hi>Bee</hi>'s <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs,</hi> and his bringing down the <hi>Prices</hi> of Books to the loſs and prejudice of many Scholars, (if there be <hi>any</hi> ſo prejudiced) there needs no new Anſwer. But whereas Mr.<hi>Poole</hi> ſaies, If theſe Loſſes and Injuries be expiated by the Serviceableneſs of Mr.<hi>Bee</hi>'s Deſign to the publick good, why may not he have the benefit of the ſame Plea? Mr.<hi>Bee</hi> anſwers, Becauſe Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> has not that true and juſt <hi>Title</hi> to the Copies he pretends to as himſelf had. For Mr.<hi>Bee</hi> meddled with no Authours that any <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
could claim a Right in, without firſt making them <hi>Satisfaction:</hi> But Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> declares to take his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Materials out of thoſe Authours that Mr.<hi>Bee</hi> has made himſelf a Legal Title in, and that without his <hi>Leave</hi> or <hi>Conſent,</hi> or any <hi>Conſideration</hi> for them. Let Mr.<hi>Poole</hi> but keep his own ground, and not treſpaſs upon the CRITICKS, and let his <hi>Epitomizing</hi> bring down the <hi>prices</hi> of what Authours he will.</p>
            <p>4. To his fourth Clauſe, (which is moſt of it <hi>Crambe</hi>) concerning one man's <hi>Epitomizing</hi> anothe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> Copy without being <hi>queſtion'd</hi> for it, (as Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> ſaies) Mr.<hi>Bee</hi> gives his former Anſwer, That Mr.<hi>Poole</hi> will find no Book in <hi>England,</hi> of one ſort or other, (before the <hi>Parliament</hi> 1642) printed either <hi>in whole</hi> or <hi>part,</hi> but either by the right <hi>Owner,</hi> or with his <hi>Conſent</hi> and <hi>Approbation;</hi> and the like in any forein <hi>ſettled</hi> Kingdome, State, or Principality. What things have been <hi>here</hi> ſince done to the contrary, have been done beſide Law

and Reaſon. And if ſome men in thoſe <hi>Arbitrary</hi> and <hi>Licencious</hi> times have not been able to help themſelves againſt <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers,</hi> their caſe was to be <hi>pitied,</hi> rather then drawn into <hi>Example.</hi> But if any true Proprietors will in <hi>theſe daies</hi> either wink at other men while they pick their Pockets, or be negligent of their own Intereſts, when they have the Law open to defend and juſtifie them, or think it not worth their while to <hi>ſue a Beggar and catch Vermine,</hi> or it may be have taken <hi>Compoſition</hi> under-hand, (all which are at leaſt <hi>tacit Conſents</hi>) why ſhould this ſway any thing with Mr. <hi>Bee,</hi> who never made over the leaſt of his Right, nor any way allow'd another to meddle with it, but is reſolved (by God's aſſiſtence) to try what the Law will doe for him, which as it is the great <hi>Diſcerner,</hi> ſo the <hi>Securer</hi> of all mens <hi>Proprieties?</hi> For <hi>Marlorat</hi>'s <hi>Epitome,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> again averrs, that it was printed at the Charge of the ſame Bookſellers that had the Propriety in the Authours he <hi>Epitomized,</hi> and printed by the very ſame Printer. Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> ſaies, he that looks on the Title-pages of thoſe Authours will find this a mere <hi>Fiction</hi> of Mr. <hi>Bee.</hi> But let Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> look on the Title-pages of the <hi>firſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions</hi> of thoſe Authours, (not thoſe <hi>after-Impreſſions</hi> in other Countries which lay out of the bounds of their <hi>Privileges,</hi> and could no way be prevented, as Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> cannot prevent a Diſcourteſie of that nature to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Forein parts, and therefore had need to be ſecured by his <hi>Grant</hi> at home) Let Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> look on theſe, and he will ſoon find Mr. <hi>Bee</hi>'s Tale true, and the <hi>Fiction</hi> to lie at his own door. By that time Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> has ſerved an <hi>Apprenticeſhip</hi> to the Trade (as every Bookſeller ſhould) he will learn to make this diſtinction: but at preſent he is but <hi>raw</hi> and <hi>green</hi> in the way. That the <hi>Law-Patent-Caſe</hi> was determined by the Lord <hi>Keeper</hi> the <hi>laſt Term,</hi> (by which Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> muſt mean <hi>Hilary Term,</hi> for this is but the ſame <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntruth</hi> repeated, which he formerly printed in his firſt <hi>Paper</hi> a little after <hi>that Term</hi>) Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> wonders with what face Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> can perſiſt in ſo groſs and palpable a <hi>Falſity;</hi> when 'tis notoriouſly known that in that <hi>laſt</hi> Term (as he calls it) there was nothing like a <hi>Determination,</hi> but it was onely <hi>referr'd</hi> to a future Hearing the enſuing <hi>Eaſter term,</hi> that in that <hi>Term</hi> it was again heard, and again put off, and at this preſent <hi>Term</hi> continues undecided. This all the Town can tell him. Now what <hi>eminent Lawyer</hi> it was that ſhould ſo abuſe Mr. <hi>Poole,</hi> (if Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> does not rather abuſe his <hi>Lawyer</hi>) as to aſſure him he was preſent, and heard the Lord <hi>Keeper determine</hi> the Caſe, Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> cannot imagine, but takes the whole Story for a <hi>Caſtle</hi> built <hi>in the Air</hi> of Mr. <hi>Poole</hi>'s Fancy, as moſt of what he ſaies beſides ſeems to have had its firſt hatching and production there.</p>
            <p>5. Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> ſaies, he does not pretend to <hi>Epitomize</hi> the <hi>whole</hi> CRITICKS. Nor does Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> know how
it can be done: for can a man <hi>Epitomize,</hi> and yet take the <hi>whole?</hi> can he take but <hi>parts</hi> of a thing, and yet have <hi>all?</hi> However (as Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> ſaid formerly) he takes all that he judges the <hi>beſt,</hi> and makes moſt for his purpoſe; he takes the <hi>Kernell,</hi> and leaves the <hi>Shell</hi> to Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> for his <hi>Fifteen thouſand pound.</hi> No, ſaies Mr. <hi>Poole,</hi> there are many material things in them not belonging to <hi>Expoſition of Scripture,</hi> which are valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
another way. But what if Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> ſhould fall upon another <hi>Deſign</hi> hereafter, and then Collect out of them all that he now leaves behind, by the ſame Law and Reaſon that he now thinks to run away with ſo conſiderable a part of them? Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> remembers the Apologue of the old <hi>Fox</hi> and the young one. A ſorry <hi>Fox Epitomized</hi> a Flock of <hi>Geeſe,</hi> and brought home a couple of the <hi>fatteſt.</hi> The young ones laugh'd. At dinner ſaies one of them, Mother, they are excellent meat; but why did you bring no more of them? Peace, you fool, ſaies the old one, I have brought you home two of the <hi>beſt,</hi> and when occaſion ſerves I know where to find <hi>the reſt</hi> of them. So that Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> has no Security for the Remainder, and all that he has to thank Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> for is, his <hi>Reprieving</hi> the reſidue of his CRITICKS till his <hi>Luſt</hi> and <hi>Stomach</hi> be as ready for them as his <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> is.</p>

But this is certain at preſent, that the noiſe of Mr. <hi>Poole</hi>'s Project (with divers that did not well underſtand the true ſtate of Buſineſſes) has done him ſome manifeſt Diſſervice abroad, which Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> muſt bear as well as he can. And whereas Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> is ſo raſhly confident as to publiſh in print now a <hi>ſecond time </hi> that ſeveral of Mr. <hi>Bee</hi>'s <hi>Partners</hi> declare they will not joyn with him in a <hi>ſecond Impreſſion:</hi> why ſhould they <hi>declare</hi> ſo, when Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> had never <hi>propoſed</hi> the thing to them?

And yet they are groſsly
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98363:2"/>
wide in their Gueſſes, which are directly beſides Mr.<hi>Bee</hi>'s Reſolution, (if God permit) to go on as <hi>vigorouſly</hi> as Mr.<hi>Poole,</hi> according to the <hi>Pattern</hi> exhibited to the World in his late <hi>Specimen.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> ſays this Undertaking of Mr.<hi>Bee</hi> is a work of time, charge, and uncertainty. For the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertainty,</hi> Mr. <hi>Poole</hi>'s Deſign is equally ſubject to it; and more uncertain in this reſpect, that the <hi>Epitomizer</hi> himſelf ſeems to be ſo <hi>uncertain,</hi> as not yet to be well reſolved what to take in to his <hi>Doing,</hi> and what to leave out; whereas Mr. <hi>Bee</hi>'s whole <hi>Deſign</hi> is completed and digeſted. For Accidents and Caſualties they are common to both. For the <hi>Charge</hi> of it, let it not trouble Mr.<hi>Poole,</hi> it ſhall never coſt him a farthing. For the <hi>Time,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> hopes to carry it on with that convenient expedition, that poſſibly it may prevent Mr.<hi>Poole</hi>'s, and make a <hi>younger Brother</hi> of it, if it do not in the meanwhile prove <hi>Abortive,</hi> or ſtifled in the Wombe. And whereas Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> ſays he has a <hi>Privilege</hi> as well as Mr. <hi>Bee,</hi> and bears himſelf high upon that: Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> wonders upon the account of what <hi>Merit</hi> he procured it. But how-ever, he hopes Mr.<hi>Poole</hi> will conſider he is his <hi>ſenior</hi> in <hi>Privilege</hi> eight years, and that the Scene lies not in <hi>Kent,</hi> but in <hi>Middleſex,</hi> where <hi>Gavel-kind</hi>-Law has no footing, but the <hi>Elder</hi> has the advantage and priority of the reſt, that is, the <hi>Privilege.</hi> Both Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> and Mr.<hi>Poole</hi> can't have Right to the Eſtate. But if Mr. <hi>Bee</hi>'s <hi>Privilege</hi> will not hold water, and ſecure him from any attempt Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> can make upon his Propriety, what does Mr.<hi>Poole</hi> think will become of his, if any man ſhould go about in a <hi>mad</hi> humour to <hi>Epitomize</hi> part or <hi>whole</hi> (as he phraſes it) of his <hi>Deſign?</hi> If Mr. <hi>Bee's Privilege</hi> will doe no good, why ſhould Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> trouble himſelf to procure one, which may as well be undermined by another, and that by a third, and ſo Mr.<hi>Poole</hi> be reduced to the ſame condition as he endeavours to bring Mr.<hi>Bee</hi> into, ſmart by his own Rod, and be gull'd of his <hi>pretended</hi> Right after his own Example?</p>
            <p>To the ſecond part; Whereas Mr.<hi>Poole</hi> inſtances in ſeveral Authours <hi>Epitomized,</hi> as <hi>Baronius, Raleigh,</hi> &amp;c. which yet bear good rates in the World, and therefore Mr. <hi>Bee</hi>'s Clamours are groundleſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, that there are <hi>Epitomes</hi> which have been undertaken with ſo little diſcretion and judgement in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagery, that the Undertakers have been <hi>laugh'd at</hi> and <hi>hiſs'd off the Stage:</hi> and no wonder if thoſe Authours at large have kept their Advantage. But for others, <hi>Baronius</hi> for one, they have been manifeſtly obſtructed in their <hi>ſales</hi> and <hi>rates,</hi> ſays the <hi>old Book-ſeller,</hi> what-ever Mr.<hi>Poole,</hi> (who is yet but a <hi>Pretender</hi> to the Trade) may ſay to the contrary. But is there any Authour ſo <hi>martyred</hi> as Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> threatens to ſerve Mr.<hi>Bee</hi>'s, and yet <hi>lives?</hi> He pretends to <hi>drain</hi> and <hi>ſuck</hi> all the <hi>marrow</hi> and <hi>heart-bloud</hi> out of the CRITICKS, all that tends any way to the <hi>underſtanding of difficult places of Scripture,</hi> which is the whole <hi>Deſign</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> of Mr.<hi>Bee</hi>'s nine Volumes? Mr.<hi>Poole</hi> ſays, Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> did formerly declare that ſuch a <hi>synopſis</hi> as Mr.<hi>Poole</hi>'s would not prejudice his Work. If Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> means the <hi>Synopſis</hi> as he has now contriv'd it, to conſiſt two Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes in three out of his Work, there's no man can believe Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> ſo <hi>ſenſleſs</hi> as to expreſs himſelf to any ſuch purpoſe. All that he ſaid was, if Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> meddled not with his CRITICKS, or if his Deſign were as he firſt repreſented it to Mr.<hi>Bee,</hi> it would not be ſo prejudicial: but ſince he has declared to take one <hi>whole Volume,</hi> and another time no leſs then <hi>two,</hi> out of them, the caſe is alter'd, and Mr.<hi>Bee</hi> muſt not be underſtood to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare a thing ſo manifeſtly tending to his own ruine. Whereas Mr.<hi>Poole</hi> twits Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> with his conceit of <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Profit</hi> which may accrue to him, does not Mr.<hi>Poole</hi> expect the like in his Undertaking? and what may Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> think of <hi>him,</hi> who has the <hi>real profit</hi> and advantage of his <hi>subſcription-money</hi> for ſome moneths at leaſt, if his Deſign goes no farther on?</p>
            <p>Having gone thus far, Mr.<hi>Poole</hi> propoſes two ſmart Caſes, which if Mr.<hi>Bee</hi> thought it worth the while he would anſwer. To the firſt of them he ſays onely this, That if Mr.<hi>Poole</hi> will bring his <hi>imaginary</hi> Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and Learned <hi>Doctour</hi> out of the <hi>Clouds,</hi> where he ſuppoſes him to live, and procure a Meeting betwixt Mr.<hi>Bee</hi> and him, Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> will give him a ſatisfactory Anſwer to the wild <hi>Quere</hi> Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> makes on his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, (whether he may not print a <hi>Collection</hi> gathered out of ſeveral other as well as Mr. <hi>Bee</hi>'s Authours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he printed them, (divers of which latter neither Mr.<hi>Poole</hi> nor his <hi>learned Doctour</hi> had ever ſeen or heard of, had not they found them in the CRITICKS) print this <hi>Collection,</hi> I ſay, which he made for his own <hi>private uſe:</hi>) but till then Mr.<hi>Bee</hi> will give neither him nor Mr.<hi>Poole</hi> leave to tamper with any thing that has ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate a relation to himſelf by way of Propriety.</p>
            <p>The other, of Epitomizing <hi>Speed,</hi> &amp;c. (which Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> ſaies is exactly <hi>his</hi> Caſe) is as ſhallow: But the main thing that Mr.<hi>Bee</hi> obſerves by Mr. <hi>Poole</hi>'s <hi>ramble,</hi> from the CRITICKS, to <hi>Law-Books,</hi> from them to <hi>Dictionaries,</hi> to <hi>Hiſtorians,</hi> to one thing after another, is this, that Mr.<hi>Poole</hi>'s aim is for the <hi>levelling</hi> of <hi>all Propriety</hi> in any ſorts of Books whatſoever: and if he be not well obſerved in his preſent motion, he (or ſome
other of his Friends that now <hi>lie fallow</hi> and have leiſure enough) may ere long attempt farther in ſubjects of another nature, eſpecially if he once finde himſelf of ſtrength to deal with Mr.<hi>Bee</hi> in the preſent Diſpute.</p>
            <p>But the thing that does moſt of all <hi>ſting</hi> and <hi>nettle</hi> Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> is Mr.<hi>Bee</hi>'s challenging him of <hi>breach</hi> of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> before his going into <hi>Holland,</hi> which was, that he would deſiſt in his Deſign till Mr. <hi>Bee</hi>'s return from thence. Here Mr.<hi>Poole</hi> is <hi>ſore</hi> and <hi>winces,</hi> and at laſt is ſo far carried as to ſay he is ready to contradict Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> with an <hi>Oath,</hi> (which it may be for all that he would not doe if he were put to it.) He ſays, had any ſuch <hi>Promiſe</hi> been made, Mr.<hi>Bee</hi> would have put it in his <hi>Firſt</hi> Paper. That Mr.<hi>Bee</hi> ſpared him then, was out of a reſpect he had to his <hi>Coat,</hi> (though Mr.<hi>Poole</hi>'s were never perfectly <hi>black</hi>) and the hope he had he ſhould have no occaſion to urge it. But <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> nothing elſe would ſerve the turn, Mr.<hi>Bee</hi> thought it f<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> to dally no longer, but to let the world know how <hi>unworthily</hi> Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> had dealt by him. So that it was no <hi>afternoon-dream,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Poole waggiſhly</hi> ſuggeſts, but a real <hi>Truth</hi> of ſome weeks ſtanding, though then firſt awak'd by Mr. <hi>Bee,</hi> to the confutation of Mr.<hi>Poole</hi>'s boaſt of his great <hi>Sincerity</hi> and <hi>Candour</hi> in this whole Tranſaction. But let Mr.<hi>Poole</hi> have a care, that notwithſtanding Mr. <hi>Bee</hi>'s <hi>afternoon-dream,</hi> he be not up time enough in the <hi>morning</hi> to meet him in the firſt full career of his <hi>vigorous proceeding,</hi> and take the boldneſs to bid him
<hi>Stand.</hi> For Mr. <hi>Bee</hi>'s good invention, let any man judge where the <hi>Invention</hi> lies, and who has the beſt

knack that way, by the ſeveral Weakneſſes Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> has been trapp'd in through this whole Paper hitherto. When Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> cites 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9. 11. Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> is afraid he is beſide the Text, and had turned down the wrong leaf, or that he prick'd with a Pin for it, as Boys do in a <hi>Lottery-Book;</hi> otherwiſe Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> thinks he might have as well cited the firſt verſe in <hi>Geneſis</hi> as that, for any thing that either the one or the other concerns the preſent buſineſs. But though Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> be a little obſcure here, yet by and by Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> queſtions not but to make the World <hi>know the man and his communication.</hi> How much more pertinent had it been for Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> to have turned to another Chapter? where he ſhould have found <hi>Ahab,</hi> a branded man for notorious impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet making Conſcience in the caſe of another's Vineyard, which he would not ſeize upon either in whole or part without firſt profering an equivalent Compenſation? But as to Mr. <hi>Poole</hi>'s <hi>Promiſe</hi> in <hi>Jewin Street,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> is ready to ſwear, that it was given, and for 3 months, with thoſe circumſtances which he has rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his former Paper. And though it had the fortune to be a <hi>private</hi> and <hi>unwitneſſed</hi> Tranſaction, (as Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> ſaies, who has otherwhile told Mr. <hi>Bee,</hi> that if a <hi>third</hi> man ſhould at any time come amongſt them, he would hold no diſcourſe of the buſineſs in difference betwixt them) yet Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> has ſufficient <hi>witneſs,</hi> that after his Return from <hi>Holland,</hi> this Paſſage was betwixt Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> and him in his Shop. Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> there in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe taxed Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> with faileur in his Promiſe made before he went over. Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> then, as now, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied any ſuch Promiſe. What was it then, Mr. <hi>Poole,</hi> ſaid Mr. <hi>Bee,</hi> that you and I talked of ſo long together in <hi>Jewin street?</hi> Was it not about my buſineſs? And was there nothing of a Promiſe mention'd? Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> at laſt ingenuouſly confeſs'd he promiſed for <hi>three weeks.</hi> This was over-heard and ready to be atteſted by one then at a little diſtance from us. Now Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> leaves it to others to judge, the onely <hi>ground</hi> of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> being his neceſſary occaſion of abſence in the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> about his Concerns, which he then told Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> would require <hi>three months</hi> time; whether it were to any purpoſe for Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> to promiſe, or Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> to accept the Promiſe for <hi>three weeks,</hi> which was all one as if there had been no Promiſe at all; and whether it be not probable (there being a Promiſe made) it was rather for the whole term Mr. <hi>Bee</hi>'s Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions required; who, had it not been that he had thought himſelf ſecure during his being abroad upon Mr. <hi>Poole</hi>'s word paſſed, had at leaſt <hi>deferr'd</hi> his Voiage till ſome time after. But Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> grows warm, and ſaies he is ready to make Oath before a Magiſtrate that he made no ſuch Promiſe. Though Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> is not a little pleaſed to find Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> ſo far coming on, that at length he can perſuade himſelf to be willing to take ſome kind of Oath upon ſome occaſion; yet for him, who, after ſome boggling, at laſt refuſed and ſtill ſtands out againſt a <hi>Subſcription</hi> tendered from the great Authority of the Nation, tending ſo much to the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the quiet and peace of the Nation, for <hi>him</hi> to make his firſt Eſſay of Swearing in a Caſe tending to his own private profit and advantage, to the manifeſt Detriment of his neighbour, and where Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident the Truth ſtands againſt him; Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> deſires him to conſider whether there be not ſomething of his own <hi>Gnat</hi> and <hi>Camel</hi> in the caſe.</p>
            <p>For Mr. <hi>Bee</hi>'s ſpreading a Report, that Mr. <hi>Poole</hi>'s Work was ſtopp'd; Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> gives this ſhort Anſwer in Mr. <hi>Poole</hi>'s ear: <hi>'Tis falſe.</hi> But if any employ'd by Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> to diſperſe his <hi>Specimens</hi> ſhould accidentally glean up ſuch a ſtory in the <hi>Coffee-houſe,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> cannot help it, nor is he bound to anſwer what people ſay in that <hi>prattling School.</hi> How could Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> goe about to raiſe ſuch a Report, when he knew in his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence he neve<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> had mov'd the leaſt ſtep towards the <hi>ſtopping</hi> of it? For as long as Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> was but onely words and Preparations, Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> never troubled himſelf to meddle with him, or by any Application extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary to diſturb him; neit<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er is he a man of that temper, to impound his neighbour's Cattel till he take them <hi>Damage-feaſant.</hi> Now, is his time to <hi>ſtop</hi> him; and it may be Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> may ſoon find it more then a <hi>Report.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in the mean while, who raiſed the Report both in the City and Univerſities, that Mr. <hi>Bee</hi>'s friends need not make ſuch a ſtir about Mr. <hi>Poole</hi>'s unjuſt and hard dealing with Mr. <hi>Bee,</hi> for Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> was well ſatisfied by Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> in the buſineſs? Certainly this muſt be either Mr. <hi>Poole</hi>'s doing, (the ſtory is ſo falſe) or Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> knows not where to look the Authour; it being probable no unintereſted perſon would concern himſelf to hammer out ſuch a notorious invention. It muſt therefore be at leaſt a <hi>Sharer</hi> in the <hi>Synopſis of Criticall and other Commentators</hi> that firſt contrived it, as Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> is well aſſured it was firſt publiſhed and maintained in the above-named talking <hi>Academy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, let Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> reſt content with what is his own, and leave Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> to diſpoſe as he thinks good of what is <hi>his;</hi> let him leave out the <hi>Critical,</hi> and retain his <hi>other Commentators:</hi> if then Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to cite here and there a paſſage out of Mr. <hi>Bee</hi>'s Authours, (for confirmation of the Subject he treats on, as he may a Text of Scripture in a Sermon, according to the Judgement of one of his Lawyers) Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> ſhall not be againſt it, provided he do it <hi>civilly</hi> and <hi>modeſtly;</hi> for Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> does not love he ſhould cite <hi>all</hi> his Book thus <hi>at a time.</hi> But if a <hi>Synopſis</hi> be a Beaſt of that nature, to hook and fang in all that lies within its reach for its Maſter's advantage, Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> thinks it not fit to be endured in a Commonwealth where <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum</hi> are in faſhion. It is yet in Mr. <hi>Poole</hi>'s power for him and Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> to part friends, the fault is elſe at <hi>his</hi> door: but in caſe Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> proceeds in his perverſe humour, Mr. <hi>Bee</hi> is reſolved (with God's help) to make uſe of thoſe Remedies which are proper for the Diſeaſe, and to endeavour by the beſt Art he can to put a ſtop to Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> in his unreaſonable proceedings.</p>
