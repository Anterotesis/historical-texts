         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A few Lines in True Love TO THE <hi>Inhabitants</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> Eſpecially this <hi>Great CITY</hi> of <hi>LONDON,</hi> who are called <hi>CHRISTIANS.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>DEar People, many are ſo called, that have not yet conſidered the end of Chriſt in his coming, who came not to call the Righteous, but Sinners to Repentance; therefore to you that are in that State, his Call is yet extended, that you may now conſider while you have time, leſt any or many of you ſhould prove of that number that hates to be Reformed, but will ſtill perſiſt to go on in Pride and Wickedneſs to Deſtruction, provoking the Righteous God to Anger, who is angry with the Wicked every day; then conſider how many Days, Months, and Years, ſome of this Generation hath been kindling the Anger of the Lord, which in his hot Diſpleaſure (if it ſhould break forth) will be terrible to the Workers of Iniquity: Therefore, let ſuch Repent, and ſeek the Lord while he is to be found in Mercy, or otherwiſe he may be ſeen in Judgment; and therefore all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare and ſeek the Lord, Oh Inhabitants of <hi>England</hi>; Profeſſor and Prophane, for you the Lord hath often viſited, with the Tenders of his Love, by and through his Son Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, who gave himſelf a Ranſom for all Mankind, that he might Redeem them out of that State in which the Lord was diſpleaſed with them: Therefore, conſider all you who bear the Name of Chriſtians; but too many are ſtill found out of that pure peaceable Spirit of Truth and Righteouſneſs, that Chriſt Jeſus left an Enſample of, but many have been, and ſtill are Reſiſting his Spiritual Appearance, which is the way that God hath appointed for Man's Salvation and Reſtauration out of that Fallen State of Deprivation, in which he is Separated from the Glory of his Power, and the Belief of the Benefit they may receive there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; through which we ſee by woful Experience, That the Spirit of Antichriſt hath prevailed over Nations, Kindreds, Tongues and People; but the Lord hath looked and beheld their <hi>Babel-Buildings,</hi> although their Tops have ſeemed to reach to Heaven; he will confound the wiſe Builders, and bring to nought the Underſtandings of the Prudent Profeſſors of his Worthy Name, who will not bow to the Yoak and Croſs of our Lord and Saviour Chriſt Jeſus, by which they may come to live that Righteous Life which doth beſpeak his Glory and his Fame: Therefore, Dear People, all conſider while there is a day of Mercy yet extended, and remember what Severity hath been ſhown to other Nations and Places<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and forget not how the Lord doth yet ſpare you, and lengthen out the day of your Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to ſee, if by any means, that may work a Reformation from thoſe Evil Corruptions that do abound in the Nation; and O how ready People are to forget both Mercies and Judgments which the Lord hath often mixed in, and to the City of <hi>London</hi>; therefore it is high time now to conſider and Remember to be Wiſe, and depart from Iniquity, which is of many kinds; and forſake all thoſe crying ſins that do abound, for the Call of the Lord is come out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> partake not of her Sins, leſt you ſhould partake of her Plagues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and alſo remember his Gracious Call hath been extended many ways: How gently did the Lord lately ſhake the Earth, as many know, that People might hear and fear before him, the Great Almighty Powerful God, who will not only ſhake the Earth, but the Heavens alſo; For he will <hi>not hold them guiltleſs that take his Name in vain</hi>: Therefore, Dear People, once more hear and fear, and prepare to meet the Lord; that if happily you may obtain farther Mercy from the Gracious long-Suffering God, who can afford us Peace and Plenty, if Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will love him and forſake Iniquity, which is of abſolute neceſſity for all that deſire <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> Proſperity, and the good of their own Souls.</p>
