         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In any ordinary trade, before a man can bee acquainted with the ſecrets of it, you bind him Apprentice for ſix or ſeven yeares; truly, there are ſo many myſteries in Religion, that require the ſervice of divers Apprentiſhips to bee well acquainted with them.

Therefore you ſhall find in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 2. the Lord tells you, <hi>I have ſpread out my hands all the day long to a rebellious people,</hi> that <hi>walke in a way that is not good, after their own thoughts.</hi> There is not a man or woman in this Congregation, that hath out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the miniſtery all this while, and per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now when you are come to this reſolution, My own thoughts ſhall not guide mee, my own way cannot ſave mee; but I will apply my ſelfe to Gods way; this is the firſt ſtep towards walking; This is preſuppoſed indeed, before you can walke in this good way, it muſt be done.

            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:111108:17"/>Secondly, Walking is a <hi>moving forward,</hi> taking ſtep after ſtep, as travellers uſe to doe, ſo that you make <hi>ſome progreſſe:</hi> Though you<note place="margin">2 Walking im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a progreſs in the good way.</note> bee in the right way, yet if you ſtand ſtill, you doe not walke; But in that you hold compliance with the Commandements of God, and go along with them, maintaining a correſpondency to Gods will, this is walking.</p>

Gods people are <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntiers,</hi> a <hi>willing people:</hi> And the very tenor of the Covenant is this,<note place="margin">Pſal. 110. 3.</note> Gods people ſhould bee a <hi>repenting</hi> people, a <hi>beleeving</hi> people, an <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying</hi> people.

            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:111108:18"/>After the diſcovery of the nature of this <hi>walking,</hi> the next thing is, what <hi>Reſt</hi> is here offered: Here is a plaiſter every way as broad<note place="margin">VVhat Soule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refreſhing reſt to be found by walking in the good way. 1 Reſt from ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> as the wound, a ſatisfaction proportionable to the exigents and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of poore travellers towards <hi>Canaan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Reſt from terrours of Conſcience:</hi> Sometimes a Servant of God lyeth under ſuch, and thoſe are ſad and blacke troubles indeed, to bee under the accuſing of a condemning conſcience; you need not diſpute <hi>where hell is,</hi> for they that know what terrours of conſcience meane, they will tell you. <hi>God can make a Hell in a mans boſome, in his heart;</hi> if any ſpark of <hi>Gods wrath fall on Conſcience, there is an Hell.</hi> Who giveth reſt from theſe terrours of conſcience? God himſelfe, hee being ſatisfyed by the blood of Chriſt, can eaſily ſatisfie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; If <hi>our owne hearts condemne us, 1 Joh.</hi> 3. 20. God is <hi>greater then our hearts, who knoweth all things.</hi> Oh, it is a ſad thing, when wee have a condemning conſcience. Our blind conſciences know but little evill by our ſelves, in compariſon of what God ſees, and if that condemne us, what will God doe then, that is much greater then our conſciences, and knoweth all things? On the other ſide, If <hi>our conſcience condemne us not, then have wee confidence towards God,</hi> as it is there expreſſed, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. Here is heaven on earth, here is ſweet reſt, walking in the <hi>good way,</hi> thou haſt a <hi>good conſcience, purity</hi> is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy way to <hi>Peace;</hi> When thou haſt a conſcience that doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne thee, but a conſcience that doth abſolve thee, and a conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that doth approve thee, a conſcience that is ſprinkled with the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, then haſt thou confidence towards God, ſuch a ſoule dares come to <hi>Prayer</hi> with boldneſſe, and come to <hi>Gods Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> with confidence, ſuch a ſoule is not afraid of <hi>death,</hi> nor terrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with thoughts of the day of <hi>Judgement.</hi> If all bee well at home, it argues all is well in Heaven, if conſcience bee at peace upon good grounds, then thou mayeſt bee ſure God is at peace. Here is ſweet Reſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as there is reſt from <hi>terrours of conſcience,</hi> ſo there is<note place="margin">2 Reſt from ſcruples and feares in our minds.</note> 
               <hi>reſt from ſcruples, and doubts, and feares.</hi> Sometimes though the mind lye not under ſuch <hi>Helliſh terrours,</hi> yet it is in a ſad, dejected, ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous, unſetled condition, knoweth not what to doe, nor what courſe to take. Conſcience is a tender part: a little bit of gravell in a narrow ſhoo, oh! it will much pinch and trouble the foot; and ſo a little ſcruple in conſcience, much perplexeth the ſpirit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:111108:18"/>
               <hi>Scruples</hi> are indeed like <hi>Thiſtles,</hi> though very bad weeds themſelves, yet they argue the ground to bee good where they grow: in many honeſt hearts there may bee abundance of them.

Sometimes a poore Soule that goes to prayer, hanging the wing, in a drooping eſtate, God breakes in upon him in prayer, and hee goeth out of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, as one in another world; Why, God hath given him reſt, and God hath met him, walking in the good way, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded thoſe ſcruples and feares that did poſſeſſe him; <hi>Through cuſtome of doing againſt ſuch like ſcruples, conſcience it ſelfe is made more ſtrong and ſetled.</hi>

The haters of the Lord ſhould have ſubmitted themſelves unto him; but their time ſhould have indured for ever: England</hi> as well as <hi>Iſrael</hi> might obtaine victory over cruell and bloody enemies, could wee learn to walk in Gods wayes.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Reſt in <hi>Heaven.</hi> In <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 9. you find, there remaineth<note place="margin">5 Reſt in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</note> a <hi>reſt to the People of God.</hi> In this Chapter is mentioned a threefold reſt:</p>
            <p>Firſt, The reſt of the holy Sabbath, <hi>v.</hi> 4. (where diverſe obſerve a ſtrong Argument in the New Teſtament for the inſtitution of the Sabbath from the beginning.)</p>
            <p>Secondly, a Reſt of <hi>Canaan, v.</hi> 5. 8.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, A remaining reſt, a divine and heavenly reſt, from the troubles of this life, to live wholly <hi>to God, and with God;</hi> This is called a Reſt from labours, all the labour of this world that thou groaneſt under, <hi>Rev. 14. 13. Bleſſed are they that die in the Lord,</hi> or dye for the Lord, they ſhall <hi>reſt from their labours, and their works ſhall follow them;</hi> here you muſt bee Souldiers, you muſt ſerve out your generation in a conflicting courſe, you muſt labour night and day, God will have none of his ſervants idle, the time will come, when you ſhall have reſt from all your labours, and then all your good workes will follow you: many good workes thou haſt done, are now forgotten by thee, thou ſhalt heare of them then, at the day of<note place="margin">Mat. 25. 36. &amp;c.</note> judgement, they will then appeare: Jeſus Chriſt knowes more good by them, then they doe by themſelves, you did viſit me, you did refreſh mee when I was in priſon, and refreſh mee when I was hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and all theſe good works ſhall follow you, not a good worke you have done, not a good word you have ſpoken, but they ſhall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:111108:19"/>
you. Here is the happy reſt your ſoules ſhall find at your jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies end, having walked in this good way.</p>
            <p>It follows now that evidence bee produced, whereby it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that walking in this good way, is <hi>Gods Method</hi> to obtaine ſweet Soule-refreſhing Reſt.</p>
            <p>Here three conſiderations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That God who bids you <hi>Stand, ſee, and inquire</hi> after the<note place="margin">1.</note> good way, is a <hi>God of Peace, 1 Theſſ.</hi> 5. 23. who hath made known<note place="margin">Eviden<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s that walking in the good way leads to Reſt.</note> an unmoveable <hi>Covenant of peace, Iſa.</hi> 54. 10. Ingaging himſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to imbrace all thoſe who waite upon him in his own way. Yea, <hi>Iſa. 64. 5. The Lord meeteth him, who rejoyceth in righteouſneſſe, ſuch as remember him in his wayes.</hi> Walking in the good way, leads undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly to communion with God, and a ſweet injoyment of him. As in <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 20. When the Prodigall Sonne was a great way off, his Father ſaw him, and had compaſſion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kiſſed him; which diſcovers what God is ready to doe; to meet them with the deareſt imbraces who travell towards him in the good way.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Jeſus Chriſt is a <hi>Prince of Peace, Iſa.</hi> 9. 6. and in the<note place="margin">2.</note> Goſpel of Peace hath ſeriouſly invited all that are weary, and <hi>heavy laden,</hi> to come unto him, and <hi>hee will give them reſt, Matth.</hi> 11. 28. Yea, the Soule comming unto him in this good way finds peace and reſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1, 2. and ſuch peace in his Kingdome, and under his government, of which <hi>there ſhall bee no end, Iſa.</hi> 9. 7. Firſt, the Soule finde <hi>reſt in him,</hi> by <hi>reſting upon him,</hi> and <hi>then reſt with him for eternity:</hi> This Chriſt diſcovers to his Diſciples with much ſweet, ingenuous, loving faithfulneſſe, <hi>Joh. 14. 2, 3, 4. In my Fathers houſe are many Manſions: if it were not ſo, I would have told you; I goe to prepare a place for you. And if I goe and prepare a place for you, I will come againe, and receive you unto my ſelfe, that where I am, there yee may bee alſo. And whither I goe yee know, and the way yee know.</hi> The good way which hee hath preſcribed, will infallibly bring you unto it. Now ſome little joy <hi>enters into you</hi> by drops, the time is comming when you ſhall enter into <hi>your Maſters joy,</hi> dwelling in joy and reſt for ever; you are not ſo ready to come unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as hee is to come into <hi>you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, walking in the good way, will according to the very te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour<note place="margin">3.</note> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> undoubtedly lead you into <hi>the new and living way,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:111108:20"/>
Heb.</hi> 10. 20. into Jeſus Chriſt, and communion with him, who is the onely meanes of reconciling us unto God, and by him to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it ſelfe. This way to an eternall Reſt in the fruition of Gods incarnation, is indeed new. Firſt, comparatively, in regard of the more cleere manifeſting of the way to Heaven under the Goſpel. Secondly, new, becauſe it waxeth not old, it is now eſtabliſhed, and never to bee altered, and withall it is a living way; Herein Jeſus Chriſt is found, who is the fountaine of life, who lives for ever, to quicken dying, and refreſh weary Travellers. They who walke in the good old way by repentance, faith, and obedience, may with boldneſſe, with liberty, expect hereby to enter into the Holieſt, into the place where Gods Holineſſe dwelleth, into the Heavenly Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary. Jeſus Chriſt came <hi>downe from Heaven,</hi> to open this new and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving way to <hi>advance them to Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us now ſee what emprovement may bee made of this Truth, in the application of it, to provide you in your journey to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Sion.</p>

Conſider that of <hi>Wiſdome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov 1. 25. 26, 27, 28.</note> and tremble; what if calamity come on you? who ſhall helpe you? God will laugh when your calamity commeth, and mocke when your deſtruction, and deſolation, and feare ſhall ſeiſe on you; Why? becauſe you would have none of his Counſell, you would have none of his reproofe; You did not chooſe the feare of the Lord. I wiſh you would all expoſtulate the caſe with your ſelves, now, ſeriouſly in the preſence of God.</p>
            <p>What <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

to the reſt of my Soule? What an enemy have I been to my ſoule that have inſlaved my ſelfe to my luſts all this while, that have turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my back on God and his wayes, and will not by any importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though God himſelf ſpeaks from heaven, bee brought into this good way? Many pleaſe themſelves, if they walke in ſuch wayes as lead to their own profit, and to their owne worldly pleaſures, O but what will bee the iſſue? Why, look into the 4 of <hi>Judges, ver.</hi> 18, 19. You ſhall finde the other wayes wherein you walked, are thoſe that deceived, that promiſed good intertainment, who will<note place="margin">Judg. 4. 18, 19. 21.</note> deale with you juſt as <hi>Jael</hi> did with <hi>Siſera,</hi> ſhee came out indeed in the 18 <hi>ver.

            <p>The world hath bottles of milke, ſweet pleaſures, ſatisfying con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments, men may ſuck out of the breaſts of the world a great deale of ſatisfaction for a time, but when you are wrapped warme in the world, and fall aſleepe in the very armes of creature comforts, what will bee the iſſue? See how ſhee deales in the 21 <hi>ver. Shee tooke a nayle of the Tent, and tooke an hammer in her band, and went ſoftly unto him, and ſmote the nayle in his Temple, and faſtned it into the ground (for hee was faſt aſleepe, and weary) ſo hee dyed.</hi> This is the intertainment that worldly Temptations give to many people; They will hugge you for a time, and they will give you milke, and they will ſeeme to cover you, and wrap you warme, but when once you are gotten into a dead ſleepe, a nayle is driven into your Temples, and there is an end of an old worldling, there is an end of ſuch a deluded ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that would not come into Gods wayes, but gratifie the devill, and ſtill continue in ſuch ſoule-deceiving wayes: (I wiſh rather there were many among you, that had <hi>Joſhua's</hi> Heroicall reſolution this day, (for a day of humiliation, it is a day to renew your reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to renew your Covenant with your God) that would<note place="margin">Joſh. 24. 15. <hi>Joſhua</hi> an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Coppy.</note> ſay in defiance to all bad examples, with an holy ſingularity, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever others doe, <hi>I and my houſe will ſerve the Lord.

Thou canſt not ſay but God hath ſent from Heaven this day, by his owne word to call thee, to ſtand, to conſider, to looke about thee, and to make proviſion for thy ſoule; Doe not now heare what worldly profit ſaith, or liſten only what ſecular advantage, but hearken what God ſaith, for the good of thy ſoule: It may bee if you were now to make your wills, ſome rich man among you, hath ſo many hundreds for ſuch a Childe, and ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion for Wife, and ſuch Legacies for Friends, O but what hath your poore <hi>Soule</hi> all this while?

            <p>There is a Story of one <hi>Marinus,</hi> a Souldier, having hopes of preferment to ſome place, being a Chriſtian; It was ſuggeſted to him, that hee muſt firſt forſake his <hi>Religion,</hi> before hee ſhould bee inveſted in his preferment; It was ſo ſtrong a temptation to him, that hee beganne to ſtagger between his preferment, and his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity: But by the providence of God, there commeth one <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtus</hi> to him, brings him into the <hi>Temple,</hi> and layeth by him a <hi>Sword</hi> and the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> the Sword was the Enſigne of his place and preferment, hee was to have but one; now ſaith hee, whether will you have rather, the <hi>Bible</hi> or the <hi>Sword?</hi> and dealt ſo ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly with him, that it pleaſed God at laſt to overcome him, hee would rather have the <hi>Bible,</hi> and let goe the <hi>Sword,</hi> and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and hopes, and all worldly pompe, and choſe the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> that ſo hee might ſave his Soule; Oh that there were many in this Congregation, raiſed to this Heroick reſolution this day, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the competition bee, Is it a place, is it preferment, is it an Office?

I doubt not, but this City might honour God, and honour themſelves, in ſome ſuch courſe as this is: In all your Hoſpitalls, in all your Schooles, let there bee a wiſe obſerving by thoſe that are able to diſcerne what is the proper genius, ſpirit, and diſpoſition of young Youths, where is any of ſpeciall parts, that hath not onely ſeeds of piety, but ſingular indow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of nature: And though I would bee loath to preſſe upon ſo bountifull a City as this, any thing that might adde to your vaſt

            <p>God hath beene pleaſed already to ſhine upon us in the hopefull beginning of Reformation of Univerſities; and every one of us in our way and place, are to further that worke wherein we are all, more or leſſe, eſpecially concerned. This will moſt Succesfully bee done, by ſending ſuch perſons <hi>thither,</hi> as may bee moſt capable of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement there; which may not for want of parts bee diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from following thoſe ſtudies which ſhall there bee required of them; and then for want of imployment in their ſtudies, runne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out into ſuch vicious courſes, as may make them to rue the day that ever they came thither. The rule which Parents have gone by formerly, in making ſuch and ſuch Children Scholars, has beene a reſpect to their owne education; They have been Scholars it may be themſelves, and therefore thinke that their Sonnes (however qualifed) muſt needs be ſo alſo; and others, by very ſiniſter reſpects; Gentlemen, if they have divers Children, to make Scholars of thoſe which are the youngeſt, as a <hi>ſhift,</hi> rather then a <hi>calling,</hi> and ſomewhat whereby they might rather provide for their worldly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, then for the ſervice of the Church &amp; Common-wealth. Now that which I commend to your Wiſdomes in this point of publique Education, is to bee carryed by another Conſideration; <hi>to wit,</hi> of the pregnancy of parts and capacity in Children; ſuch being che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed and promoted in Learning, they may by Gods bleſſing prove able guides to bring others into the good way.</p>
