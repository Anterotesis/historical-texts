         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am perſwaded that ſome men will be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
with me becauſe I ſhould appear up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Paper, and I deſire to give them ſome of
my weak reaſons in way of ſatisfaction; as
being an engaged <hi>Covenanter,</hi> who often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
have had ſome ſad reflections upon my Spirit, for
being ſo ſilent thorow fear, whether it did not make me,
and divers others, acceſſary to the Death and Bloud of
the late <hi>King;</hi> which thing I ever abhorred in my
thoughts, he being <hi>Gods Vicegerent,</hi> and by him ſet over
us, and by him alone to be judged; who by a poor ague
or grief of his diſtreſſed heart could have ſilenced him,
but left to try us Covenanters; and alſo having prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
to God with the reſt of the Nation, in a <hi>ſolemne
League and Covenant,</hi> not to diminiſh his juſt Power and
Greatneſs, much leſs his Life; and with it ſuch a deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
both of Church and State, which I have lived to ſee
to my great grief; and done by profeſſing Chriſtians,
thoſe that Covenanted alſo as we did, not with Man but
with the dreadful God; and for private ends, I fear, and
as now it doth plainly appear by the fruits this Self-inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
hath brought forth, (for the good of the whole Nation
theſe many years.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:101562:3"/>
Otherwhiles I have had thoughts of the words that
our bleſſed Saviour ſaid to his Apoſtles, that <hi>A Sparrow
falls not to the ground without the will of God;</hi> and it was
his will to bring theſe heavy afflictions upon the <hi>Church,
State and King;</hi> As the ſacred Scriptures in divers places
ſhew, how the glorious Majeſty and all-commanding
power of Heaven and Earth hath done for the ſins of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Nations; all whoſe wayes and judgments are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Juſtice, and uncontroulable Truths.</p>
            <p>And ſo likewiſe I had thoughts at other times, of the
gracious goodneſs of our merciful Father, in ordering a
way for the Redemption of loſt man, by the death and
precious bloud-ſhedding of his righteous Son, that holy
Oblation: But I obſerve that <hi>Judas</hi> had a hand in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying
his righteous Maſter, for ſelf-ends or envy, but he
periſhed with his ill-gotten monies, and not alone: For
alſo in that relation I find divers perſons of rank and
quality, both Prieſts and learned people too, ſeeking di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
wayes by their Emiſſaries, how they might put him
to <hi>death,</hi> and not without the conſent of many of the
<hi>Commons</hi> alſo, with whom they uſed ſuch artifices; being
Joynt-confederates, that the whole gang of them cry
out, <hi>His Bloud be on us and on our children;</hi> and it ſtuck
ſo cloſe to them, that the whole Nation felt the ſad iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues
of their fearful Imprecations. The good God deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
us from the ſame Judgements; we having ſlain our
King, and taken poſſeſſion, and baniſhed his Poſterity, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe
or ſhare with a Party of ſelf-intereſted men, in the
ruines of Him, the Church, and the Nations Laws and
goods, after a ſolemn <hi>Covenant</hi> made with hands lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
up to the moſt high God, and contrary to the conſent
of moſt of the whole Nations, who had no hand in his
Death, nor means to prevent it, but by Weeping to ſee
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101562:3"/>
and hear what a few Armed men, and their Complices,
would violently do, contrary to known Law or right, by
a new-deviſed <hi>High Court,</hi> by them called <hi>Justice,</hi> ſet up
by the tyrannizing Sword to deſtroy <hi>King, Nobles</hi> and
<hi>Law,</hi> to ſatisfie their own bloud-thirſty deſigns.</p>
            <p>I have had alſo divers debates in my mind, about ſome
ſcruples that were often there, when I could not ſleep, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Covenant, and the Hanging of it up in our
Churches, as if it were a thing ſeriouſly to be performed,
or as a Teſtimony againſt us, being ſo ſolemnly taken in
his holy Temple, once made to the God of all the earth,
who is able in a moment of time to deſtroy us poor craw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
worms; and ſo earneſtly preſt alſo upon the people
by the Divines, and by them and us ſo little regarded, as
if God were to be jeſted with and Mans Conſcience
would perpetually be injured, and yet be ſilent or wink
at ſuch high deceiving ſubtilties.</p>
            <p>And chancing to read in the Turkiſh Hiſtory, in the
reign of <hi>Amurath</hi> the ſixt King of the Turks, who ſeeing
the great ſlaughter of his men, and all brought into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
danger,<note place="margin">As the Covenant is in our Churches.</note> and beholding the Picture of the <hi>Crucifix</hi>
in the diſplayed Enſigns of the Chriſtians, pluckt the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out of his boſom, wherein the League of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
was comprized, and holding it up in his hands, with
his eyes caſt up to Heaven, ſaid:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Behold, thou crucified Chriſt; This is the League thy Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
in thy name made with me, which they have without
cauſe violated; now if thou be a God, as they ſay thou art,
and as we dream, revenge the wrong now done unto thy Name
and me, and ſhew thy power upon thy perjured people, who in
their deeds deny thee their God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shortly after the Turks got the victory, and the poor
Chriſtians miſerably put to the ſlaughter, and <hi>Julian</hi> one
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101562:4"/>
of the Cardinals, Author of the breach of the Chriſtians
Articles (though fled) found mortally wounded and near
dead; who was ſharply reproved by an eminent Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
<hi>Gregory Sanoſe,</hi> but left to periſh unpitied in a Deſart;
in which fatal Battle were ſlain ſuch huge numbers of
men, that the hills and mountains, raiſed with the bones
of the ſlain in this Battle, to this day bear witneſs; as
ſaith the ſame Author of the <hi>Turkiſh Hiſtory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then, good Friends, what may we fear when the great
God makes inquiſition for Bloud and breach of Vows?
both of the Clergy that had the charge of our ſouls, and
ſhould have given us true counſel, as well as of the poor
Laity, who have been led as ſheep to the ſlaughter, when
the Alarums have founded out of the Pulpits in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of theſe Times, <hi>Curſe ye</hi> Meroz, <hi>curſe ye bitterly the
Inhabitants thereof, becauſe they came not to the help of the
Lord againſt the mighty:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Judges 5. 23.</note> and others violently reproching
the Liturgie or Prayer-book of our Church, and all that
owned it Malignants and Oppoſers of the Reformation.</p>
            <p>Beſides, I being called, though very unfit and more
unſerviceable for any publick duty, and voted down or
turned away <hi>February</hi> 9. 1659. from the diſcharge of our
duties and Conſcience enjoyned by Oath, for the publick
ſervice of the City, (which that haſty Vote did not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve.)
And I humbly conceiving it might be ſomewhat
more than man that brought things ſo about, that ſuch a
poor <hi>Muſhrome,</hi> as my unworthy ſelf, ſhould be at all
thought on for ſuch affairs, when divers of more knowing
worth, degree and fitneſs were forgotten.</p>
            <p>But thus being put into the traces, and my dull ſenſes
laſht by divers able mens diſputes, about our <hi>Nationall</hi>
and <hi>City-priviledges;</hi> and hearing Mr. <hi>Barbone</hi> a juſting
thoſe members (in theſe words) now ſitting to be the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament

of <hi>England,</hi> and the ſame men that acted there
the laſt Summer, and were ſo by the City and Nation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,
and the Taxes then leavyed by them, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
by us, and why not now being the ſame Parliament
of <hi>England</hi> now ſitting, it was a wonder to him, being
laſht, as I ſaid before, and this Gentlemans words, ſo
touching my galled Conſcience, began to winch, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
preſt by its diſcharge, I like blind <hi>Bayard</hi> ſaid:</p>
            <p>My Lord Mayor, <hi>The Gentleman that ſpake laſt concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Parliament of</hi> England, <hi>as he calls the Gentlemen
now ſitting, ſurely miſtakes the ſenſe of this Court; for truly,
my Lord, I am perſwaded there is never a Member here but
honours the Parliament of</hi> England, <hi>and will lay their hands
under their feet, and ſacrifice thier lives and eſtates to do them
ſervice, and we honour theſe that now are ſet at the Stern as
men of worth and quality: But, my Lord, we cannot ſay by
theſe Gentlemen, though by us once freely choſen, becauſe they
were d<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſſolved by the late Kings death, as by Law hath been
undeniably proved; but, my Lord, divers of theſe did deſert
their Trust that we repoſed in them, and went to the Army,
and brought in</hi> Oliver <hi>the great Oppreſſor to invade our
Rights, and with his and their Adherents by force ſecluded
moſt of our Truſtees, and were themſelves alſo diſſolved ſo by
him and his Complices, though they acted with and for him a
long time; and now, my Lord, your Honour and all us well
know, that the ſame force that pull'd down</hi> great Olivers Son,
<hi>ſet up theſe that now ſit by the Lord</hi> Lamberts <hi>aſsiſtance, and
by his force were the third time diſſolved, and now by the
ſtrength of an Army are again ſet in power to act as our Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives,
although not new elected or choſen by us, according
to our Laws and Engliſh Birth-rights, as hath been throughly
debated in this Court by divers worthy Citizens of able know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:101562:5"/>
               <hi>judgments, that intended no hurt to theſe Gentlemen that
now ſit, but the right and good of all the Nation and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
My Lord, this that hath now been plainly ſaid is truth,
and Truth ſeeks no corners, nor theſe Gentlemen a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by us choſen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſubſtance of theſe words was offered at the <hi>Guild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall</hi>
in the Council of the <hi>Commons, February</hi> 8. 1659.
when the Army was new come to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Friday being the 10. of the ſame Moneth,
the Gates of the City were broken down, and our Poſts
and Chains pluckt up, and divers of our Members ſent
Priſoners to the <hi>Tower;</hi> and our ſorrowful hearts over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
with grief, dreading the fearful iſſue following;
yet truſting ſtill in God, our alone <hi>great Deliverer,</hi> who
comforting our drooping hearts by his gracious appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in a merciful meaſure for us, on Saturday the II. of
the ſame Moneth, on which night was great joy expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by many of the younger ſort by Bonfires in every
eminent ſtreet; and I doubt not but the elder ſort, both
Laymen and Divines, ſacrificed divers humble Prayers
and hearty thanks to the moſt high God our whole deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer,
whoſe heavenly ſmiles did then graciouſly glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
upon us his poor diſtreſſed creatures; whoſe holy
Name be eternally praiſed by all that fear him; whoſe
goodneſs we hope will now perfect our now new begun
joy.</p>
            <p>I have lived to ſee our <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> the defenders
of our Faith and Church, with their friends and adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
ſuffer; and I may yet live to ſee the Troublers of
our Peace and Church, with their <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and all
their <hi>Abiramiſts,</hi> overwhelmed, or as I deſire, conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:101562:5"/>
Then let not our Faith fail us, but ſtand ſtill and ſee,
how our God will deliver us; and remember when his
ſervants, the diſtreſſed Sons of <hi>Jacob,</hi> were at the brink
of the Sea, and <hi>Egypts</hi> Hoſt fiercely purſuing, and <hi>Iſraels</hi>
fainting ſpirits ſinking, and their doubtful thoughts brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
out into doleful expreſſions, <hi>Becauſe there were no

Therefore take courage, dear Brethren, of this
City, and the bottomleſs ſea of our diſtruſts may become
walls to our fainting ſpirits, and our ſelves though going
through theſe troubled ſeas in this night of our afflictions,
we may yet ſtand upon the ſhore of ſafety, by the power
of our God, and ſee theſe furious Conjurers and <hi>Pharaoh</hi>-like
Task-maſters floating upon the deep waters of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair,
helpleſs; for it is the ſame <hi>Jehovah,</hi> who ſaved <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
that will deliver us; and be confident the Arke of
his Truth, which we truſt in, will tumble down the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi>
of their Injuſtice, let them ſet it up never ſo often;
and let us belive with faithful <hi>Abraham,</hi> that <hi>The Judge
of all the earth will do right.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>I have been alſo often grieved to hear and ſee ſuch a
dull and negligent garb of Publick Worſhip as is now uſed
in divers Churches.</p>
            <p>Over that reverential form of Publick Worſhip was
that I had the happineſs to ſee, before theſe times of
Trouble and Confuſion; which, if at all offenſive to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
might by skilful Workmen have been handſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
mended, than by ſuch ſelf-conceited Bunglers thus
ill-favour'dly patcht up, and peſtered with Sectaries of
all kind of colours, as if they intended to make it like my
Lord Huſons Fool: But the holy Scripture ſaith, <hi>When the
blind lead the blind, we muſt needs fall into the</hi> diſtreſſed
<hi>ditch</hi> of our confuſed Fopperies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:101562:6"/>
The good Lord give us grace to return and humbly beg
mercy through the merits of our dear Saviour, whoſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
Father we have moſt egregiouſly provoked to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure,
before his fierce deſerved warth break in upon
us; and ſeek our God in ſincerity by humiliation and true
imitation of the <hi>Ninevites</hi> unfeigned Faſts, and lay by
our hypocritical vizards with which we have ſo long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Nation and our ſelves, and walk no more by
Sathans Dark-lanthorns, but revive the former pure
lights that ſhewed us the right wayes to Unity in perfect
forms of divine Worſhip; which teacheth us to pray for
the Governors his goodneſs will be pleaſed to ſet over
us, and for one another, that our Church and State may
once again flouriſh in unity and concord, with due reſpect
to tender Conſciences that are not factious.</p>
            <p>And then it were but equity, if rightly conſidered, in
my weak apprehenſion, for to ſuffer us that would joyn
together in the praiſing of the Almighty glory with our
interlocutory voices, in acknowledging and humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
our manifold ſins before the great God of Heaven
and earth, Angels and Men, in his publick fit-to-be-done
Worſhip; and, becauſe it beſt ſuits with our Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and the rules of Righteouſneſs in the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
which ſaith, That <hi>At what time ſoever a Sinner doth
repent him of his ſins from the bottom of his heart, I will put
away all his wickedneſs out of my remembrance, ſaith the
Lord: and likewiſe, When two or three are gathered together
in my Name, there will I be in the midſt of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And humbly may I ſay, and cannot otherwiſe think,
but that when ſo many multitudes of People, at the
known divine Worſhip of the immortal God in publick,
but that there be divers that worſhip him in <hi>Spirit</hi> and
<hi>Truth,</hi> and do not conceive it an Idol-worſhip, (as I have
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101562:6"/>
heard Mr. <hi>Pernes</hi> out of his Pulpit call the <hi>Common Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-Book</hi>
an <hi>Idol)</hi> although they knew the words they
were to praiſe God with before they met, rather than un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premeditated
diſguſtings; remembring the rule of a
wiſe man, <hi>God is in Heaven and thou art on Earth;</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
well knowing that <hi>The ſpirit is willing but the fleſh is
weak.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore the Confeſſion uſed in our well-ordered
Church, that all the Congregation might bear a part in
the humble acknowledgment of their many faults, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
kneeling upon their bended knees, with holy adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the Almighty glory, clapping their trembling
hands upon their ſorrow-ſmitten breaſts, humbly begging
pardon for our manifold tranſgreſſions of him who onely
can grant us pardon, and hear our petitions; and moſt
likely, when ſo many millions of ſin-ſick humbled ſouls
ſhall be invocating Heaven with one conſent in the ſame
words, betwixt the hours of 9. and 12. upon his dayes and
places appointed for his publick Worſhip in the three na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
over it is now in our Churches; when but one in a
Congregation, and that what he pleaſeth, and many
times ſo low that few can hear or learn, the matter being
changed ſo often, and many times ſo thin, that it ſlides
away unheeded, and without an <hi>Abſolution</hi> alſo of our
ſins, though never more need.</p>
            <p>Nor can I be of Mr. <hi>Pernes</hi> opinion, who directed his
Auditors to pray in their Families although their folks
laughed at them, when ſo many well-formed prayers are
extant for poor Penitents to follow, without oftentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or vain Fantaſies of their own giddy brain; as that
Prayer of prayers taught us by the bleſſed lips of our dear
Redeemer, wherein all things needful at once are begged
in that holy Epitomie, which teacheth us how to pray,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101562:7"/>
and to whom, and by him commanded, <hi>When you pray, ſay
our Father which art in Heaven, &amp;c.</hi> and yet by divers
not at all uſed, for what reaſon I never yet heard, nor can I
think, unleſs they think it is too mean or too common for
their high-gifted Fantaſies, or would help the Enemy to
obliterate it, that he might do us more evil. Pardon me,
I pray, all you that neglect it, for it doth make the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people too too much ſlight it by ſuch eminent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</p>
            <p>Nor would I be herein miſtaken, as not to like and allow
of <hi>voluntary prayers,</hi> which ought to be often ſeriouſly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed
before publiquely uſed by devout ſouls, it being the
onely remedy for the ſaddeſt complaints of any afflicting
conſcience, to make his timely addreſſes to his offended
God, for the quieting of his ſorrow-troubled ſoul; and
was alwayes allowed in our Churches before and after
Sermons, as I have often heard before theſe times; and
now praiſe be to the higheſt Lord, by divers rarely gifted
Divines, as the Angel of the Church of St. <hi>Dunſtans,</hi> and
many others, whoſe heavenly expreſſing language pours
forth the dictates of the holy Spirit, filling their Auditors
ears with ſuch ſoul-raviſhing meditations, as if the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-working
power had inflamed their zealous hearts
with heavenly firing raptures. And it was well with us
when ſuch men ſteer'd the helm of publick Worſhip, that
being alwayes moſt for Gods glory: Although private
Worſhip ought to be in great eſteem, as beſt pleaſing to
God, which our bleſſed Saviour doth direct; thoſe ſecret
Cloſet-confeſſions of a broken and contrite heart, with all
the ſorrow-ſhaking throws of a diſtreſſed ſoul, pouring
forth his ſaddeſt griefs before the heavenly throne, that
onely can help in time of greateſt need; which our old
enemy knows is likelieſt to prevail with God, whoſe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101562:7"/>
merciful goodneſs hath ſaid, <hi>Come unto me all ye that are
heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the ſubtile betrayer of our weak performances, is
apt to ſuggeſt his old cunning ſophiſtries into our ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deluded
ſouls, as he did our firſt Mother, Theſe medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in publick, amongſt the gifted Brotherhood would
make thee highly eſteemed and accounted wiſe, in letting
your inſpired new-tinded Lights be ſeen before religious
men; for the moſt <hi>tear-melting Hypocrite,</hi> that is beſt able
to deceive himſelf and others, is the <hi>Saint,</hi> that liketh him
beſt: <hi>(Herod</hi> had the applauſe, that <hi>It was the voice of a
God and not of a man.)</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 12. 22.</note> For he by no means would have
us take counſel of our moſt endearing Saviour, nor follow
his examples; who often withdrew himſelf apart to pray
unto his all-guiding God, to hold an heavenly conference
with his Almighty Father about the great work of our
Redemption; and he hath alſo directed us <hi>To enter into
our Cloſſets to pray in ſecret to our heavenly Father,</hi> where
we ſhould unburthen our ſin-guilty ſouls with the grones
of his heavenly Spirit, no where elſe ſo ſufficiently to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
our troubled minds and the diſtreſſes of our dejected
ſpirits, before a powerful forgiving God, who knows the
ſecret thoughts of our deceitful hearts, before our
tongues or briniſh tears unfold our ſhameful griefs, not
fit for others ears to hear. Nor can ſuch grief-expreſſing
mones be made by a truly Penitents throbbing breaſt in
publick, but our old enemy will be diſtracting our
thoughts with his ſubtile deluſions, which ſpoil the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the ſerious prayers that we poor weaklings can
perform in the ſight of others. The Lord preſerve us
from his trecheries, whoſe whole work is to deceive us.</p>
            <p>Therefore a known form of publick Worſhip, that all
may uſe, is ſurely requiſite: For may we not obſerve by
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101562:8"/>
the vile things now done by divers, what want there hath
been of the due obſervance of the great commands of the
everliving God, delivered upon Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> by the
voice of the powerful Maſter, when the Heaven-ſhaking
thunders made the earth to tremble, and <hi>Jacobs</hi> whole po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity
to quake to hear what indignations the wilful
breakers of theſe Heaven-given Laws ſhould be puniſhed
with; yet now for more than 12. years in divers Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
not read to the people nor obſerved, as our duty
binds us: whereby our tranſgreſſions (we may obſerve)
are multiplied, our great Gods commands too much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured,
and by many falſly worſhipped, his Name vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
taken in vain by our too too many <hi>Oaths</hi> and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of <hi>Covenants,</hi> and <hi>hypocritical Faſts,</hi> breaking of <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths,</hi>
marching of armed men <hi>all dayes</hi> alike, <hi>diſhonouring
our Magiſtrates</hi> and <hi>Parents, Murthering our King, Prieſts</hi>
and <hi>Commons, odious Adulteries</hi> uſed among us, and many
<hi>falſe Witneſſes</hi> for Sequeſtrations, and unneighbourly dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
too frequently uſed amongſt us, and too <hi>covetous</hi> of
all manner of our <hi>Neighbours goods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when thoſe heavenly-breathed Petitions were
poured out by all the Congregation to the Almighty
glory, <hi>Lord have mercy upon us, and encline our hearts to
keep this Law; and alſo, Lord have mercy upon us, and write
all theſe thy Laws in our hearts we beſeech thee;</hi> O what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations
of joy thoſe men breathed Petitons made
againſt the walls of heaven, and entered into the holy ears
of the Almighty; which by experience we may and ought
to know, when his holy, glorious bleſſings preſerved our
Governours and Nation with tranquility and peace, both
from domeſtick and forreign foes, for many ſcore years
together, when thoſe forms of publick Worſhip were
continued, wherein all had a ſhare: But our old enemy
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101562:8"/>
(with his buſie inſtruments, who were long ago about to
ſlight this work) knew well, that as long as God was ſo
worſhipped by thoſe conſtant forms of ſo well an inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Church, his labours were to no end: But at laſt he
found Feoffees indeed he could truſt, who with their
ſchiſmatique hammers and deſtroying Pickaxes of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
would now up with Root and Branch, and take the
<hi>Bramble</hi> for the <hi>Vine,</hi> whoſe government he well knew
would ſufficiently ſcratch both <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,</hi>
into the ſad condition he long ago wiſhed for, as
our ſelves and the diſtreſſed poor ſtript Sons of the
Church by woful experience can teſtifie.</p>
            <p>But ſince the conſtant Prayers for all occaſions of our
well-ordered Church were put out of uſe, how hath all
things looked like the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> as if a <hi>Chaos</hi> of confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
had infatuated all our Councils and actings, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
cometh to good: And ſince the Pale of our diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<hi>Sion</hi> and <hi>National Government</hi> was broken down by
our ſchiſmatique Factions, <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi>
have all ſuffered a juſt deſerved affliction, by the loſs of
uniformity in Prayer for Magiſtrates and people: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
thoſe unhappy hands who ſet about this fatal work, in
making way for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to unkennel her ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
Foxes to deſtroy ours, with the help of our <hi>long tusked

of our <hi>dear Mother,</hi> and are like to deſtroy the
reſt of her tender plants, if God in mercy prevent it not.
But Gods divine vengeance, whoſe Judgments have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
upon divers of them, our eyes have ſeen, that are
roled into their graves with reproch, and their names re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
in infamy for after-Ages to abhor, that nulled
theſe heavenly petitions, <hi>From Plague, Peſtilence and</hi>

               <hi>Famine, from Battle and Murther, and from ſudden death,

both old and young adore their holy Maker, and
ſince this named <hi>Reformation,</hi> how unreverently do moſt
demean themſelves in his ſacred Temples, the place of his
divine worſhip, where children, boyes and unmannerly
ſervants clap on their hats before their Maſters, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
Miniſters, Judges and all degrees of men, and yet
forbear it at home, but preſume to affront God with as
much unhandſom worſhip as the Reformation is pleaſed
to ſuffer to avoid Superſtition. When I have obſerved in
inferiour Courts, as at Seſſions and elſewhere in cooler
air before men, onely earthly Judges and upon wooden
benches, highly reverenced, as if it were ſome great fault
to be covered before them, who are but the Keepers of
the laws of Men, when our ever-living God, who made
the glorious heavens, with all the mighty vaſt movables,
who keep their courſe for the obſervation of times and
ſeaſons, ever ſince the Creation, with the maſſy globe we
trample upon, which he hath hung in the air by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of his all-commanding word, with the proud waves of
the great Deep, who keep their violent ebbings and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in their appointed channels, round the circumference
of the earth with admiration and wonder: And yet this
infinite incomprehenſible all-powerful God, that giveth
us all good things here, and eternal life hereafter, is ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſomly
ſerved by us his poor creatures, and may not
be ſuffered without offence (forſooth) to tender Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
to uſe our dear Mothers decent dreſſings in her
humble ornaments to do her divine adorations to this
glorious King, for fear of uſhering in Superſtition; as if
rational men might not teach their children and ſervants
ſuch reſpective obſervations in holy worſhip (to our great
God, before whom the Cherubims and glorious Angels
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101562:10"/>
tremble when they come before him) as in civility we do
to one another, and before our earthly Judges which die
like men.</p>
            <p>And why thoſe decent poſtures of humbly kneeling
when the Sacrament is received, and thoſe known pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
fitted for that poſture ſaid, as <hi>The body of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt which was given for thee, &amp;c.</hi> and likewiſe thoſe
agonizing words, <hi>The bloud of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt which
was ſhed for thee, &amp;c.</hi> all thoſe known prayers uſed by all
the Communicants, to keep the evil one from hindring
our ſerious meditations, and humble invocations upon
our bended knees, whiles others were ſinging thoſe <hi>hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
Hymns,</hi> while the holy ſacrificed Oblation was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membringly
performed by all the believing Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants;
over that that I have ſeen of late by divers, who
are very obſervant to ſee how the deliverer prayes and
receives, whilſt divers are at gaze to ſee what others do,
more than ſeriouſly I fear to conſider the <hi>great work</hi> we
are about which brings <hi>life</hi> or <hi>death.</hi> Truly I like not the
new way though performed by able men, but will have
none but their ſelect permitted, when they cannot ſee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the hearts of men more now, than the inſpired Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
could, who charged us <hi>to examine our ſelves</hi> upon
great penalties. The people would indeed go up to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem
to worſhip,</hi> after the accuſtomed manner, and <hi>Jerobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi>
would deviſe a new way to reſtrain their old way of
Sacrificing, but it became a fault, I pray God it may be
none to our Reſtrainers from the uſual Sacraments.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe, I have wondred why the Birth of our bleſſed
Saviour ſhould not be ſolemnized, (as formerly it was) by
as wiſe and learned men as are now, to keep in memory a
day for his birth; ſince God ſo miraculouſly, and of his
own goodneſs, hath been pleaſed to diſcover how our
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101562:10"/>
God was made man, and that holy born man made God
to redeem us, and therefore in my weak judgment fit to
be kept in perpetual memory to all generations of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
men, until the Reſurrection, when there will be no
diſtinction of Gods: At laſt I did conceive it was the old
enemy of mans happineſs, that would obliterate the great
Gods Birth-day, under ſome reforming pretence, that in
time he might bring in Infideliſm, and by degrees damp
the light of the holy Scriptures, the great work he is now
about; the Lord prevent him with the birth of our dear
Saviour whom he would have forgotten: Then let him
alone to bring ſeveral gods amongſt us, as <hi>Aſhteroth, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech,
Mahomet,</hi> or any of thoſe heatheniſh Baboons; but
God, who is alwayes good to his, is now raiſing up one
inſtrument or other to keep the memory of his holy
Childs birth on foot, as may be ſpoken to his glorious
honour, and the immortal praiſe of that vertuous Lady
<hi>Parthenia Lowman,</hi> who hath given to St. <hi>Dunstans</hi> weſt,
and two or three adjacent pariſhes 100 l. apeece, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
whereof ſhe hath ordered to be given to glad
the hearts of the Poor upon the Birth-day of our bleſſed
Lord, with a commemoration-Sermon alſo to continue
his ſacred memory to all ſucceeding generations.</p>
            <p>What offence likewiſe to any did that ſoul-raviſhing
Emphaſis and general applauſe of all the Congregation to
the honor of our moſt endearing God, <hi>Glory be to the Father,
and to the Son, and to the holy Ghoſt, &amp;c.</hi> fit to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
and uſed by all the ſincere Worſhippers of God
throughout the whole world. And this interlocutory Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xology
holy <hi>David</hi> did allow, and ſure his judgment was
right, being by teſtimony of holy Writ, <hi>A man after Gods
own heart,</hi> when he breaks forth into holy raptures in <hi>Pſal.

               <hi>thee;</hi> and with this promiſed bleſſing, <hi>ver. 6. Then ſhall the
Earth bring forth her increaſe, and God, even our God, ſhall
give us his bleſsing.</hi> To ſpeak the very truth, there are ſo
many holy ſentences, and heavenly ejaculations, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
prayers for all occaſions, that it makes my amazed
ſoul to wonder and tremble, that we ſhould neglect, nay
with contempt ſlight and caſt out, ſuch a well-framed
form of publick worſhip, that inſtructed the ſimple and
unlearned to rightly worſhip God, by her conſtant rules
of publick worſhip. But I have done: This is a work in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
for ſome Angelick Orator, to let us ignorant know
the heavenly uſe might be made of ſuch a mercy we once
enjoyed, though now ſlighting that <hi>Manna</hi> ſo wiſely
provided for us.</p>
            <p>Having thus caſt in my two poor inconſiderable Mites,
the one for the <hi>Liberties</hi> of my native Country, the other
for my dear Mother the diſtreſſed Church of <hi>England</hi> in
theſe troubleſom times: I hope my friends will ſparingly
cenſure the weak ſmoakings of this ſmothering flax; and
for my foes to this juſt cauſe and me, the good Lord for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
them and pardon me, in time of greateſt need (if any
trouble come) for thus diſcharging my Conſcience as
being a <hi>Covenanter</hi> and loving well-willer to the Church

hands and unpolliſhed Pen, in touching things ſo
far above my feeble reach, (and with the greateſt, accept
of the will for the deed) you know the poor widow would
caſt into the Treaſury <hi>all that ſhe had;</hi> and it was the poor
Shepherds, inconſiderable perſons, I humbly conceive, that

of our dear mothers new-born Bridgroom: And we poor

Church again comforted; therefore I hope you will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
me, poor deſpicable worm, (and with humble reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
I'le but remember you) A <hi>Carpenter</hi> was dry Nurſe
to the holy Son of the moſt high God; and divers mean
men have had a hand in repairing of Churches though
they could not perfect them; and I am confident the
Church with her decencies and truths will again be in high
eſteem with moderate men, when theſe foggy miſts of our
miſled underſtandings are diſpers'd, as God hath already
begun to manifeſt his divine power after his own way,<note place="margin">The wicked fly when none purſue.</note>
without one blow ſtrucken by man as yet, and many of
the oppoſers of Church and State <hi>nonplus'd</hi> or ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedly
aſtoniſhed and vaniſhed; and a great part of that
propheſie uttered by the late King performed, and all the
reſt of it haſting by divine juſtice to be made known to all
the world, as in the Kings Book of his Propheſies is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nor will he ſuffer thoſe men long to proſper in their
Babel, who build it with the bones, and cement it with the
bloud of their Kings. I am confident they will find avengers
of my death amongst themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the injuries I have ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from them ſhall be firſt puniſhed by them, who agreed in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſo much as in oppoſing me. Their impatience to hear
the loud cry of my bloud, ſhall make them think no way better
to expiate it than by ſhedding theirs, who with them moſt thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
after mine; who have cauſe to fear, that God will both
further divide, and by mutual vengeance afterwards deſtroy.</hi>

<hi>and</hi> Judah; and <hi>Iſrael</hi> was puniſhed, but the holy-hearted
King, when he ſaw the people in perplexity, cried out, <hi>Lo
