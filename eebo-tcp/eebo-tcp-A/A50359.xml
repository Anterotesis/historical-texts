            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> and
beginning of that ſad War,
which for ſo many yeers raged
within the bowels of a diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Kingdom, whoſoever will
write, though never ſo briefly, muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
premiſe ſomewhat touching the Cauſes
(according to the ſtate of the affairs and
times) of aſſembling that Parliament.</p>
            <p>And though the condition of <hi>Scotland</hi> and
<hi>Ireland</hi> were during that time no whit hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier,
(which being ſubject to the ſame King,
were expoſed to the ſame Calamity) our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
eſpecially ſhall be of <hi>England,</hi> as the
nobleſt Kingdom, and the Royal Seat; from
whence the diſtemper might firſt ariſe, and be
derived to the reſt. And wonderful it may
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49178:3"/>
ſeem, how great the diſtemper of that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
was, which ingendered ſo great a
diſeaſe! how great the malignity of that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,
to which a Parliament was not ſufficient
Medicine!</p>
            <p>Fourty yeers old was King <hi>Charles,</hi> and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
yeers had he reigned, when this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was called: ſo long had the Laws been
violated, (more then under any King) the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of the people invaded, and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of Parliament (by which Laws and
Liberties are ſupported) trodden under foot:
which had by degrees much diſcontented the
<hi>Engliſh Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the King, within the firſt four yeers of
his Reign, had called three Parliaments, and
ſoon diſſolved them all, before they could any
way benefit the Commonwealth, or redreſs
the leaſt grievance of the People. In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
he granted and ſigned the <hi>Petition of
Right;</hi> but ſuddenly breaking up that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he acted the ſame things in violation
of Laws, which he had done before. So that
it was manifeſt, that the Peoples Liberties, by
grant of that Petition, were not fortified, but
utterly overthrown; and it appeared, neither
Laws themſelves could give protection, nor
the Kings Faith ſecurity to the People. After
the diſſolution of the third Parliament, men
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49178:3"/>
were forbidden by Proclamation to ſpeak any
more of Parliaments. In this Interval, the
people at home were fleeced by Monopolies,
and many ways exacted upon by illegal
Taxes: abroad, ſcarce any Negotiations were
made, but ſuch as were deſtructive to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and the Commonwealth. In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of his Reign, an unhappie and diſhono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Expedition was made againſt the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,
to ſurpriſe <hi>Cales:</hi> another, more ſad
then that, againſt the French, in the following
yeer, at the Iſle of <hi>Rhee:</hi> but that, of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was moſt deſtructive to the Proteſtant
Religion, that King <hi>Charles,</hi> not long before
that time, had lent a ſtrong Navie to the King
of <hi>France;</hi> by whoſe force the Proteſtants
Ships through all <hi>France</hi> were vanquiſhed and
ſcattered, and the miſerable Town of <hi>Rochel</hi>
ſubdued by Famine, the worſt of all Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>The King, in the mean time, by many ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
ways, raiſed money through <hi>England:</hi>
large ſums of money were exacted through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole Kingdom; default of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
under the ſhadow of an abſolute Law.
Tunnage and Poundage were received with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the ordinary courſe of Law; and though
they were taken under pretence of guarding
the Seas, yet that great Tax of Ship-money
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49178:4"/>
was ſet on foot under the ſame colour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things were accompanied with the
enlargement of Foreſts, contrary to <hi>Magna
Charta;</hi> the forcing of Coat and Conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money;
taking away the Arms of the Train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Bands in many Counties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor was there any remedy left: for no
Courts of Judicature could give redreſs to
the people for theſe Illegal ſufferings; whilſt
Judges were diſplaced by the King, for not
complying with his will; and ſo awed, that
they durſt not do their duties: for, to hold
a Rod over them, a clauſe was altered in their
Patents.</p>
            <p>By this time, all thoughts of ever having a
Parliament were quite baniſhed; ſo many
Oppreſſions ſet on foot, ſo many illegal acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
done, that the onely way to juſtifie all,
was to do that one greater, To take away the
means which was ordained to redreſs them,
the lawful Government of <hi>England</hi> by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments.</p>
            <p>Whilſt the Kingdom was in this condition,
the ſerious and juſt men of <hi>England</hi> who
were not intereſſed in theſe Oppreſſions,
could not but entertain ſad thoughts of what
miſchief muſt needs follow ſo great an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice:
But another ſort of men (eſpecially
Lords and Gentlemen) by whom the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49178:4"/>
of Government were not much felt, did
nothing but applaud the happineſs of <hi>England,</hi>
calling thoſe ingrateful and factious ſpirits,
who complained of the breach of Laws and
Liberties; that the Kingdom abounded with
wealth, plenty, and all kinde of elegancies,
more then ever; and, that it was the honour
of a people, that their Monarch ſhould live
ſplendidly, and not be curbed at all in his
Prerogative, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Courtiers would begin to diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Parliaments in their ordinary diſcourſe,
That they were too injurious to the Kings
Prerogative: ſome of the greateſt States-men
and Privie Councellors would ordinarily
laugh at the ancient language of <hi>England,</hi>
when the word <hi>Liberty of the Subject</hi> was
named.</p>
            <p>Though the Kingdoms Liberties were thus
oppreſſed, yet Peace continued; and <hi>England</hi>
ſeemed happie in that tranquillity, until the
fatal Coal, which afterwards was blown into
ſo great a fire through the three Kingdoms,
began to be kindled in the yeer 1637. by a
deſigne which the King had upon <hi>Scotland;</hi>
which was (as pretended) to make a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
of Church-Worſhip, and Eccleſiaſtical
Government, between the two Kingdoms of
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi> The dignity and pomp
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49178:5"/>
of Prelacie had been much of late promoted
in <hi>England;</hi> in purſuance whereof, many
temporal Offices and Honours were confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
upon perſons Eccleſiaſtical, many Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
and Innovations brought into the
Church, and too neer approaches made in
ſome points of Doctrine to the Romiſh
Church, and a great contempt thrown upon
the other Reformed Churches in <hi>Europe:</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
ſeemed to be much countenanced in the
Court; and by reaſon of the Queens great
power with the King, ſeveral Nuncio's from
the Pope, as <hi>Panzani, Conn,</hi> and <hi>Roſetti,</hi> had
been received with great honour in the Court
of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King had made great preparations for
that work in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and beſtowed many
temporal offices and dignities upon Biſhops
in that Kingdom. In particular, 11 of the
Scotiſh Biſhops (being in all but 14) were
made Privie Councellors. But this diſpleaſed
the Scots, to whom Epiſcopacie it ſelf was
not acceptable; and having been once thrown
out of that Kingdom, was not reſtored but
by great endeavour and policie of King
<hi>James.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A book of Lyturgie was ſent by the King
into <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the year 1637. with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
Command, that they ſhould read it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49178:5"/>
in their Churches. The Scots com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained,
that a thing of ſo great concernment,
having not been allowed by their Church in
a National Synod, ſhould be impoſed upon
them: they complained likewiſe, that it was
not the ſame with the book of <hi>England,</hi> but
alterations were made, ſome of them (they
confeſſed) were for the better, but more for
the worſe. Laſtly, they affirmed, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
that book varies from the Engliſh Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie,
it approaches directly to the Romane
Miſſal, and all the parts of Popery are there.
But the King ſeemed to excuſe thoſe altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
in his great Declaration. Theſe are his
words, (which were not ſatisfactory to the
Scots:)</p>
            <p>We ſuppoſing that they might have taken ſome
offence, if We ſhould have tendered them the
Engliſh Service-book <hi>totidem verbis;</hi> and that
ſome factious ſpirits would have endeavoured to
have miſconſtrued it as a badge of dependencie of
that Church upon this of <hi>England,</hi> which We had
put upon them, to the prejudice of their Laws and
Liberties: We held it fitter that a new Book
ſhould be compoſed by their own Biſhops, in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
not differing from that of <hi>England,</hi> that
ſo the Romane party might not upbraid us with any
weighty or material differences in our Lyturgies;
and yet in ſome few inſenſible alterations differing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49178:6"/>
from that, it might truely and juſtly be reputed a
Book of that Churches own compoſing, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
by Our Royal authority, as King of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Book of Lyturgie was read, as the
King commanded, in the great Church at <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinburgh,</hi>
but not without a great uproar, in
which the Biſhop that read it hardly eſcaped.
The Plebeians firſt ſtirred; but preſently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the Nobility and Miniſters publikely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed
their deteſtation of that Book: ſome
therefore were ſent to the King, to intreat
him that he would recal his command con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
it.</p>
            <p>But the King was immoveable, and ſent
another peremptory command for reading of
the Book; and that all people who came as
Petitioners againſt it, ſhould depart from
<hi>Edinburgh:</hi> which did but increaſe the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Petitioners, who intreated the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
once more to ſend to the King concerning
it: in the mean time, they much accuſed their
Biſhops, as the cauſers of this Innovation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The King commanded his Councel to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
no more Petitions from them; and ſent
the Earl of</hi> Traquare <hi>into</hi> Scotland <hi>with a
Proclamation, which was publiſhed at</hi> Sterlin;
<hi>wherein he declared,</hi> That the Biſhops were
wrongfully accuſed about the Prayer-book; that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49178:6"/>
he himſelf was the Author of it, and all done
by his Command: he condemned their proceedings
as tumultuous, and denounced the puniſhment of
high-Treaſon to thoſe who perſiſted.</p>
            <p>Againſt this Proclamation the Lords of the
Commiſſion proteſted, and ſo did the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
and others; juſtifying their aſſembly to
be lawful, as tending to Gods glory, the Kings
honour, and Liberty of the Nation. Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
after, they entered into a Solemn
Covenant for defence of their Religion and
Liberties: This Covenant was ſubſcribed
not onely by the Nobles, but all ſorts of men,
that their number within few months was
many thouſands: the King enraged, did by
many Meſſengers condemn that Covenant:
the Scots defended it. What was alleadged
on both ſides, is more largely expreſſed in
that book intituled <hi>Tumultus Scotici.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>June,</hi> the Marqueſs <hi>Hamilton,</hi> as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner
from the King, came to <hi>Edinburgh;</hi>
who in vain dealt with the Covenanters to
renounce their Covenant; but publiſhed a
Proclamation of the Kings, wherein he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bears
to preſs the reading of that Prayer-book
upon them, and reſolved to call both a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
and Synod: but the Covenanters in
their Proteſtation declare, that the Kings
grants were not large enough to cure their
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49178:7"/>
preſent diſtempers; and offer ſome particular
Exceptions. So great grew the differences
and alterations upon ſeveral points, that the
Marqueſs <hi>Hamilton</hi> was enforced that yeer to
make two journeys into <hi>England</hi> to the King;
and at laſt, by the Kings command, called a
National Synod, which accordingly began at
<hi>Glaſco, Novemb.</hi> 1. but within ſeven days, the
Marqueſs diſſolved that Synod, alleadging for
reaſons, that they had broken the Laws of
a free Synod, both in the maner of their Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and in other buſineſſes during their
ſitting. But they proteſted againſt that diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
and continued their Synod, after that
the Marqueſs was gone away; and proceeded
in ſuch Laws and Decrees as they judged fit
for the preſent State: after which, they diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Synod, and publiſhed a Declaration
from <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to all ſincere and good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
in <hi>England</hi> concerning their innocencie
and intentions.</p>
            <p>The King, after a ſharp Proclamation againſt
the Scots, which he commanded to be read
in all Engliſh Churches, raiſed an Army to
ſubdue them by force; in which, the Nobles
and all Gentlemen his ſervants were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to attend him at <hi>York</hi> the firſt of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril,</hi>
with Horſe and Arms ſutable to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree:
the Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> was made Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49178:7"/>
and a rich and well-appointed Army at
that time and place attended the King.</p>
            <p>But the people of <hi>England</hi> in general ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred
that wicked War, as a deſigne to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave
both Nations; and loved the <hi>Scots</hi> as
brethren, perſecuted by the ſame power which
had long oppreſſed themſelves: they likewiſe
hoped that ſuch an occaſion might neceſſitate
the King to call a Parliament in <hi>England,</hi> ſo
long wanted there. But the King, while he
could make any other ſhift, how lowe ſoever,
and diſhonourable, would not endure to think
of a Parliament.</p>
            <p>The Covenanting Lords of <hi>Scotland</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
a Remonſtrance in anſwer to the Kings
Proclamation, and wiſely provided againſt all
Invaſions that might be made upon them on
any ſide: they ſeized the conſiderable Forts,
and diſarmed all ſuſpected perſons, without
any great trouble; electing Sir <hi>Alexander
Leſly,</hi> an old Souldier, for their General; to
whom all the Noble men were content to
give obedience: at which time, the King
commanded the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve;
and his command was obeyed.</p>
            <p>But the threatned War did not proceed: it
pleaſed God, that by the happie mediation of
ſome honeſt Lords of both Nations, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Conference granted, that the Pacification
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49178:8"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>

               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:49178:9"/>
was made and ſolemnly declared, on the 18
of <hi>June</hi> 1639. and both Armies were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded
within eight and fourty hours. The
King granted to the Scots a National Synod,
to begin upon the firſt of <hi>Auguſt</hi> following;
and a Parliament to begin on the 24 day of
the ſame month: ſo that both ſides peaceably
retreated home.</p>
            <p>But when the King had been but a little
time at <hi>London,</hi> his heart was again eſtranged
from the Scots, and thoughts of peace: He
commanded by Proclamation that Paper,
which the Scots avowed to contain the true
conditions of the Pacification, to be diſavow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and burnt by the hands of the Hangman:
and the honeſt people of both Nations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to fear another War. The King, about
the beginning of <hi>December,</hi> told the Lords of
his Council that he intended to call a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in <hi>England,</hi> to begin in <hi>April</hi> following;
which being ſpread among the people, made
them almoſt amazed; ſo ſtrange a thing was
the name of a Parliament grown. But ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
men did not like it, that it ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
ſo long, and that preparations for a
War with <hi>Scotland</hi> went on in the mean time.
They were likewiſe troubled, that the Earl of
<hi>Strafford,</hi> Deputy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> a man of deep
policie, but ſuſpected honeſty, one whom the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49178:9"/>
King then uſed as a boſom-Councellor, was
firſt to go into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and call a Parliament
in that Kingdom: beſides, the King at that
time had broken up the Parliament in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
which the Scots complained of, (the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
of State depending) as a great breach
of their Liberties, and againſt the Laws of
that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Upon which, they ſent ſome Lords into
<hi>England,</hi> to intreat the King to grant them a
redreſs of ſuch Injuries as they had received
ſince the Pacification: which were, That
their Parliament was broken off, before any
buſineſs done: That <hi>Edinburgh</hi>-Caſtle was
Gariſoned with far more Souldiers then were
needful: That <hi>Dun-Britain</hi>-Caſtle was Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned
with Engliſh Souldiers: That the Scots
that traded in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
to take new Oaths, contrary to their
Covenant, and altogether contrary to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Pacification. The King impriſoned
thoſe Lords, ſending one of them (the Earl
of <hi>Lowden)</hi> to the Tower, and commanded a
Charge of Treaſon to be drawn againſt him,
concerning a Letter which the Scotiſh Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters
had written to the King of <hi>France</hi>
for his aſſiſtance, and <hi>Lowden</hi> had ſubſcribed:
but the accuſation was frivolous, eaſily anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and came to nothing, becauſe thoſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49178:10"/>
were not ſent at all; and beſides, it was
before the Pacification, upon which an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion
of all things was agreed; although the
King at the beginning of the Engliſh Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
produced that Letter againſt them, as a
ground of his ſecond War: for now on the
thirteenth of <hi>April,</hi> the Parliament of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
was begun; before which time, the Earl
of <hi>Strafford</hi> was returned out of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
where he had held a Parliament, and gotten
four Subſidies.</p>
            <p>The King was very urgent with his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to give money to enable him for a War
againſt <hi>Scotland,</hi> and pay that Army and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
which he had already raiſed; he deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
twelve Subſidies of them, for which he
promiſed to releaſe Shipmoney: he promiſed
them that he would afterwards redreſs the
Kingdoms grievances, but deſired money
in the firſt place to go on with his deſigned
War.</p>
            <p>It was anſwered by many Members of the
Houſe in ſeveral Speeches, that redreſs of
Grievances was the chiefe end of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and ſhould go before Subſidies: <hi>That
the King asked a great ſumme of money for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſing
of that which he had no title to hold, but
had taken illegally by power:</hi> That the people
had no reaſon to pay for a War which they
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49178:10"/>
deſired not, but abhorred; a War not for
their good, but their own ruine: that nothing
was ſo juſt as to puniſh the contrivers of that
wicked War.</p>
            <p>But ſo ſtrange was the obedience and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance
of that Parliament towards the King,
that although the money which he asked
was againſt themſelves, yet they took the
Subſidies into conſideration; but while they
were debating, the King, whatſoever his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
were, whether he thought it a delay or
not, came into the Houſe on the fifth of <hi>May,</hi>
and diſſolved the Parliament. The people
were grieved in an extraordinary manner to
ſee this Parliament ſo ſuddenly broken up,
and as much to ſee the King break his word
ſo immmediately upon the diſſolution of it:
for he proteſted in the Houſe at that time,
that he would rule for the future as legally as
if a Parliament were conſtantly ſitting: Yet
nevertheleſs he impriſoned ſome Members
the next day after, Mr. <hi>Beloſis,</hi> Sir <hi>John Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham,</hi>
and M. <hi>Crew;</hi> he commanded the Lord
<hi>Brookes</hi> his Study, his Cabinet, and pockets
to be ſearched for Letters: He Commanded
the Convocation of Divines to continue their
ſitting, an unexampled thing, who by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
from him made Canons, and impoſed
Oaths upon the people, contrary to their Laws
and Liberties.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:49178:11"/>
The King to defray the charges of this
War, beſides the Contribution of the Clergy,
and Papiſts, iſſued out again Writs of Shipmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
in a greater proportion then before: he
ſeized the Bullion in the Tower, and took
up Commodities to be ſold again at an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate;
and conſulted about Coyning of braſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money;
but that went not forward.</p>
            <p>But the War went on; the Earl of <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
commanding in chiefe, the Earl of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland</hi>
not being in health, who had
been appointed General: but the Scots had
not been backward; for having been debarred
of their trade, and loſt their ſhips by ſeizure,
they entered into <hi>England</hi> with an Army, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
their intentions in writing to the
Engliſh, and bringing with them a Petition to
the King.</p>
            <p>But the King in this War found a greater
want then that of Money, which was the
hearts of the Souldiers, eſpecially the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Souldiers, who could not be eaſily
brought to engage againſt the Scots, as hating
the Cauſe; many of them mutinying againſt
their Officers and Commanders; which might
be one cauſe that the War proved not ſo
bloody and fatal as it was deſigned: ſome
Skirmiſhes, but not very conſiderable, happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at <hi>Newburn,</hi> and at <hi>Dunſian,</hi> not far from
<hi>Barwick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:49178:11"/>
Thus proceeded this unhappie buſineſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
ſome Engliſh Peers, Earls, and Barons, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
twenty, grieved at the diſhonour which
<hi>England</hi> ſuffered by the unhappie actions of
the King, made a Petition to him, declaring
in ſome part their former ſufferings by illegal
Government, the diſſolution of the laſt and
other Parliaments, the miſerable condicion of
the Kingdom at preſent, the ſad conſequence
of this wicked War; deſiring him to ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
a Parliament within ſome convenient
time, where the Kingdoms Grievances may
be redreſſed, this War compoſed, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of theſe wicked counſels puniſhed.</p>
            <p>Upon this Petition, the King cauſed all the
Lords to meet at <hi>York,</hi> on the 24. of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
And there told them his intention of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
a Parliament with all poſſible ſpeed;
which was to begin on the 3. of <hi>November.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was there alſo conſulted and debated
how to end this War upon fair termes: and
after ſome time ſpent between Lords choſen
out of both Nations, the matter was compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
according to theſe Articles.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. A Truce or ceſſation of Arms was made
for two moneths till the 16. of <hi>December.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. That 850. <hi>li.</hi> a day ſhould be paid to the
<hi>Scots,</hi> during that Truce.</item>
               <item>3. That if it were not paid, the <hi>Scots</hi> might
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49178:12"/>
force it from the Counties of <hi>Northumberland,
Cumberland, Weſtmerland,</hi> and <hi>Durham.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. That thoſe Counties ſhould be allowed the
<hi>Scots</hi> for their Winter-quarters.</item>
               <item>5. No new preparations for War, to be made.</item>
               <item>6. That private Injuries ſhould not break the
Truce, ſo ſatisfaction were made upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint.</item>
               <item>7. That Merchants might freely traffique in
either Kingdomes, without letters of ſafe conduct;
but Souldiers without leave might not paſs their
limits.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Thus was the ſtate of things altered, and
that VVar, which was intended for an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlavement
of both Nations, became the bond
of Concord between them, and the happie
cauſe which neceſſitated the King to call a
Parliament in <hi>England;</hi> whereby their juſt Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
might by the bleſſing of God be vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
and more aſcertained for the future.
Great was the expectation of this Engliſh
Parliament, on which the hopes of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were wholly fixed, as a certain cure of all
their long ſufferings; to which they thought
the King (having ſo much tranſgreſſed) could
not deny any thing, or make the leaſt oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
            <p>That was the cauſe for which they extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
loved the Scots, as the inſtruments of that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49178:12"/>
happineſs to them; who by reſiſting the
Kings intruſions upon themſelves, had enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
him to this viſible means of a cure for
<hi>England;</hi> which made the King more hate the
Scots, as the ſtoppers of his general deſign;
which hatred he could not conceal in his firſt
Speech that he made in this Parliament; in
which, promiſing all favour and concurrence
to any thing that might procure the happineſs
of <hi>England,</hi> and promiſing to put himſelf free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and wholly upon the love and affections of
his Engliſh Subjects in this Parliament, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed
againſt the Scots as Rebels, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
that by force of Arms they might be
chaſed out of <hi>England:</hi> but the Engliſh Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament
was of another affection towards the
Scots, as will appear more hereafter.</p>
            <p>The Parliament ſhewed a great and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
reſpect to the King, and in many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
gave him humble thanks for Calling
them together, without any reflection upon
his Perſon for what had paſſed in former miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>government;
but ſince no cure could be made
without ſearching wounds, and that grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
muſt be recited, they reſolved ſo to name
them, as to caſt the envy of them upon evil
Counſel, and ſtill mention the King with all
honour &amp; reverence poſſible; as will appear to
any that read the printed Speeches, which at
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49178:13"/>
the beginning of that Seſſion were made in
the Houſe by men of Eminency.</p>
            <p>Great was the buſineſs, and of various na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
were the crimes which this Parliament
were to examine, and finde out Delinquents,
whom ſo long a miſgovernment had made ſo.</p>
            <p>Many Committees were made by the Houſe
to eaſe them in this buſineſs: they began with
matters of Religion. Divers Miniſters who
had been of good lives and converſations,
conſcientious in their wayes, and diligent in
Preaching, and had by the Biſhops, and thoſe
in authority been moleſted, deprived, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned
for not conforming to ſome ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
which were impoſed on them, were now
by the Parliament relieved, and recompenſed
for their ſufferings. Others on the Contrary,
that had been ſcandalous, either for looſe and
wicked living, or elſe offenders in way of
ſuperſtition (both which, to diſcountenance
the Puritains, had been frequently preferred)
were cenſured and removed.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> Leiutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
was impeached of high Treaſon, and ſent pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
to the Tower of <hi>London:</hi> and on the
eighteenth day of <hi>December, William Laud,</hi>
Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> impeached of the
ſame crime, was committed to the ſame cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:49178:13"/>
The next day after the Archbiſhop was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached,
Dr. <hi>Wren,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Norwich</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
of many miſdemeanors in matter of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition
in his Eccleſiaſtical Government:
which tending to the detriment of the Civil
State, he was alſo accuſed of Treaſon, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into a recognizance of thirty thouſand
pounds to appear, with three ſureties bound,
each of them in obligations of ten thouſand
pounds. Sir <hi>Francis Windebank,</hi> Principal Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary
of State, a man neerly in friendſhip
with <hi>Laud</hi> the Archbiſhop, who was thought
to be a means of his preferment, was about
that time accuſed of extraordinary conniv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
toward Popiſh Prieſts, or rather of favor
to them; and that contrary to the Laws in
force againſt them, he had bailed and releaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a great number: a Committee was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to examine his offence, but he, conſcious
of the crime objected, and fearing the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
about the begining of <hi>December</hi> fled
in a diſguiſe, and went into <hi>France.</hi> Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
after his flight, the Lord Keeper <hi>Finch</hi>
was conſtrained to take the ſame courſe, and
fled out of the Kingdom into <hi>Holland:</hi> the
crimes objected againſt him were of a various
nature.</p>
            <p>The firſt committed when he was Speaker
of Parliament in the Houſe of Commons in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49178:14"/>
the fourth year of King <hi>Charles:</hi> which was,
for that he diſobeyed the Houſe, in refuſing to
ſpeak when he was commanded by them.</p>
            <p>2. The ſecond was for giving illegal and cruel
judgements in the Forreſt-buſineſs, when he
was Lord Chief Juſtice of the Common Pleas.</p>
            <p>3. The third was for threatning of ſome of
the Judges at that time, to give their extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
opinions for Ship-mony.</p>
            <p>The laſt was for drawing an injurious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
after the diſſolution of the laſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament:
for which Offences he was Voted
by the Houſe of Commons guilty of high
Treaſon; a Charge drawn up againſt him, and
carried up to the Lords upon the 14 of <hi>Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi>
three weeks after his flight.</p>
            <p>Upon the 15 of <hi>February</hi> 1640. a Bill for
the Triennial Parliament was preſented to
the King, and by him ſigned: which Act be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

And in caſe any perſon ſhall be ſo hardy as to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe,

ſhall incur the penalties following (that is to ſay)
every County the ſum of one thouſand pounds, and
every City which is no County, two hundred
pounds, and every Cinque-Port and Borough the
ſum of one hundred pounds. All and every of
which ſeveral forfeitures, and all other forfeitures
in this Act mentioned, ſhall and may be recovered
in any of the Kings Courts of Record at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi>
by and in the Name of the Lord Major

            <p>The fifth part of all and every the forfeitures in

one of themſelves to be Speaker for the ſaid

Commons aſſembled in the ſaid Parliament, as they
ſhall think fit.</p>
            <p>And it is further enacted, That all Parliaments
hereafter to be aſſembled by authority of this Act,
and every Member thereof, ſhall have and enjoy
all Rights, Priviledges, Juriſdictions, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities,
as any Parliament ſummoned by Writ
under the great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> or any Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
thereof might, or ought to have, and have
voices in ſuch Parliament, before, and without
the taking of the ſeveral Oaths of Supremacy and

to the contrary thereof in any wiſe notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
            <p>For Signing of this Bill, thanks were given
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49178:19"/>
to the King at <hi>White-hall</hi> the ſame afternoon
by both Houſes of Parliament.</p>
            <p>By this time, being the end of <hi>December,</hi>
that Ceſſation of Arms which was ſpoken of
before, between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
was expired, and by the Parliament
now renewed for a month longer; for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
although the King (as is ſaid before)
called them Rebels, and deſired to have them
driven out of <hi>England,</hi> had a better opinion
of them, and at this time of renewing the
Ceſſation, ordered that the <hi>Scots</hi> ſhould be
recompenſed for all their charges and loſſes
by that miſchievous war which the King had
raiſed againſt them; and within few dayes, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
examination of thoſe loſſes and charges,
the Parliament ordered that the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Ships,
taken ſince that war, ſhould be reſtored to
them, and 4000. l. in money given them to rig
thoſe ſhips: it was further reſolved by both
Houſes, that the full ſum of 300000 l. ſhould
be given to them, in theſe words, <hi>Towards a
ſupply of the loſſes and neceſſities of our brethren
of Scotland;</hi> And that the Parliament would
in due time take into conſideration the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of raiſing, &amp; daies of Paiment; for which,
three daies after, the Scotiſh Commiſſioners,
then Reſident at <hi>London,</hi> gave thanks to the
Parliament, not only for that great Sum of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49178:19"/>
300000. l. but for the ſtile of Brethren which
ſo kindly they had uſed towards them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Parliament of</hi> England, <hi>as a further
ſtrengthning of the Nations amity, Ordained
at that time,</hi> That all Books, Libels, and Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
againſt the Scots ſhould be called in; and
a thanksgiving to God ſhould be in all Churches of
<hi>England</hi> for that happy Peace.</p>
            <p>The payment of two Armies for ſo long a
time was a great charge to the poor people of
<hi>England;</hi> which they without any grudging
or repining at the King, as cauſe of that great
burden, in hope to gain him for the future,
bore with exceeding patience; they willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
parted with ſix Subſidies, and were content
with the taxation of Poll-money, a perſonal
aſſeſſment of the whole Kingdom, wherein
every Duke was aſſeſſed at 100. l. a Marqueſs
at 80. l. Earls at 60. l. Viſcounts and Barons
at 40. l. Knights of the Bath at 30. l. Other
Knights at 20. l. Eſquires at 10. l. Men of
100. l. <hi>per annum</hi> at 5. l. every common head
at ſix pence.</p>
            <p>The King in <hi>February</hi> had declared to the
Houſes his intention concerning a marriage
for his eldeſt Daughter, the Princeſs <hi>Mary,</hi>
who was then betwixt 9 and 10 yeers of age;
the husband appointed for her, was the yong
Prince <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> Son to <hi>Henry</hi> Prince
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49178:20"/>
of <hi>Orange,</hi> a youth about 16 yeers of age: the
matter was then in agitation, and fair Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,
made upon it to the King, by the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors
of the States General: The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were pleaſed with the marriage; and
not long after the yong Prince arived in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and was by the King and Queen, with
all the Court, joyfully received, and entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
at <hi>London.</hi> After convenient time ſpent
in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court, he was upon the ſecond
day of <hi>May,</hi> with great ſolemnity, Married at
<hi>White-hall</hi> to the Princeſs <hi>Mary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the tenth day of <hi>May, Thomas</hi> Earl of
<hi>Strafford,</hi> who had been committed to the
Tower ſix months before, was beheaded. Of
this man, of the crimes laid to his charge, as
likewiſe of his Pompous and remarkable trial,
we cannot but make ſome mention. About
the end of <hi>January</hi> a charge was read againſt
him in the Houſe of Commons, conſiſting of
nine Articles: out of which by ſubdiviſion
were branched many more, which (though
too tedious to be verbally here ſet down) I
ſhall deliver, by expreſſing the contents. He
was accuſed for ruling <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the North
of <hi>England</hi> in an arbitrary way, againſt the
Laws. For retaining the Kings revenue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
account. For encreaſing and encouraging
Popery. For maliciouſly ſtriving to ſtir up,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49178:20"/>
and continue enmity betwixt <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Scotland;</hi> of which ſome particulars are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt.
For laboring to ſubvert Parliaments,
and incenſe the King againſt them. Upon
which occaſion, Mr. <hi>Pym,</hi> a Member of the
Houſe of Commons, in his Speech and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
to the Lords, ſhewing the quality of
the offence, ſpake as followeth: <q>It is an
offence comprehending all other offences, in
that he governed contrary to Law: the Law
is that which puts a difference between
good and evil.</q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>It is the Law that doth intitle the King to
the Allegeance and ſervice of his people; it
intitles the people to the protection and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
of the King. It is God alone who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
by himſelf, all other things ſubſiſt in a
mutual dependence and relation. He was
a wiſe man that ſaid, That the King ſubſiſted
by the field that is tilled: it is the labor of
the people that ſupports the Crown: If you
take away the protection of the King, the
vigor and cheerfulneſs of Allegeance will be
taken away, though the obligation remain.</p>
               <p>The Law is the Boundary, the Meaſure
betwixt the Kings Prerogative and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Liberty: Whiles theſe move in their own
Orb, they are a ſupport and ſecurity to one
another; The Prerogative a cover and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49178:21"/>
to the Liberty of the people, and the
people by their Liberty are enabled to be a
foundation to the Prerogative; but if theſe
bounds be ſo removed, that they enter into
conteſtation and conflict, one of theſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
muſt needs enſue: If the Prerogative
of the King overwhelm the Liberty of the
People, it will be turned into Tyranny; If
Liberty undermine the Prerogative, it will
grow into Anarchy.</p>
               <p>The Law is the ſafeguard, the cuſtody of
all private intereſt: Your Honors, your
Lives, your Liberties and Eſtates are all in
the keeping of the Law; without this, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man hath a like right to any thing, and
this is the condition into which the Iriſh
were brought by the Earl of <hi>Strafford:</hi> And
the reaſon which he gave for it, hath more
miſchief in it than the thing it ſelf, THEY
WERE A CONQUERED NA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION.
There cannot be a word more
pregnant and fruitful in Treaſon, than that
word is: There are few Nations in the
world that have not been Conquered; and
no doubt but the Conqueror may give what
Laws he pleaſe to thoſe that are Conquered:
But if the ſucceeding Pacts and Agreements
do not limit and reſtrain that right, what
people can be ſecure? <hi>England</hi> hath been
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49178:21"/>
Conquered, and <hi>Wales</hi> hath been Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
and by this reaſon will be in little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
caſe than <hi>Ireland.</hi> If the King by the
Right of a Conqueror gives Laws to his
people; ſhall not the people by the ſame
reaſon be reſtored to the right of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered,
to recover their Liberty if they can?
What can be more hurtful, more pernitious
to both, than ſuch Propoſitions as theſe?</p>
            </q>
            <p>A little after: <q>Such <hi>arbitrary</hi> power is
inconſiſtent with the peace, the wealth, the
proſperity of a Nation; to induſtry, to valor,
&amp;c. For who will take pains for that which
when he hath gotten, is not his own? Or,
who will fight for that wherein he hath no
other Intereſt, but ſuch as is ſubject to the
will of another? The ancient encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for men to defend their Countries,
was this, That they were to hazard their
perſons in defence of their Religion and
their Houſes; but by ſuch <hi>arbitrary</hi> wayes as
were practiſed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and counſelled
here, no man had any certainty of either,
or of any thing elſe, &amp;c. Such <hi>arbitrary</hi>
courſes have an ill operation on the courage
of a Nation, by embaſing the hearts of the
people; a ſervil condition doth beget in men
a ſlaves temper and diſpoſition: ſhall it be
Treaſon to embaſe the Kings Coyn, though
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49178:22"/>
but a piece; and muſt it not needs be the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of a greater Treaſon, to embaſe the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of his Subjects? &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>A little further: <q>As it is a Crime odious
in the nature of it, ſo it is odious in the
judgment and eſtimation of the Law; to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the ſettled frame and conſtitution of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
is Treaſon in any eſtate; The
Laws whereby all other parts of a Kingdom
are preſerved, ſhould be very vain and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective,
if they had not a power to ſecure
and preſerve themſelves.</q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>The forfeitures inflicted for Treaſon by
our Law, are of Life, Honor, and Eſtate,
even all that can be forfeited; and this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
having committed ſo many Treaſons,
although he ſhould pay all theſe forfeitures,
will be ſtill a Debtor to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth:
Nothing can be more equal, then
that he ſhould periſh by the Juſtice of that
Law which he would have ſubverted. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will this be a new way of blood;
There are marks enough to trace this Law
to the very original of this Kingdom: And
if it hath not been put in execution, as he
allegeth, this 240 yeers, it was not for want
of Law, but that all that time hath not bred
a man bold enough to commit ſuch Crimes
as theſe; which is a circumſtance much ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49178:22"/>
his offence, and making him no
whit leſs liable to puriſhment, becauſe he
is the only man that in ſo long a time hath
ventured upon ſuch a Treaſon as this.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The Commiſſioners of <hi>Scotland,</hi> then reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
at <hi>London,</hi> had a charge alſo againſt this
Earl, for matters done againſt their Nation;
which were notwithſtanding implied in the
Parliaments Charge. To this Charge the Earl
gave in his Anſwer in the Houſe of Lords,
where the King himſelf was preſent at the
reading of it, upon the 23 day of <hi>February;</hi>
but his trial in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Hall began on the
22 day of <hi>March</hi> following, and was a moſt
memorable fight. The <hi>Hall</hi> was Scaffolded
on both ſides, to contain the whole Houſe
of Commons, ſitting there in a Committee;
the Peers ſate all there, beſides the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
from <hi>Scotland,</hi> and beſides other
ſpectators and auditors, and a great number
of the Lords of <hi>Ireland.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi>
was Lord high Steward, and the Earl of <hi>Lind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey</hi>
Lord high Conſtable: the King himſelf ſate
privately in a cloſe Gallery every day, taking
Notes in writing of what paſſed in the tryal.
Fifteen dayes the Earl anſwered perſonally,
from the 22 of <hi>March,</hi> with few dayes inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
till the 16 of <hi>April.</hi> Miſdemeanors
in an high degree were proved againſt him,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49178:23"/>
but that which the Earl labored to maintain
for himſelf, was, that Miſdemeanors, though
never ſo many and great, could not make
Treaſon, put together, unleſs ſome one of
them in his own nature had been Treaſon:
for that was his Charge, which he ſtrove to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void.</p>
            <p>Yet many of thoſe particulars in his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
were put into his Bill of Attainder af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward;
for a Bill of Attainder was drawn
up, and read againſt him in the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
<hi>April</hi> 21. where he was Voted guilty
of high Treaſon.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Saint John</hi> the Kings Sollicitor, and a
Member of the Houſe of Commons, on the
29 of <hi>April,</hi> for ſatisfaction of the Lords,
opened the Bill in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-Hall (where the
Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> was at the Bar, and the King
preſent in his accuſtomed place) and made
the Bill good by many precedent Statutes.
Upon which the Lords, being ſomewhat ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
were afterwards more confirmed, when
the Judges, in their Houſe, delivered their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
concerning it; And voted him guilty
of high Treaſon alſo. But the King told the
Lords, he was not ſatisfied in Conſcience, to
condemn him of high Treaſon; But acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
that his miſdemeanors were very
great; until at laſt, wearied with Petitions
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49178:23"/>
for Juſtice, the King calling a Privy Councel
at <hi>White-hall,</hi> commanded the Judges to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
their opinion before him there; and ſent
for ſome Biſhops to reſolve him in ſcruple of
Conſcience. Which wrought ſo, that he gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a Commiſſion to four Lords, to ſign that
Bill for execution of the Earl of <hi>Strafford;</hi>
which execution was done at the time and
place before mentioned.</p>
            <p>The death of this great Earl ſeemed to be
the more violently ſought, and more haſtened,
by reaſon of ſome Treaſons againſt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which were at that time diſcovered;
being partly in favor of him, contrived to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
his death by an eſcape out of the Tower.</p>
            <p>For one part of this Treaſon was to that
purpoſe. Souldiers were raiſed by Sir <hi>John
Suckling,</hi> and ſome others, under pretence of
ſervice in <hi>Portugal,</hi> to gratifie the Embaſſador
of that Kingdom; thoſe Souldiers the King
himſelf (who was now found to be privy to
all thoſe Treaſons againſt the Parliament)
commanded Sir <hi>William Belfore</hi> the Lieutenant
to admit into the Tower; but he perceiving
it was a Plot for the Earls eſcape, diſobeyed
the Kings Command. Another part of this
Treaſon, chief of all the reſt, was a deſign to
bring up the Engliſh Army, which was in the
North, and not yet disbanded; this Army
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49178:24"/>
they had dealt with to engage againſt the
Parliament ſitting, and (as they alleaged) to
maintain the Kings Prerogative, Epiſcopacy,
and other things againſt the Parliament it
ſelf. In this Plot were <hi>Henry Piercy,</hi> brother
to the Earl of <hi>Northumberland;</hi> Mr. <hi>Henry
Jermin,</hi> Maſter of the Horſe to the Queen;
Col. <hi>Goring,</hi> Col. <hi>Wilmot,</hi> Col. <hi>Aſhburnham,
Pollard, Suckling,</hi> and others: the Kings diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
to Mr. <hi>Piercy</hi> concerning theſe things
were diſcovered in a Letter of <hi>Piercie's</hi> to his
Brother <hi>Northumberland</hi> out of <hi>France,</hi> which
was read in the Houſe upon the 14 of <hi>June</hi>
(for <hi>Piercy, Jermine,</hi> and <hi>Suckling</hi> at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of <hi>May,</hi> when this Treaſon was in
ſome part detected, fled the day before they
ſhould have been examined, and paſſed over
into <hi>France)</hi> upon which reading, <hi>Wilmot,
Aſhburnham</hi> and <hi>Pollard,</hi> three Members of
the Houſe, mentioned in the Letter, as privy
to the Plot, were all committed: If the Earl
of <hi>Strafford</hi> had eſcaped out of the Tower, he
ſhould have Commanded, in aid to this Plot,
that Iriſh Army, conſiſting of eight thouſand,
moſt of them Papiſts, which the King would
not grant to have disbanded, when the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
on the 28 of <hi>April</hi> before had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
it of him; but told them he could not
disband them, for reaſons beſt known to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:49178:24"/>
Colonel <hi>Goring,</hi> for ſome diſcoveries which
he made, was not at all committed; but
<hi>Oneale,</hi> an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſt, that was deep in the
Plot, was apprehended and committed to
the Tower, from whence he afterwards e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped.</p>
            <p>The Parliament finding ſuch diſturbance in
their buſineſs, and treaſons againſt them, and
not at all aſſured of the Kings reality; weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
beſides the great charges of paying two
Armies, for which money muſt be raiſed by
Loan upon the publick Faith: moved the
King to ſign a Bill for continuation of this
preſent Parliament; which was, That it ſhould
never be diſſolved without the Conſent of
both Houſes.</p>
            <p>That Bill ſo drawn up, the King ſigned on
the 10 of <hi>May,</hi> the ſame day that he ſigned
the Bill for <hi>Straffords</hi> execution.</p>
            <p>This Bill was a thing, that former ages had
not ſeen the like of, and therefore extremely
was the Kings Grace magnified by thoſe that
flattered, but much condemned by others,
who hated Parliaments and Reformation,
complaining that the King had too far put the
ſtaffe out of his own hands. But many men
who ſaw the neceſſity of ſuch a thing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which no money upon the publick Faith
could be borrowed, did not at all wonder at
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49178:25"/>
it, ſaying, That as no King ever granted the
like before; ſo no King had ever before made
ſo great a neceſſity to require it: but ſome
men were of opinion that it was not of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
enough to make the Kingdom happy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
the King were good; for if he were ill-affected,
he had power enough ſtill to hinder,
and retard them in any proceeding for the
good, and ſettlement of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth;
and ſo by time and delayes lay a
greater <hi>Odium</hi> upon the Parliament, for not
ſatisfying the peoples deſires, then if they
had not had that ſeeming power to have done
it: Which proved in the concluſion too true,
when the King by ſuch protraction of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
not at all concurring with them in the
main, had raiſed a party to himſelf againſt
them, to cut aſunder that Knot by the ſword,
which by Law he could not unty.</p>
            <p>The Parliament after this, began with
eaſing the Kingdoms Grievances; and becauſe
the charge of the two Armies lay upon them,
and every day was conſiderable, till they were
disbanded, that was the firſt thing intended;
Towards which a great quantity of Plate was
appointed, with more than ordinary haſte to
be melted and coined.</p>
            <p>And for making up the ſum, that Bill of
Poll-money was to be ſigned, which was ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49178:25"/>
to the King, and two other Bills with it,
one for putting down the High-Commiſſion
Court; and the other for putting down the
Star-Chamber.</p>
            <p>The King ſigned only that Bill of Poll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money,
and took time to conſider of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
two: but hearing how ill it was taken
at his hands, what murmurings there were
in the City; and thinking it not now ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to diſtaſte them much, three days after
he came and paſſed thoſe other two Bills for
putting down the High Commiſſion Court,
and Star-Chamber.</p>
            <p>The Queen-Mother of <hi>France</hi> about that
time took her leave of the King, &amp; paſſed over
the Seas into <hi>Holland,</hi> the people deſiring to
be eaſed of that charge; for the King had kept
her for the ſpace of three years in <hi>England</hi> at
the allowance of 100. l. a day.</p>
            <p>The Parliament proceeded then againſt the
delinquent Judges about Ship-money; and
Charges were drawn up and read againſt them
in the Houſe of Commons: for in <hi>December</hi>
before, when the debate had been concerning
Ship-money, and the offence of thoſe Judges
who had given their extrajudicial opinions
for it, was examined; upon which the Lord
Keeper <hi>Finch</hi> fled; the thing was condemned
as moſt illegal. Three Judges had been ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:49178:26"/>
Judge <hi>Crook, Hutton,</hi> and Baron <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
whoſe Arguments were very famous:
the other were examined by ſixteen Members
of the Houſe of Commons, who were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to preſent thoſe particular Charges
againſt every Judge; who were, Judge <hi>Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,</hi>
Baron <hi>Trever,</hi> Baron <hi>Weſton,</hi> Baron <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venport,</hi>
and Judge <hi>Crawley;</hi> for Judge <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay</hi>
was charged with high Treaſon.</p>
            <p>Of this, a certain Gent. ſpake as followeth;
<q>The Root of moſt of our preſent miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs,
&amp; the ruine of all poſterity, do I hold
to be that extrajudicial (Judgment I cannot
ſay, but rather) doom, delivered by all the
Judges under their hands out of Court, yet
recorded in all Courts, to the ſubverſion of
all our Fundamental Lawes, Liberties; and
Annihilation, if not Confiſcation of our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates:
That in caſe of danger, the King may
impoſe upon his ſubjects, &amp; that he is the ſole
Judge of the danger, neceſſity, and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
which in brief, is to take what, when,
and where he will; which though delivered
in the time of a gracious &amp; merciful Prince,
who we hope will not wreſt it beyond our
abilities, yet left to the interpretation of a
ſucceeding Tyrant, if ever this Nation be
ſo fortunate to fall into the hands of ſuch;
It is a Record wherein every man might
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:49178:26"/>
read himſelf a ſlave that reads it, having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
he can call his own, all proſtitute to
the will of another.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>What to do in ſuch a caſe, we are not to
ſeek for precedents, our honorable Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors
taught us in the juſt and exemplar pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
of chief <hi>Justice Treſilian</hi> and his
Complices (for giving their <hi>judgments</hi> out
of <hi>Parliament</hi> againſt the eſtabliſhed <hi>Laws</hi> of
<hi>Parl.)</hi> how tender they were of us, how care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
we ought to be to continue thoſe Laws,
to preſerve the Liberty of our Poſterity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe Charges were now brought in about
the beginning of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> but little was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
done againſt any of them, or almoſt
any other offendor: the King had deſigned a
journey into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and would go, though
the Houſes earneſtly entreated his ſtay for a
while longer, becauſe the Kingdoms buſineſs
required his preſence; the King alledged that
the affairs of <hi>Scotland</hi> did neceſſarily require
his preſence: and further told them that he
would Paſs any good Bill, which they had for
him, before he went. Which he accordingly
did, and ſigned a Commiſſion for paſſing of
Bills in his abſence; the Commiſſioners were
the Lord-Keeper <hi>Littleton,</hi> the Lord Privy-ſeal
Earl of <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> the Lord great Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain
Earl of <hi>Lindſey,</hi> the Marqueſs of <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:49178:27"/>
Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> Earl of <hi>Bath,</hi> Earl of <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet;</hi>
The Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> alſo by a Bill, which
the King then ſigned, was made General of
all his forces on this ſide Trent, with power
to levy Arms in caſe of neceſſity.</p>
            <p>But before the King went, the Earl of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
choſen both by him and the Parliament
as General for that purpoſe, was gone into
the North to disband the Engliſh Army
there.</p>
            <p>The King departing from <hi>London</hi> the tenth
of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> made haſte towards <hi>Scotland,</hi> and
paſſed by the Armies as they were disban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
Whether he did under-hand at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
any thing with the Scotiſh Army (as a
Scotiſh writer hath publiſhed) to engage
them againſt the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> with
large promiſes of Spoil, and offering Jewels
of great value in pawn for performance of it,
I leave as uncertain, for the reader to judge,
by what afterwards fell out. But if he did, it
was a matter of great falſehood, having as
yet declared no enmity againſt the Engliſh
Parliament. But what the Kings deſign was
of going into <hi>Scotland,</hi> was not underſtood
in <hi>England.</hi> The ſame Author ſaies, it was to
make ſure thoſe Noble men of that Kingdom,
whom he doubted of, as not willing to ſerve
his turn againſt <hi>England.</hi> And true it is, that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49178:27"/>
about <hi>September,</hi> Letters came from <hi>Scotland</hi>
to the ſtanding Committee at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> (for
the two Houſes had rejourned themſelves
from the eighth of <hi>September,</hi> till the twentieth
of <hi>October,</hi> and appointed a ſtanding Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
of fifty Members during that time)
that a Treaſonable Plot was diſcovered there
againſt the lives of ſome of the greateſt Peers
in the Kingdom; upon which the ſtanding
Committee fearing ſome miſchief from the
ſame ſpring, placed ſtrong guards in divers
parts of the City of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However the miſchiefs might fall out by
chance, or by deſign, the Kings journey into
<hi>Scotland</hi> was ſure to hinder the Engliſh buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and to retard the cure of all their Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances;
which was little leſs then a plain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.
For after the tenth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the
day of his departure, little was done in the
Parliament, until the receſs.</p>
            <p>On the 23 of <hi>October,</hi> whilſt the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> broke forth that curſed
conſpiracy of the Iriſh Rebels, and the inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
butchery of Proteſtants through the
whole Iſland, more tragical then any effect of
a calamitous War; in which was put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
whatſoever could be imagined from
the licentious cruelty of a barbarous people,
ſo long kept under the Engliſh yoke, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49178:28"/>
the dire dictates of ſuperſtition, or
wicked exhortations of Prieſts could infuſe
into them. It was wonderful that ſo deviliſh a
deſign could ſo long be kept cloſe; whereby
200000 Proteſtants in two months ſpace
were murdered, and many by exquiſite tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and many more deſpoiled of all their
wordly fortunes.</p>
            <p>This diveliſh deſign was to be put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
on the 23 of <hi>October;</hi> upon which day
not only the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> the Kingdoms
chief Magazine, a ſtorehouſe of ten thouſand
Arms at that time; but all other Forts and
Magazines in that Kingdom were to be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed;
and all the Engliſh or Proteſtants,
that joyned not with them, to be murdered.</p>
            <p>The ſeizure of <hi>Dublin</hi> Caſtle (to which
purpoſe many of the chief Rebels came to
the City the day before) was prevented by
timely diſcovery of the Plot to the two Lords
Juſtices, by one <hi>Owen O Conally,</hi> a Servant to
Sir <hi>John Clotworthy;</hi> which diſcovery was but
the very night before that fatal day, and the
occaſion of it very accidental (or rather, a
ſtrange providence of God) by <hi>Mac-Mahons</hi>
unadviſed truſting this <hi>Owen</hi> with ſome rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
concerning it at a Tavern.</p>
            <p>Upon which diſcovery, <hi>Mac-Mahon,</hi> and
the Lord <hi>Maguire</hi> were preſently apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49178:28"/>
by the Lords Juſtices; and many Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators
of great note eſcaped that night out of
<hi>Dublin.</hi> So was <hi>Dublin</hi> ſaved, that all <hi>Ireland</hi>
might not be loſt in one day. But the horrid
deſign was paſt prevention, as to the general;
for the Conſpirators were up at the day in all
Counties round about; and poor Engliſh
Proteſtants arrived at <hi>Dublin</hi> every day, rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
and ſpoiled of all they had, relating how
their houſes were ſeized, how Towns and
Villages in all parts were fired, and cruel out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages
committed.</p>
            <p>The Lords Juſtices, Sir <hi>William Parſons,</hi> and
Sir <hi>John Burlace</hi> taking thoſe Arms which
they found in <hi>Dublin,</hi> and arming whom they
could on a ſudden to defend themſelves, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatched
Letters to the King in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and
the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> then choſen Deputy, but
ſtaying in <hi>England.</hi> Money was wanting, and
no ſupplies neerer then <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Owen O Conally,</hi> the firſt diſcoverer of the
Plot, brought the firſt Letters to <hi>London;</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
receipt of which, they rewarded <hi>Owen</hi> with
a gift of 500.l. and an annuity of two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
pounds <hi>per annum;</hi> and preſently both
Houſes of Parliament met at a Conference,
and the Houſe of Commons forthwith reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
into a Committee, to conſider of <hi>Irelands</hi>
relief, and alſo to provide for the ſafety of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49178:29"/>
               <hi>England,</hi> for diſtractions began then to appear
in <hi>England;</hi> the Parliament every day con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
of <hi>Irelands</hi> relief, and preſently orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
ſupplies of money to be borrowed of the
City of <hi>London,</hi> Victuals, and Ammunition
for that purpoſe. But all relief could be but
slow in ſuch a ſudden diſeaſe. For the Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
encreaſed, and ſpread through all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
and many Papiſts and ill-affected fled
from <hi>Dublin</hi> into the Country to joyn with
the Rebels, whileſt the City in their rooms,
was daily filled with poor ſpoiled Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,
who came naked, and famiſhed thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
many of them being paſt relief, and
there periſhed in the City. It were an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
thing to relate the pitiful condition of
thoſe woful people, and what ſad ſtories they
there told concerning the bloody rage of
thoſe inhumane Iriſh Rebels, and ſeveral
tortures by which the unhappy Engliſh were
brought to their ends.</p>
            <p>But the Lords of the Councel, and Lords
Juſtices in a ſhort time, with thoſe Arms of
<hi>Dublin,</hi> had armed many well-affected
Gentlemen, and ſent many active Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
out of the City to defend places neer,
againſt the approach of the Rebels. About
the middle of <hi>November</hi> were in Arms Sir
<hi>Charles Coot,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Tichburn,</hi> the Lord
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49178:29"/>
               <hi>Lambert,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Lucas,</hi> Capt. <hi>Armſtrong,</hi>
Capt. <hi>Yarner;</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi> came to
<hi>Dublin</hi> with an hundred Horſe well armed.
At which time the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi>
till greater ſums could be raiſed, ſent them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
as a preſent comfort, twenty thouſand
pounds. But it was a long time before they
could ſend over any forces to the relief of
that bleeding Kingdom; the firſt was a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
Commanded by Sir <hi>Simon Harcourt,</hi>
who arrived on the laſt of <hi>December,</hi> 1641.</p>
            <p>While <hi>Ireland</hi> was thus miſerably diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
the King returned out of <hi>Scotland</hi> into
<hi>England,</hi> and was entertained by the City of
<hi>London</hi> with moſt pompous ſolemnity; the
whole multitude of Citizens diſtinguiſhed by
their ſeveral Companies, in ſuch coſtly Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page
as never before was known, with Horſe
and Arms met the King, and guarded him
through the whole City to his Palace at
<hi>White-hall.</hi> Some condemned that coſtly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
of the City at ſuch a ſad time;
others hoped it might gain the Kings dubious
affection to his people; but it wrought a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
effect in the King; who began now to
think he could never loſe the love of the
City, whatſoever he did; and was flattered
by ſome, with a hope that the City would
aſſiſt him in curbing of the Parliament it ſelf;
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:49178:30"/>
he grew therefore more diſdainful toward the
Parliament; and to endear the City, invited
divers of the chief to <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, where
he feaſted them, and Knighted ſome.</p>
            <p>But the honeſt Citizens perceiving that no
good uſe was made of their dutiful expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
toward the King, but that ſome bad
people did openly ſay that the City were
weary of the Parliament, and would joyn
with the King againſt it; they framed a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
to the Parliament, wherein the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is profeſſed; and that they would live and
die with the Parliament for the good of the
Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>While the King remained at <hi>Hampton</hi>
Court, the Houſe of Commons preſented him
with a Remonſtrance, wherein the Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
of the Kingdom are expreſſed; but
no fault laid upon himſelf in plain words, but
a Malignant party (as they call them) and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Counſellors.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Irelands</hi> calamities ſeemed to be quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
or rather, that thoſe inhumane Rebels
were countenanced; every body wondring
that the King would not proclaim them Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels;
and ſome honeſt Lords adviſing the
King to proclaim them ſpeedily, that a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
courſe might be taken againſt them; they
deſired him to waſh off that foul ſtain from
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49178:30"/>
himſelf, by proceeding ſeverely againſt thoſe
wicked villains; who reported every where
that they had authority from him to ſeize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Holds of the Engliſh Proteſtants;
that they were the Queens Souldiers, and riſe
to maintain the Kings Prerogative againſt the
Puritan Parliament in <hi>England;</hi> they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
adviſed him by all means to purge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
of that crime; then which, a greater on
earth could not be.</p>
            <p>But ſo ſtrangely were things carried, that
although the Rebellion brake out upon the
twenty third of <hi>October,</hi> the King did not
proclaim them Rebels till the firſt of <hi>Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary;</hi>
and then gave a ſtrict command, that
no more then forty Copies of that Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſhould be Printed, and that none of
them ſhould be publiſhed, till his Majeſties
pleaſure were further ſignified, ſo that a few
only could take notice of it; which made all
men extreamly wonder, when they obſerved
the late contrary proceedings againſt the
Scots; who were in a very quick and ſharp
manner proclaimed, and thoſe Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
forthwith diſperſed with as much dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
as might be thorow all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>But before this Proclamation came out,
the Parliament, being ſomewhat troubled
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49178:31"/>
with ſome ſpeeches, of which they had been
informed, as if a Plot were contrived againſt
them, deſired the King to allow them a Guard
for ſecurity of their perſons and that the
Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> then Lord <hi>Chamberlain</hi> of his
Majeſties Houſhold, might be Commander
of it. But the King denied them a Guard,
giving them many fair promiſes of his care
for their ſafety; and that he would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
ſuch a Guard to wait upon them, as
he would be reſponſible for to Almighty
God.</p>
            <p>Three days after the Proclamation againſt
thoſe Iriſh Rebels, being the fourth of <hi>Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi>
the King attended with about three
hundred Armed Gentlemen, came to <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi>
and entring in Perſon into the Houſe
of Commons, and ſeating himſelf in the
Speakers Chair, demanded five Members of
that Houſe to be delivered to him; Mr. <hi>Hollis,</hi>
Sir <hi>Arthur Haſlerig,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pym,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hamden,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Strode.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe five Members had by command of
the Houſe, upon information of the Kings
intent, abſented themſelves. Which the
King finding, went away after a ſhort Speech
delivered, concerning them, That he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
a fair Trial againſt them, and that he
was, and would be as careful to maintain the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49178:31"/>
Priviledges of Parliament, as ever any King
of <hi>England</hi> was. He had the day before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them by his Atturney, Sir <hi>Edward
Herbert,</hi> a Member of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
pretending a Charge of high Treaſon
againſt them, and with them, againſt the Lord
<hi>Mandevile,</hi> a Member of the Houſe of Lords.
But the Parliament did not think fit to let
their Perſons go. Whereupon the King ſent
and ſealed up the Cloſets and Trunks of thoſe
five Members; He made alſo a Proclamation
againſt them, for their apprehending and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment,
as men guilty of high Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>This great breach of Parliament-Priviledge
happened in a ſtrange time, to divert the
Kingdom from relieving of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and ſo
the people every where complained, and
called to minde what they had heard by ſome
of thoſe poor Proteſtants, who fled out of
<hi>Ireland;</hi> who reported that thoſe Iriſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
did confidently ſay, It was for no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to ſly for ſafety into <hi>England,</hi> for that
Kingdom would be as much diſtreſſed as
theirs, and that the King intended to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
his Parliament in <hi>England,</hi> and War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it; which when he did, they would
come over, having done their work in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and help the King againſt the Engliſh
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49178:32"/>
Parliament. Thoſe things were ſadly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>On this occaſion the Parliament voted,
that</hi> Theſe things were an high breach of the
Priviledge of Parliament, a great ſcandal to
the King and his Government, a ſeditious act,
manifeſtly tending to the ſubverſion of the peace,
and an injury and diſhonor to the ſaid Members,
there being no legal Charge or accuſation againſt
them. And that there could be no vindication of
thoſe Priviledges, unleſs his Majeſty would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the Names of thoſe who adviſed him to
ſuch unlawful courſes. <hi>They therefore deſired
him to ſatisfie their legal deſire in that, to let
them know their informers (which by two
Statutes then in force, upon ſuch occaſions
the King is bound to do) but he refuſed to
grant their requeſt. Upon which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
his Atturney, Sir</hi> Edward Herbert,
<hi>(having been examined about it, but confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
nothing) for breaking the Priviledges of
Parliament in prefering the Articles, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King the next day after this, entering
into the Houſe of Commons, went through
the City of <hi>London;</hi> where the Citizens in
many places, flocking about his Coach, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
entreated him to agree with his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and not to break the Priviledges
thereof. To which purpoſe, they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49178:32"/>
preſented him with a Petition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching
him for poor <hi>Irelands</hi> ſake, to accord
with his Parliament, to allow them a Guard,
and do right to the accuſed Members; with
other things of that nature, expreſſed at large
in that Petition. The people about that time,
diſcontented with the Kings actions, and
thoſe obſtructions which they found in all
buſineſſes of Parliament, uſed to flock to
<hi>Weſtminſter</hi> in great throngs, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed,
by way of Petitioning, and many
times to utter rude ſpeeches againſt ſome
Lords, whom they conceived to be evil ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſers
of the King; which howſoever it were
meant, proved of ill conſequence to the
Common-wealth, and did not ſo much move
the King to be ſenſible of his grieving the
people, as arm him with an excuſe for leaving
the Parliament and City, for fear of what
might enſue upon ſuch tumultuous concourſe
of men.</p>
            <p>Upon this ground, twelve Biſhops at that
time abſenting themſelves, entred a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation
againſt all Laws, Votes, and Orders,
as Null, which in their abſence ſhould paſs;
by reaſon that they durſt not, for fear of their
lives, come to perform their duties in the
Houſe, having been rudely menaced, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted.
Whereupon it was agreed both by
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49178:33"/>
the Lords and Commons that this Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Biſhops was of dangerous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
and deeply entrenched upon the
Priviledge and Being of Parliaments. They
were therefore accuſed of high Treaſon, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended,
and committed priſoners to the
Tower.</p>
            <p>Thus was the Parliament daily troubled
with ill work, whereby the relief of <hi>Ireland</hi>
was hindered: but other particular hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
of <hi>Irelands</hi> relief then fell out, which
we ſhall expreſs briefly.</p>
            <p>When the Parliament were conſidering of
Forces to be ſent out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> being a
ſhort cut, many things happened to divert,
or delay it. There was a Bill for Preſſing of
Souldiers to that purpoſe depending in the
Houſe of Peers, which the King took ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
at, as to the putting of it into that
way; being, as he ſaid, a diminution of his
Prerogative: but becauſe he deſired <hi>Ireland</hi>
might be relieved, he was content that a
Bill ſhould paſs for that time with a <hi>Salvo
Jure</hi> both to King and people. This ſpeech
offended the Parliament; who declared in a
Petition, that the King by taking notice of
the debate in the Houſe of Lords concerning
the Bill for preſſing of Souldiers, had broken
the fundamental priviledge of Parliament,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49178:33"/>
which he ought not to do concerning any
Bill, till it be preſented to him in due courſe
of Parliament; for every Member hath free
liberty of ſpeech in propounding, or deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and the King ought not to be diſpleaſed
at him for ſuch opinions or propoſitions. For
this great breach of Priviledge they deſired
reparation, and that the King would make
known who they were by whoſe evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
he had done it, that they might receive
condign puniſhment.</p>
            <p>It was then alſo deſired, that an Army of
<hi>Scots</hi> ſhould be ſent into <hi>Ireland</hi> firſt; but the
Scotiſh Commiſſioners anſwered, That they
had no Commiſſion from their State to ſend
over a leſs number thither than 10000. The
Houſe of Commons conſented, out of Zeal
to the Cauſe; and Voted the ſending over of
ten thouſand <hi>Scots.</hi> But the Lords would
not yield unto it, unleſs the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
would give aſſurance that ten thouſand
Engliſh ſhould be ſent over as ſpeedily; which
was impoſſible to be done. And no other
reaſon given for this Oppoſition, but that it
was diſhonorable for <hi>England,</hi> that <hi>Ireland</hi>
ſhould be reduced by the <hi>Scots;</hi> and that the
<hi>Scots</hi> would make too great an advantage by
it. But this reaſon was not thought by ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
men, of weight enough to hinder ſo good
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49178:34"/>
a work; when the cauſe of Religion, and
the deplorable eſtate of ſo many thouſand
poor Chriſtians groaned for aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>A third Obſtruction of <hi>Irelands</hi> Relief was
thus: Two thouſand five hundred <hi>Scots</hi> were
in readineſs to be tranſported into the North
of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Concerning the condition of
their going, the Commiſſioners of <hi>Scotland</hi>
delivered to the Engliſh Parliament eight
Propoſitions: Both Houſes conſented to all
the Propoſitions, but the King excepted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
one of thoſe Propoſitions; which was
the third in order: <hi>That the Scots would have
the keeping of the Town and Caſtle of Carrick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fergus, with power to remain there, or enlarge
their Quarters at diſcretion; and if any Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
or Troops in that Province ſhould joyn
with them, that they receive Orders from the
chief Commanders of the Scotiſh Forces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Article the King ſaid that he doubted
might be to the damage of <hi>England;</hi> and
therefore would have the Parliament think
upon it again. Nevertheleſs if they would
have it ſo, he would confer with the Scotiſh
Commiſſioners about it.</p>
            <p>The Scots anſwered the King, That they
were ſorry that his Majeſty, being their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49178:34"/>
King, ſhould ſhew leſs truſt in them,
then their neighbor Nation had freely done;
and ſhould think that Article too much for
them, which both Houſes of Parliament were
pleaſed with. The King at laſt (though too
much time were loſt) was contented to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of that Article, as the Parliament had
done.</p>
            <p>But that way which the Parliament thought
moſt powerful to Reduce <hi>Ireland,</hi> was by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturing
for proportions of Land there to
be ſhared amongſt the Engliſh Adventurers,
according to thoſe ſums of money, which
they would disburſe or ſubſcribe: That ſo
whoſoever in perſon or purſe helped towards
the conqueſt of thoſe bloody Rebels, might
be recompenſed, if the Work were done.
Propoſitions were framed in Parliament to
that purpoſe. The King confirmed theſe
Propoſitions, though at firſt he laughed at
them, and was heard to ſay, <hi>That they were
like to him, who ſold the Bears skin before the
Bear was killed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At laſt an Act was made, enabling the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
with power to carry on that War un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
<hi>Ireland</hi> ſhould be declared wholly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued;
and that no Peace, or Ceſſation of
Arms ſhould be ever made with the Rebels,
unleſs both Houſes of Parliament conſented
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49178:35"/>
to it. The King then offered to go in perſon
over into <hi>Ireland.</hi> But the Parliament thought
it was not fit to hazard the Kings perſon in
ſuch an expedition.</p>
            <p>The King was then at <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſted
at the City, and pretending the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of his abſence to be fear of Tumults:
for beſides what was before ſpoken of the
numbers which flocked to Petition at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi>
the King was advertiſed, That the
day after he retired to <hi>Hampton</hi> (which was
about a week after his going to the Houſe of
Commons) divers Citizens, with Boats, and
Guns in them, brought the five Members to
<hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> with many promiſes not to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
the Parliament.</p>
            <p>From thence, upon the twentieth of <hi>Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi>
the King ſent a Meſſage to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
deſiring them, that ſeeing particular
grievances were ſo many, as that it would be
tedious to preſent them by themſelves, they
would digeſt them into one Body; that ſo a
clear Judgement might be made upon them;
<hi>And then they ſhould ſee how ready he would be
to equal or exceed the greateſt examples of moſt
indulgent Princes in their Acts of Grace and
Favor to the People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:49178:35"/>
The Parliament gave him thanks, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
ſpeedily to conſider of it; but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
the King, in the mean time, to give
them a ſure ground of ſecurity (while they
diſcharged their Truſt) by putting the
Tower, with other principal Forts, and the
whole <hi>Militia</hi> of the Kingdom, into ſuch
hands, as the Parliament might truſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
to him.</p>
            <p>The King refuſed to grant that Petition;
alleaging, that he would reſerve to himſelf
the diſpoſal of all thoſe places, as a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal,
and inſeparable Flower of his Crown;
nevertheleſs, he promiſed to entruſt none
but faithful Perſons in any of thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>Many reaſons were ſhewed on both ſides,
and many Petitions and Anſwers paſſed; they
ſtill preſſing for this Grant of the <hi>Militia,</hi> and
the King ſtill denying it.</p>
            <p>The King then reſiding at <hi>Hampton</hi> Court,
had found out a new way to weaken the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
in their number, by ſending for ſome,
who were his Servants, to leave their ſitting
in the Houſe to attend him. Eſpecially he
aimed at the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> his Lord <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain;</hi>
and the Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> Groom of
the <hi>Stool;</hi> both whom he ſent for: but they
choſe rather to obey his Parliament-Writ,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49178:36"/>
than his private Command; and continued
ſitting. For which he ſent a Meſſenger to
demand the <hi>Staffe</hi> of the one, and the
<hi>Key</hi> of the other, being the Enſigns of
their Offices; which they willingly reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>George Digby</hi> about that time
had written a Letter to the Queen from
<hi>Midleborough</hi> in <hi>Zealand</hi> (whither he had
fled from <hi>England,</hi> when the Lords in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
had ſent for him upon ſome Miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanors,
and if he appeared not in twenty
days, had proclaimed him Traytor) in which
he intimates, That if the King will declare
himſelf, and retire to a ſafe place, he ſhould
be able to wait upon him from thence, as
well as from any part of <hi>England,</hi> over and
above the ſervice which he might do for him
there in the mean time.</p>
            <p>This Letter was intercepted, and brought
to the Parliament; whereby they began to
underſtand that the King had ſome deſign in
hand againſt them; which they more plainly
afterwards diſcerned.</p>
            <p>The King and Queen, about the middle of
<hi>February,</hi> with their eldeſt Daughter <hi>Mary,</hi>
Princeſs of <hi>Orange,</hi> went to <hi>Canterbury:</hi>
From which place (while ſome of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of both Houſes went between <hi>London</hi>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:49178:36"/>
and that City upon divers buſineſſes) the
King ſigned the Bill for taking away Biſhops
Votes in Parliament.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Canterbury</hi> they went to <hi>Dover:</hi>
from whence the Queen paſſed into <hi>Holland,</hi>
under pretext of keeping her Daughter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
to her Husband: But ſhe carried with
her the Crown-Jewels of <hi>England,</hi> and
pawned them there; whereby ſhe bought
Arms for that War which enſued, and was it
ſeems then deſigned by the King againſt the
Parliament.</p>
            <p>After her departure, the King taking the
Prince and Duke of <hi>York</hi> with him, went to
<hi>Theobalds;</hi> there he received a Petition from
the Parliament on the firſt of <hi>March,</hi> one
thouſand ſix hundred forty one, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they deſired him to Grant the <hi>Militia,</hi> to
abide neer <hi>London,</hi> and not to carry the
Prince away.</p>
            <p>All which he denied; and went immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
to <hi>New-Market.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There he was preſented with a Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
drawn by both Houſes. The Earls of
<hi>Pembrook</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> with ſome Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
carried it; In which they repeat the
old Grievances; his wicked War againſt
<hi>Scotland,</hi> the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion raiſed here by
many preſumptions, his attempt of engaging
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:49178:37"/>
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army againſt the Parliament, his
entring the Houſe of Commons, with the
like; and that his fear to reſide neer <hi>London</hi>
is without ground, and pretended for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but to perplex the Common-wealth,
to hinder the relief of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
the ill-affected party in this Kingdom:
to which the King Anſwered with great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation,
and afterwards anſwered it by
a long Declaration of his own, endeavoring
to clear himſelf of ſome things, and exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate,
or excuſe others; accuſing them for
coining to themſelves needleſs Fears and
Jealouſies; and ſo theſe Commiſſioners de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from <hi>Theobalds</hi> (while the Parliament
ſuffered him, without any real hinderance)
to the Peoples great griefs, he paſſed to the
City of <hi>York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Parliament in the mean time ſit, and
Vote only againſt the Kings evil Counſel, and
make three Votes.</p>
            <p>1. That the Kings abſence, ſo far remote
from his Parliament, is not only an obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but may be a deſtruction to the Affairs in
<hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That when the Lord and Commons
in Parliament ſhall declare what the Law
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49178:37"/>
of the Land is, to have this not only que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned,
and controverted, but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted,
and a command that it ſhould not be
obeyed, is an high breach of the Priviledge of
Parliament.</p>
            <p>3. That they which adviſed the King to
abſent himſelf from the Parliament, are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
to the peace of this Kingdom, and
juſtly to be ſuſpected as favorers of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>York</hi> the King ſent a Meſſage to the
Parliament, on the eighth of <hi>April</hi> 1642.
that he would go in perſon over to <hi>Ireland</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thoſe bloody Rebels; and therefore
intended to raiſe by his Commiſſion neer
<hi>Weſtcheſter</hi> a Guard for his Perſon (when he
ſhould come into <hi>Ireland)</hi> of 2000 Foot,
and 200 Horſe, whom he would arm from his
Magazine at <hi>Hull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Parliament ſuſpecting, as well by
my Lord <hi>Digby</hi> his intercepted Letter, as by
other preſumptions, That the Kings chief end
of going Northward, was to ſeize the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine
of <hi>Hull,</hi> and arm himſelf from thence
againſt them; ſent a Petition to him, for
leave to remove that Magazine to the Tower
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:49178:38"/>
of <hi>London;</hi> and accordingly had ſent Sir
<hi>John Hotham</hi> thither, who prevented the
King, and kept out the Earl of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi>
whom the King had ſent thither alſo for the
ſame purpoſe; at which action of theirs, the
King was much moved.</p>
            <p>On the three and twentieth day of <hi>April</hi>
1642. the King, attended by ſome Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Gentlemen, and Souldiers, came at
the Wals of <hi>Hull,</hi> and demanded entrance;
but the Gates were ſhut, and Sir <hi>John Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham</hi>
appeared upon the Wall, and kneeling
there, entreated the King not to command
that, which he, without breach of Truſt,
could not obey: in concluſion, the King not
getting entrance, proclaimed <hi>Hotham</hi> Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;
and ſent a complaining Meſſage to the
Parliament concerning that affront.</p>
            <p>The Parliament labored to appeaſe him,
but juſtified <hi>Hothams</hi> act; and Declared,
That proclaiming Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> Traytor,
without due proceſs of Law, was againſt the
Liberty of the Subject, and Laws of the
Land.</p>
            <p>Upon this buſineſs of <hi>Hull,</hi> paſſed in <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
ſhort time many Declarations on both ſides,
with Arguments drawn from the Statutes
and Laws of <hi>England;</hi> and many commands
contrary to each other; the Parliament au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorizing
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:49178:38"/>
Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> to iſſue out War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
to the Conſtables and other Officers,
to come with Arms to the defence of <hi>Hull:</hi>
and the King on the other ſide forbiding any
ſuch Warrants, or Training, without autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
under his hand.</p>
            <p>The King, while the Parliament let him
alone in the North, daily Summoned the
Gentry of thoſe Counties to attend him at
<hi>York,</hi> and daily gained ſome to his party;
whoſe proceedings there in every particular,
are too tedious for this Relation; but his fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Orations to them were in ſubſtance,
That he was in danger of the Parliament,
and deſired a Guard for his perſon: and
when the King made Proclamation for all
Gentlemen and others, to attend him in
Arms as a Guard; the Parliament at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
only declared, That ſuch Arming of men
to the diſturbance of the Kingdoms peace,
was againſt the Laws and Liberties of the
Kingdoms: Thus did Proclamations and
Declarations for a long time encounter each
other.</p>
            <p>But nothing made the Kingdom fear a
War, until that great defection of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Members, who left their Seats, and
went to the King at <hi>York:</hi> Which happened
about the end of <hi>April,</hi> and continued a
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49178:39"/>
great part of <hi>May</hi> following; in which
ſpace a great number of the Lords, ſome ſent
for by the King, others for their own diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,
fears, or ambition, quitted their Seats
in Parliament, and went to him one after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
            <p>The Lords that left the Parliament were
theſe;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Duke of</hi> Richmond, <hi>Marqueſs</hi> Hartford,
<hi>the Earls of</hi> Lindſey, Cumberland, Hunting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
Bath, Southampton, Dorſet, Northampton,
Devonſhire, Briſtol, Weſtmerland, Barkshire,
Monmoth, Rivers, Newcaſtle, Dover, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narvan,
Newport; <hi>the Lords</hi> Matrevers,
Willoughby <hi>of</hi> Eresby, Rich, Howard <hi>of</hi>
Charleton, Newark, Paget, Chandois, Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conbridge,
Paulet, Lovelace, Savil, Coventry,
Mohun, Dunſmore, Seymour, Gray <hi>of</hi> Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
Capel.</p>
            <p>Within that time alſo many of the Houſe
of Commons did ſo far break their Truſt, as
to forſake their Seats in Parliament, and go
to the King.</p>
            <p>This Revolt of ſo many Members of both
Houſes, was generally looked upon, as a
thing of moſt ſad conſequence, and likely to
produce no effects, but lamentable and
wicked: as to nouriſh and encreaſe the
Kings diſ-affection to Parliaments; to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49178:39"/>
his diſtance from it, and attempts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it; to ſecure the Iriſh Rebels, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the dignity of that high Court, and make
the King, by this diminution of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
(as he did in his following Declarations)
call them a Faction, a pretended Parliament,
and ſuch like names.</p>
            <p>The Parliament continued ſtill Petitioning
the King; and on the twentieth of <hi>May</hi>
ſent to entreat him, that he would Disband
his Forces, and rely for his ſecurity (as his
Predeceſſors had done) upon the Laws, and
Affections of his people; contenting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with his ordinary Guards; declaring,
that elſe they held themſelves bound in duty
to God, and the truſt repoſed in them by
the people, and by the fundamental Laws,
to employ their utmoſt care, and power, for
ſecuring the Parliament, and preſerving the
Kingdoms Peace.</p>
            <p>Upon which, theſe Votes were made in
Parliament.</p>
            <p>That it appears that the King ſeduced by
wicked Councel, intends to make a War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Parliament, who in all their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations
and actions have propoſed no other
end to themſelves, but the care of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49178:40"/>
and the performance of all duty and
loyaltie to his perſon.</p>
            <p>It was likewiſe Reſolved upon the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
That,</p>
            <p>Whenſoever the King maketh War upon
the Parliament, it is a breach of the Truſt
repoſed in him by his people, contrary to his
Oath, and tending to the diſſolution of this
Government.</p>
            <p>As alſo,</p>
            <p>That whoſoever ſhall ſerve or aſsiſt him
in ſuch Wars, are Traitors by the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Laws of this Kingdom, and have
been ſo adjudged in two Acts of Parliament,
<hi>II Richard</hi> 2, and 1 <hi>Henry</hi> 4, and that
ſuch Perſons ought to ſuffer as Traitors.</p>
            <p>But thoſe Lords who had forſaken the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
continued ſtill with the King in the
North; wherefore the Parliament by an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the thirtieth of <hi>May,</hi> Summoned
nine of them, who firſt had gone away, to
appear at <hi>Weſtminſter; viz.</hi> The Earls of
<hi>Northampton, Devonſhire, Dover,</hi> and <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth;</hi>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:49178:40"/>
the Lords <hi>Howard</hi> of <hi>Charleton, Rich,
Grey</hi> of <hi>Ruthen, Coven<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ry,</hi> and <hi>Capel.</hi> But
they refuſed to come away, returning an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
in writing; which the Parliament judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be a ſlighting, and ſcornful Letter; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which, a Vote was paſſed againſt them in
the Houſe of Commons, and preſented on
the 15 of <hi>June</hi> to the Lords by Maſter <hi>Hollis,</hi>
with an Oration concerning the importance
of the buſineſs.</p>
            <p>Upon the impeachment of the nine Lords,
the Houſe of Peers about a month after, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in their Robes, entred into debate of the
ſaid impeachment; and after divers Speeches
made, ſetting forth the greatneſs of their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
they were Cenſured,
<list>
                  <item>1 Never to ſit more as Members of that
Houſe.</item>
                  <item>2 To be incapable of the Benefit or Priviledge
of Parliament.</item>
                  <item>3 To ſuffer impriſonment during their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>After which Cenſure, it was concluded,
That the ſaid Lords ſhould be demanded in
the behalf of both Houſes of Parliament, to
ſubmit to the ſaid Cenſure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:49178:41"/>
After this, another wound was given to
the Parliament, encouraging the King in his
Deſigns; the Great Seal of <hi>England</hi> was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away from the Parliament at <hi>London,</hi> to
the King at <hi>York,</hi> by the Lord Keeper <hi>Little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
a man that had continued ſome time, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the reſt were gone, firm in appearance,
Voted with them, and gave his Voice for
ſetling of the <hi>Militia</hi> by Ordinance of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
            <p>But about the end of <hi>June,</hi> one Maſter
<hi>Eliot</hi> a Courtier, was ſent cloſely from <hi>York</hi>
to him; who having gotten privacy with the
Lord Keeper, ſo far prevailed at laſt, that he
got the Great Seal into his hands, and rid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with it to the King at <hi>York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord Keeper <hi>Littleton,</hi> after ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
thoughts with himſelf, not being able
to anſwer it to the Parliament, rode away
himſelf next day to the King alſo. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
which he gave to ſome friends of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
for ſo parting with the Seal, was
this, The King when he made him Lord
Keeper, gave him an Oath in private, which
he took, That whenſoever the King ſhould
ſend to him for the Great Seal, he ſhould
forthwith deliver it. This Oath, he ſaid, he
could not diſpence with in Conſcience, but
was ſorry he had taken the Office with ſuch
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49178:41"/>
an Oath. The Seal was given him ſince this
Parliament ſate; which made it appear what
intentions the King even then had to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
            <p>The King having now gotten the Great
Seal, iſſued forth many Proclamations; and
among other, one, That no man ſhould o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
the Parliaments Warrants about ſetling
the <hi>Militia:</hi> and they on the other ſide by
Ordinances forbad any man to raiſe Arms by
Warrant from the King, without the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Parliament.</p>
            <p>The Parliament being then intent upon
ſetling the <hi>Militia</hi> by Land, they took care
alſo to ſeize the Navy into their hands, for
ſecurity of the Kingdom againſt forreign in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions.</p>
            <p>To that purpoſe, the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> a
Nobleman of good experience in Sea-affairs,
and undoubted fidelity to his Countrey, was
by an Ordinance of both Houſes choſen to
be Lord Admiral. But the King had choſen
Sir <hi>John Penington</hi> to that place, in the room
of the Earl of <hi>Northumberland;</hi> and ſent a
Command to the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> to reſign
the place to him.</p>
            <p>But the Earl-choſe rather to obey the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of Parliament, and with great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and policy got the Fleet into his hands,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49178:42"/>
though many of the Captains ſtood out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, alleaging they had the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
to obey Sir <hi>John Penington;</hi> but the
Earl deprived them of their Commands, and
poſſeſſed himſelf of the Ships; taking ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after another Ship called the <hi>Lion,</hi> of
great import, coming out of <hi>Holland,</hi> and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
with Gunpowder; which proved a great
addition to his ſtrength.</p>
            <p>All men at this time began to deſpair of the
Kings return to his Parliament, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
on the 10 of <hi>June</hi> was an Order made
in Parliament for bringing in money and
plate, to raiſe Arms for the Cauſe; the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Faith for repayment to them that
brought it in, was engaged by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and intereſt of eight in the hundred.
Which was accordingly brought in in great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
by well-affected people: as alſo
Horſes and Arms for that ſervice.</p>
            <p>The King at that time had received Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and Arms, with Ammunition out of
<hi>Holland,</hi> upon the pawning of the Crown-Jewels
which the Queen had carried over in
<hi>February</hi> before. He then ſent out his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions
of Array to Arm the people, into all
Counties: wherein he uſed the Parliaments
own words, as in a Jeer of them. For the
Parliament profeſſed that their receiving of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49178:42"/>
plate and money, and levying of Forces was,
<hi>To maintain the Proteſtant Religion, the
Kings Perſon, dignity, and authority, the
Laws of the Land, the peace of the Kingdom,
and priviledge of Parliament. The Kings
words were the ſame; namely, To maintain
the Proteſtant Religion, his own perſon and
authority, the Laws, Kingdoms Peace, and
priviledge of Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas the Parliament in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations,
both then, and afterward, uſed to
ſay, That they did arm againſt a malignant
party, by whom the Kings perſon was in
danger; he in his, ſaid the like, and that for
the ſafety of his own perſon and people,
there was an inevitable neceſſity of putting
the Kingdom into a poſture of defence; u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
thoſe very words in his Commiſſion of
Array, which they did in their Ordinance for
the <hi>Militia.</hi> And invited people to bring
plate and money to him, in that language
which the Parliament did: nor did it prove
leſs effectual; for many Lords, Gentlemen,
and others very freely brought in Money and
plate, to ſerve the King, within a ſhort
ſpace.</p>
            <p>In all this heat of preparations, the King,
before thoſe Lords that were with him in the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49178:43"/>
North, made a ſolemn Proteſtation, as before
God, that he would not engage them in any
War againſt the Parliament, but only for his
neceſſary defence; that his deſire was to
maintain the Proteſtant Religion, the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Subject, and priviledge of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Upon which, thoſe Lords made a ſolemn
Proteſtation, as before God, and ſubſcribed
their Names to it, That they did believe the
Kings intention to be as he ſaid; namely,
That he had no purpoſe to Levy War againſt
the Parliament; and that he endeavored on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to maintain the Proteſtant Religion, the
Laws, Liberties of the Subject, and juſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
of Parliament.</p>
            <p>The King immediately after this took a
progreſs about the Countries adjacent, and
at divers places made ſpeeches to the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and inhabitants, full of gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
and declaring his intentions to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the peoples Liberties, and priviledge
of Parliament; after which he returned to
<hi>York:</hi> and having raiſed an Army of three
thouſand Foot, and one thouſand Horſe, went
to <hi>Beverly,</hi> with an intention to beſiege <hi>Hull;</hi>
making Proclamation beforehand, That no
man ſhould preſume to aſſiſt <hi>Hull,</hi> againſt him,
or bring any force thither. The Parliament,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:49178:43"/>
on the other ſide publiſhed a Declaration, for
the preſervation and ſafety of the Kingdom,
and of the town of <hi>Hull,</hi> with aſſurance of
ſatisfaction to all thoſe who ſuſtained any
loſs by their ſervice for the ſafety of that
Town, or by overflowing of water upon
the grounds there.</p>
            <p>The King was within two hours march of
<hi>Hull,</hi> when Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> calling a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
of War, by whom it was thought ſo fit,
drowned the Countrey about <hi>Hull,</hi> drawing
up the Sluce; giving the Owners time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
their Cattel and Goods, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
being to ſatisfie their damages upon the
publick Faith.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>John Meldrum,</hi> an old Souldier, was
aſſiſtant to <hi>Hotham;</hi> who ſallying bravely
out of the Town with five hundred Townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
made the Kings party retreat to <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verly,</hi>
ſome being ſlain, and taken in the
Chaſe.</p>
            <p>Within a ſhort time after, (when five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
men ſent from <hi>London</hi> arrived at <hi>Hull)</hi>
Sir <hi>John Meldrum</hi> made a fiercer Sally, and
forced moſt of the Leaguer to retire diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
one and twenty of them being ſlain, and
fifteen taken priſoners; and following his
good ſucceſs, came to <hi>Aulby,</hi> where the Kings
Magazine of Arms, Ammunition, and Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balls
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49178:44"/>
were kept in a Barn; all which he
took, and fired the Barn: Upon which, the
King calling a Councel of War, upon their
advice broke up the ſiege before <hi>Hull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the twelfth of <hi>July</hi> the Parliament
Voted that an Army ſhould be raiſed for the
ſafety of the Kings perſon, and defence
of the Parliament. Of which the Earl of
<hi>Eſſex,</hi> a man of eminent fidelity and worth,
was by an unanimous conſent of both Houſes
choſen General.</p>
            <p>Some Lords and Members of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
were ſent down into the Counties to
ſettle the <hi>Militia,</hi> and raiſe Forces for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of ſeveral Towns and places.</p>
            <p>And divers Members of the Houſes Liſted
themſelves in the Lord General <hi>Eſſex</hi> his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
and took Commiſſions from him, as Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels.</p>
            <p>But immediately after this time, the Kings
Commiſſions of Array were ſent down into
every County (though often declared by the
Parliament to be illegal) and were obeyed
in many places, more than the Parliaments
Ordinances for the <hi>Militia;</hi> by reaſon that
ſo many Lords and Gentlemen adhered to
him now againſt the Parliament.</p>
            <p>But there were ſcarce any Counties free
from contention, betwixt the Commiſſioners
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49178:44"/>
of the one, and the Ordinances of the other;
which ſtrugled together, with great Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and Gentry on both ſides: Neither had
the Kings Proclamations, nor the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
Ordinances obedience from all,
only as far as the now-drawing ſwords enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
it.</p>
            <p>During theſe Diviſions in ſeveral Counties,
<hi>London</hi> it ſelf was not free: for the Lord Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
of <hi>London,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Gurney,</hi> was by the
Parliament committed priſoner to the Tower
of <hi>London,</hi> for moving ſedition in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
by cauſing the Kings Commiſſion of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray
(a thing declared illegal by both Houſes)
to be proclaimed in the City: and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
an additional impeachment was
brought in againſt him by the Common-Councel
of <hi>London,</hi> for divers breaches of
his Oath in that Office, and contemning the
Orders of Parliament.</p>
            <p>After many days attendance concerning
theſe Accuſations, on the twelfth day of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi>
he received his Cenſure at the Houſe of
Lords; which was,</p>
            <p>That he ſhould be turned out of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joralty.</p>
            <p>That he ſhould never bear any Office in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>That he ſhould be incapable of any Honor or,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:49178:45"/>
Dignity to be conferred on him by the King; and
Committed Priſoner to the Tower during the
pleaſure of both Houſes.</p>
            <p>Many Proclamations about that time paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
from the King, and Declarations from the
Parliament; one from the King againſt the
Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> as a Rebel, and all that adhered
unto him; and a Declaration from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
recounting all that the Kings evil
counſel (for ſo they call it) had done illegal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
againſt them: the Parliament likewiſe pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
what in particular had been done by
his party againſt <hi>Ireland;</hi> and how that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Kingdome had been of late robbed of
many Reliefes, of Cloathes, Victuals, and
Arms which the Parliament had ſent them,
by the King and his party.</p>
            <p>While theſe writings on both ſides laſted,
the King removed often to gather ſtrength,
and in ſeveral places made Speeches to the
Countries, with many Proteſtations of his
affection to the people. At laſt he came to
<hi>Nottingham,</hi> where, about the middle of
<hi>Auguſt,</hi> he ſet up his Standard-Royal. Very
few People came to it, nor had the King at
that time any conſiderable ſtrength; nor if
the Parliament would then have ſeized upon
his perſon, could he have kept himſelf out of
their hands.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:49178:45"/>
From <hi>Notingham</hi> on the twenty fifth of
that Month he ſent a Meſſage to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
by the Earls of <hi>Southampton</hi> and <hi>Dorſet,</hi>
and Sir <hi>John Culpeper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In that Meſſage he ſignifieth a deſire to
compoſe the difference by a Treaty; that a
certain number of Perſons ſent, and enabled
by the Parliament, may treat in ſome indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
place, with the like number authorized
by him.</p>
            <p>The Parliament anſwer, That until he
put them in a condition to treat, that is,
until he take down his Standard, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
thoſe Proclamations, wherein he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
(a thing unheard of before) both
Houſes of Parliament Traytors and Rebels,
they cannot, by the Fundamental Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
of Parliament, or by the publick
truſt repoſed in them, or with the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
good of the Realm, admit of any ſuch
Treaty.</p>
            <p>The KING denied that he advanced his
Standard againſt the Parliament, or that
he called them Rebels: but within few
dayes, in his Inſtructions to his Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
of Array, Marqueſs <hi>Harford,</hi> the Earl
of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Strange,</hi> he
again called the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> Rebel and
Traytor.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:49178:46"/>
Thus did they contend for ſome time, by
Declarations and Proclamations; which
proved all fruitleſs, as to ſatisfying of the
people; nor could this lamentable War
be averted.</p>
            <p>Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> and Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> the
the ſecond and third Sons of the late King
of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> were now come into <hi>England</hi>
the beginning of <hi>September,</hi> to offer their
ſervice to the King, their Uncle; whom
preſently he put into Commands. Prince
<hi>Rupert,</hi> the Elder and Fiercer by nature,
Commanding a Body of Horſe, flew with
great fury through divers Counties, raiſing
men for the King's ſervice in a rigorous way,
Committing outrages to thoſe who favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Parliament; upon which, the Houſes
fell into a debate, agreeing, that a Charge
of Treaſon ſhould be drawn up againſt him,
for endeavouring the Deſtruction of this
State, and abuſing that Court which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
it.</p>
            <p>The King marched another way; and
paſſing through <hi>Derbyſhire, Leicesterſhire,</hi>
and <hi>Nottinghamſhire,</hi> he commanded the
Trained Bands of thoſe Counties to attend
and Guard his Perſon; and when they
were met, he diſarmed the greateſt part of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49178:46"/>
them, taking as many Arms as ſerved for
two thouſand men, beſides good ſumms of
Money, which he borrowed by conſtraint;
proteſting ſtill (as uſually he did) to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Proteſtant Religion, the Laws and
Liberties of the Subject, and the priviledges
of Parliament.</p>
            <p>The Parliament-Army, raiſed under the
Conduct of the General <hi>Eſſex,</hi> was now
grown into a conſiderable Bulk; conſiſting
of about fourteen thouſand Horſe and Foot;
their general <hi>Rendezvouz</hi> was at <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
where many of the chief Commanders
ſtayed with them, expecting the preſence of
the General himſelf. The Lord General
<hi>Eſſex,</hi> on the ninth of <hi>September,</hi> taking his
leave of the Parliament and City of <hi>London,</hi>
went towards <hi>Northampton,</hi> and was waited
on by the trained Bands, and a great number
of armed Gentlemen from <hi>Eſſex</hi>-houſe to the
end of the City, with great ſolemnity. The
Parliament ſent a Petition to the General at
<hi>Northampton,</hi> to be by him preſented to the
King in a ſafe and honourable way; the
effect of which was, humbly to entreat his
Majeſty to withdraw his preſence from thoſe
wicked perſons about him, and not to mix his
danger with theirs; but that he would return
to his Parliament; and ſuch-like things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:49178:47"/>
The King intending to ſeize upon <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi>
ſent Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> thither with ſome
Horſe; which <hi>Eſſex</hi> fearing, to prevent the
King, commanded part of his forces to march
thither ſpeedily, himſelf following with his
Army.</p>
            <p>Some Skirmiſhes happened between that
party of Parliamentarians and Prince <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert,</hi>
before the coming of General <hi>Eſſex;</hi> but
Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> when the forerunners of <hi>Eſſex</hi>
his Army were in ſight, with great ſpeed fled
out of <hi>Worcester.</hi> General <hi>Eſſex,</hi> leaving a
Gariſon at <hi>Northampton,</hi> marched to <hi>Coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;</hi>
which Town he alſo gariſoned, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<hi>Warwick,</hi> and marched from thence with
his main Army to <hi>Worceſter;</hi> where he made
ſome ſtay.</p>
            <p>The King at that time with a ſmall Body
of Horſe went to <hi>Shrewsbury;</hi> to which
place he cauſed a Mint to be brought; and
Coined his Plate: for many Gentlemen about
that time, had, beſides Money and Arms,
brought Plate in unto him. At <hi>Shrewsbury</hi>
he grew wonderful in ſtrength; ſo that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
three weeks after his coming thither, from
a ſmall inconſiderable Body of Horſe, he was
grown into an Army conſiſting of about ſix
thouſand Foot, and three thouſand Horſe,
and two thouſand Dragoneirs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:49178:47"/>
From <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> the King marched along
by <hi>Coventry,</hi> and came to <hi>Southam;</hi> being but
a ſmall diſtance from the Lord General <hi>Eſſex</hi>
his Army: from whence he ſtruck a terror
(though ſo far off) into the City of <hi>London</hi> it
ſelf; for he was then neerer to <hi>London</hi> by a
dayes march, then the General was; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as that <hi>London</hi> made great proviſions to
Guard it ſelf, and the Parliament ſent twelve
Companies to poſſeſs and Guard <hi>Windſor</hi>-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle.</p>
            <p>The General thought it his chief work to
follow the King's Army, for fear he ſhould
march toward <hi>London;</hi> and by reaſon of that
haſte, left behinde him a great part of his
Forces, and great Artillery.</p>
            <p>The King perceiving that, and loath to
loſe ſo good an advantage of fighting (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Parliament-Forces were conjoyned)
turned back againſt General <hi>Eſſex;</hi> who was
alſo reſolved to give battel.</p>
            <p>A fair Champion Ground there is neer
<hi>Keynton,</hi> a Village in <hi>Warwickshire;</hi> and
not above twenty furlongs from that Village,
a great and ſteep hill, upon which the King's
Army had ſpread themſelves; and at the foot
of that Hill, a large Plain, called <hi>The Vale of
the Red-Horſe:</hi> here firſt the battel joyned;
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49178:48"/>
the Royaliſts deſcending cheerfully down the
hill, and the Parliamentarians from <hi>Keynton</hi>
approaching toward them. The fight was
begun with great courage, and much ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
on both parts: on one ſide the Earl of
<hi>Lindſey;</hi> on the other, the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
diſcharging the parts both of Generals
and Souldiers.</p>
            <p>But preſently after the Battel was begun,
Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> who commanded the Horſe in
the King's right Wing, fell in with ſo furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
a Charge upon the Parliaments left
Wing, (where moſt of their Horſe were
placed) that immediately he put to flight all
thoſe Parliament-Horſe, whoſe Foot like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
being left by the Horſe, betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to flight. Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> following the
chaſe far, and greedy of pillage, whileſt he
was buſie in ſeizing the Carriages and Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
of his Enemies, ſpent ſo much time
therein, that the King's Victory (which
was almoſt gotten) was by that means quite
loſt: for in the King's left Wing the fortune
was nor equal, whom Sir <hi>William Balfore</hi>
charged ſo roundly, that he broke the beſt
Foot-Regiments, and ſeized upon the King's
Artillery.</p>
            <p>There was a bloody fight: in that place the
Kings Standard was taken, but ſoon loſt again:
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:49178:48"/>
there were ſlain and taken Priſoners many
brave men, among whom <hi>Lindſey</hi> the King's
General was taken Priſoner, who died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
few hours, of his wounds.</p>
            <p>Night parted the fight, and gave a ſafe
retreat to both ſides: both ſides challenged
the Victory to themſelves; for which,
thanks were publickly given to God both by
the Parliament and the King; for on both
ſides appeared ſome marks of Victory, as En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,
Canons, and Priſoners taken. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the number of the ſlain was no agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
both partyes reporting too falſly: but
it was thought that of both Armies (though
more of the King's ſide then the other) were
ſlain in that battel above five thouſand.</p>
            <p>General <hi>Eſſex</hi> marched to <hi>Coventry,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh
his Army: the King to <hi>Oxford,</hi> as to
his Winter-Quarters. Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> with
a Body of Horſe flew up and down the
Countrey Night and Day, plundering and
robbing Towns and Villages; and made
his Excurſions ſo far out of <hi>Oxford,</hi> that he
ſtruck a terrour into the City of <hi>London</hi> it
ſelf, inſomuch, as that they deſired Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<hi>Eſſex</hi> (who had deſigned to follow the
King) that he would bring his Army neerer
to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eſſex</hi> on the ſeventh Day of <hi>November,</hi>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:49178:49"/>
came to <hi>Westminster,</hi> (quartering his Forces in
the adjacent Villages) and was received with
great Honour by both Houſes of Parliament,
and was preſented with five thouſand pounds
as a gratuity, with a large acknowledgement
of his valour and pains undergone for the
Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>Before the General departed from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
another bloody Battel was fought
about <hi>Brainford.</hi> And ſo happened the
occaſion; the Parliament grieved for this
unnatural War, deſirous to ſave the Kingdom,
and recover <hi>Ireland,</hi> had agreed upon a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for Accommodation to be preſented to
the King, being then at <hi>Colebrook,</hi> by the
Earls of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Pembrook,</hi> the
Lord <hi>Wainman,</hi> Maſter <hi>Perpoint,</hi> and Sir <hi>John
Ipſley.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King gave a fair Anſwer, proteſting
before God, That he was grieved for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
ſufferings; and in order to peace, was
willing to reſide neer <hi>London,</hi> and receive ſuch
Propoſitions as they would ſend, and treat
with them.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the Commiſſioners were
gone with this Anſwer, the King's Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery
(for ſo all Relations agree) advanced
forward with the Horſe, thorow <hi>Colebrook,</hi>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:49178:49"/>
after them toward <hi>London;</hi> and taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of a great Miſt, which happened that
Night, they marched to <hi>Brainford,</hi> and fell
upon the Parliaments Forces that were quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
there, which was a broken Regiment of
Colonel <hi>Hollis</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>The King's Army killed many of them,
and had, in likelihood, utterly deſtroyed
them all, if the Lord <hi>Brook</hi>'s and Colonel
<hi>Hamden</hi>'s Regiments, that were billeted
not far off, had not come in to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief;
who maintained a great and bloody
fight againſt the King's Army, till both
ſides at Night retreated: many were
ſlain and taken Priſoners on both ſides,
and both reported themſelves Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
as before it happened at <hi>Keynton</hi>
Battel.</p>
            <p>News of this unexpected Fight was ſoon
at <hi>London,</hi> where the General was ſitting in
Parliament, whither alſo the noiſe of their
great Artillery was eaſily heard: he took
Horſe immediately, to get ſtrength together,
and relieve his engaged men; but Night had
parted them, and the King was retired to his
beſt advantages.</p>
            <p>All that Night, Forces came out of <hi>London</hi>
thither, ſo that on the Sunday Morning,
being the fourteenth of <hi>November,</hi> a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:49178:50"/>
number of armed men were met, and
had ſo far encompaſt the King's Army, (ſmall
in compariſon of them) that many hoped for
an end of the War: but God was nor ſo
pleaſed; for the King eſcaped by reaſon of
this error: Three thouſand Parliament Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
were then at <hi>Kingston;</hi> they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to leave that Town, and march
ſpeedily thorow <hi>Surrey,</hi> and over <hi>London</hi>-Bridge,
ſo thorow the City, to <hi>Brainford,</hi>
to ſtop the Enemies paſſage to <hi>London.</hi> A
reaſon of that Command was afterwards
given, becauſe the Lord General was not
aſſured of ſtrength enough to ſtop the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
from going to <hi>London;</hi> nor could he be
beforehand ſure of ſo great a Force, as he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
perceived to be come to him before
morning.</p>
            <p>Thus did the encloſed King eſcape, and
retreated thorow that Town of <hi>Kingston,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo abandon'd by the Parliaments ſouldiers;
and after he had plundered the country there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts,
retired ſafely to his Winter-Quarters
at <hi>Oxford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Parliament conſidering this action of
the King, began to hope little upon any
Treaty; reſolving, That the General ſhould
ſpeedily purſue the King's Forces, and fall
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:49178:50"/>
upon them: and the City of</hi> London, <hi>to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
the Parliament, made a Petition to
them; wherein they entreated,</hi> That they would
proceed no further in the buſineſs of Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
becauſe evil counſel was ſo prevalent with
the King, that he would but delude them; that
they had heard his Forces are weak; and entreat,
that his Excellency would follow, and fall upon
them; the City, as heretofore, being ready to ſpend
with all willingneſs their lives and fortunes to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
the Parliament.</p>
            <p>For which Petition and Proteſtation, the
Parliament returned thanks to the City; and
according as they deſired, it was decreed in
Parliament.</p>

together with the Series of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
from whence it ſprung, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
the degrees by which it
grew, have been already breifly
and clearly ſhewed; The things which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
to be unfolded are of ſo great a weight,
of ſo various a nature, and of ſo many peices,
that ſcarce any Hiſtorian (I might ſay Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
it ſelf) is ſufficient to weave fully toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſo many particulars: my intention there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is to make onely a ſhort mention, not a
full Narration, of that Variety.</p>
            <p>For the War went on with horrid rage in
many places at one time; and the fire once
kindled, caſt forth through every corner of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49178:52"/>
the land not onely ſparks but devouring
flames; inſomuch as the kingdom of <hi>England</hi>
was divided into more Wars than Counties;
nor had ſhe more fields than skirmiſhes, nor
Cities than Sieges; and almoſt all the Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Lords, and great Houſes were turned
every where into Garriſons of War: they
fought at once by Sea and Land; and through
all <hi>England</hi> (who could but lament the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries
of his Country) ſad ſpectacles were of
plundering and firing Villages; and the
fields; otherwiſe waſt and deſolate, were
rich onely and terribly glorious in Camps
and Armies.</p>
            <p>The following Summer, namely in the year
one thouſand ſix hundred forty three proved
for a long time fatal to the Parliament, and
Fortune ſeemed to have condemned the
cauſe of liberty; ſo exceedingly did the Kings
party flouriſh in ſucceſſes and Victories, and
the Parliaments condition every where low
ſo that they were neer to ruine, who in the
end prevailed.</p>
            <p>In the Weſt Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-chieftain,
who had gotten divers Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories,
and then almoſt quite vanquiſhed Sir
<hi>Ralph Hopton,</hi> was at laſt (namely in <hi>July)</hi> ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
defeated by the Lord <hi>Wilmot,</hi> who came
from <hi>Oxford</hi> with an Army of the Kings
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:49178:52"/>
and having loſt all his Army, returned to
<hi>London:</hi> and ſuch as the fortune of the Field
was, was the condition of Towns and Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;
for immediately after <hi>Wallers</hi> defeat,
the two greateſt Cities of all the Weſt were
yeilded up, <hi>Briſtol</hi> to Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter</hi>
to Prince <hi>Maurice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the ſame time, in the North of <hi>England,</hi>
was the like ſucceſs; where the Lord <hi>Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax,</hi>
who, with his valiant Son, had long and
proſperouſly maintained the cauſe of the
Parliament, being now over-powred by a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſant
Enemy, the Earl of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all his Forces ſcattered, was driven into
<hi>Hull,</hi> and there beſieged.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eſſex</hi> himſelf the great General at the
ſame time, his Army decreaſing ſuddainly,
ſome dying of ſickneſs, others for want forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
their colours, was conſtrained to leave
the field, and return to <hi>London,</hi> quartering the
ſick and weak remnant of his Army at <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,</hi>
and other adjacent places, until a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit
could be made for him.</p>
            <p>The Parliamentarians were now in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate
condition, and their ſtrengths every
where broken; on the other ſide the Roya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts
ſtrong and dreadful in Arms, Men, and
Horſes, conquerours of all the <hi>Weſt,</hi> of <hi>Wales,</hi>
and the North of <hi>England,</hi> as far as the very
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:49178:53"/>
borders of <hi>Scotland.</hi> One onely Town of
Note in the Midland Country, <hi>Gloceſter,</hi>
ſtood out yet, faithful and conſtant to the
Parliament, and much deſired by the King;
who in great diſdain that this Town (after
<hi>Briſtol</hi> and <hi>Exceſter</hi> were yeilded) ſhould
ſtand out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> came in perſon to beſiedge it with
a great Army.</p>
            <p>The Queen was now arrived in <hi>England,</hi>
and had brought with her great ſtore of
Armes, bought in <hi>Holland</hi> with the money
which ſhe had raiſed by pawning the
Crown-Jewels there; whoſe coming at
this time ſeemed rather to a Triumph than a
War.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gloceſter</hi> not onely ſtaid the career of the
Kings Victories; but made a great change
in the Conditions of the ſides. The City
was gallantly defended againſt a great and
flouriſhing Army; wherein <hi>Maſſey</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
juſtly gained a wonderful renown;
ſo long did he defend the City, until General
<hi>Eſſex</hi> could be recruited with an Army great
enough to raiſe the Siege, and march thither,
from <hi>London,</hi> eighty miles.</p>
            <p>Famous and honourable, in the judement
of all men, was that expedition of General
<hi>Eſſex,</hi> who by ſolong a March, fighting often
with great bodies of the Kings Horſe by the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:49178:53"/>
way, brought notwithſtanding his whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
ſafe to <hi>Glocester,</hi> raiſed the Siege, relieved
that Town, and in his retreat from thence en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered,
and vanquiſhed the Kings Army
in that memorable Battel of <hi>Newberry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this time the parliament revived; of
whoſe condition Wiſe men might juſtly have
doubted, if the King, leaving <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> had
marched directly with his Victorious Army
to <hi>London;</hi> which was then not at all fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and miſerably diſtracted with factions
within it. Or beſides, if the Earl of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi>
letting alone the beſieg<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng of <hi>Hull</hi> (which
likewiſe proved fruitleſs) had powred out his
numerous forces upon the Eaſtern aſſociated
Counties: but it otherwiſe pleaſed God, who
is the onely Lord of Hoaſts, and by whoſe
providence all things are guided.</p>
            <p>Both ſides now, by this Victory of <hi>Eſſex,</hi>
ſeemed to be put into an equal ballance both
of ſtrength and reputation; and this ſad War
not onely likely to be continued, but extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to a greater latitude: on one ſide the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
inviting to their aſſiſtance their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
of <hi>Scotland:</hi> on the other ſide the King
calling in his Iriſh. The Scots by a <hi>Covenant</hi>
to be taken by both Nations for conſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Religion, Laws and Liberties: the Iriſh
by a ceſſation of Armes granted by the King
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:49178:54"/>
(a peace being alſo promiſed) were drawn
in.</p>
            <p>The Scots promiſed to the Parliament
(from whom Commiſſioners were ſent to
<hi>Edinburgh</hi> about that buſineſs) that they
would bring into <hi>England</hi> to their aſſiſtance
an Army conſiſting of one and twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Horſe and Foot: the Parliament enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
themſelves to pay the Scots one hundred
thouſand pounds toward the charge of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
that Army.</p>
            <p>But the King dealt not ſo openly with
thoſe bloudy Iriſh, in bargaining for their
aſſiſtance, but by a pretence of ceſſation of
Arms for the behoof of the Engliſh Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
in that Kingdom; which ceſſation not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
was for the benefit of the Iriſh
Rebels; in lieu of which favour, they gave the
King thirty thouſand pounds.</p>
            <p>This was that ceſſation of Arms ſo much
ſpoken againſt by honeſt men in <hi>London<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> for
that reaſon eſpecially, that it was directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
a Law, and the Kings faith: for it was
enacted by authority of Parliament (the
King alſo ſigning the Act) in the year one
thouſand ſix hundred forty one, <hi>That the
War againſt thoſe bloudy Iriſh Rebels ſhould
proceed, untill it were declared by Parliament,
that Ireland were fully ſubdued, and that no
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:49178:54"/>
peace, nor any ceſſation of Arms ſhould be made
with thoſe Rebels, without the conſent of both
Houſes of Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus was aſſiſtance brought to either ſide;
to the King (which he eſpecially aimed at in
this buſineſs) that Engliſh Army, which for
almoſt a whole years ſpace had fought vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly
and victoriouſly againſt thoſe Rebels,
was now brought into <hi>England</hi> (within five
moneths after that ceſſation) to fight againſt
the Parliament of <hi>England:</hi> but the cauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
changed, the fortune of thoſe Souldiers
was likewiſe changed, for they had no ſucceſs
in <hi>England,</hi> but within a ſhort time after their
arrival, that whole Army was utterly defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and all their cheif commanders, with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen
hundred common Souldiers, were
taken priſoners by Sir <hi>Thomas Fa<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rfax.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Scottiſh Army, that Winter follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
about the middle of <hi>January,</hi> paſſing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Tweed</hi> came into <hi>England.</hi> The Earl of
<hi>Leven</hi> was General; his kinſman <hi>David Leſley</hi>
commanded the Horſe: the ſnow that fell at
that time covered the ground in an unuſual
depth, and as great a froſt had congealed all
the rivers; but the heat of fighting was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than the rigor of the air; and the patience
of Souldiers overcame the hard weather:
The Earl of <hi>Leven</hi> marched with his forces
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:49178:55"/>
againſt the Earl of <hi>Newcaſtle;</hi> who with a
great Army poſſeſſed the Northern parts of
<hi>England</hi> for the King; nor did the War goe
on with leſs vigour in other parts. In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Spring great Armies were
raiſed on both ſides, and filled all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
with terrour: all the following Summer,
which fell in the year one thouſand ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
forty four, they fought with equal fury,
and almoſt equal fortunes; inſomuch as that
<hi>England</hi> by the dubiouſneſs of ſucceſs on
both ſides, and ſad viciſſitude of calamitous
ſlaughters, was made an unhappy Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The Kings fortune was ſuſteined by brave
Armies in the Weſt, under the Princes, <hi>Rupert</hi>
and <hi>Maurice;</hi> in <hi>Wales</hi> under <hi>Gerard,</hi> and
others; in the midland Counties under Sir
<hi>Jacob Aſhley</hi> an old Souldier; other Armies
were commanded by Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton,</hi> and
Colonel <hi>Goring,</hi> and in the North the Earl of
<hi>Newcaſtles</hi> great Army.</p>
            <p>Nor were the forces of Parliament inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our;
the cheif Army under the General <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex;
Waller</hi> commanded another; the Earl
of <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> to whom <hi>Crumwell,</hi> a ſtout
and ſucceſsful Souldier was joyned, led a
ſtrong Army toward the North, where the
Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> and his Son had good forces,
and Sir <hi>John Meldrum</hi> not far off; the Earl
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:49178:55"/>
of <hi>Denbigh</hi> a ſtout Commander was with a
fair Party about <hi>Strafford;</hi> and beſides theſe,
the great Scottiſh Army.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of that Summer the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
attempted a thing of great moment,
to beſiege <hi>Oxford,</hi> or at leaſt to block up the
King within that Town, which was endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
by two Armies, <hi>Eſſex</hi> on the one ſide,
and <hi>Waller</hi> on the other; but the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
them both, and with a few light Horſe,
eſcaping out of the Town, went to joyn with
his greater Armies.</p>
            <p>General <hi>Eſſex</hi> marched farther into the
Weſt, but the expedition proved unhappy
both to himſelf and the Parliament: <hi>Waller</hi>
followed the King, but in vain, for he could
not hinder his deſigned March, onely ſome
skirmiſhes happened between parts of their
Forces: but nothing was done of any great
moment, until <hi>Waller</hi> returned with his force
to encounter enemies in other places Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
were the ſucceſſes this Summer in moſt
parts of the Kingdom; in the Weſt, South,
and midland Counties, the Kings forces pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
above the Parliament, which perchance
had been ruined, if the North had not made
them amends with ſome atchievements, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
one great Victory.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Leve,</hi> with his Scottiſh forces coming
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:49178:56"/>
the laſt Winter into <hi>England,</hi> beſides the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of ſome Towns and Forts, had much
weakened <hi>Newcaſtles</hi> Army, leſſening their
number, not by fighting, but enduring the
ſharpneſs of that weather, which the other
could not ſo well doe. To <hi>Leven</hi> the Lord
<hi>Fairfax</hi> (after <hi>Selby</hi> was ſo miraculouſly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by valiant Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax)</hi> joyned
himſelf with all his forces, to whom alſo the
Earl of <hi>Mancheſter</hi> after his <hi>Lincoln</hi> expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
came with a gallant Army.</p>
            <p>Three Parliament Armies, under three Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals,
<hi>Leven, Mancheſter</hi> and <hi>Fairfax;</hi> with
great concord, and unanimity had marched
together, and with joyned forces had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged
the great City of <hi>York,</hi> whereof the
Earl of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> was Governour; to raiſe
the siege Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> was come with a
great Army out of the South; the three Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
left their ſiege to fight the Prince; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him alſo <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> having drawn his
forces out of <hi>York,</hi> ſerved; who on a great
plain called <hi>Marſton Moore</hi> gave battel to
the three Generals.</p>
            <p>This was the greateſt battel of the whole
civil war; never did greater Armies both in
number and ſtrength encounter, or drew
more bloud in one fight. The Victory at firſt
was almoſt gotten by the Royaliſts, whoſe
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:49178:56"/>
left Wing <hi>(Fairfax</hi> his men being diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taged
by the inconvenience of the ground)
had routed and put to flight the right wing
of the Parliamentarians: but this loſs was
more than recompenced in the other Wing;
where <hi>Crumwell</hi> (who fought under <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester)</hi>
charged with ſuch force and fury the
right wing of the Royaliſts, that he broke the
beſt Regiments which Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> had, and
put them all to flight: <hi>Crumwel,</hi> together
with <hi>David Leſley,</hi> purſued them; and wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about with his Horſe, came opportunely
to the releif of his oppreſſed friends in the
other Wing, where they ceaſed not, until
they had gained a compleat Victory, and all
Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> his Ordnance, his carriages,
and baggage were poſſeſſed by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarians.</p>
            <p>After this Victory, <hi>Rupert</hi> with the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of his forces fled into the South ſome of
the Victorious Armies Horſe in vain purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him for ſome miles; the Earl of <hi>Newca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,</hi>
with ſome of his choſen friends, leaving
<hi>York</hi> (of which City Sir <hi>Thomas Glenham</hi>
took the government) went to <hi>Scarborough;</hi>
where within a while after he took ſhipping,
and paſſed into <hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The three Generals, <hi>Leven, Mancheſter,</hi>
and <hi>Fairfax</hi> after this great Victory return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:49178:57"/>
to beſiege <hi>York;</hi> to whom that City ſoon
after, upon conditions, was rendered; after
which they divided their forces, and <hi>Leven</hi>
with his Scottiſh Army returning into the
North, about the end of that Summer took
the rich Town of <hi>Newcaſtle;</hi> about the ſame
time that the General <hi>Eſſex</hi> unfortunately
managed his buſineſs in the Weſt, and having
loſt all his Artillery, returned to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Summer the Queen paſſed into
<hi>France,</hi> and uſed great endeavour to raiſe aid
for the King her husband, among the Roman
Catholikes, but thoſe endeavours proved
fruitleſs, yet notwithſtanding, the War in
<hi>England,</hi> without ſtrangers help, went on
with rage and bloud enough.</p>
            <p>In midſt of theſe calamities of War, ſome
hope of peace began to appear (though it
ſoon vaniſhed again) and conditions were
propoſed both by King and Parliament; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which, in the following <hi>February</hi> (as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
ſhall be ſaid) they both treated. The
end of this year, and beginning of the next
were notably tragical in the puniſhment and
death of eminent men: the two <hi>Hothams,</hi>
Father and Son, having been condemned for
Treaſon, for breaking the truſt of Parliament,
and conſpiring with the enemy to betray
<hi>Hull,</hi> with other crimes, after they had been
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:49178:57"/>
impriſoned above a whole year in the Tower
of <hi>London,</hi> were this <hi>December</hi> both behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and Sir <hi>Alexander Carew</hi> not many
dayes before, who was condemned for the
ſame crime, ſuffered the ſame puniſhment:
Famous alſo at that time was the death of
<hi>William Laud</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury;</hi>
the crimes objected againſt him were too
many, and of too various a nature to be here
related: four years almoſt had this unhappy
old man been a priſoner, yet not enjoyed ſo
much as the quiet of a priſon; for often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
(about fourſcore ſeveral dayes) he was
carried from the Tower to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and
there arraigned in the Houſe of Lords; ſo
the Fates were pleaſed in a ſad compenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to equal his adverſity, even in time with
his proſperity.</p>
            <p>This <hi>January</hi> he was beheaded, his life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſpun out ſo long, till he might ſee (which
was the obſervation of many) ſome few daies
before his death, the book of Liturgy abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed,
and the Directory, compoſed by the
<hi>Sinod</hi> at <hi>Weſtminster,</hi> eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>Though the King and Parliament were
both thinking of a Treaty for Peace, yet the
care of War was not neglected; the King
being ſolicitous about getting of forreign
aid, and the Parliament about new modelling
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49178:58"/>
their own Army: About this buſineſs (which
ſeemed of the higheſt concern) there was
ſome debate between the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons;
the Lords were againſt that Change,
alleagïng that there was no need of new
Commanders, where the old ones could be
accuſed of no fault, that men of the nobleſt
rank were fitteſt to command Armies, the
contrary whereof might breed confuſion in
the Common-wealth. The Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
on the other ſide, though they made a
noble mention of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and
thoſe other Peers, which commanded in the
Armies, alleaged notwithſtanding that the
Parliament forces had been often diſtracted
through the emulation of Commanders, from
whence it proceeded, that ſome things very
well deſigned, had not had a proſperous iſſue,
that the Army would be better diſciplined
under one ſole Commander.</p>
            <p>At laſt, when they were agreed, a General
was choſen to command the new Army,
which was Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> a man of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
valour, and as much modeſty, who was
then abſent in the North; but ſo great a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
could not ſuddainly be finiſhed: and
now the time approached for the Treaty of
<hi>Vxbridge,</hi> in which three heads were to be
debated.</p>
            <list>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:49178:58"/>
               <item>1. Of Religion and Church government.</item>

               </item>
            </list>
            <p>But the King, before this Treaty began,
uſed all meanes to aſſure himſelf of forreign
aid; by Letters he urged the Queen, who was
then in <hi>France,</hi> to ſolicite that King, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Catholikes to aſſiſt him, and that the
Queen Regent would detain the Parliaments
Ships in <hi>France.</hi> He was very earneſt likewiſe
for aſſiſtance from the Duke of <hi>Lorraign,</hi> that
he might get into <hi>England</hi> that wicked Army
of his, ſo notorious through <hi>Germany</hi> and
<hi>Flanders</hi> for all Villany; of which Army, as
of that of <hi>Marius,</hi> when the entred <hi>Rome,</hi> it
may be ſaid.</p>

            </q>
            <p>At laſt hope was given him from the Duke
of <hi>Lorraign,</hi> of ten thouſand men; and for
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:49178:59"/>
bringing of theſe Souldiers into <hi>England,
Goffe</hi> was ſent into <hi>Holland</hi> to negotiate for
ſhipping and other neceſſaries.</p>
            <p>The King likewiſe deſired aſſiſtance at
that time from the bloudy Iriſh Rebels, and
by his Letters commanded <hi>Ormond</hi> to make a
peace with thoſe Rebels, and to promiſe and
grant to them a free exerciſe of their popiſh
Religion, and to aſſure them, that if by their
aſſiſtance he could but finiſh his War in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
he would abrogate all thoſe Laws here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
made againſt the Papiſts there: he
gave thanks likewiſe to <hi>Muskery, Plunket,</hi>
and other of thoſe Rebels, promiſing a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
for all that was paſt. But they were much
troubled at the Treaty for peace with the
Parliament, not being ignorant, that one
neceſſary condition of ſuch a peace muſt be,
that the War in <hi>Ireland</hi> againſt them ſhould
be continued and proſecuted: The King
therefore, to remove this their ſcrupulous
fear, wrote to <hi>Ormond</hi> to this effect: <hi>That he
could not refuſe to make a peace with his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
onely in favour of thoſe Iriſh; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
from that very conſideration (if</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund
<hi>handled the matter wiſely) he might raiſe
an advantage to haſten a peace with thoſe Iriſh,
in letting them know their own danger, how they
were excluded from all hope of pardon by the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:49178:59"/>
Parliament, For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if we agree upon all
other conditions, it will not be convenient for me
to diſagree onely concerning thoſe Iriſh; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let them take what I offer, while time is, and
haſten the Peace, and when once my faith is
paſſed, no humane force ſhall make me break it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Queen alſo (remaining in <hi>France)</hi>
writing to her husband, ſeemed to grieve
much, that at <hi>Vxbridge</hi> they were to treat of
<hi>Religion</hi> in the firſt place; affirming, <hi>That if
any thing ſevere againſt the Catholikes ſhould
be concluded, and yet a peace not be made, the
King could not hope hereafter for any aſſiſtance
from the Catholike Princes, or from the Iriſh,
who muſt needs think, that after they had done
their beſt, they ſhould at laſt be forſaken.</hi> She
often entreats the King, that he would never
forſake the Biſhops, the Catholikes, nor thoſe
faithful friends of his that ſerved him in his
Wars: the King promiſeth her, that he would
never forſake his friends for a peace, onely
perſwades her to haſten, as much as ſhe can,
the aides from <hi>France,</hi> ſaying, <hi>That whileſt</hi>
London <hi>is diſtracted between the Preſbiterians
and Independents, both may be ruined.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>February</hi> the Commiſſioners on both
ſides met at <hi>Vxbridge</hi> to treat for peace. For
the King came the Duke of <hi>Richmond,</hi> the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:49178:60"/>
Marqueſs of <hi>Hartford,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Southamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
Dorſet</hi> and <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> the Lords, <hi>Dunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi>
and <hi>Capel,</hi> with <hi>Seimour, Culpeper, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner,
Hide, Lane, Bridgman, Palmer,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
For the Parliament, the Earls of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,
Pembrooke, Salisbury,</hi> and <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigh;</hi>
of the Houſe of Commons, <hi>Wainmar,
Vane, Perpoint, Hollis, Prideaux, Saint John,
Whitlock,</hi> and <hi>Crew;</hi> and beſides theſe, ſix
Commiſſioners of the Nobility and Gentry
of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But nothing at all was concluded at that
Treaty. The King would by no means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to the abrogation of Epiſcopacy; not
in the ſecond place, would he ſuffer the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia</hi>
to be taken out of his hands, which he
conceived to be a cheif flower of his Crown.
Yet he was contented that for three yeares it
ſhould be governed by twenty equally cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
out of both ſides. Laſtly, to the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a War againſt the Iriſh he could not
conſent, having made a ceſſation of Arms
with them, which in Honour he could not
break.</p>
            <p>Thus nothing at all being done toward
peace, the War muſt decide it. The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
haſten the modelling of their new Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
The Earls of <hi>Eſſex, Warwick, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49178:60"/>
lay down their Commiſſions.</p>
            <p>The new modelled Army of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
conſiſted of twenty one thouſand,
namely, fourteen thouſand foot, ſix thouſand
Horſe, and one thouſand Dragoneers. Sir
<hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> was made General; <hi>Philip
Skippon,</hi> an excellent ſouldier, was made Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
General: Colonels of the Foot Regiments
were <hi>Holborn, Forteſcue, Barclay, Craford, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>golesby,

Graves, Vermuden, Whaley, Fleetwood,
Roſſiter, Py.</hi> The King on the other ſide had
great Forces under divers Commanders, to
whom he diſtributed ſeveral Provinces: the
Princes <hi>Rupert,</hi> and <hi>Maurice,</hi> with numerous
forces poſſeſſed ſome of the Northern parts
of the Kingdom; others were held by the
Earl of <hi>Derby,</hi> and Sir <hi>Marmaduke Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale:</hi>
Sir <hi>John Biron</hi> and <hi>Gerard</hi> held <hi>Wales</hi>
and ſome adjacent Counties. The Weſt was
wholly poſſeſſed by three Armies of his, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the ſeveral Commands of Sir <hi>Ralph Hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
Sir <hi>Richard Greenvile,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Goring.</hi>
All theſe three, though Generals by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
yet ſerved under the name of <hi>Charles</hi>
Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> as their ſupreme General.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:49178:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But the King, not content with ſo great a
force of Engliſh Souldiers, was more earneſt
than before, to get over the Iriſh Papiſts,
with whom he had before committed the
buſineſs to <hi>Ormund</hi> to make an abſolute
peace: but when the King perceived that
thoſe Iriſh made too high demands, and that
nothing was effected by <hi>Ormund</hi> toward the
peace in ſo many Treaties, and ſo long a time,
he thought of another way, which was, to
the Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> of <hi>Ragland,</hi> Son to <hi>Worce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>
(whom he had created Earl of <hi>Glamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan)</hi>
a zealous Papiſt, and therefore moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to thoſe Iriſh Rebels; the King
gave full power by his Letters, to make a
peace with, and indulge to the Iriſh whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſhould ſeem needful: It ſeemed ſtrange
to all men (when theſe things were brought
to light, which was before the end of that
year) that ſuch a buſineſs ſhould be carried
on, and yet concealed from the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi>
Secretary for <hi>Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Ormund</hi> the Lord
Lieutenant, to whom the whole matter of
that peace had been before committed.</p>
            <p>But the King, when he ſaw it too hard a
thing otherwiſe to make ſuch a peace, as
would bring a certainty of aſſiſtance from
them, that he might throw all that Envy upon
<hi>Glamorgan,</hi> impowred him, unknown to the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:49178:61"/>
reſt: for ſo the Rebels, ſweetened with large
promiſes (unknown to <hi>Ormund)</hi> might the
better admit of conditions juſt in ſhew, and
openly excuſable, and the King might draw
from <hi>Ireland</hi> ſuch Souldiers as would more
firmly adhere to his ſide, and he might truſt
(as being the greateſt haters of Engliſh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,
and deſpairing of pardon) againſt
the Parliament of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He therefore gave Letters of authority to
<hi>Glamorgan,</hi> in theſe words:</p>

gave him his Commiſſion, to be Lord Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and General of all his
forces; the King then alſo ſent for the Earl
of <hi>Antrim,</hi> to participate with <hi>Montroſs</hi> his
Councels, who entering into a confederacy
with him before the King, engaged himſelf
there, that he would ſend to <hi>Montroſs</hi> the
next <hi>April</hi> into <hi>Arguile</hi> (where the paſſage

performed in part, but was very defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
in the number of Souldiers, for inſtead of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:49178:62"/>
ten thouſand, he ſent ſcarce twelve hundred
Iriſh into <hi>Scotland</hi> under the conduct of
<hi>Macdonald. Montroſs</hi> notwithſtanding with
theſe men, with the addition of his Atholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
made up a ſufficient theeving Army, and
making ſudden excurſions, he fell into the
neighbouring Countries, waſting all, robbing
houſes, and burning up the Corn where he
came, inſomuch as that the State had need of
great Armies to reſtrain his violence, whilſt
the craggy Mountains of Atholia, and rough
woody places there gave ſafe retreat to his
Highlanders and Iriſh.</p>
            <p>In this manner did <hi>Montroſs,</hi> for the ſpace
almoſt of two years, lie within the bowels of
his Country like a peſtilent diſeaſe; ſuch were
his retreats, and ſo great his boldneſs in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that no leſs an Army than twelve
thouſand was thought ſufficient to defend the
Provinces againſt him.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Montroſs</hi> was toſſed with various
turns of Fortune. The firſt Summer after his
arrival in <hi>Scotland,</hi> he gave the Earl of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile</hi>
a great blow, through the negligence of
his men, where fifteen hundred were ſlain and
taken by <hi>Montroſs;</hi> whereupon the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Scotland</hi> raiſed an Army of ten
thouſand againſt him, and the ſame parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
condemned <hi>Montroſs</hi> (with ſome other
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:49178:63"/>
Lords) to be a Traitor and Enemy to his
Country. <hi>Montroſs</hi> afterwards received a
great overthrow from <hi>Hurry,</hi> and was enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to fly to his craggy retreats; and ſhortly
after he was again beaten by <hi>Hurry</hi> near to
<hi>Dundee,</hi> and abſolutely forced to hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in his old receptacles: from whence not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
on a ſudden (as ſhall be ſhewed
anon) he ſhewed himſelf, and from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
eſtate grown juſtly formidable, he
overwhelmed <hi>Scotland</hi> in a miſerable cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
            <p>While the King perſiſted in theſe courſes,
the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> from the Synod at <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinburgh</hi>
ſent Letters to him, containing a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
admonition; which (becauſe the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition
of a National Church may ſeem a
thing of ſome moment) ſhall be ſet down
<hi>verbatim,</hi> the Preface onely omitted, becauſe
long, though very humble.</p>
            <p>THE troubles of our hearts are enlarged,
and our fears encreaſed in your Majeſties
behalf, perceiving that your Peoples patience is
above meaſure tempted, &amp; is like a Cart preſſed
down with Sheaves, and ready to break, while
as beſides many former deſigns and endeavours
to bring deſolation and deſtruction upon us,
which were (and we truſt all of that kind ſhall
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:49178:63"/>
be) by the marvellous and merciful providence
of God diſcovered and diſappointed; our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
is now infeſted, the bloud of divers of our
brethren ſpilt, and other acts of moſt barbarous
and horrid cruelty exerciſed by the curſed crew
of the Iriſh Rebels, and their complices in this
Kingdom, under the conduct of ſuch as have
Commiſſion and Warrant from your Majeſty:
and unleſs we prove unfaithful both to God and
your Majeſty, we cannot conceal another dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
which is infinitely greater than your Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
diſpleaſure. Therefore, we, the ſervants of
the moſt high God, and your Majeſties moſt
loyal Subjects, in the humility and grief of our
hearts, fall down before your Throne, and in the
name of our Lord and Maſter Jeſus Chriſt,
who ſhall judge the World in Righteouſneſs,
both great and ſmall; and in the name of this
whole Nationall Kirk, which we repreſent, we
make bold to warn your Majeſty freely, that
the guilt which cleaveth faſt to your Majeſty,
and to your Throne, is ſuch, as (whatſoever
flattering Preachers, or unfaithful Counſellors
may ſay to the contrary) if not timely repented,
cannot but involve your ſelf, and your poſterity
under the wrath of the ever living God: for your
being guilty of the ſhedding of the bloud of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thouſands of your Majeſties beſt ſubjects:
for your permitting the Maſs, and other Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:49178:64"/>
both in your own Family, &amp; in your Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
for your authorizing by the book of ſports,
the prophanation of the Lords day: for your
not puniſhing of publike ſcandals, and much
prophaneneſs in and about your Court: for the
ſhutting of your ears from the humble and juſt
deſires of your faithful ſubjects: for your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
too much with the popiſh party many
wayes, and namely by concluding the ceſſation of
Armes in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and your embracing the
councels of thoſe who have not ſet God nor your
good before their eyes: for your reſiſting and
oppoſing this cauſe, which ſo much concerneth
the glory of God, your own honour, and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and the peace, and ſafety of your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes:
and for what other cauſes, your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
is moſt conſcious, and may beſt judge and
search your own conſcience (nor would we have
mentioned any particulars, if they had not been
publike and known) For all which it is high time
for your Majeſty to fall down at the foot-ſtool of
the King of glory, to acknowledge your offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
to repent timely, to make your peace with
God through Jeſus Chriſt (whoſe bloud is able
to waſh away your great ſins) and to be no
longer unwilling that the Son of God reign over
you, and your Kingdoms, in his pure Ordinances
of Church-government and Worſhip.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:49178:64"/>
They conclude with a profeſſion and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation
of their conſtancy in ſo juſt a cauſe,
againſt any oppoſition whatſoever. This ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition
of the generall Aſſembly of the
Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi> was ſent firſt to the Scottiſh
Commiſſioners at <hi>London,</hi> and by them deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to the Kings Secretary, but Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
admonition, in the heat of War, little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed.</p>
            <p>When the Spring began, the War with
great heat and courage on both ſides was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed.
Generall <hi>Eſſex</hi> had laid down his
Commiſſion, and Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> went
to <hi>Windſor</hi> to his new-modelled Army; a
new Army indeed, made up of ſome remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the old ones, and other raiſed forces
in the Countries; an Army ſeeming no way
glorious either in the dignity of Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
or antiquity of Souldiers; never hardly
did any Army go forth to War with leſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
of their own ſide, or more contempt
of their enemies, and did more bravely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
both, and ſhew how far it was poſſible
for humane conjectures to erre. For in their
following action; and ſucceſſes they proved
ſuch, as would too much poſe antiquity, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
all the Camps of their famed <hi>Heroes,</hi>
to find a parallel to this Army.</p>
            <p>He that will ſeriouſly weigh their atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:49178:65"/>
in the following year, againſt potent
and gallant Enemies, and conſider the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of things, the number of Victories, how
many battels were woon, how many Towns
and Garriſons were taken, he can hardly
think them the work of one year, or fit to be
called one War.</p>
            <p>But whoſoever conſiders this, muſt take
heed that he do not attribute too much to
them, but give it wholly to Almighty God,
whoſe providence over this Army, as it did
afterwards miraculouſly appear, ſo it might
in ſome meaſure be hoped for at the firſt,
conſidering the behaviour and diſcipline of
thoſe Souldiers. For the uſual vices of Camps
were here reſtrained, the diſcipline was ſtrict,
no theft, no wantonneſs, no oaths, nor any
prophane words could eſcape without the
ſevereſt caſtigation; by which it was brought
to paſs, that in this Camp, as in a well ordered
City, paſſage was ſafe, and commerce free.</p>
            <p>The firſt expedition of General <hi>Fairfax,</hi>
as it was ordered by the Committee of both
Kingdomes, was into the Weſt, to releive
<hi>Taunton;</hi> a Town that had long, with incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
manhood and conſtancy, under <hi>Blake</hi>
their Governour, endured a ſharp ſiege by
Sir <hi>Richard Greenvile,</hi> and ſeemed to emulate
(though with more happineſs) the fidelity of
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:49178:65"/>
old <hi>Sagunthum:</hi> but this work was not done
by the General himſelf, but Colonel <hi>Welden,</hi>
who was ſent thither with ſeven thouſand of
the new Army. <hi>Fairfax</hi> himſelf was recalled
by the Committee of both Kingdoms to go
upon other action.</p>
            <p>But becauſe the King had ſent for Prince
<hi>Rupert</hi> from <hi>Wales</hi> to come to <hi>Oxford,</hi> that
he might joyn forces, and march into the
field; General <hi>Fairfax,</hi> before he went from
<hi>Windſor,</hi> ſent <hi>Cromwell</hi> with a party of Horſe
to hinder the Kings deſigns; who marching
ſpeedily from <hi>Windſor,</hi> with great felicity
vanquiſhed a part of the Kings forces at <hi>Iſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi>
taking divers of the Commanders
priſoners, the remainder of that party flying
into <hi>Bletchington</hi> Houſe, were there beſieged,
and yeilded to <hi>Cromwell;</hi> with the ſame ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
at <hi>Bampton-buſh</hi> he took <hi>Vaughan</hi> and
<hi>Littleton,</hi> and defeated their forces.</p>
            <p>The King, when Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> and <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi>
were come to him with their forces, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
his march toward the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> to take
poſſeſſion of the Iſle of <hi>Ely,</hi> which he hoped
would be betrayed to him by ſome of his
party there. <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and Major General
<hi>Brown</hi> the Governor of <hi>Abington,</hi> were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to follow the King, but ſoon recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
as too weak in forces to encounter the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:49178:66"/>
King, and to aſſiſt General <hi>Fairfax</hi> in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieging
of <hi>Oxford,</hi> for then <hi>Fairfax</hi> was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
to beſiege <hi>Oxford;</hi> but the deſign was
not good, and the Commmittee of both
Kingdoms, though too late, repented it.</p>
            <p>For in the mean time the King ſecurely
marched Northward with his Army, and took
the conſiderable Town of <hi>Leiceſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fairfax</hi> recalled from the ſiege of <hi>Oxford,</hi>
(while <hi>Cromwell</hi> was ſent away to ſtrengthen
the Eaſtern Counties) with all his forces
followed the King; nor was the famous
battel long deſerred, in which all men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured
what the liberties and Laws of
<hi>England,</hi> and what the Kings power ſhould
he, muſt be tried by the ſword. <hi>Naſeby</hi> fields,
not far from <hi>Northampton,</hi> were the place
where the fate of <hi>England</hi> was to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.
The fourteenth of <hi>June</hi> was the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable
day: nor was the number of the
Armies very unequal (the Royaliſts onely
were ſtrongeſt in Horſe) nor the ordering
of their Battaliaes much unlike: The Kings
Front was filled with brave Troops of Horſe;
the Foot ſtood in the ſecond Body. The right
wing was commanded by the Princes, <hi>Rupert</hi>
and <hi>Maurice;</hi> the left by Sir <hi>Jacob Aſhley,</hi>
other Commanders of great quality ſuſtein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their parts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:49178:66"/>
The Parliamentarian Foot made a firm
Body in the midſt. The wings were guarded
by the Horſe, the right wing was commanded
by <hi>Cromwell,</hi> who to the exceeding joy of the
whole Army, that very night before the
battel was fought arrived there: the left
wing by <hi>Ireton:</hi> Colonel <hi>Roſſiter,</hi> a brave
Commander, but a little before the battel
began, came with his Horſe, and took his
place with <hi>Cromwell</hi> on the right wing: the
Foot was commanded by Major Generall
<hi>Skippon,</hi> and divided into two Bodies. The
Parliamentarians word was, <hi>God with us.</hi> The
Roialiſts, <hi>God and Queen</hi> Mary.</p>
            <p>Fortune at the firſt (as in ſome other bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels)
ſeemed a while to ſlatter the Kings ſide,
for the left wing of the Parliament was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,
and the Commander <hi>Ireton,</hi> receiving
two wounds, was taken Priſoner, and kept
ſo during the fight. Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> with great
fury fell in, and purſued that routed wing,
inſomuch that the day had been loſt, if
<hi>Cromwell,</hi> who came on with as great force,
had not in like manner routed and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
the Kings left wing: the buſineſs now
ſeemed in an equal ballance, and the wings
on both ſides being thus ſcattered, they
fought ſome time upon dubious hopes:
magnanimous <hi>Skippon</hi> was grievouſly
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:49178:67"/>
wounded, yet would not forſake the battel,
but with all poſſible endeavours diſcharged
his part till the Victory was obtained: the
<hi>Fairfaxians</hi> at laſt charged ſo fiercely upon
the Roialiſts, that they no longer could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the brunt; the Horſe in all diſordered
haſt fled toward <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> and forſook the
whole body of their Foot, with their Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery
and carriages, who being ſurrounded
by the <hi>Fairfaxians,</hi> threw down their Arms,
crying for Quarter, and were all taken Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
            <p>This battel was the happieſt of all other to
the Parliament, the Victory abſolute, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted,
and almoſt five thouſand priſoners
carried to <hi>London;</hi> the Kings Standard, and
one hundred other colours were taken, with
all their Ordnance, and a very rich booty;
a great quantity of gold and ſilver, and all
the ſecret Letters of the King came by this
meanes into the Conquerous hands; but ſo
few were ſlain in this battel, that a reader
may juſtly wonder how ſo many priſoners
ſhould be taken, and ſo much wealth pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
with the loſs of ſo little bloud, for on
the Kings ſide ſcarce four hundred were
ſlain, on the Parliaments ſcarce an hundred.
<hi>Cromwell</hi> with his Horſe purſued the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed
Roialiſts (who fled apace, and betook
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:49178:67"/>
themſelves to divers of their own Garriſons)
and bringing back a great number of Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
returned to the General, who now
marched with his Victorious Army to <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi>
which was ſoon rendred to him. <hi>Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax,</hi>
leaving a Garriſon in <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> that he
might make uſe of his Victory to the good
of the Common-wealth, and hinder the King
from recruiting himſelf, to protract this ſad
War, reſolved to follow him cloſe; he
therefore marched Weſtward, that he might
both purſue the King, and raiſe the Siege of
<hi>Taunton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Kings letters taken at <hi>Naſeby</hi> were
publikely read in <hi>London</hi> before a great
Aſſembly of Citizens, where many of both
Houſes of Parliament were preſent, and leave
was given to as many as pleaſed, or knew the
Kings hand (to refute the calumny of thoſe
who ſaid the Letters were counterfeit) to
peruſe them all, out of which a ſelected bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
were printed by command of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>From the reading of theſe Letters many
diſcourſes of the people aroſe, for there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
his tranſactions with the Iriſh Rebels,
and with the Queen for aſſiſtance from
<hi>France,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Lorraign,</hi> of which
before is ſpoken. Many good men were ſorry
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:49178:68"/>
that the Kings actions agreed no better with
his words; that he openly proteſted before
God, with horrid imprecations, that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
nothing ſo much as the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Proteſtant Religion, and rooting out
of Popery: yet in the mean time under hand
he promiſed to the Iriſh Rebels an abrogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of thoſe Laws againſt them, which was
contrary to his late expreſſed promiſes, in
theſe words, <hi>I will never abrogate the Law
againſt the Papiſts:</hi> and again, <hi>I abhor to
think of bringing forraign Souldiers into the
Kingdom:</hi> and yet he ſolicited the Duke of
<hi>Lorraign,</hi> the <hi>French,</hi> the <hi>Danes,</hi> and the very
<hi>Iriſh</hi> for aſſiſtance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they were vexed alſo, that
the King was ſo much ruled by the will of his
wife, as to do every thing by her preſcript,
that <hi>Peace, War, Religion,</hi> and Parliament
ſhould be at her diſpoſal.</p>
            <p>It appeared beſides out of thoſe Letters,
with what mind the King treated with the
Parliament at <hi>Vxbridge,</hi> and what could be
hoped by that Treaty, when writing to the
Queen, he affirms, that if he could have had
but two more donſenting to his Vote, he
would not have given the name of Parliament
to them at <hi>Weſtminſter:</hi> at laſt he agreed to
it in this ſenſe, <hi>That it was not all one to call
them a Parliament, and to acknowledge them ſo
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:49178:68"/>
to be;</hi> and upon that reaſon (which might
have diſpleaſed his own ſide) he calls thoſe
with him at <hi>Oxford, a mungrel Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King, after his overthrow at <hi>Naſeby,</hi>
fled to <hi>Lichfield,</hi> and from thence he went to
<hi>Hereford,</hi> to raiſe forces (eſpecially Foot, for
he had ſtill ſtore of brave Horſe, that came to
him after that Battel) in <hi>Wales,</hi> in <hi>Cornwall,</hi>
and in other places; but nothing at all that
following year proſpered with the King,
Fortune enclining wholly to the Parliaments
ſide, whoſe cauſe it appeared that God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
by the grant of ſo many ſtrange and
ſignal Victories to them; the valour of the
Roialiſts availed not, and all their endeavours
fell to nothing.</p>
            <p>General <hi>Fairfax,</hi> after the Battel of <hi>Naſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi>
by long Marches paſſed into the Weſt.
<hi>Taunton</hi> was releived onely by the fame of
his approach, for <hi>Goring</hi> raiſed his Siege, and
went away: That conſtant Town had been
reduced to great extremities; it had ſuffered
much, and done great things againſt ſtrong
Enemies, and could not at this time in poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
have held out long without ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leif.
The Parliament rejoyced much at the
delivery of that Town; three Parliament
Garriſons about that time, and the foregoing
year, behaved themſelves with ſuch courage
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:49178:69"/>
and conſtancy, as might deſerve to be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
in a larger Hiſtory, <hi>viz. Lime, Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi>
and <hi>Taunton,</hi> all which, having been
often beſieged by Prince <hi>Maurice, Greenvile,
Goring,</hi> and other Commanders, had not
onely held out againſt thoſe ſtrong Enemies,
but much broken their Forces.</p>
            <p>The things which that new Army under
the conduct of <hi>Fairfax</hi> did that following
year (taking no reſt all that ſharp and bitter
Winter) were much to be wondred at, how
many ſtrong Towns and Forts they took,
how many field Victories they obtained, the
ſtories of evey ſeveral moneth will declare;
of which, becauſe they are more acurately
deſcribed by other pens, I ſhall here onely
make a ſhort mention; for within the ſpace
of one year all the Weſtern Counties of
<hi>England,</hi> great Armies under the conduct of
Prince <hi>Rupert, Greenvile, Hopton,</hi> and <hi>Goring,</hi>
being utterly vanquiſhed and brought to
nothing, were reduced to the obedience of
Parliament.</p>
            <p>In the moneths of <hi>Auguſt</hi> and <hi>September</hi>
were taken <hi>Bath,</hi> and <hi>Sherburn,</hi> and <hi>Briſtol</hi>
it ſelf, the greateſt and moſt wealthieſt City
of the whole Weſt, was by Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred
to General <hi>Fairfax.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Army alſo, when it was divided, by
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:49178:69"/>
reaſon of the multiplicity of their work, was
not leſs ſucceſsful in the parts of it; <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi>
and <hi>Baſing</hi> taken by <hi>Cromwel,</hi> the
<hi>Devizes</hi> and <hi>Barclay</hi> by other Commanders,
<hi>Fairfax</hi> himſelf marching (that cold <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber)</hi>
into <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> took <hi>Tiverton,</hi> and with
ſtrange felicity ſtormed and took <hi>Dartmouth,</hi>
and afterwards drove the Kings Armies into
<hi>Cornwall,</hi> whom <hi>Fairfax</hi> purſuing, at <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington</hi>
gave <hi>Hopton</hi> a great overthrow. In
the moneth of <hi>February</hi> with his Victorious
Army he entred <hi>Cornwall,</hi> for fear of whom
Prince <hi>Charles</hi> fled into the Iſlands of <hi>Silly;</hi>
and in <hi>March</hi> following, all <hi>Hoptons</hi> forces,
by the Command of the Conquerour <hi>Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax,</hi>
were disbanded and ſent away, and the
whole County of <hi>Cornwall</hi> reduced to the
obedience of Parliament.</p>
            <p>In the following <hi>April, Exceſter,</hi> and
<hi>Barnſtable</hi> were ſurrendred to <hi>Fairfax,</hi> and
<hi>Bridgewater</hi> ſtormed, but when they yeilded,
taken to mercy. S. <hi>Michaels Mount,</hi> the
fartheſt angle of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> was alſo ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
to Collonel <hi>Hamond.</hi> Thus <hi>Fairfax,</hi> the
Conquerour of the Weſt, having fitted all
things for his expedition, to make an end of
the War, is marching to beſiege <hi>Oxford:
Woodſtock</hi> was already taken by Colonel
<hi>Rainsborough;</hi> but in all theſe moneths that
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:49178:70"/>
the General had done ſuch great things in
the Weſt, the other Commanders of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were not unfortunate (the Fates ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to conſpire at that ſide) in the North,
and midland Counties of <hi>England;</hi> about
the midſt of Summer <hi>Carliſe</hi> was ſurrendered
by <hi>Glenham</hi> the Governour, to the Scottiſh
Army, a Garriſon of Scots was put into that
Town, of which the Engliſh complained, as
being againſt the Covenant: the Parliament
alſo wrote to <hi>Leven</hi> to reſtore <hi>Carliſle</hi> to the
Engliſh; not that they did ſuſpect any evil
from their Brethren, but that conditions
might be obſerved, and the mouths of ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected
people ſtopped, who were too apt
to ſay, that <hi>The Scots came into</hi> England, <hi>not
as friends, but Freebooters:</hi> From that time the
Parliament ordained to have their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners
(as the Scots had theirs at <hi>London)</hi>
reſident in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to be preſent with the
Parliament of <hi>Scotland:</hi> and to that purpoſe
the Earl of <hi>Rutband,</hi> the Lord <hi>Wharton;</hi> and
of the Commons, Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> the Elder,
Sir <hi>William Armin,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hatcher,</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Goodwin</hi> were choſen <hi>Glenham</hi> with his men,
after the ſurrender of <hi>Carliſle,</hi> went to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arke.</hi>
The Scottiſh Army about that time
marched under <hi>Leven</hi> to <hi>Newark,</hi> to beſiege
that Town, but the Scottiſh horſe ſtaid not
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:49178:70"/>
long there, being forced to return into the
North, to the aſſiſtance of their diſtreſſed
Countrey. For the Engliſh Parliament at that
time, in midſt of their own proſperity, were
notwithſtanding mourners for the calamity
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> a great, unexpected, and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
calamity; in which the frailty of humane
affairs, and the mutable condition of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
was ſet forth by a memorable example;
all <hi>Scotland</hi> within the ſpace of one moneth
was loſt and recovered, quite ſunk, and again
emergent.</p>
            <p>The man that thus plagued <hi>Scotland,</hi> was
the Earl of <hi>Montroſs,</hi> one on whom the
Kings hopes ſo much then depended, that
out of an earneſt deſire to joyn his forces
to <hi>Montroſs,</hi> the King with a body of good
horſe marched Northward, but by the forces
of <hi>Pointz, Gell, Roſſiter,</hi> and others, the Kings
expedition was ſtopped, that he could not
meet <hi>Montroſs:</hi> for it had been agreed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the King and <hi>Montroſs,</hi> that at the
ſame time he from the South ſhould march
Northward and the other from the North, to
meet him, ſhould come Southward, that the
Kings horſe joyned to his foot, might make a
conſiderable Army in thoſe parts; but the
Kings paſſage, though he tryed many wayes,
was (as beforeſaid) ſtopped. <hi>Montroſs</hi>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:49178:71"/>
mindful of his promiſe, broke out into the
Southern parts of <hi>Scotland,</hi> with greater ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
than could be hoped, having ſcarce 4000.
Highlanders and Iriſh.</p>
            <p>A place there was neer to <hi>Kilſithe,</hi> which
the craggy Mountains and ſtraitened paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
had made fit for ambuſhes, where <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſs</hi>
had ſeated himſelf, thither the Army of
the State, confident of their number, whileſt
unadviſedly they purſued the theeving High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,
fell into the cunningly-diſpoſed
ambuſhes, and were cut off with a miſerable
ſlaughter; above five thouſand were ſlain,
and none almoſt eſcaped, but whom the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
Conquerours had not ſtrength to kill, for
cruel <hi>Montroſs</hi> ſpared none, crying out, <hi>They
had no need of Priſoners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>This overthrow of <hi>Kilſithe</hi> at one battle
had utterly ruined the State of <hi>Scotland,</hi> if
<hi>David Leſley</hi> (about a moneth after giving
an abſolute overthrow to <hi>Montroſs)</hi> had not
reſtored it; for after this ſo unexpected a
defeat, the State of <hi>Scotland</hi> had no Army for
a Reſerve, or Force to ſtop the paſſage of the
Conquerour, to whom almoſt all their Towns
preſently yeilded. The papiſts and Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
and all neuters, with thoſe that had
before diſſembled their affections, now
joyned with him, the reſt were cut off; all the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:49178:71"/>
chief Nobility of the Covenanters were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to fly into <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A publike Faſt and Humiliation was kept
by the Engliſh, for the calamity of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
of</hi> Scotland <hi>General</hi> Fairfax, <hi>and other
of the chief Commanders wrote to</hi> Leven,
That they accounted the Calamity of <hi>Scotland</hi>
to be their own; and that if their affairs at home
would permit, and the Parliament would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
it, they would earneſtly undertake that
War, and venture their blouds as freely for the
Scots as for the Engliſh, till the Enemies of the
three Kingdoms were fully vanquiſhed.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Montroſs</hi> his cruell raign laſted not
long, ſcarce a whole moneth; to vindicate
<hi>Scotland David Leſley</hi> was ſufficient, who
with his Horſe coming thither, at <hi>Selkirk</hi>
gave <hi>Montroſs</hi> ſo total a defeat, that it ſeemed
fully to recompence <hi>Kilſithe;</hi> the Victory
was gotten in an hours ſpace, and (as it was
obſerved by a <hi>German</hi> Writer) upon the ſame
day that the Queen of <hi>England</hi> at <hi>Paris</hi> was
ſinging <hi>Te Deum Laudamus</hi> for <hi>Montroſs</hi> his
Victory at <hi>Kilſithe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus was <hi>Scotland</hi> recovered before the
King could come to <hi>Montroſs;</hi> which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the King ſoon after attempted,
and marching Northward with a ſtrength
not contemptible, having <hi>Gerard</hi> and <hi>Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:49178:72"/>
with him, came to <hi>Routenheath,</hi> his deſign
was, that if he could not joyn with <hi>Montroſs,</hi>
yet at the leaſt that he might raiſe the Siege
of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> for the King was exceedingly ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous
for that City, as being the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
Haven to receive the tranſported
Iriſh, whom he ſo long in vain expected. But
that expedition proved moſt unfortunate to
the King; for in a battel fought upon <hi>Rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenheath,</hi>
where <hi>Pointz</hi> was Commander of the
Parliaments Army, the King was vanquiſhed,
and eight hundred of his men ſlain.</p>
            <p>Nor was the Lord <hi>Digbies</hi> expedition to
<hi>Montroſs</hi> more fortunate, who in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
moneth, together with <hi>Langdale,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
got together one thouſand Horſe, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
into the North to that purpoſe: for at
<hi>Sherburn</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire</hi> he was beaten, and put
to flight by <hi>Pointz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Copley,</hi> and other Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarians;
and afterwards at <hi>Carliſie</hi> he
was defeated by <hi>Brown</hi> and <hi>Leſley;</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
loſt all his forces, fled into the Iſle of
<hi>Man</hi> to the Earl of <hi>Derby,</hi> from whence
ſhortly after he paſſed into <hi>Ireland.</hi> When
<hi>Digby</hi> was defeated at <hi>Sherburn,</hi> other ſecret
Letters and papers of the Kings were taken,
whereby ſome deſigns of his were laid open,
and ſome things more cleerly diſcovered
about his tranſactions with <hi>Danes,</hi> Iriſh, and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:49178:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>
others: the Roialiſts at <hi>Oxford</hi> did much blame
<hi>Digby</hi> his carleſsneſs, that would carry ſuch
papers with him into a Battel, which were
ſcarce ſafe enough in the ſtrongeſt Fort, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
remembring what a ſtir was made about
the Letters taken at <hi>Naſeby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Digby</hi> was now in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and (about the
end of <hi>December)</hi> together with <hi>Ormund;</hi>
treating about a peace with the Iriſh; when
on a ſuddain the Kings affairs began to be
endangered there, by divulging of <hi>Glamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi>
ſecret tranſaction with the Iriſh Rebels,
of which we ſpake before; <hi>Ormund</hi> and <hi>Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi>
fearing leaſt if this diſcovery ſhould grow
too general among the people, that all the
former rumours would find credit; as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that the King was Author of the Iriſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
and ſought to confirm Popery, from
whence a general revolt of all the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
might be feared; and although <hi>Digby</hi>
thought <hi>Glamorgan</hi> to be an unadviſed man,
yet could not ſuppoſe him ſo fooliſh, as to
undertake ſuch a thing as that without any
warrant at all. Therefore it was agreed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them, that (for fear leaſt when this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
were grown more general<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it might
be too late to vindicate the King) <hi>Digby</hi>
ſhould preſently accuſe <hi>Glamorgan</hi> of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
But <hi>Ormund</hi> and <hi>Digby</hi> were both trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:49178:73"/>
with this fear, (becauſe at that time three
thouſand Iriſh were promiſed to go over to
the releif of <hi>Cheſter)</hi> leſt by this unſeaſonable
vindication of the King, <hi>Cheſter</hi> might be
loſt, for want of tranſportation of thoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
but when they underſtood that, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Glamorgans</hi> compact, thoſe Iriſh were
not to go for <hi>England,</hi> before the King had
made good the conditions which <hi>Glamorgan</hi>
promiſed, and confirmed the peace; and
while they were conſulting about this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
buſineſs, it was told them, That the
Proteſtants of <hi>Dublin,</hi> upon that news were
in a great mutiny, and the worſt was feared
within few hours, unleſs the danger were
ſpeedily prevented; <hi>Digby</hi> was enforced to
make haſt, and accuſe <hi>Glamorgan</hi> (who was
not at all diſmaid, knowing it was onely to
deceive the people) of high Treaſon, <hi>Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morgan</hi>
therefore with great confidence and
alacrity went to priſon, affirming, <hi>That he did
not fear to give account at</hi> London, <hi>or before
the Parliament, of what he had done by the Kings
warrant:</hi> but it was wonder to ſee what a
change in the Proteſtants at <hi>Dublin</hi> this
feigned accuſation of high Treaſon ſuddain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made, and they who before murmured were
now appeaſed,</p>
            <p>But yet there remained another difficulty
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:49178:73"/>
to be extricated; <hi>Ormund</hi> was fearful, leſt
the Iriſh, incenſed by this injury done to
<hi>Glamorgan,</hi> ſhould ſuddenly fly to Arms, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Kings forces were ready for them;
to prevent that danger, he wrote to <hi>Muskerry</hi>
concerning the reaſons of this action, and
the extream neceſſity; and withall he ſeemed
to approve the conditions for peace, as the
Rebels had propoſed them, and ſent them to
<hi>Kilkenny</hi> to be further diſcuſſed, with ſome
dubiouſneſs of the event, this might ſpend
time, until ſome new hopes of relieving <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
or otherwiſe ſupplying the King, might
ariſe.</p>
            <p>But all theſe devices nothing availed the
King, all his deſigns were fruſtrated, nor ever
could he bring into <hi>England</hi> an Army either
of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels, <hi>Lorraigners,</hi> or <hi>Danes,</hi> (God
providing better for that Kingdom) until at
laſt all his forces every where were vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and wholly ſubdued by the Parliament;
for in the following moneth, <hi>February,</hi> that
very City of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> for which he hath been
ſo ſolicitous, a City ſo often beſieged, and
now long defended by <hi>Biron,</hi> came into the
power of the Parliament; for <hi>Biron</hi> the
Governour upon honourable terms delivered
it up to <hi>Breerton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor was the Kings ſide more lucky in any
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:49178:74"/>
County of <hi>England;</hi> for beſides the whoſe
Weſt (that Winter, and the following Spring)
by many field-Victories, and gaining of
Towns, conquered by <hi>Fairfax;</hi> in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
Counties alſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the North, and in <hi>Wales,</hi>
in ſeveral battels all that time the Roialiſts
were vanquiſhed by eminent Commanders
of the Parliament, ſuch as were <hi>Maſſey,
Pointz, Brown, Roſſiter, Mitton, Gell, Breerton,
Laughorn,</hi> and others; and in the moneth of
<hi>March</hi> (which was the laſt noted field-Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory)
<hi>Aſhley</hi> himſelf the Kings General
was vanquiſhed by <hi>Morgan</hi> in a memorable
battel, and taken priſoner, with one thouſand
ſix hundred of his men. <hi>Aſhley,</hi> when he was
taken, ſpake aloud theſe words: <hi>You have
done your work, and wholly vanquiſhed the
Kings party, unleſs your own diſſentions raiſe
them again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At this time <hi>Newark</hi> the ſtrongeſt Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
of the Kings, which had long, and much
infeſted the adjacent Countries, was ſtraitly
beſieged by <hi>Leven, Pointz,</hi> and <hi>Roſſiter;</hi> and
General <hi>Fairfax,</hi> after reducing of the Weſt,
having provided what was ſit, haſtened to
beſiege <hi>Oxford,</hi> the head of the War. The
King having now no Garriſons left, but <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,
Wallingford, Worceſter, Ragland,</hi> and <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dennis,</hi>
all which in a ſhort time after, were
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:49178:74"/>
alſo taken, and could glory onely in this, that
they had held out after <hi>Oxford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The beſieged <hi>Newarkers,</hi> though the
Plague raged in the Town, and they began
to want victuals, yet ſuſteined themſelves
upon hopes of ſome diſſentions that might
ariſe between the Engliſh and the Scots.</p>
            <p>For now the Scots began to complain of
want of pay, of the neglect of Church-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and the Covenant: the Parliament
anſwered, that that Scottiſh Army in two
years ſpace had received above two hundred
thouſand pounds for pay, beſides a vaſt ſum
of money, which they had by force extorted
from the poor weeping Inhabitants of the
Northern Counties; and beſides that, their
Army had not ſatisfied the expectation of
the Engliſh, but had lyen idle in the beſt time
of the year; if they were ſo preciſe in obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the Covenant, why then, contrary
to the Covenant, did the Scots put Garriſons
into <hi>Newcastle, Tinmouth</hi> and <hi>Carliſle;</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was it juſt in the Scots to object any
thing in the caſe of Religion, ſeeing the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
are now labouring in it, being a
buſineſs which requires time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and mature
deliberation.</p>
            <p>From theſe jarrs the King hoped for ſome
advantage to himſelf; and now <hi>Oxford</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:49178:75"/>
to be blocked up by <hi>Ireton</hi> and <hi>Fleetwood,</hi>
and every day the coming of <hi>Fairfax</hi> himſelf,
and a ſtraiter Siege of that City was expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
therefore before this ſhould happen, the
King reſolved to go out of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and
communicating his mind to ſome inward
Councellors, above all other places, he pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the Scottiſh Camp; to the Scots
therefore, as they lay before <hi>Newark,</hi> the
King ſent <hi>Montruel</hi> the French Ambaſſador,
and himſelf ſoon after, as <hi>Aſhburnhams</hi> man,
with a Cloak-back behind him, eſcaped un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
out of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and came to <hi>Newark.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this enterpriſe the King was diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by ſome, who loved the ſafety of their
Country, and entreated rather to deliver
himſelf to <hi>Fairfax,</hi> which might in prohabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
put an end to the War; but the King
was obſtinate in his deſign, not doubting but
that diſſentions daily growing between the
two Nations, he ſhould be the more welcome
to the Scots, ſafe from harm, and be able by
this means either to make a peace upon his
own conditions, or kindle a new war.</p>
            <p>The King came firſt to <hi>Montruels</hi> houſe,
and from thence to <hi>Southwell,</hi> into the Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh
Camp; the beſieged <hi>Newarkers</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of the Kings coming, and being
brought into great ſtraits, harkned to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:49178:75"/>
and ſurrendred the Town.</p>
            <p>The Scots ſeemed to be amazed at the
Kings unexpected coming to them, and ſo
ſignified the matter to the Engliſh Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners,
then preſent with them upon the
place. Letters were immediately written of it
to <hi>London,</hi> and to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> the Engliſh
Parliament required the Scots to detain the
King at <hi>Southwell,</hi> but they, contrary to that
Order, carried him away to <hi>Kelham,</hi> where a
greater part of their Army lay, and ſoon after,
without expecting any further Orders from
the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> removed their
Camp, marched Northward, and carried
away the King with them to <hi>Newcaſtle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Scots excuſed their departure, becauſe
<hi>Newark</hi> being yeilded, no work was left for
them, but alleadged, <hi>That as the King came to
them of his own accord, unexpected, ſo he followed
their Army, neither being entreated, nor fobidden
by them:</hi> but they ſeemed to haſten their
departure, by reaſon of a rumor (whether
true or falſly pretended) that <hi>Cromwell</hi> with
all his Horſe was marching toward them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Engliſh upon this, complained
much both againſt the Scots and the King;
To the Scots they objected the</hi> breach of
Covenant and Treaty; <hi>To the King they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
it</hi> As a great obſtinacy and deſpight to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:49178:76"/>
the Engliſh Nation, whom he had ſo long
injured, that now in his low ebb, he ſhould in
<hi>England,</hi> leaving the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi>
go to the Scots, their Mercenaries: if he deſired
peace, why did he not embrace it, being offered
upon ſuch conditions, as beſides his neceſſities, the
common ſafety of his People invited him to? ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than go about to kindle new fire between the
two confederate Nations.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> General <hi>Fairfax</hi>
with his whole Army came within ſight of
<hi>Oxford,</hi> and diſpoſing his quarters round
about the City, ſummoned the Governour
<hi>Glenham</hi> to ſurrender it; <hi>Glenham</hi> anſwered,
that he would firſt ſend to the King, and
when he knew his mind, would do what was
fitting; this anſwer was not allowed. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
<hi>Fairfax</hi> conſidering with himſelf
(which was alſo the opinion of all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders)
that it was likely to prove a long
Siege, being a City excellent well fortified,
and a ſtrong Garriſon in it, conſiſting of at
leaſt five thouſand, moſt of them old ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
ſtored with proviſions, arms, and ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
for a great while, yet was put into
hope of ſooner obtaining it, by intelligence
which he had gotten out of Letters, and by
ſome Spies, that within they were much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
in their opinions; and the greater part
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:49178:76"/>
eſpecially thoſe of the Nobility) deſired it
ſhould be ſurrendred, that they might have,
while time was, honorable conditions.
Therefore they began to Treat, and not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
between the Army and the City, but in
Parliament at <hi>London</hi> it was debated, and at
laſt decreed, That the beſieged ſhould rather
have the beſt conditions, than that their
precious Army ſhould be conſumed before
ſo ſtrong a place, whilſt in the mean time ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things might fall out ill to the Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>But the chief reaſon of granting ſuch large
conditions was, that the conquering Army, it
being now Mid-ſummer, might be tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into <hi>Ireland,</hi> to vindicate that afflicted
Country againſt the barbarous and bloudy
Rebels, but that ſo pious an intention of the
Parliament was quite fruſtrated by the Kings
going to the Scots, of whom at that time
there were ſome jealouſies, and that the
King went to the Scots for that very purpoſe,
it was believed by Letters (which were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
afterward) written to <hi>Ormund,</hi> before
he went out of <hi>Oxford, We hope that this deſign
of ours, though it may ſeem dangerous to our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
will prove advantagious for</hi> Ireland, <hi>in
hindering the Rebels</hi> (meaning the Parliament)
<hi>from tranſporting any forces into that Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:49178:77"/>
Thus <hi>Oxford</hi> was ſurrendred; and at the
appointed day all the ſouldiers of that Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
marched away by <hi>Fairfax</hi> his Army,
with great quiet and modeſty on both ſides.
The Duke of <hi>York</hi> was honorably conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to <hi>London,</hi> where two of the Kings children
remained; thither alſo went all the Noble
men, nor was it denied to any of the Beſieged
to go to <hi>London:</hi> but the Princes, <hi>Rupert</hi> and
<hi>Maurice,</hi> being commanded to go out of
<hi>England,</hi> prepared for their departure.</p>
            <p>The great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> with other
Enſigns of Majeſty, were layed up in the
Library, which afterward carried to <hi>London,</hi>
was by the command of Parliament (for the
Parliament, when the great Seal three years
before was carried away to the King, had
made a new one) broken in pieces, together
with the other ſmaller Seals.</p>
            <p>Prince <hi>Charles</hi> about that time, diſtruſting
the condition of his ſide, fled from <hi>Silly,</hi> with
a few of his inward Counſellors, and went to
<hi>Jerſey,</hi> that from thence he might paſs into
<hi>France</hi> to the Queen his Mother. While the
Prince remained in <hi>Jerſey,</hi> the Commiſſioners
both of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> intreated the
King that the Prince his Son might continue
within his Dominions, leſt if he ſhould go into
<hi>France,</hi> it might be inconvenient at this time,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:49178:77"/>
and an obſtruction to the deſired peace; but
the King promiſing them that he would think

            <p>This Letter was intercepted going from
<hi>Newcaſtte</hi> to <hi>Jerſey</hi> in a ſmall Veſſel, and read
in Parliament, to their great grief.</p>
            <p>Soon after the ſurrender of <hi>Oxford,</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the end of this fierce War, for <hi>Worce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
Wallingford, Pendennis,</hi> and <hi>Ragland,</hi> yeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
alſo to the Conquerors. Peace now
ſeemed to be reſtored to <hi>England,</hi> but they
had no ſecurity; for the Parliament (having
vanquiſhed the common Enemy) were grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly
troubled with Factions among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and divided under the unhappy names
of <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independents;</hi> nor was
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:49178:78"/>
it onely in thoſe things which concerned
Church-government, but in the tranſaction
of almoſt all other buſineſſes, they debate
fiercely, and were divided in their Votes.</p>
            <p>The ſame difference (namely of <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
and <hi>Independent)</hi> troubled not onely the
Parliament Houſe, but the City, the Country,
and ſome of the Camps, ſeeming a thing that
threatned danger; and the Parliament feared
that <hi>Maſſey</hi>'s forces (which had deſerved
very well of the Common-wealth) being
quartered about the <hi>Devizes,</hi> might under
that name make a Mutiny: wherefore Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<hi>Fairfax</hi> was ſent from <hi>Oxford</hi> into the
Weſt to disband (the War being ended)
thoſe forces of <hi>Maſſey,</hi> being two thouſand
five hundred horſe, which thing was quietly
done within eight dayes, and all thoſe Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
with ready obedience left their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
although they were not fully paid at
that time; for which <hi>Maſſey</hi> (as for other
things) was much commended in being
careful, by adviſing his ſouldiers, that this
buſineſs without any difficulty ſhould be ſo
ended.</p>
            <p>The War being now quite finiſhed, <hi>Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax,</hi>
the Victorious Preſerver of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Parliament, returned to <hi>London,</hi> about the
midſt of <hi>November.</hi> All good men longed to
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:49178:78"/>
ſee that great Souldier, whom they could not
but admire, by whoſe valour they were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
from the worſt of evils, and were now
in expectation of an happy peace.</p>
            <p>The next day after he came to <hi>London;</hi>
That he might ſee the gratitude of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Houſe of Peers ſent their Speaker,
<hi>Mancheſter,</hi> whom the Earls of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Pembrook,</hi> and many other Nobles ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied;
who congratulated his return,
and gave him great thanks for his moſt
faithful and happy ſervices to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When the Lords were gone,</hi> Lenthal, <hi>the
Speaker of the Houſe of Commons with al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
300. Members of that Houſe, came to
congratulate the General, to whom</hi> Lenthal
<hi>made a ſpeech, wherein he diſcourſed of the
greatneſs of his actions, extolling them by
examples of the moſt great and famous</hi> Heroes
<hi>of ancient times.</hi> You <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> noble General
ſhall all poſterity admire and honour, and the
people of <hi>England,</hi> ſince they can give you no
thanks equal to your merits, do freely confeſs
themſelves for ever indebted to you, as the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
inſtrument of God, and finiſher of our Wars
with incredible ſuceeſs: <hi>To which the modeſt</hi>
Fairfax <hi>made a ſhort reply,</hi> Acknowledging
himſelf unworthy of ſo great an honour, and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:49178:79"/>
giving moſt humble thanks to the Parliament,
accounting it his greateſt happineſs in this world
to be made by God inſtrumental for the good of
his Country.</p>
            <p>But the General ſtaid not long at <hi>London,</hi>
being preſently after ſent to carry the money
for the Scots into the North; of which we
ſhall ſpeak afterwards; in the mean time we
will return to the King, and Scots.</p>
            <p>On the ſixth of <hi>May,</hi> 1646. long before
the ſurrender of <hi>Oxford;</hi> when the Parliament
of <hi>England</hi> underſtood that the King was
with the Scots, when the Scots alſo had diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed
their Orders; which were, <hi>That they
ſhould detain the King at</hi> Southwel, <hi>and that</hi>
Aſhburnham, <hi>with the reſt of his followers,
ſhould be ſent to</hi> London, (of which the Scots
obeyed neither, letting <hi>Aſhburnham</hi> and the
reſt eſcape, and carrying the King into the
North) the Parliament, after a long debate
of both Houſes, at laſt Voted, <hi>That the perſon
of the King ſhould be diſpoſed of by the authority
of both Houſes of the Parliament of</hi> England.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Scots</hi> excuſing themſelves, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
to deliver up the King, a great diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hapned between the two Nations, which
did much animate the Royaliſts, and ſeemed
dangerous to the two Kingdoms. Many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
were made upon this occaſion, and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:49178:79"/>
many ſharp invective Writings on both ſides
for the ſpace of divers moneths.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Scots alleaged, that he was no leſs
King of</hi> Scotland <hi>than of</hi> England; <hi>and that
therefore their Kingdom had ſome right to
the diſpoſing of him; the Engliſh affirmed,
that his perſon was to be diſpoſed by the
authority of that Kingdom in which he then
was; but that they ſet forth, as a very ſtrange
thing</hi> that a Scottiſh Army, paid by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
of <hi>England,</hi> and which by the Compact
of both Kingdoms, was to be governed by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
of both Kingdoms upon the place,
ſhould notwithſtanding receive the King of
<hi>England,</hi> without the conſent or knowledge of
the Engliſh Commiſſioners, and carry him away
to <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> a Town of <hi>England,</hi> and there
keep him without the conſent of the Parliament
of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the midſt of theſe great diſſentions:
which notwithſtanding the prudence of ſome
men did ſo well moderate (whileſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
enemy and factious ſpirits ſought to
aggravate them) that they proved not perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
to the Kingdoms, the main buſineſs, and
things neceſſary for the <hi>Common good</hi> were
unanimouſly and friendly tranſacted by the
two Nations: and among other things, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the ſending of propoſitions to the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:49178:80"/>
King <hi>for a firm and well grounded peace,</hi> it was
debated, and at laſt agreed, that nineteen
Propoſitions (ſo many therewere) ſhould
be ſent to <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> to the King; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are long, and fully recited in a
larger Hiſtory, I will not relate in this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome.</p>
            <p>Theſe Propoſitions were ſent away to the
King upon the fifteenth day of <hi>July</hi> one
thouſand ſix hundred forty ſix, and preſented
to his hands at <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> by the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of both Houſes of Parliament, namely,
the Earl of <hi>Pembrooke,</hi> Earl of <hi>Denbigh,</hi> and
the Lord <hi>Mountague</hi> of the Peers; and ſix of
the Houſe of Commons; the Commiſſioners
of the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> being preſent,
and conſenting to them.</p>
            <p>And that the King might conceive himſelf

            <p>The Lords and Commons, Commiſſioners
of the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> ſtaid long with
the King at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> humbly entreating
him, that he would vouchſafe to ſign and
eſtabliſh thoſe propoſitions being not much
higher than thoſe, which had been offered to
his Majeſty at <hi>Vxbridge,</hi> when the chance of
War was yet doubtful; the ſame thing did
the Commiſſioners of the Parliament in
<hi>Scotland</hi> humbly entreat; and the like did
others daily, who came with renewed ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
to that end from the Parliament ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
at <hi>Edenburgh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in vain were the ſupplications of both
Kingdoms; the King perſiſted obſtinately
in denial of his Aſſent; but daily he ſeemed
to take exceptions at ſome particulars,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:49178:81"/>
whereby time was delayed for ſome moneths,
and the affairs of both Kingdoms much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded,
which happened at an unſeaſonable
time, when not onely the diſſentions between
the two Nations about Garriſons, mony, and
other things were juſtly feared, but alſo in
the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> and City of
<hi>London,</hi> the factions then encreaſing between
the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independents,</hi> from
whence the common enemy began to ſwell
with hopes not improbable, and this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
was the cauſe of the Kings delay.</p>
            <p>But thoſe hopes of the enemy ſoon vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and this very averſneſs of the King did in
ſome meaſure compoſe the diſſentions of the
Parliament; inſomuch as they began
unanimouſly to conſult, how they might ſettle
the affairs of both Kingdoms (ſince it could
not otherwiſe be) without the King; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was debated in the Parliament of
<hi>England,</hi> to pay the Scots for their aſſiſtance
in this War, and at laſt agreed that the Scots
ſhould receive four hundred thouſand
pounds; half of that ſum, namely, two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thouſand pounds was to be paid in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
upon receipt of which, the Scots were
to deliver up <hi>Berwick, Carliſle,</hi> and <hi>Newca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi>
to the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> according
to the compact. It was alſo debated, though
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:49178:81"/>
with much time and difficulty, where the
Kings perſon ſhould be diſpoſed, in caſe he
did abſolutely and utterly deny his Aſſent to
the Propoſitions; at which meeting it was
freely granted by the Parliament to the Scots,
that they might carry the King (if they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed)
to <hi>Edenburgh;</hi> but that the Scots refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
affirming, that by his preſence in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetled
Kingdom, new commotions might
ariſe; they rather deſired (which was alſo
the Kings deſire) that he might be carried
into the Southern parts of <hi>England,</hi> and live
in ſome of his Palaces neer <hi>London,</hi> which
they thought more convenient for treating
of a peace, as if <hi>England</hi> were not in the ſame
danger by his preſence. So that in all that
whole debate they ſeemed to contend, not
who ſhould have the King, but who ſhould
not have him.</p>
            <p>Whileſt theſe things were tranſacting, and
the King daily was humbly entreated by both
Kingdoms to grant his Aſſent to theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
the Earl of <hi>London,</hi> Chancellour of
Scotland, about the end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> when the
Commiſſioners of both Kingdoms were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
made an Oration to the King, which

            <p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:49178:82"/>
YOur Majeſty was pleaſed on <hi>Monday</hi> laſt
to call the Commiſſioners of the Parliament
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and imparting the Propoſitions to
them, to promiſe that you would likewiſe impart
your Anſwer before you ſent it; but ſo ſhort is
the Commiſſioners prefixed time, and of ſo great
moment (either to the ſafety or ruine of your
Crown and Kingdoms) is your Majeſties An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
that we ſhould be wanting both to God, and
our own truſt, if we ſhould not repreſent to your
Majeſty how neceſſary it is (in this conjuncture
of time) That you grant your aſſent to theſe
Propoſitions; and what an incurable malady,
and ſudden ruine muſt needs follow upon your
denial. I ſhall begin with the diſeaſe, and ſpeak
after of the remedy: The differences betwixt
your Majeſty and Parliament (known better to
no man than your ſelf) are at this time ſo high,
that (after ſo many bloudy Battels) no compoſure
can be made, nor a more certain ruine avoided,
without a preſent pacification. The Parliament
are in poſſeſſion of your Navy, of all the Towns,
Caſtles and Forts of <hi>England;</hi> they enjoy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
Sequeſtrations, your Revenue. Souldiers
and monies are raiſed by their Authority, and
after ſo many Victories and Succeſſes, they have
a ſtanding ſtrong Army, who, for their ſtrength,
are able to act any thing in Church or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
at their own pleaſure. Beſides there are
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:49178:82"/>
ſome ſo fearful, others ſo unwilling to ſumit to
your Majeſty, that they deſire neither your ſelf,
nor any of your Iſſue to raign over them. The
People weary of War, and groaning under taxes,
though they deſire Peace, yet are ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the pulling down of Monarchy (under
which they have long flouriſhed) that they
which are weary of your Government, dare not
go about to throw it off, untill they have (once
at leaſt) offered Propoſition of Peace to your
Majeſty, leſt the Vulgar (without whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
they cannot perfect the Work) ſhould
fall from them. Therefore when the whole
People, weary of War, deſire ſecurity from preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
and arbitrary rule: the moſt Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Houſes of Parliament have conſented to
offer theſe Propoſitions to your Majeſty with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which the greater part of the people do ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the Kingdom can neither enjoy Peace nor
Safety; therefore your Majeſties friends, and
the Commiſſioners of <hi>Scotland,</hi> though not
without ſome reluctation, were forced to conſent
to the ſending of theſe Propoſitions (for elſe
none had been ſent) or elſe incur the publick
hatred, as enemies to peace. Now Sir if your
Majeſty (which God forbid) ſhould deny to ſign
theſe Propoſitions, you would looſe all your
friends, both City and Country; and all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
as one man would riſe up againſt you; it
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:49178:83"/>
may then be feared (all hope of reconciliation
being taken away) that they may cite you, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
you, and ſet up another Government.
Moreover they will require of us to deliver
your Majeſty to them to reſtore their Garriſon
Towns, and carry our Army out of <hi>England.</hi>
Laſtly, if your Majeſty perſiſt in denying, both
Kingdoms will be compelled to agree together
for their mutual ſafety, to ſettle Religion and
peace without you, which (to our unſpeakable
grief) would ruine your Majeſty, and your Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity.
But if your Majeſty ſhall deſpiſe the
councel of us (who wiſh nothing more upon earth
than the eſtabliſhing of your Majeſties Throne)
and by obſtinacy looſe <hi>England,</hi> your Majeſty
will not be ſuffered to enter <hi>Scotland,</hi> and ruine
that, Sir, We have laid our hands upon our
hearts, we have prayed to God to direct us, and
have ſeriouſly conſidered of the remedy for theſe
miſchiefs, but we can find nothing elſe (as the
caſe now ſtands) which can preſerve your
Crown and Kingdoms, then that your Majeſty
ſhould ſign theſe Propoſitions; in ſome things
(we confeſs) they are higher than we (if our
wiſh might have gone) would have made them;
but ſeeing that no other way is left to cure the
Kingdoms wounds, and conſolidate the ruptures
between your Majeſty and the Parliament:
We do in all humility and loyalty adviſe your
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:49178:83"/>
Majeſty, that out of your gratious goodneſs, you
would aſſent to them, as being the onely remedy
left to procure a firm and happy peace, from
whence alſo many happineſſes will accrue to you,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>But neither this Oration of <hi>Londen,</hi> nor all
the endeavours of both Parliaments could
after the Kings mind; yet did not the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
give over their hopes, but perſiſted
in intreating; ſo that many moneths were
ſpent in this buſineſs, and the time conſumed
till the midſt of Winter, in which ſpace they
could not perſwade the King to hear any
Miniſters of the Synod preach before him,
being conſtant onely to his own Chaplains.</p>
            <p>Upon which they began to endeavour that
amity might be preſerved between the two
Nations, and that the two Kingdoms (things
ſtanding as they did) might be peaceably
ſetled without the King.</p>
            <p>Therefore after ſome debate between the
Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> and the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> they at the laſt agreed upon
the aforeſaid ſum, namely that two hundred
thouſand pounds ſhould be forthwith paid
to the Scots; which mony being told out,
was by General <hi>Fairfax,</hi> with part of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
conveyed out of <hi>London,</hi> who afterwards
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:49178:84"/>
committed the buſineſs to Major General
<hi>Skippon.</hi> He with ſix Regiments marched
away in the midſt of Winter, and in <hi>January</hi>
came to <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> upon <hi>Tine</hi> with the mony.</p>
            <p>The Scots, when they had received their
mony, according to the compact, delivered up
the Engliſh Garriſons, <hi>Berwick, Carliſle,</hi> and
<hi>Newcaſtle</hi> into the Parliaments hands, and
marched quietly home into <hi>Scotland;</hi> they
delivered alſo the King to the Engliſh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners

ſecurity could not be ſuddenly obtained

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:49178:84"/>
diſſention more than Civil aroſe among the
Conquerors, which ſeemed therefore more
ſad to all good men, becauſe it was between
thoſe, who before had with moſt united af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
and deſires, thrown their lives and
Fortunes into the hazard againſt a common
Enemy, whom the ſame cauſe, the ſame fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of reforming Religion, and reſtoring
liberty, and the ſame prayers had linked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in the neareſt bond of conſcience.</p>
            <p>By this diviſion, under the names of <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian</hi>
and <hi>Independent,</hi> ſtill encreaſing, the
minds of men began beyond all meaſure to
be embittered againſt each other; one ſide
complained, that the Covenant was broken;
the other, that it was not rightly enterpreted
by them, nor ſo, as that it could any way be a
vindication of the cauſe undertaken, or the
publike Safety; on both ſides were men of
great reputation.</p>
            <p>Yet did they not at firſt ſo far diſſent, but
that both ſides ſeemed forward to vindicate
the Common cauſe againſt the Kings party,
called Malignants. It muſt be a longer time,
that muſt by degrees ſo far work upon the
conſciences of that ſide, which ſeemed weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
as to make them cleave to the Malignants
for a prop. The Malignants were ready to
joyn with either ſide, that they might ruine
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:49178:85"/>
both. They themſelves (though diſarmed)
being now the greateſt number<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eſpecially by

of Taxations. A great number of the Citizens
of <hi>London,</hi> not of the mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>eſt, but higheſt rank,
had revolted from their former principles;
inſomuch as that City (all the Kings Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
being by <hi>Fairfax</hi> his bloudleſs Victories
emptied thither) became to be of that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as that the Parliament, without the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
help, could not ſafely ſit there. Theſe
diſſentions of <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Independent</hi>
(becauſe the motives and intentions of men
are not enough known) our purpoſe is to
touch with more brevity than the actions of
open War, and plain hoſtility, though they
alſo are here ſhortly mentioned.</p>
            <p>It were a work of too much length and
difficulty, to recite how many Calumnies
were raiſed by the other faction againſt the
Army (before ſo much admired) as maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the Independent faction. How divers
Petitions were drawn up, and ſub-ſcriptions
eagerly ſought in the County of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> againſt
this Army, which was then quartered about
<hi>Walden,</hi> in the moneth of <hi>April.</hi> And in the
Parliament it ſelf it was ſo far, and in that
manner debated concerning disbanding of
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:49178:85"/>
that Army; that they (being now taught to
value their own merits) conceived themſelves
much injured; and in the moneth of <hi>May</hi>
preſented a Petition to their General. In
which they deſire to be ſatisfied, not onely
for their due pay, as Souldiers, but in things
concerning (belonging to them as free born
ſons of the Nation) the publike liberties,
which they had fought for. Of which Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
great complaint was made by thoſe of the
other Faction. Theſe and ſome other Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
wrought at laſt ſo far, as that the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
about the beginning of <hi>June</hi> (upon what
deſign, or what jealouſies I leave to Judge)
took away the King from <hi>Helmby,</hi> out of the
Parliament-Commiſſioners hands, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
him along with them in the Army. So
that his perſon was to be in ſome Town, or
Palace neer to their Quarter. When this was
known, it was ordered by both Houſes of
Parliament (and their order ſent to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.)</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That the King ſhould reſide at <hi>Richmond.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. That he ſhould be attended by the ſame
perſons that he was at <hi>Holmby.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. That <hi>Roſſiters</hi> Regiment ſhould guard
him.</item>
            </list>
            <p>But the next day from the General, and
his Councel of Officers, was brought to the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49178:86"/>
Parliament an Impeachment againſt eleven
Members of the Houſe of Commons, <hi>viz.</hi>
(honoured names many of them) <hi>Hollis,
Stapleton, Waller, Glyn, Maſſey, Maynard,
Lewis, Clotworthy, Long, Harley,</hi> and <hi>Nichols.</hi>
Wherein divers things were objected con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
hindering the Releif of <hi>Ireland,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing
Juſtice, and acting ſomewhat
againſt the Army, and the Laws of <hi>England.</hi>
The Impeached Members declared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ready to anſwer to any crime that
could be objected againſt them. But another
requeſt came from the Army, that thoſe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached
Members, untill they had brought in
their anſwer, might be ſecluded from their
Seats in Parliament. This at the firſt was not
granted, as a thing judged to be too high,
and too much againſt the priviledge of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.
But when the Army iterated their
deſire, thoſe accuſed Members, by leave of
the Parliament, made a voluntary Seceſſion
for ſix moneths. Concerning that Order of
Parliament, that the King ſhould go to <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>
the General deſired to be excuſed; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating
them not to command that; untill
things were more quiet, and that they would
appoint no Reſidence for the King nearer to
<hi>London,</hi> than they would allow the Quarter
of the Army to be. After which the King was
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:49178:86"/>
conveied to <hi>Roiſton,</hi> thence to <hi>Hatfield,</hi> no
long after to <hi>Cauſum,</hi> while the Army quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
at <hi>Reading.</hi> From whence, when the
General with his Army marched to <hi>Bedford,</hi>
the King went to the Earl of <hi>Bedfords</hi> Houſe
neer <hi>Ouborn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About that time was rumoured a very
dangerous conſpiracy in <hi>London,</hi> of Citizens,
Apprentices, and others againſt the Army,
namely, that many Citizens, and Apprentices,
and other people had privately liſted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to make a Force againſt the Army. The
General hearing this, certified the Cities
Commiſſioners, who were then with him at
the Head-quarters of it. Who made haſt to
<hi>London,</hi> to examine and quiet thoſe troubles;
but at that time between the two embittered
Factions, nothing but ſuſpitions and tumults
could be. Theſe Jealouſies daily encreaſing,
on <hi>July</hi> 22. the Parliament made an Order to
change that <hi>Militia</hi> of the City, which had
been eſtabliſhed upon the fourth of <hi>May,</hi> and
put others, which were better affected to the
Army, in their rooms. Upon which Order, the
Citizens of that faction were wonderfully
incenſed, and petitioned the Houſe on the
twenty ſix of <hi>July,</hi> which being read, ſeemed
rather a command than a petition. This was
carried, and followed by a diſſolute multitude
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:49178:87"/>
of Citizens, Apprentiſes, and other unruly
perſons, who preſſed to the very doors of the
Parliament, and cried out in a threatning
way, that before the Houſe riſe, they muſt
order according to their Petition; and ſo far
did their violence prevail, that they extorted
an Order for the re-eſtabliſhing of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<hi>Militia.</hi> But not content with that,
when the Houſe was riſing, they took the
Speaker, and rudely thruſt him again into his
chair, detaining both him, and the reſt of the
Members there, (an unheard of violation
of Parliament!) until they enforced from
them another Order, which was, <hi>That the
King ſhould come to</hi> London.</p>
            <p>After this rude violation, the Houſes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed
until <hi>Fryday</hi> next, which was the
thirtieth of <hi>July.</hi> Upon which day, both the
Speakers being abſent, (for they with the
greateſt part of the Members had left <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
and withdrawn themſelves to the Army)
new Speakers were choſen, the Lord <hi>Hunſdon</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Henry Pelham</hi> a Barreſter, by whom
Orders were made that day:
<list>
                  <item>1. That the King ſhould come to <hi>London.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. That the Militia of <hi>London</hi> ſhould be
authorized to raiſe Forces for defence of the City.</item>
                  <item>3. Power was given to the ſame Militia to
chooſe a General for thoſe Forces.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:49178:87"/>
It was likewiſe Ordered, that the aforeſaid
eleven Members, Impeached by the Army,
ſhould return to their ſeats in Parliament.</p>
            <p>The Citizens armed with theſe Orders, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
proceed to raiſing of Forces, of which
they Elected <hi>Maſſey</hi> to be their General.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the mean time the Lords and Commons,
who had left</hi> London, <hi>conſulting with the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
and chief Commanders of the Army,
made an Order,</hi> That all Acts and Decrees,
that had paſſed on the 26. of <hi>July,</hi> and ſince,
ſhould be accounted null and void, and that
they did adhere to the Declaration of the General
and Councel of the Army. It was likewiſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed,
that the General with his Army ſhould
march to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when the Citizens heard of the Armies
approach, their ſtomacks being ſomewhat
abated, and their opinions ſo much divided
in Common-Councel, that it appeared im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for them ſuddenly to raiſe any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to oppoſe the Army; they ſent to the
General for a Pacification, which (by the
conſent of the Members of parliament then
with him) was granted to them upon theſe
conditions:
<list>
                  <item>1. That they ſhould deſert the Parliament
now ſitting, and the Eleven Impeached Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="170" facs="tcp:49178:88"/>
2. That they ſhould recall their Declaration
lately divulged.</item>
                  <item>3. They ſhould relinquiſh their preſent Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia.</item>
                  <item>4. They ſhould deliver up to the General all
their Forts, and the Tower of <hi>London.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>5. They ſhould disband all the Forces they
had raiſed.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>And do all things elſe which were neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
for the publick tranquillity. All which
things none of them daring to deny, were
preſently ratified.</p>
            <p>On the ſixt day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the General with
his Army came to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and with him
the Speakers of both Houſes, together with
the reſt of the Lords and Commons, whom
he reſtored all to their former Seats. Both
the Speakers, in the name of the whole Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament,
gave thanks to the General; they
made him Commander of all the Forces in
<hi>England,</hi> and in <hi>Wales,</hi> and Conſtable of the
Tower of <hi>London;</hi> a moneths pay was likewiſe
given as a gratuity to the Army. The next
day General <hi>Fairfax,</hi> Lieutenant General
<hi>Cromwel,</hi> Major General <hi>Skippon,</hi> and the reſt
of the Commanders, with the whole Army,
marched through <hi>London,</hi> from the Weſtern
part thereof to the Tower, where ſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
were changed, and the <hi>Militia</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:49178:88"/>
ſetled. Then leaſt the City ſhould ſwell
with too much power, her <hi>Militia</hi> by Order
of Parliament was divided, and Authority
given to <hi>Weſtminſter, Southwark,</hi> and the
<hi>Hamblets</hi> about the Tower, to exerciſe and
command their own <hi>Militiaes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus was the <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> faction depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;
and the Parliament thus reſtored, were
very intent upon the buſineſs of annulling
all thoſe Acts, which in their abſence, and by
that tumultuous violence had been made, and
in puniſhing the Authors of thoſe Seditions.</p>

about the middle of <hi>Auguſt</hi> was brought to

            </p>
            <p>While the King remained at <hi>Hampton

But a Prince living in the ſplendor of a Court,
ſo freely to his preſence were all ſorts of
people admitted, to kiſs his hands, and do all
obeyſances whatſoever. None were forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

from <hi>London</hi> onely, and the adjacent Towns
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:49178:89"/>
reſort to the King, but his Servants alſo from

Delinquents, ſuch as <hi>Aſhburnham, Bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi>
and the reſt, who now by the permiſſion

upon what reaſons, or deſign this permiſſion
was, many wondred.</p>
            <p>Stirred up by theſe examples (if not ſent
for by the King) the Lords formerly of his

Marqueſs <hi>Hartford,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Southampton</hi>

to conſult and give their advice to him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Propoſitions of Parliament, or
other buſineſs. The Parliament were diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
at this thing; neither would the Army
long ſuffer it, conſidering that the King had
not yet in any thing at all given ſatisfaction
to the Parliament. Whereupon thoſe Lords
being told of it, after two daies ſtay at <hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
Court,</hi> returned to their own houſes.</p>
            <p>On the ſeventh day of <hi>September,</hi> Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
agreed upon by both Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(the Commiſſioners of the Kingdom of
<hi>Scotland</hi> concurring alſo) were ſent to the
King at <hi>Hampton Court.</hi> To which they did
humbly beſeech his Majeſty, that he would
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:49178:90"/>
give his anſwer within ſix dayes. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
appointed for this buſineſs, of the

Lord <hi>Mountague,</hi> Sir <hi>James Harring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>

the Earl of <hi>Louderdale,</hi> &amp; Sir <hi>Charls Erskins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King, although he denied (as before)
to grant the Propoſitions, wrote notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
an Anſwer to the Parliament, in
which he ſayes, That to ſome things he can
aſſent, namely, about eſtabliſhing Presbytery
for 3 years, about granting the <hi>Militia,</hi> as it
was before offered to him. But in the other
things he muſt altogether diſſent. He affirms,
that he could rather hearken to the Propoſals
of the Army, (for the Army had lately pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
ſome propoſals, in the manner of the
Parliament Propoſitions, about ſetling the
peace of the Kingdom) and deſired the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
that they would conſider of thoſe
Propoſals,</p>
            <p>The Parliament, not yet deterred by theſe
often denials of the King, fell upon debate
about making Propoſitions to him again.
When the Commiſſioners of <hi>Scotland</hi> reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
at <hi>London</hi> (after that <hi>Louden</hi> and <hi>Lane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi>
who came newly out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> had
talked privately with the King at <hi>Hampton
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:49178:90"/>
Court)</hi> ſent Letters to the Parliament, in which
they require that the King may come to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
and then perſonally treat with the parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament
about the things controverted; thoſe
very Scots, who not long before, both in their
Orations and Letters, <hi>Denied it to be juſt, or
convenient for the Common-wealth, that the
King, before he had given ſatisfaction and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to the People, ſhould be admitted to</hi> London;
<hi>or to any Perſonal Treaty with the Parliament.</hi>
Thoſe very Scots, who denyed to receive the
King into <hi>Scotland,</hi> for fear he might raiſe
commotions in their Country, would now
have him brought to <hi>London,</hi> a City filled with
Malignants, and fit for any Tumults, in which
the Parliament it ſelf, without the guard of
an Army, could not ſafely ſit. That which
moved them to this demand (as they alleag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
was becauſe the King had been taken
from <hi>Holmby</hi> againſt his will, and without the
conſent of Parliament, by the violence of
Souldiers, and ſtill remained under the power
of an Army, not in that freedom, which was
thought fit for a King, treating about a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of ſo great moment.</p>
            <p>At the end of their Epiſtle they ſeem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
that he may ſtay (if <hi>London</hi> be denied) at
<hi>Hampton Court,</hi> ſo he be not under the power
of the Army, but in ſuch a condition, as that
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:49178:91"/>
the Commiſſioners of both Parliaments may
have a free recourſe to him. But the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were again framing Propoſitions (with
ſome alterations) to be ſent to the King, when
lo, on a ſudden they were ſtrucken with an
unexpected Meſſage, That the King was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily
fled out of <hi>Hampton Court:</hi> To which
purpoſe Letters came about midnight from
<hi>Cromwel</hi> to the Speaker. For on the twelfth
day of <hi>November,</hi> whileſt the Commiſſioners
of Parliament, and Colonel <hi>Whaley,</hi> who
commanded the Guard, expected when the
King ſhould come out of his Chamber to Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and wondered at his long ſtay; at laſt
about nine of the clock, ſome of them going
in, and not finding the King, they found his
cloak left there, and a letter written with his
own hand to the Commiſſioners, to be by
them communicated to both Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
in which letter, after he had diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
ſomewhat about captivity, and the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of liberty, he proteſted, as before God,
that he had not taken this deſign of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
himſelf, to diſturb the publike peace,
or any treaty tending to the eſtabliſhment
thereof: but onely to preſerve his own ſafety,
againſt which he underſtood there was a
treaſonable Conſpiracy. But toward the
end of his Letter, he uſeth theſe words;</p>

Now as I cannot deny, but that my perſonal
ſecurity is the urgent cauſe of this my retirement:
ſo I take God to witneſs, that the publick Peace is

The Army (for the reſt, though neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,

(in my judgement) to enjoy the Liberty of their

Indempnity (which ſhould extend to the reſt of all
my Subjects) and that all their Arrears ſhould be
ſpeedily and duly paid; which I will undertake to
do, ſo I may be heard, and that I be not hindred

troubled with this unexpected news of the

peace ſhould thereby be diſturbed, they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
that men of fidelity ſhould be ſpeedily
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:49178:92"/>
ſent to all the Sea-ports, leſt the King ſhould
paſs into any Forreign Country. And when
tidings (though falſe) were brought unto them,
that the King was concealed within the City
of <hi>London,</hi> they ordered, <hi>That if any man ſhould
cloſely detain the King's Perſon, and not reveal it
to the Parliament, he ſhould be puniſhed with the
loſs of his eſtate and life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Cloud ſoon diſſolved, and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were informed by Col. <hi>Hammond</hi> (who
was newly by conſent of both Houſes, made
Governor of the Iſle of <hi>Wight)</hi> that the King
was come into that Iſland, and had delivered
himſelf into his protection. <hi>Hammond</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
himſelf to be ready to obey the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-commands
in all things. The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
commending <hi>Hammond,</hi> did alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
him with all diligence to guard the
King; but to wait upon him with all reſpect
and honour; promiſing, that they would take
care that proviſions of every kinde ſhould not
be wanting, nor money to defray the King's
expences.</p>
            <p>While the Parliament were again delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
about Propoſitions to be ſent to the
King in the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> a Letter of great
length from the King, ſuperſcribed, To the
Speaker of the Lords Houſe, to be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
alſo to the Houſe of Commons, was
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:49178:92"/>
read upon the eighteenth day of <hi>November.</hi>
In which he delivered his Senſe and Opinion
concerning many things contained in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Propoſitions, eſpecially concerning the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolition
of Epiſcopacy; he diſputed out of the
dictates of his conſcience much, and gave
touches alſo of the other matters. Of all
which he hoped that he ſhould ſatisfie the
Parliament with his reaſons, if he might perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
treat with them. Therefore he earneſtly
deſired to be admitted with Honour, Freedom,
and Safety, to treat perſonally at <hi>London:</hi> the
Commiſſioners of <hi>Scotland,</hi> with great vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence,
alſo preſſed, that this deſire of the
King might be granted.</p>
            <p>The Parliament weighing theſe things, leſt
they ſhould betray themſelves and friends by
admitting of a perſonal Treaty with the King
in <hi>London,</hi> ſo Malignant a City, before he had
given any ſatisfaction or ſecurity, (which was
before the Scots Opinion) after ſo many miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
done to the Commonwealth, reſolved
upon a middle way.</p>
            <p>Therefore after a long debate on the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſixth of <hi>November,</hi> they concluded that four
Propoſitions, being drawn up into the form
of Acts, ſhould be ſent to the King in the Iſle
of <hi>Wight,</hi> to ſign; which when he had ſigned
he ſhould be admitted to a perſonal Treaty a
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:49178:93"/>
               <hi>London;</hi> that his Majeſty giving the Kingdom
ſecurity by paſſing theſe four Propoſitions,
there may be a perſonal Treaty with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
for paſſing the reſt of the Propoſitions.
The four were theſe.</p>
            <p>1. That a Bill be paſſed into an Act by his
Majeſty, for ſetling of the <hi>Militia</hi> of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>2. That a Bill be paſſed for his Majeſties cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in of all Declarations, Oaths, and Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
againſt the Parliament, and thoſe who have
adhered to them.</p>
            <p>3. For paſſing an Act, that thoſe Lords who
were made after the Great Seal was carried to
<hi>Oxford,</hi> may be made uncapable of ſitting in the
Houſe of Peers thereby.</p>
            <p>4. That power may be given to the two Houſes
of Parliament, to adjourn, as the two Houſes of
Parliament ſhall think fit.</p>
            <p>The Commiſſioners of <hi>Scotland</hi> would in
no wiſe give their conſent that theſe four Bills
ſhould be ſent to the King, before he treated
at <hi>London;</hi> therefore, in a very long Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they proteſted againſt it. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
that, the Bills were ſent by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
of both Houſes of Parliament, and
on the twenty fourth of <hi>December</hi> preſented
to the King at <hi>Carisbrook</hi>-Caſtle. But the
King underſtanding the minde of the Scots,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:49178:93"/>
and the factions in <hi>London,</hi> abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
to ſign thoſe Propoſitions; and the
Commiſſioners with this denial returned to
<hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the third of <hi>January</hi> the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
debated of this denial of the King:
the diſpute was ſharp, vehement, and high
about the State and Government of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth;
and many plain Speeches made
of the King's obſtinate averſneſs, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
too long patience; it was there affirmed,
that the King by this denial had denied his
protection to the people of <hi>England,</hi> for
which onely ſubjection is due from them; that
one being taken away, the other falls to the
ground. That it is very unjuſt and abſurd, that
the Parliament (having ſo often tried the
King's affections, ſhould now betray to an
implacable Enemy, both themſelves and all
thoſe friends, who in a moſt juſt cauſe had
valiantly adventured their lives and fortune:
that nothing was now left for them to do,
but to take care for the ſafety of themſelves
and their friends, and ſettle the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
(ſince otherwiſe it could not be) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the King.</p>
            <p>Therefore on the 17 of <hi>January,</hi> a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and Votes paſſed both Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
in this manner.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:49178:94"/>
The Lords and Commons aſſembled in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
after many Addreſſes to his Majesty for
the preventing and ending this unnatural War,
raiſed by him againſt the Parliament and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
having lately ſent four Bills to his Majesty,
which did contain onely matter of ſafety, and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to the Parliament and Kingdom, referring
the compoſure of other differences to a perſonal
Treaty with his Majeſty; and having received
an abſolute Negative, do hold themſelves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to uſe their utmoſt endeavours, ſpeedily to
ſettle the preſent Government in ſuch a way, as
may bring the greateſt ſecurity to this Kingdom,
in the enjoyment of the Laws and Liberties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
And in Order thereunto, and that the
Houſes may receive no delay nor interruptions
in ſo great and neceſſary a work, they have taken
theſe Reſolutions, and paſſed theſe Votes following,
<hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lords and Commons do declare, That they
will make no further Addreſſes or Applications to

            <p>Reſolved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By the Lords and Commons
aſſembled in Parliament, That no Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

            <p>Reſolved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That the Lords and Commons
do declare, That they will receive no more any
Meſſage from the King: and do enjoyn, That

either of the Houſes of Parliament, or any other
Perſon.</p>
            <p>Within few dayes after theſe Votes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
were publiſhed, a Declaration of the
General, and general Councel of the Army,
(their Head-Quarters being then at <hi>Windſor)</hi>

Fairfax, and the General Councel of
the Army, of their Reſolutions to adhere
to the Parliament in their proceedings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

                  <p>NOtwithſtanding the high violations of the
Kingdoms Rights and Liberties, and the
indeavours to ſwallow up the whole intereſt
of the Kingdom into the power and will of a
King, which the preſent King's Reign hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded;
we have obſerved, that the Parliament
was (through his neceſſities) and againſt his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
intentions to the contrary, called, but in a
condition of vindicating the Kingdom in thoſe
things, hath yet enacted with that tenderneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the King, (as to any thing of right that might
be in him, or duty towards him) as that in the
Proteſtation, Covenant, and many Declarations
publiſhed by them; that have held forth a careful
regard to the preſervation of the King's perſon, and
juſt rights, with, and in the preſervation and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
of the publick intereſts, and ſafety of the
Kingdom, and by the whole ſervice of their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and their many-fold humble Addreſſes to him,
for the preſervation and ſettlement of all, they have,
we conceive, abundantly demonſtrated the reality
and innocency of their intentious towards him: in
all which, we have ſtill underſtood the ſence and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:49178:95"/>
intention to be no other, then that the preſervation
of the King's perſon and particular rights, ſhould
be ſo endeavoured, as it might be conſiſtent with,
and not deſtructive to, thoſe great and more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
publick intereſts of Religion, and the Rights,
Liberties, and ſafety of the Kingdom; and not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe.</p>
                  <p>And accordingly, in the late Declarations and
Papers, that have occaſionally paſt from this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
as to our deſires of ſettlement to the Kingdom,
we have expreſſed our real wiſhes, that if the
King would in things neceſſary, and eſſential to
the clearing, ſetling, and ſecuring of thoſe publick
intereſts, give his concurrence to put them paſt fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
diſputes, then his Rights ſhould be conſidered
and ſetled, ſo far as might be conſiſtent with thoſe
ſuperior intereſts of the publick, and the ſecurity
thereof for future.</p>
                  <p>And that by an Addreſs to the King upon things
ſo purely eſſential to thoſe publick ends, it might
once more come to a clear trial, whether we could,
with the preſervation of the King's perſon, and in
particular intereſts, have a ſecurity to the other,
hath been our earnest deſire, our great expectation,
and our endeavour, that we and others might be
in a patient waiting for ſuch an iſſue.</p>
                  <p>Now in the Parliaments laſt Addreſſes to the
King, we finde they have inſiſted onely upon ſome
few things, ſo eſſential to that intereſt of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:49178:96"/>
which they have hitherto engaged for; as
that without betraying the ſafety of the Kingdom,
and themſelves, and all that engaged with them in
that cauſe, without denying that, which God in the
iſſue of the war, hath been ſuch a Teſtimony unto,
they could not go lower, and (thoſe things granted)
they have offered to treat for all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Thus we account that great buſineſs of a ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the Kingdom, and ſecurity to the publick
intereſt thereof, by, and with, the King's Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
to be brought unto ſo clear a trial, as that
(upon the King's denial of thoſe things) we can ſee
no further hopes of ſettlement or ſecurity that way.</p>
                  <p>And therefore underſtanding, that upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of that denial, added to ſo many other,
the Honourable Houſe of Commons, by ſeveral
Votes upon munday laſt, have reſolved not to make
any further addreſs or application to the King, nor
receive any from him, nor to ſuffer either in others;
We do freely declare for our ſelves, and the Army,
That we are reſolved, through the grace of God,
firmly to adhere with, and ſtand by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in the things voted laſt munday concerning
the King, and in what ſhall be further neceſſary
for proſecution thereof, and for ſetling and ſecuring
of the Parliament and Kingdom without the King,
and againſt him or any other that ſhall hereafter
partake with him.</p>

The Parliament alſo made a publick De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
about the beginning of <hi>February,</hi> for
ſatisfaction of all men in general, concerning
the cauſes of their Votes; in which (beſides
the Kings former miſdeeds, related before in
other Remonſtrances) they declare how often
they had treated with him, That although they
were never forced to any Treaty, yet no leſs
then ſeven times they had applied themſelves
to the King with Propoſitions, containing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what was neceſſary to the peace and
ſecurity of the Kingdom: How they had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
him Propoſitions at <hi>Oxford,</hi> afterwards
at <hi>Uxbridge,</hi> and then (after he was quite van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed
in war) at <hi>Newcaſtle;</hi> and laſtly, after
the departure of the Scots, at <hi>Hampton Court.</hi>
All which hath been perpetually denied by
him.</p>
            <p>By ſuch a Declaration did the Parliament
endeavour to appeaſe the unquiet mindes of
people: but no Arguments nor Decrees could
ſerve to aſſwage their fury, nor prevent the
ſtorms which were then ariſing. Force onely
was required, and wiſe Councel to ſearch out
conſpiracies, and ſuppreſs the Tumults which
were feared. Therefore part of the Army
was quartered about <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the <hi>Mews,</hi>
and other places of the City: And the month
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:49178:97"/>
before theſe high tranſactions, ſome Lords
and Commons were choſen out of both Houſes
to be a Committee for the ſafety of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
and ſate together at <hi>Derby</hi>-houſe,
in the ſame place where the Committee of
both Kingdoms <hi>(England</hi> and <hi>Scotland)</hi> had
ſitten before. To this Committee power was
given to ſuppreſs Tumults and Inſurrections;
and to that purpoſe, to raiſe Forces as they
ſaw occaſion.</p>
            <p>The Members of this Committee were ſeven
Lords, namely, the Earls of <hi>Northumberland,
Kent, Warwick</hi> and <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> the-Lords <hi>Say,
Wharton,</hi> and <hi>Roberts;</hi> and thirteen of the
Houſe of Commons, Mr. <hi>Perpoint,</hi> Mr. <hi>Fines,</hi>
Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> Senior and Junior, Sir <hi>William
Armin,</hi> Sir <hi>Arthur Hazlerig,</hi> Sir <hi>Gilbert Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The Parliament, though victorious, though
guarded with a gallant Army, no forces viſibly
appearing againſt it, yet was never in more
danger. All men began in the Spring to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,
that the Summer would be a hot one,
in reſpect of Wars, ſeeing how the Countries
were divided in Factions, the Scots full of
threats, the city of <hi>London</hi> as full of unqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs.
And more ſad things were feared
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:49178:97"/>
where leaſt was ſeen; rumours every day
frightning the people, of ſecret Plots, and
treaſonable meetings. From whence every
man began to foreſee ſlaughter and war, as
Mariners uſe to foreſee a riſing Tempeſt.</p>

            <p>The King's Party began to ſwell with great
hopes, and look upon themſelves not as van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd,
but Conquerors; nor could they forbear
vaunting everywhere, but talked of the Kings
riſing, and ruine of the Parliament. The ſame
thing ſeemed to be the wiſh of thoſe whom
they called Presbyterians, who were ready to
ſacrifice themſelves and their Cauſe to their
hatred againſt the Independents; who wiſhed
that quite undone, which themſelves could
not do; and deſired, that liberty might be
quite taken away by the King, rather then
vindicated by the Independents.</p>
            <p>The King himſelf, though ſet aſide, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
within the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> was more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:49178:98"/>
this Summer, then in any other, when
he was followed by his ſtrongeſt Armies. The
name of King had now a further operation,
and pity of the Vulgar gave a greater Majeſty
to his Perſon. Prince <hi>Charls</hi> alſo by his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
and the name of baniſhment, was
more deſireable by thoſe Vulgar people, and
by his Commiſſions (which his Father private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſent him) as if armed with lawful power,
did eaſily command thoſe that were willing;
and by commands under his name, was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to raiſe (as will afterward appear) not
onely Tumults, but Wars.</p>
            <p>The beginning was by Tumults, and in the
City, from whence alſo the following Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
in the neer Counties had their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;
and was by Apprentices, and looſe young
people playing in <hi>More</hi>-fields upon a Sunday,
the ninth day of <hi>April,</hi> who diſpiſing the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of Magiſtrates, ſet upon a Captain of
the trained Bands, and with ſtones beat him
out of the fields; and taking away his colours,
with them they marched, a diſorderly rout
(gathering up many of the ſcum of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
as they paſſed) to <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> crying out
as they went, that they were for King <hi>Charls.</hi>
But they by a Troop of Horſe out of the <hi>Mews</hi>
were quickly ſcattered. But running back, and
getting into <hi>London</hi> (while other diſorderly
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:49178:98"/>
fellows came into them) they remained all
night in a whole body, filling the City with
fears; ſo that the Lord Major, a man cordial
to the Parliament, was enforced to eſcape
privily out of his Houſe, and flye into the
Tower. In the morning, General <hi>Fairfax,</hi> to
cruſh this miſchief in the beginning, before
the wound were grown incurable, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of wicked men, ſent a part of his Army
into the City; who vanquiſhing the <hi>Seditious,</hi>
and driving them into <hi>Leaden Hall</hi> (of whom
ſome they carried away Priſoners) with great
valour, and no leſs prudence, quieted the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult.
For delivering the City from ſo horrid
a danger, thanks were given to the General,
both by the Parliament, and the honeſt ſober
Citizens, and a thouſand pounds in money
given as a gratuity to the Souldiers.</p>
            <p>In the very Petitions alſo, at that Malignant
time, nothing but ſedition &amp; War was contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
as appeared in thoſe of <hi>Surrey</hi> and <hi>Kent.</hi>
From <hi>Surrey,</hi> about three hundred came to
<hi>Weſtminſter</hi> on the twenty ſixth of <hi>May,</hi> bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Petition to the Parliament, in which they
did not ſo much entreat, as command in high
words, <hi>That the King ſhould preſently be reſtored
to his former dignity, and come to</hi> Weſtminſter
<hi>with Honour, Freedom and ſafety, to treat per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally
there about all Controverſies; that the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:49178:99"/>
Army ſhould preſently be disbanded, and the free
people of</hi> England <hi>be governed by their known
Laws and Statutes;</hi> with other things of this
nature. Nor would theſe <hi>Surrey</hi>-men, that
brought the Petition, endure any delay, no,
not ſo much, as till the Parliament could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
about it; but being extream inſolent, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
and railing openly at the Parliament, they
ſet upon the Souldiers who were their guard;
of whom, ſome they hurt, and one they killed.
Upon which, a troop of Horſe from the <hi>Mews,</hi>
and ſome Foot, were ſent to help their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
who ſoon vanquiſhed and ſcattered
thoſe Country Fellows, and ſlew ſome of
them. This was the end of that ſeditious Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
of <hi>Surrey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At that time the Kentiſh-men were coming
with a Petition of that nature; who being in
number of a good Army, ſeemed afar off to
threaten the Parliament. They had been the
more ſtirred, by reaſon of a ſevere puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of ſome of their Country-men, who
had lately raiſed a ſedition about <hi>Canterbury:</hi>
againſt theſe Kentiſh-men the Parliament pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
no ſmaller defence, then the General
<hi>Fairfax</hi> himſelf, who with ſeven Regiments
marched away to <hi>Black Heath</hi> neer <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich;</hi>
of whoſe ſucceſs we ſhall ſpeak after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:49178:99"/>
The Parliament had before deſigned, that
General <hi>Fairfax</hi> ſhould march into the North
to defend thoſe parts; but nearer dangers
detained him in the South. For at this time
ſcarce any part of <hi>England</hi> was quiet; in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
place tumults, inſurrections, and Wars
were threatned. To quell all theſe, (which
was wonderful) one onely Army ſufficed,
by the great bleſſing of God upon it. Which
Army, as when it was conjoyned, in one
year, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1646. it quite vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and broke all the Kings flouriſhing
ſtrength, and reduced the Kingdom to the
obedience of Parliament: ſo at this time
with no leſs fortitude and felicity, being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into parts, in all corners of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
it continued Victorious; ſo that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
and fortune might ſeeme in that Army
(as the ſoul in an humane body) to be all in
the whole, and all in every part. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
thoſe light, and ſoon-ſuppreſſed inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
of <hi>Suffolke</hi> in the Eaſt, and of <hi>Stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
in the mid-land part, by Col. <hi>Wait</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and of <hi>Cornwal</hi> in the Weſt by Sir <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe
Waller,</hi> more great and formidable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections
happened in the Northern parts,
and in <hi>Wales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the beginning of <hi>May</hi> the North was
infeſted by ſome of the Kings Commanders;
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:49178:100"/>
Sir <hi>Thomas Glenham,</hi> who had before gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
ſo many Gariſons of the Kings, as <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſle,
York,</hi> and <hi>Oxford;</hi> and loſt them all;
had now, with no better ſucceſs, ſeized upon
<hi>Carliſle.</hi> And at the ſame time Sir <hi>Marma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke
Langdale</hi> (of whom we ſpake before) had
ſeized upon <hi>Berwick,</hi> and fortified it. The
ſtrong Caſtle alſo of <hi>Pomfret</hi> was then taken
by the Royaliſts, who by treachery had ſlain
the Governour thereof. To manage theſe
Wars in the North, <hi>Lambert,</hi> a ſtout Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,
and Major-General of thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
was left with ſome Regiments of the
<hi>Fairfaxian</hi> Army.</p>
            <p>But dangers of a more horrid degree ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

parts, had raiſed a gallant Army, under whom
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:49178:100"/>
Colonel <hi>Powel</hi> ſerved. In a ſmall time (the
<hi>Welch</hi> coming in apace to him) <hi>Laughorns</hi>
Army was ſo increaſed, that he muſtered
8000. Both <hi>Laughorn</hi> &amp; <hi>Poyer</hi> (as it afterward
appeared) entred into this War by a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
received from Prince <hi>Charles;</hi> whoſe
Auſpicy proved no better then his Fathers.
Colonel <hi>Horton</hi> with a ſmall part of the
<hi>Fairfaxian</hi> Army, and ſome other raiſed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
went againſt them with three thouſand
men, But it pleaſed God, the giver of all
Victories, that the ſucceſs was not according
to the number; for <hi>Horton</hi> on the eighth
day of <hi>May,</hi> between the two Towns of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi>
and. <hi>Peterſtone</hi> encountring with <hi>Laug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn,</hi>
totally routed, and put to flight his
whole Army, conſiſting of eight thouſand
Horſe and Foot. A great ſlaughter was made
upon the place, and the number of Priſoners
(being three thouſand) equalled the number
of the Victorious Army; among whom were
taken about an hundred and fifty Officers; a
great number of Colours, and quantity of
Arms, with all their Ordnance.</p>
            <p>There was ſcarce a more happy Victory (as
the condition of things then ſtood) to the
Parliament, then this of <hi>Hortons;</hi> for which, by
order of Parliament, a publike thanksgiving
to God was celebrated. <hi>Laughorn</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:49178:101"/>
eſcaping by flight, got to <hi>Poyer</hi> into <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook</hi>
Caſtle. <hi>Cromwell</hi> himſelf about the
beginning of <hi>May</hi> was ſent into <hi>Wales</hi> with
ſome Regiments, who on the eleventh day
of that moneth came to <hi>Chepſtow</hi> Caſtle,
which he reſolved to beſiege; but haſtening
to <hi>Pembrook,</hi> he left Colonel <hi>Ewer</hi> at <hi>Chep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow,</hi>
who within fifteen days took that Caſtle,
and killed <hi>Kemiſh,</hi> to whom before the place
had been betrayed; and <hi>Cromwel</hi> on the
twentieth of <hi>May</hi> came to <hi>Pembrook.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Poyer</hi> relying on the ſtrength of the place,
refuſed all conditions, knowing beſides, that
time was now pretious to the Parliament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then entangled in ſo many difficulties at
once. But <hi>Cromwel</hi> not being accuſtomed to
deſpair of any thing, prepared for the Siege,
being much furthered in his work from the
Sea, by the great induſtry of Sir <hi>George Ayſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cough,</hi>
who commanded there a ſquadron of
the <hi>Navy.</hi> Sir <hi>George Ayſcough</hi> with much
care and diligence from time to time furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Leiutenant</hi> General <hi>Cromwel</hi> with great
Guns, with proviſions of all ſorts from <hi>Briſtol,</hi>
and other places, and every thing neceſſary
for a Siege.</p>
            <p>While theſe things were acting in <hi>Wales,</hi>
General <hi>Fairfax,</hi> ſent (as before was ſaid)
with ſeven Regiments to ſuppreſs the Kenriſh
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:49178:101"/>
Riſers, purſued them towards <hi>Rocheſter.</hi> A
great number of Kentiſh men not far from
<hi>Graveſend</hi> were gotten together into an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
with whom were above twenty Knights,
Eſquires, and Gentlemen of the County; and
among them divers commanders formerly of
the King Armies; though they were more in
number, they durſt not give the General battel;
but ſome marched away to <hi>Maidſtone,</hi> a few
kept together about <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> another part of
them went to <hi>Dover,</hi> and beſieged that Caſtle;
to raiſe that Siege the General ſent Colonel
<hi>Rich,</hi> and Sir <hi>Michael Leveſy;</hi> who very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
performed that work.</p>
            <p>The General himſelf marched with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to <hi>Maidſtone.</hi> Into that Town about two
thouſand of the Riſers were gotten, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to make good the place. The General
likewiſe prepared to beſiege them. In no
chance of War before, was the vertue of
<hi>Fairfax</hi> and his Souldiers more tryed, nor a
Victory bought with greater danger. For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that the Souldiers had broke into the
Town (which was done with great difficulty)
they found a War in every ſtreet, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dnance
planted againſt them, and were put
to fight for every corner of it. At laſt the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
with the loſs of forty of his men, took
the Town, two hundred of the Enemies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:49178:102"/>
ſlain, and about fourteen hundred taken
priſoners; four hundred Horſe, and two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Arms were taken. One thing was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful,
that an Army of many thouſand Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh
men, more in number then the Generals
Army, coming from <hi>Rocheſter</hi> to the aid of
their friends, yet notwithſtanding, when they
came neer, durſt not venture to aſſiſt them;
but ſtood in ſight, while the General took the
Town. Publike thanks were given to God,
by order of Parliament, for this great victory.</p>
            <p>Now all <hi>Kent</hi> ſeemed to be quieted (except
ſome Caſtles, which alſo within a ſhort time
were taken, or yielded to the Parliament)
when ſuddenly a new head of this <hi>Hydra</hi>
ſprung up; the Lord <hi>Goring</hi> gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a remnant of the <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Army, with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
two thouſand men, had marched as far
as <hi>Greenwich,</hi> from whence he ſent ſome to
ſee how the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> ſtood affected
to the buſineſs; but whilſt he ſtaid expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an anſwer, ſome Troops of the Army came
in ſight, upon which <hi>Goring</hi> and all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
fled: the Horſemen purſuing, took ſome
Booty and divers priſoners: the <hi>Kentiſh</hi> men
for the moſt part fled to their own Houſes:
The Lord <hi>Goring,</hi> with about five hundred
horſe, flying from <hi>Greenwich,</hi> and getting
Boats, croſſed the Thames into <hi>Eſſex,</hi> where
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:49178:102"/>
(as if the Fates ſought out new Victories for
<hi>Fairfax</hi> every where) the Lord <hi>Capel,</hi> with
Forces out of <hi>Hartfortſhire,</hi> and Sir <hi>Charles
Lucas</hi> with a body of Horſe, at <hi>Chensford</hi> in
<hi>Eſſex</hi> joyned themſelves to <hi>Goring,</hi> to whom
within a ſhort time divers, that formerly had
been the King Souldiers, and many <hi>Londoners,</hi>
with others, flocked. Some alſo of higher
rank, as Mr. <hi>Haſtings,</hi> brother to <hi>Hunting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi>
and <hi>Compton,</hi> brother to the Earl of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The General <hi>Fairfax,</hi> croſſing the Thames
at <hi>Graveſend,</hi> paſſed with a part of his Army
into <hi>Eſſex;</hi> and ſending for the reſt of his
Forces out of <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> purſued the
Enemies; whom at laſt he drove into <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi>
and in that Town beſieged them:
where (becauſe it proved a long ſiege) we
leave him for a time, and paſs to other actions.</p>
            <p>The greateſt of all dangers which threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the Parliament, was from the North, not
contained within the bounds of <hi>England</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but from the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland;</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
General <hi>Lambert,</hi> the chief Commander in
the North, labouring to ſuppreſs <hi>Glenham</hi> and
<hi>Langdale,</hi> wrought ſo much, that he kept them
within the bounds of <hi>Cumberland</hi> and <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merland;</hi>
but they expected the march of the
Scotiſh Army, to which they intended to
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:49178:103"/>
joyn themſelves. <hi>Lambert,</hi> too weak to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
ſo great a Force, omitted no diligence
in ſtrengthening himſelf from the neighbour-Counties,
who were very forward to his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,
eſpecially <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> who raiſed two
Regiments of Horſe, and four of Foot, to be
conducted by Major General <hi>Aſhton,</hi> and
joyn with <hi>Lambert</hi> in <hi>Yorkeſhire.</hi> The Engliſh
Malignants alone were not very formidable
in the North, but that the Kingdome of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
joyned with them againſt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Wars were made from another King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
that <hi>Cromwel</hi> might be victorious as
well againſt Forraigners, as Engliſhmen.</p>
            <p>The faction of Duke <hi>Hamliton</hi> was then
prevalent in the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by
whom Deſigns were hatched, dangerous to
both Kingdoms, contrary to peace, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
(for ſo it was judged by the Church of
<hi>Scotland)</hi> even to the Covenant it ſelf. <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
was to be invaded, and a great Army rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
under the Command of Duke <hi>Hamliton,</hi>
a man ambitious and ſubtle. The Engliſh Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants
(for it was given out that they took
Arms for the King) were invited to joyn
with them, and pay promiſed to thoſe that
would ſerve; all this was done, though <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile,
Louden,</hi> and the honeſter Lords pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
againſt their proceedings; and the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:49178:103"/>
Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi> curſed that War as impious.</p>
            <p>But the greater part prevailed, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſtiled themſelves the Parliament of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
by a kinde of right; and to curb men of
the adverſe faction, a Commitee was made,
with power given to them to puniſh all thoſe
who ſhould attempt any thing againſt the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
of the Parliament; and a penalty ſet
down, to be inflicted upon all Miniſters, who
ſhould from their Pulpits teach the people
otherwiſe: by which means it was brought
to paſs, that many Miniſters were ſilenced,
others puniſhed; and ſome Lords of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
faction retired themſelves to their own
ſtrengths; yet could they not ſtop the mouths
of all the Miniſters; ſome with a conſtant
Zeal denounced the wrath of God againſt
that Army of <hi>Hamilton;</hi> and by the wretched
ſucceſs of that unfortuneate Army, the curſes
of the Kirk ſeemed not in vain, no more then
of old the Tribunes curſe upon the Parthian
Expedition of <hi>Marcus Craſſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſpiracies by Land (though over the
whole Iland) againſt the Parliament of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
ſeemed not enough, unleſs the Sea al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
had rebelled againſt them: Divers of the
chief Ships in the Royal Fleet revolted from
the Parliament about the beginning of <hi>June,</hi>
and ſet the Vice-Admiral <hi>Rainsborough</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore;
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:49178:104"/>
affirming they were for the King, and
would ſerve Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> ſailing towards
<hi>Holland,</hi> where the Prince then was, and with
him his brother the Duke of <hi>York;</hi> who not
long before fled privately (being perſwaded
thereto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by Letters from the King his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
out of <hi>London,</hi> where he had been kept
with great obſervance and ſtate by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
            <p>The Parliament were much troubled at the
revolt of theſe Ships, as a thing of extream
danger; and ſent to the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> to
take the Command of their remaining Navy,
and reduce the reſt if he could. <hi>Warwick</hi>
cheerfully accepted the employment, and was
by the Parliament created (which Title he
had born at the beginning of theſe Wars)
Lord High Admiral of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whileſt <hi>Warwick</hi> was ſerving the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
his Brother the Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
riſe in Arms againſt it. Relying (as it
ſeems) upon the opportunity of time, while
the Navy was revolted, whileſt <hi>Fairfax</hi> in
<hi>Kent, Cromwel</hi> in <hi>Wales</hi> were buſied: he built
likewiſe upon the affections of the Citizens
of <hi>London;</hi> of whom he made tryal; and
joyning the young Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and
his Brother with others to him, he appeared
in Arms by <hi>Kingston</hi> with five hundred
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:49178:104"/>
Horſe; but by Sir <hi>Michael Leveſey,</hi> and others,
who took occaſion by the fore-ſock, he was
thereput to flight, &amp; the Lord <hi>Francis Villiers</hi>
was ſlain; <hi>Holland</hi> flying with the remainder
of his Horſe, was within few dayes after, at
the Town of St. <hi>Needs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> by Col. <hi>Scroop</hi> (whom
the General had ſent from <hi>Colcheſter</hi> for that
purpoſe) altogether ſubdued; <hi>Dalbeer,</hi> and
ſome other Gentlemen ſlain, <hi>Holland</hi> himſelf
was taken, and by the Parliament committed
priſoner to <hi>Warwick</hi>-Caſtle.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time <hi>Roſſiter</hi> alſo obtained for
the Parliament a gallant victory over the
forces of <hi>Pomfret</hi>-Caſtle, whom as they were
pillaging the Country, and plundering up and
down, being a thouſand Horſe, <hi>Roſſiter</hi> fell
upon, vanquiſhed, and took priſoners all their
Commanders, took all their Arms and Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage.
<hi>Roſſiter</hi> himſelf (which for a time abated
the joy of this victory) was grievouſly woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
but he recovered.</p>
            <p>Theſe victories obtained everywhere by the
Parliament, though ſome of them may ſeem
ſmall, yet will appear great, and worthy of
commemoration to all thoſe who conſider
how much the Commonwealth, if but one of
theſe fights had miſcarried, had been endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered:
and the Parliament it ſelf, weighing
the number and variety of their hazards, may
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:49178:105"/>
the better acknowledge the continuance of
Gods providence, and his very hand with
them. By theſe little victories alſo a way was
made for higher Trophies, and an abſolute
ſubjugation of all their Enemies, which about
this time miraculouſly happened.</p>
            <p>For now moſt opportunely was <hi>Pembrook</hi>-Caſtle
ſurrendred to <hi>Cromwel,</hi> which <hi>Poyer</hi> and
<hi>Laughorn,</hi> confiding in the ſtrength of the
place, had ſo long ſtifly maintained. But at
laſt, brought to extremities, they delivered it
without conditions, rendring themſelves Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners
at mercy. Which fell out at the ſame
time (Fates calling <hi>Cromwel</hi> to a greater at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheivement)
that Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> with a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
Army of Scots had entred <hi>England,</hi> &amp;
about the beginning of of <hi>July,</hi> was further
ſtrengthned by the addition of <hi>Langdales</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
<hi>Hamilton</hi> marched above five and twenty
thouſand ſtong, ſtriking a great terror every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where;
ſcarce in the whole time of theſe
wars did any Army exerciſe greater cruelty
toward the poor inhabitants of <hi>England.</hi> And
yet when the Parliament debated concerning
this Army, the Houſe of Peers could hardly
be brought to declare them Enemies. For
the Houſe of Commons had declared, <hi>That
the Scots that under Duke</hi> Hamilton <hi>Invaded</hi>
England, <hi>were Enemies; and that all the Engliſh
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:49178:105"/>
which joyned with them were Traitors to their
Country.</hi> To which Vote the Lords at laſt,
after much debate, aſſented. The chief Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
of <hi>London,</hi> and others, called Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians
(though the Presbyterian Scots abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
this Scotiſh Army) wiſhed good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
to theſe Scots, no leſs then the Malignants
did. Whence let the Reader judge of the
times.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lambert,</hi> though too weak in all probability
for ſo potent an enemy, was not diſcouraged;
but reſolved to oppoſe the preſent danger, and,
if need required, to fight the Scots: but he
daily expected the coming of <hi>Cromwel,</hi> to
whoſe conduct, this victory was reſerved. In
the mean time, with prudent retreates, &amp; ſome
Skirmiſhes, not onely with <hi>Langdale,</hi> but <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi>
himſelf, he ſpun out the time ſo long,
until that <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s great Army having on the
twentieth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> entred into <hi>Lancaſhire,
Cromwel</hi> was arrived with his forces, who,
with the addition of <hi>Lambert</hi>'s ſtrength made
an Army of almoſt ten thouſand.</p>
            <p>This famous battel was fought neer to <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi>
in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> in which all the forces of
<hi>Hamilton</hi> and <hi>Langdale</hi> were vanquiſhed and
put to flight, whom the Conqueror purſuing as
far as <hi>Warrington,</hi> (about twenty miles) and
killing many in the chaſe, took Lieutenant
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:49178:106"/>
General <hi>Baily</hi> priſoner, with a great part of
the Scottiſh Army, granting them onely
quarter for their lives. In this battel were
ſlain three thouſand Scots, and taken priſoners
about nine thouſand: Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> himſelf
within few dayes after, having fled with a
good party of Horſe to <hi>Uttoxeter,</hi> was there
taken priſoner by the Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> and Colonel
<hi>Wait:</hi> with <hi>Hamilton</hi> were taken about three
thouſand Horſe. <hi>Langdale</hi> alſo, not long after,
was taken priſoner in a little Village, by <hi>Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merpool</hi>
a Parliament-Captain. This was the
ſucceſs of <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s invading <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Preſently after this famous victory of <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,
Colcheſter</hi> was ſurrendred to General <hi>Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax:</hi>
three months almoſt had the General lien
before that Town, with a ſmall Army, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the number of the beſieged, in a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
rainy ſeaſon; where the Souldiers pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
no leſs then their valour, was tried. <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
Capel, Haſtings, Lucas,</hi> and the other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,
until they were reduced to extream
neceſſity, would not hear of yielding, but deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed
all conditions: their courages were long
upheld by vain hopes (beſides the ſmalneſs of
the General's Army) of aid by inſurrections at
<hi>London,</hi> and of the ſucceſs of <hi>Hamilton, Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi>
or the E. of <hi>Holland;</hi> and more eſpecially,
of ſuccor by Sea from Prince <hi>Charls,</hi> who was
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:49178:106"/>
now poſſeſſed of thoſe Ships which had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted
from the Parliament; and having taken
divers Merchants Ships beſides, was himſelf in
perſon, with no contemptible Fleet, come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the narrow Seas.</p>
            <p>But about the end of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the beſieged in
<hi>Colcheſter,</hi> deſpairing of any relief, and reduc'd
to extremities, (for they had long fed upon
Horſe-fleſh) yielded themſelves to the mercy
of the Conqueror. Two onely ſuffered, Sir <hi>Ch.
Lucas,</hi> and Sir <hi>George Liſle,</hi> who were ſhot to
death. <hi>Goring, Capel,</hi> and <hi>Hastings</hi> were ſent
to priſon, to abide the doom of Parliament.</p>
            <p>Thus was the Parliament everywhere vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious
by Land, nor were they unhappy by
Sea. For conſidering that revolt of the Navy,
it was to be accounted a great felicity, that
no more revolted after them, or no farther
miſchief enſued. But the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi>
was very careful; and it pleaſed God by this
fright, rather then loſs, to let the Parliament
know the frailty of their own condition.</p>
            <p>About the end of <hi>Auguſt, Warwick</hi> with a
good Fleet was in the River <hi>Thames;</hi> when
Prince <hi>Charls</hi> with a greater force, about
twenty ſail, was come upon the River
againſt him, and ſent a command to <hi>Warwick</hi>
to take down his Flag, and yield obedience
to him as ſupream Admiral, having the King's
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:49178:107"/>
Commiſſion to that purpoſe. But <hi>Warwick</hi>
true to the Parliament, obeyed not the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons;
nor was there any convenient place
in that narrow Channel (eſpecially for the
larger Veſſels) to make a naval fight; and <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi>'s
Fleet not ſtrong enough to encounter
the Prince, ſtayed for the coming of their
friends the <hi>Porchmouth</hi>-Fleet. The govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and bringing about of that Fleet was
committed to the care of Sir <hi>George Ayſcough;</hi>
nor did the Lord Admiral <hi>Warwick</hi> know
certainly what was become of that <hi>Porch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi>-Fleet,
whether that alſo were revolted,
for ſo the rumonrs were every day in <hi>London.</hi>
And certain it is, that the Mariners being ſo
ill-affected in general, and daily corrupted
by the Townſmen in <hi>Porchmouth,</hi> that Fleet
had been loſt from the Parliament (by which
means the other could not have ſubſiſted) if
the diſcretion of Sir <hi>George Ayſcough,</hi> his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimation
among the Sea-men, and their love
to him, had not (happily for the Parliament)
then appeared. He wiſely ſounding the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of them, caſhiering the worſt, to
prevent the ſpreading of that contagion, did
with many endeavours, and great difficulty,
ſo well prevail at laſt, that he confirmed the
whole Fleet in the Parliaments obedience;
And very ſucceſsfully ſailing by Prince <hi>Charles</hi>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:49178:107"/>
in the night, brought all his Ships ſafe to the
Earl of <hi>Warwick.</hi> Who now ſtrengthened by
<hi>Ayſcoughs</hi> coming with the <hi>Porchmouth</hi> Fleet,
reſolved to make toward his Enemies. But
finding that the Prince for want of Victual,
was gone back into <hi>Holland,</hi> he followed him,
not long after, with the whole Fleet, to <hi>Gore,</hi>
upon the Coaſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cromwel,</hi> after he had given that great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat
to <hi>Hamilton,</hi> following his Victory, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to help <hi>Arguile,</hi> and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
againſt the Forces of <hi>Monroe</hi> and <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike;</hi>
Which he effected with great felicity,
and reduced thoſe Gariſons, which the Scots
and Engliſh Malignants had before ſeized,
namely <hi>Berwick</hi> and <hi>Carliſle</hi> into the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
power. Then going into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to
conſult about the ſafety of both Kingdoms,
he was moſt honourably entertained in the
Caſtle of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> Many of the Scotiſh
Nobility and Gentry were ſent from the
Commitee of Eſtate to meet <hi>Cromwel;</hi> who,
after congratulatory Orations made, conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him to <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> where <hi>Arguile, Leven,</hi>
and other Lords entertained him, and the reſt
of the Engliſh Commanders, with a moſt
magnificent banquet in the Caſtle. Thanks
were given by the Miniſters to <hi>Cromwel,</hi> who
was by them ſtyled the preſerver of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:49178:108"/>
under God. Such alſo is the teſtimony of
the Committee of Eſtate, written to the
Engliſh Parliament concerning <hi>Cromwel;</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
after, the forces of <hi>Monroe</hi> and <hi>Lane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike</hi>
were disbanded, and all other forces, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
fifteen hundred Horſe and Foot; which
were to ſtand under the Command of <hi>Leven,</hi>
untill the Kingdome were ſetled. It was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
decreed both by the Committee of Eſtate,
and Aſſembly of the Kirk, <hi>For preſervation of
Religion, and brotherly amity with the Engliſh
Nation,</hi> That no man, which had joyned with
<hi>Hamilton</hi> in the late invaſion of <hi>England,</hi>
ſhould be choſen into the new Parliament,
(which was then called) or into the Aſſembly
of the Kirk. For the Faction of <hi>Hamilton</hi>
were judged Enemies to Religion, and both
the Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>It was worthy of noting, that that Engliſh
Army, which were by the religious Party of
<hi>Scotland</hi> called <hi>A bundle of Sectariés,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled
by all opprobrious names, ſhould now
be acknowledged by the ſame Scots to be the
Inſtruments of God, and Vindicators both
of the Church and Kingdom of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
The greateſt Peers of <hi>Scotland</hi> alſo did inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly
confeſs their Raſhneſs and Errour the
year before, for accuſing this Army as Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious,
for acting the very ſame things in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:49178:108"/>
which now themſelves were enforced
to act in <hi>Scotland,</hi> for preſervation of that
Kingdom.</p>
            <p>This great change in the Council of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
had been to be wondred at, if the change
that then happened in the Engliſh Parliament
had not been a greater Miracle. Who would
not be amazed at this, That <hi>Cromwel,</hi> for van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhing
a Scotiſh Army, by which he delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>England</hi> from the worſt of Miſeries, ſhould
be acknowledged there the Preſerver of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> and not here allowed the Preſerver
of <hi>England!</hi> and that the ſame Victory of
his againſt Scots, ſhould pleaſe the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
Scots for Religions ſake, and for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ſake diſpleaſe the Presbyterians of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land!
Oedipus</hi> himſelf cannot unriddle this;
eſpecially if he judge according to Reaſon, not
according to what Envie, Hate, and embit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
Faction can work.</p>
            <p>The face of the Engliſh Parliament was
now ſuddenly changed; and the Votes which
paſſed the year before, namely, of <hi>making no
more Addreſſes to the King,</hi> were annulled
and made void: thoſe Votes, upon which the
Parliament (as before is ſaid) had publiſhed a
Declaration to inform the World concerning
the reaſon and neceſſity of their proceedings.
Their Counſels were now quite changed, and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:49178:109"/>
new Addreſſes to the King (the formerly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached
members being again reſtored to
their Seats) with more ſubmiſſive earneſtneſs
then ever before were reſolved on. The
Houſes then fell into a Debate about propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to be framed, and a Treaty to be had
with the King (before he had given any ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
or ſecurity to the people) perſonally
at <hi>London,</hi> with Honour, Freedom, and ſafety.</p>
            <p>But that was not carried. Onely a Treaty
was Voted to be in the Ile of <hi>VVight,</hi> and
that the King ſhould chooſe the place within
that Iland. Therefore on the fourth of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi>
the Earl of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> with two of the
Houſe of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons were ſent to the King. Who
made anſwer, that he was very ready to treat
of Peace; and named <hi>Newport</hi> in that Iland
to be the place. For that buſineſs Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners
were preſently choſen out of both
Houſes; Five Peers, <hi>Northumberland, Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook,
Salisbury, Middleſex,</hi> and <hi>Say.</hi> Ten of
the Commons, Lord <hi>VVainman, Hollis, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point,
Vane</hi> junior, <hi>Grimſtone, Pots, Brown,
Crew, Glyn,</hi> and <hi>Buckley.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King, during this treaty, found not
onely great reverence and obſervance from
the Commiſſioners of Parliament: but was
attended with a Prince-like retinue; and was
allowed what ſervans he ſhould chooſe, to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:49178:109"/>
make up the Splendor of a Court. The Duke
of <hi>Richmond,</hi> the Marqueſs of <hi>Hartford,</hi> the
Earls, <hi>Southampton</hi> and <hi>Lindſey,</hi> with other
Gentlemen of note, and a competent number
of them, waited in his train; his own Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains,
and divers of his Lawyers, to adviſe
him in the Treaty, were allowed there.</p>
            <p>But while this Treaty proceeded, and ſome
months were ſpent in debates, conceſſions,
and denyals; behold, another ſtrange altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
happened, which threw the King from
the heighth of honour into the loweſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
So ſtrangely did one contrary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
another. Whilſt ſome laboured to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
the King into his Throne again upon
ſlender conditions, or none at all; others
weighing what the King had done, what the
Commonwealth, and eſpecially what the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
friends might ſuffer, if he ſhould
come to raign again with unchanged affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
deſired to take him quite away. From
hence divers and frequent Petitions were
preſented to the Parliament, and ſome to the
General <hi>Fairfax, That whoſoever had offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
againſt the Commonwealth, no perſons except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
might come to Judgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt Petition of that kinde was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to the Parliament upon the eleventh
day of <hi>September.</hi> The Title of the Petition
was,
<q>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:49178:110"/>
                  <p>To the moſt honourable the Commons of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
aſſembled in Parliament:</p>
                  <p>The humble Petition of many Thouſands of well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected
men in the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and
<hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> in the Borough of <hi>Southwark,</hi>
and the neighbouring Villages, Inhabitants.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This Petition, which broke the Ice, was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
in the ſpace of one month, by many
other Petitions of the ſame kinde, from divers
Counties of <hi>England,</hi> and ſeveral Regiments
of the Army; namely, from the County of
<hi>Oxford,</hi> on the 30 of <hi>September:</hi> from the
County of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> on the ſecond of <hi>October:</hi>
from many Commanders in the Army, on the
4 of <hi>October.</hi> Three other Petitions brought
upon one day; namely, the 10 of <hi>October:</hi>
another from <hi>Ireton</hi>'s Regiment, on the 18 of
<hi>October:</hi> and another from <hi>Inglesbies</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
on the 21 day of the ſame month.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſcope of all theſe Petitions was the
ſame, That Juſtice might be done, and that
the Chief Authors of ſo much bloodſhed in</hi>
England, <hi>and ſo many calamities to the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
namely, thoſe, who had been the raiſers
of this Second War, and were now in the
Parliaments cuſtody,</hi> Hamilton, Holland, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
Goring, <hi>and the reſt, might be puniſhed.
But eſpecially they intreat, that the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
the Chief offender, the raiſer of the whole
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:49178:110"/>
War, and author of</hi> Englands <hi>calamity, might
be called to Judgement:</hi> That the Parliament
would give them leave to remember what the
Parliament it ſelf had the yeer before decreed and
declared againſt the King; and what the Kirk
of <hi>Scotland</hi> in 1646, had declared against the
ſame King; That he was guilty (beſides other
horrid Crimes) of ſhedding the blood of many
thouſands of his best Subjects. Which things, if
they were true, and not at all puniſhed, nor any ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
made; it might be feared would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
(by ſo much injustice) the wrath of God,
who had delivered that King (after ſo bloody a
War) into their hands. They therefore humbly
intreat the Parliament, that they would not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefully
throw away ſo many miraculous deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances
of Almighty God, nor betray themſelves
and their faithful friends, by deceitful Treaties, to
an implacable Enemy.</p>
            <p>This was the ſenſe of all thoſe Petitions,
which, during the Treaty, were daily preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Parliament, and by them laid aſide.
But at laſt, theſe Deſires prevailed; eſpecially
after that the Remonſtrance of the Lord Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
and the General Council of Officers
held at St. <hi>Albans</hi> the 16 of <hi>November</hi> 1648.
was preſented to the Parliament on the 20
of the ſame <hi>November.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But by what means, or what degrees, it
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:49178:111"/>
came at laſt ſo far, as that the King was
brought to trial, condemned, and beheaded:
becauſe the full ſearch and enarration of ſo
great a buſineſs would make an Hiſtory by it
ſelf, it cannot well be brought into this BRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIARY;
which having paſſed over ſo long a
time, ſhall here conclude.</p>
