            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Intelligible Reader.</head>
            <p>DId not Cuſtom claim an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, I might have ſaved my ſelf this labour of writing one; and yet let me tell thee, that good Wine may be ſold within, although there hangs no Buſh at the door. Now thou doſt expect (I ſuppoſe) that I ſhould ſay ſomething of theſe Jeſts; if I ſhould tell thee that they were all good, I think thou wouldſt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me; and if thou ſhouldſt ſay they were all bad, I profeſs I ſhould not believe thee. I ſuppoſe they are not like to the women in the World, becauſe here is more good ones then bad ones; whereas amongſt them,
<pb facs="tcp:36894:3"/>
there is more bad then good: if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the peruſal of them thou finde fault, reflect upon thy ſelf, whether thou haſt not more Vices then Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues within thee, and forbear to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure too rigidly, leſt a wiſer head then thy own commending them, thou for thy pains be accounted a fool.</p>
            <p>But me thinks I hear ſome long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ear'd fellow to ſay that the moſt of theſe are but Collections, the Works of other men; and therefore the leſs to be regarded: why <hi>Apes-face,</hi> let me aſk thee this Queſtion; Is the Honey the worſe, becauſe the Bee ſucks it out of many flowers? or is the Spiders Web the more to be praiſed, becauſe it is extracted out of her own Bowels? Wilt thou ſay the Taylor did not make the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe the Cloath it was made of, was weaved by the Weaver? 'Tis true, many of theſe Jeſts were delivered before by others; but with ſo much prolixity, and in ſuch a
<pb facs="tcp:36894:3"/>
rough ſtile, as was both tedious and unpleaſant to the Reader; but now they are ſo ordered, that the worſt of them all may paſs with approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if thou doeſt not marre their ſence, by thy ill-favour'd reading of them; which if thou ſhouldeſt do in my hearing, I profeſs, as I am a true man, an honeſt man, and no Taylor, I ſhould be very angry with thee for thy labour.</p>
            <p>And now let me tell thee, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the old, here is a great many new ones; yea, ſpick and ſpan new, ſcattered amongſt the others (like Plumbs in a Cake) to make the old ones to reliſh the better: and indeed Jeſts are like Cakes, which ſhould have in them the ſweet <hi>Plumbs</hi> of pleaſant language, <hi>ſpiced</hi> with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and <hi>ſugered</hi> with pleaſure; but the neareſt reſemblance is, that Jeſts and Cakes are both of them beſt when they are broken.</p>
            <p>Now if thou likeſt them, <hi>ſo</hi>; if thou
<pb facs="tcp:36894:4"/>
diſlike them, then <hi>ſo, ſo:</hi> but if thy teeth ſtand like an old Park-pale, here one rotten, and there one out; forbear to read them before thy Sweet-heart, leſt when thou grinneſt, thou diſcover ſo much, as to help thee, thou be forced to flee to the old Proverb for refuge, <hi>That thoſe whoſe teeth are out kiſs ſoftly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Much more might be ſaid, if there were a neceſſity for it; but if thou beeſt not <hi>wiſe,</hi> then thou art <hi>other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe</hi>; now if thou beeſt <hi>wiſe,</hi> then <hi>a word to the wiſe is ſufficient</hi>; and if beeſt <hi>otherwiſe,</hi> all the words that I can uſe, will not make thee a wiſe man.</p>
            <p>Next, a word or two to the women, and then I will conclude: Two ſorts of the Female Sex would I adviſe by all means not to read this Book; <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe women that have made their Husbands Cuckolds, and thoſe that paint their faces. For the firſt ſort, thoſe women that wear Cork-ſhooes,
<pb facs="tcp:36894:4"/>
which makes them to be light-heel'd, let them not dare to touch it, leſt they meet with ſome paſſages in it, which may make them to bluſh as red, as if they had been drinking of burnt-Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret; when they conſider with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that by their doing, and being done, their Husbands, who (had they had honeſt Wives) might have lived and dyed handſome, fine, ſmooth-foreheaded men, now by theſe wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tails are metamorphoſed into ſuch-kinde of Creatures, as Bulls, Oxen, Stags, Rams, Goats, Humble-bees and Snayles.</p>
            <p>Then for thoſe that paint their faces, if they ſhould laugh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into an extraordinary Sweat, it might chance to ſpoil their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions, by reaſon of their <hi>Fucus</hi> melting off; let them therefore for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear, <hi>forewarn'd, forearm'd:</hi> for all other ſorts of women, let them read and welcome, laugh till they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſs

My Lord (ſaid <hi>John</hi>) I was ſworn to ſpeak the truth, and all the truth, and I am reſolved to do it; and ſo went on: <hi>Theſe two Gentlemen asked for a room, and I ſhewed them up into the green Chamber, it was two ſtories high, upon the left hand as ſoon as you are up two pair of Stairs.
