         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis following Epistle being committed to me,
I have found it convenient to disperse it on
this wise to the Churches of Christ, for whose
service chiefly it hath been written as I perceive; and
this being a time, wherein each Friend in God ought
to serve another, and to be a strength and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
one towards another in the Wayes of God,
and therefore according to my duty, wherein I stand
bound to the lord and his Servants, I have diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
endeavoured your benefit and edification in send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this unto you, who accounts it my greatest ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

            <head>To the Beloved Church of God that have believed and
received the Testimony of our Lord Iesus Christ;
The true Light that Lighteth every man that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
into the World.</head>
            <p>IN the Name and Power of our Lord Jesus
Christ blessed for ever, that tender Salutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of my immortal Life is daily abounding
towards, you, who are the true Flock of the
Fathers Love and Care, who hath begotten you
to himself by his Word that lives for ever in us
and with us, that ye should be a People Chosen
and Elected of him unto eternal blessings, and to
be a Praise and an Honour to him throughout
the World, by and through the virtue of his
Life and Power, and in the fruits of his Spirit
brought forth by you all, who are the only Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of that birth which is only the Lords.</p>
            <p>Well dearly Beloved, my heart at this time is
filled in the Fathers Love, with the dear Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of you whom the Lord hath gathered
with his Arm of power, and in his Spirit do I desire
the encrease of all mercies, and peace, and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
unto you, that you may be rich and strong,
and wise and mighty through the Lord Jesus
Christ, and receiving daily of his grace, may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be preserved, constant and faithful in the
heavenly calling unto the end; And forasmuch
as the Lord hath began his glorious work in the
midst of you, and gathered you out of the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and ignorance, and unbelief of this World,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105533:3"/>
where sometime your converse hath been, while
ye knew not the Lord, and raised you up into
the Light, and Power and Wisdome of the Lord
Jesus Christ, having largely tasted of the same
in the experience of his leadings through diverse
Operations and Manifestations of his Spirit, so
that many of you have attained to a good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to peace and rest with the Lord in your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man; Dearly Beloved, seeing it is thus,
these things the Spirit of the Father in me travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to bring forth unto you, for the end to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
you, and to confirm you, and to edifie you in
the saving Truths of the Gospel of peace.</p>
            <p>1. Consider what your former estate hath
been, an estate scattered like sheep without a
Shepherd, some of you dispersed into one false
kind of Profession of Religion, and some into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
walking in such wayes as the Lord led you
not in, but ye were driven from God into the
paths of Death and Darknesse, and were led by
blind Watch-men in the Hypocrisie and false
pretences towards God, honouring him with the
lips while the heart was far away; this was the
condition of some of you, and others of you were
wallowing in the open prophanenesse of the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
World, and such was your estate wherein
you were all strangers to God, and were without
him in the World, and served the Spirit which
leads Captive to Destruction, and in that way
you were strayed even in the separation from
Gods, being in the state of enmity against him,
till the Lord Jesus Christ the good Shepherd of
<hi>Israel</hi> found you out in the estate of darknesse,
and brought you home from your strayed condition,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105533:3"/>
even unto the sence and feeling of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and spirit in you, which called you out of the
wayes of sin and death, and also changed you
and regenerated you into the Inheritance of a
better Kingdome and glory then that which is of
this World, and ye now know Christ Jesus to be
your Shepherd, his Spirit to teach you, his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and Righteousnesse and Sanctification to
dwell in you, being partakers of the same
through the eternal light which once shined in
darknesse, and the darknesse could not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
it, but now it is risen in much glory and
power, and death and darknesse is swallowed up
of life and light, and the fruits thereof subdued;
these things are true and faithful unto many, let
all such rejoyce and be glad in the Lord who
have thus seen his day, and tasted of his power,
and are witnesses that the Kingdome is come
which never fades away.</p>
            <p>2. Consider what the tender dealings of God
towards you, and his gentle leadings have been
since he hath called you out of your former
strayed estate; hath not his light shined upon
your Tabernacle with much clearnesse, perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
your hearts fully of his way and truth? hath
not your hearts often been refreshed, and your
souls truly comforted by the refreshing presence
of the Lord? Hath not the way of life been made
so clear unto you, and the way of your peace so
perfectly discovered, that no occasion hath been
left of unbelief or stumbling unto the upright in
heart? Surely the Lord hath not been wanting
to you in any of these things, but he hath so
reached home by his Word and Spirit to your
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105533:4"/>
Hearts and Consciences with such full convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and perswasions in the wayes of Salvation,
that no sincere heart can doubt or waver con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the things pertaining to his Souls peace
and comfort; for so large and evident hath Gods
Testimony been unto you, ever since he first cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
you by his Grace, that no man having sense
and experience thereof, but must bear witness
that the Lord hath been good, long-suffering,
full of Mercy and Righteousness towards all that
fear him; I am perswaded ye know these things,
and that the tast and virtue of the Lords Mercies
and Power remains stedfast in your remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
and enjoyment, even his Mercies and
loving Kindness that have been made manifest to
you since ye have known the Lord, who hath led
you by the hand as a Father doth his Children,
and carried you in his Arms of Preservation, and
born you on his shoulders in all your afflictions,
insomuch that through his Power and Wisdom
onely, we are yet alive, and the Adversary hath
not prevailed against us, though his attempts
hath often been great to destroy us.</p>
            <p>3. Consider what is now your present state
and standing? How is it with your inward man?
In what life and strength and dominion is he? Is
he strong over all the corruptible, or is he weak
under corruption? Is he in the growth of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
man, of the stature of Christ Jesus? Is he
so begotten and born in you, that life hath swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up death? Hath he victory over the grave,
and doth he reign in you, even the new man, the
spiritual man, the immortal man, Christ in you,
is he come in power and dominion to dwell with
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105533:4"/>
you? Dearly Beloved, mind each Particular in
what state you are, and what is your present
standing to God-wards? Have ye had faith in
God, and love to God, and boldness for God,
and are ye firmly continued therein, or is any
such weakened and decreased in these things?
Is your love grown cold, and your zeal lost, and
your confidence decayed? if it be thus with any,
their present state is not aright before the Lord,
but they must repent &amp; return to their first love,
and return again to the witness of the Spirit of
Christ within them that their strength may be
renewed, for they onely that dwell with the
Lord in faithfulness and abides in Covenant with
him must see his Glory, and be fed daily with
the Bread that comes down from Heaven, and
refreshed with the Fountain of endless Mercies;
if so be ye be perfect with the lord after your
inward man, strong and lively and zealous, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and constant, having a clean heart and a pure
conscience, guiltless and underfiled before God,
this is to be perfect with the Lord, and if ye are
thus, blessed are you; if ye be encreased daily
in the Love and Life of the Father, if your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man grow in the Wisdom and Power and
Knowledge of the Creator, if ye receive the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
of Eternal Life in your selves; If this be
your present state, Oh happy people, who is
like unto you, because ye are saved of the Lord.</p>
            <p>4. What is the present work of God in your
own hearts? Ye must alwayes feel the Word of
God abiding in you, even the Word in the heart;
hear that Word and do it always, and your souls
shall live by the Word of God; that Word beats
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105533:5"/>
down whatsoever tempts and draws from God
which would defile you, and load you Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
and vex the Spirit, for if any obey the
Temptations, they become darkned, unbelief
enters, and the fruites of it grows, and then
there is a falling from the Lord, and a departing
from his way of Salvation; therefore mind the
Power and Spirit of Christ in you, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
and faithful therein, that you may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
unto the finishing of the Work of the
Lord in you, that at last ye may sit down in the
Heavenly places in Christ Jesus, in places of
Peace, and Comfort, and Assurance for ever,
where the Lord is enjoyed all in all, which you
must wait for to be accomplished in you accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Promise, and you must witness the
Work of Christ in you, he must work in you by
his Spirit Regeneration, Reconciliation; Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
Justification, and all good things, for
it is not sufficient to profess that Christ in his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
hath wrought the works of God, but every
one in particular must witness at this day the
work of the Spirit of Christ in his own heart, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the Work of Reconciliation and Salvation,
that ye may in each mans particular receive the
Knowledge and Experience of the Lords Work,
of his Love, and Life, and Salvation, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
in particular; for though never so
large Testimonies in general should be given to
you, or received by you concerning Christ Jesus
and his Salvation, yet the particular feeling of
the Love and Power of God in your own hearts
must you stand by in the Day of Tryal, for that
alone can uphold in the day of Troubles, even
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105533:5"/>
the Testimony of the Spirit of Christ unto Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
felt in each particular heart.</p>
            <p>And seeing the Lord hath brought you to the
knowledge of his truth, so in conversion and rage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
that many can say<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> the Way of the Lord
is so made manifest, that we look not for another,
nor are doubtful of the Way of Eternal Life; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be established stedfast and constant in that way,
not easily moved nor tossed too and fro with men,
nor new Doctrines, nor changeable things, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
your hearts in uprightness before the Lord,
by being faithful to the end, faithful I say to be and
do, according to the measure of Light and Grace
and Knowledge that God hath already committed
to you, that ye may not offend against the Grace of
God, but may glorifie the Lord in your Souls and
Spirits, being joyned in your hearts, and married
to the Living God, and the Lord becomes Your
Husband according to the Promise; but if any be
of a changeable Spirit, such will receive Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and go out of the Covenant of God, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse
the gift of God, if their heart be not meek,
and lowly, and humble, and perfect in the
sight of God, though there may be a tast of the
Love of God, yet there can be no assureance of it if
the heart be not aright before the Lord, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and constant in his Truth; and therefore all
must wait to receive the assurance of Eternal Life
in themselves, even such an assurance of Life, and
Peace, and Joy, and Comfort, that there can be no
departing away, being established in the Heir-ship
never to loose the Crown, Heirs of the power of
God, of his Wisdom, of his Righteousnesse, Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riters
and Possessors of the Eternal Life, that ye
may dwell in the house for ever, not onely as Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105533:6"/>
but as Sons; not onely as such that have
tasted of the Love of God, but as such as are born
Heirs thereof, and must inherit the same for ever.</p>
            <p>now dear Friends, if this were my last unto You,
more then this the Lord hath not to say by me; and
last of all in the Spirit of the Lord Jesus, I charge
all the Saints to he faithful to the Principles and
Doctrines which Ye have heard and received, and
been taught of Christ through his Gospel. Oh be
not inconstant of unfaithful in those Principles
and Doctrines which the Spirit of God hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
your Consciences of the truth of; for if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
are unfaithful, they deny the Lord of Life before
men, and must be denyed of him before the Father;
therefore let us put on strength and courage to be
faithful and constant in life or death, to follow the
Lamb wheresoever he goes, and if we must suffer
for our profession and practice of those truths
which God hath perswaded our Consciences of the
verity of, we shall never be ashamed nor confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before the Adversary, though we gain Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Persecutions, yea death it self for the Name
of the Lord and his Truth, yet we shall obtain the
Crown of Glory which never fades away: and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
all the Sufferings and Afflictions of this present
time, are not worthy to be compared to that weight
of Peace and Comfort, which is and shall be reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
amongst us.</p>
            <p>And as concerning our Obedience to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ever since we were a people, Ye know what
our Principle and Practise in that case hath been,
even to obey all men in all things, either by doing or
suffering, it at any time ye are required to do any
thing by any in Authority which is not agreeing,
but contrary to the Scriptures example of the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105533:6"/>
Saints, and the Spirit of Christ in your own consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
then ye are to suffer whatsoever, if it be death
it self rather then to obey and submit to the doing
of that which is contrary to a good conscience, this
hath ever been our Principle and Practise since we
were a People, agreeing with the practise of the
holy Prophets, Apostles and Martyrs in all ages, who
rather did suffer grievous oppressions and persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
then to obey any command of men in power,
by doing any thing contrary to the testimony of the
Spirit of God in their own particulars; let us all be
like-minded this day, not to do, nor bend, nor be in
any wise contrary to the Spirit of Christ that dwels
in us, but rather suffer whatsoever may be imposed
then to sin against that Light and Knowledge of the
Spirit of Christ which he hath given us, but let us
keep a clean heart and a pure conscience to God-wards,
and therein we shall triumph over all in our
inward Man, though our outward man be afflicted,
and in this we shall have peace and comfort in God
over all our Adversaries.</p>
            <p>And as concerning your meetings, the Lord hath
given you the testimony of his Spirit in you for the
verity and righteousness thereof, though ye should
suffer persecution for the same, yet ye have the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Christ testifying in your hearts that this Way
and Practise of meeting together (as our practise
hath been) is of God, and he Justifies us in the same,
and we have suciffient of assurance by the holy
Spirit to stand faithful in that practise of assembling
together to worship God.</p>
            <p>First, we have the testimony of Scriptures and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Saints in the Apostles daies, to prove this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of Meeting together; The first Christians they
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105533:7"/>
met together in this manner and way as we do now,
they met in private houses, and from house to
house separate and apart from the Publique Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues
and all other Sects; and it is clear that we
have the example of Saints and Scriptures proof for
this our practise of meeting together.</p>
            <p>2. We have our own experience for this diverse
years, how that the Spirit of the Lord hath moved
our hearts to assemble together, and the presence
and power of the Lord Jesus Christ hath been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us, and we have tasted of the goodnesse and
love of the Lord, being so met together, how often
hath the Lord met with us and his countenance shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
upon us, and our souls have been refreshed,
strengthned and comforted in this practise of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together; these things are true, and may confirm
us in this practise of meeting together, and to be
faithful to the end.</p>
            <p>3. We have the full perswasions of the Spirit of
God lively and fervent in our hearts at this moment,
that we ought not to neglect the Assembling of our
selves together, but that God requires it of us, and
it is his will that his people meet together to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
him in Spirit and Truth, separate from all the
world even in one Spirit, and in the Name and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Jesus I hope ye are all like-minded herein, and
that the spirit of Christ perswades your Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in the Truth of that practise, therefore be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
unto God herein, and sin not against the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of Scriptures and example of the first Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
nor against your own experience, nor against
the admonitions of the Servants of the Lord, who
are the first fruits unto God since the Apostacy, and
have again and again in the Name and Spirit of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105533:7"/>
Christ exhorted you to meet together; wherefore
be faithful to perform your duty of God in that
particular whatsoever sufferings should be infflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon you by the men of this world.</p>
            <p>And as concerning refusing to take any Oath, ye
know it hath been our Principle and Practise so to
do since the Lord hath given us knowledge of his
wayes, and the spirit of the Lord that dwels in us,
perswadeth our hearts to deny all swearing, both as
it was practised under the Law, according to the
command of God, &amp; in the types &amp; figures, &amp; as it
is practised among the Christians since the Apostles
daies, which is as now practised, Idolatry and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition;
And I say the Spirit of Christ doth confirm
our hearts in this truth, even to deny all swearing,
and also we have the expresse command of Christ
and of the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> forbiding all swearing by
Heaven and Earth and all other Oaths, which bears
witnesse to the truth of our refusing to swear at this
day; likewise we have the Testimony of many holy
Martyrs and Prophets since the Apostles daies, who
denied to swear on any wise, who suffered for such
their Testimony. All which evidences may justly
confirm the hearts of Gods people at this day faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to hold out their Testimonie of refusing to
swear at all, seeing we have a cloud of witnesses
that testifie with us, the expresse command and Christ
and the Apostle; the Testimonie of diverse holie
men in diverse ages, who suffered for the same, and
the present perswasions of the Spirit of Christ in
our own hearts; All which are sufficient to give
courage and boldness under all sufferings and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
that we may meet withall, for refusing to
swear.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:105533:8"/>
Well Friends, be faithful to God in these and all
other things which God hath given you light and
knowledge in, and I do warn all to keep a clear
conscience, and not to sin against the light and
knowledge, that God hath given you, either by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
to professe and practise that truth which the
Lord hath perswaded your hearts of, or by confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to any thing which ye know is not of the
truth, and this is the way of eternal peace with God;
but if any shall through the temptations of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versarie,
and for the love and fear of this world de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the Lord, and renounce good conscience and be
unfaithful, such must bear the burthen of the Lords
anger because of their back-slidings and revoltings
from the waies of God. True it is, this is a day of
great trial, yet the Lord is strong and gives strength
unto all his people that wait upon him.</p>
            <p>And let us be mindful what our controversie is,
and with whom, this day our controversie is for the
Lord and his truth, to do faithfully and suffer pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
whatsoever the will of the Lord is unto us, &amp;
not to renounce and deny the exercise of our pure
consciences in those things that God hath perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
our hearts of the truth of; For if any this day
should be unfaithful, either by doing what they
should not, or leaving undone what they know they
should do; If any deny the Lord and his truth, and
conform to the false waies &amp; worships of men, such
loses the controversie, and gives the cause of God
into the hand of your enemies, which is a fearful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination,
and the controversie is with that spirit
which opposeth us in these things which we know
are of the Lord. It is with the spirit that we must
contend, contend I say by the spirit of the Father,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105533:8"/>
in long-suffering and patience and good will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
all men, and not with the weapons of this
World in envie to any, even with that spirit which
doth oppose our meeting together to worship God,
and would impose Oaths &amp; things upon us contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to our Consciences; And these things are the main
matters of controversie this day, which the spirit of
Christ in us must oppose, being imposed on us by
the spirit of the world. So all Friends are to mind
to be faithful to the spirit of Christ and its perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and against that spirit which is not of him; for
the opposition is between the two spirits, and none
must say the things required to be forborn or to be
done are but small matters in themselves, and may
be done or not done without offence, this king of
reasoning may be dangerous, and may easily divert
from the obedience of Christ; for we are not to look
so much at the things in themselves which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to be done or to be forborn, as at the spirit
which doth impose upon us in such cases against
pure conscience, if the spirit be not of God we must
not obey it in the least things; for this is indeed the
matter of conscience, not so much particular things
or actions, as the spirit that is not of God, where it
requires things against good conscience, for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
that spirit requireth, be it little or much in
respect of the action, it must not be obeyed and that
for conscience sake, for this is a good conscience
that cannot do nor conform to any thing which the
spirit that is not of God enjoyneth, though there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
suffering be inflicted on the outward man. And
last of all, I do advise and exhort that ye have love
and unity in the spirit of the Lord and one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
that oneness of heart and soul and spirit may
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:105533:9"/>
be amongst us, being bound up in the holy Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of the Father, even willing to do or suffer one
for another, and in this spirit of unity the Lord will
blesse us, and make us strong and able to go thorow
joyfully all our afflictions; but if any strife or divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
be in the bodie, it weakens the whole, if one
member vex another through discord, this is not of
the Father but contrary to him, this is not for the
safetie of the body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but bruises it and woundeth it,
and may more afflict the soul of the righteous then
all outward enemies, and strife and contention ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
out of our own bowels, may sooner work an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow
then all the oppositions that can come
from men. Oh therefore as a Brother to some, and
as a Father to many, and as a Servant to all, let me
entreat and beseech that ye follow those things
which makes for peace, that ye love one another as
Christ has loved you, and that ye be like minded in
all things, even one as the Father and the Son are
one, and so shall the blessings of the Lord never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from you; For dear Friends, the Lord hath
never been wanting unto us, but alwaies near at
hand to fill us with his riches and treasure; and are
not we Vessels of honour, is not his Name in our
fore-heads, are not we the flock of his fold? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let us honour him by the works of truth, of
love, of mercy, and all the works of righteousnesse,
let us bring forth fruits unto the Father, thereby
proving that we are true branches in Christ the
Vine, and let us give up to suffer all things patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the testimony of his Truth written in our
hearts; if we live let it be to him only, and if we die
