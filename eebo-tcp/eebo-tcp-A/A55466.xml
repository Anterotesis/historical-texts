            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface.</head>
            <p>IT is not long ſince this Letter was
writ to me by a <hi>French</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
at my Requeſt, and for my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Satisfaction; who as he is a
Perſon of much Worth and Integrity,
and has been an Eye-witneſs of moſt of
the things whereof he ſpeaks, ſo the
readier Faith and greater Credit ought
to be given to them. But his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
alone need not to be rely'd on for
the Matters of Fact he here relates,
<pb facs="tcp:50245:5"/>
there are thouſands of other <hi>French
Proteſtants,</hi> now in <hi>England,</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
the truth of all; and who having
felt the ſmart of a ſevere Perſecution
in <hi>France,</hi> are fled from thence to
avoid the extream Fury and inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Violence thereof. Now the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable
Evidence I have for the
certainty of what is advanced in the
following Account, and the deſire of
many to ſee it Publiſhed in <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
has made me conſent ſo to expoſe it,
hoping it may give ſome ſeaſonable
Information, and Satisfaction, to our
People.</p>
            <p>For though moſt of them may
have heard much talk of a Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
in <hi>France,</hi> and have Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
and Bountifully contributed
<pb facs="tcp:50245:5"/>
their Charity towards the Relief of
thoſe Miſerable Perſecuted <hi>French
Proteſtants,</hi> who are come hither for
Refuge and Succour, yet I have
reaſon to believe that very few of
them know any thing of the Cruel
manner wherewith the Barbarous and
Inhuman <hi>Papiſts</hi> have purſued that
Perſecution; this is what they will
find ſet down in ſhort, in the little
Relation here preſented to them; and
they may there ſee a Notorious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of the baſe Treachery of
<hi>Popery,</hi> and of the Cruelties which
it holds, as a Point of Religion,
to make <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſuffer; over
whom it pretends to have a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
and Abſolute Dominion. So
this little Hiſtory not being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd
<pb facs="tcp:50245:6"/>
and embarreſſed with nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and tedious Circumſtances, all
ſorts of people may thereby eaſily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
themſelves of this Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as much as we ordinarily
deſire to know of ſuch Events.
And beſides that Charity of our
poor <hi>Perſecuted</hi> Brethren and Fellow
<hi>Proteſtants</hi> makes us concern'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
as being equally Objects of the
Hatred and Oppreſſion of <hi>Popery,</hi>
ſo it may ſerve to prompt us to
ſome Reflections for our own Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt:
<hi>Nam tua res agitur parces
cum proximus ardet.</hi> When our
Neighbours Houſe is on Fire, it
behooves us to take Care of our

the <hi>Rage</hi> and <hi>Fury</hi> of a <hi>Mercileſs

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Cannot but wonder, as well as you, that
no Hiſtory of the Perſecution of the
<hi>French</hi> Proteſtants, has yet appeared in
your Language: 'Tis to be wiſhed it were
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50245:8"/>
well known to all people of the Reformed
Religion, that they might there ſee Popery
in its true Colours, and be taught by that
great Example, to underſtand, that the
promiſes it makes, are but Lyes and Snares,
to deceive the honeſt Faith and good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of other Men. They would there
ſee, likewiſe, how by little and little it
advanceth its Affairs, ſtill ſwearing that it
has no deſign to proceed any further;
and how it, at length, adds Inhumanity to
Perfidiouſneſs, when it has once got to be
uppermoſt: But we had enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
us of the Treacherous and Bloody
Spirit of Popery, without the Hiſtory of
this late Perſecution. The Maſſacre of
the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> ſo often reiterated: The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Maſſacre of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> all over
<hi>Europe,</hi> in the beginning of the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
The Perſecution and Maſſacre of the
<hi>Low-Countries,</hi> under <hi>Philip</hi> the Second:
The Maſſacre of St. <hi>Bartholomew</hi> in <hi>France:</hi>
The Gun-powder Treaſon in <hi>England:</hi> The
Maſſacre of <hi>Ireland:</hi> The laſt Perſecution
of <hi>Hungary;</hi> and the late one of the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50245:8"/>
of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> ſhew ſufficiently, how
that Communion thirſts after the Blood
of men, and is Ingenious in ſatiating it ſelf
therewith, from time to time. However,
Sir, ſince you deſire it, I will here draw
you a ſhort Scheme of that great Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which ought to be an Eternal Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement
to all Proteſtants in the World,
that <hi>Popery</hi> ſpares neither Oaths nor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
to delude them, and ſticks at no
Frauds nor Violences to obliterate them
totally, if it were poſſible, from off the face
the Earth. And this Relation I am now
going to make you, will be ſo much the
more faithful, as that I ſhall ſay nothing
therein, but what my own Eyes have ſeen,
or what I other ways know for certain
Truth.</p>
            <p>The Proteſtants of <hi>France,</hi> liv'd under
the Faith of many Edicts, which promiſed
them Liberty of Conſcience, and equal
Priviledges with the reſt of the <hi>French;</hi>
the moſt conſiderable of their Edicts was
that of <hi>Nantes. Henry</hi> the Fourth, Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father
of His preſent Majeſty, having by
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50245:9"/>
their Aſſiſtance and Fidelity, put an end to
the League which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> had made,
to hinder him from getting into the Throne,
was deſirous to recompence the Blood and
Lives which the <hi>Hugonots</hi> had expended
for his Service; and he did it by that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Edict which gave them the ſame Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
as his other Subjects enjoy'd, and
he granted it to them, and to their Poſterity,
for ever, under the Title of <hi>PERPET<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>AL</hi>
and <hi>IRREVOCABLE;</hi> ſo it was, as a Law of
the State, which was confirm'd by the Kings,
at their coming to the Crown, and has
been expreſsly ſo, by many Edicts of <hi>Lewis</hi>
the 13th, and of <hi>Lewis</hi> the 14th, now
Reigning.</p>
            <p>When this King came to the Crown,
he was very Young; the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>
ſtirr'd up Civil Wars to raviſh it from him,
and the greateſt part of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſided
with him, but the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were all of
a conſtant and uncorrupted Fidelity to
their Soveraign, ſo that they made all the
Prince's Deſigns prove Abortive, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
the Scepter to him that yet bears it.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50245:9"/>
After which, he gave them a publick De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of his acknowledgment, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd
them of his favour and protection,
during his whole Reign; but at the ſame
time that he gave this publick Declaration,
and a thouſand other private ones to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulalar
perſons, he even then began to
form a deſign of ruining thoſe who had
ſaved him: He made reflection, that ſince,
by their means, he had been ſettled in his
Throne, they might, in an other occaſion,
ſhake him out of it; and upon this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
it was that he reſolved to ruine
them, as he has in effect done.</p>
            <p>At firſt, he began with retrenching, by
degrees, all the <hi>Hugonots</hi> from his Houſe,
who had any Imployment therein, and
the which he had given them as a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of their faithful ſervice to him;
inſomuch, that in a ſhort time, there
was not a Souldier in his whole Guards,
but what was of his own Religion: Merit
was no longer conſider'd in their perſons;
he no more advanc'd any of them to the
places of Truſt in the Kingdom; he put
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50245:10"/>
out thoſe he had formerly preferred there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;
and he ſet forth divers Declarations,
prohibiting them all kind of Offices, Arts
and Trades, ſo that none but <hi>Papiſts</hi> could
exerciſe, or profeſs any; by which means,
vaſt numbers of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were reduc'd
to inevitable miſery.</p>
            <p>He took their Colledges and Schools
away from them, ſo that they had no
Maſter of their Religion, to teach their
Children either to Read or Write. When
he had done that, he then ſent Troops of
Miſſionaries into all the Towns, to gain,
as many as they could, by cunning Tricks,
or price of Money; and 'twas a ſtrange
thing to ſee the ſhameful Commerce this
people made, of buying thoſe whom ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
poverty oblig'd to ſell themſelves.
The miſery was ſo great in ſome places,
that they were forc'd to turn Papiſts; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
for ten Crowns, ſometimes for five,
ſometimes for two, ſometimes for a great
deal leſs. Theſe Miſſionaries walk'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
every where, with Baggs of money
in their Hands, and for the ſpace of two
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50245:10"/>
years together, one ſaw hardly any other
Traders ſtirring up and down the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
but theſe Dealers for the Souls of
men, who bought them according to
their Profeſſion, and the number of their
Families.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time, Penſions, or Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were given to thoſe, of any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
who would turn <hi>Papiſts.</hi> The
King, by a Declaration, gave liberty to
Children, at ſeven years of Age, to chooſe
a Religion; and the Fathers of ſuch Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
as became <hi>Papiſts,</hi> were forced to
give them yearly Penſions, and always
more than what they were well able;
by which means they ſeduced abundance
of the younger ſort, bringing mourning
and deſolation into many Families, which
for the moſt part of the time they utterly
ruin'd.</p>
            <p>After this, they forbad their Miniſter
to ſpeak any thing of Controverſie, or of
what paſs'd againſt them; upon which
prohibition, and divers others of the like
nature, they daily made them ſay things
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50245:11"/>
that had never entred into their thoughts:
They hired falſe Witneſſes to depoſe againſt
them, who were often reduc'd to avow
their lying Teſtimonies; and 'twas fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
prov'd too, the Prieſts, and others,
had ſuborn'd them. But as their ruine
was abſolutely ſworn, ſo nothing ſatisfy'd
them; their Eſtates were confiſcated,
their perſons caſt into priſon, baniſh'd, or
condemn'd to ſome other ſhameful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace.
There was no ſafety for any, they
found ways to bring the moſt moderate
into trouble, and eſpecially, to deſtroy
thoſe who were capable of giving ſome
good Example to others.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the degrees of the Deſolations
of this people, and of the tears they have
been made to ſhed for about twenty five
years laſt paſt; during which time, no
body poſſeſs'd in peace what they had,
and every one were in perpetual inquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
for themſelves, and for their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
But theſe were only the beginnings
of their Miſery, and the Eſſays of <hi>Popiſh</hi>
fury and perfidiouſneſs: Whilſt on one
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50245:11"/>
hand they perſecuted ſome, they aſſured
others that the King had no deſign againſt
their Liberty. In almoſt all the Edicts
which His Majeſty ſet forth, he inſerted
ſome Article to lull them aſleep: He ſaid,
that not one Tittle of the Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi>
ſhould be violated: And he inſinuated, that
his intention was only to interdict the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and to ſtop there.</p>
            <p>The Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> having
had the bounty to intercede for them,
the King of <hi>France</hi> gave him an Anſwer,
that is to be ſeen in many of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi>
Writings; by which he aſſur'd His High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
That ſo long as he liv'd, no wrong
ſhould be done to his Subjects of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
Religion; that he acknowledged
them for good ones, and would maintain
them in all their Priviledges. In the mean
time, he had taken from them many of
theſe priviledges; and what is remarkable
at the ſame time that he wrote this Letter
to his Highneſs of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> he in the
very ſelf ſame inſtant cauſed many of
their Temples to be Demoliſh'd, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50245:12"/>
others to be ſhut up; put the Miniſters
into Priſon; oppreſſed private perſons
with heavy Injuſtices; and made thoſe to
mourn bitterly whom he ſaid he would
protect. He began a thing too, which
had never been heard of in any Age, not
even in the Savageſt Nations, or the moſt
remote from Chriſtianity; that is, He
made Children to be taken from their
Fathers and Mothers, and to be put into
Convents, with a ſtrict charge not to
let their Parents ſee them, not excepting
even perſons of the higheſt Birth, and
of Families to which he had obligations
that ought never to have been forgotten
by him. He took away ſeven from the
Duke <hi>de la Force,</hi> an Ancient Duke and
Peer of the Kingdom, the Eldeſt not
being then Twelve Years old. He did
the like by all thoſe of the Count <hi>de
Roy,</hi> whom he had ſome time before per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to go and ſerve the King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi>
in Quality of General of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
In a word, at the ſame time
that he promiſed to protect the <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots,</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:50245:12"/>
he even then did all he could to
ruine them, and there was nothing but
Sighs and Tears amongſt them: One
ſaw every where Souls afflicted to the
very Grave; ſome bewailing the loſs
of their Paſtors and Temples; others
the diſperſion and ruine of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies;
others the carrying away of
their Children; and others trembled
for fear of the ſame, or of greater
Misfortunes. In fine, do but mark
now how far their Fraud and Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
went; that Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> was
Revoked which they had ſo often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd,
and ſo often ſworn ſhould be
inviolably obſerv'd; and this Fence being
quite broke down, all that great peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
was abandon'd to the Rage and Fury
of the Souldiers. But, what is yet more
notorious, to puſh on the Cheat as far as the
fraudulent Wit of Man could carry it,
in the very Act for Ceſſation of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
Edict, this King declared,
that he was deſirous that all people ſhould
live quietly in their Families; and that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50245:13"/>
the Exerciſe of the Proteſtant Religion
being interdicted, every one might live,
in his own Houſe, as he pleas'd. But at
the ſame time that His Majeſty ſolemnly
Swore this promiſe, he ſent his Armies to
ſurprize the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in their Towns and
Houſes, with orders, to Plunder, Burn,
Demoliſh, Beat, and in ſhort, to make
them ſuffer all manner of Evils could be
devis'd, Death only excepted; which in
this circumſtance would have been look'd
on as a great Happineſs. The King Uſurp'd
the Throne of God, and took upon him
the Empire over the Conſcience; and in
his Name whole Towns were ſummon'd,
by puiſſant Armies, to turn <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and
upon refuſal, they were abandon'd to
pillage and ruine, and to the ſame Fury
as Enemy Towns are wont to be when
taken by Storm. They ſeiz'd on all the
Avenues, and brought back thoſe to the
perſecutors, who had eſcaped out of
their hands: They beat, ranſack'd, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
and made this people ſuffer a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Evils, without diſtinction either of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50245:13"/>
Age, Sex, or Quality, from the oldeſt
to the youngeſt, Male and Female, Noble,
or Ignoble, all were equally at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
of the Souldiers: Blaſphemies,
Impieties and Blows, were the Arguments
of this Infernal Miſſion; and one may
ſay, without exaggeration, that Hell ſeem'd
to be let looſe, and that the Devils were
come to Preach up <hi>Popery</hi> on the Earth.
Alas! Who can reckon the Tears were
ſhed in this ſad occaſion? God alone
knows their number, who doubtleſs has
counted and gather'd them all into his
Boſom. The Air ecchoed every where
with grievous Lamentations; and I think,
nothing more pittiful could be heard, than
the Crys and Groans of this people, whilſt
they were in the hands of their tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</p>
            <p>They dragg'd many of theſe poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
into the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Churches by the Feet,
by the hair of the Head, or by Ropes tied
about their Necks; they hang'd them up
at the tops of Rooms, or out of the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
by their Heels, or by their Hands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:50245:14"/>
they plung'd them into deep Wells, and
ſtinking Mires, with Toads and Serpents,
where they left them according to the
time of their Conſtancy; they lighted
great Fires, and Roaſted ſome till they
had changed their Religion; if their
patience was longer than the Cruelty of
their Perſecutors, then they baſted their
Naked Legs with ſcalding Greaſe, or boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Oyl. Others they made to hold red
hot Coals in their Hands; burnt the ſoals
of their Feet; tore the Hair from their
Beards, and the Nails from their Fingers,
and Toes by the very Roots; larded
their fleſh all over with Pins, and thraſh'd
them with Sticks till they left them for
Dead. If they were Sick, they beat Drums,
and ſounded Trumpets, Night and Day,
in their Ears, for 'twas a general Rule to
hinder them from ſleeping, and to ſet
them in different Poſtures; ſometimes
ſtanding upon one Leg, holding up a
Hand in the Air; ſometimes down on
their Knees, doing the like, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If they
changed Poſtures, through wearineſs, then
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50245:14"/>
they pinch'd and cudgell'd them till they
were Black and Blue. Sometimes they
tied all the people of a Family in a Room
together, and in ſight of one another,
they beat and bruis'd the Men, and made
the Women ſuffer a thouſand indignities.
They would often carry them ſeparately
into Chambers, to torment them, but ſo
as they might hear each others crys; and
every one in ſuffering, ſuffer'd for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and for the reſt of their Family,
which they either ſaw in torments, or
heard the crys thereof. In ſhort, let any
man but fancy to himſelf, what vaſt
numbers of Soulders, brutal, and let looſe,
are capable to invent and act in all manner
of miſchief and cruelty, and he will have
an Idea of the method whereby the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi>
of <hi>France</hi> have been taught to
become <hi>Papiſts. O Tempora! O Mores!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This great Fury made thoſe that could
ſave themſelves, fly into the Woods,
Mountains and Caves; they wandred in
the Fields, expoſed to all the injuries of
the Air, not having wherewith to live, or
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50245:15"/>
to cover themſelves; and not daring to
ſtir but in the Night, for fear of falling
into the hands of their Enemies, Old and
Young, Men and Women, all wandred
in the Deſarts; and all theſe were but
ſome Members of ſad Families, Fathers
without Children, and Children without
Fathers; Wives without their Husbands,
and Husbands without their Wives; a
doleful ſpectacle, no doubt, to the Eyes
of Men. But this is not all, the fury
was ſo exceſſive that the Sea-Ports were
every where ſhut for to hinder their flight,
and above 100000 Souldiers imployed
to ſtop their paſſage on the Frontiers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
all the Peaſants whom they had made,
and the Prieſts enjoyn'd, to take up Arms
againſt them; ſo that it was by great
good Providence, if any could ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
amidſt ſo many Obſtacles: And I
don't believe there was one in forty but
what was taken, after having gone, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
two or three hundred Leagues,
with all ſort of miſery and difficulty. The
Priſons were all full of theſe poor Fugitives,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50245:15"/>
and if any of them had ever changed their
Religion before, they were ſent to the
Galleys; a puniſhment in <hi>France,</hi> more
Ignominious and Cruel than any Death.
One ſaw every where, in the Provinces,
the Chains of theſe Confeſſors, which
they dragg'd along from one end of the
Kingdom to the other: <hi>Tantaene Animis
coeleſtibus irae.</hi> The Women were Shav'd,
and carry'd away to Convents; nor were
they put in there many times, till they
had firſt been at the mercy of certain peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
worſe than the very Dragoons, and
who made them ſuffer things that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty
and civility permit me not to name:
I ſhall only ſay that they ſhut ſeveral of
them up for many months together, with
Murderers and Highway Men, and ſuch
like Cattle. Some were caſt into deep
Dungeons where they never ſaw day-light,
and they cloath'd them with filthy Raggs,
taken from the noiſom Carkaſes of Dead
perſons, which they ſtripp'd before their
Faces. But the height of all Evils, and
that which had never entred into the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50245:16"/>
heart of the wickedeſt of all the men
Hiſtory tells us of, was the ſending whole
Veſſels full of them to the New World,
to be ſold to the Savages there; Men and
Women, Young and Old, Noble or others,
all were treated equally alike.</p>
            <p>In ſome places they made Aſſemblies to
pray to God, and there the Dragoons
Maſſacred all they could light on, burnt
the Houſes to which the Fugitives retir'd,
and thoſe poor creatures with them. Some
they hang'd up on Trees, and others they
precipitated from the tops of high Rocks,
and they broke thoſe on the Wheel, limb
after limb, whom they called the heads
of theſe Aſſemblies. But it would be end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
to particularize all the various Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and unheard of Cruelties, which
the <hi>Papiſts</hi> practic'd upon the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in
<hi>France,</hi> for to force them to abjure their
Religion: I will only ſay, that they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
them to all the exceſs of Fury and
Inhumanity that the Devils themſelves
were capable to inſpire. So that conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Perſecution in all its circumſtances,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50245:16"/>
it may well be reckon'd the greateſt and
blackeſt that ever was amongſt Chriſtians
in any Age.</p>
            <p>After they had in this manner diſperſed
ſo many Families, ruined ſo many Houſes,
made ſo many Tears to be ſhed, and caus'd
a general Deſolation, they at length made
a publick Spectacle and Divertiſement
thereof. The Kings Players Acted for
many months together in <hi>Paris,</hi> a Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
call'd, <hi>Merlin Dragoon;</hi> in which the
Perſecutors and the Perſecuted were the
Perſons Repreſented, and the Court and
People went in Crowds to laugh and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
themſelves, at the Oppreſſions and
Torments which the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd;
and by this, as well as the reſt,
you may judge what ſhare Piety had in
that VVork.</p>
            <p>Now, though all theſe Frauds, Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
and Cruelties, and infinite numbers
more have been acted towards the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi>
of <hi>France,</hi> in the face of the Sun, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Millions of Eye-witneſſes, and are
known to the greateſt part of <hi>Europe;</hi> yet
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50245:17"/>
ſome are ſo unreaſonably incredulous, that
they will not be perſwaded there has been
any Perſecution in that Kingdom; and
others have been ſo diſingeniouſly confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
as to maintain in their Oral and
printed Diſcourſes, that there has been
none. Amongſt theſe latter, is the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Meaux,</hi> Monſieur <hi>Varillas,</hi> Father
<hi>Thomaſin,</hi> Monſieur <hi>Brueis, &amp;c.</hi> perſons
of great Parts and Learning, though of
very little Candour and Integrity. Nor
indeed, is it any wonder to find ſuch Sons
and Champions of <hi>Popery,</hi> deficient in
thoſe laudable and Chriſtian Virtues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſince
'tis very difficult, nay, almoſt impoſſible,
for a man to be of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church,
and not have his Principles Vitiated, and
his Morals Depraved by her; ſo different
are the Maxims and Doctrines ſhe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes,
from thoſe which our Saviour
teacheth us in his Holy Goſpel. But
that which the Ingenious Author of the
Apolog. Hiſt. urges, to prove the truth
of the late Perſecution againſt the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions
of Monſieur <hi>Brueis,</hi> and the reſt,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50245:17"/>
ſeems ſufficient to convince the unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judic'd
World of the reality thereof,
and to invalidate thoſe Gentlemens Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
and all other whatſoever to the
contrary.</p>
            <p>Above two hundred thouſand perſons,<note place="margin">

ſays he, of both Sexes, of all Ages, and
of all conditions, the greateſt part of
which lived very well, at their eaſe, in
their own Houſes, and many of them
poſſeſs'd rich Inheritances, conſiderable
Imploys, fair Revenues, ſome to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of three and four thouſand pounds
<hi>per Annum.</hi> Theſe, ſays he, have left
all, and are moſt of them gone out of
<hi>France,</hi> in a manner, quite Naked. They
have not only quitted their Houſes and
Eſtates, abandon'd their Country, their
Friends, their Parents, Relations of all
kinds, thoſe that were neareſt and dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
to them; they have broke all the
ties of Nature and Conſanguinity, and
of the moſt tender Affection; they
have ſeparated, if I may ſo ſay, from
a part of themſelves, from their own
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50245:18"/>
Bowels. In this cruel ſeparation, they
have gone away from all they had moſt
near and dear to them in the World, at
the price of their Liberties and their
Lives. They have done it to go and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in unknown Countries, in Climates
extreamly different from thoſe where
they had receiv'd their Births, without
having any thing certain, without hoping
for any other ſubſiſtance there, than what
they could gather from the charity of
ſtrangers. If this be not the effect of a
violent Perſecution, what is then that mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
which has got into the minds of all,
and made them take ſo unparellell'd a
Reſolution? How has this Fury commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
it ſelf to ſo many people of all ſorts,
who lived very far aſunder, and who had
never known, or ſeen one another? How
has it gain'd, in ſo ſhort a time, all the
Provinces of ſo great a Kingdom as <hi>France</hi>
is, and in thoſe Provinces, almoſt all who
were, or had been of the Reform'd Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

and think of it, I may with truth affirm,
that above two hundred thouſand of
the Kings moſt faithful Subjects have
voluntarily Baniſhed themſelves from his
Kingdom to fly the Perſecution; not to
ſpeak of many thouſand others, perſons,
ſome of which have been condemned to
the laſt puniſhments by the Judges; others
have been Maſſacred by the Souldiers;
others have died in the Galleys, others
have been ſhut up in Convents; and
others been embark'd and ſent for <hi>America.</hi>
New Declarations more ſevere than the
former are daily publiſh'd; freſh Orders
are given for the Guard of the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers;
the new Converts are forc'd, with
greater rigour than ever, to go to Maſs,
to Confeſs, and to receive the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
They continue to fill the Convents,
Priſons and Galleys with Confeſſors;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50245:19"/>
and they empty them from time to
time by new Embarkments for <hi>America.</hi>
There where the Aſſemblies continue,
there they continue to Maſſacre them.
The Dragoons perform their Miſſion
with the ſame Zeal ſtill; and the Judges
ceaſe not giving the ſame ſights to
the people of Bodies drawn about on
Sledges, and caſt Dead upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
