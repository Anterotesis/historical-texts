            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Joshua xxiv. 15.</bibl>
               <q>And if it seem evil unto you, to serve the Lord, choose you this day whom you will serve, whether the gods which your Fathers ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that were on the other side of the Flood, or the gods of the <hi>Amorites</hi> in whose Land ye dwell; but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THESE are the Words of <hi>Joshua,</hi> which he spake to the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> after (by the Providence and Blessing of God) he had setled them in the Land of Promise. He had gathered all the Tribes of <hi>Israel</hi> together at
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106355:4"/>
               <hi>Shechem, and called for the Elders of Israel, and for their Heads, and for their Judges, and for their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,</hi> and they presented themselves before God; and there did he recite unto them the Benefits which God had done unto them and to their Forefathers, the Wonders which he did in the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the fearful Things by the Red Sea; how he had preserved them in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, delivered them out of the hand of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, <hi>given them a Land which they did not labour for, Cities which they built not, Vineyards and Olive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards which they planted not:</hi> And from thence he takes an occasion to exhort them to fear the Lord, and to serve him in sincerity and truth, <hi>and to put away the gods which their Fathers served on the other side the Flood, and in</hi> Egypt, <hi>and to serve the Lord only, the onely true God;</hi> and then, saith he, in the Verse of my Text, <hi>If it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose you this day whom you will serve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By which manner of expression, we must not conceive that it was his intention to leave it as an indifferent matter, whether they served God or not, or thereby to free them from the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they already lay under of serving the Lord only; but rather that it was his Design by these words, to try and to prove their Inclinations and Affections towards the Almighty, and to induce
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106355:4"/>
them by a wise and a deliberate Consideration, to a Resolution of serving the Lord only; and to bind them the more strictly to his Service, as having of their own free will chosen him to be their God. The Service of God is a reasonable Service; he would have men consult their own Reason, and consider what they do, and wisely and seriously to make choice of him.</p>
            <p>This it seems <hi>Joshua</hi> himself had done, and by his own Example would excite the People to do the like; for he acquaints them with his own Choice and Resolution upon the Matter: For <hi>as for me</hi> (saith he) <hi>and my house we will serve the Lord;</hi> and a brave and a noble Resolution it was, that although all others by a base Rebellion should Apostatise from God, although they should choose them other Lords, and make to themselves other Gods, whilst others put themselves under the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of wild Passions and vile Affections, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving divers Lusts and Pleasures; yet he with his whole Family would serve the onely true God, the great Creator and Lord of Heaven and Earth: And what was his Resolution at that time should be ours now; for we have the same God to serve that he had, and the same and yet far greater Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to induce us to it.</p>
            <p>And that which makes his Example the more
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106355:5"/>
remarkable, and the more inforcing is this, that he was a soveraign Prince and Commander in chief of all the Hosts of <hi>Israel,</hi> and yet neither the Charms nor the Troubles, neither the Pleasures nor the Cares, with which so high a Station is usually attended, could keep him off from a vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous prosecution of the great business of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and of the true Service of God. And when such as he, when Princes and noble Persons, when rich and great Men make an open profession of serving God, when they make it their choice and their delight, and their business, what an excite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and encouragement must it be to inferiour people to do the like?</p>
            <p>And indeed the Duty of serving God is so just, and so reasonable, the Obligations and Motives to it so many and so weighty, that if we seriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the matter, it will appear to be the wisest and the best choice that we can make.</p>
            <p>In discoursing therefore upon this excellent Subject, I shall endeavour through God's assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance briefly to do these <hi>Two</hi> Things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <hi>I.</hi> To shew what it is to serve God; and</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>II.</hi> To shew what Obligations and Motives there are that can induce a man to resolve so to do.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:106355:5"/>
And may that great and good God whom we serve, give such a Blessing upon what I shall now say, as that his <hi>Name</hi> may be thereby glorified, and our selves advantaged!</p>
            <p n="1">I. Now then as for the <hi>First</hi> of These, <hi>to serve God,</hi> is not only to <hi>profess God's true Religion,</hi> but <hi>to live according to it,</hi> and to behave our selves in such a course and way of living, whilst we are in this World, as may evidence the sense we have of the great Majesty of God, and of his Soveraignty over us. This in general is the meaning of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God as it is taken in the largest sense, and in the full extent; for I shall not confine it to any one particular part of Piety, but look upon it as it takes in the whole compass of Religion; and that we may the better understand when we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve this Duty, and when we decline from it, I shall shew how we may serve God, in what things God may be served by us, and what are the proper Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications of That Service.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>First</hi> then, We serve God by obeying his Commands, and by executing his Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, in those things which he requires of us. For Obedience to the Commands of God, is one great part, nay the first, the very chief and principal part of that Service which we owe him, and which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106355:6"/>
he, who is resolved to serve God acceptably, must be sure to mind; without This our Service of him is very lame and imperfect, or rather in truth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all. There can be no better proof of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice than Obedience; <hi>Know ye not,</hi> saith <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 16. Ephes. 6. 5.</note> St. <hi>Paul, that to whom ye yield your selves servants to obey, his servants you are whom you obey?</hi> And it is his Advice, that <hi>Servants should be obedient to their Masters:</hi> and therefore if we would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove our selves the true Servants of God, we must heartily and sincerely endeavour to obey all his Commands, whether they be against our present Inclinations and worldly Interest or not. With what chearfulness did the Servant of the <hi>Centurion</hi> in the Gospel conform himself to the Commands of his Lord; who, if he did but say <hi>Do this,</hi> went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly, without any more adoe, about it? And should not we then testifie our Subjection to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, and make as full proof of our being his Servants, by yielding as great a deference to his Injunctions? With what readiness do Men usually obey the Commands of their Masters, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Flesh, even sometimes in wicked and unrighteous Actions? And should not we then as readily obey the Commands of the great Majesty of Heaven, who commands us nothing but what is just and reasonable; nothing but what
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106355:6"/>
tends to our present and future Happiness? If mortal and sinful Men expect entire Obedience from their Dependants, upon the account only of their own bare Word; how much more reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably may the Eternal and Righteous God lay claim unto, and expect the like Obedience from all of us? If we pretend to be his Servants, Him we must obey without dispute; the least intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of whose Commands (none of which can be any other than holy, and just and good) is a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Warrant for our immediate Compliance with them. And what those Commands of his are, he hath so plainly, and so fully revealed and declared in the Holy Scriptures, that it must be our own fault if we are ignorant of them; but then we must withal remember what our Blessed Lord hath told us, That <hi>he that knoweth his master's will, and doth it not,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luke 12. 47.</note> 
               <hi>shall be beaten with many stripes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Commands of God are such as enjoyn some things to be done, or forbid us the doing of others; and if we would serve him as we ought do, we must have a special regard to all these; we must take care to perform all those things which he positively commands, and decline from all those things which he expresly forbids; he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to be <hi>holy as he is holy,</hi> to be temperate
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106355:7"/>
and chaste, charitable and kind, upright and just in all our Dealings; and he forbids Intemperance and Luxury, Sensuality and Pride, and all kind of Uncharitableness and Injustice one to another.</p>
            <p>In a word, he commands us, <hi>that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Tit. 2. 12.</note> 
               <hi>soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world.</hi> These are the Divine Sanctions and Edicts which <hi>are good and profitable unto men,</hi> which tend to the Welfare and Happiness of Mankind, and which He, our great Lord and Master, doth expect and require should be observed and obeyed by us. And how then do they approve themselves to be his Servants, that all along go contrary to these his just and equal Commands? How can they hope to enter into their Master's Joy? What can they expect hereafter, but that they shall be cast, with all such wicked and evil Servans, into That place of <hi>utter darkness, where there is weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) <hi>Secondly,</hi> We may serve God, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting his Glory and Honour in the World, and by shewing, upon all occasions, a zealous and a prudent regard for it. An honest and good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, that loves his Master, will be ready to do such things as may tend to his Honour, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Credit; he will preserve and support his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106355:7"/>
esteem so far as it is in his power, and endeavour to vindicate and assert it when he finds it is assaulted. No less should the Servants of the Almighty God be concern'd for his Honour, yea rather much more, inasmuch as his Honour is far to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and ought to be dearer unto us, than that of any mortal Man: and therefore if we be resolved to serve God, and to approve our selves unto him his true and faithful Servants, we must make the Advancement and Preservation of his Glory a great part of our care. We should endeavour to promote his Glory and Honour in all Places, and among all Persons we converse with. To the doing of which we have several ways and means that may conduce very much, and we may meet with divers Occasions and Opportunities for it, which, without great Blame to our selves, and wrong to God, we cannot pass by, or let slip from us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their due Improvement. To this end,</p>
            <p>We should embrace and lay hold of, or rather, we should look for and seek out all fit Times and proper Occasions of speaking ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably of him, publishing and declaring his noble Acts, and praising him with our lips, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his excellent Greatness; extolling and magnifying his holy Name, for the great Works of Creation and Providence, for his admirable Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106355:8"/>
in contriving the Means of our Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for his great Mercies and Blessings at any time conferred upon us; ascribing all happy E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, and prosperous Successes to his Goodness only, and rendring him all Praise and Glory for the same.</p>
            <p>We should testifie our Dependence upon him, and our Acknowledgment of his Dominion and Power, by entirely submitting our selves to his blessed Will, humbly expressing our Content and Satisfaction with our Allowances and Provisions, those wages, which he, as our Master, affords <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s, as knowing him to be Lord of all; patiently also en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during all Afflictions and Crosses, those Corrections and Punishments which he shall think fit to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict upon us, as knowing that they come from him; in all such Cases being ready to say with good old <hi>Eli, It is the Lord, let him doe what seem eth him good;</hi> or rather with our blessed Saviour, <hi>not my will but thine be done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We should use with especial Respect all things peculiarly relating unto God; such as are the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, which deliver to us the Word of God; the Holy Sacraments, which convey to us the Grace of God; the Holy Places of God's Publick Worship, those Places where his Honour dwelleth, together with whatever else is dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106355:8"/>
and set apart for the peculiar Service of God. These we should never prophane, speak ill of, or misuse; it doth not become those who make profession of <hi>Serving God,</hi> to use these things any otherwise than with very great Esteem and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, because the Honour of God is very much concerned in the right, or ill Use of them.</p>
            <p>And that we may be happy Instruments of glorifying <hi>God,</hi> and of causing him to be glorified and honoured by all Persons, we should heartily endeavour to promote the sincere Practice of P<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>y and Religion in the World; for nothing can more naturally tend to <hi>God</hi>'s Glory than That. 'Tis the universal Practice of Piety, and the sincere Profession of <hi>God</hi>'s true Religion, that will make his Name venerable, and cause it to be blessed and reverenced among Men; when Men are emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently good and vertuous, regulating their Lives and Actions according to the Laws of <hi>God,</hi> they thereby make it manifest, That they reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence his Authority, which enacted them; that they admire his Wisdome, which contrived them; that they dread his Justice, which can punish Men for the neglect of them. There is a kind of Lustre and Brightness in the Works of Piety and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, done with a good Conscience, and in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to <hi>God</hi>'s Commands, which cannot but at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:106355:9"/>
the Eyes, and captivate the Hearts of all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders; which will make them clearly discern, and openly acknowledge the great Excellency, the awful Majesty, the admirable Wisdome of our Law-giver, will consequently induce them to magnifie and praise him. The Practice therefore of Piety and Religion, if we resolve to serve <hi>God,</hi> we should endeavour to advance and propagate, by the best and the wisest means that we can, by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenancing Vice and Prophaneness, by encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging Vertue and Holiness, by removing Mens Prejudices against it, by recommending it to the Minds of Men from its great Worth and Loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, its general Usefulness, its absolute Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, its solid Comfort and Peace, which it brings to the Souls and Consciences of Men: but chiefly by practising it our selves, and shewing a good Example; for the World is very much led and guided by Example; and when Men see others, especially their Betters and Superious, to be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely religious and good, Men fearing God, and serving him; they will be apt to endeavour to be so too.</p>
            <p>Those Talents also with which God hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted us, (our Wit, and Reason, and natural good Parts); and those temporal Blessings which he hath confer'd upon us, (our Wealth, our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106355:9"/>
and Authority); we should make use of and improve for the Advancement of God's Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; in setting forth the Praises of God, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting Works of Charity, and doing good, in bringing Religion into Credit and Esteem with Men.</p>
            <p>And as we should studiously and industriously endeavour to promote the Glory of God our selves, so we should express our just Grief and Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when others do contrary unto it; and, so far as we can, we should vindicate and assert it, and not patiently suffer the least Affront done unto Him; otherwise we do but falsly usurp the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of his Servants, and become more like Deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of him.</p>
            <p>Now by these ways and means we may emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently set forth God's Glory, procure many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes to him, and Worshippers of him; and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Religion, in the Eyes of all Men, very lovely and acceptable: in doing of which we do really and truly serve God, and God will accept of and own us for his Servants.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) <hi>Thirdly,</hi> God may be served by us, by our being diligent and faithful in our several Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and Employments. For the whole World is but, in a manner, one great Family, wherein God, the great Master of it, hath placed us all, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106355:10"/>
to his good Pleasure, assigning unto eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one some particular Employment; and he that with Diligence, and Industry, and Faithfulness doth his Duty, in That state of Life in which God hath placed him, doth therein serve God: and although some are placed in an higher Sphere, and made more capable of serving God than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are; yet all of us were design'd by our wise Master for some kind of work, though it be in an inferiour Order, that so no room should be left for Idleness in the World; and though some have a nearer relation to God's Service than others, and, by reason of the nature of their Calling, are more usually and properly honoured with the Title of <hi>God's Servants,</hi> (such as are all <hi>chief Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> and <hi>Magistrates,</hi> and the <hi>Ministers of God's Holy Word</hi> and <hi>Sacraments,</hi> both which sort of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are emphatically called the <hi>Servants of God;</hi> those in governing and protecting, these in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and instructing the People): yet every ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and lawful Employment doth give a Man a Title to That Honour too. And what Calling or Profession soever a Man be of, whether it be honourable or ignoble in outward Appearance, yet if he do but prosecute his Business (provided that it be a lawful Business) industriously and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently and faithfully, according to the Rules of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106355:10"/>
Christian Prudence, with Sobriety and Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he is even then about the <hi>Service of God,</hi> although he seems most busie about his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns. But,</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The last thing which I shall mention, wherein God may be served by us, is a Religious Worshipping of him, which consists in putting up our fervent Prayers to him, and hearty Praises of him; supplicating his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Grace, deprecating his Wrath and Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, calling upon his Holy Name, and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively reading or hearing his Holy Word; and that not only publickly, when we are in the House of God, but privately also, when we are secluded from Company: and all this is to be done in the most humble and devout posture; the bending of our Knees, the bowing of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, the lifting up of our Hands and Eyes, and the like; which are the most proper Acts whereof God's outward Worship doth consist, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we testifie our inward Acknowledgment of that Great and most Adorable Majesty which we come to worship. The doing of all which, doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of its self bear the Name of <hi>God's Service;</hi> and indeed we cannot be truly said to serve him, whilst we wilfully neglect, or are very deficient in this Duty; and he that never, or perhaps but
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106355:11"/>
seldom, doth thus worship the Lord his Maker, he that is so intent upon his worldly Concerns, as that he cannot, or will not allow himself some time for the Publick and Private Worship of God, doth not in truth <hi>serve GOD,</hi> but <hi>Mammon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in these <hi>Particulars</hi> doth the Duty of <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God</hi> chiefly consist; which, that it may be the more acceptable unto him, should be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with such Qualifications as these;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> With <hi>Reverence,</hi> for we should continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally carry about with us such an awful Sense and Apprehension of him, as to make us walk hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly with him; such honourable and worthy Thoughts, as are suitable to the Eminency of his State, to his Divine Perfections, to all his wise Works and Actions; such as are due unto, and befitting the Majesty of so holy, so pure, and so glorious a God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> With <hi>Godly Fear,</hi> not a servile or a slavish Fear, such as the Devils and all wicked Men have (for in that respect we should serve God without Fear) but a Fear which proceeds from a Love of him, and a Desire to please him, such a Fear as makes us dread nothing more than to offend and displease him. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> With <hi>Gladness,</hi> and <hi>Chearfulness of heart,</hi> for it doth not become the <hi>Servants</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> (the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106355:11"/>
greatest and the best of Masters, <hi>whose Service is perfect Freedom)</hi> to do his Business, and to go about his Work, with heavy and mournful Hearts, as if they served a cruel and austere Master; but rather with all the Chearfulness and Alacrity that they can. And <hi>God</hi> himself, in several pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in his Holy Word, hath exhorted us to <hi>rejoice,</hi> to <hi>be glad,</hi> to <hi>delight our selves in him,</hi> making it thereby sufficiently evident, that to serve him with <hi>Gladness</hi> and <hi>Chearfulness of Heart</hi> is agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his Will, so as that we may <hi>serve God,</hi> and <hi>be chearful</hi> too.</p>
            <p>And thus having shewn what it is to serve God, wherein That Duty doth consist, and what are the proper qualifications of it, I come now to</p>
            <p n="2">II. The <hi>second thing</hi> which I proposed to do, and that was, to shew <hi>what those obligations and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives are that may induce us to resolve to serve him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) And first I shall begin with That which <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua</hi> made use of as an Argument to engage the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> to the service of God, and that is the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the goodness of God and of those Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings and benefits which we receive from him. And it is certainly a very enforcing Argument that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries weight, and strength, and reason along with it. The consideration of the Mercy, of the Favour,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106355:12"/>
of the goodness of God, must needs be accounted a great motive to do him service, and cannot but be very prevalent with those that have any inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity or sense of gratitude in them. For who but he that is a stupid ungrateful Man, will kick and spurn at his best Friend, will refuse to do him any service, will not use his best endeavours to fulfil the will and pleasure of such a Benefactor as hath done him the greatest Kindnesses; and is still able and ready to do him more?</p>
            <p>Now the Benefits and Blessings which our most merciful God hath confer'd upon Mankind, are many and great. We owe our Life and our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Being to him; all this great and beautiful World, and all the Comforts and Conveniencies we enjoy in it, proceed solely from his Goodness. There is nothing that we have, which may be for the Pleasure and Content, as well as for the Help and Support of Man, which comes not most libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally from him. We all live upon his Provisions, and are sustain'd by his Mercy, and preserved by his Bounty. The air wherein we breathe, the ground whereon we tread, the comfortable influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Sun, the Moon and the Stars, all the Happiness which we now have, or may hope for hereafter; all these are the Effects of his great love to us. Every where we meet with sensible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106355:12"/>
of his Kindness, in every moment of our Lives we have great pledges of his Goodness towards us; nay (That which is the greatest En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearment of all, and which aloud proclaims his Love and Favour to the Sons of Men) he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven his only Son to die for us. And now what shall we <hi>render unto the Lord for all the benefits he hath done unto us?</hi> He requires our Service, and we shall be vilely ungrateful if we yield it not unto him. Shall we repay all his Goodness with disrespect to him, or disregard of him? shall we slight his Commands, and be disobedient unto his Will, or turn our backs upon him, and refuse to do him Service? If we thus requite the Lord, may we not be truly called in the Language of <hi>Moses, Foolish people and unwise?</hi> O let us in the abundance of the Mercies we injoy look up to Almighty God the great Author of them; and let the repeated acts of his Goodness and Bounty prevail with us to do him Service! The Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God extendeth it self to all the Corners of the Earth, who dispenseth the temporal Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings and Comforts of this Life (although not equally, yet) so universally and justly, as that he that has least of them has enough to oblige him to serve God faithfully all the days of his Life. But then, as for those that have a greater share of the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106355:13"/>
Blessings and Mercies of God, they that have an affluence of these Worldly goods, what an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement do they lie under to this duty? When God extendeth his bountiful hand in affording us an abundance of good things, so far as to add su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities to the necessities of nature; This lays still a greater obligation upon us to do him service. He therefore whom God hath raised to an higher degree in Wealth and Honour than other Men, is infinitely bound for the plentiful accommodations and comforts of his Life, to be more diligent and faithful in serving God, and to employ all the Advantages of his State to advance the Honour of his munificent Benefactour, to whose good Providence alone he doth owe them, from whose Goodness only he receives them.</p>
            <p>But we should not only consider our own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Blessings, but those also which God hath conferred on the Publick, obliging thereby every particular Member thereof to a dutiful Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance towards him; for we should not be so narrow-spirited, as to respect only our own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Advantages, but should withal regard those of the Publick, of which every Man is a Part; and (if it be not through his own Demerit) may partake of the Happiness and Prosperity of it. And among all the many Mercies, with which
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106355:13"/>
God hath blessed this Nation, certainly it ought not to be accounted one of the least considerable, That at present we enjoy the great blessing of Peace amongst our selves at home, although we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in a just War with our Enemies abroad. And if we consider that there are a great many who would willingly disturb this our Peace, but through the good Providence of God are withheld from doing it, and that we are not exposed to those Miseries and Devastations under which our Neighbouring Countries do groan, which are now made the Seat of the War; if we call to mind the many Providential and Wonderful Deliverances we have had from the restless but fruitless Endeavours of our Enemies to subvert and ruin us; In a word, if we reflect upon the happiness we have, in enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the freedom of our Laws, together with all our just Rights and Privileges, whether we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the Mercies of the past, or of the present Age, we cannot but thankfully acknowledge, that the goodness of God hath been great towards us; and if the consideration of these things cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with us to serve him in truth, and with all our hearts, how righteous a Controversy with us hath, not only his Justice, but, his very Grace and Mercy?</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) But farther, we have another Obligation and a strong Motive to serve God, arising from the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106355:14"/>
consideration of the Divine Perfections those glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Attributes which reside in the Divine Nature, and whereby he hath been pleas'd to make himself known to us, the which do demand the Observance of this Duty from us, and are of themselves per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasives sufficient enough to excite Men to it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they receive good or evil at his hands. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God should not exert his goodness in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring External Blessings upon us, although he should withhold even good things from us, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict on us evils, as great as were those of <hi>Job,</hi> yet he is infinitely worthy of all the service that either Men or Angels can do unto him. His absolute, and entire, and compleat Perfections, do indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sably require it of us, and all that we can do in ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him, is but of right due unto him. For he is a God (and there is none else beside him) of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Majesty, Power and Might, of Infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Justice and Mercy, Righteousness and Truth. <hi>He is That high and lofty one that inhabiteth Eternity, whose name is Holy;</hi> He ruleth all things both in Heaven and Earth, and governs the World by an Infinite Wisdom and Infinite Goodness; his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty is so Wonderful, that the Angels themselves in Presence of it do hide their Faces, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils for fear of it do shake and tremble. And what kind of persons then are they, that in Contemplation of so Excellent and so Glorious a Being, can refuse to serve him with their utmost Power?</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:106355:14"/>
(3.) Besides we should consider that we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to this Duty by the Example of all the rest of our Fellow-Creatures; who, if we should be neglectful of it, or deficient in it, might all upbraid us for it. For do we not see, how all the Creatures of the World, all the Works of God, though never so much void of Sense and Reason, do bear their parts in serving the Author of their Being; inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they prosecute the design for which he made them? And if we Men, whom God hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd with Reason and Judgment, whom he hath every way qualified and made fit for his Service; if we should not have a share in this high and most important Work, how justly might our Stupidity be reproved by their Subjection?</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) We should also further consider, what just Right and Title God Almighty hath to our best ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices. We are or should be his Servants by Right of Creation, for <hi>He hath made us, and not we our selves;</hi> by Right of Purchace and Redemption, for he hath bought us and redeemed us, not <hi>with corruptible things, as silver and gold, but with the precious Blood of Christ;</hi> by Right of Conquest and Deliverance; for God, by sending his Son to die for us, conquer'd <hi>Sin,</hi> and <hi>Satan,</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> and hath delivered us out of their Power and Rage; that <hi>we, being delivered such Enemies, might serve him without fear in Holiness and Righteousness before him all the days of our life.</hi> He
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:106355:15"/>
therefore having such and so great Right, and so many, and so strong Titles to our Service, how can we with-hold it from him? If we are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to give <hi>unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's,</hi> why should we not give <hi>unto God</hi> what doth so justly belong unto him? In not doing of which we shall be unjust and sacrilegious in the highest degree.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) To this we may also add that it is an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable thing to serve God, the best and the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest Employment, That which is the proper work of reason, That wherein consisteth the greatest Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and from whence doth redound the truest Glory that the Sons of Men can be capable of. 'Tis not a service which we need be ashamed of, or blush to own, or seek to decline, but rather such as we have the greatest reason in the World to be glad and proud of. 'Tis an Employment that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobles Heaven, and wherein the Angels themselves do rejoice and glory.</p>
            <p>The wisest and the best of Men, have all along esteem'd it a great title of Honour to be stiled the Servants of God. St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Titus</hi> calls himself the <hi>Servant of God;</hi> and the Epistle of St. <hi>James</hi> begins thus, <hi>James the servant of God;</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> who was a great Prince, and a Ruler un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God of all the Tribes of <hi>Israel,</hi> hath this honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Character given of him (as also <hi>Joshua</hi> his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106355:15"/>
Successor had) <hi>that he was the servant of the Lord,</hi> and (that I may mention no more of this kind) <hi>David</hi> himself, who was an Anointed King, in many places of the Book of <hi>Psalms,</hi> makes mention of his being the <hi>servant of God,</hi> as a matter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his greatest Glory and Renown did consist.</p>
            <p>Indeed 'tis That which adds a Lustre and a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Crowns of Princes, and makes them shine with the greater Brightness; 'tis That which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanceth the poor Man to an high Degree in the Love and Favour of God, and which adorns and beautifies the Soul, more than all the external Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendages of State and Grandeur, without it, can set off, or advantage the Body: 'tis That only which can make the rich Men truly honourable, and gain them the truest Esteem and Veneration. <hi>Them that honour me</hi> (saith God) <hi>I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.</hi> To serve God, is to honour him; and they that do so shall be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd by him: not to serve God, is to despise him; and they that do so shall be rejected of him. Honour and Esteem, both with God and Men, do constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attend the Observance of this Duty; Disreputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and <hi>everlasting Contempt</hi> are the natural Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of neglecting it.</p>
            <p>Being therefore that all Men are naturally desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of Honour, being nothing can be a greater Honour to us, than to be employ'd in the Service of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106355:16"/>
God, why should not this be one good Motive to induce a Man to resolve to serve him?</p>
            <p n="6">(6.) And then we should consider farther, in the <hi>last place,</hi> that our State, in this World, is not of a very long continuance; our Life is upon the wing, and every moment hasting to its Period; every day that we live, we draw nearer to our End; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Instances of Mortality we meet with, which may put us in mind of our Death. But then what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of us in the other World, if our Life be not spent in the Service of God in this? We are sure that we shall not be eternally extinct, like the Beasts that perish, we shall not cease to have a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, even when we are departed hence, but we shall assuredly live either in Eternal Misery, or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Happiness; and there is no way for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding the one or obtaining the other, than by serving God whilst we are on this side the Grave. If we serve Sin, the wages we shall reap there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by (besides the terrours of an afflicted Conscience) will be Eternal Death, That will be our Misery; <hi>but if, being made free from sin, we become the servants of God, we shall have our fruit unto holiness, and, the end,</hi> (besides the comforts of a good Conscience) <hi>everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life,</hi> (Rom. 6. 22.) that will be our Happiness and our everlasting Reward. This whosoever doth seriously consider, he must be egregiously stupid and senseless, if he prefers not the Service of God
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106355:16"/>
to all the vain Pleasures and Enjoyments of the World, and chuseth rather to serve him faithfully whilst he lives here, than, by neglecting so to do, to run the hazard of being eternally miserable here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. We know not how soon we may die, and go into another World; and we shall be very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, if we take not care that our portion may be amongst the Blessed, even in those happy Mansions above, where all the true Servants of God enjoy ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-fading Felicity, and reap those Pleasures which are at God's right hand, and endure for evermore.</p>
            <p>And thus, from these few Considerations (many more I might alledge, but from these few) we may sufficiently discern what great Motives and Reasons there are, that may perswade us to this Duty of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God. There may perhaps be such unreasonable Persons, who, like those in the Prophet <hi>Malachi,</hi> speak against the Lord with <hi>stout words,</hi> and either say openly with their mouths, or think secretly in their hearts, that <hi>it is in vain to serve God, and what profit</hi> is it, <hi>that we have kept his ordinances?</hi> (Mal. 3. 13, 14.) or with those wicked Men in <hi>Job, What is the Almighty, that we should serve him, and what profit shall we have if we pray unto him?</hi> (Job 21. 14, 15.) But ah, mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably deluded Men! how do they speak? How do they think, without all Truth and Reason? For never any Man did truly serve God, who was not a great Gainer thereby, either in this World, or in the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:106355:17"/>
other, which is far better. Wherefore whatever the sentiments of wicked Men may be, whatever may befal us in the World upon This account, let us take up a firm Resolution with <hi>Joshua,</hi> and put That Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution into practice, <hi>of serving, honouring, and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Almighty Lord that made us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that we may be the better enabled to serve him as we ought to do, it is very necessary that we should daily have recourse unto him for a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual supply of his Grace and Holy Spirit, which we are infallibly assured he will not deny to those that humbly crave it of him, and we must for the sake of our ever-blessed Redeemer, <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> beg God's Acceptance of our Persons and our Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. But then, when we have done all that we can in serving him, we must beware that we boast not of it, nor pride our selves upon that account, for we are still but <hi>unprofitable Servants;</hi> and we must be so far from taking to our selves the praise of any thing that we do, that we should give Praise and Glory to God only, who hath given such power unto Men to serve and glorifie him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now unto The King Eternal, Immortal, Invisible, the only Wise God, be Honour and Glory for ever and ever. Amen.</hi>
