         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

those are these, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Saint <hi>Paulus plague</hi> is the first, yea, and one of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiest,
&amp; that is, when a man hath neuer a penny in his pursse,
c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

how many poore people will lye languishing of this disease? how
many that haue bowling Alleys, nay, how many that walke in
the middle Ile of <hi>Paules</hi> in reasonable good cloathes, will bee
strucke with this plague? it is hardex to reckon them, then to
reckon vp the Uertúes of a woman which are without end.</p>
                  <p>2. Saint <hi>Chads</hi> plague is next, and that is, when a man
that trauels hath a long iourney, a tyred horse, and little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney:
this plague threatens many poore Yorkeshire Clyents,
and, vnlesse they keepe it off with their hooks, some welchmen.</p>
                  <p>3. Saints <hi>Benets</hi> plague is the third, &amp; that is, colde-cheare,
hot words, and a Scoulding wife: many Coblers wil be subiect
to this disease, but not lye long for it, but euerie day be of the
mending hand, marry it is thought their wiues will prooue
worse and worse.</p>
                  <p>4. Saint <hi>Magnus</hi> plague is next, but not altogether so
dangerous as the former, and that is, when a man is rich, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyes
it but a while, and leau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s a foole behinde him to spend it:
It is doubted that some rich Cittizens and others cannot
escape this plague.</p>
                  <p>5. Saint <hi>Tronions</hi> plague steps into the fift place, and that
is when a man is olde in yeares, yet a childe in discretion: when
his wife is a drunkard, and his daughter a Wanton, and his
Seruant a pilferer, this plague is expected to fall vpon brokers,
their bodies being subiect to much infection, and their conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to corruption, So that tis thought Lord haue Mercy vpon

and that people who loue themselues, will shun those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

                        </gap>s</hi> plague is likely to be verie hot, and that
is, when a Maideis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

troubled with the greene sicknes, and longs for a husband, yet
nobody woes her. This plague of all the rest, though it will
spred far, yet will it prooue so mortall, because those that shal be
strucke with it, haue a tricke to help themselues.</p>
                  <p>7. The wiues plague followes in the seau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that is, when a woman has a husband y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> is very poor, yet Iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
yong, yet a hastie foole. Seruingmens wiues is thought
will die of this disease or if not dye yet lye for it a long time.</p>
                  <p>8. The Blacke plague is when a man hath much to pay,
little to spend, and an vnmercifull Creditor: this blacke plague
will flye ouer into the Low-countries, and sorely trouble our
English Souldiers, who feede vppon prouant, and take more
care how to wipe of Oes in chalke, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to winne a towne from
the enemy.</p>
                  <p>9. The Fryers plague, is no holy Plague, but a hollowe
plague, and that is when a man sees or smels good cheare, has
an excellent stomacke, but knowes not how to get it: if any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine

                  <p>10. The deuils Plague is one of the moste damned plagues
of all, and that is, when a man is marryed to a wanton, must
be beholden to his enemie, yet dares not be reuenged. The to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
of this plague will stand thicke vpon a number of young

discentions, mutinies, rebellions, battailes, combats, and

but doubting that I put your hearts out of their right places
already with too much horrour and affrightment, héere doe

                  <p>The comfort men haue in a time when victuals grow
déere or scant, is either to be well furnished, or else to haue the
gift of abstinence, and to be content with little: Now because
flesh is a great preseruer of mans life, I will shew you one
Stratagem how you may get much into your owne hands,
how to vse it when you haue it, and how to refraine from

                  <p>IN the Cittie of <hi>Caliz</hi> (being an Iland bordering &amp; belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the kingdome of Spaine) ther was built a Colledge
of Fryers, amongst whom there was one lusty Church-man
aboue the rest, who was better limmed then learned, &amp; could
better skill in composing an amorous sonnet then in soing so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
dirges. This Fryer notwithstanding bare such a holy
shew, was so demure in his manners, and so couertly cloaked
his holinesse, that he was supposed the holiest fryer of all the
fraternity, and therfore was appointed a confessor to a nunry,
that was famous in this Iland, for women of most seuere
forme of life &amp; godly conuersation. Under the iurisdiction of
the Abbesse, there were some twenty Nuns, all young, lusty,
and full of fauour: very deuout, and yet not such recluses, but
they had eies as other seculer women had, to iudge of beauty,
and hearts to wish wanton thoughts, which after grew to
light (as time is the discouerer of most hidden secrets:) for it so
fel out, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst these holy she saints, that one was either more
wise or more wanton then the rest, called <hi>Madona barbadora,</hi>
issued of good parentage, and only daughter, though not only
child to <hi>Signieur Peagnes Bontolus,</hi> a man of great reputation
in the Citie of <hi>Caliz.</hi> This <hi>Barbadora</hi> comming oftentimes
to be confessed of this fryer, whose name was Father <hi>Pedro
Ragazoni,</hi> noted that he was a man of comely personage, &amp; so
began somwhat fauourably to conceit of him: til at length fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<hi>Pedro</hi> marking her glances, perceiued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be amorous,
&amp; with that hearing her sigh sundry times (ere he had confest
her) did straight imagin that either she was a great sinner, &amp;
déeply repentant, or else sore ouer laden w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maidens plague,
(which is ouer large chastitie) and therfore so full of outward
sorrow &amp; contrition: the frier taking her one day by the hand
as she was alone with him in a pew, wisht her to vncouer her
face. <hi>Barbadora</hi> obeying her'ghostly fathers command, threw
off her vaile &amp; blusht, which Fryer <hi>Pedro</hi> espying, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

The Fryer hearing the Nunne in so good a minde whisperd
in her eare, but what I cannot tel, but I am sure hée applyed
<pb facs="tcp:25320:18"/>
such plaisters to help her, that shée complained no more of the
plague a long time after.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Barbadora</hi> being thus set frée from her often sighes, could
not kéepe her owne counsell, but shée reuealed it vnto her bed-fellow
(for the closet of a womans thoughts hangs at her
tongues end) in such sort discourst the conceit of her cure vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her, that <hi>Iulia</hi> longed for the confessing day, (for so was the
Nuns bedfellow called) which being once come, and shée in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
with Fryer <hi>Pedro,</hi> after hée had questioned her of many
sinnes, and giuen much deuout and holy counsaile, at last shée
burst forth into plaine tearmes, and told him shée was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with the same sicknesse her bed-fellow <hi>Barbadora</hi> was,
and therfore craued the like assistance at his hands. The Frier
smiling at this, was content to play the Surgeon to cure this
plague, stil vnder the color of auricular confession, shadowing
his villany, till of twenty Nuns, fiftéene were with childe.</p>
                  <p>At last time began to babble, and the Nuns bellies to grow
big, so that before thrée moneths were past, they began to féele
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> for the ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of their plague, they had a spice of Timpany
not long after, the world was quick, that the Nuns grew big,
and to be briefe, they feard their fellows should perceiue their
fault, and so bewray it to the Abbesse, wherupon with a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
consent they all agréed at their next confession to bewray it
to the fryer, which was not long before it hapned. So <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora</hi>
cunningly dissembling the matter, being formost of the
rest, because she was eldest and of greatest account with the
Abbesse, came to confession. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fryer <hi>Pedro</hi> began with
many a smiling looke, and holy kisse to gréet her, and question
her about her sinnes, fetching a great sigh, made him this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere.
Deuout father, to make a rehearsall of my sinnes is
folly; to tell what particular offences haue scapt from me is
néedlesse, because in one briefe word, as he that sinnes in one
of the ten commandements breakes all, so shée that by Frier
is gotten with Childe, hath blemisht all her other vertues.
And sir, therefore I confesse héere that my belly is bigge, and
your swéete sugery hath wrought it, so eyther you must

bestirre your wits to helpe now at a pinch, or else your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit
will be as great as my dishonour. The Fryer although
this motion had greatly amazed him, yet he would not shew it
in countenance, least he might discourage his faire Lemman,
but bad her be of good chéere, and not to feare, for he would be
charie of her honor and credit, and salue what was a misse to

they parted, she promising to bring her word within ten daies
how her phisicke had taken effect: well, to be short, merrily goes
this good wife home, and findes her husband dallying with her

                     <p>The Rope-maker (this gentle <hi>Richard</hi>) pondering at his

for his labor, and with that he fell vppon her, and pumnield
her so soundly, that he had almost kild her, and she began
halfe to repent that she followed the olde womans counsaile,
yet hoping for time to reuenge, she bare all things with the
more patience, and finding oportunitie vppon a day or two af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

him, and to performe whatsoeuer should redound to her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie,
auowing such secrecie, as that it should neuer come

                     <p>Time passing on thus, it fortuned that our Rope-maker,
and his maide, were wont euery weeke twice, to goe to a

and his maide going alone to this solitarie place, to make their

told him from point to point what had hapned to him,

therefore desiring all them that were present to pray for
