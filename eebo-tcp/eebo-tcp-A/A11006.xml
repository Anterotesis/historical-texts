         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The time was immediatelie before his <hi>Paſsion</hi>: for after that by his owne example, in waſhing his Diſciples feete, he had recommended vnto them Humilitie, as a vertue most ſingular and beſeeming a Christian; hee vttereth theſe wordes, partlie in the time of the Supper, and partlie after the Supper. And wee knowe, that the ſpeaches of men, which immediatelie preceede death, as they proceede of a moste holie and Heauenlie diſpoſition, (for then all affections are layde aſide, nature reuiueth, and reaſon getteth place, then moſte wiſelie the ſoule reſolueth concerning its owne eſtate and condition, then hee teſtifieth moſt plainlie his will towardes his Children, his Seruantes, his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and other Friendes whatſoeuer,) ſo are they thought worthie to bee moſte attentiuelie heard, most carefullie receiued, and moſt deeplie kept in memorie. If wee conſider the manner, ſeeing the holie Spirit taketh more paines, and is more plentifull and copious in penning heereof, than of anie other <hi>Sermone</hi> whatſoeuer, hee would haue vs to knowe howe precious a Iewell they are, and howe highlie wee ought to account of them: For if wee ſearch all the Records of the LORDES <hi>Sermons</hi> in the New Testament, wee ſhall finde none ſo particularlie and fullie ſet downe in regiſter, as this is. Laſtlie, if wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the matter, it is full of manifolde Heauenlie conſolations. It is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, ſundrie times before, the LORD in his <hi>Sermons</hi> hath comforted his Apoſtles, and all penitent ſinners: but in no place at ſo great length, and with ſuch varietie of Heauenlie conſolations: For heere at length hee meeteth and re-encountereth almoſt with euerie griefe, ſcandale, and particular temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation that exerciſed and aſſailed their ſoules. They were ſadde and ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, when they heard that hee was to leaue the worlde, and to aſcende vnto the Father. Hee meeteth this, by bidding them belieue in him, and fayth in him ſhould ſupplie his bodilie abſence: and hee telleth, that the ende wherefore hee aſcended, was to prepare a place for them, that where he was, there they might bee alſo. It was a griefe to them, that they ſhould want ſuch a comfortable Guide, who alwayes directed and conducted them. This hee meeteth, by telling them, that hee would not leaue them comfortleſſe, but hee would giue them his Holie Spirit. They feared, that they ſhould bee depriued of manifolde conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
<pb facs="tcp:16631:3"/>
which they found in his preſence. This hee meeteth, by aſſuring them that howbeit in the worlde they ſhould finde trouble, yet in the middeſt of trouble hee ſhould giue and leaue them that peace that the worlde ſhould not take from them: and if they belieue in him, as the Vine-tree furniſheth the Branches, ſo hee ſhould furniſhe vnto them ſolide and manifolde conſolations, and make them to bring foorth fruite aboundantlie. And to the intent that they might haue the better warrand to looke and exſpect for thoſe graces in him, as hee chargeth them by fayth to haue vnion with him, ſo hee chargeth them by loue to haue communion amongst themſelues. The troubles and croſſes that were to befall them in the worlde for CHRISTES ſake, after his departure, might haue wonderfullie diſcouraged them, and brangled their fayth. This hee meeteth, partlie by fore-warning them before they came to paſſe, and partlie by exhorting them to patience, and partlie by ſetting downe manie argumentes to eſtabliſh them, Hee telleth them, that the worlde ſhould hate them, perſecute them, excommunicate them, and put them to death. Hee comforteth them, partlie becauſe hee hath fore-warned them, and partlie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had done ſo to him who was their Lord and Maſter, and partlie for the goodneſſe of the cauſe, becauſe it was for his Names ſake. Againe, hee knew it would bee no ſmall temptation vnto them, to ſee his ſhamefull and ignominious handling, to ſee him, who was their Lord, to bee ſo wonderfullie humbled, to ſee him taken, and bound by wicked and profane men, to ſee him made a ſpectacle of deriſion, firſt in the Hall of <hi>Annas,</hi> and thereafter of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>japhas,</hi> to ſee all ſortes and rankes of people crie out againſt him, to ſee him at laſt to bee condemned and ignominiouſlie crucified: hee knewe that this temptation would bee ſo ſtrong, and ſo vehement to brangle their fayth, that at the laſt all ſhould bee offended in him, and ſhould flee away from him, and leaue him. Of this hee fore-warneth them, and furniſheth conſolation vnto them, notwithſtanding of their foule fall.</p>
            <p>Now againe, if yee looke to the <hi>Prayer,</hi> it is wonderous Heauenlie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable: For after that as a Prophet hee hath inſtructed the people, and the Apoſtles, nowe before (as an high Prieſt) hee offer vp his owne bodie vpon the Croſſe, for the ſinnes of the worlde, hee prayeth moſt earneſtlie for himſelfe, for his Apoſtles, and for them who ſhould belieue through their Miniſterie. For himſelfe, That the Father would nowe glorifie the Sonne, when hee is going out of the worlde. For his Apoſtles, That the Father would alwayes haue a car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of them whome hee left in the worlde behinde him. And thirdlie, for all them that through the Miniſterie of the Apoſtles ſhould bee liuing to the ende of the worlde, That the Lord would bleſſe them, and by his prouidence guarde them. And ſo both the matter of the <hi>Sermone</hi> and <hi>Prayer</hi> is wonderous excellent, and in them both wee may ſee, not onelie Diuine knowledge, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing
<pb facs="tcp:16631:4"/>
and fore-telling thoſe thinges that were to come to paſſe, which, if hee had beene onelie man, hee could neuer haue done; but alſo a loue vnſpeakable, and more than wonderfull, in that when the wrath of God was perſuing him for the ſinnes of the Elect, when the bitter Cuppe of the Paſſion was to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pined vnto him, when the terroures of Death were nowe before his eyes, when Sathan, and all the power of darkneſſe, was nowe to aſſaile him, when all rankes of men were to raile vpon him, and all his owne were to bee offended at him, when <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould denie him, <hi>Herode</hi> ſhould mocke him, <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> ſhould condemne him, in a manner, hee was forgetfull of all thoſe thinges that ſhould come to himſelfe, and mindfull alwayes to offer joye and conſolation vnto his owne.</p>
            <p>Nowe this matter ſo excellent, haue manie learned and godlie men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortablie and fruitfullie handeled, and amongst the rest, that famous and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie Minister of Ieſus Christ, in the Kirke of <hi>EDINBVRGH,</hi> M. <hi>ROBERT ROLLOK,</hi> of happie memorie, for his painfull and comfortable trauels therein, and for his manifolde other graces, deſerueth to bee prayſed with the first: For hee was a man whom God beautified with manie rare gifts and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and whome the Lord made manie wayes to bee ſteadable to his Kirke: his vntimelie death, when the Lord first called him, did manie lament, and when their teares were ſpent, they entertained dolour and griefe in their heartes: Yea, euen nowe the faythfull, ſeriouſlie conſidering theſe dayes of decaye, (wherein that <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> rabble ſet themſelues to ſmoare the Trueth, and to bring in darkneſſe againe: and wherein by ſome, Religion is mocked, and diſdained, and ſome are content with a bare ſhowe and outward profeſſion, without power and vigour thereof, and a life anſwering therevnto) are compelled to ſigh for the great wound and loſſe that the Kirke ſuffered, as in the death of manie others, ſo namelie in the death of that most faythfull man of GOD. Through his death this <hi>Citie</hi> lost a good Citizen, the Flocke a good Pastor, the Colledge a good Rector, his Brethren a faythfull Fellow-labourer, wandering ſinners a wiſe guide, and in a worde, what ſorte of people found not ſome loſſe, and had not their intereſſe in his death? Who was more carefull than hee to haue GOD glorified? Who walked more carefullie with GOD? Who was more crucified to the worlde? Who was more ſeuered from all entangling worldlie pleaſures, and commodities? Who more had their conuerſation in Heauen? Who more carefull to gaine ſoules to the Kingdome of GOD, publicklie and priuatelie, by voyce and by penne, by worde and by writ, at home and abroade, aliue and dead? And his conuerſation was ſo anſw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the CHAPTER immediately going before (Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren) the LORD fore-warned his Diſciples of his departure, and taking away of his bodily preſence out of the world: that moued his Diſciples excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly; for they had no will hee ſhould goe from them: Therefore the Lord in this, and in the next two CHAPT. continueth in ſpeaking to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, to comfort and confirme them after his departure, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of his bodily preſence from them. And in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this CHAPTER hee layeth downe the propoſition of this comfort: <hi>Let not your heart bee troubled</hi>: Thereafter hee ſubjoyneth ſure argumentes to comfort, ſtrengthen, an I confirme them when hee ſhould goe away: Hee ſaith, Let not your hearts be troubled: knowing well, that when hee ſhould depart, they ſhould be like as many Lambs among Wolues in the middeſt of this wicked world; and ſo they would be troubled in mind when he ſhould go away: therefore the LORD warneth them before his departure, that their hearts ſhould not be troubled. The Diſciples faile in this, that they thought that if the LORD had taken away his body, and ſhould abſent himſelfe out of their eyes, they ſhould haue no more comfort nor grace of him. Ye ſee the Leſſon ariſeth here of their example: As the preſence of the LORD IESVS<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> miniſtreth joye, peace, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd tranquillitie to the heart of the ſinner, euen ſo when he draweth away his preſence from a ſinner, from a miſerable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:16631:6"/>
then there is no joye, no comfort, no peace, no reſt to the heart. It may be indeed, and it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth oft to paſſe, that men and women will be lullud vp in a carnall ſecurity, deliting themſelues in the vain pleaſures &amp; comforts of this world, in eating and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, &amp;c. It may be, ſome be occupied, they will haue a quite life, they will lie downe, and ſleepe quietly, they will riſe, and be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton: but in very trueth, they haue no true peace, if they finde not the Lord Ieſus preſent in their heart when they lie downe, and when they riſe: howbeit they had all the worlde, they haue no peace: (<hi>No peace to the wicked,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>Eſay.</hi> 57.21.) Howbeit they ſeeme to haue peace, they haue none: As for the godly, that haue once founde his preſence, and haue once taſted of that joye which is in his face, of that light which commeth from his face, and once he be taken from them, giue them all this world, and all the pleaſures of this worlde, they ſhall haue no pleaſure, they will neuer bee blythe, till they get a ſight of their Lord, their ſoule dieth without his face: and when he commeth againe, it quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and liueth. This is the true joye: thinke neuer yee haue true reſt without the countenance of the Lord, without the which all the pleaſures and comforts of the world are but vaine: for all ſhall leaue you, and ye with them ſhall periſh. No queſtion the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, when they began to feele that joye which they founde in his preſence, rather than they had wanted his company, they would haue wanted all the world.</p>
            <p>Now when he hath ſet downe this propoſition of comfort, hee leaueth them not ſo: but knowing well, how harde a thing it was to a comfortleſſe heart, to receiue comfort, he ſubjoyneth ſundrie arguments and reaſons, to hold them in a good courage and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: And firſt he saith, <hi>Yee belieue in God, belieue alſo in mee.</hi> There is an argument wherefore they ſhould not bee troubled: The firſt comfort hee miniſtreth to their comfortleſſe heartes, is Fayth in Chriſt: The meaning is, Howbeit when I goe away, yee ſhall not ſee me, yet ſettle your hearts vpon me, follow me with the eye of your ſoule, and looke afarre off to the Heauen, and looke that ye reſt and repoſe vpon mee by a true and liuely faith. Well then, yee ſee the firſt remedie againſt the taking away of the Lorde Ieſus, and withdrawing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f his bodily preſence, is faith in him: howbeit he were neuer ſo farre away, let thy ſoule goe thorow the clouds and take holde on the Lord Ieſus, where hee ſitteth at the right hand of God his Father: ſticke till him, bee ſure of him, gripe him
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:16631:6"/>
by the hand of faith, and then in the middeſt of all the confuſions of this world, which ye ſee now fall out in theſe latter dayes, thou ſhalt get comfort and eaſe to thy ſoule, and it ſhall bee holden vp among all troubles of this world: For why, this is the nature of faith in Chriſt, it will make things abſent to be preſent: As the Apoſtle ſaith to the <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. It maketh things hoped for, to be preſent with vs: it will let thee ſee that felicity, that life, that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, which is laide vp in the Heauens for thee, which we cannot ſee with the eyes of our mortall bodies, ſo long as we are here: Then ſo long as thou art abſent from him, belieue in him, that thou maye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t finde euer comfort, till thy faith bee turned in ſight: and then thou ſhalt find, that both ſight of the ſoule, &amp; the ſight of the body, into the Heauens, ſhall be perfected: then we ſhall ſee that clearly, which we ſaw before obſcurely: and wee ſhall ſee him no ſooner, but our joy ſhall be full, and wee ſhall bee into his glory with him: and as his face ſhineth, ſo ſhall ours ſhine alſo. So ye ſee, the chiefe thing that holdeth vs vp in all troubles of this world, is the blinke we haue of Chriſt by faith.</p>
            <p>Nowe hee proponeth not this argument barely, but by way of compariſon: for he ſaith, as <hi>Ye belieue in God, ſo belieue in me</hi>: for as he ſaid, I and the Father am one: howbeit the Father and the Sonne be ſundry perſons, yet they are but one bleſſed Majeſty, one God, in one nature, and one ſubſtance: faith in one of them, prejudgeth not another: as thou belieueſt in the Father, ſo belieue in the Son, ſo belieue in the holy Ghoſt, becauſe they are one in nature and ſubſtance: they are coeſſentiall, coequall, &amp; coeternall: if the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Sonne were different in ſubſtance, ſo that the Father were one God, and the Sonne another, then in very deede faith in the one, would prejudge the other: for why, faith in the heart can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not leane on two things, or vpon two Gods, or three. So that we note here, that faith muſt bee on one thing only: if thou wilt put thy truſt in any thing in this worlde, on riches, or honour, &amp;c. it ſhall paſſe thy power to belieue in God: if thou make many Gods, it ſhall paſſe thy power to put thy truſt in them all: and it were no more but this, that faith muſt be grounded on one only, it is a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient argument to beare thee witneſſe, that there is but one God in ſubſtance, the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt: So it is no preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to the Father, that wee belieue in the Sonne: yea, I ſay more, there is no fayth in the Father, but thorowe the Sonne: And if thy fayth reach not thorow the Sonne, and thorow the nature
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:16631:7"/>
of man in him, it ſhall paſſe thy power to belieue in the Father; for God dwelleth in a light without acceſſe: no creature can come there: no, not the Angels, without the Sonne: there is no ſight of that Majeſtie, but in the Sonne, the LORD IESVS. Men trowes, the Iewes trowes, to get a ſight of that Father, and to pierce the cloudes without the Sonne: No, there is no ſight of him without Chriſt Ieſus, and him crucified: for in him only ſhineth the glorie, juſtice, mercy, and power of his Father; becauſe he is the Image of the Father and the in-grauen forme of his perſon. So, wouldeſt thou belieue in God, thou muſt paſſe thorow the Sonne to the Father. This is the trueth: ſearch and ſee, if it can bee poſsible to thee to get any grip of God, or if thou canſt get any joy, without Ieſus: No, thou canſt not: but when thou apprehendeſt Ieſus Chriſt, thou pierceſt in to that light, and taſteſt of that joye. This is the way to belieue in God.</p>
            <p>The next argument he vſeth to comfort them when hee ſhould depart, is this, <hi>Jn my Fathers Houſe are many dwelling places: if it were not ſo, I would haue tolde you</hi>: I would not lie to you: and now, ſaith he, <hi>I goe to prepare a place for you</hi>: As though the Lord would ſay, Be not troubled at my departure; for why, my departure is for your weale: my departure is to prepare a place in Heauen for you: and if I go not before you, ye can haue no place there intill. There was neuer yet ſince the beginning of the world, and since the fall of Adam, man, or woman, that euer entered into Heauen, or ſhall enter there, and get a place there, but by the vertue of the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Ieſus Chriſt: The Fathers, Adam, Abraham, Iſaac, and Iaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kob, neuer one of them entered into Heauen, but by vertue of his Aſcenſion: and neuer one ſhall enter at that great day, but by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his Aſcenſion. Looke how we ſhould belieue that Article of our <hi>Creede,</hi> the Aſcenſion of the Lord Ieſus. Before the Lord Ieſus came into the world, in the nature of man, all the Fathers, that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued before him, from the beginning of the worlde, after they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted this life, came to Heauen onely by vertue of the Aſcenſion of Chriſt. It is true, their ſoules went to Heauen immediately: the ſoules of Abraham, Iſaac, and Iaakob, went to Heauen immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie: But how? By the vertue of Ieſus Chriſt, that was to come in the fleſh, and by the vertue of his Aſcenſion that was to come. What euer the good they got, they got it all thorow him that was to come: their ſoules went vp to the Heauen by fayth in him that was to come: As for vs, who liue now in this worlde, after his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:16631:7"/>
neuer one of vs goeth to Heauen, or ſeeth him, or get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth any place in Heauen, but by vertue of his glorious Aſcenſion, paſt already; as the Fathers got entry into Heauen, by vertue of his Aſcenſion to come: What euer grace hath bene, and what euer ſhall come into the world, all hath bene thorow Ieſus Chriſt. There is a difference here to be vnderstood, betwixt the meaſure of grace the Fathers got before the Aſcenſion, and the grace wee get now ſince the manifeſtation of Ieſus Chriſt: Wee haue a great vantage of theſe Fathers; all the grace they got, was by vertue of Chriſt to come: but wee get grace by vertue of Chriſt already come: The vertue of him before his comming, was not ſo great as it was at his comming, and after he paſſed vp to Heauen. Why ſhould wee haue ſuch a benefite, and not knowe it? Albeit the ſoules of mea went vp to Heauen before his comming, yet not ſo many as nowe goe ſince hee came, and ſince hee hath taken place in Heauen him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: before there were but few got entry into Heauen: there was but a little doore of Heauen open, the great multitude got not entry there: Therefore the Apoſtle (<hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.8.) ſaieth, So long as that olde Tabernacle ſtoode, the waye to the Sanctuary was not open: But nowe, what grace, what mercy is ſhowne to vs, that are borne ſince the comming of Chriſt, if wee get a ſight of him? But woe to vs, if we belieue not! The vertue of his comming into the world, hath a thouſand times greater force to open Heauen, than of before: Nowe all the yates of Heauen, ſince hee aſcended, ſtand wide open: and ſo the Lord ſaith, Violence is come to the Heauen, and it is violently reaft vp, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.12. As hee would ſay, Whereas few entered into the Heauen before, nowe they ruſh in, ſince the Lord Ieſus is come, and the yates ſhall ſtand vp aye and till the multitude of ſoules and bodies ſhall enter in. Seeing wee haue this grace, therefore, miſerable is the man who would not enter in, when the yates are open, and patent to let him in: and well is that ſoule, that will enter there. But yee will ſay, Why is there not entry into Heauen, but by the vertue of Ieſus Chriſt? I thinke ye would know the reaſon of this: There is none that can enter into Heauen, but with an offering of blood: Heauen is won by blood: It is vnpoſſible for a ſinner to enter into Heauen, but by a Sacrifice. So there is no remiſsion of ſinne, but by ſhedding of blood, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.22. The hight Prieſt of olde, who was a Type of Chriſt, durſt not enter into the earthly Sanctuary, which was a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of Heauen, where the glorious Arke was, but with a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:16631:8"/>
with an offering and blood; otherwiſe he would haue bene ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to death. This meaned, there is none entry to the Heauen, to that Sanctuary which is not made with mens handes, but by the Sonne of God himſelfe, and by his blood and ſacrifice. And why? Becauſe the wrath of God is againſt ſinners; &amp; that wrath cannot bee ſatisfied, but by blood: his mercy cannot prejudge his juſtice. This ground being laid, The Lord Ieſus entereth into Heauen by blood: hee entereth not there without a Sacrifice: hee taketh the moſt precious ſacrifice that euer was in the world: hee entered not with the blood of beaſts, but with his own precious blood: he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried there his owne bloody wounds: and that blood ſlokned that burning wrath: So that ſo ſoone as that juſtice findeth that blood, the juſtice is ſatisfied, &amp; then there is place to mercy. So it followeth, there is no entry to Heauen, but by the Lord Ieſus, &amp; his blood: and as he entered into Heauen by his own blood, ſo there is neuer one of vs, man or woman, ſhall enter into Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, except we carry with vs that blood: if thou wilt go into Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, be ſprinkled with that blood, or elſe the wrath of God ſhall burne thee vp. But how ſhalt thou get this? By faith in him, that hath gone before thee with his blood, that ſhall prepare for thee a rowm, &amp; thou ſhalt follow thy Head. So yee ſee, how needfull it is to belieue in Chriſt, if we would get entry into Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: it was not for his own cauſe he entred into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, but for vs: he paſſed with his blood before vs, to get vs an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Before he lay down the argument, he layes downe the ground ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f, <hi>In my Fathers houſe are many dwelling places, &amp; I go to prepare them.</hi> Brethren, Heauen is a very faire place, &amp; there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re many dwelling places into it, there is great honour into it. What is Heauen, but the glory of God? Whereto go we to Heauen, but that we may be partakers of that glory? who now without Chriſt are depriued of the glory of God. Who is able to meaſure his glory? for he is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit, he dwelleth into a light, wherto there is no acceſſe: And as the glory of God is infinit, ſo there are infinit dwelling places in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: Before the Aſcention of Chriſt, there were rowms enough, but they were al vnprepared, &amp; cloſed vp til he entred. By vertue of his Aſcenſion, al the yates were dong vp. Then what good doth th' Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion of Chriſt? It opens all the doors of Heauen to vs: there are dwelling places in Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for a thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d worlds, for infinit worlds, mo worlds than tong can tell: There is no ſcarcity in Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but as the glory of God is there, &amp; is infinit, &amp; can neuer be contained, ſo
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:16631:8"/>
there are infinit places: I ſay more, the Aſcenſion of Ieſus Chriſt vp to Heauen, is of ſuch force, that it is able to prepare a place for a thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d worlds, &amp; for euery reprobat. What is then the cauſe, that euery one goes not to Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſeeing the Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are able to contain ſo many? <hi>There are many called</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>but few elect.</hi> What is the cauſe of this? What is it, but this, No want of Manſions, there is no want in Ieſus Chriſt: but the cauſe is in men &amp; women, who want faith in Ieſus Chriſt. Who euer hath faith, they goe in: and who wants it, albeit there be many Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſions there, yet there is none for them: Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou heareſt there are ſo many dwelling places in Heauen, ſay with thy ſelfe, Lord, prepare mee for grace, as grace is prepared for me: &amp;, Lord, giue me faith into this blood, that I, by vertue therof, may haue a place in Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Striue therfore rather to throng in, &amp; to haue a part of that life, than to haue all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of the world: for if thou haſt not this, all the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities of the world ſhall go away, &amp; thou ſhalt be ſhot in Hell: No, ſtriue rather to get a part of that inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; it were the leaſt Manſion, than the whole earth: for there is more joye there, than in all the world. Hee ſaieth, <hi>And it were otherwiſe, J would haue tolde you.</hi> As hee would ſay, I am not boune to beguile you, and feed you with faire wordes: and there were not many dwelling places in my Fathers houſe, I would haue told you: the promiſe of the Lord Ieſus, is not like the promiſe of the world: for men will promiſe mountaines of gold: All men, of all eſtates, yea Princes, are liars: but the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus will promiſe nothing, but that which he will performe.

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving heard already (welbeloued Brethren) two arguments, whereby the Lord comforteth his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, who were heauily caſten downe for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting, and taking away of his bodily preſence from them: The firſt is, Faith in Chriſt: Howbeit when I goe away, ye ſhall not ſee me, yet ſettle your hearts vpon me, follow mee with the eyes of your ſoule, reſt vpon me with a true faith, &amp; then in the midſt of all troubles, ye ſhal get comfort &amp; eaſe to your ſoule. The ſecond argument is taken from their owne weale: My departure is to prepare a place for you in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:16631:9"/>
Heauen: if I goe not before you, yee can get no place there: (for neuer man either got, getteth, or ſhall get place there, but onely by the vertue of the Aſcenſion of Chriſt) It was not for his owne cauſe he entered into Heauen, but for vs: he paſſed with blood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs, to get vs an entry by his blood: He by his Aſcenſion opened vp to vs all the yates of Heauen, that we might goe in there. His Aſcenſion to Heauen, is of ſuch force, that it is able to prepare a dwelling place, and it were for a thouſand worldes, if men could haue faith in him. Now I come to the third argument, wherby he comfortes them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is taken from the ſecond co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to Chriſt to glorify them fully: And this of all other argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts brings grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt comfort to the ſoule. The former arguments are indeede very comfortable: faith worketh a great joy in the heart of a ſinner: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe faith makes Ieſus to bee preſent to the ſoule, euen then when it is abſent from the Lord, and walking yet in this pilgrimage here on the earth: Againe, it is a greater comfort to the ſoule, when we heare that Chriſt hath prepared a place for vs in Heauen, wherein faith ſhall be changed in ſight, &amp; we ſhall ſee him face to face<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and glorifie him without any ſtay or intermiſsion: yet none of theſe wil furniſh vs perfect ioy, if there be no more: for the conſcience of our owne weakneſſe, and the ſight and feeling of ſinne within vs, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs oftentimes to doubt, brangleth our faith, and ſtayeth our full conſolation. And albeit we heare, that Chriſt hath prepared a place for vs, and opened the Heauen to vs, yet our own weakneſſe and infirmity telleth vs, we cannot be able to come there, &amp; to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the poſſeſsion of the inheritance prepared for vs: But here is matter of perfect ioy, and full conſolation, when we heare that Chriſt will come again in his own perſon, &amp; take vs to the Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to the place hee hath prepared for vs: whereunto otherwiſe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of our weaknes, we could neuer come: <hi>Jf,</hi> ſaith Christ, <hi>I goe to prepare a place for you, I will come again, &amp; receiue you vnto my ſelf, that where J am, there may ye be alſo</hi>: As if he had ſaid, I depart not from you to remain abſent from you for euer. I purpoſe not ſo to do, but I will come again to you, to take you vp to the place that I haue prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that ye may remain with me in the Heauens, &amp; be partakers of my glory for euer. No queſtion, this was a great matter of comfort and ioy to the Diſciplis, when they heard, that Chriſt would come again to them, &amp; take them with himſelf to glory: &amp; doubtles this made them after Chriſts Aſcenſion, to haue their eys, hearts, &amp; affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions lift vp to Heauen, waiting for his bleſſed appearance.

Indeede it is true, our hope &amp; waiting for Chriſt, is ay co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>joyned with ſighing &amp; ſobbing, becauſe we haue not as yet gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ful fruitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. And therfore Paul ſaith, <hi>Wee who haue gotten the firſt fruits of the Spirit, euen we, ſigh in our ſelues, waiting for the adoption, euen the redemption of our bodie, Rom.</hi> 8.23. There ye ſee, with waiting he conjoyns ſighing: &amp; indeed the ſorow &amp; ſighing of the godly, is exceeding great, while as they are abſent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their Lord: But it is alſo true, that with this ſighing &amp; ſadnes, they find a ioy vnſpeakable &amp; glorious: yea, ſuch a ioy, as all the ioyes and outward comforts in the world cannot be able to furniſh vnto men. The naturall man, who ſeeks to haue ioy in outward thinges, neuer wiſt what true ioye meaned: thou that ſeeks ioy in thy riches, thou neuer knew true ioy: thou who ſeekes ioy in honour or preſerment, thou finds but a ſhadow of ioy: thou who ſeeks ioy in the pleaſurs of the fleſh, thou finds nothing in the end, but diſpleaſure, in ſtead of ioye: But the godly, in waiting for the comming of their Sauiour, find ſuch a ioy, that the heart of no naturall man is able to conceiue: and if thou found but one ſparke of this ioy into thy heart, thou would count nothing of all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ie ioyes, in reſpect of it: yea, thou would bee content to renounce all worldly pleaſures, that thou might bruik it. Now, Brethren, if our ioy be ſo great, euen now while we are abſent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lord, and are only waiting for his bleſſed appearance, O how great ſhall our ioy be, when our faith ſhall be turned in ſight, &amp; when we ſhall ſee him face to face, and when hee ſhall put vs in the full poſſeſsion of that inheritance, which now wee are hoping and longing for! But leauing this, I goe forwarde to the fourth argument of their conſolation, which hee taketh from the knowledge they had both of the place where he was going to, &amp; likewiſe of the way which led them to that place: <hi>For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>whither I goe, ye know, and the way ye know.</hi> As if he had ſaid, In the mean time, while I am come again to you, let this comfort you, that both ye know the place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto now I am going firſt, and wherevnto next ye ſhall follow me: and alſo, that ye know the way wherein ye ſhal walke, that ye may
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:16631:10"/>
come to that place: yee knowe both the one, and the other: And if there were none other thing, but this knowledge, it may ſerue to comfort you, the time of mine abſence from you, while I come againe, and take you to that place with my ſelfe. Marke the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Brethren, It is a great comfort, to a man who is abſent from the Lorde, and woulde faine bee preſent with him, to knowe the place where the Lord is, and likewiſe to knowe the way howe hee may come to that place where hee may find the Lord, and enioye his bleſſed preſence: Ye know this by experience, that if a Pilgrime bee wandering in his iourney, and in the meane time knowe no place, where at length hee maye come to reſt in, it will bee a ſore griefe to him: and againe, yee knowe, howbeit hee knewe a place where to find reſt, and yet knew not the way how to come to that place, he will be very baſed, and exceedingly caſten downe. But by the contrary, if the Pilgrime in his iourneying, knowe both the place wherin to reſt, and likewiſe the way how to come to it, he is greatly reioyced, becauſe hee hath a ſure hope to come to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting place: Euen ſo fareth it with vs, who are Gods Children: while in this Pilgrimage we are wandering, abſent from the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if wee neither knowe the place where the Lord is, and where wee may find reſt for our ſoules with him, neither know the way, how to come to it, wee cannot but bee wonderfully diſcouraged: but i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> on the other part, wee know both the place of our reſting, (that permanent City that hath a foundation) and alſo the way how to come to it, it cannot bee poſsible, but our ſoules muſt reſt in hope to come there. So yee ſee, the knowledge of the place whither wee ſhould goe to ſeeke the Lord, and of the way that leadeth to that place, furniſheth great comfort and ioye to the ſoule: Whereas by the contrary, the ignorance and mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>kenning of the place and way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is euer accompanied with great dolour and ſadneſſe.</p>
            <p>Nowe to goe forwarde: The Diſciples, when they heare theſe words that Chriſt vttereth, of the way and the place, they miſtake him, and vnderſtand him not: and therefore Thomas, one of their number, opponeth himſelfe to the Lords words: and whereas the Lorde had ſaide vnto them, they knewe both the place whither hee vvas going, and the vvaye, Thomas opponeth himſelfe to both: affirming, That they neyther knewe the place, nor the vvaye: For, ſayeth Thomas, <hi>Wee knowe not whither thou goe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> howe can wee then knowe the Waye</hi>? As if Thomas had ſaid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>

               </gap>s
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:16631:11"/>
and we know alſo the way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but we know not whither thou goeſt, and therfore we cannot know the way: both the place and the way are vnknowne vnto vs. Theſe wordes at the firſt face would ſeeme to haue a direct contradiction to the Lordes wordes: but if wee weigh and conſider the matter deeply, as it becommeth, wee will finde that in effect there is no contradiction, but both may ſtand very well together: for the Lord ſpake of a begun and a generall knowledge, which the Lord communicateth to euery one that is a true member of his body: And this knowledge, how ſmal ſoeuer it be, the Lord accepteth of it: for it was propheſied of him, that he ſhould not break the bruiſed reed, nor quench the ſmoking flax, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay.</hi> 42.3. But rather where he finds any knowledge begun, he che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth it, &amp; maketh the ſoule to grow from knowledge to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, till it come to perfection. But Thomas miſtaketh the Lord, for hee thinketh that the Lord ſpeaketh of a diſtinct and perfect knowledge and this maketh Thomas to oppone againſt the Lord, and to affirme, that they neither knew whither hee went, nor yet the way. And theſe two ſpeakinges may very well ſtand together, that they had a begun and confuſed knowledge both of the place whither the Lord went, and of the way to that place: of the which knowledge the Lord ſpake: and neuertheleſſe, that they knew not diſtinctly &amp; perfectly, neither the place nor the way, of the which knowledge Thomas meaneth. The like of this is to be vnderſtood when wee ſpeake of the knowledge the Prophets had of the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Gentiles: for with good reaſon wee may ſay, that the Prophets knewe the calling of the Gentiles, becauſe they had it fore-told them in their propheſies. Yet Paul ſaith, that the calling of the Gentiles was a myſtery which in other ages was not ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vp vnto the ſonnes of men. Theſe two ſayings ſtand very well together: neither is there any contradiction in them: for the one is to be vnderstood of a begun and imperfect knowledge: the other of a diſtinct and perfect knowledge. Againe, wee may ſay, Chriſt ſpake of the knowledge which the Diſciples ſhould haue had, and might haue had, if they had taken good enough heed to Chriſtes doctrine and inſtructions: for howe oft had the Lord preached to them, of the kingdome of Heauen, which was the place, whither hee was firſt to goe, and they next to follow him? Howe oft ſpake hee vnto them, of the Father, who ſent him for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the Worlde? Howe often ſpake hee vnto them, of the right way that ledde to Heauen? Yea, hee pointed it out with
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:16631:11"/>
his finger; as when he ſaid, I am the light of the world, IOH. 8. &amp;c. Therefore, ſeeing the Lord ſpake of theſe things ſo many times, and ſo clearly, and was ſo carefull to inſtruct them, the Diſciples might well enough haue knowne both the place and the way: and their negligence cannot bee excuſed, who were ſo rude and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and profited ſo little in theſe things. And ſo Thomas by this his anſwering to the Lord, letteth vs ſee how little knowledge he had attained vnto; notwithſtanding of all the trauell the Lord had taken to inſtruct them: Alwayes out of theſe wordes of Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, wee may take vp a profitable Leſſon, concerning the order of our knowledge of heauenly things: Thomas ſaith firſt, Wee know not the place where thou goeſt: and vpon this hee gathereth, Wee cannot knowe the waye: Then the Leſſon is, Wee muſt firſt haue a knowledge of the place where we ſhould goe to, before wee can haue a knowledge of the way that leadeth vnto the place: Wee muſt firſt haue a knowledge of Heauen, and that there is life, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and happineſſe laide vp for the Sainctes there: Wee muſt know what manner of glory wee haue to looke for; and then it is time for vs to inquire what way wee may come to Heauen: what way we may attaine to that glory and happineſſe: For there is no man that will take on a journey, till he know where he would be, and what ſhould be the end of his labour: He that runneth, hee will ſet vp a marke before him, that he would be at: Paul ſaith of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.26. I ſo runne, not as vncertainly: ſo fight I, not as one that beareth the aire: that is, I runne not, nor I fight not, for nought: but I runne, to get the crowne: I fight, that I may get the victory: Hee ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ne with all his might towardes the marke, for the prize of the high calling of God in Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.14. So, we muſt firſt haue the prize and the marke of the high calling ſet before our eyes; and thereafter we muſt enter into the way that leadeth to that marke. There are none of the Sainctes, but they haue euer Heauen ſet before their eyes: they deſire, they ſigh and ſobbe to bee there, becauſe they know, that there, in the preſence of the Lord, there is fulneſſe of ioye; and that at his right hand, there are pleaſures for euermore, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.11. And therefore Paul ſaith of them, that they haue their conuerſation in Heauen, from whence they looke for their Sauiour, euen the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who ſhall change their vile bodies, that they may be faſhioned like vnto his glorious body, &amp;c. <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.20. And in the viii. Chapter to the <hi>Rom. verſ.</hi> 23. hee ſaith, that they who haue gotten the firſt
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:16631:12"/>
fruits of the Spirit, they ſigh in themſelues, waiting for the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, euen the redemption of their bodies: And (<hi>Tit.</hi> 2.13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) he ſaith, <hi>We looke for that bleſſed hope, and appearing of that glory of that mighty God, our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt</hi>: And therefore, ſeeing their eyes are alwayes ſet vpon Heauen, and vpon that glory that is there, the Scripture eſpecially inſiſteth in the way, wherby we may come there: &amp; our Preaching, for the moſt part, is all of that way: to wit, of Ieſus Chriſt, and of that grace that we haue of him: And ſo the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, hee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e in his anſwere that he maketh to Thomas, ſpeaketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the place, neither of the Father, to whom he was to goe: but preſupponing that they had ſome knowledge thereof, he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth by them for the preſent, albeit heereafter hee will ſpeake of them. And in his anſwere to Thomas, hee inſiſteth vpon the way, and he ſaith, <hi>J am that Way</hi>: And then he telleth more plainly, how he is the Way, when hee ſaith in the words following, that hee is <hi>that Trueth, and that Life</hi>: So that if wee would come to the Father, we muſt come by him: for, <hi>No man,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>commeth vnto the Father, but by me.</hi> And therefore, wee ſhall ſee firſt how Chriſt is called the Trueth, and the Life, that wee may ſee the better howe hee is the Way. He is called the Trueth in ſundry reſpects: as firſt, he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Trueth, becauſe he is true: as Iohn ſpeaketh of him in his firſt Epiſtle, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. We know that that Son of God is come, and hath giuen vnto vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a minde to know him, which is true: and wee are in him that is true: that is, in that his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt. Next, hee is called the Trueth, becauſe hee is full of trueth: yea, of his owne eſſence and nature, he is Trueth it ſelfe. Iohn ſaid before of him, Wee ſaw him full of grace and trueth, <hi>Iohn,</hi> 1.14. And Paul ſaieth, that the fulneſſe of the Godhead dwelleth in him bodily, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.9. Thirdly, hee is called Trueth, becauſe from him, as the Author and Fountaine, all trueth doeth flowe and proceede: And therefore Iohn ſaide, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. The law is giuen by Moſes, but grace and trueth, by Ieſus Chriſt. Fourthly, hee is called the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ueth, becauſe hee is the matter and ſubject of all trueth, and all trueth is grounded vpon him: And in this reſpect Iohn ſaieth, Euery ſpirite which confeſſeth, that Ieſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh, is of God: and euery ſpirite that confeſſeth not, that Ieſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh, is not of God, but is the ſpirite of the Antichriſt, <hi>Iohn,</hi> 4.2. And Paul ſaith, Another foundation can no man lay, than that which is laid, which is Ieſus Chriſt. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. Fiftly, hee is called the Trueth, becauſe all trueth is in him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:16631:12"/>
is, ratified, confirmed, and eſtablished in him: for as the Apoſtle Paul ſaieth, in his ſeconde Epiſtle to the Corinthians, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. All the promiſes of God are Yea and Amen in him: that is, all haue their foundation, and ground, and all haue their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment in him: For and if thou bee not in Chriſt, thou canſt haue no right to any of the promiſes of Grace: Thou ſhalt neuer find the power and vertue of them to bee communicated to thy ſoule: No, the blood of Ieſus muſt bee firſt ſhed, and next thy conſcience muſt bee ſprinkled therewith, before that euer thou find the force and power of any of theſe promiſes conuoyed to thy ſoule: So all are grounded vpon his blood. Then ye ſee, it is not without good cauſe, that Chriſt claimeth this Style as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to himſelfe, That he is the Trueth: becauſe he is true, becauſe he is full of trueth, becauſe from him is all trueth becauſe of him, as the proper ſubject, is all trueth: and laſt, becauſe in him all the promiſes of God haue their trueth and accompliſhment.</p>
            <p>Now let vs ſee how hee is called Life: and this Style the Lord taketh to himſelfe for ſundry reſpects: And firſt, becauſe he liueth, and liueth eternally: yea, he is Life it ſelfe. Secondly, becauſe hee liueth by himſelfe: he liueth not by another, as creatures doe: for he ſaith of himſelfe, As the Father hath life in himſelfe, ſo hath hee likewiſe giuen to the Sonne, to haue life in himſelfe, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 5.26. Thirdly, becauſe through him, and by him, all thinges that haue life, liue: Yea, this ſame naturall life, that wee liue heere on the earth, wee liue it by him: For Iohn, ſpeaking of him, ſaieth, (<hi>Iohn, Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 4.) In it (that is, the Worde IESVS CHRIST,) was Life: and that Life was the light of men: That is, hee gaue life to men, euen in the very firſt creation: and not onely liue wee this naturall life by him; but alſo, by him wee liue a ſupernaturall life: I am crucified with Chriſt, (ſayeth the Apoſtle Paule to the Galatians, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>verſ.</hi> 20.) but I liue: yet not I anie more: but Chriſt liueth in mee: and that that I nowe liue in the fleſh, I liue by Fayth in the Sonne of God, who hath loued mee, and giuen himſelfe for mee. There yee ſee clearely, that the Apoſtle Paule affirmeth, that the Spirituall Life, is onely the benefite of CHRIST. And Iohn teſtifieth the ſame, in the firſt Chapter of his Euangel, and the fift verſe where hee ſayeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That Light ſhineth in darkneſſe: That is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

ouer-gone the ſoule of man, ſo that there was nothing to be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for of man, but vtter darkneſſe, and eternall death; then he il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated the ſoule of man with ſpirituall light, that hee might be reſtored againe to eternall life: Therefore, ſeeing Chriſt liueth, ſeeing hee liueth by himſelfe, ſeeing all thinges liue by him, good reaſon hath hee to call himſelfe that life. Now hitherto wee haue let you ſee in what reſpectes Chriſt is called the Trueth and the Life; whereby wee may eaſily perceiue howe Chriſt is called the Way: Chriſt is called the way to the Father in two reſpects: Firſt, he is the Way, as hee is the Trueth: Next, hee is the Way, as hee is the Life: for we muſt firſt goe to the Father by Chriſt, as he is the Trueth: and thereafter we muſt goe to the Father by him, as he is the Life: for this way to the Father hath two parts: The firſt part is Trueth: the ſecond Life: and therefore if we would come to the Father, we muſt begin at the Trueth: wee muſt enter into the way to him by Trueth. Now, howe enter wee into this way to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by the Trueth? Howe is the Trueth, the beginning of the way? I will tell you: Whileſt we addreſſe our ſelues to God, to the Father, wee muſt firſt of all perſwade ourſelues and haue full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that Chriſt is the Trueth: that all his wordes are true: that all the promiſes of God are true, and are accompliſhed in him. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we haue entered into this way to the Father, by Chriſt, as he is the Trueth, wee muſt next enter into the way to the Father, by Chriſt, as he is Life: But how enter we into this way, by him, as he is Life? How bringeth Chriſt vs to the Father, as he is Life? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, Whileſt we are going to the Father, wee muſt ſtedfaſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue, and bee fully aſſured, that Chriſt is Life, and that all life is from him, as from the Fountaine; and that whatſoeuer life wee haue, we haue it through him. Then ye ſee, Chriſt is the way to the Father: firſt, becauſe he is the Trueth: next, becauſe he is the Life. If thou wouldeſt come to Life, begin at the Trueth; for the firſt leadeth vs to the ſecond: For this word of Trueth, euen the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of the Lord Ieſus, when it is preached, if we heare it reuerent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and ſtedfaſtly belieue it, and let it ſettle deeply in our ſoules, it will bee powerfull at the laſt, to bring foorth life in vs: Were thy ſoule neuer ſo dead in ſinnes and treſpaſſes, yet receiuing this Word of Trueth, thou ſhalt riſe from death, and liue. The Lord (in the ſixt Chapter of Iohn, and the 63. verſe) letteth vs ſee this great force of this Word, when he ſaith, The words that I ſpeake to you, are Spirit and Life: that is, they are a moſt powerfull
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:16631:13"/>
meane, to miniſter and furniſh vnto vs, that Spirite, and that Life of God. And in that ſame Chapter alſo, vvhen the Lord asketh at the Apoſtles, If they would leaue him? as many of them did, who had followed him before, Peter anſwereth, in the name of the reſt, To whom ſhall we goe? thou haſt the words of eternall life: where ye ſee, Peter out of his own experience, affirmeth, that the vvords vvhich hee heard of Chriſt, vvere effectuall to vvorke eternall life: vvhich made him, and the reſt of the Apoſtles, vvith pleaſure to remaine vvith Chriſt. Thou that by the hearing of the vvord, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt the life of God to bee conuoyed to thy ſoule, vvilt eaſily bee perſwaded, that hee vvho is the Author of that vvord, is life him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: for how vvere it poſsible, that there could be ſuch a power in that vvorde, to giue life, except hee, vvhoſe vvorde it is, vvere the Fountaine and Well-ſpring of all life? Then ye ſee, by vvhat order vve come to the Father: Wee muſt firſt begin at the Trueth, then, by the vvord of Trueth, vve muſt be led to Life: and then, we muſt goe on, piece and piece, in that Life: vvee muſt continue and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in it: and ſo doing, it is not poſſible, but at laſt vvee ſhall come into that eternall Life, vvhich is hid vp in God, and ſhall bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed in that great day. Then, in a vvord, vvouldeſt thou haue the ſumme of all that vve haue ſpoken in this matter? This is it, Euen that vvee belieue in the Lord Ieſus Chriſt: The vvay to the Father, is Chriſt: vvhen vvee belieue in him, vvee are vvalking in this vvay: vvhen our fayth increaſeth piece and piece, vvee goe on forward, vve continue, and perſeuer in that vvay.</p>
            <p>Now in the ende of the verſe, he preuenteth, and anſwereth the thing, that ſome might haue objected againſt this doctrine, That he was the way: for it might haue bene ſaid to Chriſt, Albeit thou bee the way to the Father, yet thou art not the only way; there are many other wayes beſide thee. To this the Lord anſwereth, I am the onelie waye to come to the Father: for (ſayeth hee) <hi>None com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to the Father, but by mee</hi>: That is, I am ſo the waye, to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that there is none other waye to come to the Father beſide me: And whoſoeuer ſeeketh to come to the Father by another way beſide me: or whoſoeuer ſeeketh to come to the Father any other way, but by me, he ſhall be diſappointed, he ſhall neuer find the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: thou that ſeeks to come to Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another way, nor by Chriſt, I giue thee that doome, thou ſhalt neuer ſee Heauen, Men dreame to themſelues another way to come to Heauen, nor by Chriſt: the Papiſts deceiue themſelues, and the whole worlde; teaching
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:16631:14"/>
them to ſeeke Heauen, by their owne merits, by their own works, and to come to the Father by the mediation &amp; interceſsion of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, of the Saincts departed, &amp;c. But all this is folly, for there is one only way to Heauen, and that a very ſtrait and narrow way, by Ieſus Chriſt: Indeed the way to Hell is a very broade way: that is, there are many wayes that leade to damnation: for there is not a ſinne that thou committeſt againſt God, but it leadeth thee to Hell: Whoredome leadeth a man to Hell, Murder leadeth a man to Hell, Drunkenneſſe leadeth a man to Hell; all the foule affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of thine heart, leade thee to Hell: But there is one only way to come to Heauen, Fayth in Ieſus Chriſt. Therefore, thou who wouldeſt come to Heauen, and dwell with the Father for euer, leaue all other wayes, for they are but pathes, that leade to dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: and take thee to that only one way: belieue in the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and through him thou ſhalt bee aſſured to get life and glory. To this Lord Ieſus, with the Father, and the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, be all prayſe, and honour, for euer. Amen.</p>

that is laide on euery ſoule that commeth into this world, if euer they would haue joy in this worlde, and if euer they would dwell in Heauen, that the creature knowe the glorious Creator.

            <p>Now, Brethren, it is an hard thing to get a ſight of that Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie: The Lord dwelleth in a light that hath none acceſſe. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16. Neuer man ſaw him, Paul ſayth. He is a God that cannot bee ſeene; the eye of the creature, cannot be able to look vpon that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing glory. So it is an hard thing to ſee God, &amp; to know him: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let neither man nor woman, who preaſſeth to get a ſight of God, ſtriue to pierce immediately thorowe that light. Then, howe ſhall wee ſee him? The Lord perceiuing our infirmity, hath prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a way: wee founde it not out, but the Lord hath found it out. What is the waye to ſee the Lorde, in his infinite juſtice, power, wiſedome, glory, and chiefely, in his mercy? And thou ſee him not in his mercy, all is but in vaine; and thou ſeeſt nothing, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit thou ſhouldeſt ſee all the worlde.) The Lord hath found out the meane: The Lord Ieſus, his owne Sonne, his owne Image, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenteth vnto vs all the glorie of his Father: and hee is the Image of the inuiſible God, the ſplendor of his glorie, and the imprinted marke of his perſon. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. The Lord hath ordained<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that in the Son, euen in the nature of man, &amp; hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in the fleſh, wee ſhould ſee that glory. And this is the ende, wherfore the Lord Ieſus came into the world: euen that we might ſee the glory of the Father in him. This is ſo true, that hee who ſeeth the Sonne, ſeeth alſo the Father: that when in the Goſpel thou heareſt and ſeeſt Ieſus Chriſt, humbled and glorified, except in him thou ſee the Father, his nature, his juſtice, his power, his wiſedome, and his mercie, thou canſt not bee ſaide to haue a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient knowledge of the Sonne himſelfe: for hee himſelfe ſayeth heere, If ye had knowne me, yee ſhould haue knowne my Father alſo. Then he ſaith by way of correction, <hi>No,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Thomas, thou knoweſt the Father,</hi> and ſo I ſpeake of the reſt <hi>and</hi> thou <hi>haſt ſeene him</hi>: ſay what thou wilt ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is the meaning. Vpon this ſpeach two things ariſe: The firſt, the Apoſtles &amp; diſciples of Ieſus Chriſt, they knew the Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, they wiſt not that they knew him.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:16631:15"/>
How can theſe two ſtand? They knew him, and ſaw him: for Iohn ſaith, We ſaw him vvith our eyes: but they vviſt it not. What is the grounde of this ignorance, that ſeeing the Sonne, they knewe the Father, and yet they wiſt it not? It riſeth on this, they were ignorant, that the Father and the Sonne, were one in ſubſtance, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, glory and Majeſty: And howbeit they ſawe the Father, and and the glory of God in the Sonne, yet being ignorant of this ground, they wiſt not, that they knew the Father.</p>
            <p>Nowe, Brethren, as concerning this, ſeeing there is no ſolide comfort nor reſt in the heart, but in the ſight of God, keepe this ſight night and day, and ſleepe on it, for it vvill bee a blacke vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening, and vve reſt not on him: Wee may vvell reſt on theſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, on theſe Kingdomes, &amp;c. but yet miſerable ſhall be thy vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening: vvhen the ſoule ſhall bee taken from the body, it ſhall tell thee, that there is no reſt, but in him: and thou ſhalt curſe the time that euer thou reſtedſt on any thing in the world. There is no joy, but in the ſight of God. Next, except a man or woman knowe God to bee God, vvhen they ſee his power and verity to appeare in the world, &amp; aboue all things, his mercy to ſinners: except they take vp God in theſe thinges, and chiefely in his mercy: except they knowe him to be God, they vvill neuer haue ſolide comfort. (A man vvho hath bene out of his Fathers ſight long, vvhen hee ſeeth him, and knoweth him not, he vvill haue no comfort.) But then vvhen vvee ſee him, and knowe him to bee our mercifull Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there is our joye. When the ſinner ſeeth God in Ieſus Chriſt, and knoweth him to bee his Father, there is the chiefe joye. But how ſhall we come to the knowledge of this? We muſt know firſt of all, that the Sonne is the ſplendor of his Father: (thou vvilt get no acceſſe to the Father, but by the Sonne:) and therefore, ſeeing the glory of the Father ſhineth in the Sonne, vvhen thou commeſt to heare the Lord Ieſus preached, ſay thus, In the Lorde Ieſus, vvhoſe Euangel I am to heare, I ſhal ſee the glory of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And vvhen euer ye heare the Euangel, ſtriue to get that ſight of the Father, through the Sonne: and then thine heart ſhall get exceeding joy into it. This muſt euery one of vs doe, if vve vvould goe to Heauen.</p>
            <p>When Thomas hath ſpoken, and the Lord hath anſwered him, another of the Diſciples ſpake: for they vvere ignorant, till the Lordes reſurrection. Philip ſpeaketh next, <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>once ſhew vſ the Father</hi>: As he vvould ſay, Once let vs ſee him, and vve ſhall be
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:16631:16"/>
contented. Marke, in this queſtion there is one thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, and another thing diſcommendable: not that there is any good in vs: there is aye a piece of imperfection in the beſt of vs all. Then, that which in Philip is to be commended, is this: that hee hath a deſire to ſee God: one of the greateſt graces that euer was: for Chriſt ſayeth, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 5.6.) Bleſſed are they that hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirſt for righteouſneſſe. Woe to that ſoule, that neither hath ſeene the Father, neither yet hath any deſire to ſee him. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other thing is commendable: Hee thought, if once he could get a ſight of God, hee woulde bee contented. Indeede, the onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment that man or woman hath in this world, is into the ſight of God: All the thinges in the worlde, will not giue a conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to the ſoule: but the more thou haſt of an earthly thing, as Riches, Honour, and pleaſure, the more euer ſhalt thou craue: But and once thou ſeeſt the face of God, in the which there is ſatietie of all joye, there ſhalt thou finde full reſt to thy ſoule, and thou ſhalt haue ſuch a joye and contentation, that thou ſhalt craue no more: for all fulneſſe is in his face, and hee filleth the creature with the beames of his glory. And this Philip ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth: Wee ſhall then bee contented, getting a ſight of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Majeſtie.</p>
            <p>There are other thinges diſcommendable: Hee vttereth a great ignorance, euen of this grounde, That the Sonne is the Image of the Father: The Sonne and the Father are but one in nature, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and Majeſtie. He misknew this ground, without the which there is no comfort. There is another thing diſcommendable in him: Chriſt was inſtructing them in this grounde, and hee vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a dulneſſe in the meane time, as if Chriſt had not ſpoken one worde: Theſe are two faultes: Ignorance is a fault, and the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of God chiefly: And their dulneſſe and ſtupidity of heart is another fault, whereby men and women are ſo ſenſeleſſe and blockiſh, that they are neyther moued with the thing that they heare, nor able to conceiue the ſame: as for the firſt, and thou ſhouldeſt knowe all the worlde, and misknowe God, thou haſt no knowledge. Paul, (<hi>Philipp.</hi> 3.) profeſſeth, he would misknow all the thinges in the worlde, for the knowledge of that eminence of Chriſt: Hee was a great Scholler, and a wiſe man: yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of that knowledge of Chriſt, hee counted all but dammage: yea, hee counted all but dirt: but hee calleth it, Eminence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſurmounteth all the knowledge in the worlde: it
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:16631:16"/>
reacheth farther than Heauen: yea, aboue the thirde Heauen. So ignorance is an euill thing: and ignorance of God, is the worſt thing in the world: It is not ſo great a miſerie, to bee in a darke pitte, as to bee wrapped in ſuch darkneſſe, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee the Lorde Ieſus. If an ignorant creature, who knoweth nothing of the Creator, haue a deſire, and an hunger, and thirſt, to bee fred out of that pit of ignorance, there is grace: and it muſt followe of neceſsitie, that that creature, who faine woulde knowe the Lorde Ieſus, muſt get knowledge: the Lorde ſhall drawe him out of that darkneſſe, which is the beginning of Hell. Chriſt ſayeth, They who hunger and thirſt for righteouſneſſe, ſhall bee filled. Bleſſed are they who hunger for God, for of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsitie that creature muſt bee filled: And on the other parte, a man, or a woman, who knoweth not God, and then in the meane time hath no deſire to knowe God: (as, alace, ouer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie there bee, who deſire not to knowe God, as if there were no Heauen nor Hell after this life:) It is a ſure token, they will bee caſten into vtter darkneſſe, a worlde of all miſerie.</p>
            <p>If there be anie of you who is ignorant, and hath no deſire to be fredde thereof, I ſay to you, and yee continue ſo, and die ſo, your ſoule ſhall goe to that darkneſſe of Hell. If anie bodie bee in darkeneſſe, and taketh a delectation therein, and if hee were a King, Emperour, or Monarch: howbeeit hee had all the knowledge in the worlde, hee is but a miſerable catiue: For what is all the wiſedome of this worlde, without the knowledge of IESVS CHRIST? But meere fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie: And the LORD ſhall make that wiſedome, which the Great men of this Lande count much of, to be a ſnare to trappe them into: All the thinges that they haue, and the fauour of men, ſhall not ſaue them from judgement, becauſe of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of IESVS CHRIST.</p>
            <p>So yee ſee in Philip what was commendable, and what was diſcommendable: If wee bee in ignorance, let vs deſire to bee fredde from it: And if wee bee dull and ſenſeleſſe, let vs bee carefull to vnderſtande the worde of the LORD: Let vs laye it vp in our heart, and meditate on it day and night, with prayer to GOD, to giue vs vnderſtanding heartes: for to him that knocketh, it ſhall bee opened.</p>
            <p>Nowe the LORDE anſwereth to Philip: Indeede, conſidering howe hee had inſtructed them from the beginning,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:16631:17"/>
He might haue reproued him, and ſaid, I haue inſtructed you, and as I perceiue, yee haue profited nothing. But the Lord yet tyreth not, nor caſteth them not off: but teacheth them vvith patience, and vvith lenity, becauſe he knew vvhat vvas in man. There is not a Teacher, vvho is vnperfect in himſelfe, vvho vvill teach vvith ſuch lenity, as the Lord did, vvho had no ignorance in him, but the fulneſſe of all knowledge. He leaueth his example to bee fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, that all Teachers may teach vvith lenity after him. So Paul biddeth Timothie, being a young man, teach vvith lenity, 2. <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth.</hi> 4.2. It vvas not for nothing, he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> bore vvith them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that they ſhould beare vvith others afterward, when they ſhould teach others: for they vvho feele the hardneſſe and dulneſſe of nature beſt, they haue greateſt compaſſion vpon others. The doctrine he vſeth, is by vvay of rebuke: and it is but a gentle rebuke: for hee sayth, <hi>How ſayest thou, Shew vs the Father</hi>? As if hee vvould ſay, How is this, Philip, that thou ſayſt, Shew me the Father? He is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent vvith this, but hee rebuketh and teacheth Philip, in the grounds of the knowledge of God: and he ſayth, <hi>He who</hi> knoweth me, and <hi>ſeeth mee, hee ſeeth the Father</hi>: but ſo it is thou ſeeſt mee; it is a ſhame to thee, to misken me: therefore how askeſt thou at mee, Shew me the Father? Yet he ſayth, <hi>Belieueſt thou not, Philip, that the Father is in mee, and J in him?</hi> One in eſſence, glory, and Majeſty, howbeit diuerſe in perſons: Philip, belieueſt thou not, that I am the ſplendor of his glory? For hee is the expreſſe forme, of him vvho cannot bee ſeene. Therefore, vvouldeſt thou ſee the Father, to thy comfort, that thou mayeſt be tranſchanged to the like glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie? (Wee may ſee men, yea, Kings, in glory, and vve vvill get none of it: but vvhen we ſee that Maieſty, the beames that ſtrike on vs, ſhall tranſchange vs.) So, I ſaye, vvouldeſt thou ſee thy felicity, vvouldeſt thou ſee God? and as thou vvouldeſt deſire to liue, thou muſt deſire to ſee him: then preaſſe to get a ſight of the Son: looke that thou paſſe not by him. Wilt thou doe as the Iew does? The Iewes got not a ſight of him, becauſe they paſſed by the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias. So let all thy trauell be, to get the Lord Ieſus: But ye vvill ſay, The Diſciples might eaſily ſee him, becauſe hee vvas vvith them bodily and ſenſibly: but howe can I ſee him? I anſwere, There are two kindes of ſights; the one is the Spirituall ſight, of the eye of the ſoule, vvhich vve call Fayth, vvhen thou heareſt the glorious Euangel of Ieſus, and beliueſt into it: The other ſight is vvith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hy bodily eyes: and thou vvho ſeeſt him heere vvith the eye of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:16631:17"/>
the ſoule, by fayth, thou ſhalt ſee him hereafter, vvith thy bodily eyes. Then vvee muſt not be ſo groſſe, as to thinke, except vvee ſee the Lord Ieſus vvith the eyes of the body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that vvee get no ſight of him: for the ſight vve haue vvith the eye of fayth, is a precious ſight: and this ſight maketh his members here to loue him excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. <hi>Iohn,</hi> 20.29. hee ſayth, Thomas, becauſe thou haſt ſeene mee, thou belieueſt: but bleſſed ſhall they bee, vvho hath not ſeene mee, and yet belieueth. Belieue but a ſhort vvhile, and thou ſhalt ſee the faireſt ſight that euer creature ſaw: and in the meane time, thou ſhalt get <hi>joye</hi> in belieuing, vvhile thy fayth bee turned in ſight, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. he ſayth, Though vvee ſee him not, yet belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in him, vve rejoyce vvith a joy that is vnſpeakable and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. O then vvhat ſhall that joy be, when thou ſhalt ſee his face! But howe is it, that in Chriſt vvee ſee the Father? There is the ground: The Father and the Sonne are one in glory, in power, in wiſdome, juſtice, mercy, &amp;c. Marke vvell this grounde: When yee come to heare of Chriſt, bring it vvith you, and ſettle it into your heart: The Father and the Sonne are one, and the Sonne is the Image of his Father: And this grounde being ſettled into your ſoule, then the ſinner ſhall reſt in hope, and ſhall haue joy, and ſhall reach in to the Father: and then the creature findeth the ſelfe ſure and faſt: and it vvere in the fire, and thou vvere in the denne vvith the Lyons, and in the middeſt of death and extremity, thy ſoule ſhall get reſt: for vvhat ſhall ſeparate thee from the loue of God? Yea, as Paul ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. Thou ſhalt find thy ſelfe more than victorious. And vvithout this ſecurity in Chriſt Ieſus, I vvill not giue a pennie for all the ſecurity of men, and for all the remiſsion of the Prince: the Lord ſhal bruiſe thee down, for al thy remiſsion. Well, vvell, the Lord be mercifull to vs, and to our Prince, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>When hee hath laide downe this laſt ground, hee vſeth ſenſible arguments, to conuince them, That they behoued to ſay, That the Father vvas in him, and hee in the Father: that is, that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ordes he ſpake: The ſecond, from the vvorkes hee vvrought: So, vvould he ſay, vvould yee haue ſure argumentes, that the Father and I am one? take heed to my vvords, take heed to my works<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in them yee ſhall ſee, that I, vvho ſpeaketh, am the Sonne of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The vvordes that the Lord ſpake in the vvorlde, and the vvorkes hee vvrought, bare vvitneſſe to them that ſawe him, and hearde him, that hee vvas God: Hee ſpake vvith ſuch a grace, and vvith ſuch
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:16631:18"/>
authoritie, and ſuch a Majeſtie, that they who hearde, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at his doctrine: In a worde, hee was ſuch a Man, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was. Looke what the ſeruantes of the Phariſees ſaid, when they had no power to touch him: Neuer man ſpake as this man, <hi>Iohn,</hi> 7. <hi>verſ.</hi> 46. The Phariſees themſelues vnderſtanding the worke that hee wrought, in giuing ſight to the man that was borne blinde, were forced to ſaye, It cannot bee, but this man is of God, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. <hi>verſ.</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>But, Brethren, come to his Diſciples: The enemies were aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, but his Diſciples were not ſo: but they felt the ſweetneſſe that was in him: as Peter confeſſeth, Where ſhall wee goe to? thou haſt the wordes of eternall life, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6 <hi>verſ.</hi> 68. Hee ſaide, The wordes of Ieſus had power to life. So the two Diſciples, when they were going to Emmaus, after hee had left ſpeaking to them, and was gone away, they ſaide, Did not our heartes burne within vs, while hee talked with vs by the waye, and when hee opened to vs the Scriptures? <hi>Luke,</hi> 24.32. The worde of the Lord hath power to burne vp the droſſe of the heart. Wee alſo, by the preaching of the Goſpel, finde by experience, that life is conuoyed to our ſoule. What meaneth this? It meaneth, that the Lord, who ſpake, was life, and that the Godhead dwelt in him. Set mee vp a Philoſopher, vvill his vvordes giue life? No, the vvordes of man can giue thee no life: but the vvordes of the Author of Life, giueth life. It is true, vvee haue not the Lord himſelfe, outwardlie ſpeaking vnto vs: but all that is ſpoken of him nowe, it is ſpoken by infirme men, and ſinners, vveake ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie bodies: (and this is the cauſe vvhy the vvorlde contemneth the Goſpel:) It pleaſeth the Lord ſo to confound the vviſdome of the vvorlde. But it is alſo true, If they vvho preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, ſeeke the glorie of the Lorde Ieſus, and the ſaluation of man, they ſhall haue this vantage; The Lord will accompanie the worde ſpoken by them ſo powerfullie, by his Spirite, that it ſhall furniſh life to the hearers. Yee ſee this in experience, and all the Sainctes, vvho haue anie ſight of Ieſus Chriſt, vvitneſſe it: And it vvere but a ſillie baſe man, vvho is ſpeaking the vvorde, that ſame vvorde vvill haue power to life: And this is the meane the Lorde vſeth, vvhile his comming againe. And albeit the vvorde of the Croſſe of Ieſus, to ſpeake of an hanged man, dying a death vvhich vvas curſed by God himſelfe, of Ieſus nayled on the Croſſe, be the baſeſt thing, and the moſt foolish thing in the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:16631:18"/>
vvorlde; yet Paul ſayeth, The vvorde of the ſame Croſſe of IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS, is the power of GOD to Life, to them vvho belieue: It is the power of GOD, and the vvisedome of GOD: The greateſt wiſedome and power that anie faythfull ſoule can feele, is the Croſſe, vvhich is fooliſhneſſe to the vvorlde: and they thinke all the vviſedome of men, to bee but fooliſhneſſe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the meaneſt portion of that vvisdome. What meaneth this vvisedome, preached by vveake men, of the Croſſe, of a crucified man, vvhich conuoyeth life into the ſoule? It meaneth this, that the crucified man, is the GOD of glorie. Therefore holde faſt this grounde, and then thou ſhalt finde power com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from him, to quicken thy dead ſoule: and through his death, thou ſhalt get life: If hee had not died, thou hadſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſeene Life. So, all our life, and all our joye, is in his death: And therefore let this bee all our glorie, and our joye, to reſt vpon the Croſſe of CHRIST: To vvhome, vvith the Father, and vvith the Holie Spirite, bee all prayſe, honour, and glorie, for euermore. Amen.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE haue heard in this Chapter, (Beloued Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren) how Chriſt comforted his Diſciples, againſt the time hee ſhould haue vvithdrawne his bodilie preſence out of this vvorld; hee began, and ſaide to them, Be not troubled, let not your hearts be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled: As he vvould ſay, When I goe away, ye vvill find matter of trouble: be not troubled with all the things ye ſhall find: And thereafter he furniſhes them arguments of comfort. The firſt is, Fayth in him: Belieue in me, howbeit yee will not haue my bodily preſence in earth, yet ſend your fayth to Heauen, and faſten your ſelues vpon mee. The ſeconde argument, I goe away not for your hurt, but for your weale, to prepare a place for you in my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe: therefore be not troubled. The third argument, When I haue paſſed away, I will not abide for euer away; but I ſhal come againe, and take you to my ſelfe, and place you in Heauen, with my ſelfe. The fourth argument is, Comfort your ſelues with the knowledge, that ye know the place where I goe to, and the way. Pilgrimes that wander in a ſtrange Countrey, are comforted in the meane time of their Pilgrimage, that they vnderſtande the way, and the place where they ſhall repoſe themſelues: Euen ſo the Lord would ſay, Comfort your ſelues with this, that yee know the place and the way, while I come, and take you with me.</p>
            <p>After the Lord hath comforted his Diſciples, Thomas firſt, and Philip next, beginneth to doubt, and vtter their ignorance, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie concerning the place; and the way. Thomas beginneth: and hee firſt vttereth his ignorance, firſt of the way. The Lord anſwereth him, and inſtructeth him, and ſayth, I am the Way, the Verity, and the Life: no man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to the Father, but by me. Secondly, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the place, to wit, the Fathers dwelling place. If ye had known me, ſayth he, ye would haue known the Father: &amp; in misknowing the Father, ye vtter an ignorance of me. Philip vttereth his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and he ſayth, Let vs ſee the Father, and that ſhall ſuffice vs. The Lord anſwereth Philip, as hee anſwereth Thomas, with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe: Philip, ſayth he, hee that hath ſeene me, hath ſeene the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: how then ſayeſt thou, Shew vs the Father? Then hee proueth this, that hee who hath ſeene the Sonne, it behoued him to ſee the Father: I am in the Father, and the Father in me: wee are but one in Maiesty, ſubſtance, and glory: he therefore who hath ſeene me, hath ſeene also the Father. So the Lord hath brought his Diſciples
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:16631:19"/>
to the firſt ground of the knowledge of the Father: the ground is, The Sonne is one with the Father, and he is the Image of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. When hee hath reaſoned this waye with them, and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, in this Text we haue read, hee entereth into an exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: hee leaueth nothing off, that may ſerue for their weale. And in this Text, hee exhorteth them to two thinges: The firſt is, to fayth in him, to belieue him, that God dwelleth in his manly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: the Majeſtie and the glorie of God dwelleth in him bodilie. The ſeconde is, in the laſt verſe wee haue read: and it is, that they ſhould keepe his Commaundementes, if they loued him.</p>
            <p>To come to the firſt, <hi>Belieue mee,</hi> ſayeth the Lord, <hi>that J am in the Father, and hee in mee</hi>: As if hee would ſaye, Belieue this I haue beene ſpeaking, That I and the Father are one in nature, in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, glorie, and Majeſtie: Let not this baſe and infirme nature of man, that I am clad with in the world, ſtay your fayth: Looke in the thorowe the vaile of my fleſh, and ſee the Majeſtie of the great God. The Leſſon wee haue, is this: The Lorde is verie earneſt with his Diſciples, in this pointing out of himſelfe, that vnder that vaile of the nature of man, his Diſciples ſhoulde ſee the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Majeſtie of the great God of Heauen. This earneſtneſſe letteth vs ſee, it is one of the hardeſt thinges in the worlde, for man and woman, to take vp, and ſee that Majeſtie and Godhead that dwelleth in IESVS CHRIST: And it is harde for fleſhe and bloode, yea, it paſſeth the reach of all men, to belieue it, except there bee another waye, than by the eyes of nature: by the eye of nature, the ſoule will neuer perceiue, nor take vp, the glorious GOD to dwell in ſo baſe a lodging. The LORD ſayeth to Peter, (in the ſixteenth Chapter of the Euangel of ſaint Matthew, and the ſeuenteenth verſe) when hee confeſſed him to bee the Sonne of the liuing OOD<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Bleſſed art thou, Simon, the ſonne of Iona, fleſh and blood hath not reuealed that to thee, but my Father which is in Heauen.</p>
            <p>So I ſaye, to ſee the Majeſtie of GOD dwelling in earth, it behooueth man and woman to bee rayſed aboue nature, to the Heauens, to haue a Spirituall eye, and the Spirite of the great GOD, to ſee that glorious Majeſtie.</p>
            <p>Now another thing foloweth here on this earneſtneſſe to wit, A neceſsitie to knowe the Father, that wee maye gette ſaluation. Had not the LORD knowne that it was a needefull thing for his Diſciples, and for the vvhole vvorlde, that they might
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:16631:20"/>
get life, to know that the nature of God dwelt in him, hee would not haue bene ſo earneſt in this point. It is a thing that the world muſt knowe, or then there is no ſaluation. The third thing fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth: ſeeing it is ſo harde a thing to a naturall man, to ſee the glory of God, in Ieſus Chriſt; and ſeeing it is ſo neceſſary a thing to ſaluation, that except wee ſee him to bee God, as well as man, there ſhall bee no life. If euer wee would enjoy life euerlaſting, and Heauen, wee muſt bee lifted vp aboue nature, and in a manner, wee muſt be ſupernaturall and heauenly. And this change be not made in this life, let neuer man looke to ſee Heauen: that is the neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that is laide vpon thee, looke to it as thou wilt. When he hath proponed his exhortation, hee bringeth reaſons to cauſe them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue this. The firſt argument hee vſeth, is in the ende of the verſe: <hi>At the leaſt, belieue me for the very works ſake.</hi> And there were not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other argument to cauſe you to belieue this, that God dwelleth in me, looke to my workes, and ſee if they paſſe n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t the power of any creature. What Angel, or what man, can worke ſuch thinges? If my works<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bee not aboue all works, belieue not in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ee: but if it be otherwiſe belieue in mee. And there were non<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nt in the worlde, to moue men to belieue, that the Lorde <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſus is the God of glory, and that in his Manhood the Godhead dwelleth, the very effects, the words, the works, the deed: teſtifie, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hee is able to conuict all the conſcience<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of men and Angels, and make them ſay, The Lord Ieſus is the God of glory. Yea, Brethren, and there were no more to peſwade vs, that Ieſus is the God of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, but the word wee haue of Ieſus, this power of the word of the Croſſe, and this grace and Majeſty, that ſhines in the Scriptures, it teſtifieth plainly, that the Lord, the Author of that worde, is the God of Heauen: for it hath ſuch a power in the ſoules of men and women, that either it conuicteth them, or elſe it conuerteth them: and therefore it is called the power of God. And it were the word of man, that worde coulde neuer haue ſuch power to conuict the worlde, or to bring the ſoules of men to ſaluation. So, the effectes that come from the Lord, teſtifie to the world, that he is God, and is able to conuict the conſciences of all the enemies in the worlde: yea, euen of the Deuill himſelfe: But, and there bee no more, they will neuer bring thee to ſaluation. Therefore, if thou wouldeſt haue that ſolide fayth in Ieſus Chriſt, and that taſte of his ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in thine heart, thou muſt haue another witneſſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the holy Spirite muſt concur with the outwarde worde, and the outwarde
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:16631:20"/>
works, drawing, alluring, and perſwading thee, by renewing thine heart: and that bringeth with it the greateſt joye and ſweetneſſe in the world: When the Spirit is inwardly in the heart, &amp; draweth it to Chriſt, as the eye ſeeth the workes, the ſoule beginneth to reſt, and repoſe vpon the Lord, with a joy vnſpeakeable. Therfore euer preaſſe to get the preſence of that Spirite, or otherwiſe, the works will but conuict vs, and make vs inexcuſable in that great day. Yet he inſiſts, &amp; he bringeth another argument to allure them to belieue: <hi>Verilie, verilie,</hi> ſayth the Lord, <hi>belieue mee, that I am in the Father</hi>: if ye belieue this, it ſhall be for your owne weale: it ſhall not only bee for my glory, but for your weale: Yee thinke my workes great, but belieue in me, and I ſhall make you worke theſe workes, and greater than theſe. So, this argument is taken for their owne weale. Who getteth greateſt vantage in the honouring of God? Who getteth greateſt vantage in belieuing? Is it the Lorde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No, he may want thee, and all thy well-doing, and not an haire the more bee impaired of his glory: All the vantage commeth to the creature; and the glory of the creature ſtandeth in glorifying the Creator: The felicity of man and woman in earth, is in belieuing Chriſt Ieſus. So wilt thou be bleſſed, belieue. In a word, and thou belieue, the beſt is thine owne, and all the profite redoundeth to thee. What vantage bringeth fayth with it? There is not a man, or a woman, that will once belieue in the Lord Ieſus, but as ſoone his heart will be filled with that Spirit, and with all good things, and with power to worke all manner of good works, ſurmounting all the powers of nature. So, a poore body belieuing in Chriſt Ieſus, will haue more power to doe good, than all the Kinges in the world, that haue no more but nature. So it is ſaide of Steuen, that he was full of fayth, and of the Spirit, and of power: And what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth? he was ſo powerful in reaſoning, that the Phariſees could not reſiſt him: he had a wonderous working with him. And in the Primitiue Kirke, after the Lorde had ſuffered, and when hee was glorified, they who did belieue in him, got ſuch a power, that was marueilous to the world. Looke the Actes, and the laſt Chapter of Marke. So, they who belieue in Chriſt, ſurpaſſe the worlde. It is true, thoſe extraordinary and miraculous workes ceaſe now: but yet, the power that followeth on the fayth in Chriſt, abideth effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall, if not in ſuch miraculous works, as were to caſt out Deuils, to ſpeake with Tongues, &amp;c. which were in the Primitiue Kirke: Yet in ſuch workes as the worlde cannot worke. The wordes of a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:16631:21"/>
ſinfull man are powerfull to regeneration, and to renewe a dead ſoule: And it is no leſſe wonder, to raiſe vp a dead ſoule, than to raiſe a dead man out of the graue: yea, it is a greater work: And if ye wil go to works, fayth maketh vs meete to work the works of charity: And I ſay, it is better to worke a charitable worke, than ſuch miraculous workes; the one is more excellent and precious than the other. Iudas wrought wonders, but hee could not worke the works of charitie. Theſe works of charity, are as as many wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of our election, and they bring greater joye with them, than all miraculous works. When the Diſciples returned to Chriſt, rejoycing that they had wrought great miracles through his Name, the Lord ſaieth vnto them, Rejoyce rather in this, that your names are written in the Heauens. <hi>Luke,</hi> 10.17. If vvee finde the power of fayth, in working charitable workes, wee may thinke vs well: for we are lifted aboue this world, and are become Citizens in Heauen, awaiting for that redemption to come. So, I ſay, fayth is powerfull, in worde and deede: and hee who wanteth this fayth, hee wanteth power in word and deede: and ſo bleſſed is he who hath this fayth.</p>
            <p>Now there ariſeth a queſtion in the words: Some would thinke this a marueilous thing, that the Lorde will giue power to his Diſciples, to worke greater workes than himſelfe wrought. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, It is true indeed, the Diſciples of Ieſus Chriſt, after his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion, wrought greater workes, than the Lord did in his owne perſon: but it was not ſo much the Diſciples, as it was the Lorde of glory, that wrought theſe works: by the Diſciples, hee vttered his power, vſing them as miniſters. Yet ſhould not the Lorde haue wrought greater workes himſelfe in his owne perſon, than hee wrought by his Diſciples? Should he not himſelfe haue wrought greater works, when he was in the earth, than hee wrought by his Diſciples when he was in Heauen? I anſwere, No: for the Lord, ſo long as he was in the earth, was but humble, &amp; that diuine power did keep it ſelf cloſe, &amp; vttered not it ſelfe in the full meaſure: and ſo it behoued to be, that the Godhead ſhould not vtter the ſelfe in his humiliation.

               </gap> when he is glorified, in the nature of man, in the Heauen, then the power of that Godhead in him, vttered it ſelf in greater power than in the earth. And if there were no more, to proue that Chriſt glorified, wrought greater thinges by his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, than he did in his owne person, when hee was humbled; this one argument were ſufficient, that after his Aſcenſion, by their
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:16631:21"/>
Miniſterie the vvhole vvorlde vvas conuerted, vvhich came not to paſſe, vvhileſt hee himſelfe was on the Earth, becauſe the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head kept the ſelfe cloſe.</p>
            <p>But to come to the wordes following: The Lord layeth downe the ground of this: I goe to my glory, and <hi>I am paſſing to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and therefore my glory ſhall vtter it ſelfe. The power of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, muſt appeare in the vvorlde, at that time of his Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: vvhen hee went to his Father to Heauen, then the power ſtriketh wonderfully vpon the Earth, from the Heauen. When we haue the Lord Ieſus nowe glorified in the Heauen, wee haue a more glorious power of the Lord Ieſus, than the Iewes, who had his bodily preſence. So, the reaſon is, Becauſe hee was to paſſe vp to the Father. So ye ſee, Brethren, this gift the Diſciples ſhould get, that they ſhould worke greater workes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than hee did, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing prejudiciall to the glorie of our Sauiour. Howbeit it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Lord, to worke more glorious works by ſuch vveake in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentes, than hee did in his owne perſon; it is not prejudiciall to his power. If the inſtrumentes of themſelues had done theſe workes, it would haue prejudged his glorie: but ſeeing they did them by his power, it hindereth nothing his glorie. Yea, I ſay, his glorie ſeemed the more in the worlde by their working: becauſe it teſtified, that hee who was ſo baſe in the worlde, had ſuch a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in him, when hee aſcended. Hee commeth to another ground, of working of greater workes: <hi>What euer yee ſhall aske in my Name, yee ſhall get it</hi>: That is, Sende vp your prayers to mee to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, when I am glorified, and what yee ſhall aske in my Name, it ſhall be granted. So, this is another ground, wherfore the Apoſtles wrought greater works after his Aſcenſion: They prayed to him, and drew downe his power out of Heauen, by prayer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is a power incomprehenſible, that is in the Lord Ieſus. Now if any man or woman would bee partaker of that power, hee muſt ſende vp his prayer to Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by faith in him, to draw down that power to the world. Wee ſee the Apoſtles (<hi>Act.</hi> 4.) pray earneſtly, that by their handes hee would worke ſignes and wonders, and they obtained it. It is a pittie, that there ſhould bee ſo great a power in IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS CHRIST to life, and we, miſerable creatures, hauing ſo great need and want of it; ſhould haue no part of it: the fault lieth not in CHRIST: for there is power and vertue enough in him to ſaue a thouſand worldes. But this is the fault: Men and women cannot pray, becauſe they want faith. So all the want that is in vs,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:16631:22"/>
that vvee vvant Heauen, and life euerlaſting, all the fault is in our ſelues, that cannot praye, and ſaye, Lorde, there is a vvonderfull power in thee, and thou canſt ſaue a thouſande vvorldes: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Lord, by thy power ſaue mee. It is a foule ſhame, that this ſhould inlake on our parte, that vve cannot open our mouthes to ſeeke grace, ſeeing ſuch aboundance, ſuch an infinite power and treaſure is in him. And if there vvere a great treaſure to bee dealt, ſo that euerie man might haue his parte, hee vvoulde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne himſelfe vvho vvent not to gette a ſhare. Nowe there vvas neuer ſuch a treaſure, as is life eternall: and hee vvho get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not a ſhare of it, but lieth behinde ſleeping, hauing no care to gette it, hee is vvorthie a thouſand deathes. So, vve ſhould ſeeke this grace by prayer, and chiefelie that vvee maye haue the Spirite of prayer: for all men cannot ſeeke Heauen, It is a ſore thing to vs to vvant a ſhare of that rich treaſure, for fault of heartes to ſeeke it.</p>
            <p>Hee repeateth this promiſe twiſe, <hi>Jf yee aske anie thing in my Name, I will doe it.</hi> And indeede hee did it in effect: for vvhen the Lord had aſcended, they pray that they ſhould worke miracles, and ſo they did: So hee is true in all his promiſes. And marke it, Brethren: hee ſayeth, hee will doe it: and not, they ſhall doe it: for Chriſt, by his owne power, worketh miracles: the which power he communicateth not to his inſtruments, but hee reſerueth it to himſelfe: and by the miniſtery of men, powreth foorth his giftes vpon others. Then hee ſetteth downe the end of all the wonders: <hi>That the Father may be glorified.</hi> All the power of the Lord, ſerueth to the glory of his Father: All the power hee hath gotten, it dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth not the glory of his Father, but augmenteth it: and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Father ſtandeth in the power of the Sonne, becauſe he is the ſplendor of his glory: And the Sonne bee not glorified, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wanteth glory: and hee who will not glorifie the Sonne, hee will not glorifie the Father. This is not to be omitted, While hee is ſpeaking of the vttering of his power, forgetteth he the Father? No, he ſetteth downe the Fathers glory, as the end of his power. When the Lord Ieſus was in the world, he ſpake neuer a word, but he had a reſpect to glorifie the Father: And ſo hee ſayth, when hee was to goe out of the world, Father, glorifie me, for I haue glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied thee. Bleſſed is he that can with a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience proteſt this, that he euer had an eye to the glory of God: &amp; can ſay, Thou waſt mine only But, and whether I ate or I dranke, or what euer I did,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:16631:22"/>
it was all to thy glory. Wee ſhould preaſſe to doe this: howbeit wee cannot come to a full perfection: certainly that man ſhall bee partaker of his glory, that in all his actions can holde his eye on the glory of God: By the contrary, that man, what euer hee bee, and hee were a King, or a Prince, who deſireth not to glorifie God, if hee continue ſo, hee ſhall neuer ſee that glory: This ſhall ſtande, and all the worlde ſhall not bring it backe. Let this bee our marke in all our callinges, that wee may haue power to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God in them. And if wee doe not this, and though wee ſhould make all the vantage in the worlde, and heape vp great ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, gold, and treaſures, &amp;c. wee ſhall periſh miſerably. Therefore the Lord giue vs grace, ſince there is no vantage, but in the God of glory, that wee may glorifie him, and bee glorified with him, through Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now wee come to the next exhortation, which is contained in theſe wordes, <hi>Jf yee loue mee, keepe my Commaundementes.</hi> As hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them before to belieue in him, ſo now hee exhorteth them to bee obedient to him, or to doe his will: Fayth and obedience are chiefe groundes of Chriſtianitie: If one woulde bee a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, firſt hee muſt belieue in the LORD IESVS. Then next, this fayth muſt not bee ydle, but it muſt burſt foorth in the effectes: they muſt ſtriue to doe his vvill: to bee charitable, that is the LORDES vvill. In the thirteenth Chapter, and the thirty foure verſe, the Lord ſpake theſe vvordes to his Diſciples, A newe Commaundement giue I to you, That euerie one of you loue another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Being to depart out of this vvorlde, this is the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Commandement hee leaueth to his Diſciples, That in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, euerie one of them ſhoulde loue one another. So this is the chiefe Commaundement the LORD hath left vs till his comming againe, That euerie one of vs ſhoulde loue one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and euerie one of vs ſhoulde beare the burthen of another: If vvee doe not this in the abſence of the LORD, vvhen hee commeth againe, vvee ſhall not bee able to abide a triall of him, or to render an account to him of our doing. But to come to the Commaund: The meaning is, as the Lord would ſay, As ye would proteſt before the worlde, yee loue mee, make it knowne in mine abſence, by keeping my Commaundementes.</p>
            <p>Nowe, Brethren, to inſiſt vpon this matter more at large: Yee knowe this, A ſeruant, who loueth his Maſter well, hee will bee about to doe all thinges that can pleaſure his Maſter: his vvhole
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:16631:23"/>
endeuour will bee to doe the will of his Maſter, and chiefely in the abſence of his Maſter, when hee hath gone farre from home, at that time chiefely hee will kythe his loue to his Maſter, in doing his turnes with pleaſure. Howbeit loue, as the Apoſtle ſayeth, (1. <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 13.) bee painfull, yet if a man haue a true loue in his heart, hee will haue a great pleaſure alſo. Loue hath paine, but with the paine it hath pleaſure: It will not take care what paine or what tribulation it haue. So this ſeruant doing the will of his Maſter in his abſence, will teſtifie to the worlde, that hee loueth his Maſter. To draw this to our purpoſe, Brethren: The Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, the Lord of the worlde, is gone out of the worlde, as it were, to a farre Countrey, to the Heauen, and hath left vs all behinde him: yea hee hath left vs here in the Earth, and hee is abſent from vs in the Heauen: Hee is a gracious Maſter: and woe to him, vvho is not his ſeruant. Then wee being his ſeruants, and we loue him, there will bee nothing that is his will, but wee will bee about to doe it: and hee that loueth him heere in the Earth, becauſe the LORD is abſent, according to his bodie, in the Heauen, hee will bee the more earneſt to pleaſure him in his calling, and to doe the turnes of the Lord Ieſus in his abſence. Hee who loueth him, will employe his whole ſenſes, and force, and power to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure him: as Paul ſayd, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. The loue of the Lord Ieſus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraineth mee, and bindeth vp my ſoule. I ſay more: In ſuffering all extreamities for the Lord, the Fire, the Sworde, and it were a thouſande deathes, hee will haue a greater joye and pleaſure, than anie man will haue in doing anie turne for a man, whome hee loueth well. Then, woulde anie man kythe that loue hee heareth to the Lord Ieſus in his abſence? (And vvho amongſt vs vvill not ſaye, Wee loue the Lord Ieſus?) Wouldeſt thou then kythe this loue? Doe heartilie his will. It is not enough to loue in worde, but indeede. Loue not in worde onelie, ſayth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle Iohn in his firſt Epiſtle, Chap. 3. Verſ. 18. for it is the heart muſt doe the Lord ſeruice. So, and thou wouldeſt loue the Lord Ieſus, doe his will: and that is, Loue thy neighbour. And thou bee a murderer of thy neighbour, and then ſaye, I loue the LORD IESVS, I ſaye thou lyeſt, and the Lord ſayeth it alſo. Wilt thou oppreſſe the poore members of the Lord Ieſus, and ſay thou loueſt the Lord Ieſus? I ſay thou art a lyar: Good works kythe the loue in the heart. The grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of Murder, hatred, &amp;c. that is betwixt man &amp; man, is the hatred of the Lord Ieſus. So the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of all ſin,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:16631:23"/>
is the hatred of the Lord in the heart. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.40. vvhere the Lord ſpeaketh of good ſeruants, and euill ſeruants, hee ſayth, The good ſeruant, who in the abſence of his Maſter, preaſſed to doe all thinges to pleaſure his Maſter, when his Maſter commeth home, at that houre he knew not, (ſo the Lord will come when we looke not for him) and findeth the good ſeruant doing his will, will bleſſe him, and make him Ruler of all his goods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Bleſſed is hee who ſerueth the Lord in a ſmall vocation. What doeth the other ſeruant? He is ſtriking the reſt of the Familie: Woe to that ſeruant, ſaith hee, he will bee caſten out, and his part will bee with the hypocrites, who was but an hypocrite in his Maſters houſe. If we bee well occupied, and wayting aye for the home-comming of the Lord Ieſus: if we be well occupied in directing our life to him and his glory, bleſſed ſhall wee be, and wee ſhall get a portion with him in glory. But if we be euill occupied, in oppreſsion, and in wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, he ſhall caſt vs out of his Familie. To put an end to this mater: In any vocation, we ſhould al go about to pleaſure our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in the Heauen, and preaſſe to kythe it in our workes, that in our hearts we haue loued the Lord Ieſus: Wordes will not auaile: and thou couldeſt tell all the Scriptures, it auaileth not without doing. Let vs all, therefore, ſtriue to make manifeſt, that wee haue not only an outward ſhew and profeſsion of loue, but that it is fixed and ſetled in our hearts, as euer wee would deſire to finde comfort and joye in that great day of the appearance of our Lord Ieſus: To whome, with the Father, and the Holy Spirite, bee all prayſe, honour, and glory, now and foreuer. Amen.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE haue heard (Beloued Brethren) in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, how the Lord Ieſus, being to leaue the world, to aſcend to his Father, hath ſet himſelfe partly to comfort his Diſciples, who were ſad for his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, (and ſundry argumentes of conſolation hath hee giuen them) and partly to exhort them. The firſt exhortation ye heard, was, That they ſhould belieue in him, and that the Father was in him, and hee in the Father: That is, that hee and the Father were one in ſubſtance, glory, and Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie: and that the Godhead dwelt in the nature of man bodilie: And to proue this, hee vſed an argument taken from the workes that hee wrought: At leaſt, belieue mee, ſayeth hee, for the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie workes ſake which I worke: That is, Suppoſing there vvere none other argument to mooue you to belieue that I am in the Father, and the Father in mee; yet let the verie workes, wherein the properties of God are ſo clearlie manifeſted, mooue you to belieue. Another argument hee ſubjoyneth, more perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue, If yee belieue in mee, ſayeth the LORD, yee ſhall worke the workes that I worke: And I ſaye more, Yee ſhall worke grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter workes than yee haue ſeene mee working. Thereafter hee layde downe the grounde of this: For I goe, ſayeth hee, to my Father: and I ſhall come againe, in my full power, to you, and ſo worke greater workes by you, than I wrought by my ſelfe. Then hee layde downe another grounde, of the great and wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous workes that they ſhoulde worke: The grounde is Prayer, whereby they ſhould draw out of Heauen that wonderfull power: and whatſoeuer they ſhoulde a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ke of him, they ſhoulde gette it. Thereafter hee came to the next exhortation, To obey him, and keepe his Commandements. Now when he hath craued obedience at the handes of his Diſciples, hee letteth them ſee in the wordes which we haue read, that they ſhall not ſerue him for nought. No man ſerueth the Lord for nothing: but hee getteth a thouſande times better than hee giueth. What ſhall I doe to you, ſayeth the Lord, when ye ſhall be doing this? I ſhall meete you, and <hi>I ſhall pray my Father, and hee ſhall giue you a Comforter,</hi> to comfort you, <hi>euen the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:16631:24"/>
Spirit of Trueth</hi>: and that not for a daye, or a yeere, but for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, <hi>to abide with you</hi> while I come againe. Then he telleth who it is that comfortes them: It is the Spirit of God. Now becauſe theſe are great and weighty wordes, let vs conſider them: I marke firſt here, that theſe words import this: The Lord Ieſus, ſo long as hee abode with his Diſciples, and gaue them his bodily preſence, comforted his Diſciples: they had conſolation in the ſight of his bodily preſence. <hi>Ioh</hi> 6.67. vvhen the multitude had fallen away, the Lord ſaith, Will ye leaue me alſo? Peter ſaid, Lord, vvhere ſhall vve go to, for thou haſt the words of eternal life? So it appeareth, that all the joye the Diſciples had in the worlde, vvas the ſight of their Lord, becauſe they ſaw more than other men in him. Iohn ſayeth, chap. 1. verſ. 14. We ſaw him full of grace &amp; truth: And his words were ſo ſweete, that they conceiued an vnſpeakeable joye, vvhen they heard him ſpeake. So, I ſay, he vvas their comfort ſo long as hee vvas among them. What did hee more? It appeareth vvell, hee kept them as they had beene Children, from the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaultes of the Deuill, and from the malice and affliction of men. This appeareth well in the ninth Chapter of Matthew and the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth verſe, in the complaint of the Diſciples of Iohn the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt: We, ſay they, faſt and mourne continually, but your Diſciples are in joye. The Lord anſwereth, Can it bee, that the Children of the Marriage Chamber, can mourne, ſo long as they ſee the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome? That is, ſo long as they haue mee, they ſhall not mourne, they ſhall haue joye, and they ſhall feele no perſecution. Another thing yee maye ſee heere: When the Lord Ieſus vvas taken out of the vvorlde, the Diſciples beganne to bee afflicted, and to bee toſſed to and froe: for the vvordes importe this, They ſhall gette another Comforter than mee. So if they ſhall get another Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, they ſhall haue neede of another Comforter. The time ſhall come, ſayeth the Lord, vvhen the Bridegroome ſhall depart, and then they ſhall gette leaue to faſt and mourne.</p>
            <p>And to drawe this to vs: Nowe vvhen the Lord is abſent, the Deuill, and the Wicked in the vvorlde, maketh their vantage of it. The Deuill ſeeing the Lord Ieſus in the Heauen, and his poore members heere in the Earth, goeth about like a roaring Lyon to deuour them: And the Wicked of the vvorlde, ſtriue to cutte off the members of the Lord Ieſus before his comming. And the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill vvas neuer more buſie, than nowe hee is: and howe farre hee hath preuailed in the abſence of the Lord, miſerable experience
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:16631:25"/>
can teſtifie nowe, in the dayes of Antichriſt, when darkneſſe hath croppen in ſo, into the Kirke of Ieſus Chriſt. And this Age tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs, howe buſilie the Deuill worketh by his members, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the Goſpel of Ieſus Chriſt in his abſence. But we learne this comfort out of this place, Howbeit the Lord bee abſent from vs according to his bodily preſence, (yea, hee is as farre from vs, as the Heauen is from the Earth;) yet the Lord leaueth not his owne without a Comforter. This is generall: There are none that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to him, but if hee take one comfort from them, hee will giue them another. This is vnpoſsible, That the members of the Lord can want all comfort: if he take away one, he ſhall giue thee another: and if hee take away thy Children, or Wife, or Husband, or Friends, hee ſhall giue thee another comfort, as the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted his Diſciples in his abſence: So, I ſay, howbeit he be in the Heauen, he will not leaue his owne without comfort: but hee ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth downe his Spirite, to worke joye in the heartes of men and women: and the more glorious he is, ſitting at the right hand of the Father, the more powerfull will his Spirite bee. When the Lord was in the Earth, his glorious power appeared not: but as ſoone as the Lord Ieſus paſſed vp to Heauen, and entered into that place of Majeſty, then it mightily appeared. So nowe, the power that commeth out from the Lord Ieſus, is more powerfull than when he was in the Earth: And as the force of his holy Spirit becommeth greater, it muſt followe, that that conſolation that commeth from him nowe, muſt bee greater than the comfort that the Diſciples found when he was walking with them bodily.</p>
            <p>To open this more deeply: All comfort that commeth from Chriſt, it is all by his Holy Spirit. This is a ſure ground: The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort that al the Fathers had, before the Lord came in the nature of man, it was all by the holy Spirit: That Spirit of Chriſt, gaue that comfort to Abraham, to Dauid, and to the reſt. Come to the time when hee came into the worlde: The comfort the Diſciples had, was by his Spirite and Doctrine: and they in whome the Spirite wrought not, had no comfort in his ſight. The Iewes, the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, had no comfort in him. Come on yet: After his Aſcenſion we knowe all this by experience, The comfort wee all haue, is by his holy Spirite: and none haue joye, but they that haue this Spirite. And to come on yet farder: When wee ſhall come to Heauen, the joy we ſhall haue, ſhall be by the working of his holy Spirit. In a word: All the joye of the creature, ſhall bee by the holy Spirit. It is
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:16631:25"/>
not ſo much the preſence of the Lord, as it is the holy Spirit, that worketh joye in the heart. Then this muſt followe: The greater force and effect the Spirite hath, the greater is the joye: This is true. But after the paſsing vp of the Lord Ieſus to Heauen, in full glory, his Spirite had a greater force than before: For before it was ſaide, The Spirit was not yet giuen: And after hee ſaieth, It is good I depart, for otherwayes ye ſhall not get the Comforter. So I ſay, the Spirit hath greater force now, than he had then, becauſe the Lord is in his full glory in the Heauen.</p>
            <p>Brethren, all this conſolation we haue by the holy Spirit now, ſhall be nothing in compariſon of that, that we ſhall get, when we ſhall bee drawne neare hand him. Then thoſe beames of grace, thoſe glances of glory, that ſhall ſtrike from him, vvhen wee ſhall get a ſight of his glorious Majeſty: that ioye that ſhall ſhine from him, ſhall ſurpaſſe a thouſand times all the ioy we ſhall get in this world. Lord, how great a thing it is to be beſide Chriſt, glorified nowe in the Heauen! The Lord vvill transforme the creature in that ſame glory, as Paul ſpeaketh, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. So this is our joy, to awaite on the fulfilling of that ſame ioye: and it miniſtreth ioye vnto vs, to vvaite for that perfection of glory: and bleſſed is hee that hath this exſpectation: I vvarne you to looke for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming: and bleſſed is hee vvho looketh for his comming in glory.</p>
            <p>Wee haue to note in the Text, vvho it is that ſhall giue this Comforter: Hee ſaith, The Father ſhall giue another Comforter. It is ſaid in the next Chap. verſ. 26. The Sonne giueth the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter. Howe is it then ſaide, The Father ſhall giue him? There is no contradiction: for both theſe ſtand vvell together: The holy Spirit commeth from the Father, and from the Sonne: but this is the difference, the holy Spirit commeth from the Father, as from the Fountaine: for the Father is the Fountaine of the Godhead. Next, the holy Spirite commeth from the Sonne, as the ſeconde perſon: both the Father and the Sonne are at the giui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> Spirite, but they differ in order: and therefore the Lord himſelfe ſaith, That hee vvill ſend his Comforter from his Father. It is to be marked heere, The Lord attributeth to the Father the ſending of the holy Spirit: Yea, I ſay farder, Ye ſhall ſee in the vvhole Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, the Lord ſpeaking of the Redemption of man, to aſcribe it to the Father, as to the Fountaine. All the graces that proceede from him, hee aſcribeth them to the Father. That is to learne the world, All our Redemption, and all our grace, is from the Father.

Wee muſt vnderſtand, that all grace commeth from the Father, as from the Fountaine: that wee ſhoulde giue the glorie of all to him: for hee vvho is the beginner of all grace, hee muſt bee the ender. The Apoſtle conſidering this, hee ſayeth, Of him, and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row him, and for him, are all thinges, to him be glorie, and praiſe and honour, for euer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.36. The Lord Ieſus goeth before, and giueth the glory to the Father: and biddeth vs giue the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of our Redemption to the Father: but not forgetting the Sonne, for the Father, and the Sonne, and the holy Spirite, haue their owne glory in all their workes: The Father, as the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine: the Sonne, as the Mediator: the Holy Spirit, as the Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Nowe let vs ſee, howe the Spirit is giuen, and howe hee is gotten: Hee is gotten by the meanes of the Lord Ieſus: when hee was in the worlde, hee was euer praying for grace and mercy to the world. And in the ſeuenteenth Chap. ye ſhall ſee his prayer to the Father: and that prayer ſhall remaine to the end of the world, and it ſhall neuer goe out of the minde of the Father. This grace of the Holy Spirite is gotten firſt by the death of Ieſus Chriſt: and next, by the earneſt prayer and interceſſion of IESVS. Ere euer man or woman gotte that Spirite, it behooued the Lord IESVS to buye him, vvith his precious bloode: And if God had not died, the vvorlde had not gotten the Spirite. What dow a man, and hee vvere a King, and hee gette not that Spirite? The LORD meriteth that Spirite by his death. Ere euer we gette that Spirite, hee hath merited it: yea, and CHRIST muſt riſe againe, and muſt paſſe vp to Heauen, and bee glorified, and there hee muſt bee an Aduocate, and there ſitte at the right hande of the Father, and make interceſsion to his Father, to giue this Spirite to his owne Choſen, before they can gette him. So, yee ſee howe harde a thing it is, to gette the Spirite of GOD: the vvorlde thinketh it none harde thing to gette that Spirite. The Spirite of GOD vvill not come vpon a man ſleeping: No, before that Spirite enter into the ſoule, there muſt bee a ſeeking, morning and euening, to gette him. So ſayeth the LORD, Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed bee they who hunger and thirſt for righteouſneſſe, for they ſhall bee filled. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.6.</p>
            <p>Nowe to goe forwarde: Hee commaundeth his Spirite <hi>to abide with them for euer</hi>: As hee woulde ſaye, Hee ſhall bee vvith you not for a daye, or a weeke, or a yeere onely: but in all your tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and in all your afflictions, this Spirite ſhall bee vvith you:
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:16631:26"/>
hee ſhall neuer leaue you. All the thinges in the vvorlde ſhall not ſeparate thee from CHRIST, and if thou haue this Spirite. Howe ſhalt thou finde this? None ſhall take your joye from you. (<hi>Iohn,</hi> Chapter 16. Verſ. 22.) If thou findeſt joye in thy calamitie, that is a token of the preſence of the Spirite. There is no death can ſeparate thee from CHRIST: but the greater oppreſsion thou lyeſt vnder, and the greater the paine bee, the more ſure ſhalt thou bee of the Spirite, the more ſhall hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thee, the greater ſhall thy joye bee. The Martyres, vvho haue beene burned in the fire, haue felt this. This is a falſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that the Spirite of Chriſt can departe cleane awaye from them who haue once gotten him: for, as it is vnpoſsible that the death and interceſsion of Chriſt can bee of none effect; ſo as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible is it, that the Spirite of God can bee taken awaye from them that haue once receiued him: And as Ieſus Chriſt, vvho is that foundation vvherevpon all grace is builded, (for in him all the promiſes of God are Yea, and Amen. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> Chap. 1 verſ. 20.) cannot bee ouer-throwne; no more can theſe graces, that are buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon him, be taken away. The Spirit, when he is angered, and grieued in any perſon, hee will hide and with-drawe himſelfe for a while, but neuer fully nor finally: for thereafter, by repentance, he will vtter himſelfe againe: As wee may ſee in the perſon of Dauid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. This then is our comfort, that the Spirit will neuer leaue vs: And therefore let vs ſeeke to be in Ieſus, that thorow him wee may haue this Comforter to abide vvith vs for euer.</p>
            <p>Nowe in the next vvordes, the Lord ſheweth to them who is this Conforter whome they ſhoulde haue in his abſence, and hee pointeth him out in his proper name, and hee calleth him <hi>the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Trueth.</hi> The Spirite of God is called the Spirite of Trueth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as wee haue heereafter, hee inſtructeth men and women in all trueth. And in the 16. Chap. verſ. 13. Hee leadeth vs in the way of trueth and verity: We are all out of the way, till he leade vs in the way of ſaluation. There is neuer man nor woman, who is not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally full of vanity, and his heart full of lies: no trueth, chiefly in the way that leadeth to life and ſaluation: The ſpirit of errour oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupieth naturally the heartes of men and women, vntill this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Spirite enter into their heartes. The name is to bee marked: Firſt hee is called the Comforter: Secondlie, the Spirit of trueth: The one of theſe is the cauſe of the other: And the Spirite of GOD is the Comforter, and miniſtreth comfort to the ſoules of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:16631:27"/>
men and vvomen, becauſe hee is the Spirite of veritie: For, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, this knowledge of God is the grounde of all comfort: and vvithout the knowledge of our ſaluation, there is no comfort in this life: When the Spirite of God entereth into the ſoule of a man or woman, he firſt beginneth to let the creature ſee the ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that lieth in nature, the miſerie, death, and damnation that followeth on ſinne: The firſt knowledge we can haue, is to knowe vvhat we are by nature. So the firſt worke of the Spirit of Veritie, is when he letteth a man or woman ſee, that hee is but ſinfull, and dead vnder ſinne. The ſecond point of knowledge that the Spirite vvill leade thee vntill, hee vvill let thee ſee mercy, in thy deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from ſinne and death. The beſt ſight that euer a miſerable creature ſawe, and the ioyfulleſt: this ſight vvill bee accompanied vvith ſuch a ioy, as the heart of man cannot expreſſe: As the ſight of ſinne was heauy, ſo this ſight of grace &amp; mercy in Ieſus Chriſt, is ſweet: yea, the ioyfulleſt ſight that euer the creature got. The third point of knowledge he vvill leade thee vnto, is, hee vvill let thee ſee the vvay howe thou ſhouldeſt meete that mercifull God, and vvhat ſhoulde bee thy duety for ſuch a mercifull deliuerance. If any man or vvoman haue this Spirit of Verity, he muſt ſee theſe three things: and if they ſee not theſe three, they vviſt neuer what vvas the Spirite of Verity. Looke vvhat followeth on theſe three ſights: all the ioye in the vvorlde: the heart vviſt neuer vvhat ioye vvas, vvhile then. If one had all the riches in the vvorlde, all the pleaſures in the vvorlde, if they vvant the Spirite, they vvant that true ioye, in death, in life: hee that vvanteth that Spirit, can haue no ioy vvhen death commeth to him, and the vvorld leaueth him: how can he reioyce? no, he cannot. So, vvouldeſt thou haue ioye, and chiefely in the houre of death, (and that is a ſad houre) when the vvorlde is leauing thee, and thou leauing it: (for thou muſt leaue it) Get this bleſſed ſight, and this Spirite of Verity, and hee ſhall vvorke comfort in thy ſoule, both in thy life, and in the houre of death.</p>
            <p>Now againe the ſecond time he aggreageth this benefite, (for the benefite of the ſoule cannot bee aggreaged enough) before he aggreageth it, in that it ſhould abide vvith them for euer. Now he aggreageth it from the condition of the vvorld, and hee ſayth, <hi>Hee is ſuch a Spirit, that the worlde cannot receiue.</hi> The aggreaging of this benefite to the ſoule<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is by oppoſition to the vvorlde: The vvorld, ſayth the Lord, receiued not this Spirit of Verity, vvhom
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:16631:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
yee ſhall receiue. It hath a great force, the Spirite of GOD, vvhen hee vvoulde amplifie the grace that the Choſen gette in the vvorlde, vſeth to ſette downe a grace oppoſite to the worlde, vvho getteth not this grace, but in place of it, getteth miſerie. So in the threeſcore Chapter of Eſay, and the twelfth Verſe, hee ſayeth, The Lord ſhall riſe vp, and make the beames of his mercie to ſhine vpon his owne. Hee ſetteth not downe this ſimplie, but to let them ſee the greatneſſe of the benefite, hee ſubjoyneth an oppoſition: And darkneſſe, ſayeth hee, ſhall couer the Earth, and groſſe darkneſſe the people: but the Lord ſhall riſe vp to ſhine vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee with the beames of that his mercy, and his glory ſhall bee ſeene vpon thee. This is done, that the godly ſhould ſee the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the mercy of God towards them.</p>
            <p>One contrary will make another the better to be knowne. Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, wee ſee this all: the aduerſaries vſe this argument againſt vs, Your Kirke is contracted in little boundes, and your Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is but narrow, and fewe imbrace it: where yee finde one who profeſſeth as yee profeſſe, ye will find an hundreth who contemne your Doctrine: So, ſay they, becauſe the multitude imbraceth it not, it is not the true Light. But theſe wordes condemne them. The Lord ſayeth, The vvorlde cannot receiue the Spirite of Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: They ſay, The vvorlde muſt receiue the Spirite of Veritie, or elſe it is not the Spirite of Veritie. So, to ende this: Wee muſt bee ſo farre from that, to count the leſſe of this bleſſed Light, and of theſe whome the Lord vſed as inſtrumentes, after hee had taken them out of the darke Kingdome of the Antichriſt, to make this Light ſhine like the Sunne: that euen by the contrary, wee muſt count the more of it. And it is an argument, that it is the Trueth: becauſe the Lord will not communicate it with the multitude. And woe is the ſoule that neuer ſaw this Light. Precious thinges are but rare: The more pecious a grace bee, euermore ſince the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the worlde, it is the rarer. No man getteth this Light communicated to them, but thoſe ſecret ones, whom the Lord hath choſen. And we one day ſhall bleſſe this Light, that euer we ſaw it.</p>
            <p>The worde is to bee marked: <hi>The worlde cannot receiue him.</hi> This worde importeth, that the fault wherefore the worlde receiueth not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this Spirite, is not in the Spirite, but the fault is in the vvorlde it ſelfe, vvho vvanteth the hand, and ſo neither will nor can receiue ſuch a grace. The Lord in his worde offereth to all men indifferentlie this Spirite: and, as it were, by his vvorde
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:16631:28"/>
knocketh at the heartes of men, and women, to receiue ſuch a gueſt. There is none of vs who heareth this glorious Euangel, but the Lord knocketh at the doore of his ſoule, to take in this Holy Spirit, to dwell with him. But looke howe hee is anſwered: All receiueth not this Spirit, and all hearts are not opened to take him in: yea, very fewe there bee, who take in this Spirite in their heart, when they heare this Euangel. Take heed, there is no grace nor welfare, without this Spirit: and howe can the heart bee glad without him? Yet they are few who get him. To ſpeak the trueth, There is no man nor woman who is naturally borne to receiue this Spirit of God. The naturall man, ſayth Paul, is not capable of the thinges that are of God, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. So by nature, all men and women are alike. Then who maketh the difference, ſayth Paul to the Corinthians? What haſt thou, that thou haſt not receiued? (1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7.) Then if there bee a difference of men, it is not by nature: for by nature all men refuſe this Spirite. The Lord of Heauen, who offereth this Spirite to the worlde, in ſome hee will make him to worke effectually with ioy: in others, when he offereth the Spirit, he maketh the heart hard: and vvhen the worde beateth at it, it will reſiſt, and fight with both the handes, to holde backe the worde. So Steuen (<hi>Act.</hi> 7. verſ. 51.) ſaith of the Iewes, Yee reſiſt euer the holy Spirit. The multitude euer ſtriueth to holde out the Spirite out of their heartes: and the more the Spirit bee offered, the harder is their heartes. Well, it lieth in no mans hand to giue this Spirite, or to take it: There is no free will in the heart, but it is of the free will of God. So, when wee heare the worde, our whole endeuour ſhoulde bee to looke to him from whom the Spirit commeth, and ſay, Lord, it lieth not in my power, of my ſelfe, to receiue this Spirit: but, Lord, open thou mine heart, as thou openedſt the heart of Lydia, to receiue this Spirit.</p>
            <p>Now to goe forwarde: Hee ſetteth downe the cauſe wherefore the world was not able to receiue this Spirit: Hee ſayth, <hi>The world cannot receiue him, becauſe it ſeeth him not, not knoweth him not.</hi> When wee know a thing perfectly, it is good for vs: the knowledge will wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a deſire in our heartes to haue it, and to brooke it. Againe, by the contrary: And it were neuer ſo good a thing, and neuer ſo meete for vs, and we haue no knowledge of it, wee will not haue a deſire of it: yea, and it were Heauen it ſelfe: (for the common ſaying is true, <hi>Ignoti nulla cupido</hi>) The Lord ſayth to the Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:16631:28"/>
woman, <hi>Iohn,</hi> 4.10. And thou kneweſt that gift of God that is offered to thee this day: and thou kneweſt him who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth thee drinke; thou wouldeſt ſeeke of him, the water of life. The Lord meaned, ſhee asked not the water of life, becauſe ſhee knew it not: but when ſhe knew the ſweetneſſe of that water, and taſted of it; that Well of Iaakob, which ſhee thought ſo precious before, ſhe left it behind her, and ran into the Towne, and proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that grace. But to come to the particular: And a man knew how great a grace the Spirit were, he would giue all the things in the worlde, for a gripe of him, and for a taſte of his ſweetneſſe. But a man who knoweth not the Spirit of Chriſt, (for the worlde knoweth not, what grace is in that Spirite of Chriſt: ſo the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of the Spirit, maketh the contempt of the Spirit) that man hath no deſire of him. Woe to that ſoule that cannot ſaye, Lord, indue mee with thine holy Spirit: for it is a ſure thing, that thoſe who want this Spirite, they haue not Chriſt: for Chriſt is poſſeſſed by his Spirite: and when hee is out of the heart, there Chriſt is away. Euer ſeeke knowledge of God, and of Ieſus Chriſt, and of the holy Spirit, as yee would bee ſaued hereafter: And euer when yee heare any ſpeaking of this bleſſed Trinitie, bee buſie to vnderſtand what is ſpoken: Knowledge worketh a thirſt of grace: and, ſayeth the Lord, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.6. Bleſſed is hee who hungereth and thirſteth for righteouſneſſe, for he ſhall be filled. What would a man ſeeke, but his fill? In this life they ſhall get a taſte of that water of life, and heereafter they ſhall get a ſatietie: For as Dauid ſayth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.11. In thy face is fulneſſe of joy, and at thy right hand are pleaſures for euermore. So, ſtriue to get a knowledge, for it worketh a deſire: and knowledge growe not, deſire cannot grow.</p>
            <p>When hee hath laide downe the grounde, wherefore they were not able to receiue the Spirit of God; the Diſciples, who looked to the eſtate of the worlde, might haue ſaide, This eſtate of the world is miſerable: What, Lord, is our eſtate? Lie we in blindneſſe and ignorance as the worlde doeth? The Lord meeteth this, and ſayeth, <hi>Yee knowe him, and the worlde knoweth him not.</hi> And hee addeth the reaſon, He bideth with you. And he then maketh a promiſe to them of a farder acquaintance of the Spirit of God with them: he ſayeth, <hi>Hee ſhall bee in you.</hi> And then in the verſe following, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme vs, hee repeateth it, and ſayth, <hi>J ſhall not leaue you comfortleſſe</hi>: That is, I ſhall come againe to you in my Spirit. The firſt thing
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:16631:29"/>
wee haue to marke: When the Diſciples haue heard of the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable eſtate of the worlde, they are carefull to vnderſtand their eſtate, whether they bee like to the worlde, or not: and as they are carefull to vnderſtand, ſo the Lord is carefull to make them vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it: This vvorld is miſerable now, the multitude is hardened, lying without the ſheepe-folde of the Lord: So when we heare of the darkneſſe of the worlde, as of the Iewes, the Turkes, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, yea, euen to amplifie and extende this to the kingdome of Antichriſt, and of the Papiſtes alſo, for they are but miſerable: I ſay, and I proclaime, in the Name of the great God of Heauen, and in the ende they ſhall ſee it: glory in their knowledge as they will, they ſhall be caſten out in darkneſſe. When wee heare of this, I ſay, ſhould we heare of it ſecurely, as if it belonged not to vs? Or ſhould wee ſet our eyes only vpon the worlde? No, wee ſhould ſet our eyes vpon our ſelues, and trie our owne eſtate, and ſaye, Lord, what am I? Haue I ſought grace? Shall I get Heauen? This ſhould be our care, to ſee that we be not like the world: And if we be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as the Diſciples were, to ſearch our eſtate, and to trie our knowledge of the holy Spirit, the Lord will be ready to anſwere, as he anſwered them: &amp; he will ſpeake to thee by thy conſcience, Thou art not like to the worlde: Bleſſed art thou, thou haſt the knowledge of the holy Spirit. When we heare of the world, all is but miſery, multitudes lying in blindneſſe and ignorance: when we heare of this, wee ſhould not rejoyce of this, but wee ſhould bee carefull of our ſelues, and ſay, Lord, let me not bee like the world: but let mee haue a knowledge of the Lord. No, wee ſhould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the miſery of the multitude, but lament for it.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing I marke, is the waye, to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Spirit of Chriſt: Wee know all this, Brethren, when a man is acquainted with another man, and haunteth with him, the man will knowe his familiar, and knowe his power: and let them ſpeake, they will know other: So acquaintance will make know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Well, wouldeſt thou know the Spirit of Ieſus Chriſt, be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him: for there is no knowledge without familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: and hee muſt dwell with thee, night and day, ere thou knowe him. Barreſt thou him out, thou<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wilt neuer know him. So the way to know him, is onely dwelling with thee, hee muſt dwell in thine heart, and then he will let thee ſee ſuch a power, the like whereof thou neuer ſaweſt: euen the illumination of the ſoule. So he dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and working within thee, thou ſhalt know him. Our Leſſon
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:16631:29"/>
is, Dwell with vs who ſo will, and let vs dwell with whome wee vvill in this worlde, and if it were with Kinges, and wee dwell not with the Spirite of CHRIST, and hee dwell not into vs againe, vvee are but miſerable in our dwelling. So, let men looke what euer they bee doing, that the Spirite of CHRIST bee with them: ſleepe they, vvake they, goe they to their bedde, looke that hee bee with them. And in one worde, looke that hee bee a companion with thee; for otherwayes, and thou hadſt all the vvorld with thee, thou art but a miſerable ſolitary body.</p>
            <p>The wordes following: <hi>I will not leaue you Fatherleſſe, but I will come to you.</hi> It is the ſame thing in effect hee ſpake of before, to confirme them: I will not leaue you like Fatherleſſe Children. And man wanted Father and Mother, and all his Kinne, and all moyen worldly, (look how precious a thing it is to haue the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt) and hee were caſten out into the Wilderneſſe, and he haue the Spirit of God, hee is not alone, hee wanteth not a good guide in this worlde: the Spirit of Ieſus is with him, and hee ſhall loue him, that in the greateſt dangers in the worlde, hee ſhall ſaue him: and ſuppoſe hee loſe his life, hee ſhall get a better life: and ſuppoſe hee haue a battell, hee ſhall triumph: and ſuppoſe hee die, and the body bee diſſolued into duſt, the Spirit ſhall not leaue the duſt, till hee lift vp the body, and place it in the Heauen. Dauid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 146. <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. ſayeth, Bleſſed is he who hath the God of Iaakob for his helpe, vvhoſe hope is in the Lord his God. It followeth not, thou haſt not a Father, therefore God will bee thy Father: or, thou wanteſt a Mother, therefore God will bee thy Mother. It will not followe, It will not bee vvant, that will make GOD to bee thy Defender: this muſt bee, that Dauid ſayeth, Ere euer GOD bee the GOD of the Fatherleſſe, the Fatherleſſe muſt hope in him, and the Widdow muſt leane to him. Woulde the Stranger and the Fatherleſſe haue God with them, let them leane vpon God, and the Heauen ſhall fall, ere this leaning ſtocke fall: Our hope muſt bee in God.</p>
            <p>Now on the other part, Brethren, this riſeth on theſe vvordes, Let a man haue his Father, and his Mother, and all the vvorld, yet vvant he this companion, the Spirit of Chriſt, to accompany him, to goe with him, hee is euer Fatherleſſe: And hee were a King, and hee were riding in the middeſt of his troupe, and Gunnes and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons about him, hee is but ſolitary, and Fatherleſſe, and vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Guarde, and a preye to the Deuill, and to his enemies.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:16631:30"/>
Experience teacheth vs this, in all ages the greateſt men haue fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len down miſerably, vvho vvanted this Spirit to be their guarde. In one vvorde, Let all the vvorlde guarde a man, and GOD guarde him not, hee hath no guarde: All thinges are nothing vvithout GOD, and GOD is all thinges. As yee vvould bee ſaued in this life, and in that life to come, neuer reſt, night nor day, vvithout yee finde the companie of this Spirite: and ſay, and it vvere but this vvorde vvhen yee riſe, LORD, let thy Spirit riſe vvith mee, and accompany mee the vvhole daye: and LORD, let mee haue his bleſſed ſociety, that I may bee defended from mine enemies. In this broken band ſhould vvee not take vs to him, vvho hath power to defende vs? and ſhould vvee not bee acquainted vvith him, vvho vvill not leaue vs? And ſeeing there is none of vs, vvho findeth not in our ſelues a thouſand vvantes, and that vvee are ſubject to many dangers: and ſeeing hee hath promiſed the preſence of his Spirite, to all vvho vvanteth and crieth for grace, vve ought euery one in theſe troubleſome dayes, to ſeeke the preſence of this Spirit, to ſupplie all our vvantes. To this Spirit, vvith the Father, and the Sonne, bee all honour and glory, for euermore. Amen.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE heard (Beloued in Chriſt) the Lord beeing ſhortly to leaue this worlde, and to take his bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſence from it, and from his Diſciples, hee not onely comforteth them againſt that time, but hee exhorteth them, to doe their duety in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. The firſt exhortation was to fayth, Belieue mee, ſayeth hee, that I am in the Father, and the Father in mee. The ſeconde was, to the keeping of his Commaundementes. The argument was firſt, in keeping his Commandementes, they ſhould teſtifie before the worlde, that they loued him in his abſence. None loueth the Lord Ieſus in his abſence, but they who ſtriue to keepe his Commandements till his comming. The next was a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing argument, If they ſhould keep his Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements, he ſhould recompenſe his abſence: and whereas when hee was preſent with them, he was their Comforter, if they ſhould keepe his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements in his abſence, hee ſhould ſend them another Comforter out of the Heauens, who ſhould abide with them. He calleth him the Spirit of Trueth, whom the worlde could not receiue, becauſe it knew him not, nor ſaw him not; but they knew him, becauſe they were familiar with him. Then hee maketh a farder promiſe to them, that the Spirit ſhould be in an higher meaſure preſent with them after his Aſcenſion, than euer hee was before his Aſcenſion. Then hee repeateth this ſame promiſe in other wordes, and hee ſayeth, I ſhall not leaue you comfortleſſe, but I ſhal returne againe to you. Not as hee ſhall come in the daye of judgement, but in his Spirit, and in his power. So, if yee marke well, yee will ſee the Lord hath promiſed three times his Spirite to comfort them, and to abide with them: Firſt he ſaid, That he ſhould pray the Father, and he ſhould giue them another Comforter. Secondly, That that Spirit ſhould bee into them. Thirdly, That that Spirit ſhould not leaue them.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the Text wee haue read<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hee repeateth the fourth time the ſame promiſe in effect: <hi>Yet a little while, and the world ſhall not ſee mee, but yee ſhall ſee mee.</hi> That is, in my Spirit, and in that Spirite yee ſhall ſee mee more effectually, than euer I vvas of before, during the time of my bodily preſence. What mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth this oft repetition of the promiſes of the Spirit? Had it not bene enough once to haue promiſed this Spirit? Brethren, it is an hard matter for ſinners to receiue comfort: to miſerable creatures
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:16631:31"/>
to look for grace or mercy: they will be caſten in ſuch perplexitie &amp; difficulty, that in a maner they will ſee no outgate: all the words in the world will not giue them comfort. But to ripe vp the mater more deeply, &amp; to cleare how he is ſaid to come: there appeares in this Chap. &amp; in other places, three co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mings of the Lord Ieſus: The firſt was, when he came into the world, humbled into the nature of man, (a very baſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming into the world) &amp; this was the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming that the Fathers of old looked for: All the Fathers, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Adam, till Chriſt, looked ay for that firſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of the Meſſias: and it was a very hard thing to the Fathers, to look for ſuch a grace to come in the worlde: All the grace of the worlde, is in the comming of the Lord Ieſus: his preſence bringeth joye into the vvorlde: And take him awaye, there is no grace in the vvorlde. The thing in the vvorlde that Abraham vvould faineſt haue ſeene, was Chriſt: and it is ſaide, hee longed to ſee that daye: and hee ſawe him, and hee rejoyced: but hee ſawe him but afarre off. Faine vvoulde the Kinges, and the Prophets of olde, haue ſeene him.</p>
            <p>Now conſidering this hardneſſe they had, in looking for ſuch a grace, the Lord had reſpect to it. In time of olde, and from the beginning till his comming, the promiſe of his comming vvas repeated to Adam, Abraham, and Iaakob: to the people, by the Prophets: it was driuen into their eares continually, till the Lord came, and put an ende till all, and fulfilled all the promiſes.</p>
            <p>The ſecond comming, is the comming in his Spirit: After his glorious Aſcenſion, he came to his Diſciples, in the full meaſure of his Spirit, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. Now, as it appeareth in this place, the Diſciples thought it hard enough, to looke for this ſecond comming of the Lord in his Spirite: and therefore this promiſe is oft repeated to them, <hi>J ſhall pray the Father, and hee ſhall giue you another Comforter</hi>: The Spirit ſhall be in you: I ſhall not leaue you comfortles: the worlde ſhal ſee me no more, but ye ſhal ſee me. What meanes this? This fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent repetition means, that it was an hard thing to cauſe the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to look for this ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of the Lord in his Spirit: there are two co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mings paſt &amp; done: the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of the Lord in his body: the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of him, in his Spirit, is nowe come to paſſe: for all the grace we haue, is fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him in his Spirit. Reſts his laſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, when he ſhal come in proper perſon, perfectly glorified: not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming like the firſt: (for then hee came in humility) but hee ſhall come more glorious, than any King, Emperor, or Monarch, or any creature in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or in earth. Yee ſee by experience, in ſo many miſeries, it is
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:16631:31"/>
a very hard thing to looke for ſo great a grace, and deliuerance, (for he ſhall bring with him that rich reward, and euerlaſting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption) and a thouſand impediments will bee caſten in, to ſtay vs to looke for that comming, to cauſe vs misbelieue it. There is no man, that euer hath ſet his mind on that comming, who findeth not theſe impediments. No, there is none, who will ſet their eyes on that comming, but they ſhall find a cloud of darkneſſe to couer their eyes, to cauſe them misbelieue that glorious comming. The Lord hath, conſidering this well, and knowing this hardneſſe, hee hath doubled, &amp; tripled, the promiſes of his comming in the New Teſtament. And it is the will of the Lorde, that they who preach this Goſpel to the world, ſhould driue in the eares of the people, that the Lord Ieſus ſhall come once in glory. Let ſcorners ſaye what they will, one day he ſhall come againe: and when hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, hee ſhall bring the full redemption of his owne. In a worde, all our preaching ſhould bee of the laſt comming of the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, to cauſe the faythfull raiſe vp their hearts to heauen, to await for that comming: For in that ſecond comming, ſtandeth the full joye and felicity of the faythfull. So, wee ſhould euer keepe in our hearts this promiſe, that the Lord Ieſus will come, and take vs to himſelfe, that we may haue joy: And he who hath not this joy, in waiting for the comming of the Lord, he wanteth the true joye: And this ſhould be the joy of a Chriſtian, and hee ſhould ſigh and long for it.</p>
            <p>Now to come to the Text: Ere he come to the repeating of the promiſes of the comming of the Spirite, hee ſetteth downe what ſhall be the eſtate of the world: The world, ſayth hee, ſhall ſee mee no more: let me once go out of the world, the Iewes, the Phariſes, who contemned me, ſhall neuer ſee me againe: but ye ſhall ſee me. This is an accuſtomable thing to the Spirit of God, to the end the grace of God ſhould appeare the greater, to ſet it downe in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the world: ſo that when we ſee that wee get a grace, that the worlde getteth not, wee ſhould make much of it: Wee ſhoul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> make much of this Goſpel, for the world hath not gotten it: great Nations want it: it ſhould make vs very loath to want this light, and to be carefull that it ſlip not away. Woe to our Princes, and to our lordes, and woe to all the eſtates of this Land, and they let this light goe out, ſeeing the Lord hath beautified vs with ſuch grace and light, as he hath denied to other Nations, better than wee are: wee are vnworthie of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:16631:32"/>To come to the words: <hi>The world ſhall ſee me no more</hi>: meaning the Scribes, Phariſees, &amp; malicious Iewes: As he would ſay. They haue ſeene me once, &amp; contemned me: Well, for this contempt, when I ſhall goe away, they ſhall neuer ſee me again. Once contemne any preſence of Chriſt; when that preſence ſhall bee taken out of thy ſight, thou ſhalt neuer get another preſence. The Iewes had him amongſt them, and might haue ſeene him, (howbeit hee was baſe,) yet full of grace and verity: if they had looked well to him, they might haue ſeene him the God of glorie: but they would not looke to him, but contemned him: fra once he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, they neuer got a ſight of him againe. This is the thing wherewith hee threatneth the Phariſees ſo oft, Yee would faine haue mee away: Well, I ſhall goe, but where I goe, yee ſhall not come.</p>
            <p>Brethren, we haue a preſence of the Lord Ieſus, howbeit not in his body, yet in Spirit, he ſhines in his word: wee find that power and Majeſty to come downe from the Heauen, and worke in vs by his worde: wilt thou contemne this preſence? dareſt thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne it? Be thou King, Lorde, Barron, &amp;c. I ſhall giue thee this wearde, Thou ſhalt neuer ſee his laſt preſence, in his glory, but to thy ſhame.</p>
            <p>Brethren, the worlde beguiles themſelues: they will contemne the word, and that baſe kind of the preſence of Chriſt in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and they will not deinzie the word with their preſence: and if they will be preſent, they comtemne it, and will driue ouer their dayes in ſecurity: and if ye aske at them, if they will goe to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen? they will ſay, it is a fooliſh queſtion, I will bee there as ſoone as any Miniſter of them all; howbeit they contemne this worde, and this preſence of the Lord. This is like to prophane Eſau, who ſolde his part of Heauen, for the filling of the belly of him: vvhat doeth he in the meane time? paſſeth ouer the time and thinketh, he hath his Birth-right: hee looketh for that bleſsing: but vvhen it commeth to the bleſsing, it is taken from him, and it is giuen to Iaakob. So men will not thinke, that this contempt of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit will cloſe Heauen from them, vntill that latter ſentence. Eſau mourned and wept, when the bleſsing was giuen to Iaakob: but mourne as he would, hee could not get that bleſsing, but lay ſtill with the curſe on him. So, at that day, ſore ſhall the lamenting be, and we ſhall heare them, roaring, howling, and crying, vvho contemne this worde. But let them howle, and they were kinges,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:16631:32"/>
they ſhall neuer mend themſelues, or free themſelues from that eternall fire. So, as wee would ſee Chriſt comming in that day to our joye, let vs make much of this worde, in the which Chriſt is preſent: Or elſe, I giue thee doome, and thou do it not, thou ſhalt neuer ſee him, but to thy ſhame.</p>
            <p>When hee hath ſet downe the eſtate of them who contemne him, next hee layeth downe the eſtate of his Diſciples, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned him not: <hi>But,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>yee ſhall ſee mee</hi>: Howbeit that this ſight that now yee haue, bee taken away, yet ſhall yee get another ſight more comfortable. This ſight is the ſight of Ieſus in his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, thorowe his worde. The Spirit is not without the worde. And there bee no word, there is no Spirit. Contemneſt thou the word? thou contemneſt the meane that the Lord hath appointed to get that Spirit. Then the word of the Goſpel, and the Spirit that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth on the word, letteth a man or woman ſee Chriſt. Haſt thou heard the worde preached? and by the worde haſt found conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? thou haſt ſeene Chriſt, thou haſt felt and griped him. The Spirit of Chriſt, by the worde and Sacramentes, entereth into the ſoule of man and woman, and filleth the ſoule, and bringeth Chriſt into the ſoule, and filleth the whole ſenſes with him. The hands wil feele him, the eyes will ſee him. Get this Spirite, thou ſhalt get himſelfe: and when thou heareſt that worde out of the mouth of a weake inſtrument, thou ſhalt heare his owne voyce, and thine heart ſhall gripe him, euen as ſenſibly, as thine handes will gripe a ſenſible body, and thou ſhalt haue more joy, ſweetneſſe, and peace, than all the world can giue thee. Haue ye euer heard him or taſted him, then haue yee felt this joy. Howbeit wee ſee him not, yet as Peter ſayth, wee belieue, and rejoyce with a joye that is vnſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. So this fayth wee ſpeake of, and this Goſpel, is not vaine wordes that paſſe away, not a ſuperficiall thing, but the moſte ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall thin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And once thou get that Spirite, thou mayeſt feele that Spirite better, than all the things in the world: And we want this joy, the fault is not in the Spirit, but in vs, who cannot apprehend him. He ſubjoynes the reaſon why they ſhould ſee him: this is it, There is nothing that can ſlay this ſight, but death: and hee prooueth that death cannot ſtaye it: If death could ſtaye it, it
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:16631:33"/>
muſt bee either your death, or my death, but ſo it is <hi>I liue,</hi> and <hi>yee ſhall l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> for you, yee ſhall liue by the life which is in mee. The manner of ſpeaking would be marked: Ye ſhall liue, becauſe I liue. He ſayth not, I ſhall liue: but <hi>J liue:</hi> This is a weighty ſpeach: the meaning is, I liue from all eternity, my life had neuer a beginning. The forme of ſpeaking importeth a life from all eternity, a life by gone, a life preſent, and a life to come. And the Lord liueth not as the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but he is life it ſelfe, and the Fountaine of all life: therefore he liueth by himſelfe. In the end of the eight Chapter hee ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ſuch like, Ere Abraham was, I am: that is, I had my begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from all eternity: As in the Reuelation, Chap. 1 verſ. 4. I am hee, who is, was, and ſhall bee. And there were no more to teſtifie that Chriſt is God, and one with the Father, this is an argument to tell vs, that our Lord is God. There is no creature, man nor Angel, can ſay, I am: it is proper to God. <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.14. This phraſe importeth a being by himſelfe: and by him we liue, moue, and are. <hi>Act.</hi> 17.28. No creature can ſaye, I liue: onely the Lord can ſay it. So this word importeth neceſſarily, that the Lord is God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. The thing I note on this argument, is, Wee may ſee the ground of ſight, is life: and no man can ſee, except hee bee liuing: What can the eye of a dead body ſee? The ground of the naturall ſight, is naturall life: So they who would ſee heauenly thinges, muſt haue life: A dead man will neuer ſee Heauen. This life, what a life muſt it be? Muſt it be a naturall life? No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> And thou hadſt ten thouſand naturall liues, thou wilt neuer ſee Chriſt, without another life. I ſay more: This life naturall is ſo defiled with ſinne, that it hindereth vs from the ſight of Heauen: And the more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull the natural man be in his own ſight, the more are his eyes cloſed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Heauen: As Paul ſayth, The naturall man is not capable of Spirituall things, for they are fooliſhneſſe to him. The naturall man will thinke the Croſſe of Chriſt is but ſcorne: It is an harde thing for a naturall witted man, to receiue Chriſt, becauſe his head is full of naturall wit. So, ere a man get a ſight of that life, there muſt be a mortification of this corrupt nature, and wiſdome of the fleſh. And thou wouldeſt be heauenly wiſe, be a foole to the world, that thou mayeſt be wiſe. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thou muſt learne to make this worldly wit, a ſeruant to this Heauenly knowledge. So this life, which is the cauſe of ſight, muſt be the life of Chriſt:
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:16631:33"/>
there ſhall neuer one ſee Chriſt, but he who hath this life into him in ſome meaſure. A man who hath gotten a ſponke of the life of Chriſt, hee will ſee Chriſt, for hee liueth not by himſelfe, as Paul ſayeth, but hee liueth by Chriſt. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. As yee would ſee Ieſus Chriſt, bee not content to haue a naturall life, occupied in the things of the world: but ſee thou find that life of Ieſus be in thee. Reſt not night nor day, as thou wouldeſt liue, I charge thee, till thou getteſt that life, without the which there is no quietneſſe: thou mayeſt be quiet for a while, but blacke ſhall bee thy wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: and ſay thou, Lord, liue in my ſoule: for and he liue not heere in thy ſoule, thou ſhalt not get that life to come.</p>
            <p>Now, to draw to an ende: Hee letteth them ſee what vantage they ſhall haue of that ſight: It is no ſmall vantage to ſee Chriſt: In that day, would the Lord ſay, what ſhall yee ſee, vvhen yee ſee mee? Yee ſhall ſee two thinges, two vnions, in the ſight of which ſtandeth the joye of the creature: The firſt is the vnion betwixt me and the Father: <hi>J am in the Father</hi>: that is, I am God with the Father: And next, ye ſhal ſee yourſelues to ſtand in this ſocietie: That is, That <hi>yee are in mee, and I in you,</hi> to your joye and comfort. One may aske, Howe ſhalt thou ſee him vnited with the Father? A man or vvoman ſhall not ſo ſoone ſet the eye of the ſoule vpon Ieſus Chriſt, ſhall not ſo ſoone belieue in him; but as ſoone they ſhall knowe and belieue the vnity of the eſſence and glory of the Father, and of the Sonne: By fayth in Chriſt they ſhall gripe an infinite power. Who is he that belieueth in Ieſus Chriſt, vvho fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not in his heart an infinite power, and an infinite mercy? And vve feele not this, vvee feele nothing. And vvee feele not by fayth an vnſpeakeable loue, vvee feele nothing. In one vvord, vvhen one belieueth in Chriſt, they ſhall ſee in him an infinit Majeſty: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvayes, fayth could not reſt on him: for fayth can reſt on nothing, but on God. I remember, Paul to the Epheſians, Chap. 1. Verſ. 18.19. hee prayeth the Lord to illuminate the hearts of the Epheſians, to ſee heauenly thinges: and among the reſt, to ſee that excellent greatneſſe of power. There is none that belieueth in Chriſt, but they finde an excellent power. Then if fayth finde the Majeſty of God in him, the man vvill lay this concluſion, and ſay, I ſee my Sauiour is God, and is one vvith the Father: And there the ſoule getteth a ſweet repoſe to reſt vpon. So ye ſee, as ſoone as the ſoule belieueth in Chriſt, it feeleth an vnſpeakeable power and Majeſty, and ſo gathereth, hee is God, and one vvith the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:16631:34"/>
Except hee were God, and one with the Father, it coulde not bee, that one belieuing in Chriſt, coulde haue ſuch joye and peace in the heart: This is the Trueth, and hee were not God, mine heart could not haue joye in belieuing in him. So this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer wee finde ſtriking from the Lord in belieuing, telleth vs, that the Lord is God.</p>
            <p>Nowe to ſpeake of the ſecond vnion: Howe is this, that when wee looke to Chriſt by fayth, wee finde vs joyned with him, in that bleſſed ſociety? The eye ſhall not ſo ſoone bee ſet on Chriſt, and gette a blinke of him, but in him it ſhall finde the ſatiety of joye. In the face of Chriſt, is all light and joye: as Paul ſayeth, Turne the heart till him, the vaile ſhall vaniſh awaye, and the minde ſhall bee illuminated, becauſe the Lord is a Spirit, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> Chap. 3. verſ, 16.17. When thou belieueſt in him, his face ſhall ſhine in thy ſoule: thou ſhalt ſee no light, but in him. Is this the effect of fayth? What then ſhouldeſt thou gather? Thou vvouldeſt neuer finde ioye, except the Spirit had vnited thee and him. All this light, power, and ioye, which is in our ſoules, flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth from that vnion of Chriſt with vs.</p>
            <p>Then, Brethren, the ſight of Chriſt will let vs ſee the two ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulleſt ſightes, that euer wee ſaw: Firſt, that vnion betwixt him, and his Father: and ſo thou wilt ſee thy Sauiour to bee God, equall with the Father in glory and Maieſty. The next is, Thou ſhalt ſee thy ſelfe to ſtand in that ſocietie with the Father and the Sonne. Men would be in honeſt ſocietie: What more gracious, yea what more bleſſed ſocietie woldeſt thou haue, than to be in ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with the bleſſed Trinitie, in glory for euer? For this is the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie of man, to bee ioyned with that bleſſed Trinitie: euen with the Father, with the Sonne, and with the holy Spirit: To whom be praiſe, and honour, foreuer and euer, Amen.</p>

Chriſt is not a voyce, or a ſound, ſounding in mens eares, but the Lord Ieſus is in deede and effect: and there are none who haue Chriſt, but they will bee fectfull: There is not a man or a woman, who deliteth in euill, that hath Chriſt dwelling within them.</p>
            <p>When the Lord hath pointed out the man who loueth him, the Diſciples might haue thought, What vantage ſhal men then haue to loue thee? for wee will doe nothing without vantage: thy loue appeareth to be a burden till vs, becauſe thou chargeſt vs to keepe thy Commandements. The Lord meeteth this, and hee ſaieth, <hi>Hee that loueth me, ſhall be loued of my Father</hi>: he ſhall not loue me for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, my Father ſhall meet him with loue: Whoſoever loueth the Lord Ieſus, the Father loueth him: vvhoſoever hateth the Lord Ieſus, the Father hateth him: There is nothing but hatred in God againſt the Iewes and Pagans: vvho loueth not the Lord Ieſus, let him be <hi>Anathema.</hi> It vvould ſeeme by theſe vvords, Brethren, that our loue preceedeth and paſſeth before the loue of God, and becauſe wee loue him firſt, therefore hee loueth vs: But this is not the beginning of loue that is meant here: God beginneth the loue, and then we loue him: Thereafter hee meeteth vs with loue: God loueth vs ay firſt: vvhen we were his enemies he loued vs: he loued vs ere euer we were, or had any being: and becauſe he loued vs, he choſe vs. In this ſtandeth loue, fayth <hi>Iohn,</hi> 1. <hi>Epiſt. Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. not that wee loued him firſt, but that hee loued vs firſt: to kythe this, hee ſent his only begotten Sonne, to bee a propitiation for our ſinnes. So God beginneth firſt to loue vs, ere euer wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to loue him. Paul ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. The loue of God muſt bee ſhed abroad in our hearts, &amp; the holy Spirit muſt teſtifie vnto vs of that fauour that God hath till vs: and hee muſt water our drie heartes vvith a ſenſe of that loue: and then when the Lord letteth vs ſee
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:16631:35"/>
that hee loueth vs, and hath aſſured vs of the remiſsion of our ſinnes, by the death of Chriſt: then wee begin to meete him with loue. So, the loue vvee haue to God, is nothing, but like a little ſpring of vvater, flowing from that great Fountaine of his loue. Now vvhen the Lord ſeeth vs begin to loue him in ſome meaſure; vve begin not to loue him ſo ſoone, but as he began to loue vs; hee commeth about, and compaſſeth our loue. He is euer the firſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and the laſt. There is none heart able to comprehende the loue of the Lord: The loue of the Lord to his owne, is endleſſe. Paul ſayeth to the <hi>Epheſians, Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. Yee being rooted and grounded vpon the loue of God, (there is our roote, and our foundation vve ſtand vpon) yee may be able to comprehend with all the Saincts, vvhat is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height of that loue. The loue of God is infinite. The heart vvill feele the loue of God: But the heart of the ſinner cannot comprehend it in full meaſure. But to ſpeake of our loue, it is very ſober, it is nothing to ſpeake of: and except God meete this ſponke of loue continually vvith that paſsing loue, that ſponke, vvould ſoone be quenched: except he continued his grace vpon vs, our loue would ſoone vaniſh away. Wee may finde this all by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience: For vvhen God hath heaped his benefites vpon vs, vvee meete him not aye vvith loue: but our loue is like to die and eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh out of our heartes. When God hath giuen a benefite, vvho is it that at the recept of it hath his heart drawne to God? When thou haſt eaten, and drunken, and ſlept, haſt thou thine heart drawne to God? The vvorlde forgetteth God, vvhen it hath gotten the benefites of God. In a worde: Our loue is ſo ſmall and weake, that albeit hee preaſſe to intertaine it, it is like to die, and dwine awaye. It ſhould not bee ſo: For it vvill not bee vvel vvith them, and they vvere Kinges, Lordes, or Earles, vvhen they gette the benefites of GOD, vvho will not acknowledge him for them. And thinke once of the loue of GOD, thou ſhalt not loue him ſo ſoone, but thou ſhalt finde that loue of GOD in thine heart. Preaſſe to loue the LORDE, and hee ſhall ſtriue to loue thee, and ſhall not reſt to loue thee, till hee glorifie thee in the Heauens.</p>
            <p>Hee addeth to, and hee ſayeth, Not onlie ſhall the Father loue him, but the Son ſhall loue him alſo. The loue of the Father and of the Son is vnſeparable: whom the Father loueth, the Son loueth: &amp; on the contrary, whom the Father hateth, the Sonne hateth alſo.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:16631:36"/>
So, and thou wouldeſt haue the loue of the Father, haue the loue of the Sonne. Howbeit theſe two loues bee ſet downe as ſundry loues, as though the Father had one loue, and the Sonne another loue, as wee ſee amongſt men, it is not ſo with the Father of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and with the Sonne of God. As there is but one eſſence of the Father, and of the Sonne, and one Majeſtie: and as there is but one power, and juſtice, and wiſdome; ſo there is but one and that ſelfe ſame loue of the Father, and of the Sonne: and that ſame loue vvhich is the Sonnes, is alſo the Fathers: the nature of God is loue: if there be but one nature of the Father, and of the Sonne, it muſt therefore followe, there is but one loue of the Father, and of the Sonne. How then get wee the ſenſe and feeling of this loue of God? Experience telleth vs, that all the ſenſe of loue that is in the Father, is all thorow the Sonne. Neuer man yet got a ſight or ſenſe of the loue of the Father, but by the Sonne. Hee who neuer ſaw the Lord Ieſus, ſawe neuer the loue of God, becauſe hee is the ſplendor of his glory, and the image of the inuiſible God. The Iewes may ſtriue to ſee the Father, but neuer ſhall they ſee him, till they turne them to the Sonne. What man is hee that euer felt the loue of God without Chriſt? And what dow a ſinner without a ſenſe of loue and mercy? Looke if it will not paſſe thy power to haue any ſenſe of the loue of God, without Ieſus Chriſt: but when the heart is drawne to looke to him by fayth in Chriſt, then thou ſhalt get ſuch a ſweetneſſe, reſt, and joy, as cannot be vttered. What meaneth this? It meaneth, that the mercy that is layed vp for ſinners, it is layed vp in Chriſt. So, let vs addreſſe our ſelues to Chriſt, and thorowe him wee ſhall haue acceſſe to the deepneſſe of that grace in God. That then is the vantage they ſhall get who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him, to wit, they ſhall be met with a two-fold loue.</p>
            <p>Now leſt they ſhould think this loue but fectleſſe, as is the loue of the creature, he telleth them what fruit ſhall come to them there thorow: If the Father ſhall loue you, &amp; I, then <hi>I ſhall ſhow mine owne ſelfe to you</hi>: I ſhall giue you mine owne preſence. So there is the profit that redoundeth of the loue of the Father, and of the Son: Whateuer they bee, that the Lord Ieſus loueth, they ſhall ſee him by his holy Spirit, howbeit he be in the Heauens. Men will thinke this a matter of no great importance, but it is the happieſt thing in the worlde, though ſenſeleſſe ſinners thinke nothing of it, and count it of none importance. It is true, they who know not what ſinne meaneth, they who haue a ſleeping conſcience, will
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:16631:36"/>
make a little account of it, and giue them the ſight of the world, they ſhall neuer deſire to ſee Ieſus Chriſt: but the joyfulleſt ſight that euer a ladened &amp; wearied ſinner got, who ſeeketh him in any meaſure, is the ſight of Ieſus Chriſt: I ſhall make a ſuppoſition to you: If there were a man condemned to die, what would he deſire ſo earneſtly, as to get a mercifull ſight of the Prince? Nothing: for hee would haue hope of life. Now, what is the eſtate of vs all by nature? Paul telleth vs it in a word: Wee are but dead, and we are all concluded vnder ſinne and damnation. And what is it to die that death eternall? Paul telleth vs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. The wrath of God is manifeſt againſt all vngodlineſſe, and vnrighteouſneſſe of men, from the Heauen. The ſinner thinketh hee is free, when hee ſayth, and doeth miſchiefe: but he is captiue to death and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and our only deliuerance there from, ſtandeth in that merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full preſence of the Lord Ieſus, by fayth in our ſoules. Thou ſhalt die that death euerlaſtingly in Hell, and thou get not a ſight of Ieſus Chriſt. Therefore let vs all striue to ſee out owne filthineſſe: the faireſt of vs all, is filthie: wee are all but rotten ſtockes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> meete for nothing, but to be caſten into Hell. The firſt degree till hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, to a ſinner, is to feele the ſenſe of his owne miſery: A ſicke body, who feeleth not the ſickneſſe, is in moſt danger: A ſinner, that lieth vnder ſinne, and feeleth it not, is moſt miſerable: but a ſinner, that feeleth ſinne, and groneth vnder the burthen of it, getteth a gracious ſight: A ſad ſinner, getteth the ſight of the Lord Ieſus his deliuerer. Dauid was glorious, yet hee counted nothing of all, if hee wanted the ſight of the face of God. Lift vp the light (sayth he, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. <hi>verſ.</hi> 6.7.) of thy countenance vpon me, and giue mee a ſight of thy face, and I ſhall bee more joyfull in heart, than they will bee, when their Wheate and their Wine did abound. Therefore preaſſe to feele ſinne, that thou mayeſt ſeeke the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Ieſus.</p>
            <p>When the Lord ſpake this, one of his Diſciples entred in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with him, named Iudas, not the traytor, but a kinſman of the Lord Ieſus, who wrote that Epiſtle of Iude which is nowe extant: hee asketh a queſtion, <hi>Wherefore is it, that thou wilt make thy ſelfe manifest to vs, and not to the world</hi>? As hee would ſaye, Is there not grace enough? is there not mercy ſufficient in thee to the whole world? Why art thou then ſo ſparing of it, that ſo many die with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fayth? Is there not grace enough in Ieſus Chriſt, to ſuffice a thouſand worlds? Why will then God make a choyſe? See the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:16631:37"/>
maruelling of the vvorld: Men conſidering there is ſo great grace and mercy in Ieſus Chriſt, as maye ſaue a thouſande worldes, they ſay, Why is it that ſo fewe are ſaued in the vvorlde? The Lord is not carefull to anſwere the queſtion, becauſe it was more curious than profitable. The world wondereth at the ſame this daye: but there is none occaſion of wonder. It was no wonder that God in his Iuſtice ſhoulde caſt all men into Hell: but the wonder is, that God is ſo mercifull to miſerable mankinde, that hee ſhould ſende his onely Sonne to die for any: And the Angels maruell at this, and deſire to looke in into that myſtery, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. And this is the wondering of the godly, that euer they ſhould get mercy. And this was the wondering of Paul. Wonder and thou gette Chriſt: thou haſt cauſe to wonder, that euer hee ſhoulde haue ſaued thee. Paul, <hi>Rom.</hi> chap. 9. verſ. 19. vvhere he ſpeaketh of the eternall ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and the eternall reprobation, hee ſayeth, I hated Eſau, and I loued Iaakob, before the foundation of the worlde. The reaſon of man commeth in, and ſayth, Then God is vnjuſt: what was in Iaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kob, more than in Eſau? There is our reaſon wee make. No, holde thy tongue, ſayth the Apoſtle, It was the will of God: hee giueth not another cauſe: on whom he will, he ſheweth mercy, and whom he will he caſteth off.</p>
            <p>Our Leſſon is, Whether in time, after men bee come into the vvorld, it pleaſeth God to giue his preſence to ſome, and to denie his preſence to ſome other: We ſhould not bee curious in this, but glorifie God in his mercy, to vs, vvho haue found the preſence of the Lord Ieſus, and in his juſtice towards the wicked. Or, vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou goe higher, and conſider his election and reprobation, from all eternity. Be not curious to inquire, or to reaſon, but kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing that it was the will of God, ſaye, Bleſſed bee thy will, O Lord, thou made the creature, glorifie thy ſelfe in the creature. Reaſon not with him, but count all that hee doeth juſt: and thou vvho canſt count reuerently of God, thou ſhalt reigne with him. The reprobate commonly chideth with God, and is curious in theſe thinges: But as for the regenerate man, hee reuerenceth the vvill of God, and giueth him all honour, and glory, in all his vvorkes, vvhether from all eternity, or in time, albeit hee perceiue not euident cauſes thereof. Therefore ſpeake thou reuerently of thy God, and thinke reuerently of hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, that thou with him mayſt reigne in glory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:16631:37"/>Now to goe forward. In the words following he anſwereth Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das: and marke well, hee will not giue a direct anſwere to the queſtion: but leauing to anſwere to that curioſitie, hee followeth foorth his exhortation, and ſayeth, <hi>Hee who will loue mee, will keepe my Commandements.</hi> Leaſt that ſhould ſeeme a fectleſſe thing to keep his Commandements, he ſayth, <hi>J ſhall loue him</hi>: and leaſt this ſhould ſeeme fectleſſe, hee ſayth, <hi>The Father ſhall loue him, and I, and the Father, will come, and dwell with him.</hi> This all was exponed in effect alreadie. The Lord hee giueth not an anſwere to this curious queſtion. Hereby he learneth vs, that we haue nothing adoe to be curious in queſtions, in ſearching out the ſecret will of God. It is ouer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous a thing to vs to inquire that which is not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the Angels: they will not get leaue to ſit on his ſecrete counſell. Doe as hee commandeth thee to doe: aske not, why hee biddeth thee.</p>
            <p>To come to the purpoſe wee haue in hande: Wee ſhoulde not bee ſo curious to aske, vvhy will not the Lorde ſaue the vvorlde? as to enter into the waye of ſaluation our ſelues, and to ſee that wee keepe his Commaundementes, and loue him, that hee may loue vs: and louing vs, hee may come, and abide with vs: and that not for a ſhort ſpace, but for euer. Wee ſhoulde enter into the way to get his preſence. Chriſtian Religion ſtandeth not ſo much in curioſitie, or in ſpeaches, as in the ſenſe of the heart, &amp; in a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſing of that loue of the heart, in the life and conuerſation. The Apoſtle Paul, in the fourth Chap. to the Epheſ. verſ. 22.24. telleth vs, what it is to learne Chriſt, euen to put off the olde man, and to put on the newe man. This for the anſwere. Yet hee inſiſteth in that, that they ſhould keepe his Commaundement: No, it cannot bee preached enough to keepe the Commandement of Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our nature is ſo backward. And as before he pointed out the man who loued him, ſo now he pointeth out the man who loueth him not: and that is he <hi>who keepes not his Command</hi> and bleſſed word, that he hath giuen for our weale. Who is it then who loueth him not? hee who keepeth not his Commandes. Marke, when yee ſee a man taking pleaſure to diſpleaſe God, and leading a life directlie contrary to the will of God; point out that man, and ſaye, This is a man who hateth God in his heart. Iudge not of a man by his tongue and ſpeaches: for oftentimes hee vvho doeth vvorſt, ſpeaketh beſt. Aske at an hypocrite, if hee bee a Chriſtian or not? hee will bee angrie with you, becauſe hee not ſeeing himſelfe,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:16631:38"/>
thinketh himſelfe as good as any other: (It is an eaſie thing to the tongue to cloake the filth of the heart of the hypocrite.) And vvhat will his hand be doing then? It will be vttering it ſelfe in a filthie life. So take not vp the diſpoſition of the heart of man or vvoman by the tongue, but by the hand: for the hand will ſaye to the tongue, Tongue, thou lieſt. <hi>John,</hi> 1. Epiſt. Chap. 2. Verſ. 4. If any ſay, I know God, and keepe not his Command, he is a lyar, and the trueth is not in him. And againe, Chap. 4. Verſ. 20. If any man ſay, I loue God, and hateth his brother, he is but a lyar. Who is it that controlleth the tongue? and teſtifieth before the world, that the heart is but falſe? It is the hande, and the worke: the tongue is but a cloake of falſeneſſe. Marke a faythfull man by his h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nde, and not by his tongue. Our Lord ſayeth, in the ſeuenth Chap. of Matth. and the eighteenth verſ. It is vnpoſſible that an euill Tree can bring foorth good fruit.</p>
            <p>Yet he inſiſteth in this matter, for hee is very earneſt to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende this obedience to his Diſciples, and to vs all: and hee fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth the laſt argument whereby they ſhould be moued to keep his Commandement: and he leadeth them vnto that Fountaine of all his wordes, vvhich was that glorious Majeſtie of his Father: The word, ſayth he, vvhich yee heare, is not mine, but the Fathers vvhich ſent mee. Would yee haue the ground and fountaine of all fayth? of all obedience? of all well-doing? and of all ſecuritie in this life? The ground of all, is the onely mouth of the Father. So that when a man vnderſtandeth that word that hee ſhould belieue into, it is not the worde of man, but that Verity that floweth from the mouth of the Majeſty of God: then the heart gripeth vnto it, &amp; belieueth: then the hand executeth it: then there followeth obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: But when the heart is not perſwaded, that the word flowes from that mouth of God, but from man, then the heart will draw abacke, it cannot belieue, and the life will not follow it.</p>
            <p>Then Chriſt learneth vs here, If wee would haue the people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuing, and obeying his worde to drawe their eares to heare the Lord ſpeaking, and then the hearts of the faythfull will receiue it vvith joye, and practiſe it. Away with all the wordes of men, of all creatures, of all Angels: they cannot bee a ſolide grounde to our fayth: neither can the authoritv of the Kirke bee a ground to our fayth, albeit the fooliſh Papiſts affirme, that the cauſe wherefore vve belieue the Scripture, is, becauſe the Kirke ſayth, it is the word of God: for except the Scripture bare witneſſe of the ſelfe, that it
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:16631:38"/>
vvere of God, and the word of God, truely the authoritie of the Kirke could neuer make vs belieue, nor perſwade vs the ſame: For the ground of our fayth muſt bee the voyce and teſtimony of God himſelfe ſpeaking to vs. Onely this word of the Olde and Newe Teſtament, vvherein God himſelfe ſpeaketh, is able to eſtabliſh our fayth.</p>
            <p>The Lord when hee hath exhorted them, perceiuing that his vvorde tooke not that effect in the heartes of his Diſciples that it ſhould haue done, notwithſtanding all his gracious ſpeaking (for he knew their hearts) he meeteth this, and he ſayth, <hi>J haue ſpoken theſe thinges being preſent with you</hi>: And howbeit they bee not ſo effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall in you for the preſent, bee not diſcouraged: for when I ſhall paſſe to the Heauen, <hi>the Comforter, which is the holy Ghoſt, whome the Father will ſende in my Name, ſhall teach you all thinges, and hee ſhall call theſe wordes to your remembrance, which J haue tolde you.</hi> We may learne here firſt the word hath none effect in the heart, without the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit accompany it. Let it bee the worde of God, and flowe out of the mouth of God, yet and hee concur not with the worde by his Spirit, the word ſhall worke none effect in the heart.</p>
            <p>There are two Doctors who teach vs: one Doctor outwarde to the eare, and another inwarde, that is, the Spirit, vvho mollifieth the heart: Let the outwarde Doctor ſounde neuer ſo long in the eare, if the inwarde concur not, the worde ſhall doe no good: And except that Spirite open the eye of the ſoule to ſee, and open the heart, as he opened the heart of Lydia, (<hi>Act.</hi> Chap. 16. verſ. 14.) to receiue that ſeede of the worde, the heart ſhall bee as a cloſed Booke, and harder than it was of before. Marke another thing: The Spirit of the Lord Ieſus will not accompany the worde at all times, no, not in the hearts of the faythfull themſelues: The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were a proofe of this: Howe much ſpake the Lord to them vvhen he was in the world? and how little effect tooke it in them, till he went to the Heauens? In the 29. chap. of Eſay. verſ. 11. ye reade, the word of the Lord is like a cloſed book to the vnfaithful. Nowe this is true likewiſe, the worde of God to the godly ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is like a cloſed booke: and they will haue ſuch a hardneſſe at times, that they will haue no ſenſe of it; not to indure them, but to humble them.

Peter, in his firſt Epiſt. chap. 1. verſ. 23. he calleth the ſeed of the word an immortall ſeed. It will neuer die: it may be choaked, &amp; holden down: It can no more die, ſaith Peter, than God can die. So of neceſſity, in the ende, when it ſhall pleaſe God to waken that word, by his holy Spirit in the heart, then it ſhall afford ſolide joy and conſolation till vs: theſe ſentences ſhalbe called to our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, which wee heard before without fruit and edification. We haue found this in experience, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man or woman hath moſt adoe in affliction, this ſame very Comforter will come to the heart, and renew the remembrance, and will cauſe them to haue a joy in that word which they heard before with deafe eares. And this is true, that at the laſt hee ſhall comfort his owne with that worde which they hearde with deafe eares: for the worde cannot paſſe awaye without ſome effect. Hee ſayeth, The holy Spirite <hi>ſhall teach them all things.</hi> We know, he who teacheth, is called a Teacher: yet when he ſayth, The holy Spirit ſhall teach, he calleth him not a Teacher, but a Comforter, becauſe al his doctrine tendeth to conſolation. There is no comfortable doctrine, but that doctrine of the holy Spirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly working in the ſoule. We will ſay, Men will teach comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table doctrine: but all the comfortable doctrine we heare, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of this, that the holy Spirit accompanieth their doctrine, and worketh comfort inwardly. If thou haſt anie conſolation inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie by teaching, thou mayeſt rejoyce, and bee aſſured, that thou haſt a glorious Doctour, euen the third perſon of the Trinitie, in thine heart, There is no conſolation in the outwarde Teacher, without him, <hi>whome the Father ſhall ſende in my Name.</hi> The Father ſendeth the holie Spirite in the Name of the Sonne, and ſendeth that Spirit by his Sonne, as Mediator. The Spirite and all his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, floweth till vs from the Father, but mediatelie thorowe the Sonne, as a mediate perſon.

Next, I call the word of Chriſt, that which he ſpake himſelfe in the worlde. Thirdly, that which the Apoſtles ſpake. Laſt, I call the worde of God, the Scriptures of the Olde and New Teſtament, vvhich the Lord hath regiſtrated in his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: And take it awaye, miſerable darkneſſe ſhall come vpon the vvorlde: Let it ſtand, giue it the owne power, it ſhall ſhine like light vnto the worlde. They will ſaye, it hath not all that Chriſt ſpake, and that the Apoſtles ſpake. I anſwere, The Lord Ieſus ſpake nothing, nor his Apoſtles ſpake nothing, but all in effect is contained in this written word. There is not a word that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Ieſus ſhall ſpeake vnto thy ſoule, but onely that which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrated in the Olde and New Teſtament. That Trueth ſhall ſtand inſpite of the world. This place therefore confuteth all them that are enemies to the Scriptures. Mahomet began, &amp; ſaid, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was imperfect: The Pope brought in mens Traditions, to ſupply the wants of the Scriptures. Others, as the Anabaptiſtes, awaite on that reuelation of the Spirit, beſides that reuelation of Ieſus Chriſt in his worde: But inſpite of them, they ſhall get none other reuelation: nor the Spirit ſhall accompany no word but that

The Lord accompany his worde with the preſence of his Spirite, that Comforter, in our ſoules inwardly, till his comming in the Cloudes, and we ſee him face to face: To whom bee praiſe, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and glory, for euer and euer.

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the beginning of this Chapter, Brethren, Chriſt began to comfort his Diſciples againſt the time hee was to with-drawe his bodily preſence from them: and he continued a while in comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them: and then after he beginneth to exhort them, Firſt, to belieue in him: and next, to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to keepe his Commaundementes: and hee inſiſted chiefely in this, That they ſhould keepe the worde hee ſpake vnto them in his abſence. Now in the beginning of theſe
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:16631:40"/>
wordes wee haue read, the Lord returneth againe to that conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation that he began with: to wit, That they ſhould not bee trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in his abſence. The argu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ent is taken from that peace hee leaueth with them: Seeing I leaue peace with you, what need yee to bee troubled? Weigh the wordes, for they are weighty, <hi>Peace I leaue you,</hi> ſayeth the Lord: No queſtion hee alludeth to that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon faſhion of ſalutation that was vſed amongſt the Ieweſt in their meetinges and departinges, wherein they wiſhed peace one to another: by the which word they vnderſtood all kind of proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie, in thinges earthly and heauenly. So the Lord would ſay, I am now to depart from you, but I leaue ſomething behind mee to you, to wit, my bleſsing &amp; proſperity for euer. Now leaſt it ſhould haue bene thought, that he left peace vnto them no other wayes, than the men of this world vſe to do, he ſubjoyneth, <hi>My peace I giue you.</hi> There is an emphaſis in theſe wordes, <hi>My peace,</hi> and <hi>I giue you it</hi>: As the Lord would ſaye, Men may well wiſh peace to men: but it lieth in no mans hands to giue peace: there is no Angel in Heauen able to giue peace: but I, ſayeth the Lord, ſhall <hi>giue you it</hi>: I am not only, ſayth the Lord, a wiſher, but a giuer: There is no man able to giue his owne peace, becauſe no man hath peace to giue: Men may wiſh peace from God, as to the <hi>Philipp.</hi> 4.7. It is called the peace of God. None of the Apoſtles will ſay, My peace: but the peace of God: and therefore hee is called the God of peace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.20. The Lord Ieſus hath peace to giue, as the Father hath peace: Yea, more, he would ſignifie by this peace, not a common ſort of peace, but an inwarde peace of conſcience, the reſt to the ſoule of a ſinner, that peace that paſſeth all vnderſtanding, <hi>Philipp.</hi> Chap. 4. Verſ. 7. The reſt of the ſoule, as ye may reade in Matthewes Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, Chap. 11. Verſ. 29. where Chriſt ſayeth. Come vnto mee all yee that are weary, and laden, and I will eaſe you, and yee ſhall finde reſt to your ſoules. Take this peace away, there is no reſt to the ſoule. This peace is called Chriſtes peace, becauſe it floweth from him immediately till vs, that wee may haue a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that we may haue aſſurance of the remiſsion of our ſinnes: for herein ſtandeth chiefelv a good conſcience, when it ſayeth, thy ſinnes are freely forgiuen thee. Wee knowe this good conſcience ſtandeth in fayth thorow the blood of CHRIST. Take awaye the blood of CHRIST, there is no conſcience that is good. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. The blood of Chriſt purgeth our conſcience from dead works, to ſerue the liuing God: that is, it purgeth vs from our ſins.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:16631:41"/>
So ye ſee this, that all the joy of the ſoule floweth from the blood of Chriſt Ieſus: and therefore worthily he calleth it his peace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it commeth thorow his blood: vvithout the which peace, there is no reſt, howbeit yee had all the peace of all the Princes of the worlde: Let the Traytors haue the Kinges peace, and let them vvant this peace; let them paſſe as they will, they haue no peace.</p>
            <p>Yet he inſiſteth the third time, and ſubjoyneth, <hi>Not as the worl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e giueth, giue I it.</hi> He marketh the manner of the giuing, and maketh an expoſition of the giuing of it. Worldly men will take vpon them to giue peace, but the worldes peace is but for a faſhion: the mouth will wiſh peace, and the heart will curſe: this is the peace of the world: That peace of the world is ſo fectleſſe, that ſcarcelie vvill a man wiſh that peace from his heart. As the Lord woulde ſay, I ſpeake not only with my mouth, but from mine heart I wiſh it, and I ſhall effectuate it indeede. A man may wiſh well, but it vvanteth effect. Yee ſee now this three-folde repetition. Will yee vveigh the words, yee ſhall finde a wonderfull intier loue, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable heartineſſe, vttered by the Lord in his Farewell. Theſe vvords let vs ſee, that he not only leaueth peace and loue behinde him, but his very heart. Beſides all the grace wee haue of Ieſus Chriſt, they who loue Chriſt, they haue his heart. Looke how ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly he loueth faythfull men: howbeit hee bee in the Heauen, yet he leaueth them his very heart, and inwarde affection: there is an vnſpeakeable loue.</p>
            <p>Now when he hath taken his good-night, he concludes, Seeing I haue left you peace, and I giue you it, vvhat then needeth <hi>you to bee troubled</hi>? Marke then this concluſion: Where the peace of the Lord is not, there the ſoule of man hath no reſt, there is nothing but trouble and griefe there. It is true, great ſinners, vvho vvill haue no part of Ieſus Chriſt, vvill haue ſome kind of reſt, and who vvill bee ſo merry as they? (Bloody murderers, vvicked blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, and vile adulterers, vvill by appearance haue peace.) But, Brethren, this is but a falſe peace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and aſſuredly it is better a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times, to haue an vnquiet and reſtleſſe ſoule, than to haue a ſecure life: for a ſenſeleſſe carnall ſecurity, is a ſure token of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den judgement to come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Paul, in his firſt Epiſtle to the Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, Chap. 5. Verſ. 3. ſayeth, When they ſay, there is peace and ſafety, then ſhall come vpon them ſudden deſtruction, as the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell vpon a vvoman with child, and they ſhall not eſcape. The loune will bid cloze the yates, and bid watch: let him bid as hee
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:16631:41"/>
vvill, the judgement of God ſhall not paſſe by him, and his yates ſhall not holde out the wrath of God, but it ſhall come on him, as the paine commeth on a woman in the time of her birth. So, in one vvorde, they who want this peace, they haue no peace: No peace to the wicked, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 57. By the contrary, vvhen the Lord Ieſus gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth peace to the heart of a ſinfull man or woman, vvhoſe heart is troubled, then the heart of a ſinner hath peace. I put the caſe, that a man were in great danger, euen at deaths doore, yea, and he were in the fire; and the Lord Ieſus giue him his peace, and ſaye, I giue thee my peace, then the ſoule ſhall be in exceeding joye. Tyrantes haue marueiled, that the Martyres who ſuffered for Ieſus, ſhould haue had ſuch a joye as they had. So, if the Lord Ieſus will once ſay, My peace I giue you, then the ſoule will reſt on him with ſuch a joye as is vnſpeakeable. So the Apoſtles felt this indeede. In one vvorde, the peace of Ieſus Chriſt guardeth the ſoule, and maketh it ſure: as Paul ſayeth to the <hi>Philipp. Cha.</hi> 4. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7. Thus farre now hath the Lord comforted his Diſciples.</p>
            <p>Nowe in the next Verſe hee beginneth to ſpeake more ſharply, and hee, as it were, findeth fault with them, that they loued him not well enough: and they vttered it, in that they were ſo grieued and diſpleaſed at his departure. This forme that the Lord vſeth, teacheth vs this, that in comforting of heauy hearted ſinners, (Who ſhould bee comforted, but the heauy hearted?) thou vſe gentle reproofes: for the heart that is heauy and ſad, vvill hardly take conſolation, but will delite in ſadneſſe. Looke howe yee ſhall comfort them: not to holde vp the heart aye with comfort: but reproue it with ſome piece of ſharpneſſe, as it were. So Dauid in the 42. <hi>Pſal. verſ.</hi> 11. vvhen he findeth himſelfe carried away with a vehement affection of ſorrowe, and ouer farre caſten downe in his exile, he ſayth, Why art thou caſten downe, my ſoule? and why art thou diſquieted within mee? vvait on God, for I will yet giue him thankes, &amp;c. So wee ſhould preſſe downe the affection with a reproofe, as the Lord doth here. Hee layeth downe the ground of his reproofe, <hi>I tolde you, J would goe away, and I tolde you, I would come againe</hi> in my Spirit: <hi>and now I am to depart to my Father.</hi> Now, he ſaith, yee loue me not, becauſe ye rejoyce not that I am to goe to glorie vvith my Father: for my Father is greater than I: that is, I goe to be partaker of that glory which the Father hath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when as yee are ſad at my departure, ye vtter that yee enuy my glory. Marke the wordes: Heretickes who a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>leadged that Chriſt was a God, but
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:16631:42"/>
created in time, and not equall with the Father. Though they got a great vantage out of this place, <hi>The Father is greater than J</hi>: The Fathers of olde exponed this place well, That it was to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the humane nature, and not of the diuine. Yet there is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other expoſition of this, that is, That this place is not ſo much to bee vnderſtood of the nature of Chriſt, as of his office: The God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of the Lord Ieſus, the Sonne, being equall with the Father, taketh an office vpon him, by the which he beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth inferiour to the Father: to wit, hee beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth Mediator: The office ſtandeth in this, He taketh vpon him the fleſh of a ſeruant. Next, he beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth obedient, yea, euen to the death of the Croſſe, in that nature: ſo in reſpect of this office, he maketh himſelfe inferior to the Father. By this we muſt not gather, that he was inferior to the Father in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Majeſty, or eſſence; howbeit in office hee was vnequall &amp; infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to the Father: For as that reuerent Father <hi>Cyrillus</hi> ſayeth, <hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiò &amp; obedientia non tollunt aequalitatem potentiae, &amp; eſſentiae.</hi> Therefore ye ſee, the Heretickes, as namely, <hi>Arrius,</hi> out of this place haue no ground for that blaſphemous hereſie. But conſider yet more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly what the Lord ſaith, <hi>And ye loued me, ye would haue reioyced, in that I ſaid, J would depart.</hi> As he would ſay, The very wordes that yee turne to your diſcomfort &amp; ſorrow, ſhould haue bene mater of joy and comfort. There is neuer a word that the Lord ſpeaketh to his owne, no, neuer one, but in them all is matter of joye: howbeit the words will ſeeme ſharpe, yet all the words of the Lord that he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to his, tende to their joye and conſolation: and all they that loue the Lord Ieſus, ſhould conſtruct all the deeds &amp; words of the Lord to their comfort: let him take away worldly riches, honour, health, friendes, life it ſelfe, &amp;c. all ſhould work comfort to them. But, brethren, we are ſo corrupt &amp; blind by nature, that we ſee not the Lords purpoſe, &amp; what he is doing to vs: &amp; we make the words of the Lord, wherin we ſhould take pleaſure &amp; ioy, to be mater of diſpleaſure, I ſpeak not this, to take away ſenſe of the ſharpneſſe of the Lord, &amp; to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend <hi>Sto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now the Lord craues this, that with bitternes we ſhould taſte ſweetnes: indeed heauines is the comlieſt thing that can be in a Chriſtian, &amp; ſadnes beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth a ſinner well: but in the mean time there ſhould be joy in the ſoule. 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Reioyce euermore.</hi> He findeth no fault with them, that they were ſad, but becauſe they would receiue no comfort. He ſaith, <hi>Jf ye loued me, ye wold reioyce, because I ſaid, I go to the Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> One who loueth another
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:16631:42"/>
truly, will reioyce in the weale of the other. Loue bringes a rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing: he or ſhe that loues Chriſt, that gets greateſt joy in the hart, as enuy eats vp the hart of man or woman, in whom it is: one who loues another, will reioyce at the good eſtate of the other, at his proſperity, riches &amp; honor: one who loues the Lord Ieſus well, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyces to ſee him glorified: &amp; that ſhold be our joy to ſee the Lord Ieſus glorified, &amp; his kingdome aduanced: &amp; curſed be thou who laughs at the down-throwing of the kingdom of the Lord Ieſus: no, they who loues God, will curſe all their kin: &amp; as he ſayes here himſelf, <hi>they who loue the Lord Ieſus, their delite ſhall bee to ſee him glorified.</hi> Th' Apoſtles not taking ſuch ioy as they oght, to ſee him glorified, their loue was prepoſterous: no doubt they loued him intierly, <hi>Peter</hi> loued him, <hi>Iohn</hi> loued him; &amp; the reſt loued him; yet the Lord ſhewes that their loue was with a great ignorance, &amp; the fleſh was mixed with it, it was not ſincere. So let vs tak heed to our loue: not only to that loue we beare to Chriſt, but euen to men, man to wife, parents to children, we ſhould take heed that it be a true loue, and not a prepoſterous loue: I call it not a true loue, that hath nothing but ſadnes with it for the death of another: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Chriſtian goes to ioy, and when we are ſad for them, then we vtter an enuy in our heartes of their glory. Indeede wee ſhould not want naturall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: and wee may haue diſpleaſure for the want of our brother: but looke that diſpleaſure bee not for thy brothers joye, and that hee is participant of that glorie with Chriſt, and the hope of that Reſurrection. The remembrance of the aſſembling of the Sainctes of God, to meete their Head in the Cloudes, ſhould cauſe thee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce. The Lord lift vp our heartes to the Heauen from this earth, whereon we are ſo fixed: and make vs to waite continually for that bleſſed aſſembly of the Sainctes; that when hee commeth in the cloudes, we may be carried to remaine with him in ioy for euer.</p>
            <p>Now in the words following the Lord ſetteth downe the ende of his ſpeaking to his Diſciples, and chiefely of this, that he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warneth them that hee was to depart. Heere is the chiefe ende, <hi>That they ſhould belieu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> in him, that hee was that promiſed Meſsias, the Sonne of God: &amp; when they ſhould ſee the accompliſhment of all his ſayings, that they ſhould belieue. The whole word of God leads vs to this, that men ſhould belieue in Ieſus Chriſt, there is not a word ſpoken in the Scripture, but it leads vs to Chriſt, whether the Lord ſpeak of things to come, as in the Prophets, or of things done, as in the Evangels, all tendeth to this, to leade vs to Ieſus
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:16631:43"/>
Chriſt, to belieue in him: They who get not this end in the word, they get no fruit of the word. Hee ſayth not, Theſe things I tolde you before the hand, that ye ſhould belieue: But he addeth, I haue told you them before the hand, <hi>that when they come to paſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ye ſhould belieue.</hi> The perfection of fayth ſtandeth not in fore-telling, but in accompliſhment. It is true, the fore-ſpeaking of the thinges of Chriſt to come, hath force to worke fayth in the heartes of men and women: All the godly men and women before Chriſt, had nothing but fore-telling of Chriſt, that hee was to come into the vvorld: and vpon theſe fore-tellings they belieued. So the predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Chriſt in all time wrought fayth in the heartes of the Fathers of olde: But fayth then is confirmed and made ſtronger, vvhen the euent anſwereth to the prediction: And therefore wee vvho nowe liue, haue greater matter of fayth and conſolation, than they had who liued vnder the Lawe: they had but the predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Chriſt, but we now vnder the Goſpel, haue not only the predictions, but alſo the accompliſhment of all that was ſpokon &amp; fore-told by the Prophets: And therefore Chriſt comparing vs to the people of old, (<hi>Luke,</hi> 10.23.) ſayeth, Bleſſed are the eyes that ſee theſe things which ye ſee: I ſay to you, Many Kinges and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets deſired to ſee theſe things that ye ſee, and yet ſaw them not. And againe, Abraham longed to ſee my dayes, <hi>John,</hi> 8.16. In very deede, vvee haue a great bleſsing, vvho are come into the worlde ſince Chriſt came: But here is the fault, We cannot apprehend that joye and happineſſe. The Apoſtle conſidering this, hee ſayeth, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce continually, 1. <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 5.16. Wee neuer conſider the gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e vvhich we haue vnder the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>When he hath ſet downe this ende, the Lord appearingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth this conference with his Diſciples: <hi>Heereafter I will not ſpeake may thinges to you</hi>: And hee giueth the reaſon: for why? <hi>The Prince of this worlde commeth</hi>: My ſpeach is cut off, becauſe the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill is come againſt mee, vvith all his force: and hee is come like a Burrio, to execute that which the Father ordained to be done from all eternity. Marke: as the houre drewe neare, vvhen the Lord ſhould haue laide downe his life for the world; ſo the Deuils drew neare, vvho were appointed to execute that turne: and they began to aſſault him very buſily: and aſſault him not only by the wicked inſtrumentes, as Iudas, Pilate, and the Iewes, but the Deuill, and all the whole force of Hell, in their owne perſons, ruſhed out vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt, and eſpecially when the Lord Ieſus hung vpon the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:16631:43"/>
Croſſe: at that time chiefelie hee had his combate with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils Bee not deceiued, Hee ſuffered not onelie that paine in bodie, and wrath of his Father; but at that inſtant hee had a battell with all the Deuils in Hell, for they thought to haue wracked him then, and to haue triumphed ouer him, and by his wracke, to haue wracked all men, and to haue diſgraced the glory of God: for in Ieſus Chriſt, is all the glory of God, and all ſaluation of man. Paul in the ſecond to the Coloſſ. Verſ. 15. ſayeth, That Chriſt vpon the Croſſe triumphed ouer the powers of Hell, and made an open ſhewe of them: and this importeth, that they ruſhed on him on the Croſſe, that they might ouer-come him. Chriſt fighteth with all the powers of Hell on the Croſſe, and taketh all the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer from them, and openlie in the ſight of the worlde hee lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them captiue, after the manner of a victorious Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. Yet ere wee leaue this, we ſee another thing: As the houre drewe neare, as the Deuils drewe neare, with the houre of Ieſus Chriſt, What doeth hee? Goeth hee to eſchewe them? Goeth hee out of Hieruſalem, as hee did of before? Goeth hee to hide himſelfe? No, no: But as the houre drewe neare, and as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils drewe neare, ſo the Lord Ieſus meeteth death, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, and draweth neare to them, and willinglie putteth himſelfe into their hands, knowing it was the will of his Father, Hee is as readie to die, &amp; offer himſelfe, and put himſelfe into their hands, as they were bent to ſeeke him. This is our leſſon: When the Lord giueth vs tokens, that Death is at hand, as Age, ſickneſſe or afflictions: for they are ſummondes to warne vs: What ſhoulde wee doe? Should wee abhorre from it? No, goe forwarde, and bee readie to imbrace death: goe to him, and meete him, and take a gripe of him: as hee imbra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:16631:44"/>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>: But ſo it is, the Lord Ieſus is God, and the Deuill is his inferior; therefore hee hath no power ouer me. He aſſaileth him, becauſe he had our burden vpon him. Nowe marke one thing: The holy Spirit in the Scripture, New and Old, vvhere he ſpeaketh of the ſuffering of Chriſt, he is very carefull to note theſe circumſtances, that Chriſt ſuffered no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that which God decreed. In the Acts, 24. Chap. What could they doe to him, but that which thy counſell had decreed? Another: vvhen it commeth to the execution of the decree, the Spirit maketh God to bee the Agent, vvho decreed it. Looke the eight Chapter to the Romanes, Hee ſpared not his owne Sonne, but hee gaue him to the death. What was the Deuill, but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument in the hande of God? The holy Spirit telleth vs this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that the Lord Ieſus ſuffered willingly: as willing was the Lord Ieſus to ſuffer, as was the Father to giue him. Iohn, 10. verſ. 18. No man taketh my life from mee: I haue power to lay downe my life, and to take vp my life againe. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. Hee offered himſelfe. Wherefore is it that the ſuffering of Chriſt is ſet downe with theſe particular circumſtances? The firſt reaſon is, The Spirit of God will let vs ſee, that in the ſuffering of Chriſt there is no diſgracing of the glory of God: indeed if he had ſuffered againſt Gods will, and his decree, then God had beene diſgraced: but when wee knowe it was not againſt Gods will, there is no diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the glory of God. Another is, If the Croſſe of Chriſt had bene againſt Chriſts owne will, it had bene a great diſcomfort to men and women, and had beene a great offence to the worlde. Laſt, the willingneſſe of the Sonne to ſuffer, letteth vs ſee that the ſuffering of Ieſus Chriſt, was obedience to the Father. When a man doeth a thing willingly, becauſe it is the will of God, offereth vp his life willingly, and dieth willingly, there is obedience: But let him die ten thouſand deaths, if he doe it not willingly, it is none obedience: I ſuppone that the Son of God had not ſuffered wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, wee would haue had no ſaluation: the obedience ſtandeth not only in ſuffering, but in that he died ſo gladly, ſuffered ſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, with ſuch a loue, to powre out his life for the world: as yee may reade in the 53. Chap. of Eſay, Hee was like a Lambe before the Shearers. So when wee looke to the death of Chriſt, let vs not looke to his death ſo much, as to his patience &amp; willingneſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:16631:44"/>In the laſt verſe the Lord ſetteth downe the ende of his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, wherefore he putteth himſelfe into the handes of the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: I doe this, <hi>that the worlde may know, that I loue the Father.</hi> This is the end: Wee ſee firſt in this end, the ground of the obedience and ſuffering of Ieſus Chriſt. What needed him to be ſo obedient, and to deject himſelfe ſo farre? Yee may take it vp in one worde: All this obedience proceeded of an vnſpeakeable loue he bare to the Father: It is true, the loue of the ſaluation of man moued the Lord to this obedience alſo, no doubt: and this vnſpeakeable loue mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him to giue his life for them. But marke yet, this place letteth vs ſee, the chiefe ground of his obedience was not the loue of the world, but the loue of the Father. Paul, 2. <hi>Philipp.</hi> 5.6.7.8. ſpeaking of the obedience of Ieſus Chriſt, letteth vs ſee, and poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth out that humiliation of Chriſt as proceeding of that loue he bare to the Father: Let that affection, ſayth he, be in you, that was in Chriſt Ieſus; who being in the forme of God, thought it no robbery to bee equall with God: but hee manited himſelfe, and made himſelfe of no reputation, in taking vpon him the ſhape of a ſeruant, and in that ſhape hee became obedient to the Father to the death of the Croſſe. That obedience then flowed from the loue he bare to the Father. Yee would thinke it a great matter to two kinges, the one of them as great as the other, if one woulde ſerue the other in a worldly ſeruice, yee woulde thinke it a great loue the one bare to the other: The Lord Ieſus being equall with the Father in glory, humbled himſelfe to the Father. What follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed on this obedience? As hee dejecteth himſelfe thorow loue to obey the Father, ſo the Father loueth him vnſpeakeably. Paul (2. <hi>Philipp.</hi> verſ. 9.10.11.) letteth vs ſee the effect of this loue: hee exalteth him to a wonderfull ſublimitie, and hee giueth him a Name aboue all the names of the worlde, That at the Name of IESVS, all thinges in Heauen, and in Earth, and vnder the Earth, ſhould bow their knee: or elſe, if they will not bow, they ſhould bee broken.</p>
            <p>Now, Brethren, to draw this example to our ſelues, wee haue this leſſon to learne: What is the ground of true humilitie? (I ſpeake not of fained humilitie, but of true lowlineſſe, which is the beſt vertue in a Chriſtian man: Learne of mee, ſayeth Chriſt, that I am humble and lowly in heart, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.29.) not only of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Superiors: for Chriſt biddeth thee bee obedient and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiceable, not onely to Superiors and equals, but to inferiors, and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:16631:45"/>
each one to another. What is the ground of this humilitie? Euen the loue of the heart: and a man haue true loue in the heart, hee will not care how lowlie he be in the world. So when ye ſee a ſober Chriſtian, point him out, and ſay, There is a louing hearted Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. Would yee knowe what followeth on humilitie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? Obedience. What followeth vpon obedience? They who in loue humble themſelues, to exalt others, and obey them, ſhall find that God will meet them with loue, and exalt them. Wherein ſtandeth the band of loue? When euery one preferreth another to himſelfe. Heerein ſtandeth humilitie: humilitie beginneth with loue, and endeth with loue. By the contrarie: What is the ground of pride? A fooliſh ſelfe-loue, when a man taketh pleaſure in his owne corruptions, and hath a conceit of himſelfe, and an hatred and diſdaining of others. Wherewith is it met? With a mutuall hatred and diſdaine: That man who is proude, ſtinketh both in Gods noſe and mans: and as humility intertaineth peace amongſt men, ſo pride breaketh the amitie and loue, and rents the body of Chriſt: ſo that pride is the moſt vnſeemly thing in any man, and it is a note of them who perteine not to Chriſt. Striue euer to be like Chriſt, in being humble: and haue loue in thine heart. But what is the chiefe ende of the ſuffring of Chriſt Ieſus, and of his humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? The Lord ſets it down in theſe words, <hi>That the world may know that the Sonne loueth the Father.</hi> Indeed this is one end, yea, the chiefeſt which we ſhould all conſider. Another is, that we may know, that Ieſus Chriſt hath loued vs. Looke in, thorowe the body of Chriſt into the heart: looke not to the nailes, and to the woundes of his ſide, but to that heart of his: and chiefely to that infinit loue that the Sonne hath borne to the Father. Thou mayſt ſay, What aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage is it to mee to know that obedience of the Sonne to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that loue? When thou ſeeſt that Sonne of God equal with the Father, how hee humbled himſelf ſo lowly, that no creature in Heauen, or in earth, Angel or man, euer humbled himſelfe ſo as the Sonne; It ſerueth thee to this ende, to learne thee who is a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and who is but a ſeruant, to humble thy ſelfe before God, and to glorifie thy God: And indeede, albeit there be many thinges to moue vs to humilitie, yet and a man get not the ſight of that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation of Ieſus Chriſt, he ſhall neuer be truely humbled. Paul, in his ſecond Chap. to the Philipp. to ſtirre vs vp to humilitie, he bringeth in the example of the humilitie of the Sonne to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Ye will aske, Haue we any profit of this, that we be humbled
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:16631:45"/>
to the Father? Haſt thou no profit in glorifying God? Neuer one ſerued ſuch a Maſter, and neuer one got ſuch a glory, as they ſhall get, who glorifie God. Was Chriſt exalted highly? Thou ſhalt bee alſo exalted. I aske then, Wherein ſtandeth thy miſery? and wherein ſtandeth thine happineſſe? There is the only joy that the creature hath: when it hath humbled it ſelfe to the Father, it obeyeth him, it glorifieth the great God the Creator: And herein ſtandeth the happineſſe of man, euen to haue his heart looſed to glorifie the Lord: The godly finde this in experience. And by the contrary, when the faythfull ſoule is locked vp, and hath no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to glorifie God for his graces, albeit it had neuer ſo great aboundance of all things in the world, yet it counteth the ſelfe to be in great miſery. Paul (<hi>Rom.</hi> 7.) feeling this rebellion in him tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the remains of ſinne, crieth out, Miſerable man that I am, who ſhall deliuer me fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this body of death? Indeed if thou make rebellion to God, if thou hadſt all the pleaſures in the world, thou art miſerable. Felicity is, when the heart is looſed to ſerue God: for the end of gifts, ſpirituall &amp; temporall, is to glorifie him: and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery is, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rſt in this Chapter hee exhorteth his Diſciples to that vnion with him: Secondly, to that brotherly loue: laſt, hee returneth to that conſolation begun in this Chapter, comforting them againſt the hatred and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the worlde. Before hee come to the exhortation to that vnion with him, hee premitteth in the beginning of the Chapter a generall doctrine, wherein he denounceth an heauy judgement, The cutting away of ſuch members who bring foorth no fruite: and hee promiſeth an increaſe of grace to them who would bring foorth fruit: &amp; ſo he prepareth them to that vnion wherevnto he exhorteth them. He ſetteth down theſe grounds, as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon both to the denuntiation, and to the promiſes: Firſt, that he himſelfe is the true Vine tree: Secondly, that the Father is an Husbandman. On this ground hee deduceth a judgement to thoſe who will not bring foorth fruite: and mercy to them who will bring foorth fruit. The Lord, when he was in the worlde, was wont to ſtand vp in the middeſt of the people, and with an high voyce to point out the fulneſſe of grace that was in himſelfe, and that ſerued to life: and that by ſimilitudes and compariſons, taken from thinges earthly, ſeruing to the comfort of this life. Sometimes hee ſayth, <hi>I am that Bread of Life,</hi> as in the ſixt Chap. of this Goſpel, Verſ. 48. Sometimes hee ſayeth, <hi>I am the Light of the worlde,</hi> as in the eight Chap. verſ. 12. Sometimes he ſayth, <hi>J am the Way, the Trueth, and the Life,</hi> as in the 14. chap. verſ. 6. The Lord then is the Bread, and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:16631:46"/>
the true Bread, that feedeth the ſoule to life euerlaſting: the Lord is the only Light, that illuminateth the dead ſoule: the Lord is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that Way, that leadeth to Life: the Lord is that Vine tree, which furniſheth all ſap, juyce, and ſuſtentation, to all them who as bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are ingraffed in him: and take him away, all men are drie, like a ſticke: and no man without him can bring foorth fruit, no more than a withered ſticke can bud out in flowres. In compariſon of other thinges, hee is ſayde to bee the true Bread, the true Light, the true Vine, &amp;c. becauſe he ſubſtantially and eſſentially is ſo: the creatures are onely ſo accidentally, and by way of participation. The ſecond ground: My Father is an Husbandman. The compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon betwixt the Father of our Lord Ieſus, and the husbandman, ſtandeth not in all points: the husbandman giueth not the ſap and nouriſhment, or life to the Vine tree: the Vine tree of the own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath the ſap within it: only the husbandman intertaineth the ſap and life which is in the tree: But this Husbandman, the Father, communicateth with his Son, the whole ſap of life, which is him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. <hi>As the Father hath life in himſelfe, ſo hath he giuen to the Sonne to haue life in himſelfe. Ioh.</hi> 5.26. The Father in that eternal generation com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth his life with his Son: but the compariſon ſtandeth in this, As the husbandman, in time of yeere, cutteth downe the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull vine tree, and cheriſheth that which is fruitful; ſo the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Lord Ieſus, dreſſeth his vine trees, cutteth away rotten members, &amp; purgeth the fruitfull, that they may be more fruitfull. Take vp this ground ſhortly: The Father of our Lord Ieſus is ſuch an husbandman, as neuer one was: firſt he giueth ſap to his Son, &amp; then thorow him all ſap co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to all men &amp; women: all ſap flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth out of the Lord Ieſus, which is the Vine tree, to all his owne children. Now we come to the denuntiation, <hi>Euery branch that brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth not foorth fruit in me, the Father will cut away</hi>: The promiſe is, <hi>Euerie one who is ingraffed in me, &amp; beareth fruit, the Father will purge them, ſo that they may be able to bring foorth more fruit.</hi> Wee haue to marke what are theſe branches, &amp; what is this fruit. By theſe bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ches I vnderſand the whole viſible Kirkes in the world, whether they bee ingraffed truly or not in the Lord Ieſus, whether they be corn or chaff, ſheep or goats, true Chriſtians or hypocrits, they are called branches. By the fruit is vnderſtood good works: It is as needful to them, who are ingraffed in the Lord Ieſus, to bring foorth good works, as to the vine tree to bring forth wine berries, being filled with ſap. But for the farder clearing of this mater, we ſhal ſpeak ſomthing of this
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:16631:47"/>
compariſon: as the husbandman, who hath a vineyard, wil haue all his care ſet vpon the vineyard, becauſe it is both his pleaſure, &amp; his profit: ſo the whole care of the Father is vpon Ieſus Chriſt his Son, for he is his vine tree: the whole joy &amp; glory of the Father is in the Son: all the care the Father hath, is in the Son, in him he acquiſces, &amp; is well pleaſed. Next, if there be a vine tree in the vineyard that the husbandman loueth wel, he wil haue al the branches numbred of that tree: he wil not let them go out of his eye. So there is not in all this world a ſeruant of the Lord Ieſus, but the Father hath them all numbred: they are all in his eyes. Ye remember in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of the Marriage banquet (<hi>Mat.</hi> 22.11.) it is ſaid, when they were all come in, the King commeth in alſo, to view the banqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t: what meaneth this, but the care of the Father, that he hath of his branches, who are ingraffed in Chriſt? The King is the Father of Heauen: he who is married, is the Son: &amp; they who are called, are the branches. The eye of the Father is vpon all the members, good &amp; bad: yea, that hypocrit who wanted the wedding garment, was ſoone ſeene by him. Let him be an hypocrit who wil, king or beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, the Lord wil point him out in his own time. Now laſt, the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman in the own time will dreſſe the vine tree: he taketh away the vnfruitfull, and purgeth the fruitful: Euen ſo the Father of our Lord Ieſus, goeth to his vine tree, &amp; vieweth the branches, &amp; in his own time wil come with his ſnedding knife, &amp; will cut off the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrit: &amp; he will purge the fruitfull, &amp; the next yeere it will bring forth more fruit. The Father cutteth off hypocrits: &amp; this we haue ſeene: And then againe in the faithfull he augments regeneration and grace. Mark this Text well, &amp; ye ſhall ſee the pleaſandeſt vine tree that euer was in the worlde, with the roote, the body of the tree, the branches, &amp; the fruits budding forth in euery branch: the root of this vine tree is the Father, who is the Fountain of all life: the body of the vine tree is the Son, the bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ches are men &amp; women ingraffed by faith in the body: the fruit of the tree is good works: the ſap of life is in the Father, he is the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of al grace, &amp; ſendes this his ſap to the body of the tree, the Son: &amp; the Son hath all the grace that is in the root: &amp; then the body of the tree ſendes ſap to the branches: &amp; then the bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ches being filled with ſap, bring forth fruit as neceſſarily, as a vine tree can bring foorth fruite. So if yee would take vp the nature of theſe works, ye ſhal vnderſtand, that good works ſpring not from fleſh and blood, they come not from the power of men &amp; women, &amp; from nature and free-wil. So fooliſh
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:16631:47"/>
Papiſts will ſay, that men will doe good workes of nature, and of free-will: No, no, theſe works proceede not of nature: no, there is not a good worke, but it floweth from that life which is in the Father, and is communicated to the Sonne: there is not ſo much as a charitable, or a good thought, but it floweth from the life of God. So all the good we doe, is as fruits flowing from that roote. And thou were not imped in Chriſt, and ſo as a wild Oliue, parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the ſappe of that true Oliue, it would paſſe thy power to thinke a good thought, and thou wouldſt do no more good, than a withered ſtocke can. Now marke this: When as it pleaſeth the Lord to tranſport vs from that rotten roote of Adam, and to ſet vs in Ieſus Chriſt, the ſeconde Adam, then whereas before wee brought foorth but ſtinking fruit and dead workes, as the Apoſtle calleth them: (all is but filth and ſtinke, without the life of God in Chriſt, let be all theſe workes which are forbidden in the Law: and it were a good worke, hee polluteth it, becauſe hee medleth with it, and there be nothing but nature) being once ingraffed in Ieſus Chriſt, then the creature beginneth to drawe out ſo fruitfull ſappe, and ſo delicate, that all the ſappe of the Vine tree is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in compariſon thereof: And when wee haue gotten of that ſappe, then the fruit commeth out, and floweth with a ſweet ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſauour: fra once the heart begin to ſucke of that life, the verie ſmelling of the life of Ieſus Chriſt, wil appeare in the works, &amp; in the words. It is true indeed, &amp; we may find it al, there is euer in all our fruites, in all our deeds, and wordes that proceede out of our mouth, ſome bitterneſſe &amp; ſourneſſe in the beſt of vs all: the cauſe is, howbeit we be ingraffed in Chriſt, yet that old life abideth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till vs all: &amp; ſo the fruit we bring out as it hath a ſauour of Chriſt, ſo it ſtinketh of the old man: the beſt worke that wee bring out, is partly ſweete, and partly ſoure, and the worde ſauoureth of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: but and we be highly diſpleaſed for the bitterneſſe, then wee haue this comfort, We may bee aſſured, the Father is purging vs: and this hope, That when we ſhall bee with Chriſt, our fruits ſhall all ſauour of that life of God in Chriſt: and this ſhould augment our joye.</p>
            <p>Next, wee ſee wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> neede wee haue euen to bee purged, and to make a perpetuall progreſſe in regeneration: if the Father ſhould leaue off to cleanſe the liuely branches that are in the Lord Ieſus, as ſoone the liuelieſt ſhould turne in rottenneſſe, and then the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall corruption ſhould ouer-goe vs, except hee were euer ſned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:16631:48"/>
vs: and of liuely members, wee ſhould become dead: All our ſtanding and perſeuerance is of him. Another thing: as vnpoſsible as it is that the Father of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſhould leaue off to purge the members of Chriſt; euen as vnpoſsible is it, that that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber can fal away: if it were poſsible that the Father ſhould leaue off his office, then it might be poſsible that men ſhould fall away. No, the Father can neuer leaue off his office: &amp; they who are once ingraffed in Ieſus Chriſt, ſhall neuer be cut off. It is a falſe doctrine of the Papiſts, who ſay, that a man once ſanctified, may become vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified: it is an horrible blaſphemie, and a lie againſt the holie Ghoſt. The laſt thing I marke: Looke how needfull is it that the Father play the part of an husbandman in purging; as needfull it is that euery branch grow in holineſſe &amp; ſanctification: the Father cannot purge the branches in vain; but as he purgeth the branches from their own nature, ſo the branches muſt bring out berries: So if they who profeſſe themſelues to be Chriſtians, make no grouth, &amp; neuer mend in holineſſe, it is a toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the Father of our Lord Ieſus purgeth them not: and then they are not branches. So take heed. Men will hunt greedily after honor, riches, and pleaſure: but this is the thing thou ſhouldeſt chiefely ſtriue to, That thou make much grouth in Ieſus, &amp; that thou find thy ſoule in better diſpoſition this yere, than it was the laſt: that thou may be a true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Ieſus Chriſt. This for the denunciation of the ſentence againſt the branches that bring foorth no fruit, and the promiſe to them that bring foorth fruit.</p>
            <p>Theſe words might haue moued his Diſciples to be feared, and to haue heauy hearts: therfore the Lord, who ſaw all their cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, meeteth them, to comfort them, (Howbeit he ſpeake not to vs, he comforteth vs by his holy Spirit) and he letteth them know that that denunciation perteined not to them, becauſe they were liuely members: <hi>they were cleane through the worde which hee had ſpoken to them.</hi> Our leſſon is, When thou heareſt a denunciation of judgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or promiſe of mercy, make euer application to thy ſelfe, and ſay, Lord, perteineth this judgement to me? and, O Lord, perteineth this mercy to mee? Without this application, there is no generall doctrine can do good, or edifie thee. So when we heare of this, that ſome are liuing branches, &amp; ſome dead, we ſhold enter in triall with our ſelues whether we are to abide with Chriſt, or to be cut off, and caſten into the fire. It is true, we haue not Chriſt to ſpeak with vs, and to reſolue vs of ſuch doubts: yet the Lord hath neuer left anie
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:16631:48"/>
faithful man or woman ſo deſtitute, but he gets a certification &amp; aſſurance, that he is a liuely member. The Lord, if he be in any man or woman, he ſhall make that perſon know, that he liueth in them. The moſt ſenſible thing in the worlde, is the life of Chriſt: as ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>l the creature feele the life of Chriſt in their harts, as they wil feel this natural life. Beſides this, if the ſap of Chriſt be in a ma, the fruit wil burſt out: &amp; if thou wouldſt know a man, look to his life &amp; good works: let his life teſtify whether he be a liuely me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber or not: if their life teſtify otherways, I teſtify to thee, in the Name of God, they are no liuely me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers. Certainly Chriſt ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not dwel wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thin one, but he muſt vtter himſelf in the hand &amp; tong. Now here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after he ſubjoynes the reaſon wherfore they are clean, &amp; how they are made cleane, <hi>By the words,</hi> saith he, <hi>that J haue ſpoken,</hi> ye are made cleane: wherefore ſpake I ſo much to you, but to make liuelie members of you, who were drie branches? The way to make a man a liuely branch, is the worde of Ieſus: it cleanſeth the ſoule which is foule: My word is Spirit and Life, <hi>John, 6. verſ. 63.</hi> It is the force of the Spirit to purge the ſoule. The worde, ſayeth Peter, is that immortall ſeede of regeneration, 1. <hi>Epiſt. Chap. 1. verſ. 23.</hi> Our ſeede is mortall, and ſo if wee haue not another ſeede of God, wee are but dead. It is no maruell, that the word of God purgeth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is Life and Spirit: Looke but to that experience that god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie men haue in hearing the worde of Ieſus Chriſt and that joye that riſeth in the heart. What meaneth this? Will the vvordes of anie man worke this joye in the heart? No: but when men heare theſe promiſes of life, and of grace, and conſolation, O what conſolation, what peace, what reſt, what joye will the ſinner get! And this teſtifieth, that the worde is powerfull to worke in the ſoule that life of God. The houre ſhall come, ſayeth the Lord, that the dead ſhall heare the voyce of the Sonne of God, and they that ſhall heare, ſhall liue, <hi>John, 5. verſ. 25. 1 Pet. 1. verſ. 22.</hi> Our ſoules are purged by the hearing of the worde. If this bee the meane the Lord hath ordained to get life, let vs take pleaſure to heare the worde: And I ſaye, that man that hath not a pleaſure in ſome m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As thou therefore wouldeſt liue, and as thou wouldeſt bee sanctified in this life, &amp; glorified with the Lord in the Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, take pleaſure to heare this word: &amp; if thou would taſte any ſweetnes of

            <p>Now in the next words, after he hath laide down the grounds, he commeth to the firſt exhortation: <hi>Abide in mee, and I in you.</hi> The meaning of the exhortation is this, Ye haue begun to be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with me in Spirit, and in fayth: as yee haue begun, ſo continue in that vnion to the ende. He ſayth not, Abide ſtill with me, and I with you: but abide <hi>in mee.</hi> Theſe wordes haue a greater ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than the other: they ſignifie a ſtraiter vnion with Chriſt: for Brethren, yee muſt marke, the members of Ieſus Chriſt, not onelie abide with him here, and dwell with him: but euery one of them abideth in him, and dwelleth in him: as yee ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e the branches of the tree, they are not ſayde ſo much to abide with the tree, as to abide in the tree: ſo are we in him. And on the other part, the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus is not ſaid only to abide with his Kirke on the earth: but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit hee bee in the Heauens, to dwell in his Kirke, and in euery member, who belieueth in him: yea, in all their hearts: euen as yee ſee the tree abideth in her branches, ſo the Lord Ieſus, the Vine tree, abideth in his branches.</p>
            <p>This place requireth that wee ſpeake ſomewhat of this vnion the members haue with Chriſt, and hee with them: This conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction betwixt Chriſt and his members, who are faythfull, ye muſt not imaginate to be a bodily and naturall conjunction, as ye ſee is betwixt creatures, as the head with the body, it is not ſo groſſe a conjunction: there is no conjunction bodily, ſo neare, &amp; ſo ſtrait, as that conjunction of Ieſus Chriſt, nowe in the Heauens with his members: the heade is not ſo ſurely joyned with the body by nearnes, as the Lord Ieſus, our Head, is joyned with euery member, who belieueth in him vpon this earth: The body and the head may bee ſeuered, but the members of Ieſus Chriſt, once truely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed in him by his Spirit, and by fayth, ſhall neuer be cut off: all the powers of Heauen and Hell, ſhall not ſeparate them. What ſhall ſeparate vs from the loue of Ieſus Chriſt? ſhall hunger and ſworde, &amp;c. yea, in theſe wee are more than victorious, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.35.37. So yee ſee this conjunction, is not to bee imagined to bee a groſſe conjunction, as the Papiſtes imagine: (but I leaue them:) But this conjunction is ſpirituall, and myſticall: I call that a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall vnion and conjunction that we haue with him, becauſe it is wrought after an heauenly and ſpirituall manner, and is made not with bodily bandes, as ligamentes and ſinewes, but with ſpirituall
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:16631:49"/>
and heauenly bandes: the one of them is called the Spirit of Ieſus Chriſt, the other is called Fayth. To make that coniunction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt vs and him, hee ſendeth out of the Heauens his holy Spirit, into our hearts: and wee getting that Spirit, ſende vp to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens againe to him, our fayth. Then yee ſee two bands, to make this conjunction: this conjunction muſt be mutuall; ſo that as hee ſendeth downe his Spirite to vs, ſo wee muſt ſende vp our fayth to him. The order of the working of theſe two bandes would bee conſidered: Wee neuer begin firſt: no man beginneth firſt to gripe Chriſt, but he muſt gripe vs firſt: all thinges begin at him, and his affection is to vs firſt: ere we loue him, hee loueth vs: and becauſe he imbraceth vs ſo friendly with his loue, therefore wee loue him: and the ſenſe of the loue of God in Ieſus Chriſt were not in vs firſt wrought, wee would neuer loue him: Euen ſo is it in that conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, &amp; if he neuer conjoyned himſelfe with vs firſt, we would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer gripe him. Paul, to the Philippians, Chap. 3. Verſ 12. he ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to get a gripe of him, by whom he was first griped: And this ſhould bee our ſtrife, To ſtriue euer to gripe Chriſt and if this bee not thy ſtrife, miſerable ſhall bee thine ende: as it is in that conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſo it is in the perſeuerance: No man can perſeuer in that loue, and in that fayth, except it pleaſe the Lord to abide with vs by his Spirit. In one worde: all grace beginneth at Chriſt: and if we haue any grace, all floweth from him.</p>
            <p>Our Leſſon is, When we heare the Lord exhorting vs after this manner, Abide in mee, and I in you; anſwere, Abide in mee, Lord, and I ſhall abide in thee: Lord, except thou abide in me, I will fall. and ſuch like, when the Lord ſayeth, Belieue in me: ſay, Lord, take a gripe of mee by thy Spirit, firſt. So when it is said, Loue mee; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, Lord, loue thou mee firſt; for the loue I haue to thee floweth from the loue thou haſt to me.</p>
            <p>Now wee come to the reaſons the Lord vſeth to moue his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, to abide in that vnion with him: The firſt argument hee vſeth, is from good works, and a sanctified life: and this is the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, Except yee abide in that vnion with me, there cannot bee ſuch a thing that any of you can bring foorth fruit: Therefore as thou wouldeſt liue an holy life, abide in me, and ſticke faſt by me. He declareth this b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a compariſon, Except the branch abide in the Vine tree, it can bring foorth no fruit: So except yee be ingraffed in me, and abide in me, the true Vine tree, no more can yee produce good works. Marke it, this reaſon craueth a conſideration of an
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:16631:50"/>
higher ground: the ground is this, There is a neceſsitie laide vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on euerie man and woman in the worlde, to liue an holie life, as euer they would ſee the face of God. Nowe this neceſsitie being laide, come to the reaſon: But ſo it is, No man can liue an holie life, except he abide in Chriſt: Therfore as euer any man wold taſte of life, let him ſtriue to bee in Chriſt, and neuer let Chriſt depart from him not a foot breade. Ye ſee in this reaſon, the way to ſtrait any man to belieue in Ieſus Chriſt: firſt thou who wouldeſt belieue in Chriſt, haſt a neceſsity laid on thee, that thou leade an holy life, thou muſt be changed, thou muſt haue a new life: otherwayes, take thee thy doome, thou ſhalt neuer ſee the face of God: &amp; I pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in the Name of the great God, that if thou liue not an holy life in ſome meaſure, thou ſhalt neuer ſee the face of God. The Lord ſaith to Nicodemus, <hi>Ioh. 3.</hi> Except a man be borne againe, he cannot ſee the Kingdome of God. The next ground: Without Chriſt Ieſus there is no power to doe good: without him thou canſt not think a good thought: without him thou art but a drie ſticke, without anie ſappe. Then I aske, how can the Papiſtes, who affirme, that we haue free-will naturallie to doe good: how can they, I ſay, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade a man to belieue in Chriſt? They deceiue the worlde. Can this bee a good doctrine? No, I pronounce, in the Name of the great God of Heauen, Except a man denude himſelfe of nature, except hee ſtand vp naked, and ſay, Lord, there is no power in me to anie good whatſoeuer, hee ſhall neuer get Chriſt: Except wee bee perſwaded, that without Chriſt we can doe nothing, and that wee are but drie ſtickes, the ſoule ſhall neuer cleaue till him: But when the ſoule ſhall heare and knowe this, then it ſhall runne with griedineſſe to gripe him. This for the firſt argument.</p>
            <p>The next argument, taken from good workes, is in theſe words in the next verſe, <hi>I am the Vine tree, and yee are the branches</hi>: And if ye abide in mee, yee will bring out much fruite. They might aske, Is it not poſsible to bring foorth fruite without thee? Hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth, <hi>Without mee yee can doe nothing.</hi> The argument<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If ye abide in mee, yee ſhall bring out much fruite: Not onelie fruit, but much fruite. The longer a man bee in Chriſt, the holier hee is. Take vp another ground of fayth, and an alluring argument, to drawe the heart to Ieſus Chriſt: this is the ground, That if a man would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue in him, they ſhould not onelie be holie, and leade an holie life, but growe in holineſſe. This ground differeth from the other: the former ſtraiteth the ſoule: as for this, it is not a binding argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:16631:50"/>
but a ſecret alluring argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, If thou ſhalt belieue in Chriſt, thou ſhalt abound in holineſſe. Whom moueth this? Only thoſe who ſee themſelues withered, and faine would haue that ſappe of life in Ieſus Chriſt. Tell the ſoule, who ſeeth the owne miſery, that and if it bee in Chriſt, it ſhall liue, and will get the ſappe of life, it will rejoyce: it will not moue them who delite in a filthie and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted life. Marke our nature, for the Lord knoweth it well, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to it he ſetteth down arguments in order: there is not one, but ere they come to Chriſt, they muſt be ſtraited, and neceſsitie laid vpon their backe; otherwayes we wil neuer ſeek to Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are ſtubborn by nature. That neceſsitie that was laid vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Nicodemus, muſt be told to vs all: there is neuer one of vs, but wee are ſtraited with the ſame ſtraite: and when wee are ſtraited this way, except wee bee obſtinate, wee will run to Chriſt. Next, it is not enough to boaſt a man: if there bee but boaſting onelie, there will bee no beliefe. The Lord knewe this well, and therefore hee ſubjoyneth to this a faire alluring argument. Wee muſt not begin with faire words, but we muſt ſtrait men, as they would liue to belieue in Chriſt: and then come on with ſweete promiſes: If the Lord moue vs not with faire promiſes, wee will bee obſtinate for euer. Surelie when a man ſeeth hee muſt doe ſuch a thing, and if hee doe it, hee will get ſuch a rewarde, that hee ſhall bee filled with ſappe, to bring foorth an holie life; well, will hee ſay, I ſee not onlie a neceſitie to belieue; but I ſee alſo, that if I doe it, I ſhall b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> made a fruitfull branch, whereas I was but a rotten ſticke, to be ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſten into the fire: and then he wil ſay to his ſoule, My ſoule, belieue in Chriſt, and ſticke vpon him, and thou ſhalt ſee a bleſſed end.</p>
            <p>Now another thing I gather: I ſee heere hee counteth much of good works, which he calleth fruits: &amp; he moueth them to belieue from this argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of good works. The end of faith, is a ſanctified life: and the end of that vnion with Chriſt, is good works: As the grace of God in Chriſt, is to make a regenerate man, and of a dead ſticke, to make a liuelie branch, and Chriſt came into the worlde, to repare that loſt image of God in man; the ende of election is to liue an holy life, <hi>Epheſ. Chap.</hi> 14. The ende of our vocation, of our juſtification, is to liue an holie life. To <hi>Titus, Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>verſ.</hi> 11.12. The grace of GOD, that bringeth ſaluation to all men, hath appeared, and teacheth vs, that vvee ſhoulde denie vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, and vvorldlie luſtes, and that vvee ſhoulde liue ſoberlie, righteouſlie, and godlily, in this preſent world. There is the whole
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:16631:51"/>
end of the grace of God, and of the Goſpel. So if a man haue not good works in ſome meaſure, he felt neuer the grace of Chriſt: the grace of God may ſhine in their faces, but not in their hearts.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the third argument, Except a man abide in me firſt, hee ſhall bee taken, <hi>and casten out,</hi> out of the Vineyarde: and next, as it were an vnfrui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>full branch, <hi>hee ſhall wither</hi>: then when it is withered, wherefore ſerueth it? Shall it be imped againe? No, but it <hi>ſhall bee casten into the fire.</hi> The fire of Hell is for them who will not come to Chriſt: A man goeth not to Hell at once, but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees: Hee who hath not adoe with Chriſt, hee is caſten out of the Kirke: that is, the ſocietie of the Lords Elect: that is, the true and inuiſible Kirke: howbeit for a ſeaſon they remaine in the viſible Kirke outwardly. Another degree, Being out of that ſocietie, hee withereth: and the laſt degree, he is caſten into the fire. If faire of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers will not moue a man to belieue in Chriſt Ieſus, then let the fire of Hell moue him. If thou wilt not belieue for faire promiſes, thou ſhalt ſee nothing but horrible judgement: and as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh to the Hebrewes, an vnquenchable fire. Tell a man nowe of beliefe in Chriſt, and of a ſanctified life, if they will belieue in him; it will not moue them, becauſe their delite is in murther, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, and adulterie. Then I tell thee, in the Name of the great God, thou who art not moued with theſe promiſes, the fire of Hell abideth thee: tell them this. Indeede it is true, the godlieſt man that liueth, hath euer need to be holden in Chriſt, by a flame of fire, we are ſo inclined to infidelitie: Knowing, (ſayth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of himſelfe, 2. <hi>Corinth.</hi> Chap. 5.) the terribleneſſe of the Lord, wee bring men to Chriſt: that is to ſay, Wee doe our duetie in our calling: And if hee had neede to bee holden in awe, much more had wee. The godlie, who haue a wakened conſcience, will finde this: as ſoone as they beginne to fall away, a flame of fire ſtriketh vpon them: for without Chriſt, there is nothing but fire, and the wrath of God ſeaſeth vpon the necke of the ſinner, and neuer lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him, till it bring him to deſtruction, and ſhoote him into the fire of Hell. Indeede men and women will bee out of Chriſt, (where there is one who belieueth, there are ten who belieue not: and it is a rare thing, truelie to belieue in Chriſt: Some there bee who denie Chriſt altogether, and ſome who are prophane hypocrites,) and yet the very infidels will finde reſt into this worlde: and who will bee ſo wanton as they? the greateſt infidels, the wantonneſt: But thinke not, howbeit they bee at reſt, that the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:16631:51"/>
wrath of God leaueth them: No, the wrath of God is moſt vpon them, when they are leaſt ſenſible of it, and perceiue it leaſt: for the wrath of God ſtriketh firſt the heart with a deafnes &amp; ſtupidity: and next followes the bittereſt &amp; dririeſt wakening that euer was. When the wicked cries peace, then that judgement comes on ſuddenly, as the pains on a woman trauelling in birth; and then driery &amp; ſorowfull ſhall that wakening be. Now to end: take vp here the way to Hell, and that, ſtep by ſtep: The firſt ſtep of all miſery, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, when a man is without Chriſt, and hath no part with him: So when one departeth from Chriſt, either to the one hand, or to the other, he is in a ſtep to Hell: The ſecond, fra he fall away from Chriſt, he is taken and flung ouer the Dike, as hauing no ſociety with the members of Chriſt. (I vnderſtand the number of his ſecret ones, if the Lord in the Heauen excommunicate him.) The third degree: Once caſten ouer the Dike, then they begin to wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and drie vp, and all grace goeth away. There is no grace, no mercy, no life, but to them who are in that bleſſed ſociety. Laſt, wherefore ſerue they, when they are rotten and drie? In that great day they are gathered together, and caſten into the fire of Hell. If any man would eſchew the laſt degree to Hell, (thinke not Hell a Bogill, for it is the ſoreſt burning in the world,) beware of the firſt degree: beware thou neuer ſwerue from Ieſus Chriſt, in any ſtep, but ſtriue to bind thy ſelfe in that vnion: When thou riſeſt in the morning, looke that hee be with thee, and thou with him: and ſo when thou lieſt downe at euen, looke euer thou bee in Chriſt: and if thou finde the heart ſweruing from him, and coldneſſe to grow in it, and thee to growe ſlacke, ſtriue euer to claime till him againe: and ſay, Lord, holde mine heart ſtill, that I decline not an ihtch from thee. Therefore, ſtriue euer to holde thee with Chriſt, and let not thy heart be blyth, except thou feele him againe in thy ſoule: and euer grow in holineſſe: be exerciſing thee this way, and thou ſhalt find in ſtead of feare, an infinit joy in Chriſt: And I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to you, if ye will belieue in Chriſt, the joyfulleſt end that euer was: Only belieue: and ſeeing it ſtandeth in no mans handes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue, ſay to the Lord in your hearts, Lord, worke thou that fayth in vs, for Chriſtes ſake: To whom with the Father, and the Spirit of Trueth, be all praiſe, honour, and glory, for euermore.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>EE heard the laſt day (Beloued in the Lord Ieſus) the firſt exhortation of the Chapter, was, That his Diſciples ſhould abide in that vnion with him, and he with them. Wee haue ſundry arguments of this purpoſe: The firſt, Except yee abide in mee, and in that vnion with me, yee can bring foorth no fruit, nor doe no good in this world: The ſecond is, That if yee abide in me, and I in you, ye ſhall bee full of good workes: The third, If a man abide not in mee, and I in him, hee ſhall bee caſten out of the Kirke: and once being caſten out, he ſhal wither, (for out of Chriſt there is no ſap of life) and then (being dried vp) hee ſhall bee ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered vp, like a drie ſticke, and caſten into the fire, to burne. So
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:16631:52"/>
the argument in this, Hee who cannot abide in Chriſt, he ſhall bee caſten into the fire of Hell: theſe arguments wee haue heard. Now in this Text, the Lord goeth forwarde in the argumentes, and firſt he giueth the fourth reaſon, wherefore they ſhould abide in him: then he paſſeth to other exhortations: Then the fourth and laſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is this, If ye abide in me and my words in you, then what euer ye aske, or ſeeke, ye ſhall haue it: Note the wordes, <hi>If yee abide in me, and my words in you</hi>: Before hee ſayd, If I abide in you: But all is alike: the Lord Ieſus abideth in the heart by the worde, and by fayth: ſo all is alike. But to come to the argument: What euer ſhall be your deſire, aske, and ye ſhall haue it: that is, If ye abide in me, all your petitions ſhall be granted. This argument is very allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, to tell a man what euer he deſireth, he ſhall haue. Before hee threatned, now he allureth. Ye ſee how the Lord tempereth his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments. But, Brethren, marke this: in reſpect of whom is this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument alluring? and whom moueth it? Not euery one: tell this to a man or woman who hath no ſenſe of their need, they will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere when they heare this, Wee haue no need to aske: tell this to a ſenſeleſſe ſinner, he will anſwere, he hath no need: what need hath the whole of the Phiſicion? but tell it to them who haue felt the weight of ſinne, and who haue felt their want, and knowe they are depriued of the glory of God, and ſtrangers from the life of God, as the Apoſtle ſayth, it ſhall be the joyfulleſt and ſweeteſt hearing that euer they heard: hee will be moued when he heareth this ſweete pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. Then when wee come to heare of the promiſes of grace in Chriſt, let vs prepare our ſelues this way, and ſay, I am voyde of al grace; therefore I will goe heare theſe faire promiſes of grace. Now the thing I marke here, Yee ſee how a ſinner getteth grace, and yee ſee by what degrees hee commeth to grace: The firſt and immediate meane to get grace and mercy, is to ſeeke: aske<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thou ſhalt haue: Heauen is little worth, and if it bee not worth the asking: beg Heauen, and thou ſhalt haue it: But who is it can doe this? Can all men doe it? Looke what muſt goe before asking: ere a man can aske grace, there muſt bee a thirſt and a deſire: looke that the heart bee hungry: Bleſſed are they who hunger and thirſt for righteouſneſſe, for they ſhall bee filled. The worlde is full of want, yet they haue not a ſenſe of want, or an heart to ſeeke. Howe riſeth the deſire in the heart? The deſire riſeth of a feeling in the heart, of a wonderfull inlacke and miſery, when a ſinner feeleth

hee is voyde of all grace, with this ſenſe, together with a ſadneſſe, &amp; godly ſorrow, for it hath euer ſadneſſe: (for who wanteth theſe earthly things, but they will bee ſad?) So the want of theſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly things hath a ſadneſſe with it. Paul ſayth, <hi>2. Corinth. 5. verſ.</hi> 4. Wee being burthened with ſinne, wee ſigh for ſadneſſe.

The ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner cannot haue it of himſelfe: for fleſh and blood, that is, the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature, will not feele this ſenſe: but it commeth of the Siprit of God.

So it is the Spirit who raiſeth vp theſe ſighes in the heart: and without the Spirit thou canſt not once giue a ſigh: Thou mayſt ſigh like a man, but not like a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall man. And how gette wee the Spirit? Belieue in Ieſus Chriſt: faith in Chriſt furniſheth vs the Spirit. <hi>Epheſ. 1. verſ. 13.</hi> After yee haue belieued, yee are ſealed vp with the holy Spirit of promiſe: for faith draweth out of Chriſt, into the heart, that Spirit: The grace of all grace, is to belieue in Ieſus Chriſt: and hauing him, thou ſhalt get the Spirit. I grant, the Spirite muſt goe before, and worke faith, but it is true alſo, that by faith wee gette a fuller meaſure of the Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So faith in the blood of Ieſus, is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of all grace: for all grace floweth from that blood, and the merit therof: and by the power of the Spirit, which accompanieth that blood, grace is applied till vs.</p>
            <p>Then yee ſee, that faith is the beginning of grace: the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit followeth faith: after the holy Spirite followeth a ſenſe of our miſery and want: vpon this ſenſe followeth an earneſt deſire: vpon the deſire followeth asking: by asking grace is obtained. So, looke thou ſtand in Chriſt, if thou wouldeſt haue grace. Out of this place yee may aske this queſtion, Will a man get all that hee ſeeketh of Chriſt? Hee anſwereth here, If yee abide in mee, and my wordes abide in you, aske conforme to this worde, and thou ſhalt obtaine it: if thou aske any Spirituall grace, thou ſhalt get it: Vndoubtedly, Heauen and Earth ſhall periſh ere thou want it. As for earthly thinges, he will not aye giue them according to thy deſire, but as hee thinketh meet, for his owne glory, and thy weale: And howe can they want, who getteth the Kingdome of Heauen? The Lord ſhall giue them ſo much as ſhall content them. The Lord ſhall giue thee ſo much as is neceſſary to a Pilgrime.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:16631:53"/>Nowe wee goe to the ſecon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e exhortation, which is to good workes: The firſt was to ſtande in that vnion with Chriſt: The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is, to bring out good works: <hi>Herein is my Father glorified, that ye beare much fruit; and in this ye ſhall be knowne to be my Diſciples.</hi> There are the two thinges: hee ſayeth not, Bring out fruite: but, Bring out much fruite, that is, doe much. A man ſhould ſtriue not to bring out fruite, but much fruite: and indeede, if wee continue in that vnion with Chriſt, wee ſhall grow in that regeneration, and ſo wee growe in good workes. The firſt argument hee uſeth, is taken from the glorie of the Father, <hi>In this is my Father glorified, that yee bring out much fruite.</hi> Surelie a moouing argument: at leaſt it ſhoulde mooue all ſoules to doe well, ſeeing God is glorified in my well doing, for I am ſet in the worlde to glorifie God. Take vp the grounde: Whome will this argument mooue? Not eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man: Tell to a man, who hath no zeale to God, nor no ſight of the glorie of God, Doe well, and glorifie God: hee will not care for it. But to tell a man, who loueth God, (alace, whome can hee loue, and if hee loue not God?) tell him, if hee will doe manie good workes, hee will glorifie God: hee will doe all that lieth in his power, yea, hee will ſuffer, that he may glorifie God: as Moyſes and Paul wiſhed to renounce Heauen to get their God glorified: And if Paul could gette God glorified, he cared neither for life nor death. Then when wee come to the hearing of the word, where ſuch exhortations are giuen vs, we ſhold bring hearts filled with zeale to the glory of God: and if thou bring ſuch an heart, when thou heareſt ſuch an argument, it will bee verie ſweete to thee. Yee ſee here in theſe wordes a faire effect following on good workes: when a man doeth well, the faireſt effect that euer was followeth: to wit, the glory of God thy Creator. The Papiſts think, there can folow no goo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of good works, except a man me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and get life by his works: as though the Prophet had ſaid, <hi>The juſt ſhall liue by his good works</hi>: No, he ſaid not ſo: but, <hi>The iuſt ſhall liue by faith. Habac. 2.4.</hi> May not this ſerue them, that God is glorified in well doing? Yee ſee the wordes that are heere, are borrowed from the Vine tree: Then let vs take vp the compariſon, to make the matter more cleare: Wee ſee by experience, that the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Vine tree doe not liue vpon the fruite, nor take no ſappe from the Berries: the Berries doe not furniſhe life to the branches: Therefore can they conclude heereof, that the Berries auaile nothing, becauſe they giue no ſap nor food to the vine tree?
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:16631:54"/>
Hath not the berrie none other vſe? Yes, it hath a better vſe, for it ſerueth chiefely to refreſh and make chearfull the heart of man. It is euen ſo with our good workes, the good workes are not cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of our juſtification, or life: they are but the fruites of juſtification: A man doeth not good workes to bee juſtified; but is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ustified to bring out good workes: they haue their owne vſe: they are not onelie comfortable to them who worke them, to confirme their election, calling, juſtification, and life: but alſo thoſe who ſtand by, and looke to them, the Apoſtle ſayeth, they are edified by their on-looking, as yee may reade in the firſt Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of Peter, and the firſt Chapted: Yea, more edified by one worke, than by a thouſand wordes: And not onelie are men edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but thereby God is glorified. Chriſt ſayeth, <hi>Matth. Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good workes, and maye glorifie your Father which is in Heauen. So by good workes the God of Heauen is glorified, and men are holpen.</p>
            <p>The ſecond argument: <hi>Ye ſhall bee my Diſciples</hi>: As hee would ſay, God ſhall not onlie be glorified, but ye ſhall get good your ſelues: yee ſhall bee my Diſciples. It is the ſame in effect with that which he ſaid, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. <hi>verſ.</hi> 35. By this a man or woman is knowne to be the Diſciple of Chriſt, by mutuall loue. Then let vs ſee what do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is taught in the Schoole of Chriſt: there is the ſumme of the doctrine, Doe well, bring out much good fruite, bring out many good workes. All the doctrine that is taught of fayth, is to the ende that a man may do well. The Apoſtle to <hi>Titus, chap.</hi> 2. <hi>verſ. 11.</hi> telleth vs what is the end of the Goſpel, to wit, that the grace of Ieſus Chriſt hath ſhined in the worlde, that wee may liue ſoberlie, temperatelie and godlilie in this preſent world. So the end of the Goſpel is, that men and women ſhould liue an holy and ſanctified life: and he who liueth an holy life, he is indeed a diſciple of Chriſt: not he who knowes moſt, but he who doth moſt, is the beſt ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler: and he who doth euill, and deliteth in miſchiefe, hath no more to doe with Chriſt, than the Deuill hath. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.20. After that hee hath ſet downe the life of the Gentiles, that they gaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to wantonnes, and to commit wickednes, with all kinde of griedineſſe; he turneth to the Epheſians, and he ſaith, Ye haue not learned Chriſt ſo: whoſoeuer leadeth an euill life vnder the name of a Chriſtian, they haue neuer heard Chriſt ſpeaking to them by his Spirite in their ſoule: Thou haſt not learned at Chriſt to bee a
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:16631:54"/>
murderer, an adulterer, and drunkard. Then if thou wouldeſt ſhewe to the worlde, that thou haſt learned at Chriſt, ſtriue to doe much, and not to ſpeake much: In one worde: As thou wouldeſt ſhew thy ſelfe to bee a Scholler in the Schoole of Chriſt, doe euer many good workes. Then when hee hath exhorted to good works, he commeth to the grounds of good works: the grounds are two, the loue of God, and the loue of thy neighbour: the whole Commandements are grounded on theſe two. Then hee exhorteth his Diſciples to loue: It is not enough to begin to loue Chriſt, but to continue. Hee giueth the argumentes, <hi>J haue loued you,</hi> wherefore then ſhould ye not loue me? The beſt thing we can doe, is to meete him with loue in ſome meaſure, who hath loued vs ſo wel, ſo dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and tenderlie: I haue loued you, therefore loue ye me. And that they ſhould not thinke this a common loue, hee saith, <hi>As the Father hath loued me, ſo loue I you</hi>: I loue you not as men loue men, but as the Father loueth mee. Then wee ſee here, that Ieſus Chriſt is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie aye the firſt louer: (for if we loue him, it is becauſe hee loueth vs firſt: loue aye beginneth on the part of Chriſt: ere wee beginne to thinke to loue him, hee loueth vs:) but alſo wee learne more heere, What kinde of loue Chriſt beareth to vs. <hi>1. John, Chap. 3. verſ. 1.</hi> What a loue hath the Father borne to vs, that hath called vs his ſonnes? So the loue of Chriſt to vs, is a tender loue, ſuch as the loue of the Father is to him: what tongue can expreſſe the loue of the Father to the Sonne? So all the tenderneſſe of the worlde, is nothing to that loue that Chriſt hath to vs: it is paſſing in tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and paſsing in meaſure. Indeede the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of a great ſenſe of this loue to men, <hi>Rom. 5.</hi> where he ſayth, This loue of God is powred out from the Heauens, and powred out in the hearts of men &amp; women. Who doeth it? The holy Spirit ſheddeth it abroade in our heartes: and indeede a man will feele the loue of God in Chriſt, more than the tongue can tell. Looke <hi>Epheſ. 3. verſ. 18.19.</hi> No, Paul nor all the Apoſtles, could not tell the loue that Chriſt beareth to men and women that are ſinners: and in this life we cannot be capable of it, nor yet in the life to come, when we ſhal haue a thouſand times a greater ſenſe: for it is infinit: then we ſhal bee aſtoniſhed, and wonder at it: but wee ſhall bee filled with it there, where God ſhall bee all in all. Abide and walke in fayth, till thou meet with him, and thou ſhalt find this to be true.</p>
            <p>Nowe I ſhall ende: Leſt they ſhould haue thought that the loue they ſhould beare to Chriſt ſhould bee fectleſſe, and ſhould bee clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:16631:55"/>
in, and ſmoared in the heart, and not ſhine into world, the Lord ſaieth, <hi>If yee keepe my Commaundementes, yee ſhall abide in my loue.</hi> Thinke not that the loue of Chriſt can bee in the heart of a man or woman, and then bee ydle: and if wee loue a perſon, wee muſt doe him good: So if a man or woman loue Chriſt, they will goe about, night and daye, to pleaſe him, and to obey his bleſſed will, and his Commaundementes: And if a man haue no will to obeye God, it is ſure, there is no loue in the heart. Well, I ſay, thou who liueſt not an holie life, in that great daye, that will teſtifie againſt thee, that thou neuer louedſt Ieſus Chriſt. So, take heede our hand bee anſwerable to our profeſsion of loue, that good deedes maye followe it: for if thou bee ydle, thou haſt no loue. One thing I marke heere: Vpon what grounde doeth our obedience to Chriſt ariſe? The firſt ground, the loue that a man beareth to Chriſt brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth out obedience: Yet there is an higher ground, <hi>J haue loued you,</hi> ſaieth Chriſt, <hi>therefore abide in my loue.</hi> The loue that Ieſus Chriſt beareth to a ſinner, bringeth out that mutuall loue wee beare to him: When yee ſee a man ſet to keepe the Commaundementes of God, (and bleſſed is that ſoule that ſo doeth:) I ſaye, ſurelie yee may, by all appearance, conclude, that that ſoule loueth Chriſt: And farder, ſurely it appeareth of this obedience, that God loueth this perſon well: and that is a better loue, and a ſtronger ground, than is all his loue to God: and certainlie, the Lord will loue that man exceeding well, whome hee will imploy in his ſeruice. Bleſſed is that creature whome the Lord will imploy in his ſeruice in this life, whatſoeuer calling it be into: and of all bleſsinges in this life, there is the firſt, when wee know the Lord hath choſen vs to ſuch a turne, and giue him thanks therefore. <hi>1. Timoth. Chap. 1. verſ. 12.</hi> Paul being imployed in that Miniſterie, ſaieth, I thanke my God, that hee hath counted me faithfull, to imploy me in that Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. So bleſſed is the ſeruant, who can ſerue Ieſus Chriſt: yea, hee is more happie, that can ſerue Ieſus Chriſt, than he were a King of the worlde: whoſoeuer ſerueth him, whomſoeuer he imployeth in his ſeruice, he ſhall giue him a rich rewarde: Let this therefore bee the ſtrife and endeuour of euery one of vs, to ſerue him.</p>
            <p>Nowe in the latter parte of the tenth verſe, to the end that they ſhould ſhew that loue they bare to him, by keeping his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes, hee layeth out his owne example: <hi>As I,</hi> ſayeth hee, <hi>haue kept the Commaundementes of my Father, and abide in his loue</hi>: that is, Loue mee, as I haue loued my Father: the loue that I beare to my
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:16631:55"/>
Father, is obedience to him: ſo bee ye obedient to mee, if ye loue me. So yee ſee, Brethren, hee layeth out his example of loue and obedience to his Father, to bee followed by his Diſciples. Marke this: The Lord Ieſus is the liuelieſt example of loue and obedience that euer was, or ſhall be in the world. There was neuer ſuch a loue as the Sonne bare to his Father: neuer one ſo obedient as he was<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he obeyed his equall. <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. <hi>verſ.</hi> 6.7.8. He being in the forme of God, he thought it no robbery to be equall with God: Yet hee thought it no ſhame to humble himſelf, to become humble to the death of the Croſſe: Yea, hee not onely ſubmitted himſelfe to his equall, but alſo to his inferiours. Hee waſhed his Diſciples feete, <hi>John,</hi> 13. Hee humbled himſelfe to the world, to ſerue the world. <hi>Rom. Chap.</hi> 15. <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. As the Lord is the true patterne of loue and obedience; ſo is it needefull that his example bee aye laide out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes: for except wee ſee it, there is not ſuch a thing that any man can bee truely humbled, to obey God: for it is the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Ieſus Chriſt, and fayth in him, that reformeth the heart of a ſinner, and maketh of a proude heart an humbled heart: and if thou take not a gripe of that Croſſe by fayth, thine heart ſhall abide vnreformed, till it bee put into Hell. The tongue of man is not able to tell what grace we haue in the obedience of Chriſt: We haue not onely ſaluation, and juſtification, thorow his obedience; but we haue alſo his obedience, to learne vs what obedience wee ſhould giue to him, and what we ſhould giue to God. Learne at me to be humble, ſayth the Lord, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. <hi>verſ.</hi> 29. Marke another thing concerning this matter: Whileſt he is exhorting to loue, and to the keeping of his Commandement, hee giueth himſelfe an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample moſt liuely of that thing wherevnto hee exhorteth them. This is a leſſon for all others, who teach into the Kirke of Chriſt: whatſoeuer doctrine they teach, let them not onely bee ſpeakers, but doers of that which they teach: otherwayes they will deſtroy more with their life, than they are able to build vp with their doctrine.</p>
            <p>In the next verſe, hee concludeth all this, and ſetteth downe the end of his exhortation: <hi>Theſe thinges haue I ſpoken to you, thay my joye might abide in you, and that your joye might bee full</hi>: All is for your weale, that ye may be repleniſhed with joy: all mine exhortations tend to your joy. The end of Chriſt is joy: indeed hee beginneth with a ſadneſſe and heauineſſe: Learne how yee ſhall come to him: the firſt ſtep by the which the ſinner commeth to Chriſt, is by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:16631:56"/>
by the ſight of ſinne, and that bringeth ſadneſſe vvith it: but frae once the ſinner hath gotten that ſight of Chriſt, then the heart is full of joy, and departeth with joy: and all the ſpeach the Lord ſpeaketh to a ſinner, is to put joye into the heart of the ſinner: whatſoeuer diſpleaſure the ſinner hath in the meane time, yet all is for this, that in the ende hee ſhould rejoyce: And the ende of the ſpeaches hee ſpeaketh to his Diſciples, exhorting them to that vnion, and good workes, and loue, and obedience, and ſocietie, and communion with Chriſt, is joye: Good workes bring joye in the ende: The loue of Chriſt filleth the heart vvith joye: there was neuer the like of it, eſſay it and ſee: loue the Lord, and thou ſhalt finde ſuch a joye, as the worlde knoweth not: loue Chriſt, and thou ſhalt haue a good conſcience: and a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience bringeth with it joye, reſt, and peace. So the ende of all is joye to the heart of a ſinner: the vnion with Chriſt bringeth with it an vnſpeakeable joy. Reade 1. <hi>John,</hi> 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. After he hath beene ſpeaking of the communion with the Father, and the Sonne, hee ſubjoyneth, Theſe things write I vnto you, that your ioye might bee full. And if wee bee not in ſocietie with that bleſſed Trinitie, wee haue no matter of ioye: and therefore we ſhould euer ſtriue to get a communion with that bleſſed Trinitie, for therein ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the happineſſe of man.</p>
            <p>Nowe to marke the wordes more narrowly, hee tearmeth it firſt, <hi>His joye:</hi> then hee tearmeth it, <hi>Their joye</hi>: ſo it is both the ioye of Chriſt, and alſo of his Diſciples, but in diuerſe reſpectes: It is the ioye of Chriſt, becauſe hee is the giuer of it: all ioye proceedeth of Ieſus Chriſt: It is our ioye, becauſe it belongeth to vs, and is giuen vs. So then, what is the ioye of a Chriſtian man? Learne it heere, It is nothing but the participation of that heauenly ioye that is in God: God is full of ioye, and his whole nature is ioye: the ioye that one hath, who belieueth in Chriſt, is a part of that diuine nature, 2. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> of <hi>Peter, Chap. 1. verſ. 4.</hi> of that ioye that paſſeth all vnderſtanding: there is the felicitie of man, to get apart of that infinite ioye.</p>
            <p>The Philoſophers diſputed much about the felicitie of man: ſome of them placed it in pleaſure: the generall is not euill, but here they failed, that they placed it in a beaſtly pleaſure: Indeede it ſtandeth in the participation of that ioye of God, begun in this life, and perfected in the Heauen, when wee ſhall ſee Chriſt Ieſus face to face. The ioy we haue here is mingled with ſorrow, and for
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:16631:56"/>
one ioyfull houre, we haue aye ten ſad: but then all teares ſhall be wiped away from our eyes, when God ſhall bee all in all, and ſhall be filling the ſoules of his owne with ioye.</p>
            <p>In the next verſe, hee commeth to the other grounde of good works: The loue to man, the firſt was the loue of God: thinke not: that thou canſt doe a good thing, and if thou loue not thy neighbour. The wordes are, <hi>This is my Commandement, That yee loue one another, as I haue loued you.</hi> Loue will not ſtand on one ſide onely, but it muſt bee mutuall, otherwayes thou canſt not ſtand in that ſocietie either with God, or with man. Yee heard before this, of the Lord, <hi>If ye abide in my Commandements, ye ſhall abide in my loue.</hi> So the loue of Ieſus Chriſt, is to keep his Commandements. This Commandement is not ſo much the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of the firſt Table, as the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of the ſecond Table. The true touch-ſtone whereby is tried whether thou loueſt God or not, in thine heart, as is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded in the firſt Table, is the loue to thy neighbour, which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded in the ſecond Table: ſo that if thou wilt ſtand vp, &amp; ſay, I loue God, God will anſwere, Loueſt thou thy neighbour? &amp; if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e find an hatred in thine heart to thy neighbour, he will anſwere, Thou loueſt me not. Hee who hateth his neighbour, hateth God. Well, let men continue on in murder, &amp; wrongfull dealing, &amp; ſtand vp, &amp; ſay, We loue God, they lie. Mark another thing: there appears here a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull loue the Lord beares to his members on earth: no tong can expreſſe it: That loue the creature would vtter to him, he will haue it turned ouer on his members in the earth: I meane not as though the Lord would haue none of our loue to himſelfe, or regarded it not, &amp; ſo bade vs loue one another: No, for he deliteth exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to be loued by vs: But that loue wee beare to him, hee biddeth vs kythe it on his members, and doe good to them. And what is the cauſe that the Lord biddeth vs loue his members? The Lord himſelfe is perfect: Our Head is full of all felicitie: but as for the members, they haue great need of things ſpirituall and temporal: So the Head is not to bee benefited by vs: but the beſt member, though hee were a King, hath neede to be holpen, and the beggar may helpe him: And ſo, ſeeing He hath no need, he turneth the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of our loue, ouer to vs his members, who haue need therof. Dauid profeſſeth this, <hi>Pſal. 16. verſ. 2.3. Help me Lord,</hi> he ſaith. And leſt the Lord ſhould anſwere, What good canſt thou doe mee? he meeteth this, I cannot doe thee good: my well-doing extendeth not to thee: thou art all ſufficient: but, Lord, keepe mee to thy
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:16631:57"/>
Sainctes on the earth: howbeit my good cannot helpe thee, yet, Lord, keepe me to thy Saincts. Farder, ye ſee he requireth mutuall loue: for except loue be mutuall, men cannot bee united: the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that body are conjoyned with loue: albeit thou bee loued, yet if thou loue not againe, thou art not of the body.</p>
            <p>When he hath exhorted them to loue one another, hee ſetteth downe his owne example, <hi>As I haue loued you,</hi> euery one of you loue another. Seeing hee loued them ſo well, why ſhould not they loue one another? As before when he exhorted them to loue him, that is, to loue God, hee laide downe before them his owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; ſo now hee exhorteth them to loue their neighbour by his example. Wee learne by this, the Lord Ieſus is the liuely example of all true loue, either to God, or to man: and the example of the loue of Chriſt is needefull to moue vs to loue man in this worlde: ſo that except we ſenſibly find that loue of his in our heartes, there ſhall bee no ſpunke of true loue to man in the heart: for why? all this loue we beare to God, and to man, ariſeth vpon the feeling of that loue of Chriſt, ſhed abroad in our hearts: hee muſt warme our heartes by his loue; and then ſhall ariſe the loue of God, and of man: Except a man feele that God loue him, hee cannot loue: for our loue is but a repercution of that loue wherewith hee ſtriketh on our hearts.</p>
            <p>Then in the next verſe, he layeth out the loue he bare to them in the owne greatneſſe, and that by compariſon: <hi>No man can haue a greater loue than this, that he lay downe his life for his friend</hi>: but I haue laide downe my life for you: there yee ſee what a loue I beare to you. The greateſt token of loue in the worlde, is, when a man is content to lay downe his life for another. Indeede it is a great to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of loue, when a tender friende will laye downe his life for his friend. <hi>Rom. 5. verſ. 7.</hi> Scarcely will a man lay downe his life for the juſt: but when a man will be content to giue his life for his enemy, that is a greater token of loue: there is not ſuch a token of loue in the worlde, as this.</p>
            <p>Nowe to come to Ieſus Chriſt: The Lord Ieſus died not for his friends: he had neuer a friend in the world, till he died; and by his death he purchaſed friends: No man euer loued the Lord Ieſus, but by vertue of his death. Looke the fift Chap. to the <hi>Rom. verſ. 8.</hi> This commendeth his loue, that hee died for vs, ſinners, and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to him. There was neuer ſuch a loue, as the loue of Chriſt to man, who ſuffered ſo ſhamefull a death in the body, and ſo great
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:16631:57"/>
anguiſh in conſcience. Indeede all men will ſay in worde, that that loue was wonderfull: but all the difficultie is to feele in the heart the greatneſſe of the loue of Chriſt, and to apprehende it. Except there be ſome ſenſe in the heart, the heart is but ſicke, and euill diſpoſed: And therefore this was a point of Pauls prayer for the <hi>Epheſians, Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 18.19. Hee prayeth for them on his knees to God, that the Epheſians, being rooted and grounded in loue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> might be able to comprehend, with all the Saincts, what the hope is of his calling, and what the riches of his glorious inheritance is in the Sainctes, and what is the breadth, what is the length, what is the infinitneſſe of the loue of Chriſt, that yee may knowe the loue of Chriſt, which paſſeth all vnderſtanding. There is no ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without that ſenſe: no peace, no reſt, no joy: for of all things vnder the Heauen, wee ſhould ſeeke to feele it the moſt, and ſaye, Lord, as thou haſt loued mee, ſo let mee feele it. If thou wouldeſt, feele this loue, get an aſſurance that the Lord hath died for thee, when thou waſt a ſinner; for therevpon ſhall riſe ſuch a ſenſe in thy heart, as thou neuer felt before: Firſt feele that thou waſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to die vnder ſinne and the law: then get an aſſurance that hee died for thee, and ſhed his blood that thou mighteſt bee free. That ſinfull woman, who waſhed the Lordes feet with her teares, and dried them with the haires of her head, and kiſſed his feete, and anointed them with oyntment, was filled with the ſenſe of the loue of Ieſus Chriſt: Except the loue of Ieſus Chriſt had loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the heart of her, ſhee had not had one teare: Shee was a great ſinner: and hee ſayeth, Becauſe much is forgiuen her, ſhee loueth me the better, <hi>Luke,</hi> 7. <hi>verſ.</hi> 47. The moe ſinnes that are forgiuen a ſinner, when be getteth this ſenſe, that Chriſt died for him, he wil loue him the better. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. Paul ſayeth, The loue of God in Chriſt is ſhed out into the heart: ere euer that loue be ſhed out, the blood of Chriſt muſt bee ſhed out, and the heart muſt gripe to his death, and bee waſhen with his blood, and bathed in it: and when the ſinner feeleth that, then floweth that ſweetneſſe of his loue; and there is a mutuall loue betwixt the heart of the ſinner, and Ieſus Chriſt; and the ſinner will feele ſuch an exceeding loue, that he will defie all the world, as Paul ſayth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>verſ.</hi> 35. The Diſciples might haue ſaid, We ſee thou doeſt for thy friendes, and ſheweſt a great loue to thy friends: are we thy friends? The Lord meeteth this, <hi>Yee are my friendes</hi>; but vnder this condition, <hi>If ye loue mee, and doe my will,</hi> ye are my friendes. Surely when wee heare ſuch
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:16631:58"/>
conditions as theſe, That the Lord hath laide downe his ſoule for his friends, we ſhould ſearch to know, if we be of that number, and ſhould ſay to our hearts, I ſee the Lord hath died for his friendes, am I one of the friendes of Ieſus Chriſt? There is no life without his death: and he died for none, but for his friends: and euery one of you who heareth me this day, ſhould trie your ſelues, if yee bee the friendes of the Lord: Yee ſhall knowe it by this, if yee bee his friends, ye ſhall not be fectleſſe. What ſerueth a fectleſſe profeſsion for in the mouth, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the heart is contrarious? What ſerueth ſucha a friend for, as is a friend in the mouth, &amp; a foe in the heart? Look if thou haſt an heart bent to doe his will: take heede to thy tong, and to the motions of thine heart, that they bee ſanctified: and if thy tong be ſoule, and thine hand be bathed with murder, if thou ſeeſt this, thine heart will teſtifie to thee, that thou haſt nothing to doe with Chriſt; the loue of Chriſt hath nothing adoe with thee; but that carcage of thine, and that ſoule of thine, ſhall bee dragged to Hell, if thou abide in that eſtate: But if thou finde in ſome meaſure a delite to pleaſure him, who hath pleaſured thee, &amp; died for thee: (Fie on him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who will not ſtriue to pleaſure him!) If thou find in ſome meaſure good actions fall out of thine hand, then thou mayeſt haue a good conſcience, and the heart will get a piece of that reſt and peace which paſſeth all vnderſtanding: When a creature ſeeth, that hee hath beene doing nothing all day but euill, ſleepe as thou wilt, and wake as thou wilt, thou haſt the curſe of God vpon thee.</p>
            <p>Bleſſed is the man who hath good workes, for they are tokens vnto him, that hee is ſealed vp in the blood of Chriſt. Wee muſt not gather out of this place, that becauſe we were friends to Ieſus, therefore hee died for vs: for by the contrary, becauſe hee died for vs, therefore he made vs his friends. Hee had neuer a friend, till by his death hee acquired them. And if thou finde the force of his death in thee, thou muſt bee his friende, and muſt preaſſe to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure him: To whome, with the Father, and Holy Spirite, bee all prayſe, honour, and glory, for euermore.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Itherto in this Chapter (Beloued in the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus) wee haue heard of ſundrie exhortations which the Lord, being to depart out of this world, giueth to his Diſciples, who are to abide in this world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him: Firſt hee exhorteth them to abide in that vnion with him: Then hee exhorteth them to good workes: Therefore hee commeth to the groundes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of all good workes: There are two groundes, The firſt is the loue of God: the next, the loue of man. Therefore hee exhorteth them firſt to the loue of God: next, to the loue of man. He ſetteth downe his owne example to them, to mooue them to loue. The greatneſſe of his loue to them hee ſetteth downe in compariſon, I layde downe my life for you: then there cannot bee a greater loue, than that I beare to you. And leſt they ſhould doubt of his friendſhip, Yee are my friendes, ſayeth hee, and therefore my death appertaineth vnto you. And leſt that friendſhip ſhoulde ſeeme to ſtande in worde onelie, hee ſubjoyneth a condition, Keepe my Commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, if ye would be my friendes. In this Text we haue read, in the beginning thereof, it might haue bene ſaid by the Diſciples,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:16631:59"/>
they were rather to be called ſeruants than friends. The Lord mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth this, and ſayth, <hi>Hencefoorth call I you not ſervantes</hi>: for why? this is the condition of a ſeruant: he knoweth not the will of his Maſter: the Maſter will not call him to his counſell: but I, whatſoeuer thing I haue heard of my Father, being in the boſome of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I haue reuealed it to you, and therefore I call you friendes. The meaning of the Text is eaſie: I obſerue this, It is true indeed, the Diſciples of Ieſus Chriſt, they were ſeruants, and will bee ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes to him foreuer. If yee will ſeeke the ground of it, it is not onely the creation, (for the creature is a ſeruant: all the Angels of Heauen are creatures, therefore ſeruants:) but the chiefe grounde why they were ſeruants, was by vertue of that redemption. When they were ſolde to ſinne, and to the Deuill, the Lord payed for them a precious ranſome. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. The Lord died for vs, and reuiued, and all to this ende, that hee ſhould haue dominion ouer the quicke and the dead, and bee Lord ouer them whom hee hath redeemed. <hi>2. Corin.</hi> 5. <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. Paul ſayeth, Conſidering the Lord hath died for me, and riſen, from hencefoorth I will not liue to my ſelfe, but to Chriſt. So thus the Apoſtles were ſeruantes to Chriſt: another way alſo, they were his ſeruantes by their calling: were they not Ambaſſadours of Chriſt? Nowe an Ambaſſadour is aye a ſeruant to him who ſendeth him. The Apoſtles of Chriſt were ſeruants, by creation, by redemption, and by vocation: But by this manner and kind of ſeruice, that they are ſeruants by redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and vocation, they are not ſeruants only, but friends. Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they be, that are redeemed by the blood of Ieſus Chriſt, they are not onely ſeruantes, but friendes: they ſit in counſell with the Lord, whome the Lord hath redeemed: they get leaue to come in to the Chamber of the Bridegrome: And as Iohn the Baptiſt ſayth, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 29. As friendes to the Bridegrome, they ſtand in the Bridegromes Chamber, and heare him, and rejoyce: they heare him ſweetly: Yea, hee counteth vs more than friendes, the Lord maketh vs his Brethren: They are Sonnes of adoption, and as they are Sonnes, they get the Spirit of adoption, teſtifying to them, that they are Brethren. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. They crie, Abba Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But yee will aske, Wherefore is it then, that the Lord will not call them ſeruants, but friendes? I anſwere, The Lord hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the common ſort of ſeruantes, or rather of ſlaues. In thoſe dayes the Maſters communicated not their counſell to them, but commanded them, vnder ſuch a paine, to doe their will. Hee reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:16631:59"/>
this, and hee denieth ſuch ſeruitude to his Diſciples. It is true, in this world there are not onlie ſeruants that are brethren to the Lord: but the Lord hath manie ſlaues, men and women <hi>2. Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth. Chap. 2. verſ. 20.</hi> In a great houſe, there are not onlie veſſels of golde and ſiluer, but alſo of wood, and of leame, ſome to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, ſome to diſhonour. All this world is the Houſe of the Lord, and in this worlde, hee hath ſome ſeruantes in an honourable ranke, and manie ſlaues, yea, moe than ſeruantes who are free: the world is full of ſlaues. Now theſe ſlaues, they are bound to ſeruice by vertue of creation, &amp; ſo is the Deuill. As for the redemdtion theſe ſlaues haue no part of it: and ſo it followeth, that hauing no part of that redemption, they haue no friendſhip with him: and being no friendes, they are no brethren: they gette not that bleſſed Spirite: but that Spirite which in the eight Chapter to the Romanes is called the Spirite of bondage and ſlauerie, which maketh them to feare for vengeance: They ſerue Chriſt, but all that ſeruice is euill, they are murthering men, they committe adulterie, their mouthes are full of blaſphemie, all their ſeruice is to euill: and it is but the breaking of the Lordes Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet it is his ſeruice. In the ſecond Chapter of the Actes of the Apoſtles, and the thirteenth verſe, and Chap. 4. verſ. 28. The Deuill, and all his inſtruments, can doe nothing, but that thy hand hath ordained. The Lord hath decreed all to be done: &amp; they ſhall gette their rewarde for doing. The Diſciples were free ſeruants of the Lord: as for ſlaues, they were not. Seeing all muſt bee his ſeruantes, wee ought carefullie to conſider, what ſort of veſſels, and in what ranke of ſeruantes wee are. The Apoſtle Paul, when hee hath tolde of this difference, whereof wee ſhewe in the great houſe, in the ſecond Epiſtle of Timothie, Chap. 2. verſ. 30. hee ſubjoyneth a token, whereby a man ſhall know whether hee bee a veſſell of honour, or diſhonour: Men ſhall well know whether they bee ordained to ſlauerie or not: Looke if they bee cleanſed from the filth of this worlde: looke if they be ſanctified veſſels, to work good in the houſe of the Lord: and if thou bee a foule veſſell, who can doe no good, ſaye with thy ſelfe, I haue no warrand that I haue to doe with the Lord Ieſus: and ſaye, that thou art a veſſell to deſtruction. And bleſſed is that ſoule that feeleth ſome piece of deſire with joye to doe well: for they haue a warrande, that they are veſſels of honour, and that they ſhall bee in Heauen with the LORD: So ſanctification is the moſt infallible token of our
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:16631:60"/>
election and juſtification. Whereas hee ſayeth, All thinges that I haue heard of my Father, haue I made knowne to you, I marke this, That Chriſt, who came out of the boſome of his Father, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed to his Diſciples the whole counſell of God concerning the ſaluation of the worlde, which the Apoſtles preached thereafter fully to the worlde: for the holy Spirit called all thinges to their remembrance, which they had heard of the Lord, <hi>Iohn,</hi> 14. <hi>verſ.</hi> 26. And Paul, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. <hi>verſ.</hi> 27. profeſſeth, that he had kept no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing backe, but hee had ſhewed them all the counſell of God. It may be asked, whether all thinges that Chriſt himſelfe preached, and that the Apoſtles thereafter preached, bee fully ſet downe in writ? I anſwere, All things according to the matter and ſubſtance, albeit not in as many wordes, are left in regiſter: and wee affirme, That if Chriſt himſelfe were here preſent, hee would ſay no more, write no more, change nor alter nothing, according to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
            <p>In the next verſe hee beginneth to giue an ordinance to preach after his departure, as yee reade in the 28. Chapter of <hi>Matthew, verſ.</hi> 19. Before he lay downe the ordinance, hee premitteth ſome words to prepare the hearts of his Diſciples to accept of it: <hi>J haue choſen you, and ye haue not choſen mee</hi>: therefore I haue ordained yee ſhould goe out, and bring out fruit. As the Lord would ſay, I haue choſen you to be Apoſtles to me, before yee thought ſuch a thing: I ſought you firſt, and ye ſought not mee: I preuented you, and ſo this office is of my grace: there is no cauſe in you, but the whole is aſcribed to mee. Was Peter ſeeking Chriſt, when hee was fiſhing? Was Matthew ſeeking Chriſt, when hee was ſitting at the Table with the Publicanes? <hi>Matth. 9. verſ. 9.</hi> Had Paul any mind of Chriſt, when hee was going to Damaſcus, to perſecute the poore Saincts of God? It is a good thing to knowe howe much Paul ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged this grace. Looke the firſt Chapter to the <hi>Gal. verſ. 15.</hi> When it had pleaſed the Lord to ſeparate mee from my mothers wombe, he called me by his grace, to reueale his Sonne to me, that I might preach him amongſt the Gentiles. See in howe pitthie words he ſetteth it downe. The ground of Pauls calling, was the good wil of God: and higher, the eternall ſeparation of him from his mothers wombe: and laſt, hee commeth to the grace of God. But this is the thing I marke: We ſee the Lord he groundeth his ordinance to his Diſciples vpon his owne free grace: In election the Lord will haue all our calling to depend vpon his mercy only:
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:16631:60"/>
hee will haue his grace to preuent vs. I am founde of them who ſought me not. Who dare ſay, I ſought the Lord, before he ſought me? He will be the firſt caller of vs, to the end, that he ſhould haue a right to command vs what hee pleaſeth. Another ende, that hee commanding vs to doe it, with our whole hearts wee ſhould giue obedience, and ſay, Lord, I will anſwere thee. Bee not deceiued, the Papiſts are full of vanitie, they labour to ſet vp men with pride to diſobey God: that doctrine they teach maketh men proude: for when they ſpeake of workes of preparation, before their calling, and of a free-will, when they are called, whereto tendeth this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but to bereaue God of that power hee hath ouer vs? Let this enter into our hearts once, We haue not all our grace of God; the Deuill ſeeketh no better: they thinke not, that they are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether debt-bound to God: and if they doe him any ſeruice, they thinke he is in their common. The way to keepe our hearts in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, and to diſpoſe them in lowlineſſe, is to thinke nothing of our ſelues: they that thinke that they haue nothing in nature, but rebellion, and hatred of all grace, they aſcribe all to God, and prayſe him, and they will ſay, Lord, ſeeing I haue no grace except thou giue mee it, and if thou bid mee ſuffer, I will ſuffer ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand deaths. But weigh the words: In theſe words, <hi>that they ſhould goe, and bring out fruit,</hi> hee alludeth to the Vine tree: what is that, <hi>to bring out fruite</hi>? that is, they ſhall vantage, and win ſoules to God: and of all fruites, it is the beſt, to win loſt ſoules to Ieſus Chriſt, to dwell with him in Heauen: to drawe them out of that damnation, he ordaineth that they ſhould not begin only, but that their fruit ſhould abide: that is, they ſhould continue all the time of their life to win ſoules to Ieſus Chriſt, and ſhould continue vnto the ende. Nowe knowe this, It is not enough in any calling once co begin to doe well, to fructifie; but there muſt be perſeuerance to the end: the ende of all our well doing muſt bee with our laſt ende: Let our labours in this life, and our life goe together: At all ſeaſons, a tree will not bring out fruite: but it is required in a Chriſtian, that hee bring euermore out fruit at all times: they haue no ſeaſon by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. And as this is requiſite in all men, ſo chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>fely is it requisite in them who are called to the Miniſterie, that they bee winning ſoules, and aye doing good, one way or other: no reſt for a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, but of all men, it is moſt requiſite that hee doe good.

            <p>Now, that man is happie, in this life that layeth this grounde, There is no reſting for mee heere: I muſt not ſit downe: I am in a courſe going to Heauen: and ſo with an holy courage goeth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, running on in his pilgrimage: for in the ende, hee ſhall get that Sabbath day of reſt, and he ſhall eate ſweetlie the fruits of his trauels. But if thou reſteſt in this life, and wilt not labour in thy calling in this life, and ſeekeſt thy reſt in ſinne, (for let him ſitte ydle, he ſhall reſt in ſinne and wickedneſſe,) thou ſhalt not get reſt afterwarde. There is no ſoule that will ſit downe in the race, that ſhall reſt with God in the Heauens. Alace, we ſet not that crowne of glorie before our eyes, and that is the cauſe wee runne not: but bleſſed is that ſoule that will take paine.</p>
            <p>In the end of the verſe, to mooue them to doe well in their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, he giueth them another argument, <hi>Whatſoeuer they ſhould aske in his Name, they ſhould get it.</hi> The world wanteth grace, for fault of asking. So the Lord would ſaye, Goe forwarde, and what yee ſhall aske in my Name, at my Father, (for without faith in him, wee will not be heard,) he will giue it you. The Lord obſcurely would meete a doubt. It is hard for vs to doe well in this worlde: howe many impedimentes are in man? and howe many without him? And ſo, ere thou doe any good, theſe muſt bee remooued: So they might haue ſaid, It is hard for vs, being ſo few, to goe out into the world: it is hard for vs to begin, and farre harder to perſeuere. To this hee anſwereth, Aske at my Father, in my Name, and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ye ſhall aske in my Name, yee ſhall get it. Well doing is gotten by begging: and he or ſhee that will begin to doe any good turne, muſt beg it at the handes of him who hath grace to giue. So well doing beginneth at prayer: and continuance in well doing, depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vpon continuance in prayer. Thou who wouldeſt continue in well doing, be aye praying, and aye asking. Paul, <hi>Epheſ. 6. verſ. 18.</hi> exhorteth the Chriſtian man of euery ranke, to ſtand continuallie in Armour, ſo long as he liueth. Amongſt all the Armour, he ſaith, Euer pray, with all manner of prayer. There cannot be a ſtanding, without there be a continuance in prayer, night and day. There is nothing more requiſite, if thou wouldeſt doe well, than to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:16631:61"/>
in prayer: for why? all grace is in Heauen: except wee gette grace drawne out of Heauen, from God, wee cannot doe any good turne: and the only way to draw grace from Chriſt, (for hee is full of grace,) is, firſt to belieue in him, and to bee grounded on him: then next, with open mouth and heart to pray in his Name to the Father; &amp; centainly, Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; earth ſhal go together, ere thou want grace: ere God deny thee thy prayer, al ſhalbe turned vpſide down: &amp; thou ſhalt get that grace he thinks meet for thee in this life, and Heauen at length. In the next verſe, as before he hath enarmed his Diſciples, whom hee was to ſend out to the world with a piece of armour, to wit, prayer; ſo here he enarms them with another, <hi>I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you to loue euery one another.</hi> How needful it is that euery man &amp; woman, who would do wel, ſhould haue loue, Paul, <hi>1. Cor. 13.</hi> ſhews. Let a man do all the things in the world, yea, giue his body to be burnt, if there be no loue in the heart, alauailes not: But chiefly to come to a Miniſter, of all men it is moſt requiſite that a Miniſter haue loue in his hart: otherways all is nothing, all his language &amp; preaching auailes nought, if the heart haue not a loue of the ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man and woman. So the thing he regardeth, is that loue be in their heart. Yee knowe what a loue Paul had: he had ſo great a loue to the ſafety of his kinſmen, that he would haue wiſhed to be <hi>Anathema</hi> for them: looke what a loue he vttereth, <hi>2. Cor. 6. verſ. 11.</hi> he ſaith, <hi>O Corinthians! our mouth is open to you, our heart is made large: yee are not kept ſtraite in vs, but yee are kept ſtraite in your owne bowels.</hi> So there are manie graces required in a Miniſter, but chiefelie loue: and if hee haue no loue, hee will not care by, howe manie periſhe. Yet farder: they ſhould not onelie haue loue to their people; but alſo Paſtors ſhould haue mutuall loue amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: they ſhoulde haue vnitie of heart, goe where they will. There is nothing that ſerueth more for making vp of that bodie of CHRIST, than the ſweete agreeing of the Labourers: when they agree, the worke of the Lord goeth forward: as worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, when they worke together in one vnion, the worke goeth forwarde. And a man who carrieth enuie in his heart, hee ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer preach Chriſt truelie, but hypocriticallie. Paul, in the firſt Chapter to the <hi>Philippians, verſ.</hi> 15. hee ſpeaketh of two ſortes of Preachers: Some, ſaith he, preach to increaſe mine affliction, ſome of loue. Then he ſaith, What then? yet CHRIST is preached, all maner of wayes, whether it be vnder a pretence, or ſincerely, and I therein joy, yea, &amp; will joy. He ſpeaks this in his bands. So who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:16631:62"/>
hath contention againſt his fellow-labourer, preach as they will preach, they make the Goſpel a cloake to couer their malice and hypocriſie. Vpon the other part, they onely who haue intiere loue to their fellow-labourers, teach Chriſt ſincerely. Wee ſee the Apoſtles, when they make mention of their fellow-labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, howe honourably they ſtile them, what great affection they vtter vnto them: as Paul, when hee ſpeaketh of Timothie, Titu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and others.</p>
            <p>Now I goe forward: <hi>If the world hate you, yee know that it hated mee before you.</hi> This is the third part of the Chapter, wherein he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth them againſt the hatred and perſecution of the world: and ſo hee warneth them to goe out after his departure: I knowe well enough, the world will hate you. Then he comforteth them with his example, Haue they not hated mee before you? There is the ground, The ſeruant is not greater than his Maſter. The Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus is worth all the Apoſtles and Miniſters that euer were. Shall the ſeruant ſtart, and runne, when he is hated, ſeeing the great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and malice the Lord ſuffered? No man in the worlde ſuffered ſo great perſecution as the Lord, and ſo patiently: And had it not beene that the Lord Ieſus tooke on that euill, thou ſhouldeſt haue ſuffered more than the hatred of the world: that is, the very wrath of God. So to moue them to patience, hee layeth downe his owne example, as before he proponed his example to loue God, to keep his Commandements, and loue their neighbour: So hee commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth neuer a thing to them without his owne example. There is nothing that the Lord will bid thee doe, but hee will let thee ſee that ſame firſt done by him: Hee ſetteth himſelfe before vs as a patterne. And as concerning this patience in ſuffering, it is neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that this example of Ieſus Chriſt bee euer before the eyes of any that woulde ſuffer: for it is againſt our nature, to ſuffer anie waye: Yea, it is ſo needefull, that there was neuer a man or woman who ſuffered, if they had not had that ſuffering of Ieſus before them, that could ſuffer patiently. The example of all the patience in the worlde, will not cauſe one to ſuffer patiently, except thou get a ſenſe of that ſuffering: for faith in Chriſt Ieſus, is the ground of all well doing: Ieſus Chriſt muſt be in thine heart, ere there bee any good vertue in thine heart: for it is faith in Chriſt Ieſus, that reformeth the heart: Except wee haue him in the heart, there is no good in it. Therefore Paul, when he recommendeth any vertue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, hee vſeth to ſet before vs the example of Chriſt, as a moſte
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:16631:62"/>
forcible argument: as when hee exhorteth vs to modeſtie, hee ſaieth, Let the ſame minde bee in you, which was in Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Philip. Chap. 2. verſe. 5.</hi> And when hee commendeth patience, in bearing the infirmities of weake brethren, hee bringeth his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: For Chriſt alſo, ſaieth hee, would not pleaſe himſelfe, <hi>Rom. Chap. 15. verſ. 3.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then, if thou wouldeſt haue loue, or meekneſſe, or anie vertue into thine heart, haue the Lord into thine heart, and caſt thine eye vpon him. In one word, belieue in Ieſus Chriſt: and getting a ſight of him, thou ſhalt finde a ſweete change of thy nature: then thou ſhalt bee an holie liuer, and a patient ſufferer, and thou ſhalt growe in all good vertue, and that through Chriſt Ieſus: To whom, with the Father, and the Spirit of Trueth, bee all praiſe, honour, and glorie, foreuermore. AMEN.</p>

The words here, are <hi>that they ſhould go, &amp; bring out f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uit</hi>: that is, win ſoules to the kingdome of Heauen. Secondly, he ſets down the ground of his ordinance: he ſets downe what right he hath to giue it: <hi>I haue choſen you, &amp; ye haue not choſen me,</hi> ſaith he: I preuented you, when there was no ſuch thing in your mind: &amp; therfore I haue juſt right to giue you this ordinance. After he hath giuen this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, he begins to furniſh them, &amp; inarme the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt the time they ſhold paſſe out: the firſt piece of armour was prayer: <hi>they ſhold pray to the Father.</hi> But how? <hi>In his Name.</hi> Look they heart in prayer be grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by faith in Ieſus Chriſt. The next piece of their armour, is loue, &amp; chiefly that loue which euery one ſhould beare to another: they ought not only loue him, whom they teach: but the fellow la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers ſhould loue mutually: when the fellow-labourers agree among themſelues, then the work of the Lord goes forward plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly. The third piece of armour, is patience, that they ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer patiently all the hatred of the world. Now he inſisteth vpon this place, and vſeth ſundry arguments: The firſt he had, was from his owne example: hee ſaieth, <hi>Haue they not hated mee before you</hi>? then why ſhould yee take it heauily, that the worlde hate you? for <hi>the seruant is not greater than his Master.</hi> I goe forward. In the beginning of this Text, we haue the ſecond argument, whereby the Lord mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth his Diſciples to beare patiently the hatred of the world: <hi>If yee were of the world, the world would loue his owne,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>but becauſe ye are not of the worlde, but I haue choſen you out of the worlde, therefore the worlde hateth you.</hi> The meaning is this in effect, If the world hate you, it is a good token, that I haue choſen you out of the vvorlde,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:16631:63"/>
and relieued you from that damnation which ye were ſubject to. Ye ſee in this argument, when the world loueth any man, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie it is a token that there is little good in that man: for the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked worlde, ordained for damnation, will loue no man without a cauſe, except it find a conformitie with it: And as Paul ſaieth, <hi>Rom. 12. verſ. 2.</hi> except it find a likeneſſe in humour and affection, it will not loue a man. It is true, wicked men will loue a good man, but neuer for any good, neuer for Gods cauſe, but for ſome particular reſpect, as kinred, alliance, blood, or ſome policie: But for a good cauſe, wicked men will neuer loue a good man. By the contrarie, when the worlde hateth a man, it is a token there is ſome good in that man. Ere euer the worlde beginne to hate a man, God loueth him: Ere euer the worlde beginne to ſhoote that man out of the worlde, the Lord hath exempted him out of the worlde. It is true indeede, the worlde will hate a wicked man, as a man who doeth great and horrible murders, committeth adulterie, and inceſt, &amp;c. but the worlde will neuer hate wickedneſſe for wickedneſſe cauſe, becauſe it is an offence to God, but for ſome priuate hurt and dammage; as becauſe he is noyſome to the Common-wealth, and troubleſome to the peace of the Countrey, and ſuch like. This ſame which I ſpeake of men, may bee well drawne to Religion: That Religion which the multitude of the worlde runneth after, is not moſt to be approued: No, the Lord ſaue me from it. Neither that Religion which the world deteſteth, is to be rejected: No, the hatred of the Deuill, and of the world, is a good to ken. When the world hateth godly men, there is matter of patience, and of joye: and it is a ſure token, the hatred of the worlde ſhall not ſo ſoone touch the heart, but as ſoone the Lord ſhall meet it with his loue: and the greater the hatred bee, the greater ſhall the loue of God be. <hi>Rom. 5. verſ. 3.</hi> Faith worketh patience, patience experience, to wit, of the fauour and loue of God: which hee ſaith afterward, is ſhed abroad, by his holy Spirit, into our hearts.</p>
            <p>I goe forward: The third argument, <hi>Remember,</hi> ſaieth the Lord, <hi>the word that I ſaide to you, The ſeruant is not greater than his Master</hi>: Looke what they did to me, they will doe the ſame to you. As hee would ſay, It may ſuffice you to be in that eſtate that I was in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you: for why? yee are but ſeruantes, and I am the Lord: and therefore it may ſuffice you well, to bee in that eſtate that I haue bene in before you. He calleth them to remembrance of that word which he ſpake before in the <hi>13. Chap.</hi> and <hi>16. verſ.</hi> when he exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:16631:64"/>
them to humilitie. Would any man or woman after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Chriſt, be humbled, lowly, and obedient, and patient; let them euer holde their eyes vpon Ieſus Chriſt and vpon that high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and Lordſhip, wherein hee ſitteth at the right hand of the Father: and then when thou ſeeſt howe high hee is, looke downe to thy ſelfe, and thou ſhalt ſee, the fardeſt that thou canſt claime to, is this, To be but his ſeruant, though thou wereſt a King: (and woe be to thee, if thou be not a ſeruant of Chriſts) Then looking vp to Chriſt, and downe to thy ſelfe, reaſon thus, Hath my Lord, who is aboue me, ſuffered many things patiently, ſhall not I, who am a ſeruant, ſuffer ſomething patiently? And then the ſoule ſhall ſay, Suffer patiently for him, and I ſhall count it honour to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of his ſuffering: for of all the honours of the world, it is the greateſt, to ſuffer for Chriſt. Were not the Apoſtles blythe while they ſuffered for Chriſt? Reade <hi>Act. 5. verſ. 41.</hi> there it is ſaid, <hi>They departed from the Councill reioycing that they were counted worthie to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer rebuke for his Name.</hi> Paul, <hi>Phillip. 1. verſ. 29.</hi> ſaith, <hi>To you is giuen for Chriſt, not onelie to belieue in him, but alſo to ſuffer for his ſake.</hi> They who ſuffer for Chriſt, may thinke they haue gotten a great gift.</p>
            <p>Farder of this argument, I marke this, The hatred and loue of men is common to Ieſus Chriſt, with his members: ſo that they who loue Ieſus Chriſt, they loue alſo his ſeruantes: and they who are foes to Chriſt, they are foes alſo to his ſeruantes. But it is well to bee marked, that this hatred and fauour of men beginneth euer at Chriſt: ere euer one loue the ſeruant, hee muſt loue the Maſter: and hee that hateth the ſeruant, hee hateth the Maſter firſt: Hateſt thou him who beareth the Meſſage of Chriſt? thou hateſt Chriſt, who ſent him, ſaye what thou wilt: and thou who loueſt Chriſt, thou wilt loue the ſillieſt member of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Nowe I come to the fourth argument, and it is from the cauſe which they had in hande: Whatſoeuer the worlde ſhould doe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, it ſhoulde bee for a good cauſe, it ſhoulde bee <hi>for my Names ſake,</hi> and for my Fathers ſake. Hee letteth the Diſciples ſee farder than the worlde ſawe in their hatred to the Diſciples: for Chriſt in all his ſpeaking, chiefelie with the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, hee letteth them ſee with whome they had to doe: they had to doe firſt with the Father of Heauen: all their perſecution was a misknowledging of the Father. The malicious perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men, ſtriketh firſt vpon the GOD of Heauen: firſt ere it bee on the Sonne, it muſt ſtrike on the Father. As the Iewes
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:16631:64"/>
then, that woulde boaſt that they loued God, and hated his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, had in their heartes firſt the hatred of the Father: ſo nowe men will ſaye in the middeſt of the hatred of the ſeruantes of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, that they loue Ieſus Chriſt: but the Spirite of Ieſus Chriſt ſayeth, They lie: and the ground of their hatred, is the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of Chriſt. Bee not deceiued: I will laye downe this as a ſure ground: It is vnpoſſible for one to loue Chriſt, or his Father, and to raile vpon the ſeruantes of Chriſt. This for the fourth argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein wee may ſee the firſt thing required in a Chriſtian, is patience. Among all the argumentes, to moue a man to patience, this ſuffering for a good cauſe, is principall: for it bringeth with it great joy. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a man ſuffereth as an euil doer, as a thiefe, an adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, or murderer, he will not ſuffer patiently &amp; joyfully. The Lord will not let joy come of ſin: but if they haue joy, that comes vpon the aſſurance their ſinnes are forgiuen them, which cauſed them to hold down their head. Bleſſed is the man who ſuffereth for a good cauſe! and the beſt cauſe, is to ſuffer for Ieſus Chriſt: and if euer one found joy in ſuffering, they found the greateſt joy: for as it is ſaid <hi>1. Pet. 4.14.</hi> of thoſe who ſuffer for Chriſt, <hi>the Spirit of glory, &amp; of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth vpon them</hi>: the Spirit of Chriſt ſits downe in the ſoule, &amp; reſteth &amp; holdeth vp the ſoule with joy. No words can teach this ſo wel as experience: the Martyrs were witneſſes herof, who in moſt exquiſit torments were patient, &amp; rejoyced wonderfully: &amp; what was the cauſe thereof? Euen becauſe that the Spirit of Chriſt filled their ſoules with joy: and that joy ouercame &amp; ate vp all the pain. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if thou wouldeſt ſuffer, look that it be for a good cauſe: let it be for the cauſe of Ieſus Chriſt, that our ſuffering may be joyfull, &amp; in laying down of this life, we may be aſſured, that we ſhal be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to that bleſſed life: <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Matth. 5.10, are thoſe who ſuffer for righteouſneſſe ſake, for theirs is the Kingdome of God.</hi> Now leſt the ignorance of the Father ſhold haue bene thought to haue bene a ſimple ignorance, he ſaith, <hi>Jf I had not come, and ſpoken vnto them,</hi> (he meaneth of the Scribes &amp; Phariſees) <hi>they ſhould haue had no ſinne</hi>: that is, If I had not reuealed the whole ſecret of the Father, their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance had bene tollerable: but now they haue no pretence to cloake their ignorance, but their mouth ſhall bee cloſed vp.</p>
            <p>Nowe yee ſee in theſe wordes, howe hee bringeth this perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of his Diſcilples to the head grounde: Firſt, There is the hatred of the Diſciples: Secondly, there is the hatred of the Sonne: And thirdlie, there is the miſſe-knowledge of the Father.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:16631:65"/>
The ground of this is the bitterneſſe of the heart. So it is called, <hi>Act. 8. verſ. 23.</hi> when Peter ſpeaketh to Simon Magus. The ground then of ignorance, was the roote of bitterneſſe in the heart, reſiſting the holy Spirit. From this maliciouſneſſe ſloweth the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of God, the hatred of the Sonne, and the hatred of the Diſciples. All perſecution commeth of malice firſt, and then of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. All the perſecuters that euer were in the world, were like as many blind men. Indeed I grant, that all perſecution will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede in alike meaſure, from malice, and the gall of bitterneſſe; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit there is none ignorance, but it is joyned with ſome malice of the heart: but the malice is not alike great: for in ſome hearts there is nothing but venome, and a bag of gall: and ſome there are who haue leſſe: and that perſecution proceedeth of a blinde zeale, more than of bitterneſſe. Looke what Paul ſpeaketh of himſelfe, <hi>1. Timoth. 1. verſ. 13.</hi> hee had ſuch a blind zeale, that hee perſecuted the Kirke: and when he was going to Damaſcus, he had a kinde of zeale: but afterwarde, when hee ſaw Chriſt, hee called that zeale a madneſſe, and woodneſſe. So there is ſome perſecution that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of a blind zeale: &amp; ſome there is, that commeth of maliciouſneſſe altogether: And as theſe two differ in grounds, ſo they differ in mercy alſo. Paul, <hi>1. Timoth. 1.</hi> ſaith, Before, I was a blaſphemer, a perſecuter, and an oppreſſour: but God had mercy on me, for I did it ignorantly, thorow vnbeliefe: and therefore the Lord laid it not to my charge. But as touching the other perſecution, that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of maliciouſneſſe againſt the holy Spirit, woe to that perſecuter: for ſurely it is a rare thing for ſuch a man to gette grace: And hee who is obdured in maliciouſneſſe, (for it is the ground of ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt,) very hardly obtaineth ſaluation, becauſe with great difficultie is it rooted out of the ſoule.</p>
            <p>Take heed, there is none of vs, but there is a piece of venome in vs, and wee ſpoute out venome. So wee knowing that God deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that venome, wee ſhould trauell to gette it away by prayer to God, as we feele it: for there is no power in Heauen, nor in earth, that can purge vs, but that holy Spirit: and he who hath this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of Chriſt, when hee feeleth this bitterneſſe in the heart, will loathe at it, and then he will haue his refuge to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Take vp, in this laſt verſe, that Chriſt and his Goſpel ſerueth to make the world inexcuſable: for their ignorance is wilfull. There is neuer a ſoule that is condemned, or goeth to Hell, that can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende ignorance, becauſe their ignorance is voluntary. It is true,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:16631:65"/>
that ere euer a man goe to Hell, he is blinded, and the eyes of him are taken away by his owne corruption: But it is alſo true, that ere euer a man die, his mouth ſhall bee cloſed, and hee ſhall not haue a worde to ſpeake in the daye of judgement: No damned ſoule ſhall haue a word to ſpeake in that day: when that voyce is pronounced againſt them, they ſhall paſſe awaye, with the greateſt ſhout that euer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was, becauſe they dare not pretende ignorance: for his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance ſhall bee inexcuſable. Any man would thinke, that if any were excuſed for ignorance, that the Gentiles would be excuſed: yet the Apoſtle ſaieth, <hi>Rom. 1. verſ. 21.</hi> There is not a Gentile that died, but their conſcience ſhall make them inexcuſable: becauſe of the light of nature that they had into them: Looke then to the ſharpneſſe of the judgement of God: And if thou hadſt no more but the light of nature, all theſe creatures ſhall ſtande vp againſt thee, &amp; condemne thee, though there were no more to condemne thee. If that light of nature make men inexcuſable in that great day, let vs take heed how we heare the Scriptures: for if the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles were inexcuſable, what ſhall bee the eſtate of the people, who haue not onely the light of nature, but that ſpirituall light from Heauen, reuealed by the mouth of Ieſus Chriſt? Shall that ſoule ſpeake a word in that day? Therefore I beſeech you, in the bowels of Ieſus Chriſt, to receiue knowledge, or elſe it were better for vs, that wee had neuer heard of Chriſt: and better ſhall it be with the Gentiles, and with Sodome and Gomorrha, than with vs: the greater light, the greater condemnation: Therefore, as wee would ſee Heauen, let this light ſhine in our heartes, that wee may bee transformed from the courſe of the world, and ſhine before Chriſt in newneſſe of life.</p>
            <p>Nowe in the next wordes, hee giueth the ſeconde argument of that hatred, and aggreageth it more: <hi>They who hate mee, hate the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo.</hi> And he is ſpeaking of the obſtinate Iewes, who pretended a loue to God. We heard heretofore, that the hatred of the world againſt the Diſciples of Chriſt, was againſt Chriſt himſelfe: the hatred that extended to the one part, extended alſo to the other. Now we heare that the hatred of the world againſt Chriſt, exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the Father alſo: and that hee who hateth Chriſt, hateth God alſo: And euen as the Iewes hated the Diſciples, becauſe they ſawe ſome grace of Chriſt in them, and becauſe they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with his Spirite: (for the worlde will neuer hate one that is his owne:) ſo for that ſame cauſe, hateth the world Chriſts mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers:
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:16631:66"/>
yea, the hatred of the world againſt Chriſt himſelfe, was for none other cauſe, but becauſe they ſaw God dwelling in him bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: they ſaw that glorious Godhead dwelling in the nature of man: howbeit they caſt vp his kinred to him, yet they hated him not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the fleſhe, but becauſe God dwelt in him. The thing that the men of this world hate moſt, is the God of Heauen: &amp; if they hate any creature of God, it is for Gods cauſe. It is a wonderfull thing, that ſuch a thought can be in the hart of the creature againſt the Creator. Let vs then ſee the cauſe! <hi>God is light,</hi> ſaith Iohn, <hi>1. epiſt. 1. verſ. 5.</hi> And whatſoeuer man in the world doth wickedly, he hateth the light deadly, yea, if it were but the day light, and the light of the Sun, hee hateth it, becauſe it craueth a decent behauiour. <hi>Rom. 13. verſ. 13.</hi> And the wicked ſoule craueth aye filthineſſe: and much more they hate the light of the worde of God, becauſe it pierceth into the conſciences of men, it ſtingeth them: and then moſt of all they hate God himſelfe, who is the light: when hee beginneth to ſhine vpon their conſciences, they find ſuch an horror &amp; dread our, that they would wiſhe him out of the worlde, ſo vehementlie they hate him: they can abide to ſee the Deuil, or any creature; but they cannot abide the ſight of God. Now looke our nature: darknes &amp; light ſight not ſo much, heat &amp; cold fight not ſo much together, as God and our nature: and this battell ſhall neuer haue an ende; no, not when the miſerable catiue is in Hell. Whereon riſeth Hell, but vpon the diſſention betwixt the Creator, and the creature? So this battell ſhall neuer take an ende, except it pleaſe God of his grace, who made light to ſhine out of darkneſſe, to inlighten, and to reforme the ſoule, and to ſcatter this palpable darkneſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in wee are wrapped.</p>
            <p>I goe forwarde to the thirde argument, <hi>If I had not wrought ſuch works among them, which none other man in this world did, they wold not haue had ſinne.</hi> The argument then is taken from his workes: They ſawe Ieſus Chriſt to bee ſuch a man, as there was neuer the like of him. They ſawe that diuinitie in him: and this ſight aggreageth their hatred. By the workes, I vnderſtand all the prooues the Lord gaue of his Diuinitie to the worlde; whether they were the miraculous workes, in reſtoring the blinde to ſight, the lame to limmes, the deafe to eares; or it was his holy life in the worlde. Neuer man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſo holily, and heauenly, as he: for he ſaith, <hi>Iohn, 5. verſ. 36. My works teſtifie of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I am not a man only.</hi> And indeede, not only thoſe who were his friendes, and his Diſciples, and ſeruantes, tooke this
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:16631:66"/>
vp: (Iohn ſaith, <hi>We ſaw him full of grace and veritie, and wee ſaw his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like the glorie of the onely begotten Sonne of God, John, 1. verſ. 14.</hi>) but alſo his very enemies ſaw it: when as the ſouldiours came to take him, they ſaid, <hi>Neuer one ſpake, as he ſpeaketh, John, 7. verſ. 46.</hi> His words bound the mens hands: and the Phariſees, who were his enemies, were compelled to ſay, <hi>If he had beene a ſinner, he could not haue healed the blind, John, 9. verſ. 16.</hi> And ſo we who now liue, howbeit we ſee him not bodily, working wonders in the world, thereby to perſwade, or to conuince vs; yet by this worde of the Croſſe preached, which to his owne is the power and wiſdome of God, we are perſwaded that Chriſt is the only Sonne of God, there is ſuch a Majeſty in it: And ſo, if there were no more to teſtifie vnto vs, but this word of the Goſpel, it conuinceth the conſciences of all men, that the Lord, of whom it is ſpoken, is not man only, but God alſo.</p>
            <p>Then hee ſaieth, <hi>They haue both ſeene, and haue hated both mee, and my Father.</hi> There is a maruell, that they knowing God, they hated God: it would ſeeme tollerable, if they knewe not God, to hate him: but to know him, and hate him, it is a thing not to bee comporteth with. It was ſaide of before, that the worlde, who hated him, knewe not the Father. Howe can theſe two ſtand? They ſtand both well: for firſt of all, there is a certaine knowledge of God, by the which the moſt wicked in the worlde knoweth God: but then the canker of the heart expelleth this knowledge: and on this commeth ignorance, and on ignorance commeth hatred. Marke by what degrees ſinne riſeth vp: and euery one of vs may finde this in ſome meaſure: there is no ſinner, who doeth a great ſinne, but firſt they haue a knowledge of God, of good and of euill. Paul, <hi>Rom. 1. verſ. 21.</hi> ſpeaking of the Gentiles, ſaieth, they knew God. There is ſuch a bitterneſſe and maliciouſneſſe in the heart, that that mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſſe blotteth out the knowledge in the heart. A wicked man will ſtoppe both his fingers in his eyes, that he ſhould not ſee. The Apoſtle afterward ſays, <hi>They not taking pleaſure to intertain the knowledge of God, they put out knowledge</hi>: knowledge departed, blacke ignorance co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth in, by the judgement of God; &amp; then farewell conſcience: then they loſe all feeling: and being blind, and paſt ſenſe, they run headlonges to all miſchiefe: And that is it the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Epheſ. 4.19.</hi> So yee ſee, that all this miſchiefe that men committeth in the world, falleth out immediatly of blindnes: ere euer one go to doe wickednes, ignorance co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth in firſt: &amp; then commeth in a want of conſcience. Durſt a man goe out ſo boldly before God,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:16631:67"/>
to doe wickedneſſe, if hee had a conſcience? And thinke yee that wicked men in this Countrey, who take paſtime in murder, in fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, &amp;c. and aboue all, thoſe men who haue committed ſuch hainous things againſt God, againſt Religion, againſt their owne natiue Countreye, and the Crowne; thinke yee they woulde haue ſuch a boldneſſe, if they ſtopped not their fingers in their eyes, and blunted the conſcience? I pronounce, in the Name of God, they are bound in the chaines of darneſſe, (looſe them who will,) if they repent not.</p>
            <p>The laſt thing I mark: what is the thing that maketh all ſinne inexcuſable? Knowledge cloſeth the mouth of the ſinner: know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge taketh away all excuſes: it taketh awaye ignorance, and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance ſhall excuſe no man in the daye of the Lord: and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the knowledge bee, the leſſe excuſe is there for ſinne. I ſaye more: Knowledge not onely maketh ſinne inexcuſable, but know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge doubleth ſinne: Murder is ſinne, but murder with knowledge is double ſinne: and the greater the knowledge is, the greater the ſinne ſhall bee, in the daye of Iudgement. And if thou hadſt but the knowledge of the elements, thou ſhalt be inexcuſable: And if the Lord ſpeake out of Heauen to thee, thy ſinne ſhall bee tripled: and well were it with thee, who nowe ſinneſt vnder the light of the Goſpel, without repentance, that thou hadſt bene one of Sodome, in that great day: and thou thy ſelfe ſhalt wiſh in that daye, that ſo it had beene. There is no tongue can tell the judgement that ſhall fall vpon that man, who heareth this worde, and abideth in ſinne. Yet the worlde will not bee wakened: Crie on them, they are not the better. Thus much for the ſecond argument.</p>
            <p>In the verſe following, leſt it ſhoulde bee thought or objected, that the obſtinate Iewes ſhould haue done this in deſpite of God, the Lord meeteth this, &amp; ſaith, <hi>All this is done that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their Lawe, They hated mee without a cause.</hi> The place is in the <hi>35. Pſalme, verſ. 19.</hi> It is called the Lawe, becauſe all Prophecie is a pendicle to Moyſes Lawe; and all the Prophets were vnder the Law. This is a complaint of Dauid, of his enemies, who hated him without a cauſe. There was a great cauſe of loue in Chriſt, and not of hatred. Then this yee will ſee commonly, that when the Spirit in the Scripture maketh mention of croſſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and perſecution of Chriſt, which are euill things, he ſpeaketh ſo warily of them, that nothing bee derogate to Gods glorie, hee ſaith, The Lord ordained them from all eternitie. And there is not
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:16631:67"/>
a thing, yea, not the moſte vnworthie thing, that is done to the faythfull of Chriſt this daye, but it commeth by that eternall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree: it was preordained: and if it had not beene ſo, the godly had cauſe to ſorrowe, and the God of Heauen woulde bee diſgraced. And marke this, that the ordinance of God ſhall not excuſe thee, who is the inſtrument, when thou doeſt anie thing againſt his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed will. The Murderer may ſaye, What haue I done, but the will of God? O murderer! ſay I, thou art not to bee excuſed: thou haſt not done the will of God reuealed: and ſo ſay I to the Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, and to all others, that commit ſinnes, which God hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden. After that he hath aggreaged this hatred of the Iewes, againſt his Diſciples, he leaueth it, and returneth to his Diſciples, to comfort them. The laſt thing hee comforteth them with, <hi>Hee ſhall ſende them that Comforter from the Father</hi>: for hee commeth firſt from the Father: and the Father ſendeth him by the Sonne: he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth him <hi>the Spirit of trueth</hi>: and, <hi>He ſhall teſtifie</hi> into your heart <hi>of mee.</hi> As if hee would ſaye, The teſtimony theſe Iewes got, it was but outwardly: but to you I ſhall ſende my Spirit, an inward witneſſe. The Leſſon is: Wee ſee heere two ſortes of witneſſes: the one out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, the other inwarde: to wit, the Spirit. The firſt is his word, his miracles: and it is good to heare the worde: but and if the Spirite bee not preſent, it were better for thee neuer to haue heard the worde. And ſuppoſing wee had CHRIST with vs, euen in the middeſt of vs, as hee was amongſt the Iewes, if it pleaſed him not to ſende his Spirite into our heartes, it woulde doe vs no good. And therefore, thinke it not enough to ſaye, And if wee had CHRIST, as the Iewes had him, wee woulde belieue, and wee woulde bee well. No, no, If thou hadſt not the Spirite, all woulde not auaile thee. Bee not content to bee hearers onelie, for all that will ſerue but to da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nation, except thou feeleſt that Comforter to worke in thine heart, to reforme thine heart, and to worke fayth into thee. And therefore let this bee thy prayer, in hearing that worde, LORD, let thy Spirit worke into mine heart. And if hee bee into thine heart, hee will let thee feele ſuch a comfort, and ſuch a peace, and ſuch a reſt into thine heart, that the worlde cannot tell what it meaneth.</p>
            <p>This is to be conſidered, that he ſaith, he <hi>will ſend the Comforter to them from the Father</hi>: for it importeth, That the Spirit floweth firſt from the Father, &amp; then from himſelfe. So he ſaid in the Chapter preceeding, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>the Father ſhould ſende the Spirit in his Name</hi>: for the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:16631:68"/>
Father ſendeth the Spirit by the Sonne, ere the Sonne ſende him from the Father. Seeing then, he proceedeth from them both, he muſt beare witneſſe both of the Father, and of the Sonne: but of the Father, by the Sonne, in whom the Father manifeſteth himſelf viſibly.</p>
            <p>Thereafter he comforteth them another way, for he ſayth, <hi>Yee ſhall alſo witneſſe of mee.</hi> So he honoureth them, to make them wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe-bearers to him. The greateſt honour in the world, when a man is ſent to beare witneſſe to Chriſt: howbeit thou ſhouldeſt die into the meſſage, thou haſt gotten an honour aboue all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours. It is true, this cauſe wherefore they bare witneſſe of him, was becauſe they ſaw him, and heard him, and handled him with their handes: and this was a great helpe. But take vp heere the chiefe ground, in bearing witneſſe of Chriſt, when he ſendeth into the heart, the Spirit of comfort: And I ſay, ſuppoſe neuer a man ſaw Chriſt, (as we this day ſee him not bodily,) or neuer handled him, yet if it pleaſe the Lord, to ſende that Spirit into the heart, he will demonſtrate Chriſt vnto him, as euidently, as though he had beene in Heauen to ſee that grace. Not onelie Miniſters muſt doe this, but all men muſt confeſſe Chriſt: and ſo let vs preaſſe to gette that Spirit: for as Paul ſayde, No man is able to name the Lord, without that Spirit. <hi>1. Corinth. Chap. 12. verſ. 3.</hi> At the Name of IESVS all knees ſhould bee bowed, and the tongue ſhoulde bee looſed, with ſuch a grace of the heart, that the heartes of men who heare, ſhould bee edified at the hearing of the worde: And wee ſhoulde aye bee edified more and more, till in the ende wee growe to perfection in Chriſt: To whome, with the Father, and the Holie Spirite, bee all prayſe, honour, glorie, power, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, for euermore.</p>

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:16631:69"/>
things they ſhould do after he was departed. Now in the ſixteenth Chapter he continueth in the ſame purpoſe. In the beginning of the Chapter he concludeth that doctrine which he had in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the former Chapter, that exhortation he gaue his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to patience, <hi>Theſe things haue J ſpoken vnto you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ye ſhould not be offended</hi>: that is, I haue ſpoken to you of the hatred of the world, and of the perſecution of the worlde for my cauſe, that yee ſhould not be offended at mee, and at my Croſſe. The Leſſon is, Brethren, Chriſt Ieſus, and the Croſſe, are things vnſeparable. Affliction fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth vpon the Euangel: <hi>1. Timoth. Chap. 1. verſ. 8.</hi> they are called the afflictions of the Euangel: Bee not aſhamed of the afflictions of the Euangel. Now the thing in the worlde that nature abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and can abide worſt, is the Croſſe: So if wee will looke to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, there is no acceſſe to Chriſt: It is vnpoſsible for vs, by nature to attaine to Chriſt, except by an heauenly power we be ſuſtained, that we may paſſe thorow the ſire of the Croſſe, wherewith hee is compaſſed. The Lord Ieſus is in a fire, and without: we paſſe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row this fire, wee cannot bee partakers of Chriſt: and ere wee goe thorow the fire, we muſt be raiſed vp by an heauenly grace: for as fayth to belieue in Chriſt, is of grace; ſo affliction and ſuffering for Chriſt, is of grace. <hi>Philipp. Chap. 1. verſ. 29. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you it is giuen for Chriſt, that not onelie yee ſhould belieue in him, but alſo to ſuffer for his ſake.</hi> Except a man be holden vp, he is not able to abide the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Euangel.</p>
            <p>Well then, in the time of calmneſſe, and while the Lord, giu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yea, euery one, who profeſſeth the Lord, and his Goſpel, ſhould bee ready, when it pleaſeth the Lord to lay on the burden. And chiefly this appertaineth to Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, ay to fore-warne, that affliction is to come: that at that day of affliction, men &amp; women may be ready to ſuffer what the Lord will lay on them: for as it is ſaid, <hi>Hee who is fore-warned, is halfe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi>: And thou ſhouldeſt ſay euery day, Lord, as I profeſſe thy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, ſo I am ready to ſuffer for it: knowing, that the ende of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is joy.</p>
            <p>When he hath concluded the ſpeach he hath had with them ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, he commeth in particularly, and fore-telleth of ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions which they ſhould ſuffer: The firſt is, <hi>They ſhall excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate you</hi>; The ſecond, <hi>The time ſhall come, when they ſhall ſlay you: and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:16631:69"/>
they ſhall thinke they ſerue God.</hi> Hee layeth downe the ground, <hi>Becauſe they know not the Father, nor me.</hi> The Text is eaſie: It is not one or two ſorts of afflictions only, that is joyned with Chriſt, &amp; his Goſpel: but all kinde of affliction, and at laſt it will come to death it ſelfe: and what reck of a common death? but death with exquiſite tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Reade the Bookes of the Martyres: the Apoſtles had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of this, they paſſed forwarde, after Chriſt went away, from affliction to affliction; till at laſt they loſt their liues: they were ſcourged, &amp; ſhot out of the Synagogue, &amp; at laſt ſlain: the afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that follow on the Goſpel, are all kind of afflictions. So if any man would ſuffer, let him prepare himſelfe to ſuffer, though it were all the torments of the world. Look what the Lord ſpake to <hi>Peter, Ioh. 21.18. When thou waſt a young man, thou girdedſt thy ſelf, &amp; walkedſt whither thou wouldeſt: but when thou ſhalt be old, thou ſhalt ſtretch foorth thine hands, and another ſhall gird thee, and leade thee whither thou wouldeſt not</hi>: That is, thy ſuffering ſhalbe in the will of thine enemies.

The faireſt cloake to doe a wicked turne, is the cloake of Religion: and ſo the foreſt crueltie, is vnder the cloake of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. There was neuer ſuch a crueltie as the Papiſtes vſe, vnder the pretence of Religion: Inquire about that holy houſe of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and that Maſſacre of <hi>Paris,</hi> which ſhall neuer bee forgotten before God: that blood of the Sainctes is crying for vengeance from the Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: all the pretences they can make, ſhall not ſaue them from it. Nowe, marke the ground of their perſecution: <hi>Theſe thinges they ſhall doe to you, becauſe they knew not the Father, nor mee.</hi> The ground of all well-doing is light, when the eye of the ſoule is illuminate to ſee GOD, and IESVS CHRIST, and the Father in the face of the Lord Ieſus: when the mind is illuminat, then the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is vpright: &amp; when the judgement is vpright, the hart &amp; the affections are wel inclined: when the hart is well inclined, then the

hand, and the outward inſtrumentes, are well occupied. <hi>Matth. 6. verſ. 22. Jf the eye ſee, the whole body is lightened</hi>: that is, if the eye of the ſoule be lightened, then the ſoule is wel diſpoſed: So when the mind is ſet vpon Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; lightned by that light, it is a joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing: but if the mind, which is the eye of the ſoule, bee blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and ſee not the face of Ieſus Chriſt, then all the powers of the ſoule are blinded: the judgement is blind, &amp; the hart is euill diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the affections peruerſe, &amp; then the hand is doing euill: a blind body is ay doing euil: if the eye be blind, the whole body is blind: if the light bee put out, then there is great darkneſſe: if the eye of the ſoule bee put out, then a man is but a lumpe of darkneſſe, and nothing abideth that creature, but that outward darkneſſe.

Therefore, as thou wouldeſt haue an vpright iudgement, ſtriue to haue an il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminate ſoule: and as thou wouldeſt doe well, keepe aye a cleare eye in thy ſoule. Neuer let the face of Ieſus depart from thine eye: for it is onely that face that holdeth the eye in a clearneſſe, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth light to the ſoule: He is the light of the world, and take him away, there is nothing but darkneſſe in the world. When he hath fore-warned them of the afflictions, he ſets downe the end, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he fore-warneth them, to wit, that they ſhould remember the Lord had fore-warned them of afflictions, &amp; therefore, that they ſhould prepare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues for trouble. But wheras they might haue ſaid, Wherfore forewarned thou vs no ſooner? he anſwers to this, I fore-warned you not of this from the beginning, becauſe I was with you: but now I am to depart, &amp; therfore I forewarn you. One of the beſt preparations wee can haue, is to heare much, (for this preaching will not abide ay) therefore let vs heare well ſo long as we haue occaſion of hearing of the word which we preach to you: for why? in the day of affliction, that holy Spirit ſhall call to thy rememberance that which thou haſt heard, and ſo comfort thee: And in the day of affliction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the holy Spirit will be more effectuall to call to thy rememberance that which thou haſt hearde, better than when thou firſt heardeſt it: For why? the worde of God, and the Spirit of God, hath not the ſpeciall effect euer when the word is heard, but when the body is in moſt neceſsity: and of all times in the worlde, in the time of affliction, or in the houre of death, the word will be moſt ſweete. Therefore heare in time, if it were in the houre of death: that at leaſt, in the hour of death, thou mayſt haue ioy in thine hearr.

his Diſciples in this world: certainly ſo long as hee was with them, he loued them wondrous tenderly: and let be that he would not let them ſuffer, he wold not once let them heare of the croſſe. And this is the thing, that the Diſciples of Iohn the Baptiſt come to Chriſt, and complaine of, <hi>Mat. 9. verſ. 14.</hi> ſaying, <hi>Why do we, and the Phariſees <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The ground of this is, becauſe the Diſciples of Chriſt had a time of grouth gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them into the worlde: and ſo long as the Lord abode into the worlde, they were not ripe, and their ſtrength was more out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde than inwarde: But now, when hee goeth away, they growe ripe: he ſent his Spirit vpon them, as ye ſee, <hi>Act.

So wee haue our owne time in growing: and the Lord, when hee ſeeth wee are not able to ſuffer, hee will not lay the Croſſe vpon vs, but hee will ſpa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nowe as for vs, wee haue had a long time to ripen, and it is a wonder that the Lord hath giuen vs ſo long a time, and ſpared vs ſo long. But, Brethren, the time is comming, wherein wee ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and afflictions abide vs for the Goſpel: And I praye the Lord, that hee may finde ſome ripeneſſe and maturity, and chiefely in vs the Miniſters of the Goſpel, that we may ſeale vp the Goſpel with our blood, if need require. He falleth out in the <hi>verſ.</hi> following, in a gentle reproofe of his Apoſtles, I am to depart, and none of you asketh, where I am to goe: but, ſaith hee, <hi>your heartes are full of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe.</hi> The Diſciples of Chriſt, when hee was among them, ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſced vpon his bodily preſence, and thought they had ſuch an eaſe with him, that they thought not of any other felicity: and therefore they were woe at ſuch ſpeaches: for they were more car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, than ſpirituall; and tooke more heede to that carnall, than ſpirituall ioy. So this is our nature, that if we can get in the world ſuch aboundance of riches, pleaſure, honour, and ſuch companie as we would, we would neuer deſire to goe out of this world, but ay to remaine. And when wee heare tell that wee muſt ſlit out of this

worlde, the rememberance of death will ſting vs to the heart: the Diſciples were ſad, becauſe the Lord was to goe from them: It is the hardeſt thing in the worlde, to gette the ſoule diſſeuered from the world, and to get the eye ſet vpon Heauen, and to get an hope of that Life: Woe to that ſoule that getteth not hope to reach aboue this worlde: that ſoule is in an euill eſtate: And the Lord knowing this, hee will take awaye from vs, that companie that will drawe vs from him, and piece and piece hee will take vs vnto himſelfe: for no man getteth the deſire of Heauen in a moment: but a man piece and piece ſtealeth out of the worlde, and goeth to Heauen. Thinke not thou, therefore, them happie, who haue the worlde at their will: No, no, it is well for that creature, whom the Lord draweth out of the worlde, by taking from them the thinges of the worlde: For miſerable are wee, if ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:16631:71"/>
that the tongue of him who findeth that joye, is not able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the thouſand part of it. Both theſe preſences are very good: and they who ſaw him, had a great benefit. Many Kings longed to ſee him, but they ſaw him not: as Dauid, and Abraham. The men who ſaw him when hee was an Infant, thought they gotte a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter grace, than if all the worlde had beene giuen them. But for all this, the other preſence is better: for hee ſaieth, <hi>Jt is good that I goe away from you.</hi> It had beene good for the Iewes, that they had neuer had his bodily preſence, becauſe they had not the ſpirituall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord in their hearts. But as for that ſpiritual preſence, in all reſpectes it is to bee preferred to his bodily preſence, in the dayes of his humiliation: becauſe by vertue of that preſence, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit ſo farre diſtant from vs,) wee receiue the holy Spirite, and all his graces. Looke to Heauen, and ſee him glorified: that preſence is the chiefe preſence: and as ſoone as wee ſee that glory, in that day, the beames of his glory ſhall transforme vs, and catch vs vp in the clouds. So great is the glory of the Lord, that it will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine within the Heauens with our Head: but of neceſſity it muſt flowe to his members vpon earth. Nowe when thou findeſt grace, and joye, and pleaſure into thine heart, (And thinke not thou haſt joy enough, howbeit thou hadſt all the pleaſures in the world, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thou haue that joye of Chriſt.) then aſſure thy ſelfe, that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt thine Head is glorified in the Heauens. And if wee finde ſuch a pleaſure, that wee will bee rauiſhed aboue the worlde, being now ſo farre diſtant from Chriſt; what ſhall bee that joy and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure wee ſhall conceiue in our heart, when wee ſhall ſee him face to face? The tongue cannot tell it: but the heart that hath felt it, can beſt teſtifie it. The Lord grant, that while as wee are in the earth, wee may walke as Citizens in the Heauens, euer waiting that theſe vile bodies may bee transformed, and made conformable to that glorious body of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now to goe forward: After he hath fore-warned his Diſciples of the afflictions which after his departure they ſhold ſuffer, That they ſhould bee excommunicate, and alſo ſlaine: And after hee hath ſet downe the ende wherefore hee fore-warned them, to wit, that they ſhould not be offended, but confirmed: And after he hath reproued them gently, that they rejoyced not when he tolde them that he was to depart: And after he hath begun to comfort them, by letting the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:16631:72"/>
partakers of the holy Spirit, and his graces: which, if hee did not aſcend to his Father, they would not get: In the words following he falleth out vpon another head of doctrine, &amp; inſtructeth them concerning the office of the Spirite, which hee was to diſcharge in the worlde, during the time of his abſence: and this office is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the world, and chiefely of the obſtinate Iewes, who would not belieue in Chriſt when hee was preſent with them: <hi>When hee ſhall come,</hi> that is, when that Spirite of trueth ſhall come, after that I am gone away, he ſhall rebuke the world: that is, the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and obſtinate in the worlde, hee ſhall conuict them. But yee may ſaye, No man heareth the voyce of the Spirite, ſpeaking with his owne mouth: howe ſhall the Spirite then rebuke the worlde? The meaning is, The Diſciples, whome that Spirite ſhall comfort, ſhall by their Miniſterie rebuke the worlde. Wee haue then two effectes of the Spirite heere: The firſt is, in reſpect of the godlie, and thoſe who belieue in Ieſus Chriſt, the Spirite entereth into their heartes, and worketh the greateſt joye and conſolation that euer was. There was neuer a ſoule that knewe what true joye meaned, but thoſe that felt the Spirite. The other effect, is in reſpect of thoſe who abide rebellious againſt Chriſt. In reſpect of them, the holy Spirite is aye rebuking and threatning them to their damnation: and that, by the Miniſterie of poore men: for hee will ſet them vp, and make them ſtand vp, and rebuke all the obſtinate: yea, euen the Kinges of the earth, if they will not belieue. All theſe reproofes that come out of the mouthes of the ſeruauntes of IESVS CHRIST, howe ſimple ſoeuer they bee, they proceede not ſo much from the mouthes of men, as from the holie Spirite: and they contemne the holie Spirit, who contemne thoſe men, his Miniſters: and the Lord of Heauen will bee auenged on them in that great Daye.</p>
            <p>But to come to the particulars: Hee ſhall rebuke the worlde, and conuict it of three thinges: The firſt is, <hi>Hee ſhall conuict the worlde of ſinne</hi>: Next, <hi>Of righteouſneſſe</hi>: And thirdlie, <hi>Of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> The firſt of theſe three concerneth the faythleſſe vvorlde: and the other two concerne the Lord Ieſus: Hee ſhall conuict the world, that the Lord Ieſus is not only holy and righteous, but alſo the great and glorious Iudge of the world. Firſt he ſaith, <hi>The holy Spirit, when hee ſhall come, hee ſhall conuict the world of ſinne.</hi> Then hee ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth the ground, <hi>Becauſe the world belieueth not in me.</hi> The ſinne is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelitie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in that they belieue not in Ieſus Chriſt, the heauieſt ſinne
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:16631:72"/>
that can fall vpon any man, for it bringeth on the greateſt guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and condemnation that euer was: <hi>Hee who belieueth not in mee,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>he is condemned already. Iohn, 3. verſ. 18.</hi> Looke how ſoone thou ſinneſt, if thou refuſe to turne thine heart to the Lord Ieſus; as ſoone thou art condemned: the Lord delayeth not the ſentence to the laſt daye: but when thou haſt ſinned, the Lord immediately aſcendeth as a Iudge, to his Tribunall, and giueth out the ſentence of wrath againſt thee, becauſe thou belieueſt not in the onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Sonne of God. So there is no greater ſinne, than infidelity, for where it is, all ſinnes are imputed: as by the contrary, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt righteouſneſſe that any man in this world can haue, is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue in Chriſt: it is ſuch a righteouſnes that taketh away all the ſin whatſoeuer: where it is, no ſinne is imputed. Art thou a Murderer, a Blaſphemer, an Adulderer? &amp;c. belieue in Chriſt, that he died for thee, and thy ſins ſhal not be laid to thy charge: for the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Chriſt cloatheth a guilty man with righteouſnes. And this moued a notable ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God to ſay, <hi>There is no ſin without infidelity: &amp; no righteouſnes without faith</hi>: Meaning, that of al the ſins in the world the ſin of infidelity is the greateſt: for if thou belieue not, the leaſt euil thought that thou canſt think, ſhal abide before God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: ſo long as infidelity abideth, all ſin abideth: &amp; take it away, all thy ſins ſhallbe taken away. This is then the meaning: &amp; would ye haue proofe of this, how the holy Spirit ſhal reproue the world of ſin, look <hi>Paul, 1. Cor. 14.24.</hi> there ye will find the experience hereof, for hee ſaieth, <hi>Jf a man propheſie conforme to the worde, if an idiote com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in at the doore, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> an vnlearned man that belieueth not, hee is rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of all, and is judged of all: and ſo are the ſecretes of his heart made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt</hi>: (to wit, that infidelitie that laye in his heart, is made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt,) <hi>and then hee falleth downe on his face, and worſhippeth GOD: and ſayeth plainlie,, GOD is in you indeede.</hi> We haue the experience of this in our own ſelues: when Ieſus Chriſt is preached, there are none that heare, and are guiltie, but their heartes are conuicted: there is none of you but ye find this: for if thou be an harlot, when thou heareſt harlotry preached, thou art conuicted, except thou be conuerted by the holy Spirit, and canſt come to God, and ſay, Lord, for Chriſtes ſake, haue mercy on mee: for that perſon that doeth ſo, is not onelie vnconuicted, but alſo is comforted by the Spirite: And happie is that ſoule which findeth this wrought into it. Nowe, What is the next thing when the Spirite ſhall come, whereof he ſhall conuict the world, and vnbelieuing Iewes?
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:16631:73"/>
               <hi>Hee ſhall conuict the world,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>of juſtice</hi>: that is, He ſhall conuict the worlde, and the vnbelieuing Iewes, That the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus was that holy One: for the Iewes counted him the moſt vnjuſt man that was in the world: they put him in the ranke of thieues: they preferred Barabbas to him. But the Spirit of God, when hee ſhall come, hee ſhall conuince the worlde, That hee was the holieſt man in the world, as hee is called, <hi>Act. 7. verſ. 52.</hi> The ground of the conuiction is this, <hi>Hee paſſed vp to the Father.</hi> It appeared that he was the juſteſt man in the worlde, ſeeing hee paſſed vp to Heauen, after his glorious reſurrection: For if he had bene a ſinner, hee had neuer ent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed into that Heauenly Sanctuary. No vnholy thing can enter into Heauen: if a man haue but ſo much as one ſpot of ſinne, he cannot come there. So then, there was neuer ſoule that gotte entry into Heauen, that got acceſſe to the Majeſty of God, but the Lord Ieſus firſt: And then, ſo many as ſhall bee waſhen from their ſinnes, by faith in his blood: ſo many onely ſhall enter into that Sanctuarie, as ſhall bee clad with the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt. If thou wouldeſt goe to Heauen, ſtriue to bee clad with that gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: that is, Haue faith, or elſe thou ſhalt neuer haue entreſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heauen.</p>
            <p>The proofe of this, That the Lord was the holieſt man in the world, appeared ſoone after Chriſt aſcended: An example yee haue in the ſecond Chapter of the Acts of the Apoſtles, <hi>verſ. 23.</hi> where Peter, or rather the Spirit of God, by the mouth of Peter, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after Chriſtes aſcention, objecteth to the Iewes, that him whome they had ſlaine with wicked handes, the Lord had raiſed him from the dead, and glorified him in the Heauens: Whereby the holy Spirite ſo conuicted, and pricked their heartes; that they ſaide to Peter, and the reſt, <hi>Men and Brethren, what ſhall wee doe?</hi> That is, How ſhall we be cleanſed from that innocent blood? So nowe it appeareth, that Chriſt was the juſteſt man that euer liued in the worlde, thorowe the working of the Spirit, that conuicteth them thereof.</p>
            <p>The thirde point, whereof the holy Spirite ſhall reprooue the world, is, <hi>of judgement.</hi> So, as the Lord is juſt, ſo is hee the glorious Iudge of the worlde. On what ground ſhall this paſſe? <hi>Becauſe the prince of this worlde is judged.</hi> The LORD IESVS is the Iudge of the worlde, in that hee hath condemned the Deuill: hee hath not judged the ſillieſt, and the weakeſt in the world: but him who had the greateſt power in the world: And ſo in judging him,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:16631:73"/>
the holy Spirit conuicteth the worlde, That hee was the Iudge of the worlde. <hi>Colloſſ. 2. verſ. 15.</hi> it is ſaide, When hee hung vpon the Croſſe, he ſate moſt gloriouſly in a Chariot. There was neuer an Emperour, who was carried in ſuch a glorious Chariot as the Lord, howbeit hee was abject in the ſight of the worlde: In that Chariot hee taketh the Deuils, and taketh all their power, and leadeth them in triumph, and maketh an open ſhowe of them. So there is his victory, which hee gotte ouer the Deuill, the prince of this world. Indeede I grant, that the Deuill as yet hath a great power in this worlde. <hi>Epheſ. Chap. 2. verſ. 2.</hi> And hee runneth about like a roaring Lion: yet he is ouercome, and chained in darkneſſe. <hi>Iud. 6.</hi> That is, Hee is in chaines of terrible horrour and anguiſh: howbeit hee will deceiue men women, and make them to thinke, that he is free to doe what he will: be lies, he is in a great horror. Now the godly, who find the mortification of that ſinfull nature, find that the Deuil is ouercome: for except the Deuill were ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, ſinne would reigne in the worlde, for the kingdome, and tyranny of the Deuill; and the kingdome of ſinne and death, are euer conjoyned. So the godly, who find that the old man is cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, finde that the Deuill is ouercome. The vngodly alſo, in whom the Deuill, the prince of this world, reigneth, (<hi>2. Corint. 4. verſ. 4.</hi>) they are conuicted in their conſciences, That the Lord hath ouercome the Deuill. The Murderers, Blaſphemers, Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, &amp;c. are conuict by the light of the Goſpel, That Sathan, whom they ſerue, as as many ſlaues, is but a ſlaue himſelfe, vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by Chriſt Ieſus, and bound with chains of darkneſſe: albeit thorowe induration, and malice of their heartes, they prefer his bondage to the liberty of the Kingdome of Chriſt.

As before hee ſaid, <hi>I will not leaue you comfortleſſe</hi>; as ſoone as he went to Heauen, he ſent downe his Spirit, by whom hee reigneth in the worlde. Nowe that Spirit is either conuerting the ſoules of men, to Chriſt; or elſe he is conuicting and condemming the obſtinate: And bee thou aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that if the holy Spirit conuert not thy ſoule by this worde, hee ſhall conuict thee, and ſtoppe thy mouth, and keepe thee in chaines, to that great Iudge the Lord Ieſus: and thou ſhalt bee ſo

Thoſe who will not bee conuerted, but remaine diſobedient, I ſhall cauſe vengeance light vpon them, and I ſhall bee the ſauour of death vnto death to them.</hi> So either ſhalt thou bee conuerted by the worde, or elſe bee conuicted, and condemned. Now when he hath dipped into this doctrine, hee cutteth off the ſpeach, and ſaieth, <hi>J haue many moe things to ſpeake to you, but ye cannot beare them now:</hi> That is, ye are not capable of them now. There were other cauſes, no doubt, that here vrged him to cut ſhort his language: as namely, becauſe the houre of his death was at hand, as <hi>Chap. 14. verſ. 30.</hi> Another was, becauſe, as hee ſaieth, <hi>Chap. 15. verſ. 15.

The Lord knew well, what power he hath giuen to euerie one to vnderſtand the waye of ſaluation, and according therevnto hee meaſureth his inſtruction: hee ſubmitteth himſelfe to their rudeneſſe and capacitie. If thou be an Infant, hee will not giue thee ſolide and ſtrong foode, but Milke: So hee willeth a Miniſter to meaſure the doctrine, conforme to the grouth and power of the hearers: The Miniſters in euerie Congregation, ſhould know who are Infants, and who are not, and accordinglie vſe diſcretion.</p>

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:16631:74"/>
ſtriue to get Ieſus Chriſt, and to ſee his face more and more, as it were in a glaſſe, till once our fayth bee turned into ſight, and then wee ſhall get ſacietie of knowledge. Howe dangerous a thing it is, to a man who hath gotten but little knowledge, there to bide, the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes, Chap. 6. verſ. 4.</hi> declareth, for there he denounceth an heauie judgement againſt thoſe, who haue got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a piece af knowledge, and ſtand there, yea, and fall away from it, hee ſaieth, there is no place of repentance for them. And indeed it is not poſſible, but if a man gette once a ſolide taſte and ſight of thoſe heauenlie thinges, but hee will ſtriue moſt earneſtlie to haue a farder knowledge, ſight, and fore-taſting of them night and daye, euen till hee get full ſacietie of joye and glorie. <hi>1. Petr. 2 verſ. 2.</hi> Therefore, I beſeech you neuer to reſt, till yee get a ſight of Chriſt by and aboue all knowledge, that in him yee may haue all perfection: To whome, with the Father, and the holie Spirit, bee all praiſe, honour and glory, worlde without ende.</p>
            <p>So bee it.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE heard the laſt daye (Beloued Brethren) howe the Lord, in that long diſcourſe and ſpeach which he continueth with his Diſciples, a little before his departure out of this worlde: after hee had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned them of their afflictions, and had gentlie reprooued them, and comforted them, by telling them, that it was good for them, that hee did aſcend, for then hee ſhould ſend them the holy Spirit, hee entered into a profound do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, concerning the holy Spirit, whome hee was to ſende to his Diſciples after his departure to Heauen. Hee ſhewed them what the Spirite ſhould doe, chiefely in reſpect of the obſtinate worlde, and the Iewes, who would not belieue: when hee ſhall come, hee ſhall conuict them of three thinges: The firſt is, of that ſinne, the greateſt ſinne in the worlde, the ſinne of Infidelitie: The next is, that Ieſus Chriſt, whome they eſteemed to bee an vnjuſt man, the holy Spirit ſhall conuict them, that that Chriſt is the holieſt in the world: The third thing, that he is not only juſt and holy, but he is the glorious Iudge of the worlde: And that ſhall appeare in this chiefely, that he hath condemned the Deuils. When he hath dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped into this doctrine, hee cutteth it off, ſaying, I haue manie things to ſpeake to you, whereof ye are not capable.</p>
            <p>Then, leſt the Diſciples ſhould haue beene offended with him,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:16631:75"/>
that hee would not goe forwarde in teaching them: in the firſt wordes of this Text the Lord meeteth this, and hee comforteth them with a promiſe, <hi>That when that Spirit ſhall come, which is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of trueth, he ſhould leade them in all kind of trueth,</hi> and inſtruct them in all thoſe thinges which the Lord ſpake not to them. In this Text the Lord continueth his ſpeach of the holie Spirite, and of thoſe thinges hee ſhould doe in the worlde. This appeareth of the firſt wordes wee haue read, that the Lord would haue his Diſciples to vnderſtand, that the holy Spirit ſhould be a more profitable Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher to them, than Chriſt himſelfe was by his owne voyce before his Paſsion: and therefore hee remitteth farder doctrine to the Spirite. It is better to haue the Spirite of Chriſt, without Chriſtes bodilie preſence, than to haue the preſence of Chriſt, not teaching thee inwardlie by the Spirite: Yea, I ſaye more, It is better to haue the voyce of a poore ſimple man, ſpeaking to thee, in the Name of Ieſus Chriſt, together with the holie Spirit, than to haue the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe, and his outward voyce, if thou haue not the Spirite. What auailed it to the obſtinate Iewes, who belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued not into him, that they ſawe him, and heard him? It had bene better, that they had neuer knowne him. It is not the voyce that doeth the turne, but the powerfull working of the holie Spirite: the holie Spirite reformeth the mindes. If the voyce of CHRIST were ſounding among you this daye, (as ſweete as it is) it would doe you no good without the Spirit: Therefore take not ſo much heede to the man who teacheth outwardlie, as to the Spirite: and as yee would be ſafe, as yee heare that outwarde teaching, ſtriue to feele the Spirit of Chriſt inſtructing, illuminating, and mollifying your hearts: other wayes it were far better for you, neuer to heare a word.</p>
            <p>Yet to marke the words more narrowlie: hee ſaieth, <hi>That Spirit, which is the Spirite of trueth, ſhall leade you in all trueth</hi>: that is, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning your ſaluation. In ſtiling the Spirite, hee giueth an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherefore hee ſhall teach them the trueth, Becauſe he is the Spirite of trueth: the true Spirite can teach nothing but the trueth. If a man or woman, therefore, woulde bee inſtructed by that Spirite of Trueth, and woulde bee ledde into all Trueth, then let this bee ſetled into their heartes, That that Spirite which ſpeaketh, is true: Yee knowe that no man will credite another in weightie matters, without hee knowe hee bee true: Euen ſo, if this opinion bee not ſetled into thine heart, that he is true, thou
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:16631:76"/>
will neuer belieue the Scriptures of God.</p>
            <p>To goe to an higher ground: If one would be inſtructed in the trueth by the Spirite, hee muſt haue a loue to the verity, and deſire to knowe the verity: where there is no loue of the trueth, there muſt be an hatred of the trueth: <hi>Hee who is not with mee, is againſt mee.</hi> And where the Deuill findeth ſuch an heart, hee is effectuall in it in all vanities: becauſe, (as Paul ſaieth, <hi>2. Theſſal. 2. verſ. 9.</hi>) where men haue not a loue of the trueth, God giueth them ouer to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue lies, that they might bee condemned, and carried into perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So as thou wouldeſt liue, hunger for the trueth; as a man hungereth for temporall foode: then when this appetite is wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſettle this perſwaſion in thine heart, that that holy Spirit who ſpeaketh, is true: then the heart of man and woman will drinke in the doctrine of the trueth, with greater ſweetneſſe and joye, than euer any hungry man hath had in eating Meat.</p>
            <p>Yet the words would be better marked: He ſaith not ſimply, he ſhall leade them in the trueth, but <hi>in all trueth</hi>: there ſhall bee no point of trueth, but hee ſhall inſtruct you therein. It will not bee a piece of the trueth that will fill the heart: but the ſinner that wold be ſafe, would vnderſtand the whole way to ſaluation: hee can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be ſatisfied to drinke in the trueth: and the more hee drinketh in, he deſireth aye to drinke more. This is the diſpoſition of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, who hath taſted how ſweete that Milke of the word is, as Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſaith, <hi>1. Epist. Chap. 2. verſ. 1.2.</hi> This place letteth vs ſee, that it was not onely a part of the trueth, that was committed to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie: they receiued not an imperfect doctrine, but the whole Myſterie of ſaluation was reuealed and laid before them: and that which they receiued, they deliuered againe faithfully. Paul ſaith, <hi>Act. 20. verſ. 27. I haue not hid any thing from you, but I haue ſhowne you the whole counſell of God</hi>: And whatſoeuer thinges the Apoſtles preached in the world with their mouth, all in effect and ſubſtance they wrote with their hands, to the weale of the Kirke: and there is not one point, which either concerneth Gods glory, or mans ſaluation, but in effect we haue it regiſtrated in the Olde and New Teſtament. Away with the vnwritten verities: whatſoeuer was preached, all is regiſtrated to the weale of the people: And If all the Apoſtles were this daye preaching, they woulde not preach one worde in effect, but that which wee haue already regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated. I will affirme that before God, the holy Spirite will not teach any thing to the heart, but that which is written in the Old
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:16631:76"/>
and Newe Teſtament: Yea, more, true fayth will drinke in none other thing, but that which is within this compaſſe of the worde: and if thou drinkeſt in any other thing than this, I affirme before God, thou neuer hadſt true fayth: Let no Spirit bee pretended to this: let no fayth be pretended to this. Away with thoſe Papiſts, who commend ſo highly the vaine traditions of men, and vnwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten verities: they haue no true fayth: It is only the Spirit who lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs in all verity. Then he giueth them the reaſon, <hi>Becauſe that Spirit ſhall not ſpeake of himſelfe: but whatſoeuer hee ſhall heare, that ſhall hee ſpeake.</hi> As if hee had ſaid, Yee will credite me: and I aſſure you, that Spirite will ſpeake nothing, but that which hee hath receiued of mee. Whatſoeuer the Spirite of God teacheth the world, while as hee is in the Heauen, hee receiueth it out of the mouth of Ieſus Chriſt. And farder: whatſoeuer thing the Lord ſpake during the time he was in the world, hee receiued it out of the mouth of the Father. Looke this harmonie of teaching among the glorious perſons of the Trinitie: He ſaith not one thing, and he another, as men doe: The Father beginneth, and hee ſpeaketh: then the Sonne ſpeaketh the ſame: and the holy Spirit ſpeaketh nothing, but that which the Father and the Sonne haue ſpoken. Looke the worde and decreet of our ſaluation: It is a concluſion giuen out by all the three perſons of the Godhead. If it bee ſo, certainly the worde of the Goſpel of Ieſus Chriſt, it muſt be a thing of great authoritie: For that decree which is laide in the Kings Counſell, hath a great authoritie among the Subiectes: and the worde of the Counſell, is greater than the word of the King only. If this be among Kinges in the earth, of what authority ſhould this be, that commeth from the decree of the glorious Counſell of that bleſſed Trinitie, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect whereof, all the Kinges of the earth are but droſſe? Nowe would to God the heartes of men could ſee this great authority of this worde! So this worde muſt craue a great fayth. The King would be angry if his decree were not credited: then what judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall abide vs, wormes, if wee belieue not the decree of the glorious Trinitie? I ſaye this before God, The contempt of the Goſpel of Ieſus Chriſt, bringeth on with it, the heauieſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the worlde. And if ſuch a contempt of the worde in this Land continue, an heauy iudgement no queſtion, ſhall light vpon them, who haue not credited ſuch a decree. <hi>Iohn, 12. verſ. 44.</hi> Therefore ſeeing the word of the Goſpel is of ſuch authoritie, let all men who would ſee Heauen, ſtriue to belieue it in their hearts:
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:16631:77"/>
or elſe, if they belieue not, an heauie judgement ſhall ouer-take them: let them beware.</p>
            <p>In the ende of the <hi>verſ.</hi> hee bringeth in more particularly what the Spirit ſhall teach: Hee ſaieth, <hi>Hee ſhall ſhew you the thinges to come</hi>: that is, The thinges which ſhall followe after my departure, mine aſcenſion, and glorification: the thinges which were acquired by his death, and applied by his reſurrection, as remiſsion of ſinnes, juſtification, and life eternall, hee ſhall teach you them inwardlie, and hee ſhall ſeale them vp into your heartes: For after the Lord had ſuffered in the earth, then grace came downe, then remiſsion of ſinnes came downe, that free righteouſneſſe of Chriſt came downe, and life euerlaſting came downe, as alſo extraordinarie gifts came downe, as the gift of Propheſie, the gift of healing, of working of miracles, of ſpeaking ſundry languages, &amp;c. for why? when the Lord Ieſus was filled with glory, of that fulneſſe the members heere in the earth receiued their part: and grace for grace came downe, as it was propheſied, <hi>Hee went vp on high, and led captiuitie captiue, and gaue giftes vnto men.</hi> And all theſe things gaue he by the holy Spirit, illuminating the mind, and working powerfull in the heart: for other wayes what auaileth it to haue remiſsion of ſinnes, life, glory, and happineſſe for euer, effected? Except the Spirit of Ieſus Chriſt accompany the word, illuminate and molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the heart, all ſhall bee of none auaile. Therefore, againe I bid you, as yee would liue, ſtriue to feele that Spirite working into you.</p>
            <p>Now in the next <hi>verſ.</hi> hee taketh vp ſummarily the effect of all that the Spirit ſhall teach them: <hi>He ſhall glorifie me.</hi> What is it the Spirit is doing? and what is it wee are doing? and whereto is all this preaching? All is to glorifie Chriſt: If thou bee not an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to glorifie Chriſt Ieſus, thou ſhalt haue no part of glorie with him. He giueth the reaſon wherefore the Spirit ſhall glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him, <hi>Becauſe the thing hee ſhall ſhew you, hee ſhall haue it</hi> in commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <hi>from me.</hi> If the ſpeaches of an Ambaſſadour be not to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Prince, hee is but a Traitor. The Sonne was ſent as an Ambaſſadour from the Father: therefore hee glorified the Father, as he ſpeaketh, <hi>Chap. 17. verſ. 7.</hi> So the holy Spirit is ſent from the Sonne: therefore hee ſpeaketh all to the glory of the Sonne. But this would be well vnderſtood, how the Spirit of Chriſt glorifieth Chriſt vpon the earth: Who giueth the Spirite? who ſeeth him? or who heareth his voyce? How then glorifieth the Spirit the Lord?
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:16631:77"/>
The Spirit glorifieth the Lord Ieſus, by the Miniſterie of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and by the mouthes of ſimple men, thinke of them as yee will: except by the mouthes of men, yee ſhall neuer finde the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit glorifying the Sonne, ſeeke where yee will: If wee ſpeake anie thing, wherein God is not glorified, ſay wee are but liars, and the Spirit of Chriſt is not into vs. If wee begin to ſpeake of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, and of the merites of men, of interceſsion of Sainctes, ſaye wee are but lyars: If wee drawe you from that onelie merite of Chriſt, ſaye that the Spirit of God ſpeaketh not by vs, but the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of <hi>Antichrist</hi>: for heereby are the ſpirites diſcerned; hee that teacheth Chriſt onelie, ſpeaketh by the Spirit of Chriſt: but hee who teacheth anie thing beſides Chriſt, hath the ſpirit of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, 1. Ioh. 4. verſ. 2.3.</hi> And this is the ſpirit that teacheth the Pope, and his Clergie, and therefore goe away from them, or elſe yee will bee deceiued: and one day yee ſhall ſee this juſtified, and this day yee ſhould heare with your eares the Lord crying, <hi>Away out of Babylon,</hi> as thou wouldeſt bee ſafe, and ſee Heauen: I haue cryed this oftentimes.</p>
            <p>It might haue beene ſaide, Shall not the Spirit reueale that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine hee hath receiued of the Father? Hee meeteth that now, and ſaith, <hi>Whatſoeuer things the Father hath, are mine.</hi> Marke this: It appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth verie well out of this place, that the holy Spirit is ſent imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatelie of the Sonne, and that he hath his direction of the Sonne our Sauiour: this may comfort vs: indeed the Father ſendeth him, but by the Sonne, and therefore it is ſaide, <hi>Hee ſhall ſende him in my Name</hi>: and againe, <hi>Whom I ſhall ſend from the Father.</hi> Now that which I ſpeake of the Spirit of Ieſus Chriſt, I vnderſtand it of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and of all the faithfull Miniſters in the Kirke. Wee haue all our commiſsion immediatelie from our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: ſo the ſillieſt Miniſter that is faythfull, hath not his calling from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther immediatelie, but from the Sonne. <hi>Epheſ. Chap. 4. verſ. 11. Hee therefore gaue ſome to bee Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Euangeliſtes, and ſome Paſtours, and ſome Teachers.</hi> And <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of himſelfe, calleth himſelfe <hi>the Apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt</hi>: and he addeth to, <hi>by the will of the Father</hi>: whereby hee telleth vs, that hee was ſent immediatelie from the Sonne, and mediatelie from the Father. What is the grounde of this? The Father hath giuen his Sonne all power in Heauen and in Earth: hee hath kept no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from him: <hi>All thine is mine,</hi> as it is ſaid in the next <hi>Chap. verſ. 10.</hi> And vpon this it commeth to paſſe, that the holie Spirite com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:16631:78"/>
immediately from the Sonne, and all the Apoſtles and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in the Kirke are immediately from him: and euen now hee ſitteth like a King, at the right hande of the Father. I ſpeake not this, as if I affirmed, that the Father had put off all power from himſelfe, wee muſt not thinke ſo: no, no, for afterwardes hee ſaith, All mine is thine: ſo this hurteth not the Father: And therefore theſe thinges which are giuen to the Sonne, remaine in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers handes: But the Sonne is the Store-houſe of all grace: and when the Father would giue grace, hee taketh it out of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Sonne, and giueth it to vs by the hand of the Sonne. The Father hath his glorie, the Sonne hath his glorie, and the holie Ghoſt hath his glorie: but wee glorifie the Father, as the Fountaine of all benefites, the Sonne as Mediatour, and the holie Spirite as our Sanctifier: and wee giue them all one equall glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie amongſt themſelues, becauſe they are equall in Glorie and Majeſtie. Therefore, let vs glorifie the Father, the Sonne, and the holie Ghoſt, in this bleſſed Trinitie, who liueth and reigneth world without ende.</p>
            <p>Nowe to goe forwarde: After hee hath fore-warned his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of his departure, and hath comforted them againſt that time; promiſing, that after his departure they ſhould receiue the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, to wit, the holie Spirite: and therefore hee hath ſpoken much of the holie Spirite that ſhoulde come vnto them: Nowe in theſe wordes hee continueth on in the ſame purpoſe, and hee fore-warneth them of his departure, and hee ſayeth, <hi>A little while, and yee ſhall not ſee mee</hi>: meaning, that hee was to depart out of this worlde. Then hee comforteth them in the next wordes, <hi>Againe, a little while, and yee ſhall ſee mee</hi>: meaning, that after his departure, hee ſhould come againe in his Spirite, and by his Spirite hee ſhould giue them his preſence: and hee giueth the reaſon of this his preſence: <hi>for,</hi> ſaieth hee, <hi>J goe to my Father</hi>: that is, I am to paſſe vp to the Heauen, and am to bee glorified, and the Heauen ſhall not containe my glorie, but it ſhall come downe to the Earth: my Spirit, wherewith I ſhall be filled, ſhall come downe to you. For albeit that Chriſt merited, by his death, all benefites to vs, yet they come not to vs but by vertue of his Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, and Glorification: for hee merited all thinges to vs, as a Prieſt, humbled on the earth: but hee communicateth to vs the benefites which hee merited, as a glorious King.</p>
            <p>Nowe, Brethren, yee may ſee this of theſe wordes, That the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:16631:78"/>
LORD hee neuer taketh his preſence from his owne altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: if hee will take awaye his bodilie preſence, (as indeede pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentlie wee haue not his bodilie preſence,) hee will recompence it with his ſpirituall preſence: for this is a ſure thing, The God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie heere on the Earth, cannot want ſome ſight of CHRIST; they cannot liue without ſome preſence of IESVS CHRIST: No, there cannot bee a Kirke without ſome preſence of him: For firſt, Howe is the Kirke made heere vpon the Earth? Who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the ſeparation? Who but IESVS CHRIST? Hee let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth ſuch a number haue his preſence, and ſanctifieth them by his holie Spirite, and ſo maketh a Kirke: And if there were not a continuance of his preſence, the Kirke coulde not ſtande. There is not a member of the Kirke, that coulde ſtand in holineſſe, if it pleaſed the LORD to withdrawe his preſence. Wee haue ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, not of our ſelues, but of the Spirite of the LORD IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS CHRIST: and if hee withdraw his Spirit from vs, wee would become as prophane as the moſt wicked of this worlde. So all our grace, and all our ſtanding, commeth of the Spirit of Ieſus. Then marke this: By what vertue receiue wee the Spirit of Ieſus, and that preſence of Chriſt by his Spirit? Wee receiue it in a word, by vertue of his glorious Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, and Glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Heauens: for nowe being in the Heauens, hee is full of glorie: All the Angels in Heauen are nothing comparable to him in glory: the Heauens are not able to containe his glory. Now the head being full of glory, a portion commeth downe from him, and in ſome meaſure, glorifieth the members: And as <hi>Iohn</hi> ſayeth, <hi>Of his fulneſſe wee all receiue a part, Chap. 1. verſ. 16.</hi> And to the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, Chap. 4. verſ. 8. Hee paſſed vp to the Heauens, and filled vs all with his grace</hi>: and ſo by the paſsing vp of Chriſt to the Heauen, wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the holy Spirit. Therefore, when thou conſidereſt the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and Aſcenſion of Ieſus Chriſt, it ſhould moue thee to take a triall, whether thou haſt gotten the fruit of his Reſurrection and glorification, to ſee if thou haſt gotten his holy Spirite in ſome meaſure, or the graces of his holy Spirite: for the Apoſtles, by his Reſurrection and Aſcenſion, had hope that they ſhould receiue the holy Spirite, and his graces; and ſo they did in effect. And if thou find that thou haſt not gotten the Spirit in no meaſure, no illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, no reformation of thy corrupt nature, ſore may thine heart be: for in reſpect of thee, in vaine is hee riſen, and glorified. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as thou wouldeſt bee partaker of his glory, ſtriue to gette his

holie Spirite, ere thou goeſt out of this worlde, or elſe thou ſhalt neuer get light nor life in the world to come. Farder, hence wee may ſee the Lord leaueth neuer altogether his owne Kirke: for if hee giue not his bodilie preſence, yet hee will giue his ſpirituall preſence: for without his preſence, his Kirke, his Sainctes on earth cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aue a being: for by reaſon of his preſence, the Kirke hath her beginning: for what, I pray you, is the Kirke elſe, but a ſocietie of men and women ſeuered from the reſt of the worlde, by the preſence of that holie Spirit, whereby they are ſealed? Thus farre hath he partlie fore-warned them of his departure, &amp; partly comforted them. It followeth in the Text <hi>Then ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d ſome of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples amongst themſelues, What is this that hee ſayeth vnto vs, A little while, and yee ſhall not ſee me,</hi> &amp;c. They are mooued at theſe wordes: and ſome of them begin to whiſper amongſt themſelues at the wordes which the Lord ſpake. Yee ſee here a marueilous ignorance of the Diſciples of Chriſt: hee hath beene ſpeaking to them ſo long, and yet they vtter a great ignorance. It is a wonderfull thing to ſee how blinded and how hardened a man will be, before hee haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the holie Spirit, at the preaching of the Goſpel, euen at ſuch voyces as would pierce ſtocks and ſtones: Yet a man hearing with reaſon &amp; ſenſe, will conceiue no more of things heauenly, than the ſtockes and ſtones. I tell you this, that no wordes, no preaching, if there be no more but wordes and preaching, can make any man to conceiue heauenly thinges: yea, no admonition, no threatning, no iudgement if there be no more, ſhall make the hardned heart to be the better. The blindeſt thing in the world, is the heart of man. So except the inward Teacher come out of the Heauens, &amp; illuminate &amp; mollify the heart, al the preaching of the world ſhall do the hart no good, but rather euil: ſo that thou mayſt ſee this to be true, that the naturall man is not capable of the things that are of the Spirit of God: but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it pleaſes the Lord t' acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany his word with his Spirit, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> two words ſhall do more good, than a whole preaching before: &amp; th' Apoſtles of Chriſt, after they got this Spirit, profited more in one day, than all their dayes before. So albeit thou heare many preachings, except thou haue that inward Doctor into thine heart, all auails not. Therfore carry that inward teacher into thine hart, &amp; cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge him neuer: ſo if thou want him, run to this preacher, or that, if thou waſt hardned before, thou ſhalt be ſo ſtill. A ſound in the eare wil do no more good than a blaſt of wind, without the Spirit. It follows, <hi>Now Ieſus knew. &amp;c.</hi> He perceiues them wel enough,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:16631:79"/>
and of what thing they were debating: He anſwereth them gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, I know, would he ſay, what ye are thinking and inquiring: and then hee teacheth them more gently. Might not the Lord haue bene angry with them, who vnderſtood him not at the end of the Preaching? But the Lord, as it was propheſied of him, <hi>Iſay. 42.</hi> hee quenched neuer the ſmoaking Flaxe, nor brake the brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Reede: he was euer about to intertaine grace, and not to put it out. All Teachers may take their Leſſon here: they ought not to caſt off people, howbeit they get no fruit of Preachinges: let euer that worde bee driuen into their eares, and let aye that ſeede bee ſowne: for he hath the Spirit, and he will giue him when hee plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth: and let both the auditor and the Preacher pray to God, to giue the Spirit. It is true indeede, the ſeede of the worde of God will lie long lurking into the heart: but at laſt, the Spirit will put to his hand to the worde, as yee heard, <hi>Iohn, 14. verſ. 16.</hi> and will make the worde to fructifie, and to bud out; not onely to the illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the ſoule inwardly, but alſo to good workes out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly. Bee thou euer ſowing that bleſſed ſeede, bee euer prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and then commit the ſucceſſe of all to God.</p>
            <p>When hee hath made a preface to them, yee ſee thereafter with what great lenitie hee inſtructeth them, both concerning his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting, and concerning his returning: Hee inſtructeth them by the effects both of the one and the other, and they are theſe: The firſt is, <hi>Yee ſhall weepe and lament</hi>: The other is, <hi>The worlde ſhall rejoyce</hi>: Theſe are the effects of his departing. Then he declareth his retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by the effect, <hi>But your mourning ſhall bee turned into ioye</hi>: That is, I ſhall come againe, and then ye ſhall haue matter of joye. Ye ſee here a very effectuall kinde of teaching: Hee ſpake this of before, but nowe hee ſpeaketh the ſame thing more effectually. To ſpeake of things barely, and to propone them ſimply, it is not ſo effectuall to mooue the mindes of the hearers, as to declare the ſame by the effectes following: that taketh a greater roote and impreſsion in the heart: As for example, When wee are fore-telling, that by all appearances, the Lord Ieſus is to depart out of this Land, for wee are not worthie of him, albeit this mooue vs; yet this mooueth vs more, when it is ſaid, It ſhall come to paſſe, that thou ſhalt mourne thy ſelfe, thou ſhalt weepe: nowe laugh on as thou wilt, wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>full ſhall be thine ende, and ſhame and confuſion ſhall light vpon thee: I denounce this to thee, in the Name of God. And againe, yee thinke it a light thing to ſaye, The Lord Ieſus ſhall come: but to
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:16631:80"/>
ſaye, Thou who mourneſt, ſhalt rejoyce, when hee ſhall come; that mooueth more. But nowe to come to the matter: <hi>Yee ſhall weepe and lament, and the world ſhall rejoyce</hi>: Some ſhall be weeping, and ſome laughing: this is the difference. Yee ſee the departure of Ieſus Chriſt, is a ſorrowfull thing to the godly: when Chriſt is awaye, the godly are in ſorrowe: the pleaſure of the godly, is aye in the preſence of Ieſus Chriſt: and therefore when they ſee that they want his preſence, they ſee nothing but matter of ſorrowe: and giue them all the pleaſures of the worlde, if they miſſe the Lord awaye, they will haue no joye: And by the contrary, place them in all the ſorrowes in the worlde, if they get a ſight of Ieſus Chriſt, they gette joye enough: But on the other ſide, the wicked and the vngodly, who neuer taſted how ſweet the Lord was, neuer rejoyce, but when they want the Lord Ieſus out of their ſight: they haue no pleaſure in his preſence: they haue neuer pleaſure to heare of Chriſt. What is the cauſe of this? They neuer wiſt what Chriſt meaned: they neuer wiſt what the Lord was, and neuer felt of his ſweetneſſe, and of the joye that is in his preſence: and therefore they haue no pleaſure, but when they want him: And becauſe they cannot gette their wicked will, when Chriſt is preſent, they hate him: for where Chriſt is, (becauſe he is the light of the world,) hee layeth open all wickedneſſe, and maketh it manifeſt: All the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe in the worlde, is in the face of Chriſt: therefore reſt neuer till thou taſte of him, if thou wouldeſt be happy. And againe, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable is that man, who hath not taſted of that ſweetneſſe, and of that grace that is in the Lord. Therefore, as thou wouldeſt come to Heauen, I warne thee yet againe, reſt neuer, till thou gette that reſt in Chriſt, and that ſweetneſſe that is in him.</p>
            <p>Let vs ſee the effect that followeth on his preſence, he ſaith, <hi>Your ſorrow ſhall be turned into joy.</hi> He ſpeaketh of that preſence by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: for after that Spirit is once entered into the ſoule, hee worketh faith, and openeth the eyes of the darke ſoule to ſee Chriſt, as in a mirrour: when the face of Chriſt is borne vp in the worde, <hi>howbeit,</hi> ſaith <hi>Pet. 1. Epist. Chap. 1. verſ. 8. we ſee him not, yet belieuing, we rejoyce with a ioye vnſpeakeable and glorious.</hi> So that darke ſight of him, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth into the ſoule an exceeding joye when wee belieue. I graunt indeede, that as there is no joye in this life, but it hath ſorrowe with it; ſo our joye in Chriſt hath heauineſſe with it: it is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect heere: but it is better for thee to haue a meane portion of that joye, than all the joyes in the worlde: yea, the very diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:16631:80"/>
of the faythfull, is ſo farre from that to hinder the joye, that by the contrary it wakeneth vp the joye in the ſoule: Looke the <hi>2. Epiſt. to the Cor. Chap. 5.</hi> when the ſoule is heauieſt for ſinne, then it findeth ſuch joye, as they would not giue for all the joyes in the worlde: and when this joye is wakened, it ſwalloweth vp all ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes: as in the <hi>8. Chap. to the Rom.</hi> And in the end of the <hi>15. Chap. of the 1. Epiſt. to the Cor.</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>After this life, mortalitie ſhall be ſwallowed vp of immortalitie, and death ſhall be ſwallowed vp in victorie</hi>: and <hi>all teares ſhall bee wiped away from their eyes, Reuel. 7. verſ. 17.</hi> And then they who haue ſorrowe with joye heere, ſhall haue joye without ſorrowe for euer. Looke about you, looke within you, or without you, yee ſhall ſee nothing but matter of joye. So yee ſee the effects of the departure of the Lord, and of his returning againe.</p>
            <p>Nowe heereafter hee maketh this doctrine, of the ſorrowe and joye of the godly, more ſenſible, by a familiare ſimilitude, and it is taken from a woman trauelling: <hi>A woman when ſhee trauelleth,</hi> ſayth hee, <hi>is in dolour, becauſe her houre is come: but when ſhee is deliuered of the Childe, ſhee remembereth no more her dolour, for ioye that a man is borne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the worlde.</hi> Then in the laſt <hi>verſ.</hi> hee applieth it: <hi>Nowe yee are in heauineſſe, and yee are trauelling,</hi> and that is, becauſe <hi>I am to depart from you.</hi> The Diſciples tooke heauilie with the away-going of CHRIST: <hi>But I ſhall ſee you againe, and yee ſhall ſee mee,</hi> and get my preſence by my Spirite, <hi>and yee ſhall reioyce,</hi> and it ſhall bee ſuch <hi>a ioye, that all the worlde ſhall not bee able to take it awaye.</hi> The worlde maye take thy life from thee, but neuer ſhall they take that joye from thee: <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate vs from the loue of Chriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two thinges are heere to bee marked the nature of the dolour of the godlie into this worlde, wandring from their Lorde, as Pilgrimes, and the nature of their ioye: The nature of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, is like the dolour which a woman hath in trauelling: So the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom. Chap. 8. verſ. 21.</hi> he compareth the languor of the dumbe creatures and elementes, after the comming of the Lorde Ieſus, to a woman trauelling. The dolour of a woman trauelling is verie painfull: but yet it is profitable. Why? Becauſe that paine bringeth out a birth: So a woman in trauell hath hope, not onelie to bee ſaued from that paine, but alſo to haue a Childe. So, hope in paine, will haue joye mixed with it. To applye this: It is euen ſo with the diſpleaſure of the godlie, into this their Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, awaiting for their life, which CHRIST will bring downe to them at his comming. 2. <hi>Corinth. Chap. 5.</hi> Looke what
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:16631:81"/>
dolour <hi>Paul</hi> vttereth: hee ſighed vnder a burden, hee deſired to ſlit away, and to goe to dwell with the Lord: Albeit it be but a paine, yet it tendeth to a pleaſure in the ende, to a birth: and in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of dolour, they haue an hope; and with the hope, they haue joye. So a godly man in ſorrowe, will haue the greateſt joye in the worlde: albeit the joye of the godly bee with heauineſſe, yet that joye is vnſpeakeable. The diſpleaſure of the vngodly is not ſo: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede the Scripture (as in the firſt <hi>Epiſtle to the Theſſal. Chap. 5.</hi>) compareth it vnto a woman trauelling: but this is an hopeleſſe paine: What recke if that ſoule had hope, that that paine ſhould ceaſe: but they ſhall neuer looke for a birth: well were it to that ſoule, that that body could bee turned to nothing, after ſo manie thouſand yeeres. The ſorrow of the godly is with hope and joye; but the ſorrowe of the wicked, is without hope. Ieſt not with Hell: it is an horrible thing to fall into the handes of a conſuming fire. Hee ſayeth, When ſhee hath borne her birth, ſhee remembe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not her trauell, becauſe ſhee hath borne her birth; Euen ſo, when wee addreſſe our ſelues to Heauen, thronging thorowe this worlde, wee muſt prepare our ſelues to goe thorowe thornes and brieres, thorow temptations outwarde and inwarde: (a man who would goe to Heauen, he ſhall not put downe his foote without a thorne, or ſome offence:) But when wee are come to the Heauens, then wee ſhall get ſuch a birth of joye, that wee ſhall remember no more the temptations of the worlde: and then wee ſhall finde that ſaying of <hi>Paul</hi> to bee true, <hi>2. Corinth. 4. verſ. 17.</hi> The momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taniall light afflictions ſhall worke an infinite weight of glorie: the ſoule ſhall bee ſo occupied with joye into the Heauens, that wee ſhall count nothing of all afflictions by-paſt. This is true, howbeit wee cannot feele it now ſenſiblie, but once wee ſhall finde it in a full meaſure, if wee appertaine to Chriſt. The Lord there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the meane time, graunt vs a fore-taſting of it, that wee may ouercome all temptations and difficulties, till wee obtaine the full poſſeſſion thereof, in Ieſus Chriſt: To whome, with the Father, and the holie Spirit, bee all honour, praiſe, and glorie, for euermore: AMEN.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Rom the thirteenth Chapter of this Goſpel, (Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren) to the ſeuenteenth, the Lord holdeth pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe only with his Diſciples and Apoſtles: for hee had now ended all his ſpeaking and doing with the people of the Iewes. Hee hath hitherto giuen ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie exhortations vnto them: and hee hath giuen them Cammandements, and inſtructed them, and giuen them ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie argumentes of conſolation, becauſe they were heauie for his departure; and ſo prepared them againſt the time hee was to goe his way, and to leaue them. Nowe his conference and ſpeach dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth to an ende, for it endeth with this preſent Chapter. In the ende of his ſpeach and conference, he recounteth to them particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larlie,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:16631:82"/>
part by part, that felicitie and bleſſing that they ſhall haue after hee is gone away from them to his Father, to be glorified in the Heauens, by his comming again to them, not in the bodie, but in his Spirit: He hath ſaid immediately in the <hi>verſ.</hi> going before, <hi>When ye ſhall ſee mee againe,</hi> that is, when I ſhall come againe to you in my Spirite, after my glorious aſcenſion to the Heauen, <hi>then your heart ſhall reioyce, and no man ſhall take your ioye from you</hi>: all the world ſhall not bee able to twinne you and that joye, which my Spirite ſhall furniſh you. So then, Brethren, there is the joy which they ſhall haue, when the Lord ſhall come againe, they ſhall haue ioye, and ioye euerlaſtinglie; and ſpirituall ioy, and that for euermore.</p>
            <p>This is the firſt part of their bleſſedneſſe: the wordes are eaſie, and I ſpake of them before, onely this for the preſent: Wee muſt not thinke that this ioye which Chriſt promiſed to his Diſciples by his Spirite, went awaye, and died with the Apoſtles, when they departed out of this worlde: but it abideth in the Kirke of Ieſus Chriſt to the ende of the world: Euen as that holy Spirite whome the Lord ſent downe to the world, abideth in his Kirke, till Chriſt come againe, and ſupplieth as it were, the bodily preſence of Ieſus Chriſt: (for the Spirite of Chriſt, is the Vicare of Chriſt in the earth, and not the Pope, as the Papiſts ſay:) Euen ſo, I ſay, by that Spirit abideth here in the Kirke of God, ſolide ioye to the ende of the world: for whereſoeuer the Spirit is, there is ioye and inward conſolation: and that ſoule in whom the Spirite of God dwelleth, feeleth as ſenſibly as one feeleth with their hands, the ioy &amp; peace of the holy Spirit: for that Spirit, is the Spirit of ioy &amp; peace: and they who feele not the ſenſe of this ioye, alace, they want this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. They who feele not ſpirituall ioy at anie time, hath matter of ſorrow and mourning, for they haue not the Spirit of Ieſus Chriſt: and they who want his Spirite, haue not adoe with Chriſt. <hi>Rom. 8. verſ. 9.</hi> and conſequently neuer ſhall taſte of ioye: but thou who haſt felt this ioy, haſt cauſe to reioyce, yea, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayeth, <hi>to reioyce euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, 1. Theſ. 5. verſ. 16. Paul</hi> recommendeth ioye vnto vs, not for an houre, or a day, or a moneth, or a yeere, but perpetually: meaning, that there is great matter of continuall ioy offered by that Spirit, who graciouſly lighteneth our ſoules, &amp; aſſureth vs of ſaluation. What ſhould mooue thee to ioy? Should not good tidings mooue thee to reioyce? Yet we reioyce not: &amp; this want of ioy declareth that we make reſiſtance to the holy Spirit: wee will not ſuffer the Spirit to come in; &amp; when he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth in, we giue him ſober inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:16631:82"/>
but by our euill life, we cauſe him to depart with ſadnes.</p>
            <p>Now to goe to that ſecond part of that bleſſedneſſe which they ſhall haue when the Lord ſhall returne to them by his holie Spirit: <hi>Jn that day yee ſhall aske mee nothing:</hi> that is, Yee ſhall not aye doubt: for yee heard before, when hee ſaide, <hi>Yet a little while, and yee ſhall not ſee mee: and againe, ye ſhall ſee mee</hi>: there they doubted what he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Now, would he ſay, ye ſhall not doubt then, but the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſhall teach you, he ſhall inlighten the darknes of your ſoules, &amp; make you to belieue. To apply this to our ſelues: Eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, of the firſt part of the bleſſednes promiſed to the Apoſtles, ſo I ſay of the ſecond part of their bleſſednes, (for what recks vs what light, or what knowledge the Apoſtles got, if we get not a part of it?) which ſtands in the inward teaching of the holy Spirit, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the vaile from them, &amp; opening vp of their blind eyes, to ſee ſaluation. This Spirit went not away out of the world with th' Apoſtles, but he abideth ſtil in the world, till Chriſt come again: Euen as the Spirit abides, ſo the inward teaching of the ſoul by the Spirit abides in the Kirke: for as the Spirit is the Spirit of ioye, ſo he is the Spirit of knowledge: he opens the eye of the ſoule, which is dark; &amp; mollifies the hart, &amp; that with ſuch a ſweetnes to receiue grace, as the tong neither of man, nor Angel, can expreſſe. And the godly, no doubt, at the preaching of the Goſpel of Chriſt, will feele that inward operatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Spirit in their ſoule. Study ay to feele this by experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce (for what auails Chriſt to vs, if we feel him not?) they will feele a light ſhining in their ſoules, as the ſhining of the Sunne: &amp; they will feele their heart, that was hardned before, with a ſweet conſolation to be mollified: as it is ſaid of <hi>Lydia</hi> the Purple ſeller, that <hi>by the preaching of the Goſpel, her hart was opened, Act. 16.</hi> And on the contrary, let the man or woman who wants this ſenſe, who ſeeth no light, nor finds no opening of the ſoule, blame the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, and not the light: for Chriſt offereth himſelfe to all alike: the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacke thereof proceedeth of the contempt of the word, &amp; of that light that ſhineth ſo brightlie without thy ſoule, and goeth not in. And ſurelie, it is a fearefull thing to contemne this Light: for if thou contemne this light, I tell thee, long ſhalt thou ſit hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and ſhalt not bee the better, but ſhalt growe aye the harder, till thou bee ſo hardened and obdured, that thou canſt feele no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all.</p>
            <p>Brethren, yee may thinke it a wonderfull thing, that a bodie, who ſitteth hearing continuallie, and who hath ſo cleare a light
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:16631:83"/>
glancing aye before him, ſhould get no light at all, but ſhould go out of the Kirke more blind than when he came in: and yet indeed it is ſo; for many come in to heare, but becauſe they come in with colde and euill diſpoſed heartes, hauing no delight to heare the worde of God, they goe away more prophane, and worſe than when they came in: And therefore, for lacke of this, the miſerable worlde periſheth, the multitude goeth wholly to deſtruction. Therefore, for Chriſtes ſake, Brethren, learne to haue a pleaſure and ioye in hearing, and take in that Spirit into your ſoules. Wee haue hearde of the ſeconde part of the bleſſedneſſe which Chriſt promiſeth to his Diſciples, after his glorious Aſcenſion to the Heauen: to wit, the light and knowledge of the holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>Nowe to come to the thirde benefite, or the thirde part of their happineſſe, wherein all grace is promiſed to them who aske: Hee beginneth very grauely, <hi>Verily, verily, Amen, Amen, J ſaye to you</hi>: that is, It is a true ſaying, and yee ſhall finde it true indeed, eſſay it when yee will: <hi>Whatſoeuer thing ye ſhall aske the Father in my Name, hee will giue it you.</hi> In one word, this is the third part of their bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, All grace and mercy is to bee had for the asking: not by buying, for all grace is bought by the price of the blood of the Lambe onely: ſeeing that is ſo precious a ranſome, no man hath neede to buy any thing at the handes of God: we haue no neede to buy any grace of God by our merites: for by that only merite and blood of Chriſt, all grace is bought. We haue need of asking: and if wee aske not in his Name, wee ſhall neuer get grace, for there is not another Name vnder Heauen (ſayeth the Apoſtle) by whome there is ſaluation, but onely by the Name of Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Act. 4. verſ. 12.</hi> So there is the third part of their bleſſedneſſe that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed them: Euen all grace ſhall bee giuen them for the asking. To drawe this to our ſelues, (And the Lord giue vs grace to doe it,) As by the Spirite all joye, all knowledge, and light abideth in his Kirke on earth, till the Lord IESVS come againe; Euen ſo, all grace, all mercy, abideth in this Kirke militant, till the Lord come againe: for if that Spirit of grace abide in this Kirke, of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity all grace muſt abide with that Spirite. The faythfull in the Kirke, who are Chriſtians in heart, and not in worde, onely they will finde in experience, that when they aske any grace, as righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, and ſanctification, life euerlaſting, and glorification, they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will not ſo ſoone open their mouth to aske it, but they will get it: And when they ſay, Lord, renewe mine affections, the word
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:16631:83"/>
will not ſo ſoone bee ſpoken, but as ſoone they will finde the ſoule opened with ioye: and when they ſaye, Lord, giue mee that life for Chriſtes ſake, with the worde, the life of Ieſus will bee felt in the ſoule ſenſiblie. Therefore, preaſſe aye to finde by experience, that the preſence of Chriſt is no emptie winde. By the contrarie, if a man or woman finde in no meaſure, no grace, or no ſenſe of grace, in their ſoules, let them blame themſelues: for they want grace, for plaine fault of asking. Alace, that wee ſhould loſe ſuch grace for fault of ſeeking! Is hee not a fooliſh man, that will loſe life for a worde? But it is not ſo light a thing to aske as ſo, for euerie man, and euerie woman, hath not the gift of prayer: Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thou bee the ſonne of GOD, thou ſhalt haue no power to open thy mouth to call GOD Father: If thou bee a ſlaue, thou ſhalt haue no power to praye to GOD: for prayer is the proper note of the Childe of GOD: and except the Spirite of Adoption teſtifie vnto thee, that thou art the ſonne of GOD, thou ſhalt haue no power to praye, but thy mouth ſhall bee clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: But when the Spirite will teſtifie to thee, that thou art the ſonne of GOD, then the heart will open, and the tongue wil ſay ſweetly, O Father! Therefore, the ground of all grace is the grace to aske: get once grace to praye, and then thou haſt all grace: And therefore, when the Lord ſayth, <hi>Knocke, and it ſhall be opened: aske, and thou ſhalt haue,</hi> &amp;c. ſay, Lord, giue mee grace to aske. Take aye heed to the gift of prayer, for wee loſe all for fault of prayer, and for fault of begging. So I beſeech you all, Brethren to pray, as euer ye would ſee Heauen, or be partakers of life. In the words following, when hee hath ſet downe the thirde parte of their felicitie, That they ſhould praye vnto the Father for grace, knowing the great neceſsitie they had to praye, and their great ſluggiſhneſſe on the other part, hee beginneth to allure them to pray, and to ſtir them vp to aske at the handes of the Father. And leſt they ſhould haue obiected, We haue asked, but we haue not beene anſwered; hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth to this, <hi>Hitherto ye haue ſought nothing at the Father in my Name: but</hi> in times comming, <hi>aske boldly, and looke for an anſweee, and yee ſhall get grace</hi> heaped vpon grace, till your grace bee perfect: and the greater grace thou askeſt, the greater thou getteſt: and the more thou getteſt, the greater is thy ioye that thou haſt, when thou perceiueſt that grace: and thou who haſt gotten it, wouldeſt not giue it for all the worlde. This is the meaning of the wordes. Take vp heere what neceſsitie wee haue to praye: for if wee
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:16631:84"/>
had no neede, the Lord would not haue ſtirred vp his Diſciples to praye: No, no, wee haue ſo great neede to praye, that except wee praye, wee gette nothing. A Beggar, who hath nothing but that which he beggeth, if he leaue off his begging, he ſhall die at dike ſide. If thou leaue off thy ſpirituall begging, yea, though thou were a King, and hadſt all the worlde, thou ſhalt die for euer: For what is a King in this life, but a Beggar? And woe be to him, if he be not a Beggar at the handes of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Then marke the ſluggiſhneſſe in euery man and woman, and how vnable we are to beg. A Beggar who hath nought, ere hee die, hee will crie and ſhout: but a poore ſinner, who is the pooreſt man, and the ſillieſt creature in the world, who wanteth all grace, hath not a mouth to aske, though he ſhould die. Now to ſtirre vs vp to pray, the Lord ſayeth, <hi>Aske at the Father,</hi> and eſſay if ye get a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall. Wee know all this, yet wee lie ſleeping in ſinne, and ſeeke no grace to be fred of it, howbeit grace be ſo freely offered to vs by Ieſus Chriſt. It is a ſore thing, to bee a poore body, and to lie ſtill, and ſeeke nothing: We are poore bodies, ſleeping in a dead ſleep: and except we be wakened, we will not riſe out of it, or once open our mothes, to ſay, God helpe mee: And then, when wee haue ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned our mouthes to ſpeake a word, it will be coldly and wearſhlie ſaide: this is our nature.</p>
            <p>Then marke laſt, what mercifull care the Lord hath ouer vs: we would for euer lie ſtill, and die in pouertie, if the Lord ſaide not, Waken, waken. The Lord Ieſus not onely wakened his Diſciples, but, to the end of the world, he is euer wakening his owne, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by faire wordes, and ſometimes by boaſting, and ſometimes by afflictions, to moue them to pray in his Name. Sometimes out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly the Lord will come and ſtrike thee: (what reckes of all the ſtrokes in the world, though thou ſhouldeſt be buffetted and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, yea, and pulled in pieces, and if it bee to free thee from Hell?) Sometimes inwardly hee will pricke thee, and ſtirre vp thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to accuſe thee, and he will open the eyes of thy ſoule, to ſee thine owne miſerie, and want. And when the Lord hath wakened thee, that thou beginneſt once to ſigh for grace, hee will bee at thy right hand, and ſtirre thee vp to praye: and then the ſigh for grace ſhall not ſo ſoone come out, but it ſhall aſcende to God: for that ſame ſigh, though it were neuer ſo ſmall, being raiſed from the heart by his owne holy Spirit, he cannot mis know it, but hee muſt ſende thee an anſwere: and then thine heart is kindled vp with a
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:16631:84"/>
ſweet ſenſe of thy God: But ſhouldeſt thou then leaue off to pray? No, no, but then thou ſhouldeſt praye faſteſt: for a poore bodie, who hath gotten a pennie, will be very well content, and will giue many thankes: And thou who haſt gotten a part of Spirituall grace, wilt thou not giue thanks? Yea, thanke and thanke againe, for there is no time to leaue off prayer, but aye to praye and giue thankes. There are two thinges, thou haſt either a ſenſe of thine own miſery, or els a ſenſe of the grace of God beſtowed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee: and then ſhouldeſt thou not praye? There is not an houre but wee ſhould praye: for <hi>Paul, Epheſ. 6. verſ. 18.</hi> recommendeth prayer vnto them in this manner, <hi>Praying with all kinde of ſupplication, and at all times.</hi> Wee muſt bee aye fighting with our inwarde enemies, and thoſe ſpirituall powers of darkneſſe: there ſhould bee no reſt, no, not a moment: and as the battel hath no reſt, ſo wee ſhould neuer leaue off to praye: for and if thou leaue off to praye, thou ſhalt not ſtande, but yeelde, and giue thy ſelfe ouer to thine enemies. In one word, there is no time granted vnto vs, to be voyde of an heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie diſpoſition, and if thine heart bee well diſpoſed to praye: and thinke not that this will hinder thee of any worldly exerciſes: bee aye communing with God, in whatſoeuer thing thou doeſt: for it ſhall bee ſo farre from hindering thee, that it ſhall further thee: and when thou goeſt to doe any worke, ſaye, Lord, bleſſe this worke: and when thou enterprizeſt any thing, ſeeke aye the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God: let thine heart be euer ſpiritually diſpoſed.</p>
            <p>This is the cauſe why the worlde is ſo prophane, and hath ſo little minde of God, and hath ſo foule heartes, that will ſpeake ſo foule blaſphemies, and filthie purpoſes: the Adulterer will worke his vile adulterie, and the foule Murderer his murders, &amp;c. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they want prayer, and then the Lord leaueth them, and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them wallow in their miſchiefe, till at the laſt he giueth them ouer to the hands of the Deuill.</p>
            <p>Now when he hath wakened them, hee commeth to the fourth part of the bleſſedneſſe they ſhall haue, when hee ſhall returne, <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto,</hi> ſayeth hee, <hi>I haue ſpoken in parables</hi>: that is, in obſcure and darke ſentences: <hi>But when J ſhall come againe, I ſhall ſpeake nothing in parables,</hi> but mith a great euidence, that ye ſhall not neede to doubt of one worde. Brethren, vnderſtand this; for when the Lord was into the worlde amongſt the Iewes, for the moſt part hee ſpake in parables, and his ſpeaches and preachings were obſcure: ſo it was harde to take vp his ſpeaches: and therefore yee may reade, in the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:16631:85"/>
thirteenth <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>Matth.</hi> that commonly he ſpake in parables: that is, all which he ſpake was not euident: and not only were his ſpeaches obſcure to the multitude, but to his Diſciples alſo: as this, <hi>A little while, and yee ſhall not ſee mee: and againe, a little while, and yee ſhall ſee mee.</hi> Yet he expounded the parables to his Diſciples, as ye reade in that ſame <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>Matth.</hi> And till he came againe out of the Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to them by his Spirit, it was hard to vnderſtand him. What was the cauſe of this, that hee woulde ſpeake ſo obſcurelie, not onely to the multitude, but alſo to his owne Diſciples? When Chriſt was in the world, the worke of the redemption of man was not wrought; Chriſt had not ſuffered, nor riſen againe, nor paſſed vp to the Heauen, he was not glorified: and therefore the ſpeaches of the redemption of man, being a thing to come, could not bee ſo plaine: but nowe all is paſt, and there are no more parables, but all are cleare ſpeaches of the redemption: the ſpeaches of the thinges to come, cannot bee ſo cleare as the ſpeaches of a thing done and ended. The Lord ſpake more clearly by the mouth of his Apoſtles, of the worke of our redemption, than hee did himſelfe with his owne mouth.</p>
            <p>To drawe this to our ſelues: As the Lord hath giuen to vs, to haue that ioye, and that knowledge, which was promiſed to the Diſciples, and all grace and mercy for the asking; Euen ſo, we haue in the Kirke of Ieſus Chriſt this daye, the ſame plainneſſe in ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Croſſe: and, as the Apoſtle ſayeth, <hi>The Lord Jeſus is cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified before our eyes.</hi> Speake not the Apoſtles clearly vnto vs in theſe Writs which are left? Haue wee not the foure Euangels? the beſt Booke that euer was, (make of it as yee will,) and thoſe Epiſtles of Paul, and the reſt of the Apoſtles, written in ſuch euidencie and plainneſſe, euen the ſame thing in effect which they preached? And in a manner wee haue the Apoſtles ſpeaking vnto vs, in that eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie wherein they ſpake when they liued. And if a man woulde take thoſe Writs in his handes, and eſpy them well, he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Spirite of God in them. And nowe alſo, the Lord raiſeth vp men to ſpeake with liuely words, and to builde on that founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Prophets and Apoſtles: Not Hay nor Stubbles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the Lord raiſeth vp men to builde on the foundation, (as the Apoſtle ſayeth,) Siluer, and Golde, and precious ſtones: and as Paul ſayth of himſelfe, and the reſt of the Apoſtles. <hi>2. Corinth. 4. verſ. 3.</hi> Hee who worketh light out of darkneſſe, the ſame God cauſeth the light of his preſence to ſhine in our hearts thorow Ieſus Chriſt, to
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:16631:85"/>
giue the light of knowledge of the worlde. Now by them there is no doubt, but the LORD ſhineth into the heartes of ſome men, that they may giue light vnto others: light aboundantlie ſhineth into the worlde, ſo that none haue cauſe to bee darkened for fault of light: but as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſayeth, in the ſeconde Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the fourth <hi>Chapter,</hi> and thirde <hi>verſ. If the Goſpel bee hid, it is hid to them that periſh</hi>: So ſaye I, if thou bee not lightened, thou ſhalt die: and if thou getteſt not illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by theſe ſame men, (count of them as thou wilt, and lightlie them as thou pleaſeſt,) die ſhalt thou euerlaſtinglie: and ſaye with thy ſelfe, And if I gette not illumination, I will die without remedie. And I denounce againſt thee, that if thou getteſt not illumination by this ſame Miniſterie, count of it as thou wilt, thou ſhalt die for euer.</p>
            <p>The laſt part of that felicitie is this, A readineſſe and eaſineſſe of GOD, to heare their prayers night and daye, <hi>Yee ſhall aske in my Name,</hi> ſayeth the LORD, <hi>and J ſaye not, that I ſhall praye the Father for you.</hi> Indeede, would hee ſaye, I praye continuallie. And no doubt the LORD IESVS in the daye of his humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion prayed: and neuer one prayed as he prayed, with ſuch a faith, ſuch a zeale, and ſuch a ſenſe: No, let him haue the degree aboue all that euer prayed from the beginning of the worlde: Hee felt beſt the miſerie of man, and pittied it: And when hee went tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe the Streetes of HIERVSALEM, or whereſoeuer he went, hee behelde the miſerable bodies, and hee prayed for them vnto his Father. And thou likewiſe, therefore, when thou goeſt tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe the ſtreetes of EDINBVRGH, looke about thee vnto the miſerable multitude, and ſee if thou haſt not cauſe to praye to GOD for them, that hee would bee mercifull to them. This ſhould bee thine exerciſe: and no doubt CHRIST was ſo exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed heere on earth: but nowe, when CHRIST is exalted to his glorie, to ſaye that hee will kneele downe on his knees, and praye to the Father, as the Papiſtes ſaye, it is but a dreame: for all that was a parte of his humiliation: The LORD IESVS is an euerlaſting Mediatour, and there is none ende thereof: And that Croſſe is as liuelie before the Father, as that ſame night wherein hee was crucified, and ſo are his prayers: for hee is an Aduocate, (not like our Aduocates,) hee is a crucified Aduocate: Looke to him, for there is no life but in the ſight of him. And as
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:16631:86"/>
for his praying and humbling himſelfe, thinke not that all is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed: no, all abideth euerlaſtinglie: for that Prayer which yee ſhall heare in the CHAPTER following, and all his Prayers which hee made to his Father, abideth yet, and ſhall abide euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtinglie.</p>
            <p>Then, ſayeth hee, thinke not that I ſhall praye then for you, as I was wont to doe, but yee ſhall bee hearde, <hi>Becauſe the Father loueth you.</hi> Yee ſee, a man who loueth another, hee will heare him willinglie. And wherefore loueth hee you? <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſayeth hee, <hi>yee loue mee.</hi> GOD will requite loue with loue: yea, GOD will preuent thy loue, with his infinite loue: and then thine heart is drawne to him: And looke howe often thou wilt loue him, hee will as often compaſſe thy loue, with his loue: and what is thy loue, but a ſorie thing, in reſpect of that infinite loue of his?</p>
            <p>Then hee ſayeth, <hi>Yee haue belieued, that I am come out from GOD.</hi> Yee ſee the grounde of this readineſſe, is fayth in IESVS CHRIST. I will ende in one worde, and woulde to GOD this loue could enter into our heartes: Wilt thou loue the Sonne of GOD from thine heart, and not in worde onelie? (For loue ſtandeth not in a worde,) and wilt thou belieue him, that hee hath died for thy ſinnes, and riſen for thy glorie? Then euerie daye and houre his eare ſhall bee readie to heare thy prayer. A man will thinke it no ſmall matter, to haue the eare of a King patent and readie when hee calleth: The LORD ſhall bowe his eare to thee night and day, if thou belieue in IESVS CHRIST. Is this anie ſmall thing, that the LORD of Heauen ſhall heare thee when thou ſhalt call vpon him? So his eare through loue, by faith in IESVS CHRIST, is euer patent to heare his owne. Yet there is an higher grounde of this: to wit, that wonderfull loue which the Father beareth to the Sonne: If thou loueſt him, hee will loue thee: and if thou bee an enemie to him, hee will bee an open enemie to thee: <hi>If there bee anie man who loueth not the LORD IES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S, let him bee Anathema, and Anathema Maranatha, 1. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth. Chap. 16. Verſ. 12.</hi> That is, Curſed for euer. Hee who loueth the LORD IESVS, is bleſſed for euer: and he who hateth the LORD IESVS, is curſed for euer. Nowe would to GOD wee had an heart to ſaye with <hi>Paul,</hi> The man who loueth not CHRIST, let him be <hi>Anathema</hi>! From whence roſe this? From a wonderfull loue which the Apoſtle bare to the LORD IESVS.
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:16631:86"/>
And from whence roſe this loue to CHRIST? Looke what the Apoſtle ſayeth, in the ſecond Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> in the fifth <hi>Chapter,</hi> and the fourteenth <hi>Verſ. The loue of CHRIST conſtraineth mee.</hi> Nowe, woulde to GOD that wee had the halfe of this loue! and if it were ſo, wee woulde haue little patience, to ſee thinges as they are, and to ſee the enemies of CHRIST IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS ſet vp the Altar of the Deuill, againſt the Altar of CHRIST: wee woulde not onelie make imprecations againſt the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, but wee woulde by all meanes hinder them: And this careleſneſſe which wee haue, teſtifieth, that wee loue not CHRIST: and if wee loue him not, an heauie judgement ſhall light vpon vs. Nowe therefore, ſeeing all grace is from the loue of CHRIST, the LORD fill our heartes with that loue; that wee may bee parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of grace heere, and heereafter bee glorified with CHRIST: To whome, with the Father, and the holie Spirite, bee all praiſe, honour, and glorie, for euermore. AMEN.</p>

                  </gap> ſee mee: and againe, yee ſhall ſee me</hi>: they vnderſtoode him not, nor wiſt not what hee ſpake. Nowe the Lord warneth them of his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in plaine ſpeaking, and hee ſayeth in plaine wordes, <hi>I am come out from the Father, and came into the world: againe, J leaue the world, and go to the Father.</hi> Nowe, Brethren, take heede, and yee ſhall marke a difference betwixt this fore-warning of the Diſciples, which is plaine and euident to their vnderſtanding, and the former fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warning, which was obſcure, and not plaine to their vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Before hee proponed the matter in plaine talke, hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poneth ſundrie conſolations, to prepare them againſt his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that they might heare of his departure the more gladlie: for it was an heauie thing for them to heare of his departure, with whome they were ſo well, and had ſuch joye, and ſuch intertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this earth. The Lord is verie loath, Brethren, to make the heartes of the Godlie ſadde: Hee is not onelie loath to make their heartes ſadde, and grieue them by death, by afflictions, and by croſſes: but hee is loath to ſpeake the worde that would grieue them: though it were but a worde to make them heauie, hee is loath to vtter it vnto them: and therefore, ere euer hee doe to them anie thing grieuous, ſadde, or heauie, the Lord vſeth to prepare their heartes to beare with it patientlie, and to furniſhe their heartes with comfort againſt croſſes and tribulations; that when perſecution, and affliction, and ſadde and heauie wordes ſhould come, they ſhould beare all thinges the more patientlie and gladlie. This is the Lordes cuſtome: So all men ſhould beware to grieue the heart of anie man, and chiefelie of the Godlie: I warne thee, bee loath to make the Godlie ſadde: rather we ſhould incline to make the heart of the miſerable creature joyfull, than ſadde. I ſee euer thorow <hi>Paul,</hi> in his writs, this illumination: hee euer inclineth to ſtirre vp the Godlie to rejoyce. Reade him, and yee ſhall ſee this: Ye haue a notable example of him in the <hi>2. Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians, Chap. 1. verſ. 23.</hi> they accuſe him verie ſharplie, <hi>that hee came not to them.</hi> Hee anſwereth them with a great atteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Nowe the LORDE beare witneſſe against my ſoule, that I woulde not come to you, to ſpare you.</hi> And in the next CHAPTER hee
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:16631:87"/>
ſayeth, <hi>That J ſhould not make you ſad,</hi> (for there was great matter of ſadneſſe amongſt the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> by reaſon of their euill beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,) <hi>for if I ſhould make you ſad, who is there to make mee to reioyce</hi>? So, in a word, we ſhould incline to make the heart of a ſinner joyfull: and if wee ſhould bee inforced to ſpeake ſad words, as oftentimes wee are, in this Countrey, by reaſon of the manifolde and groſſe ſinnes reigning in it, yet they ſhould bee throwne out of vs: Let them all bee in lenitie, that in the matter of ſadneſſe, they who heare them, may finde loue in them. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the Epiſtles to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> and to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> ſeemeth to bee ſharpe againſt them at the beginning, and progreſſe; but in the end of the Epiſtles, he vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth a marueilous loue to them, to raiſe vp their heartes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing.</p>
            <p>Now to marke the forme how he proponeth this ſad newes of his departure: Hee ſayeth not barely, I will goe my way: but firſt, <hi>I come downe from the Father,</hi> being equall with him in glory: <hi>And nowe I goe to him againe,</hi> to take vp my glory, which I had with him before all beginning: and it ſhall be for your good, that I goe my way to Heauen, to my Father, for I ſhall ſende you that Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. In telling them this, hee giueth them withall to vnderſtand, that they ſhall bee ſo farre from dammage and ſadneſſe, when the Lord ſhall goe his waye, that they ſhall rejoyce: for hee ſhall goe to Heauen, to the Father, and bee more buſie to doe them good, than when he was with them in the earth. So we learne here, a forme of proponing ſad newes vnto the godly: we ſhould propone them with ſuch a conuoy, that euen in ſad wordes wee ſhould preſent to the hearers ſome matter of joye: and in reproofe, loue and lenitie ſhould appeare. I will vſe a familiare example: now certainly we haue this day an occaſion to tell heauy tidings: and as Chriſt told to his Diſciples, that he was to depart ſhortly; ſo wee may tell, for ought wee ſee, the glorious tidinges of the Euangel is to depart: The Goſpel is to depart: there is ſad tidings: but howe ſhall I tell them in this forme that I haue ſaide, for the comfort of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie? The glorious Goſpel of Chriſt ſhall ſhortly depart, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude of this Land: there is ſad newes. But well is them who loueth Chriſt, and is ſad, and mourneth for his departure, for they ſhall rejoyce. And ſo on the contrary, woe is them who is not ſad at the departure of Ieſus Chriſt: and woe to them who loueth not this glorious Euangel: and woe to them who putteth it away, and are the authors thereof: Woe to the Noble men, and lords of this
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:16631:88"/>
Land: howbeit they bee leaping, through ſenſeleſſe ſecuritie, in their pride, yet their judgement was neuer ſo neare them: for pride goeth before deſtruction. Now thus much for the words of the Lord. In the words following we haue the anſwere of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples vnto the Lord: He hath ſpoken plainly to them, that <hi>hee will goe his way. Now,</hi> ſay they, <hi>thou ſpeakeſt plainly, &amp; thou ſpeakeſt no parable</hi>: thou ſpeakeſt plainly, that thou wilt goe thy waye, that any man may vnderſtand. This is the firſt part of the anſwere. They vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand nowe when hee ſpeaketh plainly: but they wiſt not what hee ſpake before, when he ſpake in parables. Well, Brethren, it is good to ſpeake of Chriſt, and of the waye to ſaluation plainly, that the pooreſt that heareth may vnderſtand. It is not enough that thou takeſt heed to deliuer ſound and true doctrine, but plain doctrine, and that this doctrine, which is ſound and true, bee ſpoken in ſuch words as beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth. Thou oughteſt not only to look that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bee ſound, but alſo to take heede to the words, as <hi>Paul, 1. Cor. 2. We ſpeake thoſe things that God hath gratified in Jeſus Chriſt, &amp; we ſpeak them not in humane words, but in powerful words of the Spirit.</hi> The Spirit hath ay his own mater: &amp; as the mater is heauenly, ſo the words muſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; of the Spirit: for as the Spirit hath his own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſo hath he his own words. The words muſt be euident &amp; plain, that the vnlearned may be capable of them. We haue many places of <hi>Paul</hi> agreeing to this: In that <hi>Chap. verſ. 4.</hi> going before, <hi>What was my language whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I came to you</hi>? ſaith he, <hi>it was not in humane eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but in ſpirituall power</hi>: that is, I ſpake ſo, that I made an oculare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration. And <hi>2. Cor. 3. verſ. 12. Hauing ſuch confidence, we ſpeak plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.</hi> And <hi>Chap. 4. verſ. 3. If this Goſpel bee hid, it is hid to them that periſh.</hi> So ſay I this day, if this Goſpel be hid, it is hid to them who goe to perdition: and thy perdition is ſealed vp, if thou ſeeſt not this light into thy ſoule, &amp; vnderſtandeſt it not. Into the <hi>3. Chap.</hi> to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> he ſaith, he preached ſo plainly, that in a manner hee cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Chriſt before their eyes: that is, hee made ſuch an oculare demonſtration of the crucified man Chriſt, that they might haue perceiued him, euen as he was crucified on the Croſſe. So ſay I, Brethren, as we ſhould ſtriue to ſinceritie of doctrine in the light, ſo wee ſhould ſtriue to deliuer it ſo euidently, and to tell it in ſuch plainneſſe, that it may be plaine to the moſt vnlearned: for it is no ſmall joye, that commeth to the heart of them who would faine vnderſtand and ſee that light, when they heare the word and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine deliuered plainly. And on the contrary, when the doctrine
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:16631:88"/>
is not plaine, it intangleth them who haue will to vnderſtand, and they get no joy thereof, but they are left in heauineſſe &amp; ſadneſſe. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>1. Cor. 14. verſ. 19. J had rather ſpeake fiue wordes with mine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, than ten thouſand in a ſtrange tongue, to none edification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I goe forward. In the next part of their anſwere, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe a wonderfull knowledge to be in the Lord, and that hee was the ſearcher of heartes: <hi>Nowe,</hi> ſay they, <hi>wee knowe that thou knoweſt all things, and needest not that any man ſhould aske thee.</hi> This they ſaide, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that in that parable which hee ſpake of before, <hi>Verſ. 16. A little while, and yee ſhall not ſee mee: and againe, a little while, and yee ſhall ſee mee</hi>; they wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t not what hee ſpake, but doubted amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: and they thought to aske at him, what was the meaning of it: Yet he preuented them, and tolde them that which they would haue asked at him: Thou not onely anſwereſt, ſay they, when thou art asked at; but alſo thou anſwereſt when none asketh at thee. What gather they of this? That hee is the ſearcher of the heartes of men and women: <hi>Wee belieue therefore,</hi> ſay they, <hi>that thou art come out from the Father</hi>: becauſe, ſay they, wee ſee thou art more than a man, thou knoweſt our mindes, and what is in our heartes, and that no man knoweth, and therefore of neceſsitie, thou muſt come from the Father.</p>
            <p>Wee haue to try a little, this faith of the Diſciples: it would ſeeme at the firſt face, to be a good faith, &amp; a good confeſsion they giue: but ſurely, will yee looke the anſwere of Chriſt, ſubjoyned in the next <hi>Verſ.</hi> yee ſhall finde it not to haue beene a firme and ſolide faith. They got little thanke for that faith. And if yee marke the ground of this faith, ye ſhall find it of little auaile. Indeede if they had ſaid thus, Becauſe thou telleſt vs thou came from the Father, we will belieue thee; it had bene better: but we belieue thee. Why? Becauſe thou haſt told vs, what was in our mindes and thoughts. So this faith is grounded more vpon a wonder, than on the words of Chriſt. This matter offereth vs large occaſion of ſpeaking, but I will be ſhort for the preſent. Wonders and miracles may well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare thee to belieue, and may confirme faith when it is gotten: but all the wonders in the world, cannot worke faith. All the works of God, both ordinarie, and extraordinarie, of his infinit wiſdome, power, and juſtice, woulde neuer make thine heart to ſettle on him, and belieue in him truelie, and if thou getteſt no more. The <hi>Gentiles</hi> in the worlde, before CHRIST came, they ſawe GOD, his power, wiſdome, juſtice, prouidence, &amp;c. by the workes of his
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:16631:89"/>
creation; yet they caſt him off, and belieued not. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayeth, <hi>1. Cor. Chap. 1. verſ. 21. Like as it pleaſeth not the world to know God, in the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God</hi>: that is to ſaye, in the creation, (a wonderfull and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite wiſedome,) <hi>it pleaſed God to ſaue them that belieue, by the fooliſhneſſe of preaching</hi>: for what is this word, and this preaching of the Croſſe of Ieſus Chriſt to the worlde, and to them that periſh, but a fooliſh and idle ſpeach? But what is it, that worketh faith in the heart of man and woman? None outward thing: no ſuch power as is vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in miracles: but it is the worde of the Croſſe of Chriſt, that worketh fayth, which illuminateth and openeth our heartes. Hee that was borne blind, <hi>Chap. 9. verſ. 1.</hi> thorowe the miracle of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his ſight, beganne indeede to thinke well and reuerently of Chriſt, but yet hee belieued not, till Chriſt inſtructed him by his word, ſaying, <hi>Belieuest thou in the Sonne of God</hi>?</p>
            <p>Now we come to Chriſtes anſwere: he refuteth this their faith, whereof they bragged ſo greatly: <hi>Doe yee belieue now?</hi> As hee would ſay, Yee thinke nowe, that yee haue faith enough, but yee deceiue your ſelues; for the time ſhall come, that ye ſhall all leaue me: how then can your faith bee ſure? Then marke heere: it is an vnſtable and vaniſhing faith that is grounded and leaneth on miracles: for ſuch a faith cannot abide the perſecution. Yea, I ſay farder, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it turneth to perſecution. Wee haue an example of this, <hi>Chap. 2. verſ. 23.</hi> where it is ſaid, <hi>Manie belieued in his Name, when they ſaw the wonders that hee wrought</hi>: but what followeth? Did Chriſt truſt to them? No, it is ſaide, hee would not commit himſelfe to them, becauſe hee knewe them well enough: hee knewe what was within them: they were not to truſt to. A queſtion may bee heere moued, whether if the faith of the Apoſtles was grounded on mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles only, or not? To this I anſwere: Their faith was not groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded onely on miracles, but alſo on the worde: their faith was not euaniſhing and temporall, but a true and juſtifying faith: for when Chriſt ſaide to his Diſciples, <hi>Whom ſay yee that I am? Peter,</hi> in the name of the reſt, <hi>anſwered, Thou art the Christ, the Sonne of the liuing God, Matth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 16. verſ. 16.</hi> But it is alſo true, that their faith was mixed with corruption, and earthly conceites: they truſted in him for ſome carnall reſpects: for ſo long as he was with them, they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in eaſe, they were ſubject to no croſſes, nor they ſawe no cauſe of ſorrowe or mourning: for when the Diſciples of <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> came to him, and asked him, <hi>why his Diſciples faſted not, as they and the Phariſees did</hi>? The Lord anſwered them, <hi>Howe can it bee, that the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

               </gap>ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, that their faith, for the moſte parte, was fleſhly, but this, that they had a peartneſſe, and boaſting of faith, it were ſufficient. In the <hi>26. Chap. of Matth. verſ. 33.34.</hi> when the Lord ſaith, <hi>Verilie, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilie, yee ſhall all bee offended in mee this night</hi>: what ſaieth <hi>Peter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> in the name of the reſt? <hi>Shall wee leaue thee? Wee ſhall die with thee.</hi> So hee, and the reſt, boaſteth of their faith. Well, ſayeth the Lord, <hi>Peter,</hi> thou boaſteſt now, remember that, <hi>ere the Cocke crow, thou ſhalt denie mee thriſe.</hi> So, though there were no more but this boaſting of faith, it teſtifieth, that their faith was more fleſhly, than ſpirituall: for worldly &amp; fleſhly confidence, is ay proude: ſo all this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence is with pride: but that ſpirituall faith and confidence, is aye with lowlineſſe. And, O how lowly a faithfull man will be! he will aye feare, and feele his owne weakneſſe. Hee that hath the greateſt faith in Chriſt Ieſus, hath the greateſt lowlineſſe and feare: for the greater the faith bee, hee will haue the greater ſenſe of his owne weakneſſe. Yee ſee howe <hi>Paul,</hi> in the <hi>11. Chap. to the Rom. verſ. 20.</hi> ſpeaking to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſaieth, <hi>Bee not proude, thou ſtandeth by fayth, ſtand with feare</hi>: where feare is not, there is no faith in Ieſus Chriſt: the man who hath a ſenſe of his owne weakneſſe, gripeth faſteſt to Chriſt. So yee reade of the man in the Euangel, when as the Lord ſaid vnto him, <hi>Belieueſt thou</hi>? He ſaith, <hi>J belieue, Lord, helpe mine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe.</hi> So hee or ſhee that belieueth in Chriſt, will haue a ſenſe of weakneſſe: for the power of God is aye with a feare and dread: dread, I ſaye, of their weakneſſe, leſt in this battell which wee haue againſt nature, nature preuaile ouer the Spirit. This is the nature of him or her who hath true faith in Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Marke the words, hee ſayth, <hi>Beholde, the houre commeth,</hi> and is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready come, <hi>that yee ſhall bee ſcattered euerie man to his owne, and ſhall leaue mee alone.</hi> Yee would maruell, hee was euen nowe comforting them, and nowe hee driueth them downe, and ſayeth to them, <hi>Yee ſhall leaue mee</hi>: that is, euery one of them ſhould depart from him, and ſeeke their owne ſhelter. This is great matter of dejectour. Brethren, looke howe needfull it is to raiſe vp an heart, which is caſten down, and to giue comfort to a comfortleſſe ſoule; as need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:16631:90"/>
is it to caſt downe the heart, which is puffed vp with vaine conceit: and if the proude heart bee caſten downe in mercy, it is for the weale of the creature: There is nothing more meete in this worlde, to prepare vs againſt the daye of triall, than the deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the ſoule: for heere the Lord is preparing his Diſciples againſt the day of affliction, that their faith ſhould be grounded, not on the workes, but on the words of Ieſus Chriſt. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more needfull, than to trie thy faith wel: and ay look down to thine heart, and looke well to this, that thy confidence riſe not on fleſh and blood. There are many, whoſe confidence leaneth on fleſh and blood, and on nature; thinking that they are ſtrong and ſtout. Take heede that thy confidence bee not on fleſh and blood, but on the Spirite of Ieſus Chriſt: and there is nothing better againſt the daye of perſecution, than to put a difference betwixt the motions of the fleſhe, and the motions of the Spirite; and the ſtrength of the fleſhe, and the ſtrength of the Spirite: For what was <hi>Peters</hi> bragging, but the ſtrength of the fleſh? For the ſtrength of the fleſh will beguile a good man. So, prepare thy ſelfe this way in trying thy ſelfe: for and if thou doeſt not this, thou ſhalt neuer willingly ſuffer: Yea, when thou ſhalt bee brought before the fire, then thou ſhalt ſtart abacke. Therefore, ſtriue aye to haue a ſenſe of the weakneſſe of thy nature. <hi>I will glorie in my weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> ſayeth <hi>Paul.</hi> There is none ſtrong in God, but they who are weake in themſelues. And if thou bee ſtrong in thy ſelfe, in fleſhe and bloode, thou haſt no ſtrength of GOD: and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe at one time or other, thou ſhalt fall. But when thou feeleſt thy weakneſſe, and ſigheſt and groneſt vnder the burthen there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, thou art ſtrong. Yee heare, that after <hi>Paul,</hi> ſeeking to be fred of his weakneſſe which hee felt, had gotten this anſwere, <hi>My ſhrength,</hi> ſayeth Chriſt, <hi>is perfected infirmitie. Then,</hi> ſayeth hee, <hi>I will glorie in mine infirmitie, 2. Corinth. 12. verſ. 9.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nowe in the next wordes, left it ſhould haue ſeemed grieuous to them, that they ſhould leaue him alone, hee ſubjoyneth, by waye of correction, <hi>But I am not alone: for the Father is with mee.</hi> The thing which riſeth of this, is plaine, and I propone it in as manie wordes: The LORD IESVS was neuer left himſelfe alone, euen when hee was in greateſt extreamitie, and when the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of death were vpon him, vpon the Croſſe, and when hee ſaide, <hi>My GOD, my GOD, why hast thou forſaken mee</hi>? His GOD had not left him. Indeede it is true, GOD kept him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:16631:90"/>
cloſe, for a time, and let the nature of man, in ſoule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, ſuffer all extreamitie: yet hee ceaſed not in the meane time, to holde vp that nature of man, vnder the infinite weight of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and wrath: or elſe, hee coulde not haue ſtoode, and borne out that burthen to the ende. Yet the LORD IESVS was left comfortleſſe on the Croſſe: and a verie Martyre, who ſuffereth for the trueth, will haue greater joye in ſuffering, than CHRIST had when he was on the Croſſe. This is true, looke to <hi>Paul,</hi> in the ſeconde Epiſtle to <hi>Timothie, Chap. 4. verſ. 16. and 17.</hi> Howbeit hee was in great trouble, yet the LORD gaue him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: <hi>In my defence,</hi> ſayeth hee, <hi>no man was with mee, but all againſt mee: GOD graunt it bee not layde to their charge: yet GOD was with mee, and ſtrengthened mee, and deliuered mee, and ſhall keepe mee till his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> So <hi>Paul</hi> had a wonderfull comfort, when hee was brought before the Tyrant <hi>Nero.</hi> The cauſe of this difference, is, The LORD IESVS was puniſhed for our ſinne, which he tooke vpon him: The Lord Ieſus was left comfortleſſe, becauſe the Lord puniſhed him for our ſinnes: When the Lord puniſheth, there is no conſolation. Will the Lord ſende on thee ſickneſſe, croſſes, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, &amp;c. to puniſh thee, and take vengeance on thee for ſinne, thou ſhalt haue no joye: but if hee be chaſtening thee, thou ſhalt haue joy. So the Lord Ieſus, becauſe he ſuffered for thy ſinne, had no conſolation, for he had the paines of Hell on him; and there is no joye in Hell, eſſay it when thou wilt. As for the Martyres, that which they ſuffer, is no puniſhment for ſinne: they ſuffer for the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of the trueth, and they haue a good conſcience: and the good conſcience will bring joye with it: for the Martyres will haue a greater joye, in extreame affliction, and exquiſite tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, than without affliction.</p>
            <p>Now in the laſt <hi>Verſ.</hi> hee concludeth this communing with his Diſciples, and theſe are his words, <hi>Theſe thinges haue J ſpoken vnto you, that in mee yee might haue peace.</hi> All tendeth to this ende, that yee maye enjoye that peace and reſt, that gladneſſe and joye thorowe the holie Spirite. This joye bringeth with it, a verie great eaſe and quietneſſe. Well, there are manie eaſes in the worlde: but neuer one wiſt what eaſe was in the ſoule, but hee who findeth this eaſe that is thorowe a good conſcience in CHRIST, and that peace which commeth of the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes.</p>
            <p>Woulde yee haue the true eſtate of a Chriſtian man, or vvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man? There it is in one word, That they are peaceable hearted, and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:16631:91"/>
they are joyfull hearted: The true Chriſtian man, hath the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfulleſt peace and joye in the ſoule, that can be. And this was the end of all the ſpeaking of the Lord Ieſus to his Diſciples: and this is the ende of the Goſpel, and of all our preaching, to haue a good conſcience, and that peace and reſt in the ſoule. Nowe they neuer knew what reſt and peace was, but they who knowe what it is to haue a ſore heart for ſinne; And, O howe ſore the conſcience will bee toſſed, when it hath the taſte of the judgement of God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that body would giue a thouſand worlds for a word of that peace: for what is the peace in Ieſus Chriſt? It is the beginning of Heauen: if thou beginneſt not that peace heere, thou ſhalt neuer ſee peace hereafter. And this is the ende of all our ſanctification, and juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, to get this peace in Chriſt. And what is Heauen? It is peace and reſt with God, that is our Heauen. So that if thou haue no peace and reſt in the ſoule, and neuer findeſt that true peace in Ieſus Chriſt, and that Spirit of joye, all this preaching is vaine to thee: all is vaine to thee, if thou getteſt not that peace. Take heed to it, as yee would ſee this life in Chriſt: and when thou heareſt of this worde of peace, looke thou preaſſe to goe home with a peaceable ſoule: and if thou canſt not get this peace, bee ſadde, and mourne for it, and thou ſhalt get it another time: Bee this wayes exerciſed, that thou mayeſt feele the fruites of this word.</p>
            <p>Nowe leſt they ſhould thinke, that this peace which hee promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them, ſhould want ſorrow, and that they ſhould neuer be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, he putteth this out of their mind, and ſayeth, <hi>In the worlde yee ſhall haue affliction</hi>: your peace ſhall be without peace: The reſt of a Chriſtian, is no reſt: your joye ſhall bee with ſadneſſe, and your comfort with heauineſſe: inwardly yee ſhall haue joye, but out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly ye ſhall haue heauineſſe. This heauineſſe which the godlie haue, is ſo farre from that, that it taketh away their pleaſure, that their joye riſeth of tribulation: and then they haue greateſt joye, when they are ſoreſt vexed, and in greateſt tribulations. Take heed to it, came not the ſame to paſſe in the Diſciples? they had neuer ſuch a joye, as they had then, when as ſoone after Chriſt depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and was glorified in the Heauens, they were brought in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Councill, and ſcourged for the Name of Ieſus Chriſt, and commanded ſtraitly, that they ſhould neuer ſpeake in the Name of Ieſus: then they went out with joye, that they were counted worthie to ſuffer for that Name: They had not ſuch ioye all the time that they were with Chriſt in the world.</p>

The Lord Ieſus is the only Conquerour, and he it is, that is only victorious, and hath ouercome the worlde and the Deuil. But as for vs his members, (<hi>1. Epiſt. Iohn, Chap. 5. verſ. 4.</hi>) this is the victory that hath ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come this worlde, euen our fayth. Faſten thee on him who hath gotten the victory, and then the Battell is perfected. To ſpeake it properly, we haue not a battell with the Deuill, to get the victory; but to keepe Chriſt by fayth: for the Deuill, and all our enemies, are ouercome, and the battell is ſtricken, and the fielde is wonne. Chriſt ſitting on the Croſſe, vanquiſhed the Deuil, and tooke him, and ledde him captiue in a triumph: all the Deuils are reſerued in chaines to that great day: So we haue not a battell, for the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie is wonne already: but all our victory is to keepe fayth in him, who hath ouercome our enemies, and purchaſed the victory to vs: and all the battels of the Deuill, are to twin vs and Chriſt: and all the battels wee haue with him, are about fayth: for if the Deuill be able to twin vs and this fayth, we haue done with Chriſt: and therefore al the exhortations of the Apoſtles, are to ſtand in faith. Looke the <hi>6. Chap.</hi> to the <hi>Epheſians.</hi> What then ſhould I exhort you to? or what ſhoulde bee our exhortations to them who are fighting?

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE heard (Welbeloued in the Lord Ieſus Chriſt) the large Sermon which the Lord hath to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, from the beginning of the fourteenth <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of this Goſpel, to this preſent <hi>Chap.</hi> which is the ſeuenteenth. Now in the ſeuenteenth <hi>Chap.</hi> he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his Sermon, with an earneſt Prayer to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For the better vnderſtanding of this Prayer, wee haue to know thus farre, The Lord Ieſus, when he was in this world, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in the fleſhe, abiding amongſt the Iewes, and conuerſant with his Diſciples; he abode amongſt them as an high Prieſt: that eternall high Prieſt, of whome all the high Prieſtes amongſt the Iewes, before his comming, were onely but types and figures: and when he came, he put an end to all the types, being the very bodie it ſelfe. Nowe as it became the high Prieſt to make interceſſion for the people; ſo he being high Prieſt, made interceſsion for his own people. The interceſsion which the Lord made for his owne, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in two points; to wit, in prayer, and in offering vp of a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. Then, as for the firſt part of this interceſsion, when the Lord was in the world, he prayed continually for the people; hee neuer ceaſed night nor daye from prayer. As for the other part of his interceſsion, when he had bene in the world awhile, at the laſt hee offereth vp that ſweete Sacrifice of his owne body to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and ſo hee putteth an ende to all thoſe ſacrifices, which were but types of him the true Sacrifice. As for the Prayers whereby the Lord interceded betwixt God and man, they were manie, and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:16631:92"/>
made at ſundry times: But amongſt all the reſt, it may bee eaſilie ſeene, that this prayer in this <hi>Chapter</hi> was one of the moſte excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and ſo it hath pleaſed the holy Spirite to regiſter this Prayer eſpecially, and to recommend it to the poſteritie, to the end of the worlde. Firſt, this Prayer is no able, in reſpect of the time in the which hee made it: it was euen about that time, when hee offered himſelfe vp to the Father. Next, in reſpect of the vſe, it is notable, becauſe by this prayer he did conſecrate and dedicate that bleſſed Sacrifice to the Father: for ſacrifices were dedicated to Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> by prayer. Thirdly, in reſpect of the ſubject and matter of it: for as ye may ſee in the <hi>Chapter</hi> it ſelfe, firſt the Lord prayeth for himſelfe, and for that eternall glory which he had with the Father from all eternity: the faireſt thing, and the greateſt matter that euer was, was that which hee prayed for: and this hee doeth in the firſt fiue <hi>Verſes.</hi> Then he commeth on, and prayeth for his Diſciples, which he ſhould leaue behinde him in the worlde, that the Lord would take the cuſtody of them, after his Aſcenſion vnto the Heauens, and would preſerue them from all perill: and this hee doeth from the fifth <hi>Verſe,</hi> to the twenty: And laſt, hee prayeth for the whole Kirke, for life euerlaſting, and juſtification: and this he doeth to the ende of this <hi>Chapter</hi>: So yee s;ee, it is a notable ſubiect. Laſt of all, will ye looke to the force of this Prayer, yee ſhall ſee the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of it: The force was not for the preſent, or for a time; but the force of it abideth continually, to the ende of the worlde. And this ſame Prayer is a meane, whereby all men and women, who are ſafe, and ſhall bee ſafe, to the ende of the world, obtaine ſaluation: And ſo this Prayer may bee well called, A ground, wherevpon the Kirke ſtandeth. And as our ſaluation ſtandeth on the Sacrifice of Ieſus Chriſt, ſo it ſtandeth on that Prayer that was offered to his Father.</p>
            <p>But to come to the Text, <hi>When Jeſus</hi> (ſayeth <hi>John</hi> the writer of the Goſpel) <hi>had ſpoken theſe thinges, hee lifted vp his eyes to the Heauen,</hi> and he ſaid as followeth. This is the entrie to the Prayer, wherein <hi>Iohn</hi> firſt concludeth the Sermon which the Lord made to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: <hi>When Ieſus had ſpoken theſe thinges to his Diſciples.</hi> Then hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poneth the Prayer that followeth, <hi>Hee lifted vp his eyes to Heauen, and ſaid.</hi> There is the propoſition of the Prayer. In the propoſition he noteth narrowly the behauiour of Chriſt in his Prayer: <hi>Hee lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vp his eyes to Heauen.</hi> So in the eleuenth <hi>Chapter</hi> of this Goſpel, he noteth this behauiour in praying, when hee thanketh his Father,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:16631:93"/>
that he heard him: before he raiſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the dead, he lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vp his eyes to Heauen.</p>
            <p>Nowe, Brethren, to ſpeake of geſture in Prayer, it needeth not much: will ye reade the Scriptures, yee ſhall reade theſe geſtures to bee in prayer: Firſt, Godly men haue humbled themſelues before that Majeſty: (It becommeth the beſt of vs all to bow vs before God:) They ſignified by the bowing of their knees, the humbling of the heart. Offer not, if ye haue a proude heart, to come before that Throne. Then they were wont to haue their handes, and their eyes, lift vp to the Heauens; that ſignified the lifting vp of the eye of the ſoule to God, to looke to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to ſee him thorowe all theſe cloudes, and theſe viſible heauens, to come to that light that hath none acceſſe: and this agreeth with the other. There are many who ſhall ſee Heauen, but with an humbled heart: when the heart is humbled, and brought lowe, then it is conuoyed thorowe theſe heauens, euen to that light of God. It becommeth all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to bee humbled on their knees, and to lift vp their eyes to Heauen: but all ſtandeth in the heart. What recks of the outward diſpoſition, if the ſoule be not heauenly diſpoſed? If it haue a ſenſe of Heauen, then the outwarde geſture will followe, then wee will bowe our knees, and humble vs before that Maieſty. An humbled heart will fall downe, but a proude ſinner, who is not touched with a ſenſe of his ſinnes, will hardly bow his knee.</p>
            <p>Nowe wee come to the Prayer: firſt hee maketh his petition for himſelfe: and why not? the moſt precious thing in the worlde is the glory of Ieſus Chriſt: Hee ſayeth, <hi>Father, glorifie thy Sonne.</hi> There is his petition. Marke the ſtyle: it is a very warme and hearty ſtile that he giueth him, ſpeaking familiarly to God: the heart of him warmeth ſweetly with him, and as a Sonne, he calleth him Father. The ſtile which he giueth him, vttereth, that he had a ſenſe of that fatherly loue and affection towards him. While as he nameth him Father, hee vttereth that Sonly affection and loue that hee bare to him: A Sonly loue, craueth a Fatherly loue, and conciliateth a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly affection from Heauen. Why ſhould we not ſtriue to be like the Lord Ieſus, and in Prayer chiefly? Woulde any man or woman finde the Fatherly affection of God? Would they haue that loue that Fathers beare to their Children? Let them vtter in Prayer that affection that a Sonne or a Daughter ſhoulde haue to their Father. If thou wouldeſt haue the Fatherly loue of God, (the ſweeteſt thing in the worlde,) looke that the Names which thou
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:16631:93"/>
glueſt him, teſtifie, that thou loueſt him, as a deare Childe loueth his Parentes: and looke aye wee pray with that Spirite, which is the Spirite of Adoption, that teſtifieth to our ſoules, that wee are adopted to bee the Sonnes and Daughters of God: for it is that Spirite, that giueth libertie to the heart, and openeth the mouth, and cauſeth thee (as the Apoſtle ſayeth,) to crie, Abba, Father. And if thou haue not this holie Spirite of Adoption, and if that Spirite open not thine heart, and lowſe thy tongue, call him Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as thou wilt, hee is nothing elſe to thee, but a terrible Iudge, to take vengeance on thee, and thou art nothing els but a ſlaue to him, and not a Sonne. Looke aye therefore, that thou haue that Spirite, that ſhall teſtifie to thee, that thou art not the childe of wrath, but that thou art bought with the blood of Ieſus Chriſt: and when thou feeleſt that Spirite within thee, thou ſhalt finde moſt ſweete and comfortable motions, yea, motion vpon motion riſing in thine heart.</p>
            <p>As hee calleth him Father, ſo hee calleth himſelfe his Sonne: hee ſayeth not, Father, glorifie mee: but, <hi>Father, glorifie thy Sonne.</hi> Euen as the firſt ſtile conciliateth the loue of the Father to the Sonne, ſo this ſtile reconciliateth the loue of the Sonne to the Father. So, Brethren, let all the ſtiles wee vſe in prayer to God, ſauour of the loue we haue to God: whether wee name God, or call him Father, let that ſtile ſmell of that ſonly loue we beare to God: or whether wee ſtile our ſelues to God, let that ſtile ſhew the loue wee beare to God: and then, when theſe two affections meete, our affection going vp to him to the Heauens, and his ſweete affection com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming downe to vs, there is the tendereſt and ſweeteſt meeting that euer was: and bee aſſured, and if it were but a little affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that thou beareſt towardes him, hee will meete it with an infinite loue: yea, hee will ſende downe, out of the Heauens, by his holie Spirite, ſuch loue to thy ſoule, as the tongue of no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can expreſſe. Haue yee not experience of this, that the loue that the <hi>LORD</hi> beareth to vs, in <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRJST,</hi> is the ſweetest thing that euer was? The <hi>LORD</hi> hath giuen vs leaue to bee homelie with him through <hi>CHRIST</hi>: and they who want <hi>CHRJST,</hi> dare not bee homelie. The Pagans and the Iewes, who denie the <hi>LORD JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> haue not this familiaritie with <hi>GOD.</hi> Through <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi> wee haue this wonderfull libertie to come to <hi>GOD,</hi> and call him Father.</p>
            <p>But to come to the matter: <hi>Father,</hi> ſayeth hee, <hi>glorifie thy Sonne.</hi>

               </gap>n, what is it that he ſeeketh of the Father? He ſeeketh glorie: He hath bene humbled exceedingly, and layde downe: the tongue of man nor Angell cannot tell howe lowe the Lord was layde, ſo being humbled at the pleaſure of the Father: nowe when hee hath neare finiſhed the worke which hee ſhould haue done, hee ſeeketh againe his owne glory, and good reaſon were: he ſayth, <hi>Glorifie me, Father,</hi> with that glory which I had with thee from all eternitie. The Sonne with the Father ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> equall glorie. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Philippians, Chap. 2. verſ 6.7.8.9.</hi> hath a notable place to this purpoſe, and hee pointeth out three thinges of Chriſt in that place: Firſt, hee letteth vs ſee the glorie which hee ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> before hee came into the world: Secondly, he letteth vs ſee how hee humbled himſelfe to the Father: And thirdly, hee letteth vs ſee how hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered againe that glory which hee ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> from all eternity: as comfortable a place of Ieſus Chriſt, as is in all the Scripture. This then was his glory, when as hee was in the forme of God, hee thought it no robbery ſo to be equall with God, for he was equall with his Father in glory in all reſpects. Then hee telleth vs of his humiliation, But he himſelfe, of his free will, made himſelfe of no reputation. At the will of the Father, the Sonne of God commeth downe from the Heauen, and layeth downe that glory, and taketh vpon him the vile habite of a ſeruant: the habit of man, that is the next degree: and being in the habit of man, he is made obedient to the death, the vildeſt death that could bee, an accurſed death, the death of the Croſſe: &amp; this was all done at the pleaſure of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Laſt, he commeth to the recouery of this glory, God exalted him in a wonderfull ſublimenes &amp; highnes, &amp; he gaue him a name aboue all names, that at the Name of IESVS all knees ſhould bee bowed, of all things in Heauen, and in earth, and vnder the earth, and that all tongues ſhould confeſſe that IESVS was the Lord, to the glory of the Father. In the firſt to the <hi>Epheſ.</hi> alſo hee ſpeaketh of this his glory, ſaying, He raiſed him vp from the dead, he placed him at his right hand in the Heauens, farre aboue all empire, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality, and power, and he ſubjected all things vnder his feet, and hee made him head ouer all, euen ouer the Kirke it ſelfe. Whoſe heart is able to tell the glory that the Lord Ieſus, who was ſo farre humbled, got after his humiliation? I recommend often theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to you: for if we loue our Sauior, it ſhould be our joy to reade of the glory and exaltation of him, which he hath in our fleſh: for his glory, is our glory: and as he was exalted, ſo ſhall we be. What
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:16631:94"/>
glory is this which he ſeeketh? The Lord Ieſus is very God &amp; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man. Now whether ſeekes he the glory of the Godhead, which dwelt in him bodily, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Col. 2. verſ. 9.</hi> or the glory of the humane nature, or the glorie of them both? The anſwere is eaſie: The Lord Ieſus is that eternall high Prieſt, and Mediatour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and man: And as hee is Mediatour, being both God and man, no doubt, he ſeeketh at the Father, the glorifying of both the natures: The glorifying of the Sonne of God, as he was equall with the Father, to be reſtored to him againe: and the glorifying of the humane nature, to be giuen him of new, which hee had not afore: but principally the glory of the Godhead, <hi>Glorifie mee with that glorie,</hi> ſaieth hee, <hi>which J had with thee from all eternitie.</hi> So chiefely hee ſeeketh the glory of the Sonne of God, that glory he had from all eternity: for why? As yee heard, <hi>Philipp. 2.6.</hi> the Sonne of God had paſſed farre, and layde downe that glory which hee had with the Father: therefore Ieſus ſought the glory of the Godhead. As for the glory of the manhood, it is but the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the other. What is the glory of the manhood, vnto the glory of the great God? The glory of the nature of man in Chriſt, is nothing but the beames of that glory which commeth from the Godhead. The glory of the nature of man in Ieſus Chriſt, howbeit it paſſeth all the glory of Angels and man, is nothing in reſpect of that glory of God, which dwelleth in Ieſus Chriſt. To tell this more plainely, wee ſee howe the glory of God vttered it ſelfe in Chriſt, when that bleſſed body was in the graue, and when hee was lying earthed cloſed in a Tombe, then that glorious God begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to vtter himſelfe: for God left him neuer, but kept him ſtill in the graue, that he corrupted not: and the firſt thing hee doeth, hee raiſeth vp the dead bodie out of the graue: and when hee rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that bodie, hee carrieth it vp to the Heauens, and ſetteth it at the right hand of the Father, &amp; that glorious Godhead ſhal vtter it ſelfe in conuoying that bodie, at the terrible day of judgement, and ſhall ſet down that man Chriſt in the aire, as a Iudge, to judge both the quicke and the dead. As in the firſt to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> hee declared that he was the Sonne of God mightilie, in that hee roſe from the dead. So that Godhead declared it ſelfe, that it left him not after this life was exſpired, but raiſed him from corruption.</p>
            <p>Then hee commeth to his argumentes to mooue his Father: the firſt is, <hi>Father, the houre is come,</hi> therefore, Father, glorifie thy Sonne, the houre of death appointed from all eternitie, that I ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:16631:95"/>
vp the Sacrifice for the redemption of man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeeing this death approacheth neare, let glorie follow that ignominious death: my death will bee verie offenſiue, both to the multitude, and to my Diſciples: as hee ſaide, <hi>This night yee will all bee offended at mee</hi>: and, as hee would ſay, O my Father, leaue mee not in that ignominious death: but out of death, raiſe mee to glorie. Chriſt Ieſus, all the time that hee was in the worlde, the onlie thing which he ſought, was the glorie of Heauen: for our life ſtandeth in that Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: <hi>And if CHRIST had not beene rayſed,</hi> ſayeth <hi>Paul, all our preaching ſhould bee in vaine, and yee ſhould lie ſtill in your ſinnes.</hi> So, during all the time that hee was in this worlde, this was aye his prayer to his Father: and chiefelie, when hee ſawe the houre of death, hee was inſtant and earneſt in ſeeking that glorie, Wee may learne heere a leſſon: The nearer and the nearer wee are to death, (deceiue not our ſelues, with a falſe life,) the more earneſt wee ſhould bee with <hi>GOD,</hi> that hee would giue vs life: and men and women, as they growe in age and drawe nearer death, they ſhould bee the more inſtant to ſeeke life: and when they growe to graye haires, (it is a great ſhame to ſee an olde bodie prophane,) they ſhould prepare themſelues for the houre of death: for death is a dangerous thing, death is not to bee jeſted with. All men will ſay, I will die: but if thou dieſt once, woe is to thee, if thou get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt not life: for why? death is a port, whereby wee either paſſe to that euerlaſting death, or then to euerlaſting life: Looke for no Purgatorie: when as the ſoule is looſed from the bodie, it ſeeth an horrible darkneſſe, if in this preſent life it had not a fore-taſting of a better life. Therefore during the time of grace, when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

So, during this life heere, wee ſhoulde aye groane to feele that life, and faſten heart and hande to finde that life: but then chiefely, when we are drawing neare the doore of death: and daylie we gette manie warnings to flitte, and remooue out of this life: And the Lord ſayeth by theſe ſickneſſes and calamities, Flitte,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:16631:95"/>
flit: but then greedily wee ſhould gripe to Ieſus Chriſt, and faſten to him, who is life: and if wee gette a gripe of him, that death, which is terrible otherwayes, it will bee turned to a ſweet ſleepe. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayeth, <hi>Thoſe who ſleepe in him, he ſhall rayſe them vp</hi>: there death is but a ſweete ſleepe. Woe to them that haue no gripe of Chriſt! for at the laſt houre death ſhall bee terrible vnto them. Euen as I beganne, ſo I ende: Thinke not lightlie of death: and if thou beſtoweſt thy life, looke that thou beſtowe it well, and for a good cauſe: and if thou flitteſt, and if thou changeſt this houſe of claye, bee ſure that thou gette a better: and if this tabernacle of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die bee diſſolued, bee thou aſſured in thy ſoule, that thou ſhalt bee cloathed with the glorie of Ieſus Chriſt. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the ſeconde <hi>Epiſt.</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and the fifth <hi>Chapter,</hi> was ſure of this, after the diſſolution of his bodie from the ſoule: when as hee ſayeth, <hi>I knowe perfectlie, if once the earthlie houſe of this tabernacle were diſſolued, I ſhall gette a lodging, not made with the handes of men, but eternall in the Heauens.</hi> Before yee flitte out of an houſe heere, yee will bee ſure of another to dwell in. O foole! art thou ſo wiſe in the thinges of this worlde, and art not ſure to bee cloathed with that buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Heauens? Therefore, before thou loſeſt this life, ſee howe thou beſtoweſt it, and ſee that thou dieſt in a good cauſe, and looke that thou haue a gripe of Ieſus Chriſt: and if thou wouldeſt die, giue this life to him, who is able to giue thee a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter life. And ſeeing the time of triall draweth neare, for ought we ſee, and the time will declare, who will die with Ieſus Chriſt, and offer their liues vp to him, the Lord giue euerie one of vs grace to die for Ieſus Chriſt: and ſaye in thy ſelfe, Lord, if it ſhall pleaſe thee to bring on that triall, prepare mee to giue thee this life, which thou haſt giuen mee; for I knowe aſſuredlie, that I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue a better of thee. Well is the ſoule which is this wayes prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red! And well is them who die for the cauſe of Ieſus Chriſt, for this glorious Goſpel! And woe is them who die in the contrarie parte!</p>
            <p>The ſecond argument is, <hi>That thy Sonne may glorifie thee alſo.</hi> This is the reaſon: If thou glorifie mee, Father, I ſhall glorifie thee: for the knowledge of thee ſtandeth in the knowledge of mee: if the worlde ſee not mee, they cannot glorifie thee. If the creature ſee not the glorie of the Sonne, hee will neuer ſee the Father. Yee ſee a ſweete meeting heere, betwixt the Father and the Sonne: howe
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:16631:96"/>
euerie one of them joyneth together in glorie: the Father, who is the Fountaine of all glorie, beginneth, and communicateth his glorie, with the Sonne and the holie Spirite: the Father hath not his glorie of them, but he beginneth, and communicateth his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie with the Sonne and the holie Spirit: &amp; the glorie of the Sonne and the holie Spirit, redoundeth backe againe to the Father. And that glorious Trinitie deliteth in glorifying one another: for the glorie commeth from the Father, vpon the Sonne, and from the Sonne, to the holie Spirit: and back againe, from the holie Ghoſt to the Sonne, &amp; from the Sonne to the Father: euen as the Sunne maketh reflexe from a mirrour towardes himſelfe againe. No words are able to expreſſe this, for it is a thing incomprehenſible to ſee that glorie betwixt the Father, the Sonne, and the holie Ghoſt. The conſideration of this woulde confounde all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, both men and Angels; howe the Father putteth on the beames of his glorie vpon the Sonne, and from the Sonne to the holie Spirit: and then it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth about from the holie Spirit, and ſtriketh on the Son, &amp; on the Father. Of this we are not capable, nor no Angel can ſufficientlie conſider the deepnes of this glorie: yet wee may knowe, that all glorie commeth of the Father, and paſſeth on the Sonne, and on the holie Spirit: and, as it were, in a circle, the beames of that glorie commeth backe againe, glancing on the Father: and the glorie of the Father is not diminiſhed, but euer hee remaineth infinitelie glorious: and the Sonne, and the holie Spirite, are nothing inferiour in power, majeſtie, or glorie, vnto the Father: for they differ nothing, except in order: The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is firſt, and the Sonne is the ſeconde perſon of the glorious Trinitie, begotten of the Father: and the bleſſed holie Spirite, the thirde perſon, proceedeth of the Father, and the Sonne, all alike glorious. Nowe I will leaue this: There is euen ſuch a meeting betwixt God and man, in a manner: for all the glorie which wee haue, commeth of the Father: for what is the glory of a King, but a little ſmall beame of that infinite glorie? So the glorie of the creature redoundeth to God. Looke to the Heauen, and to the Earth; there is great glorie in them: yet the glorie of them ſhall all come to him againe: and Heauen and Earth ſhall periſh, ere he want a jote of his glorie. <hi>Rom. 11. By him, thorow him, and to him, are all thinges.</hi> So that to him redoundeth all glorie: in ende all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth home againe till him, as in a circle.</p>

If anie man hath gotten a ſparke of that glorie, let him not thinke, that that glorie ſhall onelie come backe againe to God, but let him bee the conuoyer of it: and let him ſay, yea, if he bee a King, who hath gotten a Crowne, Lord, I wil take this Crowne, and with as good will as thou haſt giuen it to mee, will I giue it to thee againe: for wee haue nothing but that which commeth from this God: And ſo, if thou hadſt nothing but this life, ſay, Now, Lord, with as good will as I gotte it, with as good will, will I render it to thee: otherwayes hee will bee glorified in thee whatſoeuer thou doeſt, doe what thou canſt; but thy life ſhall bee turned into death, and thine honour into ſhame and ignominie. Therefore, whenſoeuer it pleaſeth him to ſeeke our liues, euen with heart and good will we ſhould render them vnto him: for if he take them from vs, he will giue vs life euerlaſting: and if hee take a Crowne from a King, hee will giue him the Crowne of life euerlaſting. And if hee take this worldly riches from thee, hee will giue thee that rich treaſure of glory in Ieſus Chriſt: and ſo with all other worldly things: but if we giue them not with good will, he will take them from vs, &amp; wil giue them to others, and we ſhall get ſhame and ignominie. So, in deſpite of thine heart, God ſhall be glorified, in whatſoeuer thing hee beſtoweth on thee. Therefore let euery one of vs, whatſoeuer wee receiue of God, bee ſo diſpoſed, that if it pleaſe God to haue our life, riches, or whatſoeuer commodities of this world, we ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all vnto God willingly: as <hi>Job</hi> ſaieth, <hi>The Lord giueth, the Lord taketh, bleſſed bee the Name of the Lord.</hi> As hee would ſay, I haue got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten all from thee, and I will giue all to thee againe. What got <hi>Iob</hi> for rendring all to the Lord? He gaue him the double. Euen ſo, thou ſhalt get the double. Nowe the Lord prepare vs to offer vp this life willingly vnto him, and to ſpende it thankfully for his glory and ſeruice, being aſſured, that wee ſhall gette a better life layde vp in the Heauens for vs, through <hi>IES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi>: To whom, with the <hi>FATHER,</hi> and the holie <hi>SPIRIT,</hi> bee all Prayſe, Honour, and Glorie, world without ende.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE ſhewed you the laſt daye, (Welbeloued in the Lord Ieſus Chriſt) that this Prayer which the Lord made to his Diſciples before his death, ſtandeth in three parts: Firſt hee prayeth for himſelfe, and his owne glory: Secondly, he prayeth for his Apoſtles, and for their preſeruation: Laſt, he prayeth for the whole Faythfull, the whole Kirke that ſhould bee on the face of the earth, to the ende of the worlde. The laſt day we entered into the firſt part. His petition in the firſt part, was <hi>Father, glorifie thy Sonne.</hi> The firſt argument of his petition, was <hi>The houre is at hande</hi>: that is to ſaye, The houre of my death is at hande, therefore it is time that I ſhould be glorified: Let mee not lie for euer, would hee he ſay, in that terrible, and ignominious, and offenſiue death; but after the death, after that ſhame and ignominie, that I ſhall ſuffer, immediately glorifie me.</p>
            <p>Then the next argument was, <hi>Glorifie thy Sonne, Father, that thy Sonne may glorifie thee.</hi> I ſhall glorifie thee againe, would hee ſaye, and in mine exaltation, and glorifying me, thou ſhalt be glorified, and ſo the whole glory ſhall redounde to thee: therefore, Father, glorifie me. In this Text which wee haue nowe read, followeth the thirde reaſon of his petition, why hee desireth that the Father ſhould glorifie him: The thirde reaſon is, <hi>That I may giue life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting to them that thou haſt giuen to mee.</hi> As he would ſay, Father, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:16631:97"/>
mee, and I ſhall giue life euerlaſting to thy Choſen: it ſhall not bee for nothing, but as my glory ſhall redounde to thy glory, ſo it ſhall redounde to the ſaluation of thy Choſen, to the ende of the world. Ere he come to the argument, he layeth downe the ground of it, which is, the authority that the Father had giuen to him: <hi>Thou haſt giuen mee authoritie ouer all fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſh,</hi> ſayth the Lord. This ground of the gift of life euerlaſting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is a power and authority, which the Father hath giuen to the Sonne. Whoſoeuer giueth life, hee muſt haue a great authority, and a greater than all this earth hath. All the Kings in the worlde haue not authority to giue life to a gnat. Indeede the authority of a King may take away the life: but they haue no power, no if it were but to giue this life naturall, let bee life euerlaſting: And ſo that power muſt be great, to giue life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting. So this Princely and Kingly authority, the Lord Ieſus hath receiued of his Father: Ye know his offices, his Kingly office, his Prieſtly and Propheticall office: Life euerlaſting, and the gift of it, is grounded on that Kingly authority which the Lord hath gotten from his Father. But howe farre extendeth it? <hi>Thou haſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen mee authoritie ouer all fleſh.</hi> Neuer man, nor woman, is exempted from the Kingly power of Ieſus Chriſt, whether they be choſen or reprobate. Looke the fifth <hi>Chapter</hi> of this Goſpel, <hi>The Father hath giuen the Sonne all authoritie and judgement, and by him doeth adjudge to life the choſen, and to death the reprobate</hi>: So there is neuer a ſoule exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from his judgement. The Lord himſelfe in the <hi>28. Chapter</hi> of <hi>Matth. verſ. 18.</hi> hee extendeth his authority larger: <hi>The Father,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>hath giuen mee all authoritie in Heauen and in Earth.</hi> So that Ieſus Chriſt hath not only authority ouer man and woman, but ouer the Angels in Heauen: he hath power ouer them all, and ouer the Deuils, and <hi>at the Name of IES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S, all knees muſt bow, of things Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie and Earthlie</hi>; if they bow not, they ſhall bee broken. I ſhall tell you more, which is very comfortable: This authority which the Lord hath gotten in Heauen, and in Earth, is not as he is God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie: (bowbeit principally it be as he is God:) but this power that hee hath gotten ouer the Angels, is euen as hee is man: howbeit they bee glorious, and farre more glorious that men, yet they are not ſo glorious, as the man the Lord Ieſus. So, I ſaye, euen as he is man, he is head and King of the Angels. Looke the <hi>5. Chapter</hi> of <hi>Iohn, verſ. 27.</hi> The Father hath giuen the Sonne all authoritie and judgement, as he is the Sonne of man: not onely hath hee this power as he is God, but euen that nature of ours wherewith he is
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:16631:98"/>
clad, hath this power. It is a worthie thing to bee marked, what the Lord gathereth of this authoritie. In the <hi>28. Chap.</hi> of <hi>Matth. verſ. 18. The Father hath giuen mee all authoritie in Heauen and Earth: The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fore goe out,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and preach, and baptize all Nations, in the Name of the Father, of the Son, and of the holie Ghoſt.</hi> So ye ſee, on that princelie authoritie which the Sonne hath, he ſendeth out his Diſciples to preach: And all that the Apoſtles did in the worlde, in preaching and baptizing, they did it on the authoritie of Chriſt Ieſus their Lord. There was neuer an Ambaſſadour, that went with ſuch a power, as the Apoſtles of Ieſus Chriſt had in the world. And, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, to come to our ſelues, I ſay, euen this day, all this preaching of the Goſpel, and all this miniſtring of the Sacraments, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, all proceedeth of this princely and kingly authority of the Lord Ieſus. Marke it: The cloſing vp of Heauen, and the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vp of Heauen to penitent ſinners, whether it bee by word or diſcipline, all is grounded on an higher authoritie, than all the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the worlde. There was neuer a King or Prince that had ſo great authoritie as this, whereon the Diſcipline, according to the worde of <hi>GOD,</hi> and exerciſe of Religion, is grounded. And they who contemne this preaching of the Goſpel, and miniſtring of the sacramentes, and Diſcipline, they contemne not the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of man, (it were better for them to contemne all the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of Kinges,) but they contemne the authoritie of the great <hi>GOD</hi>: for in the Kirke, there is none authoritie, but Chriſtes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie; and all that is done, is founded on this au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hority. We ſay not on the authority of Kings, or of the Pope. The Lord hath not tranſlated this authority to any creature: and therefore the Pope hath but an vſurped authority. As for the Miniſter, he hath no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in his own perſon, but onlie in the Lord Ieſus. And this is the difference, betwixt the Kirke and the Policie, The Lord Ieſus hath giuen a part of his authority, to the King, or to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate: but the Lord Ieſus hath not giuen any part of his authoritie, to any of the Kirke. In the Policie, there are Kinges; but in the Kirke, there is none, but the Lord Ieſus. And all that tyrannie, in the kingdome of the Antichriſt, is but vſurped: there is not a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute of the word of <hi>GOD,</hi> that can be a ground to it.</p>
            <p>When he hath layde downe the ground of life, hee telleth who will get this life. Will euery one get this life? No, no, neuer one getteth this life from him, but the ſoule that the Father hath pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out of this world, and put into his hand, The Lord will know
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:16631:98"/>
well, to whom he will giue this life euerlaſting. It may be, he will throw a Kingdome to a man, and giue him theſe earthly things in great aboundance: but hee will not giue to euery one the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heauen. If ye will weigh the words, ye ſhall ſee diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, the part of the Father, and of the Sonne, in the worke of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: The Father giueth men to the Sonne, that is the part of the Father: <hi>J will giue them life euerlasting,</hi> that is the part of the sonne. Firſt the Father of the Lord Ieſus, chooſed out ſo manie, as hee would haue ſafe, in his Sonne Chriſt Ieſus: and then in time, hee calleth on them, whome hee hath choſen: hee knoweth them well enough: hee calleth them by his worde, and draweth the ſoules of them vnto him: for if they bee not drawne, they will not come: as hee ſayeth in the ſixt <hi>Chapter</hi> of this Goſpel, <hi>verſ. 44. No man commeth to mee, but them whome the Father draweth.</hi> Hee draweth them by his holie Spirite, to the Sonne: and then hee, and the Sonne, keepeth them to the daye of their full redemption, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them life euerlaſting. So yee may ſee in this place, and in the Epiſtle of <hi>Iude,</hi> at the beginning, that all, who are ſafe in Ieſus Chriſt, are firſt called by the Father: <hi>To them,</hi> ſayeth <hi>Iude, who are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and ſanctified by GOD, and are ſaued by IES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST.</hi> I marke on this, what is the grounde of this authoritie, where hee ſayeth, <hi>Theſe a home thou hast giuen mee, J will giue them life euerlasting</hi>: Hee aſcribeth this authoritie to the Father, and hee ſayeth, hee will ſaue none, but theſe whome the Father hath giuen him. All the Brethren, reade of <hi>IES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST,</hi> the Sonne of <hi>GOD,</hi> in this Euangel, and thorowe out the whole Goſpel, yee ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer reade of him, where hee ſpeaketh of anie thing that hee is doing, hath done, or ſhall doe; but hee giueth the whole glorie of it to the Father. What meaneth this? This is the ground of it, He had his commiſsion from the Father. He came from the Heauen to the Earth, out of the boſome of the Father: &amp; he was an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour, ſent from his Father. Nowe it is good reaſon, that an Ambaſſadour, ſent in an Ambaſſadrie, not only in deed, but alſo in worde, honour his Prince: otherwayes hee is but a traytor. The <hi>LORD IES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi> was an Ambaſſadour ſent from the Father: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in all his actions, and in all his wordes, hee honoureth his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. There is not one of vs all, but wee haue a commiſsion from <hi>GOD,</hi> and is placed in a calling: and there is not one of vs, high nor lowe, but wee are borne to doe ſome thing. Then,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:16631:99"/>
if the Sonne of God, equall with God, hauing a calling of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſought to glorifie God, ſo let vs alſo, in word and deed, gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God: fie on that fleſhe that will not glorifie God, but will aſcribe any thing to himſelfe; and will ſtand vp, and ſay, I did this or that: fie on thee, that wilt ſay ſo, and wilt not honour him, who hath honoured thee. Beware to ſpeake any thing, that may dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate to the glory of God: and not only in deede, but alſo in word glorifie him: that they who heare you ſpeake, may glorifie God thorow your ſpeach, and by your example.</p>
            <p>Now, hauing ſpoken of the ground, we come to the benefite of life euerlaſting it ſelfe: As before wee heard, the glorifying of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt ſerued to the glory of the Father; ſo we haue now, that the glory of Ieſus ſerueth alſo to our glory: So ye may ſee, of what importance is the glory of Ieſus Chriſt: the faireſt fruites that euer were, follow on that glory: thorow his glory, glory commeth to the Father, and life to the world. The chiefe two things in the worlde, are, The glory of God, and the ſaluation of the Kirke: which both proceede from the glory of Ieſus Chriſt. Life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, marke it well, it commeth, and it floweth, of the glorious life of Ieſus Chriſt, when hee roſe from the dead: all our life is by the riſing of Ieſus Chriſt, from death to life. What is this life euerlaſting, or the Spirituall life which wee haue? It is but a little ſponke, that floweth from that fulneſſe of that glorious life which Ieſus Chriſt liueth in the Heauens, at the right hande of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And this quickening Spirit, which euery one of vs receiueth in ſober meaſure, is nothing but a portion of that Spirit of life, which is in Ieſus Chriſt, hat is in him in all ſuperaboundance, and aboue all meaſure. Wee in the Kirke, his members, haue the Spirit of life flowing from him in ſome meaſure. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the <hi>6. Chapter</hi> to the <hi>Romanes, verſ. 5.</hi> hath a notable ſentence concerning this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>If wee bee planted with him, in the likeneſſe of his death, wee ſhall bee planted with him, in the likeneſſe of his life</hi>: meaning, that this morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the olde man, commeth by the vertue of the death and Croſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Ieſus Chriſt: and this newe life commeth by the vertue of his Reſurrection and life. And in the firſt <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, Chap. 15. verſ. 17. J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Christ had not riſen from the dead, wee had yet lyen ſtill in our ſinnes.</hi> So then, wouldeſt thou haue one of the chiefe arguments, to knowe whether Chriſt hath died for thee, or not? (if thou knoweſt not this, thou knoweſt nothing:) deſcende downe into thine heart, and ſee if thou findeſt in any meaſure that
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:16631:99"/>
foule and cankered nature ſlaine into thee, that thou bee dead to ſinne: if thou finde it, thou haſt cauſe to bee blythe, for thou haſt a ſure warrande, that the Lord Ieſus hath died for thee: for if hee had not died for thee, thou hadſt not had anie mortification of ſinne. Then, wouldeſt thou knowe, if the Lord Ieſus hath riſen from the death, (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh,) for thy juſtification? Looke if thou haſt anie part or that ſpirituall life. Woe is to that ſoule, that feeleth no life, no ſpirite, no quickening, &amp;c. for that ſoule hath no warrande, that euer Chriſt roſe, to juſtifie or ſaue it. Therefore, as yee woulde knowe, if Chriſt hath died or riſen for you, looke your warrande: and if yee finde anie mortification, or anie ſenſe of the Spirite, then bee ſure yee haue a warrande: But and if thou findeſt it not, ſay not that Chriſt died for thee; thou haſt no warrande of the death and reſurrection of Chriſt for thee. What is this wee are doing? Wee are ſeeking buſilie Charters and Euidentes for Landes, and Liuinges, and earthlie poſſeſsions: but ſeeke a warrande for Landes, and all the worlde, as thou wilt, ſhame ſhall come vpon thee, if thou wanteſt the warrande of life euerlaſting.</p>
            <p>Now in the next <hi>verſ. This is life euerlaſting, to know thee to be the only true God, and whome thou haſt ſent, Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> In this <hi>verſ.</hi> (marke it) hee letteth vs ſee the neceſsitie there is in glorifying of him, if euer ſuch a thing ſhould be, that one who is choſen ſhould be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified: for hee reaſoneth after this manner, Father, thou knoweſt what, is life, it is a knowledge of thee, and of mee, whom thou haſt ſent: but except I bee glorified, the worlde cannot know thee, nor mee: therefore, Father, except I bee glorified, there is no life for the worlde. So, there is the neceſsitie of the glorifying of Chriſt, to get life euerlaſting; becauſe there cannot be knowledge of God without Chriſt, and except he be glorified. But to conſider theſe wordes more norrowlie, hee ſayeth, <hi>This is life, to knowe thee to bee the onelie true God</hi>: not onelie to knowe thee to bee God, but to knowe thee to bee the onelie God: that is, to put a difference betwixt thee, and the Idole gods of the Gentiles. This excludeth not the Sonne, and the holie Spirite, but hee reſpecteth the time: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the comming of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> the Gentiles were not called, but the worlde was full of Idoles, and men were blinded with er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and ignorance.</p>
            <p>Nowe ſee what is life: there are manie that will ſpeake of life euerlaſting, and yet they knowe not what it meaneth. Life
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:16631:100"/>
euerlaſting ſtandeth in a ſight and in a knowledge: if thou be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, thou ſhalt neuer gette life: It ſtandeth in the light of the mind: thou art full of darkneſſe, and that darkneſſe muſt bee out, and light muſt come in, ere thou getteſt life: But it ſtandeth not in the knowledge of euery thing: many one ſeeketh knowledge: but run where thou wilt to ſeeke knowledge, if thou ſeeſt not him who is the Fountaine of life, from whome all life floweth, thou knoweſt nothing. I meane not of a bare knowledge, for if thou haue no more, it ſhall not auaile thee: but with the knowledge, thou muſt haue faith in thine heart, to drawe out life out of the Fountaine of life. Who is the Fountaine of life? It is the Father of Ieſus Chriſt, who is the Fountaine of all life: the life which the Sonne himſelfe hath, commeth out of that Fountaine, as Chriſt himſelfe confeſſeth in the fifth <hi>Chapter</hi> of this Goſpel, <hi>The Father hath giuen to the Sonne to haue life in himſelfe.</hi> Then all the life of the Angels, and all the life of the creatures, and all our life, ſpirituall or naturall, floweth out of that Fountaine. So, except a man or woman get a ſight of the Father, and of the Lord Ieſus, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not gette life. Lord! if it bee not a great thing to gette a ſight of him! For, as the Apoſtle ſayth to <hi>Timothie, Hee dwelleth in a light that hath none acceſſe.</hi> That deepneſſe of light which hee dwelleth in, is wonderfull, yea, incomprehenſible: and there is no knowledge of the Father, without the Sonne: if thou ſeeſt not the Sonne, thou ſhalt neuer ſee the Father, and ſo thou ſhalt neuer ſee life. Awaye with that dreame of the Iewes, and Turkes, &amp;c. that will ſay, they will get a ſight of the Father, without the Sonne: no, no man ſhall ſee him without the Sonne: For why? neuer man ſawe the Father at any time: it is the onely begotten Sonne, who is in the boſome of the Father, who hath reuealed him. <hi>Iohn, 1. verſ. 18.</hi> Except we gette a ſight of the Sonne, who is the ſplendor of the Father, and the ingrauen forme of his perſon, wee ſhall neuer ſee that glorie. <hi>Hebr. 1. verſ. 3.</hi> So except wee ſee the Sonne of God, the ſeconde perſon of the glorious Trinitie, there ſhall bee no life for man nor woman in this world. And there is no ſight of that glorious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Sonne, who dwelleth in that light vnacceſſable: (as hee is God, hee is as incomprehenſible as his Father:) hee is not ſeene, I ſaye, but vnder a cloude: wee muſt ſee him thorowe this nature of ours: There is no Angell in Heauen, that dare abide to looke on the Son, but thorow a vaile, and this is the vaile of our fleſhe: if thou takeſt awaye that vaile, the ſight of that Majeſtie
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:16631:100"/>
ſhall deuour thee: No, if thou gotteſt a ſight of the Sonne of God, without the ſight of his manlie nature, wherein hee died for our ſinnes, and roſe for our juſtification, thou wouldeſt bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and confounded thereby. But by the contrary, that is the pleaſandeſt ſight that euer thou ſaweſt, when thou ſeeſt that taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of thy nature, that glorious perſon cloathed with the nature of man. The knowledge of Chriſt, muſt be firſt as he is ſent: next, as he is Ieſus: and laſt, as he is Chriſt. His ſending is, as hee is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in the fleſh. And hee is Ieſus, and Chriſt, as hee is God and man. So wee muſt looke thorowe that vaile of man, and thorowe that tabernacle of our nature, ere wee ſee that glorious Majeſtie: And this is joye and life, and our heauen into this earth.</p>
            <p>Yee ſhall marke a notable leſſon of this which I haue ſpoken: See howe knowledge goeth vp thorowe to the Father, and ſee by what degrees life commeth downe from the Father. There are the degrees, and order of our knowledge, and howe it paſſeth vp tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe: Firſt, our eye ſtriketh on the vaile of our nature, wherein that glorious Majeſtie ſitteth. Then, thorowe the vaile, the ſoule pierceth in to that glorious Sonne of God: and then when the ſoule hath gotten that ſight of the Sonne, it paſſeth forwarde to the glorious ſight of the Father, and then our knowledge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth there, for it is the Fountaine of life: Faith neuer reſteth, till it come to the Father, and then it reſteth on him, and there is the joye of it. Nowe, looke howe wee gette life: As ſoone as our ſoule commeth to that Fountaine, the Father, that Fountaine breaketh out in liuing waters. Looke the power of Fayth: Fayth breaketh vp that Fountaine, and then ſpirite and life beginneth to flow. Life commeth firſt from the Father, to the Sonne of <hi>GOD</hi>; and then it commeth from the Sonne, to our nature; and thorowe our nature, that Spirit, and that life, floweth into our ſoules. There is the difference, knowledge beginneth at the nature of man in Chriſt, but life beginneth at the Father. Againe, knowledge paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth vp, and life commeth downe from the Father. Well then, if life euerlaſting ſtand in knowledge of <hi>GOD</hi> in Ieſus Chriſt; then it muſt follow, firſt, as a man or a woman groweth in knowledge, and in fayth, ſo they growe in life euerlaſting: and as they growe in life, ſo they grow in fayth: and in what meaſure thy knowledge is, in that meaſure thy life is: and in what meaſure thy life is, in that meaſure thy fayth is. And when that day ſhall come, when we ſhall ſee the Lord Ieſus face to face, as our knowledge ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:16631:101"/>
ſo ſhall our life and joye: and, in one word, our Heauen ſhall be perfected. The perfection of life euerlaſting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and knowledge, ſtandeth in the ſight of the face of Ieſus Chriſt. And if our life euerlaſting ſtand in knowledge, then death euerlaſting ſtandeth in ignorance: and where there is ignorance of God in Ieſus Chriſt, there death taketh place, and their Hell is begunne here: and that darkneſſe which is in thy ſoule, ſhall bee turned into vtter dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: and the more ignorant thou bee of God in Ieſus Chriſt, the greater ſhall thy damnation bee. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Epheſ. Chap. 4. verſ. 18.</hi> joyneth theſe two together, ſpeaking of the Gentiles, and their eſtate, before Chriſt came into the worlde, ſayeth hee, <hi>they had their mindes darkened, with a cloude of ignorance, and they were aliantes from the life of God</hi>: Meaning, that when as ignorance reigned amongſt the Gentiles, they were all caſten out from the light of Heauen. Where there is nothing but darkneſſe, there is not a ſponke of the life of Chriſt there. Though thou wereſt a King, and haſt but a naturall life, I count thee worſe than a Dogge: howbeit thou canſt paſſe the time, and hunt and haulke, and eate thy meate, &amp;c. thou art deader than a Carrion.</p>
            <p>Seeing then life ſtandeth in the ſight of God, through Ieſus Chriſt, and ſeeing death ſtandeth in the ignorance of the ſoule, this ſhoulde bee our care night and daye, to warble thorowe that cloude of darkneſſe, which hideth vs from that Sonne of God, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There is no ſtanding for thee, but thou ſhalt either grow in light, or in darkneſſe. This ſhould be our care, to put awaye darkneſſe, and get light. Wee ſhould aye la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to caſt off this vaile, vnder the which wee lie, till the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer vs fully from that blindneſſe of the minde, which is a blacke and cloudy couering. The way to bee fredde of this, is to holde vp thine eye, to gette a ſight of the face of Ieſus Chriſt: In the face of Ieſus thou ſeeſt the glory of the Father: Knoweſt thou how thou ſhalt gette it in this life? Seeke it in the worde: All the ſight that we haue here, is but in a mirrour, and by an aenigma, (as th'Apoſtle ſayth) or by a parable, in reſpect of the ſight which wee ſhall haue in the life to come: And this mirrour is the glorious Goſpel. To end in a worde: As thou wouldeſt ſee Ieſus, and bee quite of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: as thou wouldeſt haue life, and be quite of death, ſet thine heart to heare the Goſpel of Ieſus Chriſt; that is the only way for thee to gette a ſight of him in this life.

            <p>Now, ſeeing Chriſt is our light, and our life, the Lord giue vs grace to take heed to him in the mirrour of his word, and to take a delite in it, that we may get this blacke darkneſſe of the ſoule put away, and get a ſight of God, through Ieſus Chriſt: To whom, with the Father, and the holy Ghoſt, be all honour, and prayſe, for euermore.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ee haue heard (Welbeloued in the Lord Ieſus) ſundry arguments that the Lord Ieſus vſeth in his Prayer to his Father, to moue him to glorifie him. (For that is the petition, <hi>Glorifie thy Sonne.</hi>) The firſt argument was fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the time of his death, that was at hand: <hi>The time is come,</hi> ſayeth the Lord, <hi>therefore glorifie thy Sonne.</hi> The ſecond argument was from the glory that ſhould redound to the Father, if he ſhould glorifie the Sonne: <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie thy Sonne, Father, that thy Sonne may glorifie thee.</hi> The third argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was from that life euerlaſting, that hee ſhould giue to them whome the Father had once giuen to him, if hee were once glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied:
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:16631:102"/>
               <hi>Glorifie mee,</hi> ſayeth hee, <hi>that J may giue life euerlaſting to them whom thou haſt giuen mee.</hi> Then hee letteth vs ſee, that it cannot bee poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that he can giue life to any man, except he firſt bee glorified. Life euerlaſting ſtandeth firſt in the knowledge of the Father, that onely true God: Then it ſtandeth in the knowledge of the Sonne, that hee is ſent of the Father, that hee is Ieſus the Sauiour, that hee is Chriſt anointed, and the Mediatour betwixt God and man. Now, would he ſay to the Father, Except thou glorifie mee, neither thou, nor I, ſhall be knowne: and therefore, that life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting may bee giuen to man, it is needfull that I bee glorified. Thus farre hitherto.</p>
            <p>Nowe in the beginning of this Text which wee haue read, wee haue the fourth argument from that glorie hee had giuen to the Father alreadie: <hi>Father,</hi> ſayeth he, <hi>J haue glorified thee on the earth, J have ended the worke that thou gaueſt mee to doe</hi>: what reſteth, but that thou glorifie mee? There muſt bee a meeting heere. The Sonne muſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie the Father, and the Father muſt glorifie the Sonne. So yee ſee verie weightie argumentes of this petition, from the beginning: both the time craueth that the Father ſhould glorifie the Sonne, and then the great fruit that was to proceede thereof: for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould want glorie, and the worlde ſhould want life, if the Sonne were not glorified. And laſt, yee ſee that verie obedience that the Sonne gaue to the Father in the Earth, requireth, that the Father ſhould glorifie him. The Sonne had glorified the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the worlde, and therefore the Father ſhould haue glorified the Sonne in the Heauens.</p>
            <p>But to come to the laſt argument: <hi>J haue glorified thee,</hi> ſayeth the Sonne: This argument leaneth to a promiſe, which the Father made to the Sonne, ere euer hee was manifeſted in the fleſh. As hee would reaſon thus, Father, thou haſt promiſed, that if I ſhould glorifie thee, thou ſhouldeſt glorifie mee: but ſo it is, Father, that I haue glorified thee, therefore glorifie mee. This promiſe is often found in the olde Teſtament, in manie places thereof. Looke the hundreth and tenth PSALME, there it is ſaide, <hi>The Lord ſaide to my Lord,</hi> that is, the Father ſaide to the Sonne, (for both are the Lordes of this worlde,) <hi>ſit thou at my right hand, vntill the time that I make thine enemies thy foote-ſtoole.</hi> There is that promiſed glorie, That hee ſhould make him King ouer the worlde, and humble his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ſpirituall and temporall, vnder his feete. So this is the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie that the Sonne craueth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:16631:102"/>Nowe, Brethren, in verie deede, the Sonne of God might haue claimed juſtlie that promiſe that the Father made to him, vnder the condition of obedience, becauſe the obedience of the Sonne of God, Ieſus Chriſt, was perfect: which obedience being the ground of the promiſe, juſtlie hee might claime that glorie, by reaſon that the promiſe was perfectlie fulfilled. But to come to vs: There was no man ſince the fall of Adam, that dare be bolde, except they bee vtterlie impudent, to claime anie life or grace of God, by vertue of this condition of obedience, and to ſay, Lord, I haue done this, therefore Lord, giue me life. There is no fleſhe, no, not the beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed man that euer was, that hath that freedome, that can ſaye this, By vertue of my merite giue mee life. Looke what Paul, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed man, ſayeth of himſelfe, <hi>Philipp. 3. verſ. 9. I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſteeme all to bee but dongue, that I may gaine Chriſt.</hi> For why? Brethren, there is no fleſh, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that man Ieſus Chriſt, that euer hath had, or will haue, that perfect obedience, which meriteth anie grace at Gods hands. This ſhall ſtand, though all the worlde would riſe againſt it, with the Pope, and that whole rabble: Therefore it commeth to paſſe, that none, either who is, was, or ſhall bee, ſhall bee made righteous in the preſence of God, or gette life euerlaſting, but they who paſſe from the condition of workes, (that is called the Legall coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,) and take them onelie to that promiſe made in the blood of Ieſus Chriſt; and ſeeke not life by vertue of their workes, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie by vertue of the blood of Ieſus Chriſt. I denounce, in the Name of Ieſus Chriſt, if thou ſeekeſt not life onelie by that blood, thou ſhalt neuer ſee nor taſte of life. If thou begin to ſeeke grace by thy merites, thou ſhalt neuer get it, becauſe thou treadeſt downe vnder thy feete, the blood of Chriſt, and renounceſt it, and takeſt thee to thy peltrie.</p>
            <p>But yet let vs marke the words better: <hi>I haue glorified thee, Father</hi>: that is, I haue put an ende to that worke thou gaueſt me, the faire worke of the redemption of man, the faireſt worke that euer was: yea, fairer than the creation of the worlde. Nowe howe is this hee ſayth, <hi>I haue ended it,</hi> ſeeing hee had not ſatisfied, and was not cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and the end of this worke was founded on the Croſſe of Ieſus Chriſt, and that bitter ſuffering? The anſwere is eaſie: He ſpeaketh of the worke to come, as though it were paſt alreadie, for the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of it: for it was moſt ſure, he behoued to ſuffer, and alſo for the nearneſſe of it: for his death &amp; latter paſſion was at hand. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther queſtion: How is it that hee ſayeth, <hi>J haue glorified thee already,</hi>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:16631:103"/>
in time paſt, when as hee ſaide before, <hi>Father, glorifie thy Sonne, that hee may glorifie thee,</hi> in the time to come? They ſtand very well toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for the Sonne, the Lord Ieſus, hee both glorified his Father, before he was glorified by his Father; and alſo when he was glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by his Father, both the times, he glorified his Father: But ſee the difference: The Lord Ieſus glorified the Father, before hee was glorified of the Father, in that moſt humble obedience he gaue to his Father: there was neuer a man humbled vnder the Father as he. In that obedience he gaue to the Father, the mercy &amp; loue of the Father ſhined in the world in his humility. The worl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e wondered that euer there ſhould haue beene ſuch a mercy and ſuch a loue of God to man. And they who wil look to this humble man, the Lord Ieſus, they will wonder, that euer there ſhould haue beene ſuch a mercy to man. If thou look wel to the obedience and humbleneſſe of the Son, thou ſhalt wonder at the loue of the Father toward vs; who humbled his owne Son, not onely as a ſeruant, but to the vile death, the accurſed death of the Croſſe, for our cauſe, as Chriſt himſelfe ſayth, <hi>Iohn, 3. verſ. 16. The Father hath ſo loued the worlde, that hee hath giuen his onelie begotten Sonne for it, that all, that belieue in him, ſhould hee ſaued, and none periſhe.</hi> What man will giue his onelie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten ſonne to ſaue another? <hi>Nowe this commendeth the loue of God,</hi> ſayeth Paul, <hi>Rom. 5. verſ. 8. that when wee were enemies, Chriſt died for vs.</hi> Who is hee that will die for his enemie? or what father will giue his ſonne for him? So, neither man nor Angel is able to comprehende the thouſande parte of the loue which the Father bare to the worlde, in humbling his onelie begotten Sonne. So the Sonne glorified the Father in his humiliation. Then againe, when the Sonne was glorified of the Father, after he was raiſed from the dead, and aſcended to the Heauens, and ſet at the right hand of his Father, in that glory incomprehenſible, the Sonne glorified the Father in that exaltation: as hee glorified him before in his humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, ſo doeth he in his exaltation: and hee glorified the Father in his exaltation, by reaſon that there appeared ſuch a wonderfull power in God, in exalting Chriſt in our nature, that was ſo hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in the graue. And when the worlde ſaw, that the body of the man Ieſus Chriſt, was raiſed vp ſo gloriouſly, they wondered, that euer there ſhould haue beene ſuch a power in GOD: All the Angels in Heauen gotte neuer ſuch a Reuelation of the power of GOD, as then when the LORD IESVS was raiſed vp from the death to life. Not onelie raiſed hee a dead man vp from
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:16631:103"/>
death, but hee raiſed him vp in ſuch a wonderfull highneſſe, that he made him King ouer all kinges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and aboue all Angels, and gaue him ſuch a Name, that at the Name of Ieſus all knees ſhould bow, of men and Angels, of all things vnder the earth, and aboue it: and that all tongues ſhould confeſſe, that Ieſus Chriſt is the Lord of Lords, and God of all glory. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Epheſians, Chap. 1. verſ. 20.</hi> when hee ſpeaketh of this power, hee will not ſimply call it a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, but he ſaith this, According to the effectualneſſe of his ſtrong power, which hee vttered in Chriſt, when hee raiſed him from the dead: that is the firſt degree: and placed him at his right hand, that is the ſecond degree. There appeareth the power of God, in exalting him in our nature, to ſo high a glory. It appeared not ſo great at the creation, as then when hee exalted the Man Ieſus Chriſt. Wouldeſt thou knowe the power of God? Looke to that exaltation, and thou ſhalt ſee it ſhine in a greater meaſure, than in any thing that euer was wrought. Men by nature would ſee things to rauiſh them to admiration: but I tell thee, if thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt wonder at any thing, wonder at theſe things, at the humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Ieſus Chriſt, and at the exaltation of Ieſus Chriſt: the wonderfulleſt doctrine that euer ſounded in the worlde. So when thou heareſt of the death of Chriſt, and of his exalting, wonder; for ſuch a wondering ſhall worke ſaluation. Let vs ſee all the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the world, neuer one of them ſhall worke life or ſaluation, but that wonder. The anſwere may bee otherwayes. The Lord when he was in the world, hee glorified the Father in his prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and Prieſthood: hee is that annointed Prophet, Prieſt, and King: So he being Prophet, Prieſt, and King, hee glorified the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Earth, chiefely in his propheſie, hee teached aye in the world: he glorified alſo the Father in his Prieſthood: he aye ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: neuer a day, paſſed by, from his birth, vntill his latter breath, without ſome ſuffering. But in his Kingly office, hee glorified the Father when hee was exalted, and raiſed vp to the Heauen, and ſet downe at the right hand of that Majeſty: and that is the office in this houre, in the which the Sonne of God glorifieth his Father, in ſitting there as a King of Heauen and Earth, reigning in the middeſt of his enemies, with a great yron rodde, battering them in pieces, like a potte-ſhard: and that ſame rodde of yron, ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer leaue them, till it bruiſe them downe. There was neuer a King ſo glorious, as he is at the right hand of the Father: and when wee ſhall ſee him in that Princely Throne, wee ſhall ſay, wee neuer ſaw
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:16631:104"/>
glory in this world to that glory. And when the conqueſſe which the Lord Ieſus is making in Heauen, and in Earth, (for the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are not yet altogether ſubdued: no, the day paſſeth not, but he maketh ſome conqueſſe,) when it ſhall bee ended, I ſay, hee ſhall render vp that Kingdome into the hands of the Father. <hi>1. Cor. 15. verſ. 24.</hi> When death is ouercome, and the Deuill, (for death is not yet ouercome,) he ſhal render all into the hands of the Father, and there ſhall not be an enemie, but all ſhall be caſten down, and all the Choſen ſhall treade downe the neckes of Emperours. Wee marke one thing, ere we goe to the next <hi>verſ.</hi> for our vſe, to draw this to our ſelues. This is the proteſtation which the Lord maketh a little before his death: Hee proteſteth, that aboue all things in Heauen or in Earth, hee ſought the glory of his Father, euen to his owne death. Now well is that man, who whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the hour of death is drawn neare, is able to ſay in any meaſure, Lord, I haue glorified thee: and howbeit it be with great infirmity, Lord, I haue honoured thee in my life. Yee ſee, olde men will reckon of things paſt: if they haue bene notable inſtruments in any thing, they will talk &amp; ſay, I haue done this and that. But alas! if thou hadſt won kingdoms, al auails not, if thou canſt not ſay, Lord, I haue ſought to glorify thee. Away with all the world, and with all the felicity of it, and all thou haſt ſuffered and done in it, if thou canſt not ſay, when thou art going out of this world, I ſtroue, at the leaſt, to glorifie thee. And at the leaſt, if thou, who haſt bene a notable ſinner, canſt not ſay, Lord, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue me, I haue bene a ſinner, and haue not repented in time, now I repent, &amp; craue thee mercy: if thou canſt not ſay this, wo is thee, if thou hadſt conqueſſed as much as <hi>Alexander</hi> the great Monarch, if thou hadſt conqueſſed all the world. I tell thee the trueth, if thou goe out of the world without one of theſe two, woe ſhalbe to thee that euer thou came in the world, thou ſhal neuer ſee life. But there is a great difference betwixt the proteſtation of the Lord Ieſus, &amp; all the proteſtations that we can make: <hi>J haue glorified thee,</hi> ſaith the Son, <hi>therfore glorify thou me.</hi> The Son might haue ſoght glory, becauſe of the excellency of his perſon: but as for vs, wee may not craue glorification for our obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to God, becauſe it is imperfect: away awaye, with that ſtinking merite of the Papiſtes: awaye with the creature, that will attribute ſuch a ſtinking merite to it ſelfe. Therefore thou muſt ſay, Lord, I craue nothing for my merite, but onelie for grace: for when thou haſt done all that thou canſt doe, thou art but an vnprofitable ſeruant: and ſaye, I will creepe vnder
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:16631:104"/>
the winges of thy mercie. But if thou come to claime anie thing with a conceite of thy merite, ſuppoſe thou hadſt done workes to glorifie thy God, builded Kirkes, and made Bridges, &amp;c. if thou acclaime anie thing for it, and wilt ſtand vp, and ſaye, I haue done this, thou ſhalt goe awaye without grace. The Phariſie may ſtand for an example of this. There was neuer ſuch a pride, as to a ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king creature to ſtand vp before that Tribunall, with a conceit of his merite: If thou ſtandeſt vp ſo, I pronounce, the effect of that merite of thine ſhall bee condemnation.</p>
            <p>When he hath vſed ſo many arguments to the Father, to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him, then he concludeth his petition in theſe wordes, <hi>Therefore, Father, glorify me with thy ſelfe</hi>: that is to ſay, Not in the Earth: <hi>I haue glorified thee in the Earth,</hi> but the glory that I ſeek, <hi>is</hi> not in the earth, but <hi>in the Heauens,</hi> wherein I would reigne: not in the Earth, as an earthly Prince, but in the Heauens, at thy right hand. The place maketh much. It is vnpoſsible that there can be ſo much glorie in the Earth, as in the Heauens. The glory of all the Kinges in the world, is nothing to that which we ſhall haue with Ieſus Chriſt in the Heauens. The glory which Adam had, in that glorious and earthly Paradiſe, was nothing in reſpect of that glory which wee ſhall haue, when we ſhall be lifted vp in the Heauens. Looke howe farre diſtance is betwixt Heauen and Earth, as farre ſhall our glory ſhine aboue that glory: no compare of the darkeſt Starre, with the Sun. So compare that glory of <hi>Adams,</hi> with the glory we ſhal haue with Ieſus Chriſt: &amp; look how far the Sun paſſeth in glory aboue a Starre, as farre we ſhall paſſe that glory, and ſurmount aboue it.</p>
            <p>What a glory is this he ſeeketh? <hi>Glorify me with that glory, Father, which I had from all eternitie</hi>: that is, Glorifie me with that glorie of the Sonne of God, the glorie of the ſecond perſon of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: glorifie mee with thine owne glorie, which is promiſed mee: and glorifie mee with all thy glorie. The Sonne may claime all the glorie of the Father, and the Father hee communicateth not with the Sonne a parte of his glorie, but the whole glorie of GOD.</p>
            <p>Now, Brethren, yee ſhall marke ſome things ſhortly: Certainlie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> no man nor no Angel, that can bee capable of this matter, that concerneth the incomprehenſible glorie of the Father, and of the Sonne: and therefore wee marke this ſhortlie: Firſt, wee ſee this, what a glory this is that the Sonne ſeeketh of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: this I tolde you in the beginning: It is not ſo much the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:16631:105"/>
glory of the nature of man, as it is that glory that the Lord had with the Father from all eternity. Then yee ſee another thing: yee ſee the Sonne of God, the Lord Ieſus, ere euer he came down into this Earth, he was in the forme of God, and thought it no robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to be equall with God. Hee is the Sonne of God, equall in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and Majeſty with the Father. Let the Heretiques hang them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, who would depriue the Lord Ieſus of his Godhead: our fai<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h ſhould not bee grounded on him, if he would be no warrand to our faith, and if he were not God bleſſed for euer.</p>
            <p>Then yee ſee, how the Lord Ieſus, the Sonne of God, paſſed from that glory which hee had with the Father, for a time, and made himſelfe (as the Apoſtle ſayeth) of no reputation. Wee would not bee content of this, none of vs all, to deject our ſelues altogether: yea, euen the fillieſt of vs: yet the Sonne of God made himſelfe of no reputation nor eſtimation. Marke this: thinke not that the Sonne of God, the Lord Ieſus, euer renounced that glory which hee had with the Father: no, not then, when hee was ſoreſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled: no, not then, when he was hanging on the Croſſe, he renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced not his glory, as <hi>Cyrillus</hi> ſayth, <hi>Miſſio, &amp; obedientia, non tollunt aequalitatem potentiae &amp; eſſentiae</hi>: that is, <hi>The ſending and obedience, taketh not away the equalitie of glorie and eſſence.</hi> Marke it well, and be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued: Howe then paſſed hee from this glory? This is an higher matter than we can conſider, yet wee ſhall expreſſe it in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: The Sonne of God, equall with the Father, ſuffered for a time that glory to bee obſcured with the habite of a ſeruant, the habite of man: the glory of the Sonne of God was made of no reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thorow the taking on of a ſlough. Howe agree theſe two, the mortall and corrupt fleſh, and the glory of God? Will not that ſlough of our nature obſcure the glory of God? Then againe, the glory of God, in the Sonne of God, is obſcured with the moſt vile death, the death of the Croſſe: and this was the higheſt degree of his obedience: Yet hee neuer quiteth himſelfe of this glory. I will vſe a ſimilitude: Yee ſee the Sunne ſhineth faire and bright: and if a thicke blacke cloude ſhould paſſe in betwixt vs and the Sunne, the Sunne abideth in his owne nature, and the cloude taketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing away of the brightneſſe of the Sunne; only it obſcureth the Sunne to our ſight, that we cannot perceiue the ſplendor of it: It is euen ſo with the Sonne of God, that glorious Sunne of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; when he taketh firſt vpon him the cloude of our nature, and ſecondly the cloude of death, the glory of the Sonne of God is no
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:16631:105"/>
more impared by this, than the Sunne is impared in his light by the cloude. When the Sonne of God tooke vpon him the cloude of our nature, for the ſaluation of mankinde, hee kept himſelfe cloſe, and he vttered not himſelfe in that nature of God: for if he had vttered himſelfe in that force and glory proper vnto him, he had beene glorified at his firſt incarnation, and then the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man had not bene done. All the Iewes and Phariſees could neuer haue touched him, if hee had not humbled himſelfe in the nature of man. Looke to this, and in the meane time gather howe much wee are beholden vnto him. What King would haue hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelfe ſo? No, there is no King who would haue put on a Beggars weed for a ſlaues cauſe; let bee to humble himſelfe ſo far. Now looke how we are indebted to him: yea, if it were a thouſand liues, it is too little to giue for him who hath ſo humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for vs.</p>
            <p>Nowe laſt, yee ſee in what ſenſe and meaning the Sonne of God ſeeketh this glory: Hee ſeeketh not a glory which hee had not the time that he ſought it; for he had i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>wayes, from all eternity. He ſought not alſo to bee quite of the nature of man; for then hee ſhould not haue bene our Sauiour. Hee ſeeketh not to be quite of the firſt cloude, but of the ſecond. He ſeeketh to be quite of death, and hee ſeeketh that that Godhead ſhould glorifie the Sonne of man, that the beames of that Godhead ſhould ſtrike out, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie the nature of man. And indeede, howe ſoone that Godhead that dwelt in him, began to vtter it ſelfe, when his head was lying low in the graue, then the man getteth vp, and life commeth into our nature. And next, when the Godhead vttered it ſelfe in that nature, then that man is lifted vp to the Heauens. And laſt, when the Godhead vttered it ſelfe, the man Chriſt is placed at the right hand of the Father, and that nature of man ſhineth in ſuch ſort, that it paſſeth all the glory of the Angels. This is very comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: Thou wilt ſay, What recks me of all this glory? and what is that to mee? Howbeit that that man be glorified, yet I abide here in the earth, a vile body: what recks mee if the worlde were glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, if I got not a ſhare of it? Now, wilt thou take but once holde of that nature of man, and once fix thine eye vpon it? that is, Wilt thou belieue in Ieſus Chriſt, God and man? ſet thine heart on him, that he firſt died for thee, and ſecondly that he roſe for thee: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue that all this was once done for thee; then certainly, as ſure as the nature of man in Ieſus died, and was glorified, as ſure thou
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:16631:106"/>
ſhalt bee glorified: and as ſoone as thou toucheſt him, the glorie shall ſtrike out, and ouerſhaddow thee in this life: when thou loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt into the mirrour of his Goſpel, (for wee ſee him here but in a mirrour,) it ſhall ouer-ſhaddow thee, I ſay: but when faith ſhall be changed into ſight, and wee ſee him face to face, and ſit fore-anent him, and looke to his glorious face, thoſe glaunces which ſhall proceede from him, (as it is ſaide to the Philippians, CHAP. 3. VERS. 21.) ſhall transforme thy vile bodie, and ſhall conforme it to his glorious bodie. There is ſuch an effectualneſſe in his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, whereby hee ſubdued all thinges, that if thou ſhalt gette a ſight of him, hee ſhall chaunge thy bodie in a moment, and hee ſhall make it to ſhine more brighter than the Sunne. Onelie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue, ſo long as thou art heere. A man who hath faith in him, ſhall ſee this glorie. If thou getteſt not a ſight of Chriſt by fayth in this worlde, thou ſhalt neuer ſee him heereafter to life and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. So let vs belieue, and ſtirre vp euerie one of vs another, with exhortations, that as euer wee would ſee glorie, wee belieue in Ieſus Chriſt: To whome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Itherto (Welbeloued in the Lord IESVS) in this Prayer the Lord hath prayed for himſelfe, that the Father would glorifie him. To this purpoſe hee vſed ſundry argumentes: Firſt, ſayeth hee, <hi>The houre is come,</hi> that is, The houre of my death is at hand, <hi>therefore, Father, glorifie mee.</hi> Then hee ſayeth, <hi>Father, if thou wilt glorifie mee, I will glorifie thee</hi>: therefore glorifie mee. Yet farder, <hi>If thou wilt glorifie mee, J wll giue life euerlasting to theſe whome thou haſt giuen mee, therefore, Father, glorifie mee.</hi> Yet marke, <hi>I haue glorified thee on the Earth, and I haue ended that worke which thou gaueſt mee to doe.</hi> What reſteth then? ſayeth hee, <hi>But that thou, O Father, ſhouldeſt glorifie mee.</hi> Then hee concludeth, <hi>Therefore, Father, glorifie mee with thy ſelfe, not in the Earth, but in the Heauens, with that glorie which I had with thee before the worlde was.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nowe, in the next parte of his Prayer, the Lord prayeth for his Apoſtles, eleuen in number: Hee prayeth not for Iudas, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee was a reprobate. There are two thinges which hee ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth at the Father for them: The firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, That when hee ſhoulde goe his waye to the Heauen, the Father ſhoulde keepe them from all euill in the worlde. The ſeconde is, That the Father ſhoulde ſanctifie them to that worke which they were appointed vnto. There are ſundrie argumentes and reaſons of this firſt parte of this Petition for his Diſciples, That the Father woulde keepe them, and ſaue them. Hee heapeth in the beginning manie ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentes, as namelie, from their calling and vocation, from their election, from that they were the Fathers, from that they were giuen to him, from that that they belieued the Worde, and from that that hee was going to the Father. He heapeth together theſe arguments &amp; reaſons, in praying for them, that the Father would keepe and ſaue them.</p>
            <p>But let vs marke the words narrowly, and goe thorow euery ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and obſerue ſuch doctrine as ſhall be to our edification, as God ſhall giue the grace. He begins, &amp; ſayth firſt, <hi>J haue declared thy Name vnto the men which thou gaueſt me out of the world.</hi> So the firſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon wherewith he moueth the Father to keepe them, is, from that hee had manifeſted vnto them the Name of the Father: That is to ſaye, That hee had called them by the Preaching of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Euangel of IESVS CHRIST. So our vocation and calling ſtandeth in the manifeſtation of GOD, in IESVS CHRIST, by
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:16631:107"/>
the preaching and hearing of the Goſpel: Wee are called, when God and his will is manifeſted to vs, by the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of Ieſus Chriſt. Well then, if the Lord Ieſus vſeth this as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument and reaſon, to moue his Father to keepe them, and to ſaue them, now certainly, when any perſon findeth, that <hi>GOD</hi> calleth on them by the preaching of the Goſpel, (as he is calling on you this day:) Then certainly they haue an argument and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that that God who calleth on them, wil keepe and ſaue them, both in this li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, and in the life to come: for all this preaching and hearing of the Goſpel of Ieſus Chriſt, is not for nothing, and the Lord neuer calleth man nor woman by the preaching of the Goſpel for nothing: by calling he vttereth that he wil keepe them; as this day, if hee call on you inwardly by his Spirit, hee vttereth that he will keepe and ſaue you, both in this life, and in the life to come. So that when one findeth that the Lord calleth them, and offereth this Goſpel vnto them, they may conceiue an hope into their heart, that the Lord will ſaue them. Why? Becauſe the Lord is calling on them by his word: This is a token, ſay thou, that hee will keepe mee in this life, and in the life to come. And if, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, any that is called in this life, man or woman, attaine not to ſaluation, and that the Lord keepe them not, the fault is in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, becauſe when the Lord called on them, they would not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere. No, not one of you, wee ſaye, ſhall periſhe for fault of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, but becauſe ye made your ſelues vnworthie: when the Lord cried, yee would not heare him. Ingrate and fooliſh ſoule! thou ſhalt periſhe, becauſe thou wouldeſt not obeye the Lord, ſo fairelie and gentlie calling on thee. But if, when thou art called to life, by the preaching of the Goſpel, wilt ſay, Lord, I am here: if the heart will reſound, and ſay, Lord, I am here: if thou wilt anſwere: that is, belieue the word preached, and bee ready to obey the ſame; that is as ſure an angument, that the Lord will ſaue thee euerlaſtinglie, as euer was in the world.</p>
            <p>Now to goe forward, to the reſt of the arguments. <hi>I haue,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>manifested thy Name to theſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> men whom thou gauest mee, being choſen out of the worlde.</hi> There is the ſecond reaſon, <hi>Father, thou hast choſen them for thy ſelfe, from all eternitie,</hi> therefore good reaſon is it, that thou ſhouldeſt keepe them. Why ſhould hee not keepe his owne Elect. Well then, if the Lord vſe this argument to the Father, to moue him to keepe and ſaue his Diſciples; nowe certainly, that perſon that ſeeth himſelfe one of the choſen and elect of God, to
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:16631:107"/>
that life from all eternitie, that perſon who findeth in his heart, that he is one of that number, hath a ſure and infallible warrand, that that God who hath choſen him, ſhall warrand him. Seeke aye to know your election; for if ye be ſure of your election, ye haue a ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ale of your eternall ſaluation. It is vnpoſſible, that a man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who is choſen to life, can periſhe; and that hee whoſe name is once written vp in the decree of God, ſhould be loſt. Ye may aske at mee, Seeing it is vnpoſsible, that the Choſen from all eternitie can periſh, or be loſt; wherefore then prayeth the Sonne to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that hee ſhould keepe his Diſciples, choſen to life from all eternitie? if of neceſsitie the Choſen muſt liue, though all the world had ſworne it, wherefore is it then, that the Sonne prayeth the Father ſo earneſtly, to keepe thoſe who were choſen? what neede had hee to pray for them, ſeeing the Choſen muſt be ſaued? The anſwere is eaſie: It is true indeede, that thoſe who are choſen from all eternity, muſt be ſafe, &amp; liue of neceſsity: but it is alſo true again, Brethren, he who chooſes them to life, &amp; ordaines them to liue, of neceſsity the ſame very God, from all eternity, ordained ſuch middles, as prayer, ſayth, good works, &amp; ſuch other meanes, that by them we ſhould attaine to life: He who ordaineth life, hee ordaineth prayer: if thou want the meanes, thou ſhalt neuer enter into life: if thou want faith, and prayer, and good works, ſay with thy ſelfe, thou waſt neuer ordained to life: deceiue not your ſelues. So, Brethren, we ſhould take heed to theſe middles: as neceſſarilie as the Lord hath appointed thee to life, as neceſſarily thou muſt belieue, as euer thou wouldeſt liue after this life: for as neceſſarily the Lord hath choſen thee to doe good works from all eternitie, as he hath choſen thee to life. And then, when we finde theſe mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, and an heart to pray, (take heed,) he will keepe vs, &amp; ſaue vs, both in this life, and in the life to come. And when we finde good turns in our hands, and faith in Ieſus Chriſt, then (ſayth <hi>Peter</hi>) we confirme our election: all theſe middles confirme our election: for the Lord hath choſen vs to theſe, aſwell as to the end it ſelfe. If we want theſe means, we haue no warrand that euer the Lord appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vs to life. I will leaue this. He coms forward, &amp; heapeth argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments together to the Father, that he would keepe &amp; ſaue them: <hi>Thine they wer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi>: there is the reaſon: <hi>they were thine own property by vertue of election</hi>: whomſoeuer the Lord chooſeth from all eternity, they are the propertie of the Lorde, by vertue of election: So ſayeth the Sonne to the Father, They were thine by vertue of election:
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:16631:108"/>
therefore keepe and ſaue thine owne. Whome wilt thou keepe, if thou keepe not thine owne, whome thou haſt choſen? Therefore keepe them.</p>
            <p>Well, Brethren, vſeth the Sonne of God theſe argumentes, to mooue his Father to keepe and ſaue his Diſciples? now ſurely that man, or that woman, who findeth that they belong to God, and that they are choſen from all eternity, that may ſaye, I am Gods, I am his inheritance, and property, that perſon hath a ſure warrand, that God, to whome they appertaine, will keepe and ſaue them euerlaſtingly. Get me this knowledge once, that thou art Gods, and thou ſhalt knowe aſſuredly in thine heart, that God, whome to thou appertaineſt, ſhall neuer let thee bee loſt: yea, Heauen and Earth ſhall goe together, ere thou periſh. But yee will ſay, Howe ſhall I knowe that I am Gods? Marke it, Brethren: The man, or the woman, that appertaineth to God, that God whome to they appertaine, ere they ſlit out of this worlde, hee will giue them ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſement, and will let them knowe and feele, either one time or other, early or late, that they are his. Paul, in the eight Chapter to the <hi>Romanes, verſ. 9.</hi> hath a notable ſaying, Thoſe who haue not the Spirite of Ieſus, they are not his. On the contrary, the man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who feeleth this Spirite, are his. Wouldeſt thou knowe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou be Gods or not? If thou findeſt in thine heart that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Spirit, that worketh redemption, grace, mortification of ſinne, quickening of the newe life, and all bleſſedneſſe; if thou findeſt him, ſaye, I am Gods: for God will giue to none his holy Spirite, but to his owne ſecret ones, who are choſen from all eternity, and ſo made the property of God. Wouldeſt thou know the Spirite? I ſhall giue thee a token, which the Apoſtle ſetteth downe, <hi>Rom. 5. verſ. 5.</hi> If the Spirit dwell in thee, he will ſhed abroade, and powre out that ſweet loue of God into thine heart: he will let thee feele ſenſibly in thine heart, that God loueth thee: and teſtifie to thee, that thou art the Sonne of God by Adoption, and that thou art an Heire of Heauen, and ſhalt reigne with God, as an Heire of God, and as a fellow-Heire with Ieſus Chriſt. Take heede, the Sonne of God loueth vs in his heart, when he findeth that we haue his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and that we are choſen to life. In theſe things wee ſhould bee occupied moſt, if euer wee would gette life, wee ſhould be buſie to ſeeke our warrand of Heauen. Alace! he that hath a bit of Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, or a bit of Land, hee will bee buſie night and daye, to ſeeke a warrand for it: and yet wee will not beſtowe any time to ſeeke a
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:16631:108"/>
warrand for life euerlaſting. But nowe I ſhall goe forwarde to the fourth argument.</p>
            <p>The fourth argument is in theſe wordes, <hi>Thou hast giuen, mee them</hi>: therefore, Father, ſaue and keepe thine owne gift: Father, thou haſt giuen them to mee, not to loſe, but to ſaue. Well then, Brethren, as I ſaide before, if this bee a reaſon that the Lord vſeth to mooue his Father, to keepe and ſaue his Diſciples; certainlie then, euery ſoule, who findeth that the Father hath giuen them ouer into the handes of the Sonne, that God hath put them in the hands of the Mediator, the Lord Ieſus, hath a ſure argument, that the Father will keepe them euerlaſtingly. If thou bee giuen once to the Mediator, it is a thing vnpoſsible, that thou canſt bee loſt. The gift of the Father, is not like the gift of men: When they haue giuen the gift, they care not for it, what to doe haue they with it? it is not theirs. But when the Father giueth the Choſen once to the Sonne, his eye will be euer vpon that gift: and he will ſee that that gift of the Sonne be kept and ſaued. Ye muſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this, that when the Father reſigneth vs ouer to the Sonne, he hath a care of vs, and we are ſtill the Fathers, as wel as the Sonnes: and this is euident by Chriſtes wordes is this ſame Chapter, <hi>All mine is thine, and thine is mine,</hi> ſayth Chriſt: he reſigneth vs not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, as though he had no care of vs, for we are his gift, and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and he quiteth him neuer of vs, but euen when hee hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs to the Sonne, wee remaine the Sonnes gift, and the Fathers property: and that gift neuer impareth that loue which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beareth towards vs, nor his carefull prouidence ouer vs: Yea, by the contrary, this is a meane to ſaue vs. Wherefore putteth hee thee in the hands of the Sonne? Euen to the end that he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme thee, and ſaue thee with his blood. So this is the meane, yea the only meane to ſaue thee euerlaſtingly.</p>
            <p>But marke this, Brethren: See how mutually the Father and the Sonne recommende the Choſen one to another: the heart of man is not able to comprehende this care which the Father and the Sonne haue ouer the Choſen: Firſt the Father giueth them to the Sonne, that hee ſhould redeeme them: and then, when the Sonne hath gotten them, hee maketh interceſsion to the Father, that the Father would keepe them, and ſaue them: And whome the Father hath giuen, he hath a care of them. Seeſt thou not the groundes of thy ſaluation, which is, the mutuall recommending of thee, from the Father to the Sonne, and from the Sonne to the Father? The
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:16631:109"/>
Father giueth vs to the Sonne: the Sonne againe maketh interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for vs to the Father. Howe can it bee poſsible, that thoſe can periſh, whom both the Father and the Sonne haue ſuch a care of? If thou be choſen, how can it bee poſsible, that thou canſt periſhe? Seeing our ſaluation is ſo wonderfully grounded, that all the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Heauen and Earth is not able to ſhake off the groundes of it. But alace, Brethren, heere is all the fault: There is ſuch a blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and doubtfulneſſe in our hearts, that we cannot ſee nor feele the eſtabliſhed groundes whereon our ſaluation ſtandeth: and therefore we haue not yet ſolide joye and conſolation: for all the joye of this life, is the confidence of theſe groundes of our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for except a man or a woman gripe into that ſaluation, they haue no joye. Now would to God we could learne to ſee and feele our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>! we ſhold feel &amp; ſee wonderful things, &amp; we ſhold find ſuch a ſolidnes, that we wold defy al the deuils of hel. Now hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to we haue heard four very ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g reaſons, wherby the Father ſhold be moued to ſaue the Diſciples, both in this life, and in the life to come. Now, Brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, mark theſe reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which we haue heard: they are all without vs: the manner of our vocation is without vs: our election is without vs: that, that wee belong to God, is without vs: that we are giuen to Ieſus Chriſt, by the Father, is without vs: Yet all theſe outward graces of God, will neuer auaile thee to life and ſaluation, if thou getteſt not the inwarde feeling of them in thine heart, before thou be taken out of this life: if thou getteſt not the inwarde grace in thine heart, to apprehende thy vocation, and thine election: if thou gripe not in thine heart, firſt, that thou art Gods property: &amp; ſecondly, that thou art Ieſus Chriſts, all the grace that thou ſhalt get in this life, ſhall ſerue thee for nothing. Nowe, Brethren, this feeling of grace in the heart, is nothing but faith. What is this faith, that euery man hath in his mouth, but that feeling of the grace of God? The feeling of our vocation, of our election, and of that mercy which God giueth vs in Ieſus Chriſt, is nothing but an inwarde ſight and apprehenſion of them all: therefore the Lord leaueth all outwarde graces, and commeth to the inwarde apprehenſion: that is, to faith, and ſayeth, <hi>O Father, they belieue all that J ſpake vnto them</hi>: and therefore, O Father, keepe them. Ye ſee, Brethren, amongſt many arguments which we haue, there is the moſt ſpeciall: when God ſtampeth in our heartes a feeling of grace: getting once that ſtampe, that wee are called, by faith in God, and in Ieſus Chriſt, then the Charter of our election
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:16631:109"/>
is ſealed, (for our election is but a Charter,) then wee haue our warrande in our boſome, that wee ſhall neuer periſhe, but haue life euerlaſting. It is vnpoſsible that anie man or woman who findeth this, can periſhe, for they haue the earneſt-pennie of their ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who haue once gotten fayth.</p>
            <p>But, Brethren, if wee would marke the wordes which the Lord Ieſus vſeth in ſetting downe this faith, they are many and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and great conſolation in them: faith muſt haue a knowledge: for if thou haſt no knowledge, and ſayeſt then, that thou haſt faith, thou lieſt: if thou bee an ignorant bodie, and knoweſt not Ieſus Chriſt, and wilt ſtande vp, and ſaye, I haue faith, thou lieſt: faith muſt haue an eye, a ſight, and a knowledge. The firſt thing in faith, is ſight: thou muſt ſee God, and that in that glorious face of his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt, howbeit afarre off, as in a mirrour. And ſeeing there is a ſight and a knowledge required in faith, the Lord paſſeth not ouer this, but hee ſayeth, <hi>They haue knowne, that all thinges which thou hast giuen mee, are of thee.</hi> There is the firſt, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. <hi>And, that I came from thee</hi>: there is the ſight. Nowe, goe forwarde, and yee ſhall ſee faith painted out: It is not enough to knowe, and to ſee, if thou haſt no more: if thou haſt but a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and a ſight of Ieſus Chriſt onelie, thou art not the nearer: but the heart of man and woman, muſt drawe in into it that thing which thou knoweſt and ſeeſt. Thou ſeeſt and knoweſt Chriſt to bee the Redeemer: the verie heart muſt gette out the arme, and pull him in: And therefore hee paſſeth not by this: <hi>The wordes which thou gaueſt mee, J haue giuen them vnto them.</hi> Haue they knowne them onelie? No, but they haue alſo receiued them. Is it enough to receiue them? No, that is not enough. Then what muſt thou doe? Thou muſt not haue Chriſt to night, and bid him farewell to morrowe: but as thou haſt knowne him, and receiued him, ſo thou muſt keepe Chriſt euer in thine heart, and thou muſt keepe all his graces: thou muſt neuer loſe him: keepe him ſtill, dislodge him not, dislodge rather all the worlde, than thou dislodge him: keepe him, and let him not goe: the happieſt gueſt that euer came, is when the Lord Ieſus is in the heart: hee is full of all joye: hee is full of all peace and conſolation: the laſt that thou muſt keepe in thine heart, is Ieſus Chriſt. So make vp faith of all theſe partes: there are the partes of it, To knowe God in Ieſus Chriſt, to vnderſtand him in his worde, and that which thou knoweſt, to

take it within thine heart. Wee ſhould not bee content of this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie: wee ſhoulde not bee content to gette CHRIST into our heartes, by a piece of knowledge, but ſenſiblie to feele him. And laſt, to keepe him, who is the Treaſure of all treaſures, and who hath giuen the treaſure of all knowledge, the moſt precious trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the worlde. Yee will keepe vp Treaſures and Hoordes in your Kiſtes: nowe keepe rather CHRIST into your heartes, than all the Hoordes in the worlde.</p>
            <p>Marke againe in the argument, the diuerſitie of the thinges which wee belieue, which are the objectes of fayth. If yee marke the wordes well, yee ſhall ſee this: Firſt, wee muſt belieue in IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS CHRIST; and ere wee belieue in him, wee muſt haue a ſight and a knowledge of him: and then wee muſt receiue IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS CHRIST himſelfe: and this hee declareth, when as hee ſayeth, Therefore haue they knowne that I came from thee. And againe, That I am ſent from thee. Wee muſt belieue the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, the LORD IESVS, to haue come from his Father. And againe, what is the next? They haue knowne theſe thinges which thou haſt giuen mee. The next thing that they belieue, is, That all ſtore of grace is in IESVS CHRIST. The next thing that thy fayth ſhoulde reach vnto, is, That thou gripe into thine heart, that ſtore of grace and glorie that is in IESVS CHRIST. The laſt thing that they belieue, is the worde of GOD concerning CHRIST. The Apoſtle Paul to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, <hi>Epiſt. 2. Chap. 5. verſ. 7.</hi> ſayeth, Wee liue nowe by fayth, and not by ſight. So long as wee liue Pilgrimes in this Earth, and dwell in this tabernacle, wee will not ſee the LORD IESVS face to face: but when wee are once flitted out of this earthlie bodie, wee ſhall ſee him face to face. All the ſight that wee haue of IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS CHRIST in this life, is but as in a mirrour, euen as one woulde ſee a mans face in a mirrour. And what is the mirrour wherein we ſee IESVS CHRIST? It is nothing but this word of the Goſpel, and this glorious Euangel of the bleſſed GOD, the faireſt mirrour that euer man or woman looked in: There they ſhall ſee the faireſt ſight that euer was. Therefore, the LORD he paſſeth not by this mirrour, when he ſetteth out fayth to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, They haue receiued thoſe wordes, ſayeth hee, which thou gaueſt to mee, and they haue kept thy wordes. The whole thing that is to bee belieued, is, Firſt, IESVS CHRIST: and next, That
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:16631:110"/>
all joye is in him, and that all ſtore of grace is in him: Laſt, the worde of Ieſus Chriſt, in the which his glorious face is ſeene, and ſhineth. Contemne not this mirrour, contemne not this Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel preached: for if thou contemne it, it ſhall paſſe thy power to gette grace: contemneſt thou it, thou ſhalt neuer taſte of life in this life, nor in the life to come. Woe to the contemners of the Goſpel! they ſhall neuer ſee Chriſt, in whome is all life, all joye, and all comfort, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Marke well, Brethren, when hee ſetteth out the fayth of the Diſciples, to the Father, hee ſpeaketh thereof in ſuch ſorte, that he directeth all to the glorie of the Father. Lord! ſo deare the glorie of the Father was to the Sonne! When hee ſpeaketh of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hee attributeth all the glorie to the Father: They haue knowne well, (ſayeth hee,) that I am come from thee, O Father. Then againe, They haue knowne, that whatſoeuer thing thou haſt giuen mee, it is from thee. There is the true knowledge of the grace of Ieſus Chriſt, when thou attributeſt all glorie to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: when thou belieueſt in Chriſt, belieue that the Father ſent him, and that the Father gaue him, to redeeme thee from death, and that hee is riſen, and aſcended to the Father: belieue that the Father raiſed him. The whole praiſe of faith in Chriſt, redoundeth to the Father. Whatſoeuer wee belieue in Chriſt, as when wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue his death, or his reſurrection, his glory in all fulneſſe, is the glory of the Father. Wee knowe this by experience, the faith that ſtriketh on Chriſt, paſſeth immediatly thorow that man, the Lord Ieſus, thorow that glorious perſon, &amp; neuer reſteth, till it leane on that Fountaine of all mercy and grace, the Father of our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. The Fountaine is the Father of our Lord. To ſpeake it in one worde, All this faith in Ieſus Chriſt that wee haue, redoundeth to the glory of the Father: And therfore, the laſt exhortation is, That our faith be in Ieſus Chriſt: for when we belieue in the Mediator, and leane vs ouer on him, then the heart paſſeth into that light, wherevnto there is none acceſſe, where that glorious perſon doth dwell, the Father of Ieſus Chriſt. Let not thy faith reſt, till it gette that ſweete apprehenſion of that glorious perſon, the Father, and hee will ſaue thee, and giue thee to his Sonne: To whome bee al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Elbeloued in the Lord Ieſus, in the ſeconde part of this Prayer the Lord prayeth for his Diſciples, whom hee was to leaue in the world behinde him, when he ſhould paſſe vp to the Heauens. Hee vſeth many arguments of his requeſt and petition which hee maketh to his Father: firſt, from their calling out of the world by the Goſpel, from their election and chooſing them from al eternity, from this that they were the Fathers, from this that they were giuen to him, from this that they belieued in the Father, and in him. Now in the wordes which wee haue read, firſt after many arguments, yea, a cloud of arguments all gathered together, the Lord concludeth his petition and prayer, and ſayth, <hi>O Father, I pray for them</hi>: As hee would ſaye, Seeing ſo many thinges concur in them, their vocation, their election, and the reſt, therfore I haue good cauſe to praye for them: I praye for them, O Father, that thou wouldeſt keepe them: it cannot be, but thou muſt keepe them vpon whome thou haſt ſhowne ſo many graces. Now happie are they, on whom God beginnes to ſhow any grace: for on whom he begins to ſhew grace once, there is none end of grace, but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually grace vpon grace: mercy followes mercy, till at the laſt, they bee glorified in the Heauens for euermore. But to goe forward.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:16631:111"/>When he hath ſaid, <hi>I pray for them,</hi> hee defineth them in ſpeciall, who they are for whom he prayeth: <hi>J pray nor for the world,</hi> ſayth he; not for the worlde, that is, not for the Reprobate, and the wicked of the world, but for them that thou haſt giuen me: theſe are they for whome hee prayeth: hee excludeth the reprobates from his prayers, he includeth only the Elect, whom the Father hath giuen him: for as the decreete of the election of God from all eternitie, was limited and bounded, al were not choſen, all men and women were not written vp in that Booke of Life; and euen as the gift that the Father gaue to the Sonne, was limited and bounded, hee gaue not all to the Son, he gaue not euerie man and woman in this world, but ſo many as hee had choſen to life euerlaſting, them hee gaue to the Sonne, and no moe. So I ſay, as the decreet of election is bounded, and as the gift of the Father to the Sonne is bounded; euen ſo the interceſsion of the Sonne to the Father is bounded: The Sonne intercedeth not with the Father for euery man and woman in this world: and whether ye look to the interceſsion by prayer, as ye ſee now he prayeth for the Choſen, and for his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in ſpeciall: whether yee looke to that interceſsion that was by his death, and by that ſacrifice, the Lord he prayeth not for all, that is a ſure thing. And when he died, he died not for all, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie for ſo many as the Father had choſen out from all eternity: and hauing choſen them out, he gaue them to his Sonne the mediator. Only the Lord in the worlde made interceſsion for theſe Choſen that are giuen him. So, Brethren, what ſhall wee ſay? bleſſed is that man or woman that is of that choſen number! and bleſſed is that perſon, whom the Father hath put into the handes of the Sonne! For, for him the Sonne maketh interceſsion: And woe is that ſoule that is not choſen, and is not put into the hands of the Sonne to be kept and redeemed by him! no interceſsion for that ſoule: the prayer of the Lord Ieſus appertaineth nothing to that ſoule: nothing abideth that ſoule, but anguiſhe and damnation euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtingly.</p>
            <p>So ye ſee how needfull a thing it is, to haue aſſurance of our ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, &amp; to be aſſured &amp; perſwaded in our harts, that we are of that choſen number, giuen to Ieſus Chriſt. This is the perſwaſion wee ſhould ſeeke in this life, if euer wee would haue comfort either in life or death: and wee ſhould a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e haue that reſpect of the life to come and ſet our hearts on another life, than this life. Therefore the thing that we ſhould ſeeke moſt, is to bee of the number of the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:16631:112"/>
Choſen, and to be one of the number of them who are in the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Ieſus Chriſt: But alas! wee are ſo beaſtlie and ſenſeleſſe, that wee thinke there is no life, no joye, no glorie, &amp;c. but in this life, ſuch is the blindneſſe and beaſtlineſſe of the nature of man.</p>
            <p>Nowe, Brethren, and if yee marke againe the wordes well, yee ſhall ſee a great difference betwixt the Prayer that Chriſt made, and betwixt the Prayer of the faythfull in the worlde: When wee pray for others, our prayer is confuſed: wee cannot ſeparate the Reprobate from the Elect: wee will praye for altogether, good and euill, becauſe wee knowe not who is choſen, and how is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate and caſten awaye. Then, when wee pray for the Elect, and for the Kirke, our prayer is but confuſed, and generall: wee cannot praye for euerie particulare man, or for euerie choſen one, becauſe wee knowe them not: but generallie wee recommende vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God the whole Kirke: this is the manner of our prayer. But it is farre otherwayes in this prayer which the Lorde maketh for his Diſciples, and for the Choſen. The Lorde prayeth for his Elect, but hee prayeth not for the Reprobate: and particularlie heereafter hee excludeth Iudas; becauſe the Lord knewe who was elect, and who was reprobate. Then againe, when hee prayeth for the Elect, hee prayeth not confuſedlie, as wee doe: but in his prayer his eye is ſet vpon euerie one of the Choſen particularlie. There was neuer one of the Choſen, that was that time that Chriſt was in the worlde, or was ſince the beginning of the worlde, or ſhall bee to the ende of the worlde, but the LORD prayed for euerie one of them particularlie: hee prayed for mee, and hee prayed for thee, and hee ſawe euerie one of vs before the beginning of the worlde, and nowe hee recommendeth vs to the Father. Thinke not, that the Lord Ieſus prayeth confuſedlie, and generallie for all men: no, hee prayeth particularlie for the Choſen: there is not one Choſen, but the eye of the Lord is vpon them all. Why? The Lorde knewe who was choſen: No, there was not one little one, yea, the pooreſt vpon the face of the earth, of the choſen number, but in that time hee had his eye vpon them, that the holie Spirit might flowe to them out of his death. When the Lord died, yee muſt not thinke, that hee died for all: hee died but for ſome: hee died not for anie reprobate: he ſeparateth the Elect from the Reprobate, by vertue of his death. When hee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered himſelfe to the death, his eye was ſet vpon euerie one of the Elect that was in the worlde: and when hee was going to death,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:16631:112"/>
hee ſaide in his heart, I will die for this ſinner, and this ſinner, &amp;c. His eye was vpon euerie one of them. Paul to the Galathians, <hi>Chap. 2. verſ. 20.</hi> knewe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this well: The life I liue nowe in the fleſhe (ſayeth the Apoſtle,) I liue by faith in the Sonne of God, who hath loued mee, and giuen himſelfe, not for the Choſen in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, but particularlie for mee. Well then, ſayeth Paul this wayes that hee died for him particularlie? And the Lord ſayde before his death, I haue a particulare eye to Paul. And howbeit hee was an enemie to Chriſt, at that time, perſecuting him in his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, yet hee ſayeth, I will die for Paul. Then euerie one of vs ſhoulde ſaye, as Paul ſayde, Not generallie the Lord loued the worlde, that Lord gaue himſelfe for the Elect: but particularlie, the Lord loued mee, and the Lord loued thee; and, the Lord died for thee, and died for mee; and the Lord had an eye to mee in his death, and a reſpect to mee in his prayer, &amp;c. This particulare reſpect which the Lord had to mee, furniſheth great comforte, when I conſider it: for if the Prince had a reſpect to anie parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culare perſon, hee woulde bee greatlie comforted: and ſhoulde not this particulare reſpect of the LORD IESVS, King of all kinges, comfort vs? No, there is not one Choſen in this life, but the Sonne of God, in his death, had a particulare reſpect vnto them, not generallie, but particularlie: His eye was on eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one of vs: hee beſtowed not confuſedlie a common benefite vpon vs, without regarde who gotte it: No, hee knewe well, to whome the leaſt ſparke, or droppe, of that bloode ſhoulde ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine.</p>
            <p>Nowe to goe forwarde: <hi>But J pray,</hi> ſayeth the Lord, <hi>for them that thou haſt giuen mee: For all mine, are thine; and thine are mine: and I am glorified in them.</hi> It might haue beene ſayde, If thou haſt gotten them, what haue I to doe with them? The LORD meeteth this: No, they are thine: not onelie were they thine, but, Lorde, they are thine yet, and ſhall remaine thine euerlaſtinglie: Whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer thou haſt giuen mee, I take them not out of thine hande, but euer they continue thine. So, Brethren, hee reaſoneth ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerallie, All mine are thine, and thine are mine: whatſoeuer thing I haue, is thine; and whatſoeuer thing thou haſt, is mine: therefore I take them not out of thine hande, for they are thine, as well as mine. The wordes are plaine: wee vſe to ſay commonlie, All thinges are common amongſt friendes. And PAVL alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth in his EPISTLE to PHILEMON, That friendſhippe
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:16631:113"/>
amongſt men, will make the goods which they haue to bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon amongſt them: Yee ſee by experience, Matrimonie maketh common geare, betwixt the man and the woman: but there is an higher and ſtraiter conjunction betwixt the Father and the Sonne, that maketh all thinges betwixt them more common, than anie conjunction in this world. That conjunction is in one nature, and in one eſſence: The Father and the Sonne is but one God, bleſſed for euermore, Amen. There is an higher conjunction, than anie that can be found amongſt the creatures. And as this conjunction is of one nature, and of one eſſence, ſo is it alſo of one glory, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and majeſty. It is true, they differ in perſons: the Father is the firſt perſon of that glorious Trinitie, and the Sonne is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond perſon of that glorious Trinitie: yet they are both one God, in eſſence, and in ſubſtance. Now, thorow this conjunction it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe, that that which is the Fathers, is the Sonnes; and that which is the Sonnes, is the Fathers: ſo all is common betwixt them: the whole world is as it were common good betwixt them: the Elect are common, &amp; as it were, common good betwixt them. But here is the difference: marke it, Brethren, the firſt right is the Fathers, I meane, the firſt right, by order, all appertaineth firſt to the Father, becauſe hee is the firſt perſon, in order of that glorious Trinitie. Then the next right of all things, is the Sonnes, and it is equall with the Fathers right, but a ſeconde right: becauſe the right that the Sonne hath, it is by conjunction: the Father hath all of himſelfe, he hath it not from the Sonne, becauſe he is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the Trinitie. All that which the Sonne hath, is of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, euen that glorious eſſence it ſelfe, let bee the thinges of the worlde. Looke whatſoeuer the Sonne hath gotten, he hath gotten it by gift of the Father: Yet the Father hath not ſo reſigned all quite ouer to the Sonne, that hee hath denuded himſelfe of all, howbeit all be common betwixt them, but the thing which is the Fathers hee keepeth it ſtill, yet by gift, hee maketh it the Sonnes: So that donation taketh nothing awaye of the right of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe that donation is not ſo much a donation, as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication. Not only giueth hee all things readily to the Sonne, but hee communicateth all thinges with the Sonne: ſo this is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther communication, than donation: for whatſoeuer thing the Father giueth to the Sonne, the Father keepeth ſtill the ſame euerlaſtingly. As for vs, Brethren, what ſhal we ſay more but this? Nowe bleſſed is that man or woman, that is of this communitie,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:16631:113"/>
and of this common good betwixt the Father and the Sonne! For he or ſhe that is of that common good, betwixt the Father and the Sonne, let them bee aſſured, that the common care of the Father and of the Sonne, ſhall watch ouer them euerlaſtingly: the Father ſhall keepe them, and the Sonne ſhall keepe them euerlaſtinglie: as I ſpake before, it is a wonderfull thing to conſider the grounds of our ſaluation, and what care and prouidence the Father and the Sonne haue of the choſen ones, and howe faſt our ſaluation ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth: ſo if wee had a ſure perſwaſion, and a liuely faith of the grounds of our ſaluation, we would not bee ſo toſſed with doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting as we are concerning our ſaluation, but pleaſantly and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie we would repoſe vpon the care which the Father and the Sonne haue ouer vs: But alace! there is ſuch a ſlough of ſinne vpon our ſoules, and wee are ſo ſenſeleſſe, that wee cannot ſee the groundes wherevpon our ſaluation ſtandeth.</p>
            <p>But to goe forward: Yet he continueth in argumentes and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to mooue his Father to keepe his Diſciples: wee haue heard fiue: now hee beginneth the ſixth, <hi>I am glorified in them,</hi> that is, in my Diſciples: therefore, Father, keepe them: as thou reſpecteſt my glory, O Father, ſo keepe them, becauſe I am glorified in them: they haue glorified me by faith in me, by confeſsion of me, and in their life and conuerſation. Theſe are the wayes wherein the Sonne is glorified, by faith in him, by confeſsion of his Name, and by an holy life and conuerſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion before the worlde: without the which, all thy profeſsion is but counterfaite: and al is vanity, if thy life anſwere not to thy profeſsion. So if this bee an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the Sonne vſeth to his Father, to moue him to keepe his Diſciples, certainely it followeth, that whoſoeuer findeth in their heartes, that they haue glorified the Sonne, in belieuing in him, in confeſsing of him, and in their life and conuerſation, that man, or that woman, may bee aſſured in their heart, and ſaye, The Father keepeth me, and I am in his cuſtodie; &amp; I am aſſured, that the Father hath a ſpeciall care ouer mee, becauſe I finde my delite and pleaſure to be ſet on Chriſt: No, no, if the Father had not mee in his cuſtodie, I ſhould not haue ſuch a pleaſure and delite to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie him. The heart that findeth no delite nor pleaſure to glorifie Chriſt Ieſus in this life, hath no warrand that it is in the keeping and cuſtodie of the Father: if thou findeſt no faith at no time: and if thy life in ſome meaſure anſwere not to thy profeſsion, ſaye, The care of the Father is not ouer me, I am deſolate, I am not in Gods
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:16631:114"/>
handes: that is the moſt deſolate creature in the worlde, whome the Father hath not in his cuſtodie, yea, though all the worlde ſhould compaſſe him and guard him round about. And by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, whome the Father hath a care of, they are better guarded than if all the Kings of the Earth were about them: for, Brethren, yee may well know, that the Father loueth that perſon well, that loueth his welbeloued: for he who loueth the Sonne, the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, he loueth the Father alſo, and the Father loueth him: and hee who honoureth the Sonne, the Father ſhall honour him. And by the contrary, he who diſhonoureth the Sonne, the Father ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour him, and ſhame him, in deſpite of all the worlde; albeit all the world ſhould honour him, he will haue him ſhamed, he ſhal ſet him vp to be an open ſhame to man and Angel: he ſhall be <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema,</hi> yea, and <hi>Anathema Maranatha,</hi> that is, curſed for euer, who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not the Lord Ieſus. There is ſuch a ſtrait and narrow conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction betwixt the Father and the Son, that the honour of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is the honour of the Sonne; and the honour of the Sonne, is the honour of the Father: and that the diſhonour of the Sonne, is the diſhonour of the Father: and the hatred of the Sonne, is the hatred of the Father alſo. Ye heard what Chriſt ſaid, Hee who ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth me, he honoureth him who ſent me. A Prince will thinke that his Ambaſſadour ſhoulde bee as well reuerenced as himſelfe: for all the honour that the Ambaſſadour receiueth, commeth to the Prince, who ſent him. Now the Sonne of God, is more than an Ambaſſadour ſent by the Father; for he is not a ſimple Ambaſſador, but alſo the Sonne of God, equall with the Father, who is more than all the Ambaſſadours in the world. Will not then the Father thinke, that the honour done to the Sonne, whom hee hath ſent, is done to himſelfe? Yes certainlie.</p>
            <p>But to leaue this: Yet he continueth on, and bringeth other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, &amp; heapeth argument vpon argument, to ſhew that great deſire which he had, that the Father ſhould keepe and ſaue his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, who were in the world, <hi>J am no more in the world, I goe away,</hi> and concerning my bodily preſence, <hi>I am no more with them,</hi> they will abide ſtill in the world, therfore, <hi>O Father, keepe them,</hi> in reſpect that I leaue them to thee, and I am to goe out of the worlde, and that ſhortlie, therefore take thou the care of them. Euen as a man dying, leaueth them whom he loueth well, to tender friendes: Euen ſo the Lord Ieſus, leaueth his Diſciples to his Father, that he ſhould take them in his cuſtodie. When I was with them, ſaith
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:16631:114"/>
hee, I kept them, but nowe I am going out of the worlde, and I leaue them vnto thee, therefore, Father, keepe them.</p>
            <p>Brethren, this abſence of Chriſt in his bodie, and our abſence from him, it is ſo farre from that, to bee an argument, that God hath left vs, that by the contrarie, this abſence of Ieſus Chriſt, in his bodilie preſence, and the leauing of vs behinde him now in the Earth, it is an argument to euerie one of vs, that God is with vs, and that the Father of Ieſuſt Chriſt, hath a ſpeciall care of vs: for looke, the farder that Ieſus Chriſt bee from vs in his bodilie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, the nearer is the Father vnto vs, by his holie Spirite, that Comforter: So that yee woulde thinke it a wonderfull thing, to conſider the care that the Father hath of vs, in the abſence of Ieſus Chriſt from vs. It is good for vs, that Ieſus Chriſt, our Lord, went to the Heauens in glorie: And Chriſt ſayeth himſelfe, If I goe not awaye, that Comforter, the Holie Spirite, ſhall not come. And this is ſure, the more deſolate that anie bee in this Earth, as the Fatherleſſe, Widdowes, and Strangers, &amp;c. if they bee Chriſtes, the greater is the care of God ouer them. So, yee will finde in the SCRIPTVRES, hee will take into his hande, and haue a ſpeciall care of the Widdowes, and Fatherleſſe, ſo that they bee Ieſus Chriſtes, and once giuen to him. If thou bee deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, looke that thou bee Ieſus Chriſtes: and if thou wouldeſt not want the ſocietie of Ieſus Chriſt, aboue all, beware of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie, which is nothing, but the beginning of that euerlaſting deſolation. Woulde wee haue joye or conſolation in anie deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late eſtate in the worlde? Woulde wee haue that preſence of God, and that conſolation of the Holie Spirite? No more but this, See that thou bee Chriſtes: for Heauen and Earth ſhall goe together, and all ſhall turne to nothing, ere the Lorde bee not with thee, to keepe thee, and to guarde thy ſoule: as the Apoſtle ſayeth to the PHILIPPIANS, with that peace with paſſeth all vnderſtanding: Hee will ſet that peace into thine heart, when thou art in trouble, and hee will ſet thine heart at reſt, and giue thee a greater peace, than all the peace in the worlde.</p>
            <p>Nowe, when hee hath repeated theſe argumentes, hee conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ſhortlie, <hi>Holie Father, keepe them in thy</hi> NAME, <hi>them whome thou haſt giuen mee, that they maye bee one with vs, as wee are one.</hi> Marke, Brethren, theſe wordes which the LORD vttereth, haue a great weight, and alſo this petition which hee maketh to the Father, it is full of affection, and loue: And it is full of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:16631:115"/>
affection, firſt to the Father, &amp; then to the Diſciples, for whom he prayeth: It is full of affection to him whom to hee prayeth, &amp; to them for whoſe cauſe he prayeth. Looke when thou prayeſt, that thy affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be to thy God, &amp; to them alſo for whom thou prayeſt. Hee ſayeth, <hi>Holie Father, keepe them.</hi> Will yee conſider euerie worde, and firſt theſe wordes, <hi>Holie Father,</hi> yee ſhall perceiue a great affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the Sonne, to the Father. Theſe wordes riſe on two mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues; the one is loue, that is an affection which the Sonne bare to the Father. When he calleth him Father, he vttreth that wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full loue which he bare to the Father. And then the other riſeth on a great reuerence, that Ieſus Chriſt our Lord bare to his Father, when hee calleth him <hi>Holie</hi>: for as hee loued him, ſo hee reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him: Holineſſe craueth reuerence. And that holie God, what reuerence ought hee to haue? Hee ſhould not bee named, nor thought on, but with reuerence of the heart.</p>
            <p>Then hee ſayeth, <hi>And keepe them in thy Name</hi>: that is, by thy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine power. This worde riſeth on a confidence of a wonderfull power in the Father, that hee was able to defende and keepe them, in none other Name, but in his owne. Nowe looke the diſpoſition of the heart of Ieſus Chriſt: In praying the heart is diſpoſed with a wonderfull reuerence, and loue to his Father. And, Brethren, I count this argument of all the argumentes that yee haue hearde, (howbeit they were verie manie, mightie, and ſtrong<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) this ſame diſpoſition of the heart, I ſay, to bee one of the moſt forcibleſt to mooue the Father. The inwarde diſpoſition of the heart of the Lord Ieſus, in loue and reuerence, is moſte forcible to mooue the Father to keepe his Diſciples. Looke in prayer, to the diſpoſition of thine heart: for when wee praye to God, what do we all argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes? Wherefore auaileth it to heape on argumentes to mooue God, if thou haſt no good diſpoſition in thine heart in prayer? Wherefore vſeſt thou wordes, when thou haſt an vnbelieuing heart? and when thou haſt no loue nor reuerence, nor no confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in God? And then againe, when the heart of man, or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, is well diſpoſed in praying, with an holie affection to God in Ieſus Chriſt, with a reuerence, and with a confidence in him, then fewe wordes and fewe argumentes will ſerue. It is better to haue fewe wordes in praying, with loue and faith, and with an holie diſpoſition, than to praye all the daye without the inwarde diſpoſition. <hi>James</hi> ſayeth, <hi>Chap. 5. verſ. 16. The prayer of a faithfull man auaileth much, if it bee ſeruent.</hi> He ſayeth not, If hee vſe manie reaſons
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:16631:115"/>
or wordes: but if hee haue a zeale to the glorie of God in prayer, then it is acceptable. This is knowne by experience: they who knowe the diſpoſition of the heart, they will account more of it, than of all the worlde. So yee ſee, this diſpoſition in the heart of Ieſus Chriſt, is the chiefe argument to mooue the Father: hee had no ſinne in him, his heart was cleane, and his loue was perfect, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout anie mixture of hatred, or anie other ſinfull infirmitie. All our affection, our loue, and our confidence, is full of ſinne, and all is troubled in our heartes: and if wee gette anie libertie, it is but ſmall. Alace! this is the fouleneſſe of our ſoule: but well is that ſoule that getteth anie loue, or anie confidence, or anie reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Nowe to come to the affection to them for whome the Lord prayeth: <hi>J praye euen for them whome thou haſt giuen mee.</hi> No queſtion, when hee ſayeth, <hi>Whome thou haſt giuen mee,</hi> hee taketh them into his heart, hee imbraceth them into the affection of the heart: the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection gripeth to them, when as hee calleth them his. No, if the Lord Ieſus call thee his, hee will take thee into his heart, and his affection will gripe thee. Nowe certainelie, as the affection to his Father was a great argument in the ſight of the Father, ſo when wee praye to God for others, the affection towardes others is a great argument to mooue God. And as wee reſpect the one, hauing a zeale and an affection to God, ſo wee ſhould reſpect the other, hauing true loue towardes others. Looke that thine heart hate not the perſon of him for whome thou prayeſt: otherwayes, thou ſcorneſt God in thy prayer: and when thou prayeſt for anie, looke that thou loue that perſon: for the loue of God, and the loue of the perſon for whome thou prayeſt, is aye joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. If thou loueſt not the perſon for whome thou prayeſt, it is ſure, thou loueſt not God.</p>
            <p>Farder, it is to bee conſidered heere, that ſince the beginning of this prayer, this argument is oft repeated, <hi>Them whome thou hast giuen mee.</hi> This is the thirde time that it is repeated. The firſt is in theſe wordes, <hi>J haue declared thy Name vnto the men which thou gaueſt mee out of the worlde.</hi> And then, <hi>I praye not for the worlde, but for them whome thou haſt giuen mee.</hi> And againe, <hi>Holie Father, keepe them in thy Name, euen them whome thou haſt giuen mee,</hi> &amp;c. Hee hath not ſo often repeated anie other argument as this, They are thy Choſen, they are called by the preaching of the Goſpel: but hee hath doubled
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:16631:116"/>
and tripled this argument: there is ſome grounde of this: this muſt bee the moſte ſpeciall thing that mooued the LORD to praye for his Diſciples, becauſe they were giuen to him, and the Father had concredited them vnto him, and put them into his handes: And therefore hee letteth it neuer goe out of his heart, that the Father had giuen them vnto him: Father, (ſayeth hee,) thou haſt giuen them vnto mee, therefore, Father, keepe them. There is not a faythfull man or woman, but if GOD will concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite anie to their care and protection, the moſte ſpeciall thing that will mooue them to haue a care of them, is, That GOD hath concredited them vnto them: Therefore they will praye vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to GOD for them. And euen by the contrarie, they who haue not a reſpect to them who are concredited vnto them, for this cauſe, that GOD hath put ſuch perſons into their handes, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for them; that perſon, ſayeth the Apoſtle Paul, is worſe than an Infidell: That perſon who hath gotten a Familie to care for, and neglecteth it, is worſe than an Infidell. So this ſhoulde mooue vs to care for others, becauſe the LORD hath concredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them vnto vs: And in the daye of Iudgement, it ſhall bee aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked at thee, Where is the care that thou hadſt of them, whome I concredited vnto thy charge? And then terrible ſhall it bee for them, who haue neglected thoſe whome the LORD hath giuen vnto them.</p>
            <p>As hee vſeth this argument to mooue the Father, ſo the Father muſt haue a care on that which hee hath giuen to CHRIST: And that perſon that will take care of their Familie, or of the Kirke, or Common-wealth, the LORD ſhall meete him, and haue a care ouer him. So that whoſoeuer hath gotten the charge of ſoules, or of Families, or of Common-wealthes, they ſhoulde haue a care ouer them: for let bee that it is vngodlie, not to bee carefull; it is an vnnaturall thing. Woe to the men, that will runne out, and drinke, and leaue their Familie, and runne, and raſhe, and fill themſelues, and haue no care of them whom GOD hath put vnder their handes! Woe to them that runne, and leaue their Kirke! Woe to that man that hath no care ouer them that GOD hath concredited vnto his charge.</p>
            <p>Hee ſayeth, <hi>That they may bee one, as wee are one.</hi> Keepe them, that they may bee like vs. No, all our bleſſedneſſe, is, to bee like the Father, the Sonne, and that Holie Spirite. Wherein ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:16631:116"/>
it? It ſtandeth in an vnitie, to wit, That as the Father and the Sonne are one, not onelie in that mutuall loue, but in that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Godhead, ſubſtance, and eſſence, that is that vnitie, one GOD, the Father, the Sonne, and the Holie Spirite, ſo wee alſo are one. Nowe, it is not required, that wee bee one in eſſence, but one in heartes and ſoules: that is to ſaye, Let euerie one of vs loue another, let peace bee amongſt vs, and in this point wee muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent GOD: and this is that vnitie, that our heartes bee joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with others in loue: No man is knitte to CHRIST, or yet to the Father, but in loue: and when wee are knitte vnto them, our heartes are knitte euerie one to another. So in one worde, when wee ſee loue amongſt men, and eſpeciallie amongſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, when wee ſee their heartes joyned in loue, wee may ſaye, The Father keepeth theſe, becauſe they are in vnitie one with another, and hee hath a care ouer them, or elſe they coulde neuer haue this vnitie of minds in loue: And where there is nothing but diſſention, and euerie one byting and backe-byting another, they are not in the cuſtodie of GOD: for if they were in his keeping, they woulde bee one, as the Father and the Sonne are one. So, in one worde, the LORDES care is not ouer thoſe. Therefore, as euer yee woulde bee ſure, that the LORD hath a care ouer you, looke that yee haue an vnitie amongſt your ſelues: And this is it that the Apoſtle Paul moſte recommendeth vnto vs, an vnitie of minde. So, as wee woulde teſtifie vs to bee the members of IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS CHRIST, let vs bee in vnitie with our neighbour: for by this wee teſtifie to the worlde, that wee are GODS, and giuen to IESVS CHRIST: and where there is no loue, no amitie, there the members are not joyned with the Head, and wee haue no part with CHRIST: for where fayth is, there is loue: and where fayth is, there the members will concur together in vnitie of minde.</p>
            <p>The LORD giue vs fayth in IESVS CHRIST, in whome ſtandeth all our happineſſe, and felicitie: and to whome, with the Father, and the Holie Spirite, bee all honour, prayſe, power, and dominion, for euermore.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the ſecond part of this Prayer (Welbeloued in the Lord Ieſus) the Lord being to depart out of this life, and to riſe againe, and to aſcend vp to the Heauens, he recommendeth his Diſciples, whome he was to leaue behinde him, to the keeping and preſeruation of the Father. To this purpoſe hee hath ſundry arguments and reaſons: Firſt, ſayeth he, <hi>I haue manifested thy Name to them, therefore, Father, keepe them.</hi> Then, <hi>Thou hast choſen them out of the worlde from all eternitie, therefore, Father, keepe them.</hi> Then, <hi>They were thine, therefore, Father, keepe thine owne.</hi> And againe, <hi>Thou haſt giuen them to mee, therefore keepe them.</hi> And againe, <hi>They haue kept thy worde, and belieued in mee, that thou haſt ſent mee, therefore keepe them.</hi> And againe, <hi>I am glorified in them, therefore keepe them.</hi> And laſt of all, <hi>I am to leaue them behinde mee in the worlde, therefore keepe them.</hi> Theſe arguments and reaſons wee haue heard. Nowe hee goeth forwarde, and addeth to the eight reaſon, beginning at the Text which wee haue read. The eight reaſon is from his owne keeping of his Diſciples, while hee abode with them in the world: <hi>While J
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:16631:117"/>
was with them in the worlde, I kept them in thy Name, and ſaued them: And thoſe whome thou gauest to mee, I haue kept; ſo that there is not one of them loſt, ſaue one, the ſonne of perdition</hi>: meaning <hi>Iudas, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture might mee fulfilled</hi>: euen that Scripture, which fore-tolde of his deſtruction: therefore I kept them ſo long as I was with them: Now, Father, I recommende them vnto thee, and I put them into thine hand.</p>
            <p>Yet the words would bee better weighed: This keeping of his Diſciples he amplifieth by ſundry circumſtances: The firſt circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, is, A carefulneſſe, diligence, and earneſtneſſe in keeping them. This carefulneſſe appeareth in doubling of the words: hee is not content to ſay once, <hi>J haue kept them</hi>: but he ſayth it ouer again. The Sonne of God, the Lord Ieſus, whom he keepeth, hee keepeth them faithfully, and carefully: not ſlackly, but diligently: night and day his eye is vpon them: and as hee himſelfe ſayth, <hi>O Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem! as the Henne gathereth her Birdes vnder her winges, ſo would I haue done to thee.</hi> And no doubt, the Lord gathereth his owne, vnder the wings of his grace, and keepeth them after a moſt tender and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiere faſhion of keeping. So wee may learne at his example, thoſe whom God hath concredited vnto vs, to be kept in this world by vs, whether they bee in our Familie, whether they be in the Kirke of God, or whether they bee in the Policie, or Commonwealth, whereſoeuer they be, one or moe, how many or how few they be, who are concredited vnto vs, and giuen out of the hand of God to be kept and defended in this world by vs. Wee learne heere by the example of Chriſt, to keepe them ſo carefullie and faithfullie, that they loſe not in our hand. The Prophet ſayeth, <hi>Woe to them that doeth the worke of the Lord negligentlie and ſlacklie. Ierem. 48. verſ. 10.</hi> There hee meaneth, Who ſlayeth not, and wracketh not, as the Lord commandeth to ſlay and wracke: Therefore, much more, ſhall woe &amp; curſe appertaine vnto them, who keepeth not them faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, whom the Lord hath concredited vnto them, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them to keepe. If woe was denounced againſt them who ſlewe not, and wracked not, at the commandement of the Lord, a double woe ſhall appertaine vnto them, who neglecteth them whom the Lord hath concredited to their charge.</p>
            <p>Nowe I come to the ſeconde circumſtance, <hi>J haue kept them in they Name</hi>: that is to ſay, By thy vertue and power. All the power that the Sonne hath, hee hath it giuen him of the Father: and all the power that the Sonne hath, is the power of the Father: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:16631:118"/>
he acknowledgeth the keeping of theſe Diſciples, to be by the power of the Father: and ſo he glorifieth his Father in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. The Sonne in any thing that he doth, he euer glorifieth the Father. Who is he in this world, who is able to keepe a ſoule by his owne power? Who hath power in his own hand, to keepe a body, or a Child, or the meaneſt thing whatſoeuer? There is no fleſh that hath power to keepe the leaſt in their Family: No, a King hath no power to keepe a poore body in his Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, except the LORD look down from Heauen, and wait vpon that body, which he hath concredited to his keeping. And therefore, ſeeing none of vs hath power to keep one, except we haue power of God from Heauen, then let euery man take heed to his ſpeaking: Let Kings take heed to their ſpeaking: let thoſe that haue Families take heed to their ſpeaking: let them who are ſet ouer the Kirke, take heed to their ſpeaking: let none ſay, I haue done this: let no fleſh ſtand vp, and ſay, I haue brought ſuch and ſuch good works to perfection by my fore-ſight, wiſedome, and power: The LORD ſhall take all power from thee, and turne it into ſhame, if thou glorifieſt not him who hath giuen thee po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and ſayeſt not, I haue kept them by the power of GOD. PAVL ſayth, <hi>I haue laboured more than they all</hi>: But, <hi>not I, but the grace of GOD in mee.</hi> So, beware of your ſpeaking: blaſpheme not the LORD in ſpeaking: when ye haue done it, ſay, GOD hath done it, what was I, but a poore Inſtrument, raiſed vp by the power of GOD?</p>
            <p>I go forward to the third circumſtance, whereby he amplifieth this keeping: It is from the cauſe moouing him: <hi>Theſe whome thou gaueſt mee, J kept.</hi> The cauſe was, The Father had put them into his hands: that was the chiefeſt reſpect that he had in keping his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. Well, Brethren, there are many cauſes wherfore we ſhould keep them whom GOD hath concredited vnto vs: but ſurely this ſhould be the chiefeſt, that ſhould mooue vs to wait on them, and night and day to care for them, becauſe GOD hath put them into our hands, &amp; deliuered them to vs, to be kept by vs. We ſhould ay remember on this, The Lord hath put them in my hand, and I muſt make anſwere for them, at the Great day of the Lord. Yea if the leaſt one of them periſh through thy default, the blood ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at thy hand. Look the Acts of th'Apoſtles, <hi>Chap. 20. verſ. 28.</hi> where <hi>Paul,</hi> when he had called the Kirke together, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to the Elders of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and ſayth, <hi>Take heede to your ſelues, and to all the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:16631:118"/>
flocke, whereof the holie Ghoſt hath made you ouer-ſeers, to feede the Kirke of God,</hi> &amp;c. This is his exhortation. The firſt band that he binds them with, is this, The holy Ghoſt hath made you ouer-ſeers for them: and ye muſt make anſwere for euery one of them: Night and day, therefore, take heed to them. Another band which he binds them with, is, <hi>Hee hath ſhed his blood for them.</hi> So, if we would be carefull to keepe them, whom GOD hath giuen vs, this muſt be the firſt, GOD hath concredited theſe, and theſe, to me: therefore as I ſhall anſwere at that Great day, I muſt keep them. No, thou dareſt not ſtand vp before that terrible Tribunall ſeat, if thou keep them not faythfully, whom the LORD hath concredited vnto thee. It is no ſmall matter for a King to keep a Common-wealth: or for a Magiſtrat to keep them who are concredited vnto him: Yea, will the King make his paſtime of it, that he hath gotten ſuch a care? Will a Miniſter take his paſtime, who hath gotten the care of a Kirke? Or a man, or a woman, who hath gotten a Family, ſhall they take their paſtime, without regard? Is this the end wherfore God hath concredited thoſe to them? No, heauy ſhall thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be, if one periſh through thy default: the blood of that one ſhall be required at thy hands.</p>
            <p>Now we come to the fourth circumſtance: The fourth circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is the effect that followed this carefull keeping of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. The effect was this, <hi>Neuer one was loſt,</hi> who was giuen to him, of his Diſciples, who were twelue, <hi>except</hi> one, <hi>Judas, the ſon of perdition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> that is, a man addicted to deſtruction, and wrack; to the end <hi>that the Scripture might be fulfilled.</hi> There is an higher cauſe than this: that is, To the end that that decree which God made concerning <hi>Iudas,</hi> &amp; his perdition, ſhould ſtand. The Scripture was but a reuelation of that Decree: for as GOD is immutable, ſo his Decree ſhould ſtand, that <hi>Iudas</hi> ſhould be condemned.</p>
            <p>Well, Brethren, ye ſee a faire effect that followeth a careful kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping: <hi>None are loſt,</hi> becauſe the Sonne keepeth them: he glorifieth the Father in his keeping, becauſe the Father had concredited them vnto him: and therfore it followeth wel, that ſeeing he kept them, none was loſt, but <hi>Iudas.</hi> Where a man is faithfull in keping, &amp; careful night &amp; day to preſerue them who are concredited vnto him, becauſe God hath giuen them vnto him, firſt he glorifies God in keeping them: next, by his faithfull keeping he procures the eye of God to be ay watching ouer them: and laſt of all, certainly that man will ſee a faire effect of his care &amp; keeping: None ſhalbe loſt,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:16631:119"/>
except thoſe who are ſeparate to be ſons of perdition, as <hi>Iudas</hi> was: that is, who are ordained to deſtruction from all eternity: For, Brethren, thoſe who are ordained to deſtruction, made veſſels of wrath &amp; perdition, who are appointed to hell euerlaſtingly, all the keeping in the world will not keep them: all the careful attenda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in the world wil not ſaue them. Al the keeping of Chriſt, who was more careful than any man in the world, could not keep <hi>Iudas</hi> from deſtruction. So, who are ordained to deſtruction, no keeping ſhall ſerue them, but they ſhall periſh euerlaſtingly. It may be, that the ſonnes of perdition may be kept in an outward Diſcipline; but at laſt they ſhall be manifeſted to be but hypocrites: they ſeeme to be the Children of Light: and who will put a difference betwixt them, and thoſe who are ordained to ſaluation? Who will put a difference betwixt <hi>Iudas,</hi> and the reſt of the Diſciples for a time? <hi>Judas</hi> ſeemed an Apoſtle for the time, as well as <hi>Matthew, James,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the reſt. So for a time, they who are ordained for death, will ſeeme to be kept, and they will heare the Preaching, and who will be ſo earneſt to take heed as they? But howbeit they giue a faire ſhow outwardly in their behauiour, in the end, behold, there ſhall a ſhamefull deſtruction befall them: and let them ſhow to the world what they will, they ſhall ſhow themſelues to be Apoſtates from Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Therefore, Brethren, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e neuer content of an outward profeſſion, till that ye find your ſelues on a ſure ground: and reſt not, till that by fayth and regeneration, ye get an aſſurance of your election: and till that ye be ſure, that God hath made a decree, that ye ſhall haue life euerlaſting. And when ye ſee men and women, who ſeeme to ſtand, fall away, &amp; make a foule defection, it is an euill token. This for the foure circumſtances: He kept them carefully, and in the Name of his Father: becauſe the Father had giuen them him, he was the more carefull of them: and therefore it followeth, that none was loſt, but <hi>Iudas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let vs come to the concluſion: Therefore, Father, <hi>I ſpeake theſe thinges</hi>: that is, I recommende them vnto thee, that thou ſhouldeſt keep them: <hi>I come to thee</hi>: I leaue them now here. It would ſeeme, that Chriſt, when hee went out of this worlde, hee left his owne ſo in the worlde, that hee had no more the keeping and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtodie of them, and that, as it were, that hee denudeth his hands of them: this would mooue anie man. Now, Brethren, the Lord Ieſus neuer denuded his hands of his Diſciples: he neuer gaue quite ouer
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:16631:119"/>
them whom he once kept: but this is the meaning of his wordes, when hee died hee ceaſed to keepe them in that manner that hee kept them before when hee was in the worlde: for when hee was with them in the world, he kept them by his bodily preſence, and went before them, and they followed after him. This keeping cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed when Chriſt went out of the worlde: but as for that keeping which is the ſpirituall keeping, it neuer ceaſeth to the ende of the world: And the Lord now in the Heauen, hee keepeth more ſurely his owne by his Spirit, than he kept his Diſciples when he was in the worlde with them. And all this keeping that hee requireth at the Fathers hand, is, That he ſhould keepe them by him. No kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the Father, but by the Sonne, who is glorified in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, at the right hand of the Father.</p>
            <p>Wel, Brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we ſee of this argument thus far, They whom the Lord Ieſus died for, and they whom he kept in this world, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Ieſus Chriſt keepeth them in the abſence of Ieſus Chriſt, till the Lord come againe in his body. Looke whome to the Lord had an eye, when hee was in the earth humbled, whoſoeuer they were to whome hee had an eye, the Father, from his vp-going to the Heauen, till his comming againe, hath an eye to them, and watcheth ouer them. It is true, wee who liue this day, (I meane the Elect,) wee were not then with Ieſus Chriſt, as his Diſciples were, and he kept not vs after the manner that he kept his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, becauſe wee were not: Yet there is not ſo much as one of the Elect that nowe are, or yet ſhall bee heereafter, to the ende of the worlde, but Ieſus Chriſt, euen humbled, had his eye vpon them: and before they came into the world, many yeeres, he loued them: and therefore it followeth, if thy conſcience will teſtifie to thee, that Ieſus Chriſt our Lorde, when hee was humbled in the earth, when hee prayed for ſinners, and when hee died in the earth; if, I ſay, thy conſcience will teſtifie vnto thee, and ſay, My Lord had an eye to mee, as well as to <hi>Peter,</hi> in his death, and as hee had to <hi>Iohn, Iames, Matthew,</hi> &amp;c. certainly thou mayeſt bee aſſured, that the eye of the Father of Ieſus Chriſt watcheth ouer thee, till Ieſus Chriſt come againe. <hi>Paul</hi> was not conuerſant with Chriſt, as the reſt were into the earth: for <hi>Paul</hi> was called after the Aſcenſion of Chriſt, when he was glorified: yet <hi>Paul</hi> ſayeth, The Sonne of God, in whom he belieued, loued him, and gaue himſelfe for him. <hi>Galat. Chap. 2. verſ. 20.</hi> Meaning, that Chriſt, when he died, hee had a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to him. The reſpect which Chriſt had in his death to <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:16631:120"/>
the ſame he had to euery choſen man, and woman, to the end of the world: And therefore ſay thou, that when Chriſt died, he died for me, and he loued me, and his eye was vpon me. If thou canſt ſay this, thou art in the cuſtody and keeping of the Father, till Ieſus Chriſt come againe. There is another thing to be marked here: What maketh the Sonne ſo bold, to ſtand vp before the Father, and deſire him to keepe his Diſciples, whom he ſhould leaue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him, when he was going vp to Heauen? Looke the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: I haue kept them faythfully, therefore, Father, in mine ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, keepe thou them. Who dare be ſo bold to face God, once to bid him keep them, whom he hath concredited vnto them? What King in the world, dare be ſo bold, to pray for his Subjects, (the King is bound aſwell to pray for his Subjects, as the Subjects are for the King, or as a Miniſter is for his Flock) &amp; ſay, O Lord, keep theſe Subjects? And what Miniſter dare be bold to ſay, Lord, keep my Flock, or Family? None but he who hath a conſcience that he did his duety, and was diligent night &amp; day in keeping them. No man dare reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend any to God, who hath not a care to keep them whom God hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>credited vnto him: And therfore, theſe careles bodies, who rule Kirks, Kingdoms, or Families, cannot pray: And if they pray, they ſcorne God in praying: they are nothing but hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrits, with fained voyces. What mooued Chriſt to pray for his Diſciples? A ſolicitude he had night &amp; day of their weale. No, ere any of them had died thorow his default, he had rather died him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. This made <hi>Dauid</hi> to watch ſo carefully ouer the people. And <hi>Paul, 2. Cor. chap. 12.</hi> when he hath recounted th'afflictions he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>All is but outwarde,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>but there is one inward, which preſſeth me like an army</hi>: and that was, a ſolicitude &amp; carefulnes he had for the Kirke of God, planted in his time: <hi>Who is afflicted,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>but J am afflicted</hi>? that is, No man is afflicted, but I am alſo afflicted: <hi>Who is offended, but I am alſo burnt?</hi> The offence of the Kirke, is a ſkauding and burning to mee. Of this care proceedeth prayer for the Kirke of God. But as for vs in this Land, we are like to loſe the Kirke: The King hath no care: the Nobilitie are gone backe, and haue no care: the people and the whole eſtate are careleſſe. If this way we lie ſtil in ſecurity, &amp; be careleſſe of the weale of the Kirke, what can we looke for at length, but that the Kirke ſhall be wrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and come to confuſion? But to what end is it that he would haue the Father to keep them? Look the words: he ſaith, <hi>That my ioy may be full in them.</hi> Before he ſpake of another end, to wit, <hi>That they
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:16631:120"/>
might bee one, as the Father and the Sonne are one.</hi> Then, whomſoeuer the Father taketh into his cuſtody, he keepeth them to the end, that both they may haue peace with others, &amp; alſo in their own ſoules and conſciences: for this peace of conſcience is that joye whereof now he ſpeaketh. But wherfore is it that he calleth this their joy his joy? In what reſpect is it called the joy of Ieſus? Becauſe this joy and peace of conſcience that paſſeth all vnderſtanding, could neuer come into the ſoules of the Apoſtles, or of any of GODS children ſince then; but thorow the ſprinkling of the blood of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, the Mediator betwixt God and man. So there is no ſolide joy nor peace of conſcience, vntill the time that the conſcience be firſt ſprinkled with the blood of Ieſus: and then the conſcience being once thus ſprinkled, the ſoule will find ſuch joy as no tongue can expreſſe. Thus much for the eight argument.</p>
            <p>The ninth argument is from that hatred wherewith the world perſued his Diſciples, &amp; hated them, <hi>The world hateth them,</hi> therfore, Father, keep thou them: they chaſe them here and there: now, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, be thou their refuge. Alace! it is a great miſery to be chaſed &amp; hunted here &amp; there, &amp; to be perſued in the world, &amp; in the mean time to get no reſt in God: when thou getteſt no reſt with God, &amp; no reſt in the world, miſerable is thy eſtate: but when thou getteſt reſt in the boſom of God, thou haſt joy &amp; quietnes in thy hart: this is it he reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth to the Father, <hi>Father, the world hateth them, therfore let them get reſt in thee</hi>: becauſe they are not of the world, it hateth them: the world loueth none, but godles ill men: now I haue giuen thy word to them, &amp; it is thy word that hath ſanctified them, &amp; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the world: for it is this word that will take thee out of the world: if the word of Chriſt ſeparate thee not from the pollution of the world, thou ſhalt periſh in the pollutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; ſtink of the world. Then he compareth them with himſelfe, <hi>They are like vnto me,</hi> &amp; thou ſhouldſt loue them the better: for the world loues them the worſe, that they loue me: the word of Ieſus, as it makes vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the world, ſo it makes vs like Ieſus Chriſt: if the word of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus make thee not holy, nothing ſhal mak thee holy, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nothing ſhall euer mak thee like Ieſus Chriſt: but this holy word of Chriſt, as it makes vs vnlike the world, ſo it makes vs like our head. Now he meanes, that this likenes with him was the ground of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: the world perſecuted them becaus they were like him, whom the world loued not: for, Brethren, this is the ground of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, to wit, the hatred of God, the hatred of the Light, and the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:16631:121"/>
hatred of that Majeſtie of ſelfe. Well then, yee ſee the hatred, and the perſecution of this worlde, is wrong vnderſtood: men thinke that when any man is perſecuted, or hated of the world, that God hateth them alſo: this is the judgement of the worlde: when they ſee any man troubled for the cauſe of Ieſus Chriſt, they will ſaye, God hateth this man. Nowe this is ſo falſe a judgement, that by the contrary, the hatred of this world is the ſureſt token that can be, that God loueth thee: If there were no more to tell thee, but the ſence and experience that godly men haue of Gods preſence, in the middeſt of the hatred of this worlde, it will tell thee, that God loueth them. A man who is perſecuted for Ieſus Chriſt, will feele ſuch a preſence in his heart of God, that the tongue of man nor Angel cannot tell: And when he is chaſed, till he pant, and bee breathleſſe, hee will feele ſuch a preſence, that hee will count no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of all the trouble of the world: as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth, <hi>Rom. 8. verſ. 31. Jf God bee with vs, who can bee againſt vs?</hi> And againe, <hi>Who can ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate vs from the loue of God in Ieſus Christ?</hi> Hee who feeleth this, hee will ſtand vp, and ſpit in the face of all the Tyrantes in the world: he will defie the world: the man who is fartheſt out of the worlde, Ieſus Chriſt is neareſt him: Goe out of the worlde, goe out of <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> bearing the reproach of Ieſus: and ſo thou ſhalt haue a ſenſe of that joye: the more thou conformeſt thee to the worlde, the nearer man or woman is joyned with this curſed generation, (the moſte curſed generation that euer was on the face of the earth,) thou ſhalt finde that thy God ſhall bee the farther from thee: when thou liueſt as they liue, and ſpeakeſt as they ſpeake, I appeale thy conſcience, if thou findeſt then the comfort and joye which thou foundeſt, being from that ſocietie? And if thou ſayeſt, thou haſt it, thou lieſt. If it were no more, but that ſenſe, it may tell thee, that this doctrine is true. Nowe I ſhall ende the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</p>
            <p>When he hath vſed this argument, he ſubjoyneth, <hi>I pray not that thou ſhouldest take them out of the worlde: but that thou ſhouldeſt keepe them</hi> from the euill of the worlde: for I haue a worke to doe with them: that is, to ſende them out to this curſed generation: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Father, keepe them: this is the thing that I praye, when I ſhall ſend them out to the world, that thou leaue them not, but in the middeſt of perſecution keepe them, till my worke bee ended. He craueth not, that they ſhould be free of perſecution: for of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye heard, he ſayth, In the world yee ſhall haue oppreſsion, but
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:16631:121"/>
bee of good comfort, in me ye ſhall haue peace: therefore hee cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not that they ſhould bee free of all perſecution: but that in the middeſt of perſecution, the Father ſhould bee with them, and make them victorious: &amp; more than victorious, euen to triumph. Yee may marke in theſe words, two remedies againſt the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the worlde: The godly haue two remedies againſt the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of the world: the firſt is When the Lord taketh his owne out of this miſerable world, to dwell with himſelfe in joy and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity. The other remedy againſt perſecution, is, when the Lord letteth his owne ſtill fight on in a battell, and in the meane time keepeth them wonderfully in the middeſt of perſecution: ſo that the world will be compelled, to wonder, that a man, or a woman, who feeleth the Lordes preſence, will ſo triumph in affliction. All this worlde hath no power to take their life, ſo long as the Lord hath his worke in their hands. All the Tyrants vnder the Heauen haue no power to harme them: and namely, a Preacher, till he end his worke for the which the Lord ſet him in the world, all the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants in the Earth cannot take his life from him: no, they cannot touch the leaſt hair of his head, for they are numbred: yea, rather ere he get any harme, the Lord will ſend his Angel out of Heauen, as he ſent him to <hi>Peter,</hi> and pull him out of the throat of death.</p>
            <p>Now, Brethren, looke to the order which the Lord vſeth in theſe remedies: he will not incontinent take his owne out of the world, howbeit the world be vnworthy of them: this world is not worthy of a good man: he will let them tarry till his work be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: There is not one of vs, when the Lord hath put a piece of work into our hands, in our own calling, that he will take out of this world, till we end it, to the glory of his holy Name. As I told you of before, it is a wonderfull thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how the Lord will keep his own: and he will not at an inſtant take them out of this world. Howbeit a man will mourne, and groane, vnder the burthen, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, when he ſayth, <hi>J chooſe rather to flitte out of this bodie, and to goe dwell with the Lord</hi>: yet the Lord will haue him abyding a while. Yea, howbeit a man will haue an heauy heart in this his Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, yet the Lord will haue him to remaine a while here: and in the meane time he will aboundantly comfort him, and will hold vp his head, as he did to <hi>Paul,</hi> when he deliuered him out of the Lyons mouth: that is, from the bloody Tyrant <hi>Nero: J am aſſured,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>and I haue a confidence, that the Lord ſhall deliuer mee, and keepe
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:16631:122"/>
me to his heauenly Kingdome.</hi> There is the remedy: he wil let thee bide ſtill in the world, yet an haire of thine head ſhall not fall without his will, but he will keepe thee to that heauenly Kingdome: and when he hath ended his worke with thee, he ſhall make thee to reſt in peace, and ſhall bring thee to himſelfe in his Kingdome. Let no man thinke, that ſo long as the Lord hath any worke adoe with any of his owne, that he will let them be taken out of the world. It is a vaine ſpeaking, when any man is taken out of the Common-wealth, or taken away by death, If this man had bene liuing, this had not bene done, and this euill had not come to paſſe. Vnderſtand this, when the Lord taketh him, the Lord hath done his worke with him: the Lord knoweth there is no more adoe with him, and therefore he taketh him. The enemies of the trueth thinke that they get a great victory, when a good man is taken out of the world. O Fooles! is not this the laſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance of the godly, who glorified God in their mortall bodies? For he ſhall glorifie them in deſpite of the world: they ſhall triumph ouer the world: No, the ſword, the fire, &amp;c. cannot hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this their triumph: Let wicked men come on their way, let them eſſay and proue on their way, they ſhall find in end, that the godly ſhall triumph, and in that Great day, they ſhall ſee them glorified: and then they ſhall ſay, Thought we not once that theſe men were vtterly wracked, whom now we ſee ſo glorious? So not only ſhame and confuſion ſhall light on them for their wickednes, but alſo this ſhall wonderfully aggreadge their condemnation, when they ſhall ſee them glorified, whom they perſecuted in the world.</p>
            <p>Let vs reſt in this hope, and let vs labour in this world, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit with hatred and with contempt, and we ſhall get the laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy: the Lord ſhall take vs to himſelfe, and we ſhall ceaſe from all labour, and ſhall be glorified with him in the Heauens, thorow Ieſus Chriſt: To whom, with the Father, and the holy Spirit, be all honour, praiſe, and glory, for euermore.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE LORD vſed ſundry arguments (welbeloued in the Lord Ieſus) to mooue his Father to keepe and preſerue his Diſciples, and Apoſtles, whom he was to leaue in the world behind him. Hitherto we haue nine of them, which we recounted the laſt day. Now in the beginning of this Text we haue the tenth and laſt argument, which he vſeth in his petition which he maketh, That the Father would keepe and preſerue his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. Shortly to come to the words: <hi>They are not of the worlde.</hi> Then would he conclude: <hi>Therefore, Father, keepe them.</hi> What is this, Not to be of the world? Not to be of the world, is, To be borne againe: to be regenerate and ſeparate from the pollution and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe of this world. By what meanes this is done vnto vs, we heard the laſt day: to wit, by the word of God: <hi>For,</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> ſayth, <hi>the word of God is that immortall ſeed of the eternall God, who liueth euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtingly, wherewith he begets vs of new again, &amp; ſeparates vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the world, from
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:16631:123"/>
the ignominie, filthineſſe, and wickedneſſe, wherein the worlde lieth natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, for the worlde is drowned in filthineſſe and wickedneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then he recommendeth to the Father the eſtate of them who were ſeparated from the world, by a compariſon with himſelfe, <hi>As I am not of the worlde,</hi> ſo are they not of the world. Looke this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the ſeuenth <hi>Chapter to the Hebrewes, verſ. 26. Our high Prieſt is vndefiled</hi>: that is, The Lord Ieſus is vndefiled, ſeparated from ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and made higher than the Heauen. Indeed it is true, it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for vs, ſo long as we liue in this mortall body, to be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſeparated from ſinne, and vncleanneſſe: but he was out of meaſure holy, and equall with the Father in glory. Yet we are in ſome meaſure like vnto him. Alwayes ye ſee in this, that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendeth our eſtate, that we are like the Sonne of God: and this commendeth our ſeparation from the world, in that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that in this ſeparation from the world, and the pollution thereof, we are like the Sonne of God.</p>
            <p>Brethren, whatſoeuer our eſtate be, ſo that in it we reſemble him, howbeit for his ſake it be ſhamefull and ignominious in the ſight of the world, it is glorious: if we be like to him in ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, we ſhall be like to him in glory: Our ſhame is neuer ſo great in the ſight of the world, if it be for his ſake, but it is better than all the honour and glory in the world. But<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to leaue this: The thing which I vnderſtand, is this ſhortly: The farther that we be from the world, the Lord hath the greater care ouer vs, and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth vs the better: And the nearer that we are to it, the leſſe is the care of our God ouer vs, and we are the worſe kept. What is the keeping of God elſe, but the drawing of vs out of this world, and the ſeuering of vs from the company of it? And when he hath drawne vs out of the world, the keeping of vs out of it againe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat we meddle not with it, and that we may be quite of it, and deliuered from it? This is not my meaning, that any man ſhould draw himſelfe to liue as an <hi>Heremite,</hi> and in the Wilderneſſe, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the ſociety of men, as the <hi>Monkes</hi> doe. This is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the craft of the Deuill, that men ſhould draw to Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, liuing in Harlotry, and in a Den of wickedneſſe; liuing in a vaine ſpeculation, feeding their bellies, and doing no good to the world. But this is it that I meane, That men euen liuing in the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of this worlde, yet they ſhould not liue as the worlde doeth; they ſhould ſeparate their life from the ſociety of the world. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Philippians, Chap. 2. verſ. 16.</hi> deſireth them to liue like as
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:16631:123"/>
many Lights. Where? Not in a backſide, but in the middeſt of this naughty and wicked generation, bearing before them the word of life. Thus ſhould we liue, as he ſayth, <hi>Philipp. Chap. 3. verſ. 20.</hi> that while we be liuing, we be Citizens in Heauen: and howbeit our bodies be here, that yet in the meane time our conuerſation be in the Heauen, and that we liue an Heauenly life, as if we were not liuing in the Earth, but in the Heauen, with the Angels, and with our Mediatour.</p>
            <p>Now to goe forward ſhortly: Hauing vſed this argument from their ſeparation from the world, in the next <hi>Verſ.</hi> he inſiſteth in it, and of it he taketh the occaſion of a new petition. He hath prayed the Father to keepe his Diſciples: now he prayeth the Father to ſanctifie them: that is, that as once the Father had begun to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them from the world, ſo he would continually ſeparate them from the worlde, till hee tooke them out of the worlde. It is not enough to begin to bee ſanctified: that is, to bee ſeparated out of the world: it is not enough once to begin to be holy, but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, night and day, wee muſt warble out of the pollution and filthineſſe of this world, and grow in holineſſe of life and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. But wherewith ſhall they bee ſanctified? <hi>With the trueth</hi>: It is the trueth of God, in Ieſus Chriſt, that maketh man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man holie. Not euerie trueth maketh man or woman holie, but the trueth of God, in Ieſus Chriſt, who is the Way, the Trueth, and the Life. This trueth is the worde of God, which ſeparateth thee from the world.</p>
            <p>Well then, it is the word that ſanctifieth, and maketh men and women holie: for as the worde is the immortall ſeede, whereby wee are borne againe, ſo it is that ſweete and ſincere Milke, (as <hi>Peter</hi> ſayeth,) whereby wee growe in him. It is the worde that begetteth vs in him, and maketh vs to growe on, till wee ſee our Sauiour. Wouldeſt thou begin to bee holy? heare the word: thou ſhalt neuer bee ſanctified, till thou heare the word. Wouldeſt thou grow on here ſtill? that is the onlie meane that God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this worlde. Heare aye, and grow on, and at laſt thy glorie ſhall be perfected in Ieſus Chriſt. Brethren, to mark ſomwhat here: He prayeth, that <hi>they may bee ſanctified</hi>: that is, that more and more they may bee ſeuered from the world. Then we muſt aye grow on in holineſſe: as ye reade in the <hi>Reuelation</hi> of <hi>Iohn, Chap. 22. verſ. 11. Hee who is just, let him bee just ſtill: and hee who is holie, let him bee holie ſtill,</hi> &amp;c. Well, it is a good thing to beginne to bee holie: for
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:16631:124"/>
he who beginneth truely to be holy, he groweth on ſtill.</p>
            <p>Now the meane whereby we grow in holineſſe, is Prayer: Ye ſee here, the Lord he prayeth, that his Diſciples, who were begun to be holy, ſhould grow on in holineſſe, and ſhould be ſeparated from the world. So the ſpeciall meane is Prayer: <hi>Pray continuallie.</hi> It is our ſluggiſhneſſe in prayer, that cauſeth vs to want an holy hart, and growth of that ſanctification. Wouldeſt thou be aye holy? <hi>Pray euer.</hi> If thou prayeſt not, but loatheſt prayer, thine holineſſe ſhall faile. Wouldeſt thou grow in holineſſe? Continue in prayer. Now the inſtrument that maketh thee holy, and that God hath ordained to take away the filth of thy nature, and that the holy Spirit taketh in his hand, as it were, to waſh away the pollution of thy nature, is the word of Trueth. As he vſeth the meane of Prayer, ſo he vſeth the word of Trueth. When the word of God is preached, lay to thine eare to heare: and pray ſtill, and heare on ſtill. How ſhalt thou heare? In hearing pray: that is, when thou heareſt the word of Trueth, pray him, that by the word of trueth he would ſanctifie thee: that is, that by his holy Spirit that word may be effectuall in thy ſoule: Say this wayes, Now, Lord, as this is the only inſtrument, appointed to ſanctifie may ſoule, and ſcoure away the corruption of my dead nature: ſo let thine holy Spirit take it in his hand, and conuoy it into my ſoule, to ſanctifie my ſoule. Pray ay, and heare euer, and craue that the word may take effect to make thee holy.</p>
            <p>When he hath made his petition to his Father, to ſanctifie and to ſeparate his Diſciples from the world, and from the pollution of the world, to this purpoſe he vſeth one or two arguments in the words following: The firſt is in theſe words, <hi>As thou haſt ſent mee into the worlde, ſo haue I ſent them.</hi> Father, I haue ſent them into the world, therefore, Father, ſanctifie them. He declareth this by a compariſon from himſelfe, <hi>As thou haſt ſent mee, ſo haue I ſent them.</hi> Ye heard he made them like to himſelfe in holineſſe, ſo now he maketh them like to himſelfe in vocation. It is a bleſſed thing, to be like to Chriſt in many things. And ſo by this likeneſſe with himſelfe, he recommendeth them to the Father. The Diſciples of Chriſt, whom ye call the Apoſtles, they were like Chriſt in calling and vocation. The Lord Ieſus was the great Apoſtle of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion. <hi>Hebr. 13. verſ. 11.</hi> and they were alſo ſent by the will of the Father: So they were, in a manner, like vnto him, in calling and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: but here is the difference, The Lord Ieſus was an Apoſtle
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:16631:124"/>
immediately ſent by the Father: the Father ſent him to the world immediately: but the Apoſtles were not ſent immediately by the Father, but they were ſent immediately by the Sonne. The Lord Ieſus, as he was ſent of the Father immediately, ſo he ſent his Apoſtles immediately, yet at the will of the Father. Looke the Epiſtles of <hi>Paul</hi>: he calleth himſelfe the Apoſtle, that is, the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour of Ieſus Chriſt. But how? By the will of the Father. So it fareth with the Paſtors and Teachers in the Kirke of God: No commiſsion they haue from Ieſus Chriſt, but at the will of the Father As this is true, that the Paſtor, or Teacher in the Kirke, is immediately ſent by the Sonne; So it is true, in al grace that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from Heauen to the Kirke, all commeth immediately from the Sonne, and not from the Father. Whatſoeuer grace it be, as vocation, juſtification, ſanctification, and life euerlaſting, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer gift it be, all commeth immediately from the Sonne: as in the fourth <hi>Chap.</hi> to the <hi>Epheſ. verſ. 10.11.</hi> where he citeth the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Dauid, Hee paſſed vp on high,</hi> (meaning of Chriſt,) that is, to the Heauens, <hi>hee ledde captiuitie captiue, and hee gaue giftes to men</hi>: that is, the Lord Ieſus, who was humbled, being exalted to glory, ſendeth downe grace on his Kirke: he gaue ſome to be his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, ſome to be Euangeliſts, ſome to be Paſtors, and ſome to be Doctors. The ground of all is this, The Father hath giuen all power in Heauen, and in Earth, to the Sonne. Thou ſhouldeſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this well. What is the Sonne of God? He is the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure-houſe of all the grace and mercy of the Father. Whoſoeuer would haue grace and mercy from the Father, let him addreſſe himſelfe vnto him; for in him is the fulneſſe of all grace, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing knowledge, and wiſedome: in him is the deepneſſe and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Godhead bodily, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth to the <hi>Coloſſ. Chap. 2. verſ. 9.</hi> and all grace immediately is powred out from him on the Kirke. Let him that would haue any grace, addreſſe himſelfe to the Sonne, and deſire him, that the Father would giue ſome portion of grace, out of that Treaſure-houſe, Ieſus Chriſt. If thou paſſeſt by him, thou ſhalt neuer taſte of grace. Seeke grace, where there is fulneſſe of all grace in the world.</p>
            <p>The thing which I marke of this argument, is this ſhortly: To mooue his Father to ſanctifie his Diſciples, he vſeth this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Father, I ſend them out to the world. Now ye ſee the Leſſon that riſeth, Whoſoeuer commeth to the world, to draw this world out of that pollution and filthineſſe wherein it lieth, to ſanctifie
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:16631:125"/>
the world, and to make this world holy, of an vncleane world, to make it cleane, of neceſsity hee muſt bee ſanctified. Alace! Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, an vnfaithfull, and vnholy man, let him bee a Miniſter, (as for Apoſtles we haue none,) not ſeparated from the world, but in all things like the world, is vnmeet to preach, and to be an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Miniſter of God, to ſanctifie the wicked worlde, or to win ſoules to Heauen. An vnholy man, and in no meaſure ſeparated from the world, but in life and conuerſation like the worlde, in all vanity, let him not open his mouth to ſpeake of Chriſt. There is not one that the Lord Ieſus ſendeth, but in ſome meaſure hee will make them holy: and therefore, that man that liueth like this worlde, and hath his conuerſation in all pointes like the worlde, I ſay, and I aſſure thee, the Lord neuer ſent that man. So, if a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter would haue a good conſcience in his calling, and would goe out to the worlde, to draw men to Heauen, let him try himſelfe, if he be ſeparated from the world, or no: And if hee finde that hee is ſeparated from the world, then with the better conſcience hee may ſpeake of Ieſus Chriſt: and then hee may put out his hand to miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable men, and draw them piece and piece out of this ſinful world: otherwayes he can haue no boldneſſe.</p>
            <p>Nowe let vs come to the ſeconde argument: The ſeconde argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which hee vſeth, is from the ende of his ſanctification: For their ſakes <hi>I haue ſanctifie my ſelfe.</hi> To what end? <hi>That they may be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified through thy trueth.</hi> I haue ſanctified my ſelf, that is, I haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated my ſelfe to the death, to bee a Sacrifice, that by my death, and thorow it, they ſhould be made holy, and that by the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Croſſe. The ground of all our ſanctification, is the Croſſe and death of Ieſus Chriſt. It is that blood, and that Sacrifice, that maketh vs holy, and which is that meritorious cauſe that hath procured holineſſe to euerie one of vs. Well, Brethren, as little as men will count of holineſſe, our holineſſe is deare bought: there is not one that hath a ſponke of holineſſe, little or much, but it is bought by the precious blood of the immaculate Lambe: it is the deareſt Merchandize that euer was bought in the worlde. So the ground of holineſſe, is the blood of God: But I ſay againe, except that the Croſſe of Chriſt, and his blood, and his death and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, be made thine, and applied to thee, and apprehended to thee, and except (ſo to ſpeake it) the Croſſe of Ieſus Chriſt bee in thine heart, and thy conſcience ſprinkled with his blood, the Croſſe of Ieſus ſhall neuer doe thee good, to make thee holy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:16631:125"/>Now, yee ſee the meane, and inſtrument, whereby the death of Chriſt is made ours: It is the worde of Chriſt, euen the worde of the Croſſe: This ſame Goſpel of Ieſus Chriſt, wherein the Lord, in a manner, is crucified, and painted out to thine eye, that is the meane, which applyeth to thy ſoule that death, that it may bee ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall in thee, to ſanctification and holineſſe of life: It will not bee Chriſt, and his Croſſe, without thee, that will ſanctifie thee, except thou belieue in him, and by fayth drawe Chriſt, and his blood, into thine heart, thou mayeſt well bee worſe, and the Croſſe of Chriſt may condemne thee, but thou ſhalt neuer bee the better of him: But if thou belieueſt this worde of the Croſſe, and ſo make Ieſus Chriſt, and his Croſſe, thine by fayth, then the blood of Ieſus Chriſt ſhall guſhe out, to thy ſanctification: It cannot bee ydle, but it muſt ſanctifie, and ſeparate thee from the worlde, and make thee an Heire of Life.</p>
            <p>Looke howe yee ſhould haue a ſight of the Croſſe of Chriſt: thinke it not enough, that Chriſt ſuffered and died for ſinners, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept when thou heareſt this worde of the Croſſe, thine heart griedilie gripe, and drawe Chriſt in to thy ſelfe: and this aye ſhould bee our exerciſe in the hearing of the word of the Croſſe of Ieſus Chriſt, to get ſuch a ſolide apprehenſion of the Croſſe, that thou mayeſt ſay, The Lord Ieſus died for me, the greateſt ſinner in the world. Look that thou find the effect and fruit to flow of that Croſſe, to the ſanctification of thy ſoule, &amp; mortification &amp; ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of thy ſinfull nature, day &amp; night. So heare not with the eares only, but with the apprehenſion of the heart, or els that Croſſe ſhal neuer be effectual to ſaue thee, but for all this benefit of the word of the Croſſe of Ieſus Chriſt, euerlaſting death and damnation ſhall be thine ende. Bee not ſecure in hearing, but drawe in to thy ſelfe Ieſus Chriſt, and there ſhall followe ſuch a joye and conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that all the tongues of men nor Angels, cannot expreſſe: there is no pleaſure comparable to that pleaſure, which the heart of a faythfull man will finde.</p>
            <p>Now hitherto hee hath prayed for himſelfe firſt, That the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would glorifie him: and next, for his Diſciples, eleuen in number, for <hi>Iudas</hi> hath no part of that Prayer. Now laſt, he exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his Prayer farder out, beyonde all the Apoſtles, to the whole faythfull, that ſhall belieue in him, to the ende of the worlde. And this is the third part of this Prayer: a Prayer for the whole fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that ſhould belieue in him, to the ende of the worlde. But
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:16631:126"/>
to come to the wordes: <hi>Not for them onelie,</hi> that is, Not for my Diſciples alone, doe I pray, <hi>But J praye alſo for all them that ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue in me through their Worde.</hi> And vvhat prayeth hee for them? That they may bee made vp in one bodie, joyned with that band of perfection, of charitie and loue. And howe? <hi>As thou and I am one: Thou art in mee, and I am in thee, ſo they may bee one in vs</hi>: that is, Through their fayth in vs: and that, to this ende, that the worlde may belieue in mee, that thou haſt ſent mee. Yee ſee howe this Prayer of Chriſt extendeth it ſelfe: it beginneth nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowlie, and then piece and piece it groweth. It beginneth firſt at himſelfe onelie, and hee prayeth, That the Father would glorifie him. And then farther hee maketh his petition for his Diſciples, That hee would firſt keepe them, and then ſanctifie them. Then he extendeth it farther out, to the whole belieuers, that ſhall belieue in him to the ende of the worlde. So, Brethren, it is not contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned within that Age in the which Chriſt was in the Earth, (this is a great conſolation,) it pertaineth not onelie to thoſe <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> that were at that time: but the Prayer of Ieſus Chriſt, euen this ſame Prayer, wherewith hee did conſecrate himſelfe to the death of the Croſſe, it reacheth out to vs in this Age: And looke howe manie of vs hath fayth in Ieſus Chriſt, wee may bee aſſured that that Prayer which Chriſt made, was made for vs, and euerie one that belieueth. And when wee reade this Prayer, and theſe wordes, <hi>I pray not for them onelie, but for them that ſhall belieue,</hi> there is not one, who findeth a ſponke of fayth, but hee may ſaye, Chriſt made this Prayer for mee, as aſſuredly as hee prayed for <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iames,</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles: For when the Lord prayed, his eye was vpon euerie ſoule that ſhould belieue in him to the ende of the worlde: hee recommended euerie ſoule to his Father in this Prayer. Not generallie: but the Lord Ieſus being God and man, hee had euerie ſoule before his eye, that euer was choſen, and called, or ſhall bee called to the ende of the worlde: and he prayed particularlie for euerie ſoule. So, if thou findeſt fayth in thine heart, thou mayeſt ſay, The Lord made interceſsion for me, as well as hee did for <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> or the reſt. But, Brethren, this is well to bee marked, for whom it is that hee prayed: not for euerie man and woman, but for them who haue fayth, for thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue in him: Neuer ſoule got part of that Prayer, or of his death, or of his bleſſed reſurrection, or of that glorie, that belieueth not. Therefore, let vs belieue, as euer wee would haue anie grace: for
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:16631:126"/>
no grace ſhall euer appertaine to any ſoule, but to that ſoule that belieueth. It is not for ſcant of grace, that the worlde periſheth: The Prayer of Ieſus Chriſt might extende it ſelfe to a thouſande worldes. Howe falleth it out then, if hee might ſaue a thouſande worldes, that the worlde periſheth? It is not for ſcant of vertue, in the Prayer, or in the death of Chriſt, that the worlde periſhed; but for want of fayth: wee are not capable of the vertue of his death: no ſoule is capable of that death, but that ſoule that is faythfull: that man that is faythfull, is made partaker of all the Prayers of Ieſus Chriſt, and the vertue of that death ſhall ſtrike out to his ſaluation. Onelie belieue, and thou ſhalt finde the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of that Prayer: but if thou belieueſt not, that Prayer ſhall not ſerue to thy ſaluation.</p>
            <p>But this is to be marked: How is this fayth gotten? <hi>Thoſe,</hi> ſayth hee, <hi>who ſhall belieue in mee, through their worde.</hi> Fayth in Ieſus Chriſt is *****not gotten by euerie worde, and euerie dreame, and euerie vnwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten verity, and fantaſie of man. (The enemies haue filled the world with dreames, and giue out fantaſies and dreames to bee belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.) The inuentions of the Pope and Cardinalls, will not breede fayth in thine heart. Looke the wordes, <hi>They who belieue in mee through their worde.</hi> No worde will breede fayth, but the worde of the Apoſtles: Chriſt will ſo honour them, that hee will neuer worke fayth in the heart of man, but by their worde onelie: And ſo to the ende of the worlde, no worde is to bee belieued, but the worde of the Apoſtles and Prophets: For this excludeth not the worde of the Prophets, but the traditions of me. If thou ſetteſt thine heart to ſeeke fayth by the worde of the <hi>Antichrist,</hi> thou ſhalt neuer gette fayth in thine heart. If thou wilt haue fayth, heare this worde of the Apoſtles: and if thou turneſt thine eare from it, all the wordes in the worlde ſhall not worke fayth in thine heart. The thing which hee requireth would bee marked: What requireth hee? Hee requireth, <hi>That they all may bee one.</hi> So, the thing which hee asketh for vs all, to the ende of the worlde, it is, That wee bee joyned together in that conjunction of loue, and made vp in one bodie, and one newe man, whereof the Head is the LORD IESVS, and knitte vp with that band of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which is loue. Without IESVS CHRIST there is no bodie, there is no coniunction with the members: no, the ſibbeſt conjunction in the worlde, is not worth a pennie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out IESVS CHRIST: No, the conjunction of man and
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:16631:127"/>
woman, which is a neare conjunction, and the conjunction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt brother and ſiſter: and in a word, all conjunction, is nothing but a diſperſion, which is without Ieſus Chriſt; it is nothing but a variance. This naturall life is nothing without Ieſus Chriſt. I might drawe this matter from the grounde: After <hi>Adam</hi> had fallen, and was ſeuered from God, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> had no true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, nor none of their poſterie after them. Then, Brethren, howe get wee our conjunction againe? Euen by Ieſus Chriſt, and by that vertue in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for except in him, nature, and all theſe bandes bee ſanctified, by them men cannot bee joyned together amongſt themſelues: For in him there is made a gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of all thinges, both which are in Heauen, and which are in Earth, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 20.</p>
            <p>He inſiſteth vpon that vnion, and he recommendeth it vnto vs, and amplifieth it from<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſimilitude between the Father and the Sonne: The Father is in the Sonne, and the Sonne is in the Father: that is, they are one, by a wonderful and vnſpeakable conjunction, in a diuine nature and eſſence. The thing in the world, wherein we reſemble moſte that glorious Trinitie, the Father, the Sonne, and the holie Spirit, is this vnion: Wouldeſt thou bee like the Father, and like the Sonne, and like the holie Ghoſt, then bee vnited in heart and loue, with the members of Ieſus Chriſt. There is no likeneſſe with the Father, without this vnion. A man full of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice in the heart, is no more like to Ieſus Chriſt, and to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than the Deuill is: and that is the thing which the Deuill ſeeketh moſte of all, to make men vnlike to God: For as vnion with God bringeth life euerlaſting, ſo vnlikeneſſe with God, and diſſeuering from him, bringeth death euerlaſting. None ſhall bee ſafe in that Great daye, but ſo manie as are vnited with a bande of loue: if thou bee not vnited by that bande, with the members, looke for nothing but death.</p>
            <p>Then hee ſetteth downe the ground of our conjunction, <hi>Euen that they may bee alſo one in vs.</hi> What is the ground of the coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the members amongſt themſelues, but the coniunction of the members in the Head? If thou bee not joyned with the Head, the Lord Ieſus, by fayth, thou canſt not dwell with thy neighbour in loue and charitie. Hee who is joyned with the Kirke, hee muſt firſt bee ioyned with Chriſt. Hee commeth to the argumentes of this coniunction, and the firſt is, from the ende, which is this, <hi>That the worlde may knowe, that I am ſent from thee</hi>: that is, that the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:16631:127"/>
world ſeeing that vnion of the faythfull amongſt themſelues, and that binding vp of their mindes and hearts, by that band of loue, may know me, from whom that conjunction proceedeth, and they may take me vp, not (as they doe) to be a wicked man, but to haue come downe from the Father, and to be the Sonne of God. Then, Brethren, there is not a thing in the world, no, not an effect in the world, where in that vertue of Ieſus Chriſt appeareth more, than in this conjunction of the members of the Kirke in the Earth. So, wouldeſt thou ſhowe before the worlde, that Ieſus is God, equall with the Father? bee at one with thy neighbour. Wouldeſt thou glorifie Ieſus Chriſt, and profeſſe him before the worlde, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him? liue in peace, vnitie, and concord. Wouldeſt thou diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour him, and ſhame him before the world? be at variance, haue no peace, and no loue. If thou wouldeſt ſet thy ſelfe to make the worlde thinke, that Ieſus Chriſt is not one with the Father, haue no peace with thy neighbour. This conjunction, and making vp of one body, is no ſmall effect of the vertue of Ieſus Chriſt: there is no power in Heauen nor in Earth, but this power of God, that will make vp that band: all the Kinges in the Earth will not make thee loue thy neighbour truely: no power can make thee loue thy Wife truely: no, not thy Children, but onely that power that flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth from Ieſus Chriſt, the infinite power of that Godhead, which floweth from him to thy ſoule, is able to turne thine hatred into loue, and to ſanctifie thee. So, wouldeſt thou glorifie Chriſt in this world, and liue in this world to the glory of him, and profeſſe that he is God, and that the fulneſſe of the Godhead dwelleth in him bodily? ſtriue, ſo farre as lieth in thee, to keepe peace with all men, and bee knitte vp in loue with thy neighbour, as thou wouldeſt glorifie him in this life, and haue part of that euerlaſting glorie, purchaſed by the blood of Chriſt: To whome, with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the holie Spirit, bee all prayſe, honour, and glorie, for euermore.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the laſt part of this PRAYER (Wel beloued in the Lord Ieſus) the Lord, after that hee hath prayed for himſelfe, that the Father would glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him; and after that hee had prayed for his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, to wit, the eleuen, (for hee prayeth not for <hi>Judas,</hi> becauſe hee was the ſonne of perdition,) at laſt he conceiueth a Prayer for the whole faithfull to the ende of the worlde: <hi>I pray not,</hi> ſayeth the Lord, <hi>for them onelie,</hi> that is, for my Diſciples, <hi>but</hi> I pray <hi>for all them that will belieue in mee, through their word.</hi> The thing which he prayeth for the whole faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, is this, That they may bee one in this worlde, joyned in one heart and minde, to make vp in this Earth that glorious bodie of Ieſus Chriſt: that is the thing hee prayeth for. The firſt argument yee hearde the laſt daye, which was from the ende of that vnion of men and women, in the Kirke of God, and of the making vp of the bodie of Ieſus Chriſt: Then the world ſhall know, that Chriſt is ſent of the Father: In that conjunction and vnion, they ſhall ſee
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:16631:128"/>
that Ieſus Chriſt is the Meſsias, ſent of the Father, to the worlde, for the redemption of the world: that is the firſt argument.</p>
            <p>Now wee goe forward in this preſent Text, to the ſecond argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his petition, for the whole faythfull to the ende of the world. The ſecond argument is taken from the end of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie which the Father hath giuen to the Sonne, and that the Sonne hath giuen to the faythfull: the ende of all this, is, That there ſhould be an vnion and conjunction amongſt the members of one bodie of Ieſus Chriſt in the Earth. The glory that the Father gaue to the Sonne, and the glorie that the Sonne gaue to vs, tendeth to this end, that we be joyned together in the Earth, to make vp the bodie of Ieſus Chriſt: Seeing that all the glorie that thou haſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen mee, and I haue giuen them, ſerueth to this, that they may bee one, as we are one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this is the thing I pray for, That they may bee vnited in one bodie. <hi>The glorie,</hi> ſayeth the Lord, <hi>that thou haſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen mee, I haue giuen it vnto them</hi>: That is, to the whole faythfull: not to his Diſciples onlie, but to the whole faythfull to the end of the worlde. What is the glorie that the Father hath giuen to the Sonne? The next word expoundeth it, and maketh it cleare: The glorie that the Father giueth to the Sonne, ſtandeth in this, that the Father is in the Sonne: <hi>I in them, and thou in mee.</hi> The Father is in the Sonne: the Father hath giuen himſelfe to the Sonne. This is high, but I ſhall make it plaine to you: In the eternall genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein the Father begot the Sonne from all eternity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beginning, the Father communicated with the Sonne that whole glorious ſubſtance and nature: and as ſoone as hee commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated with the Sonne his whole glorious nature and ſubſtance, ſo ſoone the Father and the Sonne became one in nature and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: And therefore, conſidering this communication of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and ſubſtance of the Father and the Sonne, it is ſaide, that the Father is in the Sonne, to wit, in nature and ſubſtance, and that the Father hath giuen to the Sonne his glorie: For, Brethren, what is the glorie of God? Nothing but the glorious eſſence and nature of God: and this is the glorie that he giueth to the Sonne. What is meant againe by this glorie that the Sonne giueth to the Father? The wordes in the next <hi>Verſ.</hi> maketh it plaine, <hi>I in them</hi>: The glorie that the Sonne hath giuen vs, is nothing but himſelfe: it ſtandeth in this, That the Sonne is in euerie one of the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. To make it more plaine: In our Regeneration and newe birth, the Sonne of God, Ieſus Chriſt, communicateth to euerie
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:16631:129"/>
one of the faythfull, borne anewe againe, his holie Spirit: and ſo, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh, 2. <hi>Epiſt. Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. he maketh vs partakers of that diuine-nature: There is not one of vs, that hath gotten that holie Spirit of Ieſus Chriſt, but, in a manner, wee are made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of that diuine nature: Yea, in our Regeneration, the Sonne of God giueth vnto vs himſelfe. This is a great prerogatiue to thy ſoule, to get God to dwell in thee: for where the holy Spirite is, there is fayth: for the Spirite breedeth fayth in the heart: and where fayth is, there is Ieſus Chriſt. Haſt thou fayth? thou haſt Chriſt. The ſaying of the Apoſtle PAVL to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> muſt bee true, <hi>Christ dwelleth in the heart by fayth.</hi> Haſt thou fayth in Ieſus Chriſt? thou haſt Ieſus Chriſt, the Sonne of God: and if thou haſt fayth, thou haſt the holie Spirite in thine heart: and if thou haue the Sonne, thou haſt the Father: and if thou haue the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thou haſt the glorious Trinitie in thee, the Father, the Sonne, and the holie Spirite. Well then, Brethren, conſider this giuing of Chriſt, wherein hee giueth himſelfe vnto vs: by this Regeneration the Lord is in euerie faythfull man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: that is the meaning. As the Father communicateth himſelfe to the Sonne, ſo the Sonne communicateth himſelfe to euerie one of vs: and, as it were, hee communicateth that diuine nature vnto vs in this life, and much more in the life euerlaſting.</p>
            <p>But to come to the ende of the glorie that the Father giueth to the Sonne, and that the Sonne giueth to the faythfull, that is, <hi>That they may bee one, as wee are one.</hi> The Father being in the Sonne, the Father and the Sonne becommeth one, in that glorious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and nature: and then the Sonne, the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, being in vs, there riſeth not onelie a conjunction of vs and him together, a conjunction of the bodie and the head, but there ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth alſo another, to wit, a conjunction with the reſt of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his bodie in the Earth: For, Brethren, where the Spirite of Ieſus is, where Fayth is, where Chriſt is in the heart of anie man or woman, there, of neede force, loue muſt bee: fayth and charitie are vnſeparable: Where that bande of perfection is, as the Apoſtle PAVL calleth it, in the third <hi>Chapter</hi> to the <hi>Coloſſians, Verſ.</hi> 14. Where fayth in Chriſt is in thine heart, thou muſt bee joyned with the Kirke of God, and with thy neighbour. And this is our perfection, that euerie one of vs is joyned with another in this bande of loue. There is no perfection of a member in this worlde, when it is ſundered from the reſt of the members: Cutte
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:16631:129"/>
off a member from the bodie, it doeth no good, but periſheth: Cut off the hand from the bodie, whereto ſerueth it? Or, cut off the foote, what perfection ſhall it haue? Take the eye out of the head, whereto ſerueth it? So the perfection of euerie one of vs, ſtandeth in the conjunction of vs together, in the bodie of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. Wouldeſt thou bee perfect? Bee thou an hande, or a foote, or ſome member, (yea, if it were but a little To<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>,) of the bodie of Ieſus Chriſt, that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the Kirke, or elſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> thou art but a rotten member. If hee were a King, if hee bee ſeparated from the Kirke of God, hee is but a ſtinking vilde member, and ſerueth for no vſe, and in ende ſhall bee caſten into the fire.</p>
            <p>The doctrine which wee ſee heere, Brethren, is, That vertue which commeth from Ieſus Chriſt: For all grace and life floweth from him, and commeth to vs, by vertue of that conjunction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and vs: the vertue is not to make a man perfect in himſelfe, and abſolute with all ſorte of graces: that is not the vertue of IESVS CHRIST, to make anie man ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutelie perfect, that hee ſhall not haue neede to begge anie thing at his neighbour: But this is the vertue that commeth from Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS CHRIST our Head, to make all, one man; and not to make one member, the whole bodie: but to make one, an eye in the bodie, and another an hande, and another a foote, &amp;c. And not to ſet vp anie one man, no, not the Emperour, nor the King, to make him the whole bodie.</p>
            <p>Then, Brethren, this grace of IESVS CHRIST, is to make a conjunction amongſt the members, and not to giue vnto him, or her, all grace: Yea, though it were the Emperour, or the King, the LORD will giue him but parte of grace: And hee will giue that grace to the ſobereſt Subject in the Lande, which hee will not giue vnto the King: And againe, hee will giue vnto the King, that which hee will not giue vnto the Subiect. For, hee will giue to one, to doe the office of a Foote, and to another to doe the office of an Eye, and to ſome other, to doe the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Hande, &amp;c. Nowe the Foote cannot bee the Hande, nor the Hande the Foote: So it is with the members of IESVS CHRIST: And wee ſee by experience, yee ſhall neuer ſee that one man hath gotten all graces: but hee who hath gotten one grace, hee wanteth another, and his neighbour hath gotten that which he wanteth. This the Lord doth, that there may be a conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the members, &amp; to make thee ioyne with thy neighbour,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:16631:130"/>
becauſe hee hath the grace that thou wanteſt: for if euerie man had all graces, euerie man would misknow another. The man that will ſtand vp in a prowde conceit of himſelfe, and will mount aboue the Kirke, and contemne anie member of that bodie, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit it were the ſillieſt member of Ieſus Chriſt, hee is nothing, and hee ſhall haue no portion of grace. If thou joyneſt not thy ſelfe with thy neighbours, and with the members of Ieſus Chriſt, thou haſt no grace.</p>
            <p>Yet he inſiſteth in the commendation of this conjunction: for it is a bleſſed conjunction, to bee joyned with the Kirke of Ieſus Chriſt in this world: of all bleſsinges it is the greateſt, if thou be a true member in the Kirke, if it were but the foote, thou haſt gotten a greater bleſsing than thou hadſt gotten all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the worlde. As therefore thou wouldeſt bee partaker of that life to come, looke that thou be a member of the bodie of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt: if thou bee not the eye, thinke it a great thing to bee the foote, or to bee a Toe of that glorious bodie. Hee commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it from two endes: the firſt is. <hi>The worlde ſhall knowe, that J am ſent from thee,</hi> as hee ſaide <hi>Verſ. 21.</hi> Wouldeſt thou know that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is the Meſsias? bee conjoyned in that bodie of Ieſus Chriſt. Another is, <hi>The worlde ſhall knowe, that thou haſt loued the faythfull, as thou haſt loued mee.</hi> Wouldeſt thou knowe, that God lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the faythfull, and that hee ſhoweth mercie? joyne thee to the bodie. There are the two endes of the conjunction and joyning together of the members: The firſt is, the glorie of the Sonne: the ſecond is, the glorie of the Father: for by this conjunction, it is knowne, howe dearelie the Father hath loued the Sonne: and by this, it is knowne, that the Father hath loued the world: not with a common loue: hee hath not loued the worlde onelie as a worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man loueth his worke-man-ſhip; but as the Father hath loued the Sonne: that is, with a Fatherlie loue: that is another ſort of loue than a common loue. What auaileth it to thee to knowe, that God loueth thee as his creature, if thou bee not aſſured that hee loueth thee with that entire loue, wherewith he loued his Sonne: and that hee loueth thee with that Fatherlie loue, and with the bowels of pittie? And if he loue thee as his Son, he ſheweth it in this, That hee gaue his Sonne for thee: for except the Father had loued thee as his Sonne, with that Fatherlie loue, hee had neuer ſent Ieſus Chriſt to redeeme thee. The ſending of Ieſus Chriſt teſtifieth, that hee loued thee with a Fatherlie loue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:16631:130"/>Wee ſee heere, wherefore God hath a Kirke in this worlde. Wherefore is there a communion and conjunction of ſoules heere in this Earth? Thinke not that a Kirke is gathered for none end. Wherefore is it then, that there is a Kirke? In a worde, It is, that the glorie of the Father ſhould ſhine, in that ſocietie and coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Sainctes in the Earth. Ieſus Chriſt is glorified in his Kirke, and the Father of Ieſus Chriſt is alſo glorified in it: They who diuide and diſſeuer the Kirke of Ieſus Chriſt in the Earth, they doe nothing elſe, but to deface the glorie of Ieſus Chriſt, and the glorie of the Father. Wilt thou ſlay and perſecute the Kirke of Chriſt? What doeſt thou? Nothing but defaceſt, and ſcorneſt the glorie of Ieſus Chriſt. What are theſe men doing, that perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Kirke that the Lord hath gathered in this Land? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſmoaring the glorie of the Father, and the Sonne: and the Lord ſhall turne their glorie to ſhame and confuſion: I giue them their doome, The Father of Heauen ſhall turne them, and all that ſhall conioyne with them, to ſhame and confuſion.</p>
            <p>Marke the order, howe the glorie of the Father, and of the Sonne, is knowne: Firſt, wee knowe, that the Sonne is ſent from the Father, for vs and our redemption. Next, by the ſending of the Sonne for vs, wee knowe tne vnſpeakeable loue of the Father towardes vs. Nowe I goe forwarde: When hee hath prayed for this coniunction and vnitie of the faythfull on the Earth, that they may bee ioyned in one bodie; hee is not content with this, but hee ſeeketh more: <hi>Father,</hi> ſayeth hee, <hi>where I am, I will that they bee there: that they may ſee that glorie that thou haſt giuen mee.</hi> The Lord ſeeketh not onelie glorie to the faythfull in this life, but glorie in the life to come. Hee intercedeth not onelie for thee, that thou mayeſt haue glorie in this life, but alſo that thou bee glorified in the Heauens after this life. For, Brethren, the Lord Ieſus conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered very well, that our felicitie is not bounded within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of this Earth. That is a miſerable happineſſe, that is boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded within this life: thou art but a catiue, if thou lockeſt for none other happineſſe: as PAVI<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſayeth, in the firſt <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians, Chap. 15. Verſ. 19. Jf our fayth bee onelie in this worlde, of all men in the worlde, wee are the moſt miſerable.</hi> So if thou haſt this grace onelie in this life, thou art miſerable: for all the graces that thou getteſt, if thy felicitie reach not beyonde this worlde, and beyond all eternitie, thou art miſerable. Felicitie hath none ende: the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe of the faythfull man, or woman, hath none ende: it is not
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:16631:131"/>
drawne within the compaſſe of this Earth, but it paſſeth aboue the Heauens, and extendeth it to all eternitie.</p>
            <p>Nowe our happineſſe ſtandeth in this coniunction and vnion, partlie with our Head, and our God, and with our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, to make one bodie to Ieſus Chriſt. In theſe two partes ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denth our felicitie. Thou beginneſt this coniunction in this life, but it ſhall neuer bee ended: the perfection ſhall bee in Heauen: when wee ſhall come to Heauen, &amp; meete with him there, then our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction with Chriſt, and with the members of his body, men and Angels ſhall be perfect. The thing that worketh this coniunction, and bringeth out charitie, and ioyneth thee with thy neighbour, is faith in Chriſt: for we liue by faith, and not by ſight: when thou caſteſt thine eye afarre off to Chriſt, (for he is as farre from thee as the Earth is from the Heauen) howbeit thou be in heauineſſe and languor, thou ſhalt once get peace and ioye, when thou lookeſt to Heauen. It is but a farre ſight, to looke thorowe the clowdes, to ſee thy Redeemeer at the right hande of the Father: but this is not the perfection: the accomplishment is by a full and cleare ſight, when wee ſhall pierce the Heauens, and ſhall ſee him, not in a mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, but face to face: then the members ſhall bee perfected, when wee ſhall ſee him, and the glorie that the Father hath giuen vnto him. This is common: But, O that thou couldeſt feele it ſenſiblie in thine heart, to thy ioy and conſolation! <hi>J will, that they be where I am, that they may ſee the glorie that thou haſt given mee, before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the worlde.</hi> Ere euer wee gette the preſence of IESVS CHRIST, ere wee ſee him face to face, wee muſt chaunge our dwelling place: wee will not gette the ſight of Chriſt heere in this Earth: Looke not to gette the ſight of that glorie heere in the Earth: thou muſt flitte out of the Earth, to the Heauen: Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer ſoule would ſee his glorie, that ſoule muſt flitte: and before euer wee chaunge our dwelling place, wee muſt firſt be chaunged: wee muſt haue a chaunge of our ſelues: There is neuer anie man, nor woman, that ſhall gette entrie into that SAnctuarie where the LORD IESVS ſitteth in glorie, but hee who is chaunged in himſelfe: It is impoſſible for a man or a woman to enter into Heauen, with this mortalitie, or with this death, or with this corruption. What are vvee but dead, and mortall creatures? Then, thou muſt chaunge corruption, into corruption; and thou muſt chaunge thy mortall bodie, into a glorious bodie. Nowe, this chaunge of man and woman cannot bee but by death: What
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:16631:131"/>
ſtriketh more terrour to thine heart than death? Yet there is no chaunge, but by death or elſe that which ſhall ſtande vs in ſteade of death: as when Chriſt ſhall come the clowdes in the latter day, wee muſt bee chaunged in the twinkling of an eye. This doctrine tendeth to this, that wee abhorre not death altogether, and the leauing of this life, that deat bee not ſo heauie to vs: for howbeit nature abhorre it, yet of a mortall bodie, it maketh an immortall, and it tendeth to take thee out of this Earth, and to tranſport thee to that Heauenlie Paradiſe, where Jeſus Chriſt ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in glorie: Yea, and this I affirme, There is no man, nor wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that hath a deſire to bee with Chriſt, but hee groaneth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the burthen of mortalitie, and would willingly imbrace death, to bee with Chriſt: yea, the rememberance of his departure out of this life, is ioyfull to him. Fie vpon that man, who hath his heart and affections knitee and glewed to the world, euer ſeeking worldie honours, or pleaſures, &amp;c. Thou ſouldeſt haue that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition which <hi>Paul</hi> had: looke what hee hee ſayeth, <hi>J deſire to bee diſſolued: I haue confidence, that J ſhall yet remaine with you, but I chooſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to flitte out of this bodie, and to goe and dwell with my Lord.</hi> Let vs not bee like <hi>Ethnickes,</hi> who haue no bleſſedneſſe, but beaſtlie bleſſedneſſe, and looke for no bleſſedneſſe after his life. If thou haue not an eye to Heaven, and to that heauenlie bleſſednſſe, there is no bleſſedneſſe for thee.</p>
            <p>This is to bee marked: Who is it that will make this flitting from the Earth, to Heauen? Not euerie bodie, but onelie ſo manie as the Father hath choſen from all eternitie. Neuer one ſhall gette entrie to that Light, and to that holie Sanctuarie, but that ſoule whome the Father hath giuen to the Sonne. If thou bee once gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the Sonne, and once put into his handes, howbeit thou bee a Pilgrime for while, (for thine inheritance is not heere:) how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit thy bodie bee walking in ſadneſſe and heauineſſe, howbeit thou bee wandering farre from Chriſt on the Earth, yet of neceſſitie thou ſhalt once dwell where Chriſt is. This doctrine is verie common, yet comfortable: That bodie that is ſeparated from his Lord, and getteth not that fruition of his preſence, once hee ſhall goe, where he ſhall get that preſence, howbeit not incontinent, once hee ſhall bee lifted vp aboue the Earth, and ſhall dwell in glorie with Ieſus Chriſt. The thing in the world that ſhould be moſt perſwaded of, is, That we are giuen to Ieſus Chriſt. There is no conſolation for thee, and thou needeſt not looke euer to dwell
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:16631:132"/>
in Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with Ieſus Chriſt, if thou findeſt not this perſwaſion, that Ieſus Chriſt is become thy Lord, and hath conqueſſed thee out of the handes of ſinne and death. There is none other conſolation in life, (although thou ſhouldeſt liue ten thouſande yeeres,) and much more in death, without this, thou ſhalt find no conſolation: but euen in death, if thou findeſt this perſwaſion, that thou lyeſt ſleeping in the armes of Ieſus Chriſt, then thou ſhalt finde conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: and when the ſoule is departing out of the bodie, it ſhall find in experience that joye.</p>
            <p>Nowe yet the ende would bee marked: There is the ende, <hi>That they may ſee my glorie that thou haſt giuen mee.</hi> It is true indeede, in this life the faythfull get a ſight of the glorie of Ieſus Chriſt: for if there were not a ſight of that glorie, wherefore would all the pleaſure of the worlde ſerue? Thou wiſt neuer what joye meaned, if thou getteſt not a ſight of that glorie: But yet, I ſay, all the ſight of Ieſus Chriſt, which wee haue in this life, is, as it were, but in a mirrour, and in a looking-glaſſe: it is but a darke ſight that thou haſt of him: This is by the Preaching of the Goſpel, wherein yee haue Chriſt, first crucified, and then glorified. What is our Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, but that Chriſt hath beene firſt crucified, and nowe glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, at the right hande of the Father, for the juſtification and ſanctification of the worlde? This is that darke ſight which wee haue heere: but one daye wee ſhall bee there where hee is, and wee ſhall ſee him face to face, and wee ſhall ſee ſuch a glorious Majeſtie, as wee would neuer haue looked for: thou canſt not looke for enough: hope for as much as thou wilt, when thou ſhalt bee with him, it neuer entered into the heart of man, that which once with the eyes of the bodie, thou ſhalt ſee. And therefore hee ſayeth, That they may ſee that glorie, as though they ſawe it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. Wherefore ſhall it ſerue thee to ſee the glorie of Ieſus Chriſt? When once thou ſhalt ſee that Glorie face to face, then perpetuallie, tide and time, thou ſhalt glorifie him. What is the cauſe that wee cannot glorifie Chriſt in the Earth, as wee ſhall doe in the Heauens? Becauſe wee haue not ſuch a bright ſight of his glorie, in the Earth, in this mortalitie, as wee ſhall haue in the Heauens. And if yee ſee a man, yee will know him better than to heare ſpeaking of him: The greater ſight thou haſt of Chriſt, the more thou ſhalt glorifie him. A man that hath the ſmaller ſight of him, ſhall glorifie him the leſſe: but that man that hath no ſight, woe is him; for hee will gette no glorie. Theſe diſſolute
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:16631:132"/>
men and women, who haue no delight to glorifie him, and haue gotten no ſight of him, ſhall gette no glorie: Therefore, when we ſhall gette the full ſight, euen that ſhining ſight, our delight ſhall bee to looke to our King: and wee ſhall maruell, that euer creature could ſee ſuch a glorie: and wee ſhall delight to glorifie him that ſitteth vpon the Throne: and when we ſhall ſee him, then daye and night our Song ſhall bee as it is written, in the <hi>Revelation, Chap. 4. Verſ. 8. Holie, holie, holie, is the Great GOD Almightie, who was, and who is, and who is to come.</hi> What is the cauſe of that? Becauſe of the brightneſſe of the glorie, which ſhall ſtrike out from him, vpon vs: the crie ſhall neuer goe out of our mouth. Well is that ſoule that will ſtriue to glorifie him! And that ſoule that can once ſtudie to glorifie him, that ſoule ſhall ſaye for euer, Holie is the Lord. But ſhall wee not bee the better of it? When thou loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt to a King in his glorie, thou art neuer an haire the better: But it ſhall bee farre otherwayes with thee, when thou ſhalt ſee him. So ſoone as wee ſhall ſee that glorie, wee ſhall bee as ſoone transformed: that bright face of the Sunne of Righteouſneſſe, ſhall ſtrike out the beames of his glory vpon thee, and the beames ſhall goe to thine heart, and ſhall illuminate thy ſoule, and ſhall ſhoote out that darkneſſe, and ſhall make thy bodie ſhine more brightlie that the Sunne. So wee ſhall not ſo ſoone ſee him face to face, after that glorious Reſurrection, but as ſoone thou ſhalt bee transformed to glorie, and thou ſhalt ſhine like an Angel of Light. Looke to the ende of the third <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>Paul</hi> in the <hi>2. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt.</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians: Wee, with vncouered faces, beholde, as in a mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, the glorie of the Lord; and it transformeth vs into that ſame image, from glorie to glorie.</hi> The more that a man heareth of the Goſpel, the ſoule is the more illuminate: and the bodie that will take heede, will finde the glorifying of the ſoule in ſome meaſure: and then, when wee ſhall ſee him out of the bodie, when we ſhall blinke on that glorious countenance, then both bodie and ſoule ſhall bee glorified.</p>
            <p>He draweth the glorie which the Father hath giuen him from the ground, <hi>Becauſe thou haſt loued mee before the foundation of the worlde was laid.</hi> The glory the Father giueth to the Sonne, is of an infinite loue, and vnſpeakeable. Would yee meaſure the glorie of the Sonne, and the greatneſſe of it, and when it beganne? Looke to the loue the Father bare to the Sonne: in greatneſſe it is infinite: thine heart is not capable of the thouſand part of that loue: It
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:16631:133"/>
is infinite. Who can tell it? How can my finite heart tell it? If the loue be infinite, then the glory is infinite. He ſayd, his Father lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him from all eternitie: that loue had neuer a beginning, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the glory had neuer a beginning, as hee ſayth himſelfe before in the <hi>5. verſ.</hi> of this <hi>Chap.</hi> Wouldeſt thou know the end? It hath none ende. It is not like the loue of man: the loue of the Father to the Sonne, it is euerlaſting: and therfore, the glory of Ieſus Chriſt it ſhall neuer haue an end, howbeit it was obſcured for a time. Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ye may perceiue, when he ſpeaketh of his glory, he draweth in the loue of the Father, to himſelfe. This is an argument, that in ſpeaking of that glory, he hath a ſenſe of that infinite loue. So the joye, and the glory, of the Sonne of God, wherein ſtandeth it? His ioy, and glory, ſtandeth, in that he hath gotten it, not with reafe or robbery, but with the loue of the Father. Wouldeſt thou poſſeſſe any benefit of God with pleaſure? &amp; wouldeſt thou haue ioy with it? What if thou hadſt all the world, and hadſt no pleaſure nor ioy in it? All gifts are from the Father of Heauen, the Father of Ieſus Chriſt. Wouldeſt thou then haue pleaſure in the gift? Looke that the giuer loue thee, ſtriue to feele that hee giueth thee it in loue: and then, though the gift bee neuer ſo ſmall, yea, if it were but a Dinner, or a fill of Meat, thou ſhalt haue more ioy in the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of it, if thou take it becauſe he loueth thee, than if he wold caſt vnto thee a Kingdome, if thou feeleſt not his loue. Hee will throwe a Kingdome to a Loune, to a wicked man, &amp;c. as who would throw a bone to a Dogge. But as for thee, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>thou getteſt any thing, looke thou get it not in anger, or els it ſhall neuer doe thee good: if thou wouldeſt haue it to bee vnto thee an erneſt-pennie of heauenly things, looke that thou findeſt the loue of the giuer: otherwayes eſteeme nought of it: thou mayeſt well haue it, but it ſhall be for thy deſtruction: but if thou getteſt it of loue, he will warne thee, he will make the holy Spirit to powre into thine heart, a greater ſweetneſſe of his loue, than thou canſt finde in the participation of the benefit it ſelfe. Therefore, in all benefites thou receiueſt, euer caſt thee to feele that God loueth thee in Ieſus Chriſt, who hath died and riſen for thee: And if thou haue a ſenſe of that loue, that Spirit ſhall worke in thy ſoule an vnspeakeable ioye, which ſhall bee the earneſt-pennie of that eternall ioy which thou ſhalt get in the Heauens, through Ieſus Chriſt: To whome, with the Father, and the holy Spirit, be all honour and prayſe, for euermore. AMEN.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE haue heard (Welbeloued in the LORD IESVS CHRIST) that the LORD in the laſt parte of his Prayer, which hee maketh to his Father, prayeth not onelie for his Diſciples, but generallie for the whole faythfull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the ende of the worlde. Now in this TEXT which wee haue read, hee returneth againe to his Diſciples, and hee maketh a Prayer eſpeciallie for them, becauſe they had moſt adoe in the worlde, and were to bee ſent out into the worlde, to win others to the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: Therefore the Lord moſt of all remembereth them in his Prayer, and moſt earneſtlie recommendeth them to the Father: for thoſe whome the Lord hath ordained to win others, of all men in the worlde they haue moſt neede of Prayer; becauſe if they bee not vpholden, not only are they loſt themſelues, but alſo in them ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the loſſe of the whole worlde, and of the whole Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Ieſus Chriſt, to whome they are ſent. Therefore the Lord in all his Prayers, and eſpeciallie in this his laſt Prayer, is moſte earneſt in recommending of them to the Father.</p>
            <p>Now in the laſt wordes, which were immediatelie before theſe wordes which we haue read, the Lord ſpeaketh of that loue which the Father bare to him, ere euer the ground-ſtone, or foundation

of the worlde was layde. And now in this petition that hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth for his Diſciples, hee beſeecheth his Father to communicate with them that loue which hee bare vnto him: For all graces, and of all ben<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> that hee bare to him, hee would communicate it to his Diſciples, whome he was to leaue behinde him in the worlde. The argument that he vſeth, is taken from that ende both of the knowledge that the Sonne hath of his Father, and of that whole obedience that the Sonne gaue to the Father, as alſo of the knowledge that the Diſciples had of him: the ende of all this, is, That the Father ſhould loue them: And therefore, ſeeing the ende of all, was, That the loue of the Father ſhould bee in them; the Lord beſeecheth the Father to loue them, in theſe wordes, <hi>O righteous Father.</hi> There is the ſtile which he giueth him, O righteous Father, <hi>the worlde hath not knowne thee, but I have knowne thee, and theſe haue knowne, that thou haſt ſent mee, and I haue manifeſted thy Name vnto them,</hi> and ſhall manifeſt it farther: and all to this ende, <hi>That thy loue may bee in them, and I in them.</hi> There is the whole TEXT: Hee ſtileth him Father, a warme word, and a louing ſtile: Hee ſtileth him, Righteous Father, reſpecting the petition which hee had in hand: It is a verie righteous and juſt thing, which hee ſeeketh of the Father: Therefore hee calleth him Righteous Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Thou wilt graunt that thing which is righteous and good: but it is a righteous thing to the Father, to loue them who know him, and belieue in Ieſus Chriſt: that the Father ſhoulde meete fayth in Chriſt with loue, it is a juſt thing. So, conſidering this, hee ſtileth him, Righteous, and Iuſt Father.</p>
            <p>Marke it, Brethren: Looke what thing thou wouldeſt haue GOD doing vnto thee, and what worke thou wouldeſt haue him working, acknowledge him to bee ſuch in nature, qualitie, and condition, as is the thing that thou askeſt of him by thy prayer. Wouldeſt thou haue him doing anie worke of power? Then in asking, ſtile him according therevnto, and call him, GOD Omnipotent. Wouldeſt thou haue him working a worke of wiſedome? Then when thou askeſt that of him, ſtile him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding therevnto, and call him, Onelie wiſe GOD: as DANIEL, ſeeking a Reuelation, and ſeeking out the knowledge of IESVS
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:16631:134"/>
CHRIST, ſayeth, <hi>To thee appertaineth Power, O GOD, and Wiſedome.</hi> If thou wouldeſt haue a worke of mercie done, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hende him in his mercie, and call him, Mercifull GOD, and ſaye, O moſte mercifull GOD, giue mee mercie. And wouldeſt thou haue him doing a worke of Iustice? Then looke that thou knowe him to bee a moſte juſt GOD, and giue him a ſtile con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme therevnto, and ſay, O moſte juſt GOD, and ſo foorth: For Brethren, except the heart of man in prayer, when he ſeeketh anie worke of GOD, as a worke of power, or a worke of mercie, or a worke of wiſedome, or of juſtice, &amp;c. except, I ſaye, the heart of him that prayeth, take the apprehenſion of the nature of GOD, that hee is mercifull, that hee is Almightie, and that hee is juſt, and wiſe, and ſo foorth: except this apprehenſion of his nature be in thine heart, thy prayer can haue none effect. Howe canſt thou ſeeke him to worke a worke of mercie, or of wiſedome, and haſt none aſſurance, that hee is mercifull or wiſe?</p>
            <p>So, the firſt thing in prayer, that wee ſhould ſtriue to, is, euer to haue a knowledge and confidence of thy GOD, and of his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall properties: otherwayes, the heart ſhall not bee aſſured, (thou mayeſt well pray for the faſhion,) except firſt of all thine heart and minde conceiue him, in his nature, to bee a mercifull, juſt, and powerfull GOD. And therefore, the thing in the worlde, that is moſte requiſite, is to knowe GOD, ſo farre as this little heart and minde can conceiue and gripe that infinite Majeſtie: It is needfull for thee to knowe that glorious Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, in thoſe eſſentiall properties, in his Mercie, Iustice, and ſo foorth: and to knowe him in all thoſe thinges in Ieſus Chriſt: for all the knowledge of GODS nature, and of his properties, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Ieſus Chriſt, ſhall neuer auaile. So the thing which we ſhould ſeeke, is to know our GOD in Ieſus Chriſt. This for the ſtile.</p>
            <p>Now to goe forward: hee commeth to the ſetting out, firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of his knowledge of the Father, and then of the knowledge of the Diſciples, that they had of the Father, and of the Sonne. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſpeaketh anie thing of theſe knowledges, he ſetteth down that misknowledge, and that wilful &amp; obſtinate ignorance of the world: <hi>The world hath not knowne thee.</hi> Alace, that there ſhould be ſuch a multitude in the world, in ſuch darke ignorance of ſo bright and glorious a Majeſtie, that ſhineth in the worlde, in that glorious worde! and yet they haue no ſight of him. Wouldeſt thou eſchewe this ignorance? and gette a ſight of thy ſinne? For the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:16631:135"/>
miſerable world, howbeit the Sunne of Righteouſneſſe be ſhining into it, it ſeeth him not, neither can it gette any apprehenſion of him. Striue to get thine eyes opened, to ſee that glory, wherein ſtandeth thy ſaluation: No ſaluation to thee without that ſight of Ieſus Chriſt: if thine eyes abide cloſe, and ſee him not, they ſhall neuer bee opened, but ſhall remaine cloſe euerlaſtingly: and neuer a ſight ſhall doe thee good, to thy joy, but that ſight.</p>
            <p>Now he ſetteth downe this wilfull ignorance of the world, and ſetteth it before the Father, to the ende the Father ſhould account the more of them that knewe him, conſidering that ſo many miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knewe him: for yee knowe the Prouerbe, <hi>Quod rarum, charum,</hi> That thing which is rare, is deare. That thing that fewe hath, it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious: the rarer fayth is in the world, the more precious: the fewer they bee that are faythfull, the more precious, and the dearer are they in the ſight of God. I tell it againe, The fewer that the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber bee, which truely belieueth in Ieſus Chriſt, the more precious are they, and the dearer in the ſight of God. The deareſt thing in the ſight of God is a faythfull man or woman in the worlde: and therefore, Brethren, this is a falſe concluſion of the Aduerſaries: The multitude with the Pope and his Clergie; the Kinges and the Princes of the world imbrace not your Religion; imbrace not the veritie of the Goſpel, which yee profeſſe; therefore your Religion is not to be counted of. By the contrary, it followeth, The worlde imbraceth it not, therefore the Lord accounteth the more of it. And if I were to make a Prayer for the profeſſours of the Goſpel, to the Lord, I would vſe this argument of the Lords, and I would ſay, Lord, the worlde ſeeth not this light, and fewe are they that ſee it; therefore I recommend them vnto thee, for the few number are deare to thee. Let the Papiſtes holde this ſtill as a true note of their Kirke, Kinges, and Princes, and the great multitude, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth their Religion: let them holde ſtill that Note, it ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them, it hath blind-folded them to euerlaſting destruction.</p>
            <p>Then hee commeth firſt to his owne knowledge, and hee ſayeth, <hi>I haue knowne thee</hi>: As he would ſay, I am in thy boſome: for the Sonne is in the boſome of the Father: and I am one with thee, in eſſence, and in nature, and I ſit with thee in that eternall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and I ſee thy minde, and thine heart: all that is in the Father, the Sonne knoweth it. Now with this knowledge is vnderſtood that obedience and humble ſubjection the Sonne gaue to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: all tendeth to this, that the Father ſhould loue his Diſciples,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:16631:135"/>
and the faythfull: All the obedience and knowledge of the Sonne to the Father, tendeth to this, That the Father ſhould loue vs. Well then, hee that prayeth for the Diſciples, hee is a good man, and knoweth God moſt perfectlie. And no queſtion, this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which he alleadgeth, it is a great argument of this petition. The perſon of him that prayeth, and maketh interceſsion to the Lord for another, is much to bee regarded: hee draweth a great weight with him, if hee bee a man that feareth God, a good man, and one that knoweth God, and belieueth in Ieſus Chriſt: in a worde, if hee bee ſuch a one as the Lord accepteth of, and fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, certainlie the Prayer of that man, either for himſelfe, or for anie other, is powerfull: as IAMES ſayeth, <hi>The prayer of a just man auaileth much, if it bee feruent. Iames, Chapter 5.Verſ. 16.</hi> Is it the Prayer of euerie man that will auaile? No: It is the Prayer of the juſt man, who hath the Spirite of Prayer. It is a wonderfull thing, to conſider, howe piercing the Prayer of that man will bee, and howe it will paſſe vp, and pierce thorowe the viſible clowdes, and all theſe viſible Heauens, and neuer reſt till it come to the eares of the Lord: It will paſſe thorowe that light which hath none acceſſe. That Spirite that conuoyeth thy Prayer to the Heauens, is not thy ſpirite, or the ſpirite of a man: but it is his owne Spirite, and the Lord knoweth what is the ſenſe of his owne Spirite.</p>
            <p>That thing I ſpeake of Prayer, I vnderſtand it of all the works, and of all the turnes that proceede of the man that is acceptable to God: if hee haue that holie Spirit, whatſoeuer hee doeth, it is as a ſweete ſmelling Sacrifice in the eyes of the Lord. All that proceedeth of that man, who hath the holie Spirite, and whoſe perſon is acceptable in the ſight of God, is ſo ſweete to the Lord, that hee accounteth much of it. And by the contrarie, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, A man, or a woman, whoſe perſon is not acceptable to God, and whome God liketh not of, no, bee what hee will, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hee were a King of the worlde, the Lord will not looke vpon anie thing that will proceede from that man, or that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, though it had neuer ſo faire an outwarde ſhowe. Looke to ABEL, and KAIN: When ABEL offered an Offering to the LORD, the LORD<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> looked on ABEL, and his Offering: he accepted firſt of the man, and therefore of the Offering. Come to KAIN: I thinke hee had as good an Offering, and largelie better; yet the LORD would not looke to the Offering, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:16631:136"/>
hee would not looke on him that offered it. The LORD hated KAIN, and therefore becauſe the perſon was not accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, hee would not looke vpon the Offering.</p>
            <p>This is a neceſſarie Leſſon: If thou wouldeſt doe anie thing in this worlde, or ſpeake or praye for thy ſelfe, anie thing elſe, looke that God haue a liking of thy perſon: looke that thou bee acceptable, and in the fauour of thy God: ſtudie to bee approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of God: ſtudie to ſanctification, and holineſſe of heart, and ſticke to Ieſus Chriſt: for fayth in him maketh thee pleaſant vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God: wanteſt thou fayth, thou ſtinkeſt in his ſight, and the Lord will not looke vpon thee, no more than on a dead carion, if thou bee not clad with that innocencie of his. So, let euerie one of vs take heede to our ſelues.</p>
            <p>Now to goe forward: When he hath ſet downe his knowledge, hee commeth to the knowledge of his Diſciples: <hi>And they knowe, that thou haſt ſent mee, and I haue reuealed thy Name vnto them, and will reueale it more, that thy loue, wherewith thou haſt loued mee, may bee in them, and J in them.</hi> Heere is a promiſe of the thing to come. If yee will conſider the wordes, the knowledge of his Diſciples, which hee ſetteth downe before the Father, it is partlie preſent, and partlie to come. The knowledge preſent, is partlie of the Sonne, That the Father ſent him, and partlie of the Father him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Concerning the Sonne, <hi>They knowe, that thou haſt ſent mee</hi>: That is to ſaye, Father, they haue knowne, that I am thy Sonne, and thine onelie begotten, equall with thee from all eternitie, and in time ſent to this miſerable worlde: and, that I am the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Ambaſſadour: and, that I am the Redeemer of the worlde. The Leſſon is this: Hee recommendeth his Diſciples to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that, from the knowledge which the Diſciples had firſt of the Sonne, and then of the Father. I ſayde before, that the perſon of him who maketh prayer, is of great weight in the ſight of God: I ſaye the ſame of him, for whome one prayeth: if hee bee one that hath the knowledge of God, and hath fayth in Ieſus Chriſt, one whome the Lord regardeth, and who is acceptable to God, ſurelie the Lord verie readilie will heare prayers for him: for (Brethren) there is ſome folke in this worlde, that if all the prayers of the worlde were powred foorth for them, and if all the worlde ſhould praye for them, it ſhall neuer auaile in the ſight of God: as it is ſayde in the fifteenth <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>Ieremie,</hi> Though <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> ſhould pray for ſome men, hee would not heere: If
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:16631:136"/>
               <hi>Noah, Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Iob</hi> ſhould intercede: that is, though all the godlie of the worlde ſhoulde pray for ſuch men, yet the Lord would not heare them: becauſe there are ſome men in this worlde, whom the Lord hath no liking of: and all the prayers in the worlde will not auaile for them, for the Lord hath caſten them off. It is a good thing, once to gette one grace of God, for thou wilt verie readilie gette another: if it were but the grace of Election: the bodie that is choſen, the Lord will verie readilie heare prayer for him. Hee who is juſtified in the blood of Chriſt, the Lord will accept of him: and hee who is ſanctified by the holie Spirite, the Lord will giue him life euerlaſting. But that man, that neuer yet hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten grace in Ieſus Chriſt, alace! all the prayers in the worlde will not auaile him, if hee bee not once juſtified, and ſanctified. It may well bee, that the Lord will caſt vnto him a temporall benefite, as a man will caſt a bone to a Dogge: but as for Spirituall grace, as Life euerlaſting, Iustification, Sanctification, &amp;c. that man will not gette one of thoſe, as it is ſayde, Hee that hath not, let all bee taken from him: and to him that hath, let it bee giuen. Haſt thou one Spirituall grace in Ieſus Chriſt, thou ſhalt gette moe: and thou who haſt none, that that thou haſt, that is , which thou conceiteſt to haue, ſhall bee taken from thee. Then, as euerthou wouldeſt haue the prayer of the godlie, to doe thee good at the handes of God, take heede that thou ſtand in the fauour of God: take heed that thou ſtand in grace: for if that thou bid anie pray for thee, and in the meane time thou bee graceleſſe, and a contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of grace, all the prayers of the worlde ſhall not auaile thee. Would to God, men would take heede to this, and chiefelie they who are in high rowmes, as Kinges, who would haue the prayers and ſupplications of others, and for whome the Subjectes of due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie are bound to praye. It is not enough for them to take their paſtyme, and to haue the ſillie people vnder them, praying to GOD for them. I praye to GOD that our KING maye take good heede to this, that hee maye bee acceptable, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, in the ſight of GOD, or elſe all our prayers, that we will make for him, will bee of little auaile.</p>
            <p>Nowe, BRETHREN, there is another thing heere to bee marked: What is the grounde of our knowledge? And, howe is it builded vp? and howe goeth it forwarde? Firſt of all, hee beginneth at the knowledge of the SONNE, I haue knowne thee. And then hee commeth forwarde, They haue knowne,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:16631:137"/>
that thou haſt ſent mee: And then, I haue manifeſted thy Name vnto them. What is the ground of our knowledge in this life? The knowledge of Ieſus Chriſt, the Sonne of God, which he hath of the Father. What if hee had not knowne the Father? Wee would neuer haue gotten a ſight of God. For why? All the knowledge that wee haue, is by the reuelation of the Sonne of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hee is not borne on the face of the Earth, that hath, or euer ſhall gette, the ſight of God, but by the reuelation of the Sonne. So manie as the Sonne reuealed him vnto, gotte the ſight of the Father: But on the contrarie, whome to the Sonne reuealed not the Father, hee gotte neuer, nor neuer ſhall gette, a ſight of him. Firſt the Sonne knoweth, and then the Sonne reuealed that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge vnto vs, in ſome meaſure. What is the knowledge that the Sonne hath reuealed vnto vs? Reuealeth hee vnto vs the Father immediatelie? No, no: The firſt thing that the Sonne reuealeth to vs, is his own perſon: the firſt ſight that thou muſt ſee, is the Sonne: and therefore, when hee ſpeaketh of their knowledge, hee ſayeth, <hi>They haue knowne that thou haſt ſent mee.</hi> And then hee commeth to the other knowledge, the knowledge of the Father, <hi>J haue made manifest thy Name vnto them.</hi> The firſt thing that the Sonne of God reuealeth, is the knowledge of himſelfe, That hee is that Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour, and that Mediatour. And when hee hath reuealed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, then hee reuealeth the Father. And all the ſight that we haue of the Father, is in the perſon of the Sonne, for hee is the ſplendor of his glorie, and the expreſſe forme of his Father: and hee, by his holie Spirite, illuminateth the ſoules of men and women, to gette a ſight of that Majeſtie. So, the ground of our knowledge, is the knowledge that the Sonne hath of the Father: Therefore, as euer thou wouldeſt haue the ſight of that knowledge, addreſſe thy ſelfe to Ieſus Chriſt, and in him thou ſhalt ſee the Father, and his glorious face, and thou ſhalt ſee that glauncing and ſhining of mercie in him.</p>
            <p>Now, he is not content to ſet down that knowledge which they haue already, but he promiſeth, that they ſhall haue it farther. Yee ſee then, the Diſciples got not the knowledge of the Father in a moment, and at once: but the Diſciples of Ieſus Chriſt, (euen the Apoſtles,) whom the Lord appointed to bee inſtruments of grace to vs, whoſe works we haue, and who were the light of the world, grew in knowledge, and faith, piece and piece, and had not all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ealed at once, but by his word, and Spirit, piece and piece GOD
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:16631:137"/>
reuealed all to them. The knowledge of God is not gotten in an inſtant, in this worlde: and the Lord himſelfe, who is the giuer of that knowledge, he giueth it to no man nor woman in an inſtant, but piece and piece, the man, or the woman, groweth in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: ſo long as wee are clogged with this mortalitie, ſo long the knowledge of God ſhall neuer bee perfect. Therefore, let euerie man, if hee haue a pleaſure to ſeeke God, trie that grouth that hee hath in knowledge. That is a vaine ſoule, and a miſerable ſoule, which will ſtand vp, and ſay, I haue knowledge enough, I will goe no farther. Knowledge muſt haue a grouth in this worlde. Woe is that man, that will ſaye, I will ſet downe my ſtaffe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as though hee would haue no more knowledge: Thou wiſt neuer what joye was in the knowledge of God, who wilt ſaye thus: if thou hadſt a loue of it, thine heart would ſeeke to gette the full knowledge of God: for that heart will not bee content of a meane meaſure of knowledge, but goeth forwarde from knowledge to knowledge: Seeing it is Life, as the Lord ſayeth, <hi>This is Life eternall, to knowe thee, and whome thou haſt ſent, IES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST.</hi> If once thou ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtedſt of that knowledge of God in Ieſus Chriſt, thou wouldeſt neuer ſaye, I will ſet downe my ſtaffe. Let aye a continuall ſtrife bee, to knowe more and more, till this fayth bee turned into ſight: when wee ſhall meete with our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, then wee ſhall gette that ſweete and joyfull ſight, to ſee him face to face: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs not reſt, till wee gette that full illumination.</p>
            <p>Another thing is to bee marked heere: Whome once the Lord hath begunne to inſtruct, man or woman, hee leaueth not off. If Chriſt beginne to teach thee by his Spirite, hee teacheth not as men will teach, who will teach this yeere, and leaue off the next yeere: But if hee take a man or a woman in hande, continuallie hee teacheth them. And if this bee true, that continuallie hee reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, and teacheth; that is alſo true, there is no man, nor woman, who hath begunne to gette knowledge by his teaching, but that man, or woman, muſt growe, and cannot goe backe. It is a vaine thing to ſaye, A man, or a woman, who hath gotten true fayth in ſome meaſure, (although it were no greater than a graine of Muſtard-ſeede,) that hee can loſe the fayth which hee hath once gotten. As Ieſus Chriſt cannot reſt in thy ſoule, but aye goe forwarde, till fayth bee turned into ſight: ſo I ſaye thus, (to refute thoſe, who ſay, that they who haue gotten true fayth, can loſe it,) hee that hath gotten the holie Spirite, can neuer loſe him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="266" facs="tcp:16631:138"/>When hee hath ſette downe before the Father, firſt, his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Father: and ſecondlie, the knowledge that the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples had of the Father: partlie that which they had preſentlie: and partlie that which was to come: nowe hee commeth to the ende, and ſayeth, All this is to the ende, <hi>That thy loue may bee in them, and I in them.</hi> All this knowledge of God, and all this fayth in Ieſus Chriſt, looke to the ende of it, all tendeth to this ende, That God may loue vs, and wee may feele in our heartes this loue of God. Therefore (Brethren) marke it well, Count not of knowledge, euen of the knowledge of God, except that thou feeleſt the loue of God following vpon it: looke that all thy knowledge of God bee with a ſenſe and feeling of this loue, that God loueth thee. Whereto ſerueth the knowledge of God vnto thee, if thou haue no ſenſe and no feeling of the loue of God? Some men and vvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men will glorie, that they knowe this, and that, and thus farre of God: and in the meane time, they take no heede to that ſenſe of the loue of God in the heart. I had rather haue a little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, with the ſenſe of that loue wherewith hee loueth mee, than all the knowledge vnder the Sunne, if mine heart bee voyde of that ſweete loue.

And aye the more wee know, the greater ſhould bee the ſenſe of the loue of God. Therefore, let vs ſtriue to feele the ſenſe chiefelie of that mercie, and that loue: and then our knowledge ſhall bee joyfull and pleaſant vnto vs. But heere I aske a queſtion, Beganne God to loue vs then onelie, when wee beganne to knowe him? Beganne not God to loue euerie one of vs, before wee knewe him? Appearinglie in this place, as it would ſeeme, hee maketh the loue of God to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne and flowe of the knowledge of God. The aunſwere is eaſie: Looke the wordes: hee ſayeth, That thy loue may bee in them. It is true, from all eternitie, ere euer wee were in the worlde, (I ſpeake of the Choſen,) hee loued vs, and of loue hee chooſed vs: and hee loued vs after wee came into the worlde: When wee were enemies to him, hee loued vs.</p>
            <p>But marke againe, Brethren, The loue of God is neuer in vs, but without vs, till wee knowe him, and haue fayth in Ieſus Chriſt: That is the meaning, Neuer one feeleth in their heart, that God loueth them, but hee who knoweth God. Hee loueth
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:16631:138"/>
thee, but thou feeleſt it not, till thou, haſt gotten knowledge: and then when thou haſt gotten knowledge, thou beginneſt to feele it, and to haue a ſenſe of that loue in thine heart. And this is it that the Apoſtle ſayeth, <hi>Rom. 5. verſ. 5.</hi> The loue of God is ſhed abroade in our heartes, through that holie Spirite which is giuen vs. Before wee gette that knowledge, there is no ſhedding abroade of that loue in the heart: But when thou getteſt the knowledge of God, and fayth in Ieſus Chriſt, then thou feeleſt that loue, with a ſweetneſſe and joye vnſpeakeable. Experience may tell vs this: Thou that haſt not gotten fayth in Ieſus Chriſt at anie time, and knoweſt not God, I appeale thy conſcience, if euer thou haſt felt the loue of God? Sayeſt thou, that thou feeleſt Gods loue? I dare ſaye, that thou feeleſt it not. And by the contrarie, when men and women knowe God, and finde fayth in Ieſus Chriſt, from whome all grace floweth, and diſtilleth into our ſoules, they ſhall finde in experience, with the knowledge, ſuch a ſweete ſenſe of loue, that the tongue of man nor Angel cannot expreſſe. And therefore, as euer thou wouldeſt feele the loue of God, (What pleaſure canſt thou haue without that ſenſe?) as euer thou wouldeſt haue joye and comfort in thine heart, in the middeſt of the miſeries of this world, learne to know God: aſſuring thy ſelfe, that before thou get the ſight and knowledge of God in Ieſus Chriſt, thou ſhalt neuer get the ſenſe of loue. Striue to ſee God, &amp; haue faith in Ieſus Chriſt: and the farther ſight thou getteſt of him, thy delight ſhall bee to pierce in more and more into the myſterie of thy ſaluation: and I promiſe thee in his Name, that ſenſe and feeling ſhall increaſe: and the more thou ſeeſt and knoweſt, the more thou ſhalt feele that loue of God. So, wouldeſt thou haue joye and comfort, ſtriue to ſee Chriſt, and thinke not that thou canſt ſee enough. Now, would to God wee had the halfe of that deſire, to looke into the face of Ieſus Chriſt, that we haue of worldly things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For al our bleſſednes and comfort, ſtandeth in this, to look into the face of Ieſus Chriſt, that the beams which ſtrike out from him, may ſhine in our ſouls.</p>
            <p>In the laſt words, he ſayth, <hi>And I in them.</hi> He commendeth this preſence of the loue of God in their harts, by the preſence of Chriſt himſelfe, who accompanieth it: as if hee had ſayde, So ſhall it bee ſeene, if thy loue bee in them, that I am in them. Theſe two are inſeparable Companions, the loue of the Father, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Sonne, in the heart. Is the loue of the Father in thine heart? Then IESES CHRIST is there. And by the contrarie: is
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:16631:139"/>
IESVS CHRIST into thine heart? then the loue of the Father is into thine heart: theſe two goe inſeparable together, and where the one lodgeth, the other muſt bee there alſo. Bleſſed are they that feele the loue of God, for Chriſt is with them in their heartes: for one grace draweth on another: And if thy God loue thee, the glorious Spirite ſhall bee with thee. A queſtion here may bee moued: There are two Companions heere, the loue of the Father, and the preſence of the Sonne: but which of them is firſt? Whether is the preſence of the Sonne, or the loue of God in thine heart, firſt? I anſwere: Howbeit they bee in thine heart together, in one moment of time, yet the one in order, is before the other: And firſt, Ieſus Chriſt taketh poſſeſsion in thine heart, ere the loue of the Father bee in thine heart: And becauſe Ieſus Chriſt is ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into thine heart, therefore the loue of the Father is into thine heart. Before Chriſt came into thine heart, there was neuer grace in it: all the grace, all the peace, and all the joy, and all the comfort that is in the heart of a ſinner, followeth on Chriſt: Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth firſt, and then all grace commeth in after him: Hee is neuer him alone, but peace, joye, and gladneſſe accompany him: then followeth that joye when hee commeth. Looke <hi>Rom. 5. verſ. 5.</hi> hee telleth vs this order, when hee hath ſaid, <hi>Becauſe, when wee were enemies, Chriſt died for vs</hi>: Becauſe Chriſt died for thee, hee loued thee. And thinkeſt thou, that thou wouldeſt feele that loue of God, if Chriſt had not died for thee, and except thou imbrace in thine heart that death, by a liuelie fayth? Goe to experience. What is hee, or ſhee, that will feele that loue of God, that endleſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, or that peace, or joye, who belieueth not in Ieſus Chriſt? It ſhall paſſe thy power, to feele anie joye, before thou feele that Chriſt died for thee. Therefore, I beſeech thee, gripe greedilie to Ieſus Chriſt, that hee may dwell in thine heart.</p>
            <p>Nowe yee may aske at mee, Howe is Chriſt in the heart? Is not Chriſt bodilie preſent at the right hand of the Father? How then ſayeth hee, <hi>And I in them</hi>? Howe can thine heart gette him, vvho is in Heauen? The anſwere is eaſie. The Lord Ieſus dwelleth in the heart of man, and woman, by fayth. Belieueſt thou in him? Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth thine heart thorowe the Heauens, to get a gripe of him? If thou belieue, (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayeth, <hi>Epheſ. 3. verſ. 17.</hi>) Chriſt dwelleth in thee, if thine heart bee ſet on him, and if thou belieue that hee died, and is riſen for thee, thou haſt him dwelling in thee.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="269" facs="tcp:16631:139"/>And thinke yee, Brethren, that CHRIST can bee in any man or woman, but they feele him? No, where CHRIST is, hee is liuing in the heart, and that is a glorious life: If hee bee in thine heart by fayth, there hee is liuing: and as hee is liuing in thee, ſo ſhall hee make thee to liue another life than this life: hee ſhall make thee to liue an Heauenlie and Spirituall life: as the Apoſtle PAVL ſaith in the ſecond CHAPTER to the GALATIANS, and the twentieth VERS. I liue no more, ſayeth hee, it is not I that liueth, I am dead, but IESVS CHRIST liueth in mee. And what more? The life that I liue in the fleſhe, and in this mortall bodie, I liue it by fayth in the Sonne of GOD, who hath loued mee, and giuen his owne ſelfe for mee. Is IESVS CHRIST in thine heart by fayth? looke the effectes: firſt, thou art dead, this mortall life is mortified, the olde man is ſlaine. If IESVS CHRIST bee in thee, hee will ſlaye this ſinfull life: for our life naturallie, is but a pudling in ſinne and wickedneſſe: when hee liueth within thee, hee beareth the rule, and not the olde man. And what more? As hee liueth within thee, ſo hee giueth thee another life, an Heauenlie and a glorious life. Hee beginneth within thee that life which thou ſhalt liue with him in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, where there is no more mortalitie, nor no corruption. So, all tendeth to this, Wouldeſt thou haue life? wouldeſt thou haue grace in thine heart? wouldeſt thou feele that vnſpeakeable loue in thy vaine heart? For that is a vaine heart, which is not refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and lieth dead in ſinne, and is not reuiued, and quickened with the life of IESVS CHRIST. Wouldeſt thou haue all this in this life, and in that life euerlaſting? In a worde, Wouldeſt thou reigne in glorie? Striue to gette IESVS CHRIST in thine heart; and when thou haſt gotten him, keepe him well: and if once thou getteſt him, thou ſhalt gette one of the moſte glorious thinges that euer was; euen the loue of the Father, wherein is all ſweetneſſe. That loue of the Father ſhall flowe downe to thee: and with the ſame loue, wherewith the Father loueth the Sonne, the Father of IESES CHRIST ſhall loue thee. Well, howe commeth all grace vnto vs? Euen by IESVS CHRIST: the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther powreth on all grace vpon the Sonne our Head. Nowe, hee bieng the Head, and wee the bodie, that precious ointment, and fulneſſe of all grace, which is on him, floweth downe on vs. So that grace is firſt powred out on the Sonne thine Head; and then
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:16631:140"/>
it floweth from the Head, to the members: ſo that there is not one member of that bodie, but it getteth a ſhare, though it were neuer ſo ſober a member, and if it were but a foote.</p>
            <p>Nowe, bleſſed is hee, or ſhee, that is a member of that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And bleſſed is the ſoule, that hath in it the loue of the FATHER, in IESVS CHRIST: To whom, with the FATHER, and the Holy SPIRIT, bee all Honour and Prayſe, for euermore.</p>
