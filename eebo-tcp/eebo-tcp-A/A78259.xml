            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>HAtfield</hi> Chaſe, and the places adjacent, lying contiguous in the ſeveral Counties of <hi>York, Lincoln,</hi> and <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining about ſixty thouſand Acres of Ground are all in one Level; concerning which, Sir <hi>Cornelius Vermeuden</hi> a Dutchman, in the ſecond year of His late Majeſty of ever Bleſſed Memory, contracted with His Majeſty, being Lord of the Soyl for the Draining thereof (and therein alſo for thoſe of <hi>Epworth,</hi> being about Thirteen thouſand Acres, and part of that Level, though no part of the Chaſe) wherein the King (graciouſly intending not to prejudice the Commoners) declared, That the Commoners ſhould firſt be agreed with, before <hi>Vermeuden</hi> ſhould begin the work.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Iſle is wholly in <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> and the Mannor of <hi>Epworth,</hi> conſiſting of twenty Towns, Thorps, and Hamlets (wherein the Tenants there are very numerous) is in length about ſeven miles, and lying between the River of <hi>Trent</hi> on the Eaſt, and <hi>Hatfield</hi>-Chaſe, and divers Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors in <hi>Yorkshire</hi> on the Weſt, which are Drained through the Mannor of <hi>Epworth</hi> into the ſaid River, and ſo it becometh very advantagious to the Participants, but hurtfull to a great part of the Mannor of <hi>Epworth;</hi> which the Participants make a very Sink or Pan to receive the Waters caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, to eaſe and make dry <hi>Hatfield</hi> Chaſe, and the other Mannors which lie on the Weſt.</p>
            <p>The Tenants in the ſame Mannor claim Right of Common of Paſture, Turbary, and to dig Earth there at their pleaſures to improve their Upland, and other Priviledges, which they and their Predeceſſors have had time out of minde.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Mannor came to the Crown by Exchange in the Reign of the late Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and the Tenants ſay that long before that, <hi>viz.</hi> In the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and now three hundred years ſince Sir <hi>John Mowbray</hi> was Lord of that Mannor, and made an approvement of the waſtes there by vertue of the Statute; whereupon he and the Tenants came to an Agreement, and (beſides ſeveral Grants which he made to particular Tenants) he made a Deed to Eleven of the Tenants particularly named, and to the reſt of the Tenants in general words, whereby he confirmed all their former Rights and Priviledges, and debarred himſelf and his heirs of all future Approvements by that Deed, being an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Charter now extant Againſt which Charter, and other Grants; there can be no Approvement by Law, without expreſs conſent of the Tenants, All the Law-Books being clear, That againſt Common by Grant, there can be no Approvement.</p>

Theſe four perſons, and the ſaid <hi>Newland</hi> the Agent for <hi>Vermeuden,</hi> upon an information exhibited againſt them in Star-Chamber by ſome of the Town of <hi>Miſterton-Relators,</hi> were for theſe and other abuſes done to the Countrey, ſentenced to ſtand on the Pillory with Papers, in the next Markets adjoyning, and to make reſtitution of money extorted from ſeveral of the Tenants, under colour of execution of a warrant to a Serjeant at Arms; and one of them was ſentenced to come to the Exchequer Bar with Papers in his Hat, and there to acknowledge his falſe anſwer which he had given in that Court to the prejudice of the Country. Theſe perſons nevertheleſs eſcaped the ſhame and puniſhment due unto them (by tampering with and taking off the proſecutors) by reaſon whereof the Sentence was omitted to be entred; yet the truth of this appeareth by the Note-Book yet exta<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Participants ſecond Decree was upon hearing of their own Bill, which was exhibited to ſtay the Commoners Suits commenced at Law. This Decree declares, That the Parties who are not named in the former Decree, (which are very numerous) are not bound, and that they are at liberty to proceed at Law. And as to thoſe who are named, it declares that they are no othewiſe bound, but whilſt that firſt Decree ſtands unreverſed; and in perſuance of that ſecond Decree, the Tenants have had two Verdicts in the Title, Heir<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Undertakers ſay they have been at great charges; the Tenant anſwer, That though they have been at great charges in the whole great Level, yet their charge hath been but little within the Mannor of <hi>Epworth,</hi> having made but one new Cut, and ſcoured an old Drain through the Mannor for their own advantage, and ſtopt up three old Drains, and diverted the head <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>y reaſon of the ſaid Charter, the Undertakers (coming in againſt Law) ought not to have a foot, but rather to make ſatisfaction for the wrong they have done to the Country, all the beſt ground being taken from them, and the barren ground onely left to the Country. And this Caſe being different from th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t of Draining in other places, why ſhould not the Tenants now Drain and improve themſelves, being now willing and ready to make appear how they wi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Undertakers ſay they paid a great ſum of money to the Crow, and that they have General warranty. It is anſwered, the King gave warranty no otherwiſe in the true meaning, but upon the terms in the Contract expreſſed. <hi>viz.</hi> That the Commoners ſhould be agreed with, before the work ſhould be begun. Secondly that the Tenants ſhould be left in a better condition. Thirdly, The Land to be conveyed, was to be Waſte, Boggy, and ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ground; and accordingly in the cloſe of one of the Contracts, ga<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e warranty to his Attorny-General to paſs the conveyance according to the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent thereof. The Undertakers failed on their parts in all, and therefo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e the King was abuſed, the Country damnified, and they ought on all ſides to make recompence for doing what they were never ſet on work to do, but by themſelves.</p>
               <p>The Participants ſay they have ſuffered very great damages by the R<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ots. The Tenants anſwer, That the Undertakers had a Commiſſion of Oyer and Terminer to try the Rioters, why did they not then proceed in a Legal way of Juſtice? and why not now, but that the Law is againſt them? The Tenants therefore have occaſion to bleſs God, and thank His Majeſty and the Parliament, for his Gracious Pardon; and under all, are bold to reſt upon the Law of the Land, by which they are ready to ſtand or fall.</p>
