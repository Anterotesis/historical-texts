            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THis <hi>Article,</hi> which I have now examined, was no sooner E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished, in our <hi>Scottish Claim</hi> of <hi>Right,</hi> than I turn'd serious to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy my self about it. I thought it concern'd me as a <hi>Scottish man</hi> to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, as well as I could, <hi>That</hi> which made such a <hi>Figure</hi> in the <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Contract</hi> between <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> I thought I was no less concern'd as a <hi>Christian,</hi> to be Resolv'd about its Merits: I perceiv'd it might rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily affect my practice; And tho I ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor, as heartily as any man, all break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Churches peace, for Rattles or Nutshels; Yet I could not but reckon of it as a matter of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, to me, to Endeavour to be sure that I built neither my Faith
<pb facs="tcp:101025:3"/>
nor my Obedience, in a matter of such Consequence, as I take the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church to be, on a Deceitful bottom. Perhaps I was bound to be inquisitive by some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reduplications, not needful to be Named.</p>
            <p>I had not spent much Application about it, when I was satisfied; and thought I had Ground to hope, the Wisdom of the Nation, after more Deliberate Researches, might find it Reasonable, either to Restore to the Church, Her <hi>Ancient</hi> and <hi>Iust</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or settle the <hi>New One,</hi> on some (at least) more <hi>Specious Basis.</hi> But I was Disappointed. For</p>
            <p>Three <hi>Sessions</hi> of Parliament are now over; And the <hi>Article</hi> is so far from being either Retracted or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that, on the Contrary, It hath been still insisted on, and Deem'd sufficient to support very weighty Superstructures. Each <hi>Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> hath Erected some new thing or other, upon it.</p>
            <p>This, with the importunity of some Friends, at last, Determin'd me to Enquire more fully and minutely
<pb facs="tcp:101025:3"/>
into the value of the <hi>Article</hi>; And the Work hath swell'd to such a bulk as you see.</p>
            <p>I confess I cannot Apologize suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently for my adventuring to Expose such ane ill Composure to the publick view; Especially Considering how Nice and Critical, if not Picq't and Humorsome an Age we live in.</p>
            <p>I ever thought that much of the <hi>Beauty,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Vtility</hi> of Books, lay in <hi>Good Method,</hi> and a distinct <hi>Range</hi> of Thoughts: And I cannot promise that I have observed <hi>That,</hi> so punctually, as Clearer Heads might have done.</p>
            <p>I have less Reason to be Confident of the <hi>Stile.</hi> 'Tis hard for most <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish men</hi> to arrive at any tolerable Degree of <hi>English Purity.</hi> Our great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Caution cannot prevent the Steal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our own <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Idioms</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Pens, and their dropping thence, into our writings. All things consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, I have as little Reason to think I have Guarded, or could Guard against them, as any <hi>Scottish man:</hi> For not only have mine op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, all my life, been none of
<pb facs="tcp:101025:4"/>
the best; But, for finding Materials for the following Papers, I was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to Read so many Books written in Right Broad <hi>Scotch,</hi> and take so many Citations from them, that 'tis little to be wondered, if my Book a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds with <hi>Scotticisms.</hi> I thought my self bound to be faithful in my Citations: (and I can promise I have been that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I could not Reason from the Authority of these Citations, without using the Terms and Phrases which are in them: This no doubt, makes the <hi>Scotticisms</hi> Numerous: And I shall not deny that my familiar ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with these Books, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the prejudices of Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Custom, and Constant Converse in the plain <hi>Scottish Dialect,</hi> may have occasioned many more.</p>
            <p>Neither shall I be over Confident, that, where I have adventured to Reason any point, I have done it to every mans Conviction. I may have been (as other men) apt to impose on my self, and think I have advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed just propositions, and drawn fair Consequences, when I have not done it. No doubt, most men have such a
<pb facs="tcp:101025:4"/>
Kindness for themselves, as, too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, inclines them to applaud their own thoughts, and judge their own Reasonings Just and Solid, when they are but Coarse enough; And o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may very easily discover where the mistake lies: Yet, this I can say for my self, I have done, what I could to Guard against all such prejudice and partial Byass.</p>
            <p>Sensible of these infirmities, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat the Readers favourable and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign Censures. This I can tell him ingenuously; If I could have done better, I should not have Grudg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d him the pleasure of it.</p>
            <p>But, perchance, that which I am more concern'd to account for, is, what Assistances I had for what I have advanced, in the following Sheets. And, here, I must Confess, I had not all the Advantages I could have wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Such are my present Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, That I could not Rationally propose to my self, to have Access to the publick Records, either of Church or State; And, no doubt, in this, I was at a Considerable loss: For he who Transcribes from Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
<pb facs="tcp:101025:5"/>
Records, Doth it more Secure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, than he who has things only from Second hands.</p>
            <p>Yet, I don't think this Disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage was such, as should have intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Discouraged me from the Attempt I have made: For some of my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors had Access to the publick Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters; And I am apt to believe there was not much to be found, there, Relating to the Controversies I have managed, which they have not pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished; So that, tho 'tis possible, I might have been <hi>better,</hi> yet I cannot think I was <hi>ill</hi> provided of <hi>Helps:</hi> I cannot think any of my <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Brethren can be provided <hi>much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>

            <p>I have likewise considered our printed <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliaments.</hi> The printed <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>General Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,</hi> from the year 1638. And as many Pamphlets as I could find, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the Matters on which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist: 'Tis needless to Name them here: You may find them named, as Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion required, in my Book. There are two Books which I must insist on a little.</p>
            <p>One is A <hi>Manuscript Copy</hi> of the <hi>Acts</hi> of our <hi>Scottish Assemblies</hi> from the year 1560 till the year 1616. Our Presbyterian Brethren may be
<pb facs="tcp:101025:6"/>
ready to reject its Authority, if it Militates against them: I give My Reader, therefore, this brief account of it.</p>
            <p>It was transcribed in the year 1638. when the <hi>National Covenant</hi> was in a flourishing state; For I find, at the end of it, the Transcriber's Name and his Designation, written with the same hand by which the whole M S. is written;
<q>And he says, He began to transcribe upon the 15th day of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1638. and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated his work on the 23d of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril,</hi> that same year.</q>
He was such a <hi>Reader</hi> as we have commonly, in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in Country Parishes.</p>
            <p>It is not to be imagined, it was transcribed, then, for serving the Interests of Episcopacy; For, as <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,</hi> and the Presbyterians, generally affirm, The Prelates and Prelatists dreaded nothing more, in those days, than that the Old Registers of the <hi>Kirk</hi> should come abroad: And it was about that time, that Mr. <hi>Petrie</hi> got his Copy, from which he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished so many Acts of our Old Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Assemblies: Nor is it to be
<pb facs="tcp:101025:6"/>
doubted but that, as several Copies, then, were, so particularly, that which I have perused, was tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed for the Ends of the <hi>Good Old Cause.</hi> This I am sure of, the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> as required, then, to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, by the <hi>Green Tables,</hi> is set down, at full length in the <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script.</hi> Besides,</p>
            <p>The <hi>Stile</hi> and Language testify that there is no Reason to doubt, That the Acts of Assemblies, which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, have been transcribed, word for word, at first, from the Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Records: And if <hi>Calderwood</hi>'s or <hi>Petrie</hi>'s Accounts of these Acts, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve any Credit, My <hi>M S.</hi> cannot be rejected, for it hath all they have published; and, for the most part, in the same Terms, except, where these Authors have altered the Language, sometimes to make it more fashiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and intelligible; sometimes to serve their Cause, and the Concerns of their Party.</p>
            <p>It hath <hi>Chasms,</hi> also, and Defects, where, they say, Leaves have been torn from the Original Registers: And I have not adduced many Acts
<pb facs="tcp:101025:7"/>
from it, which either one, or both these Authors have not likewise men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in their Histories.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Calderwood</hi> has indeed concealed very many, having intended, it seems, to publish nothing but what made for him; tho, I think, even in that, his <hi>Iudgment</hi> hath not sufficiently kept pace with his <hi>Inclinations.</hi> Nay,</p>
            <p>His Supplement, which he hath subjoyn'd to his History, as well as the History it self, is lame, by his own Acknowledgment: For these are the very first words of it: <hi>I have in the preceeding History only inserted such Acts, Articles, and Answers to Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, as belonged to the Scope of the History, and Form of Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Some few excepted touching Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in the Worship of God, or the Office and Calling of Ministers. But because there are other Acts and Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles necessary to be known I have</hi> SE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LECTED <hi>such as are of greatest Vse; passing by such as were</hi> TEM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PORARY, <hi>or concerned only</hi> TEM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PORARY OFFICES, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is a clear Confession that he has not given us all the Acts of As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies:
<pb facs="tcp:101025:7"/>
Nay, that he has not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>all such as concerned Temporary Offices</hi>; and, amongst these, we shall find him, in the following Sheets, more confidently than warrantably, reckoning <hi>Superintendency</hi> and the <hi>Episcopacy</hi> which was agreed to at <hi>Leith,</hi> Anno 1572.</p>
            <p>I have mentioned these things, that the World may see, it cannot be reasonable for our Presbyterian Brethren to insist on either <hi>Calder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi>'s Authority or Ingenuity against my <hi>Mss.</hi> How ingenuous or impartial he has been, you may have oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to guess before you have got through the ensuing Papers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Petrie</hi> hath, indeed, given us a great many more of the Acts of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Assemblies than <hi>Calderwood</hi> hath done; as may appear to any who attends to the Margin of my Book: But he, also, had the <hi>Good Cause</hi> to serve; and therefore, has corrupted some things, and concealed other things, as I have made appear: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he has the far greater part of what I have transcribed from the <hi>Mss.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:101025:8"/>
               <hi>Spotswood</hi> hath fewer than either of the two Presbyterian Historians; yet some he hath, which I find also in the <hi>MS.</hi> and which they have both omitted. In short,</p>
            <p>I have taken but very few from it, which are not to be found in some One or More of these Historians: Neither have I adduced so much as One from it, nor is One in it, which is not highly agreeable to the State and Circumstances of the Church, and the <hi>Genius</hi> of the times, for which it mentions them: So that,</p>
            <p>Upon the whole matter, I see no reason to doubt of its being a faithful Transcript: And I think I may justly say of it, as <hi>Optatus</hi> said of another <hi>MS.</hi> upon the like occasion, <hi>Vetustas Membranarum testimonium perhibet, &amp;c.</hi> (<hi>optat. Milev.</hi> lib. 1. f. 7. edit. <hi>Paris</hi> 1569) It hath all the Marks of Antiquity and Integrity that it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to; and there's nothing about it that renders it suspicious.</p>
            <p>The other Book, which, I said, required some farther consideration is, <hi>The History of the Reformation of the Church of</hi> Scotland, <hi>containing five
<pb facs="tcp:101025:8"/>
Books, &amp;c.</hi> Commmonly attributed to <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> by our Presbyterian Brethren. That which I have to say about it is, chiefly, That Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> was not the Author of it.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>A. B. Spotswood</hi> hath proven this by Demonstration, in his History, (<hi>pag.</hi> 267.) his Demonstration is, That the Author, whoever he was, talking of one of our Martyrs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth the Reader for a farther Declaration of his Sufferings, to the Acts and Monuments of Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> which came not to light till some twelve years after <hi>Knox</hi>'s Death.</q>
Mr. <hi>Patrick Hamilton</hi> was the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr; and the Reference is to be seen <hi>pag.</hi> 4. of that History I am now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering. Besides this, I have obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a great many more infallible proofs that <hi>Knox</hi> was not the Author. I shall only instance in some 3 or 4. Thus</p>

               <hi>Pag.</hi> 447.
<q>The Author, having set down a Copy of the <hi>Letter</hi> sent by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> (of which, more, by and by) Tells how the <hi>English</hi> Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists wrote to <hi>Beza,</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:101025:9"/>
to <hi>Grindal</hi> Bishop of <hi>London</hi>; which Letter of <hi>Beza</hi>'s to <hi>Grindal,</hi> he says, is the <hi>Eight</hi> in order, amongst <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi>'s Epistles: And in that same <hi>page,</hi> he mentions another of <hi>Beza</hi>'s Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to <hi>Grindal,</hi> calling it the <hi>Twelfth</hi> in Number: Now, 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Beza</hi>'s Epistles were not pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished till the year 1573. <hi>i. e.</hi> after <hi>Knox</hi>'s Death.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It may be observed also that he adds farther in that same <hi>page,</hi> That <hi>The sincerer sort of the Ministery in</hi> England, <hi>had not yet assaulted the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction and Church Government,</hi> (<hi>which they did not till the year</hi> 1572. <hi>at which time they published their first and second</hi> Admonitions <hi>to the</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) <hi>but only had excepted against Superstitious Apparel, and some other faults in the Service Book.</hi> From which, besides that 'tis Evident, <hi>Knox</hi> could not be the Author, we may Learn from the Authors Confession, whoever he was, That the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies about <hi>Parity</hi> and <hi>Imparity,</hi> &amp;c. were not so early in <hi>Britain</hi> as our Presbyterian Brethren are earnest to have the present Generation believe. Again</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:101025:9"/>Pag. 449 The Author, Narrating how <hi>Henry,</hi> Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Husband, <hi>&amp;c</hi> was buried. Adds, in Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his own Veracity, Thus. <hi>If there had been any Solemn Burial,</hi> Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanan <hi>had wanted Wit, to Relate o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise; Seeing there would have been so many Witnesses to testify the Contrary: Therefore, the Contriver of the late Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of Queen</hi> Mary, <hi>wanted Policy, here, to convey a Lie.</hi> Thus, I say, the Author vouches <hi>Buchanans</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; And it must be <hi>Buchanans</hi> History that he Refers to; For there's not a Syllable, about <hi>Henry</hi>'s Burial, to be found in any of his other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, Now,</p>
            <p>Not to insist on the incredibleness of <hi>Knox</hi>'s running for Shelter to <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanans</hi> Authority, concerning a matter of <hi>Fact</hi> so remarkable in its self, and which happened in his own time, in that very City in which he lived and was Minister: Not to insist on this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I say, <hi>Buchanan</hi> himself in his Dedication of his History to King <hi>Iames</hi> 6th, Clearly decides the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:101025:10"/>He tells his Majesty there were two Considerations which chiefly put him upon writing his History. First,
<q>He perceived his Majesty had Read and Understood the Histories of almost all other Nations; And it was incongruous and unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table that he, who was so well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Foreign Affairs, should be a Stranger to the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his own Kingdom. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, He was intrusted with the Kings Education: He could not attend his Majesty in that important Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, by Reason of his Old Age and Multiplying infirmities; He apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself, therefore, to write his History, thereby, to Compense the Defects of his Non-Attendance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And from both Reasons it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that <hi>Knox</hi> was Dead before <hi>Buchannan</hi> applyed himself to the writing of his History: For <hi>Knox</hi> dyed <hi>Anno</hi> 1572. K. <hi>Iames</hi> was, then, but Six years of Age: And is it Credible, that at that Age he had Read and got by heart, the Histories of almost all other Nations? Indeed
<pb facs="tcp:101025:10"/>
               <hi>Buchanan</hi> survived <hi>Knox</hi> by ten years; And, for a good many of them was able to wait, and actually waited on the King; So that 'tis clear 'twas towards the end of his days, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Knox</hi>'s Death that he applyed himself to his History. And 'tis very well known, it was never published till the year 1582. But this is not all</p>
            <p>The Author of that which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Knox</hi>'s History, adduces <hi>Bucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan</hi>'s Authority for Convelling the Credit of the <hi>Contriver</hi> of the <hi>Late History</hi> of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> which was written, I cannot tell how long, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Buchanan</hi> was Dead, as well as <hi>Knox.</hi> Further,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 306. The Author discourses thus, <hi>The Books of Discipline have been, of late, so often published, that we shall forbear to print them at this time.</hi> Now, there were never more than <hi>two</hi> Books of Discipline; and the <hi>Second</hi> was not so much as projected till the year 1576, <hi>i. e.</hi> 4 years after <hi>Knox</hi> had departed this life. Once more,</p>

               <hi>Pag.</hi> 286. We read thus, <hi>Some in</hi> France, <hi>after the sudden Death of</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:101025:11"/>
Francis <hi>the</hi> Second, <hi>and calling to mind the Death of</hi> Charles <hi>the</hi> Ninth, <hi>in Blood, and the Slaughter of</hi> Henry <hi>the</hi> Second, <hi>did Remark the Tragical ends of these three Princes who had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted Gods Servants so cruelly.— And indeed the following Kings of</hi> France, <hi>unto this day, have found this true, by their unfortunate and unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ends.</hi> Now</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Ninth</hi> died not till the 30th of <hi>May,</hi> Anno 1574. <hi>i. e.</hi> 18 Months after <hi>Knox.</hi> The following Kings of <hi>France</hi> who made the <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate</hi> and <hi>unexpected Ends</hi> were <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Third,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Fourth: Henry</hi> the <hi>Third</hi> was not Murthered till the year 1589. <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Fourth,</hi> not till <hi>May</hi> 1610. The former 17, the latter 38 years after the Death of <hi>Knox.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this Taste it is clear, that that History at least, as we now have it, was not written by <hi>Knox.</hi> All that can be said with any Shadow of probability, is, that <hi>Knox</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided some Materials for it. But Granting this, how shall we be able to separate that which is <hi>Spurious</hi> in
<pb facs="tcp:101025:11"/>
it from that which is <hi>Genuine</hi>? All I can say is this.</p>
            <p>'Tis plain to every one that Reads it, That he has been a thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paced Presbyterian, who framed it as we have it: By Consequence, its Authority is stark naught for any thing, in it, that favours <hi>Presbytery,</hi> or bespatters <hi>Prelacy:</hi> And if it ought to have any credit at all, it is only where the Controversies about Church Government are no ways in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested; or where it mentions any thing that may be improven to the Advantages of <hi>Episcopacy</hi>; just as the Testimonies of Adversaries are useful for the interests of the opposite party, and not an A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e farther: So that, I had reason (if any Man can have it) to insist on its Authority, as I have frequently done; But no Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian can, in equity, either plead, or be allowed the same priviledge.</p>
            <p>I could give the Reader a surfeit of instances, which cannot but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, to any considering person, to be plain and notorious Presbyterian corruptions, in it: But I shall only represent <hi>One,</hi> as being of considerable
<pb facs="tcp:101025:12"/>
importance, in the Controversie which I have managed in my <hi>Second Enquiry</hi>; and, by that, the Reader may make a Judgment of the Authors Candor and Integrity in other things.</p>
            <p>The <hi>English Non-conformists,</hi> zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to be rid of the <hi>Vestments,</hi> and some other <hi>Forms</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which they reckoned to be scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous impositions, wrote earnestly (as is known) to several Reformed Churches, and Protestant Divines, beseeching them to interpose with the Church of <hi>England</hi> for an ease of these burdens. It seems they wrote to some in <hi>Scotland</hi> also; probably to Mr. <hi>Knox</hi>: He was of their acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and they could not but be secure enough of his inclinations, considering how warm he had been about these matters at <hi>Francfort.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However it was, the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> did actually interpose. The General Assembly, met at <hi>Edenburgh, Decem.</hi> 27. Anno 1566, ordered <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> to draw a Letter to the <hi>English</hi> Clergy, in favour of those <hi>Non-conformists.</hi> This Letter was
<pb facs="tcp:101025:12"/>
subscribed and sent. Now, consider the <hi>Tricks</hi> of the Author of the <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story</hi> attributed to <hi>Knox.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Inscription</hi> of the Letter, as it is in <hi>Spotswood, Petrie,</hi> and the <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script</hi> Copy of the Acts of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Assembly's, is this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Superintendents, Ministers and Commissioners of the Church, within the Realm of</hi> Scotland, <hi>To their Brethren the Bishops and Pastors of</hi> England, <hi>who have renounced the</hi> Roman <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, and do profess, with them, the Lord Iesus in sincerity, wish the increase of the Holy Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, I say <hi>Spotswo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d</hi> hath it; (<hi>pag.</hi> 198.) And the <hi>MS.</hi> and <hi>Petrie</hi> (<hi>Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 348.) have it in the same words; only where <hi>Spotswood</hi> hath [<hi>wish</hi>] they have [<hi>desire</hi>] which makes no material Difference. But the spuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Knox</hi> has it thus. (<hi>pag.</hi> 445.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Superintendents, with other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters and Commissioners of the Church of God, in the Kingdom of</hi> Scotland, <hi>To their Brethren the Bishops and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors of Gods Church in</hi> England, <hi>who profess with us, in</hi> Scotland, <hi>the Truth of Iesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:101025:13"/>Now consider if there are not Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Differences between these two <hi>Inscriptions.</hi> By the <hi>Inscription,</hi> as it is in <hi>Spotswood, Petrie,</hi> and the <hi>MS.</hi> the Dignity and Superiority of the <hi>Scottish Superintenden<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s,</hi> above the rest of the Clergy, is clearly preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: By the other account it is sadly obscured; and they are made (at least very much) to stand on a level <hi>with other Ministers,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>By the <hi>Inscription</hi> as in <hi>Spotswood, &amp;c.</hi> The Sentiments Our <hi>Scottish</hi> Clergy had, then, about the <hi>English</hi> Reformation, and Constitution, are very plain, genuine and charitable: They were satisfied, that the Bishops and Pastors of the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> had <hi>Renounced the</hi> Roman <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,</hi> and that <hi>they professed the Lord Iesus in</hi> SINCERITY; And they had for them, suitably, the Christian and Brotherly Charity, which the Orthodox and Sincere Christians of one Church, ought to have for the Orthodox and Sincere Christians of another Church: They <hi>wished,</hi> or <hi>desired</hi> to them, <hi>The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of the Holy Spirit.</hi> How highly
<pb facs="tcp:101025:13"/>
this was agreeable to the sentiments of the then Protestants in <hi>Scotland,</hi> I have made fully appear in the Discussion of my <hi>Second Enquiry.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>To the <hi>Pseudo-Knox,</hi> it seems, it lookt highly scandalous, to own, That the Bishops and Pastors of <hi>England</hi> had <hi>Renounced the Roman Antichrist,</hi> or that they professed the Lord Jesus <hi>in sincerity</hi>: How could these things be said, so long as they retained <hi>Antichrists Hierarchy,</hi> or had so many <hi>Romish Mixtures</hi>? And therefore, to <hi>wish</hi> them <hi>the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of the Holy Spirit,</hi> was too bold a prayer; It was founded on a false <hi>hypothesis</hi>: It supposed they had the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> already. How suitable is all this to the Presbyterian temper and principles? And, by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, is it not evident that these alterations were not the effects of negligence or inadvertencie, but of the true Spirit of the party? But this is not all.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>body</hi> of the <hi>Letter,</hi> as recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the <hi>Pseudo Knox,</hi> there are several other Corruptions: I shall
<pb facs="tcp:101025:14"/>
only point at one, but it is a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable one.</p>
            <p>The General Assembly which sent the <hi>Letter,</hi> after a Digression con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the care that ought to be had of tender Consciences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume their main purpose, thus, <hi>We return to our former humble supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is, that our Brethren, who, amongst you, refuse these</hi> Romish Rags, <hi>may find of you, who are the PRELATS, such favour as our Head and Master commandeth every one of his members to shew to another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So it is not only in the MS. <hi>Spots<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> and <hi>Petrie,</hi> word for word, but also in a virulent Presbyterian Pamphlet, called <hi>Scotidromus,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to <hi>all Noble Scots and kind Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks zealous for the Romish Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>; written <hi>Anno</hi> 1638, to cast dirt, at that time, upon Episcopacy, and render it odious to the People; which Pamphlet I have by me, in <hi>Manuscript:</hi> But</p>
            <p>The Supposititious <hi>Knox</hi> has it thus, <hi>Now again we return to our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Request, which is, that the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, among you, who refuse the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
<pb facs="tcp:101025:14"/>
Rags <hi>may find of you</hi> (not the PRELATES, but) <hi>who VSE and VRGE them, such favour,</hi> &amp;c How unfit was it for the world to know that a <hi>Scottish</hi> General Assembly had own'd the Bishops of <hi>England</hi> as PRELATES? It was scandalous, no doubt, to the Godly: It was expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, therefore, to <hi>falsify</hi> a little, and <hi>foist</hi> in more useful Epithets; to call them, not PRELATES, but USERS and URGERS of the <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have insisted the longer on this Book, because our Presbyterian Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren are so earnest to have the world believe that it was written by <hi>Knox:</hi> Particularly <hi>G. R.</hi> (in his <hi>First Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in Answer to Quest.</hi> 1. §. 8.) where, too, observe by the way, how extravagantly that Author blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. His words are, [<hi>Anno</hi> 1559. The <hi>Protestant Ministers and People held a General Assembly at</hi> St. Johnstown, <hi>saith</hi> Knox, <hi>Hist. Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 137.] Now there is not so much as one syllable of a General Assembly in the <hi>Text.</hi> Upon the <hi>Margin,</hi> indeed, there are these words [<hi>The first Assembly at</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:101025:15"/>
St. Johnstown] But no Presbyterian, I think, (unless he is one of <hi>G. R.</hi>'s kind) will be so impudent as to say that all that's on the Margin of that Book was written by <hi>Knox.</hi> And that Meeting which was then at <hi>Perth,</hi> was nothing like that Court, which we call a General Assembly: But enough of this.</p>
            <p>To conclude, tho' I am firmly perswaded that <hi>Knox</hi> was not the Author of this <hi>History,</hi> yet because it passes commonly under his name, I have still cited it, so, on my Margin. The Edition I have used, is that, in 4<hi>to,</hi> published at <hi>Edenburg, Anno</hi> 1644.</p>
            <p>The other Treatises attributed to <hi>Knox</hi> (and I know no Reason to doubt their being his) from which I have cited any thing, are in ane <hi>Appendix</hi> to the History.</p>
            <p>I have not made it my work to cite Acts of Parliaments, and represent the favourable countenance <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy</hi> hath had from the <hi>State,</hi> so much, as to consider the sentiments of our Reformers, and those who succeeded them, in their <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> capacity;
<pb facs="tcp:101025:15"/>
partly, because the Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have been diligently collected before; Particularly, whoso pleases may see a goodly train of them, from the year 1560 till the year 16<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>7, in the <hi>Large Declaration pag.</hi> 333, &amp;c. Partly, because our Presbyterian Brethren, are in use to insist more on the <hi>Books of Discipline,</hi> and the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>General Assemblies, &amp;c.</hi> than on <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliaments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One advantage, (amongst many disadvantages) I think, I have, it is, that the Authors I have most frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cited, were Presbyterians, by consequence, Authors whose Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony's can, least, be called in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion by my Presbyterian Brethren.</p>
            <p>I do not pretend to have exhausted the subjects I have insisted on: Any Reader may easily perceive I have been at a loss as to several things in History. Perchance, I have sometimes started some things <hi>New</hi> and which have not been observed before. I wish I may have given occasion to those who are fitter, and better furnished with helps, for such <hi>Enquiries,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, if they can bring more light to

our History. In the mean time, I think<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have said enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the Reader, that our Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Brethren have not reason to be so confident, as commonly they are, for their side of the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies I have managed.</p>
            <p>Yet, after all this, I am not se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure but that they will endeavour to have my Book Answered; for all Books most be Answered, that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate against them; and they can still find some <hi>G. R.</hi> or other who has zeal and confidence enough for such attempts.</p>
            <p>Upon the supposition, therefore, that I must have ane answer, I do, for once, become ane earnest suiter to my Presbyterian Brethren, that they would imploy some Person of ordinary sense and discretion, to Answer me, and not their common <hi>Vindicator</hi> of their Kirk, <hi>G. R.</hi> for I have got enough of him, and I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline not to have any more meddling with him.</p>
            <p>Whoso reads the following papers, I think, may find such a sample of him; such a <hi>swatch</hi> (pardon the word,
<pb facs="tcp:101025:16"/>
if it is not <hi>English</hi>) of both his <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical</hi> and his <hi>Argumentative Skill</hi> (a talent he bewails, much the want of, in his Adversaries) as may make it appear just and reasonable for any man to <hi>decline</hi> him. But lest he is not represented, there, so fully as he ought to be, so fully as may justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy my <hi>declining</hi> of him, I shall be at some farther pains, here, to give the Reader a fuller prospect of him</p>
            <p>To delineate him minutely, might, perchance, be too laborious for me, and too tedious and loathsome to my Reader: I shall restrict my self, therefore to his four <hi>Cardinal Virtues,</hi> his <hi>Learning,</hi> his <hi>Iudgment,</hi> his <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility,</hi> and his <hi>Modesty:</hi> Or, (because we are <hi>Scottishmen</hi>) to give them their plain <hi>Scotch</hi> names, his <hi>Ignorance,</hi> his <hi>Non-sence,</hi> his <hi>Ill-nature,</hi> and his <hi>Impudence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Perhaps I shall not be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce every individual instance to its proper <hi>Species:</hi> 'Tis very hard to do that, in matters which have such affinity one with another, as there is between <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Non-sence,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:101025:17"/>
or between <hi>Ill-nature</hi> and <hi>Impudence</hi>: But this I dare promise, if I cannot keep by the <hi>Nice</hi> Laws of <hi>Categories,</hi> I shall be careful to keep by the <hi>Strict</hi> Laws of <hi>Iustice:</hi> I shall entitle him to nothing that is not truely his own.

To insist on all the Evidences of this, would swell this Preface to a Bulk beyond the Book.</p>
            <p>I omit, therefore, his making <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Ruling Elders,</hi> (as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distinct from <hi>Teaching Elders</hi>) of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Institution</hi>; his making the SE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIORES, sometimes mentioned by the Fathers, such <hi>Ruling Elders;</hi> and his laying stress on the old blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der about <hi>St. Ambrose</hi>'s testimony to that purpose, (vide <hi>True Represent. of Presbyterian Government prop.</hi> 3.) These I omit because not peculiar to him.</p>
            <p>I omit even that, which, for any
<pb facs="tcp:101025:17"/>
thing I know, may be peculiar to him; <hi>viz.</hi> That his <hi>Ruling Elders</hi> are called <hi>Bishops,</hi> and that their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Qualifications are set down at length in Scrip. <hi>e. g.</hi> 1 Tim. 3.2. and Tit. 1.6 (<hi>ibid. Prop.</hi> 3.4)</p>
            <p>I omit his Learn'd affirmative, that <hi>Patronages were not brought into the Church till the</hi> 7<hi>th or</hi> 8<hi>th Centurie, or Later</hi>; And that <hi>they came in amongst the latest Antichristian Corruptions and Vsurpations</hi> (ibid. Answ. to Object. 9<hi>th</hi>)</p>
            <p>I omit all such Assertions as these, that <hi>the most and most Eminent of the Prelatists acknowledge that by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours appointment, and according to the practice of the first and best Ages of the Church, she ought to be, and was Governed, in Common, by Ministers Acting in Parity</hi> (ibid.

Presbyterian Moderator</hi> (ibid. 179.) That <hi>Cyprian, Austine, Athanasius,</hi> &amp;c. were only <hi>such Moderators</hi> (ibid. 175, 176, 177, 178.)</p>
            <p>I omit his insisting on the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the <hi>Decretal Epistles</hi> attributed to Pope <hi>Anacletus,</hi> as if they were Genuine (ibid. 202.) And that great Evidence of his skill in the affairs of the Protestant Churches, <hi>viz. That Episcopacy is not to be seen in any one of them, Except</hi> England (ibid. p. 10.) Nay,</p>
            <p>I omit his nimble and learned Gloss he has put on St. <hi>Ierom</hi>'s <hi>Toto Orbe Decretum,</hi> &amp;c. viz. <hi>That this Remedy of</hi> Schism, <hi>in many places, began, then,</hi> (i. e. in St. <hi>Ierom</hi>'s time) <hi>to be thought on; and that it was no wonder that this Corruption began, then, to creep in; it being, then, about the end of the fourth Centurie, when</hi> Jerome <hi>wrote,</hi> &amp;c. (ibid. 170.)</p>
            <p>Neither shall I insist on his famous Exposition of St. <hi>Ierom</hi>'s <hi>Quid facit Episcopus,</hi> &amp;c. because it has been suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently exposed, already, in the <hi>Historical Relation of the General Ass.</hi> 1690. Nor on his making <hi>Plutarch,

Assembly of his own friends, he might have seen, that even <hi>they</hi> were Confident it could not do it. Nay, He himself, in that same 4<hi>th Section</hi> acknowledges, it cannot do it. <hi>I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not</hi> (says he) <hi>that this word is some times used figuratively, for potestative Mission, the effect or consequent of Election, and that by one Person, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out suffrages, as Acts</hi> 10 41. And I think, after this, it was pleasant enough to make it do it, for all that: But, as I said, 'tis none of my present business to debate the force of the word with him: All I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for, is to represent his super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine <hi>Skill</hi> in <hi>Critical</hi> learning. For,</p>
            <p>He tells us gravely, <hi>The word is most commonly used in his sence,</hi> viz. as it signifies <hi>to chuse by suffrages:</hi> And he proves it, but how? These two wayes. 1. <hi>Of all the instances that</hi> Scapula, <hi>in his</hi> Lexicon, <hi>giveth of the use of the word, not one of them is to the contrary.</hi> Twenty <hi>disparate</hi> significations, you see, would have imported nothing: And who can doubt but <hi>Scapula</hi>'s <hi>Lexicon</hi> is ane Uncontroverted Standard for the <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical</hi>

significations of words? But our Author proceeds: 2. <hi>It cannot be instanced that ever the word is used for laying on of hands: Lifting up, and laying them down, being so opposite, it is not to be imagined that the one should be put for the other.</hi> And what needed more after this? Yet, lest this was not profound enough, our Author plunges deeper: He will needs have both the <hi>suffrages</hi> of the People and the <hi>Imposition</hi> of the Apostles hands, to be signified by the word <gap reason="foreign">

this is one: The truth is, 'tis very hard to determine whither <hi>Ignorance</hi> or <hi>Non-sense</hi> can plead the better Title to it: For my part, let them share it between them. I shall only insist, a little, on one thing more.</p>

Then, one of his Adversaries, whom he took to task in his <hi>Second Vindication</hi> of <hi>his</hi> Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> (the Author of the <hi>Second Letter</hi>) had used the Phrase [<hi>Christian Philosophy</hi>] when <hi>G. R.</hi> thought he should have said [<hi>Christian Divinity</hi>] but, if I mistake not, <hi>G.

            <p>He told him (2 <hi>Vind.</hi> ad. <hi>Let.</hi> 2. §. 24. p. 62, 63. Edit. <hi>Eden.</hi>) <hi>He thought the Commendation of a Minister had been rather to understand Christian Divinity, than Christian Philosophy, but we must not wonder</hi> (says he) <hi>that men so strongly inclined to</hi> Socinianism <hi>speak in the</hi> Socinian <hi>Dialect. — For

In short, he pursued the poor <hi>Epistler</hi> (as he calls him) so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifully, that he never left him, till he concluded him ane <hi>Ignorant Talker,</hi> for using that <hi>Phrase.</hi> Now,</p>
            <p>Judicious Reader, was it not, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, a Demonstration of Deep thinking, and a penetrating wit, to make such a plain discovery, of such a prodigious Spawn, of Heresies, crowded into one single Phrase con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of two words, or rather in one Solitary Vocable? I say <hi>one Vocable,</hi> for it was the word [<hi>Philosophy</hi>] which was the <hi>Lerna</hi>: I cannot think the word [<hi>Christian</hi>] was either <hi>Art</hi> or <hi>Part.

Had they been in it, 'tis very like, they had come out. However, even these were enough, especially, having, in their Society, the fundamental Heresie of <hi>Ignorance</hi>: And yet after all this,</p>
            <p>I am apt to believe the poor <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stler</hi> was Orthodox and Catholick in his meaning: I believe he lookt on it as a very harmless Phrase, and intended no other thing by it, than that which is commonly called [<hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Divinity.</hi>] 'Tis twenty to one, he used it, as having found it used before him, by very <hi>Honest</hi> men, who were never suspected of any of these Dreadful Heresies: The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Lights (I mean) and Fathers of the Church, who had scarcely ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Phrase which they used more frequently, or more familiarly.

            <p>Some of these primitive Glory's of the Church, give us a Solid Reason for both the Orthodoxy and the Propriety of the Phrase. I cannot tell what notion <hi>G.

            <p>

            <p>St. <hi>Austin,</hi> (with whose works <hi>G.

The word Philosophy</hi> (says he) <hi>signifies
<pb facs="tcp:101025:26"/>
the Love of Wisdom: But God is Wisdom, as himself hath said in his word; and therefore a true Philosopher is a lover of God.</hi> And,</p>
            <p>In the <hi>ninth Chapter</hi> of that same Book <hi>Philosophari est amare Deum— Vnde Colligitur tunc fore beatum Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diosum Sapientiae (id enim est Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus) Cum frui Deo Coeperit.</hi> i. e. <hi>To Philosophize is to love God: One is then a true Philosopher when he begins to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy God,</hi> &amp;c. Nay,</p>
            <p>Tho <hi>G.

Doctor <hi>Leigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> I mean, in his <hi>Valedictory Oration,</hi> lately published, and Mr <hi>Colvil</hi> in his Treatise about <hi>Christian Philosophy.</hi> And now,</p>
            <p>Let our Authors <hi>Ignorance</hi> and his <hi>Ill-nature</hi> debate it between them,
<pb facs="tcp:101025:26"/>
to whither he was most obliged when he so fiercely scourged the poor <hi>Epist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi> for talking so <hi>Heretically</hi> of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Philosophy.</hi> By this time, I think, the Reader may have got a sufficient Taste of our Renowned <hi>Vindicators</hi> singular <hi>Learning.</hi> Proceed we now</p>
            <p n="2">II. To his next <hi>Cardinal Virtue.</hi> Profound <hi>Learning,</hi> such as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, is a teeming Mother, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly produces Congenial Brood, plentifully. Indeed, never was Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's more Prolifick. His Learning has produced crouds of <hi>Mysteries</hi>; But such <hi>Mysteries</hi> as plain speaking people, commonly, call <hi>Non-sense.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It were <hi>Non-sense,</hi> indeed, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist on all instances of this nature, which beautify his writings: Such as his pretty position, <hi>That all Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Gods worship are worship them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi> (<hi>Animadv.</hi> on <hi>D. Still. Iren. p.</hi> 30.) His pleasant <hi>Fetch</hi> about <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies that stand in the place of the</hi> Competentes <hi>or</hi> Catechumeni, (<hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Defence,</hi> &amp;c. p. 72.) His Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Conclusion, <hi>That the Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative part of the Second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is, that we ought to worship God
<pb facs="tcp:101025:27"/>
in the way prescribed in his Word,</hi> (<hi>ibid.</hi> 125.) His sublime notion about the <hi>Vnity</hi> of the Church in the Case of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> (ibid. 148.) <hi>We shut not out the</hi> Lutheran <hi>Churches</hi> (says he) <hi>from all possibility of Vnion with them; We can have Vnion with them, as Sister Churches; But we cannot partake in their instituted parts of worship.</hi> His surprizing proposition, <hi>viz. That the two Governments</hi> (Presbytery and Monarchy) <hi>of Church and State, have suted one another, many ages, since the Nation was Protestant</hi> (2 <hi>Vind.</hi> §. 11. <hi>p.</hi> 14.</p>
            <p>It were to <hi>Vie</hi> with him for his own <hi>Talent,</hi> I say, to insist on all these, and many more, such, which are to be found in his Matchless wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.

            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>D. Still.</hi> (p. 2.) had laid down this
<pb facs="tcp:101025:27"/>
Foundation, that difference of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion about a point, and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Arguments brought on both sides, by wise and able men, if it be not a matter of necessity to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, gives men ground to think that a final decision of the matter in Controversie was never intended as a necessary means for the Peace and Unity of the Church.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Against this position <hi>G. R.</hi> Reasons thus (p. 5.) <hi>If any things not necessary to Salvation, be so Necessary to be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revealed, that we are to look upon them as not Christs Truth, if there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main a Controversie about them, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged with specious Arguments, on both sides, among wise and able men, much more, things necessary to Salvation must be thus clearly revealed, so that there is no truth in them, if they be so Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; but the consequent is most false and absurd. Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. Let the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der try his skill on this <hi>Mystery,</hi> and fathom the <hi>depth</hi> of it, if he can.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The next <hi>Mystery</hi> I thought to have insisted on, is that grand one about the <hi>Decrees</hi> of God, (2 <hi>Vind.
<pb facs="tcp:101025:28"/>
p.</hi> 66.) <hi>viz.</hi> That God has a <hi>Decree</hi> that's <hi>Praeteritum as ane Act of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty,</hi> and a <hi>Decree</hi> that's <hi>Praedam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natum, as ane Act of Iustice.</hi> But I am told, this has been sufficiently represented already: And therefore I shall say no more about it, but this, that there is no Reason to think, it was a <hi>Typograhical</hi> Error: For, after it was thus Printed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> it was Reprinted in <hi>England</hi> without Alteration or Correction; So that there's all the Reason in the world to impute it to the Author: But, if so, was he not, at best, a <hi>Mysterious Theologue</hi>? But</p>
            <p n="3">3. The next I shall produce, tho' not sounding so directly towards blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, is every whit, as good <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery.</hi> The Story is this.</p>
            <p>Doctor <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> in his <hi>Vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness of the Separation from the Church of</hi> England, forbore to sustain the Lawfulness of <hi>Liturgies,</hi> &amp;c. Because Doctor <hi>Falk'ner</hi> had done it so well before: But our Author had <hi>made some Collections on the subject</hi> (<hi>Ration. Defen.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 222.) And it was pity they should be stifled; And
<pb facs="tcp:101025:28"/>
therefore they behoved to be publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I am not to insist on every thing that is <hi>Mysterious</hi> in that Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Disquisition on the subject of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies,</hi> with which he has <hi>blest</hi> the <hi>Island.</hi> One thing shall suffice.</p>
            <p>In his burning zeal against <hi>Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies</hi> or <hi>Set forms,</hi> he advances this proposition (among many others) <hi>That it is Vnlawful to worship God by a frame of service, that is not warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the word, both as to its Matter and Manner.</hi> (pag. 226. Sect. 8.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This I prove</hi> (says he) 1. <hi>From Christs Condemning the Traditions of men, as vain worship,</hi> Matt. 15.9. <hi>They taught these Traditions,</hi> i. e. (saith Lucas Brugensis in Locum) <hi>they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them, and taught others to follow them. The same Author calleth these Mens Traditions, that are so, of men, that they are not of God, or are devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by man</hi>; ibid. <hi>So also,</hi> Vatablus, Erasmus, Maldonate, Tirinus, Pis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator, Calvin <hi>and</hi> Chemnitius, <hi>say, Here is meant whatever is brought into Religion without the word: Now it is Manifest that a frame of Divine ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice not warranted in the word falleth
<pb facs="tcp:101025:29"/>
under this General Head.</hi> Thus you have all these Gentlemen, <hi>Lucas Brugensis, Vatablus, Erasmus,</hi> &amp;c. (tho' some of them were <hi>Papists,</hi> some of them <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and not one of them but own'd and used <hi>Liturgies</hi>) strong against <hi>Liturgies,</hi> if not <hi>directly,</hi> at least by <hi>plain consequence.</hi> But our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor proceeds.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>The Lord condemneth all worship offered up to him, that he hath not Commanded,</hi> Jer. 7.31. (turn to the Text and try if it is not perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently adduced) <hi>Where not being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, but devised by men, is made the ground on which that practice (tho' otherwise evil also) is Condemned: And</hi> Jeroboam<hi>'s Frame and way of service is Condemned because</hi> Devised (<hi>Heb.</hi> Created) <hi>of his own heart,</hi> 1 Kings 12.33.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Even Reason teacheth that God ought to chuse how he will be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, or worshiped by his Creatures. He best knoweth what will please him: And his Soveraignty in all things must especially appear in this that himself is so nearly concerned in. This is a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple so rooted in nature, that among
<pb facs="tcp:101025:29"/>
the Heathens, they that contrived their Liturgies, or ways of worship, behoved to pretend Revelation from their Gods, to guide them in this. It was never heard of among the more Religious Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, that Religion, or the manner of worshipping their Gods was enjoyned only by Mans Authority, and divised only by him. Yea, in the so much magnified</hi> Rosary <hi>of the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>It is alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Saint</hi> Dominicus <hi>had it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by the</hi> Virgin <hi>her self, that this</hi> Form <hi>of service was most acceptable to her; And it is added,</hi> That she was fittest to chuse what way she would be worshipped. <hi>I hope they</hi> (the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists) <hi>and such as symbolize with them,</hi> (those of the Church of England) <hi>in ordering of the worship of God, will give us leave to say the same of her Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>For the</hi> Matter <hi>of worship, I think, it will not be Questioned, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that must be appointed by God, or not</hi>; — <hi>But even the FRAME, COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>POSVRE and MODE of Divine worship should have Divine warrant, otherwise, it is not acceptable to God,</hi> &amp;c. Now,</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:101025:30"/>Not to make much needless work; Consider 1. our Authors great busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was to prove the Unlawfulness of <hi>Liturgies,</hi> or <hi>Set-forms</hi> of Prayers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the publick worship. Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der 2. that he (as his <hi>Sect,</hi> generally,) is against using the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> the only Prayer I can find of Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, in the New Testament, as to the MATTER, FRAME, COMPOSURE and MODE of it. Consider 3. that our Author would be very angry, and complain of horrid injustice done him, if you should charge him with <hi>Quakerism,</hi> or praying by immediate inspiration: For who so great enemies to <hi>Quakers,</hi> as <hi>Scottish</hi> Presbyterians? Consider 4. if his Arguments can consist any better with <hi>Extemporary</hi> Prayers, which are not immediately inspired, and, by consequence, cannot be of Divine Institution, as to MATTER, FRAME, COMPOSURE, and MODE, than with <hi>Set-forms</hi> which are not of Divine Institution as to MATTER, FRAME, COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>POSURE, and MODE. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider 5. in consequence of these, if
<pb facs="tcp:101025:30"/>
we can have any <hi>publick Prayers</hi> at all: And then consider 6. and lastly, if our Author, when he wrote this <hi>Section,</hi> had his <hi>zeal</hi> tempered with <hi>common sense</hi>; and if he was not <hi>knuckle-deep</hi> in right <hi>Mysterious</hi> Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy. But as good follows: For</p>
            <p n="4">4. Never man spoke more <hi>profound Mysteries,</hi> than he hath done, on all occasions, in his surprizing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland.</hi> He tells us of a <hi>Popish Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> since the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and a <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He tells us, (1 <hi>Vind. Answ.</hi> to <hi>Quest.</hi> 1. §. 10.) <hi>Presbyterians do not say that the Law made by the Reforming Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> Anno 1576, <hi>took from them</hi> (the Popish Bishops) <hi>the Authority they had over the Popish Church — but it is Manifest, that after this Law, they had no Legal Title to Rule the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This same, for once is pleasant enough: The <hi>Reforming</hi> Parliament, while it <hi>defined</hi> the Church of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (and it <hi>defined</hi> it so as to make it but <hi>one,</hi> as is evident from <hi>Act.</hi> 6. which I have transcribed word for
<pb facs="tcp:101025:31"/>
word in my Book, allowed of <hi>two Churches</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> two <hi>National</hi> Churches in one <hi>Nation.</hi> But this is not all:</p>
            <p>He hath also subdivided the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> into <hi>two Churches</hi> of <hi>Scotland:</hi> The <hi>Presbyterian Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the <hi>Episcopal Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He insists very frequently on the <hi>Presbyterian Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Thus, in his <hi>Preface</hi> to his <hi>First Vind.</hi> of his Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in great serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, he tells the world that, <hi>that which is determined concerning all them that will live Godly in Christ Iesus, that they must suffer persecution, is, (and has long been) the lot of the PRES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BYTERIAN Church of</hi> Scotland. And in his <hi>Preface</hi> to his 2 <hi>Vind.</hi> §. 7. <hi>I have, in a former paper pleaded for the PRESBYTERIAN Church of</hi> Scotland, <hi>against ane Adversary,</hi> &amp;c. And in Answer to the <hi>Hist. Relat.</hi> of the <hi>Gen. Ass.</hi> §. 12. his Adversary had said, <hi>that, General Assembly was as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient to represent the Church of</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>as that of</hi> Trent <hi>was to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the Catholick Church.</hi> And <hi>G. R.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:101025:31"/>
readily replys, <hi>but he cannot deny that it represented the PRESBYTERIAN Church, and was all that could be had of a PRESBYTERIAN Assembly.</hi>

            <p>He is as frank at allowing ane <hi>Episcopal Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi>: Thus, (in <hi>True Represent.</hi> of <hi>Presb.

            <p>By this time, I think, the Reader has got enough of <hi>Scottish National
<pb facs="tcp:101025:32"/>
Churches,</hi> and their distinct Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Governments. The <hi>Popish Clergy</hi> (even since the Reformation was established by Law) have Right to Rule the <hi>Popish National Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland:</hi> The <hi>Protestant Episcopal Clergy</hi> have Right to Rule the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Episcopal National Church</hi> of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> The <hi>Protestant Presbyterian Ministers</hi> have only Right to Rule the <hi>Protestant Presbyterian National Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland.</hi> By the way,</p>
            <p>May not one wish, that he and his party had stood here? For if the <hi>Episcopal Clergy</hi> have <hi>Right</hi> to Rule the <hi>Episcopal Churh,</hi> and if it was only <hi>Right</hi> to Rule the <hi>Presbyterian Church,</hi> which they had not, why was their own <hi>Right</hi> to Rule <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi> taken from them? Are not the Presbyterians <hi>unrighteous</hi> in taking from them <hi>all Right</hi> to <hi>Rule,</hi> when they have <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>Rule</hi> the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Church of <hi>Scotland</hi>? But this (as I said) only by the way: That which I am mainly concern'd for at present, is, that the Reader may consider if there is not a goodly parcel of goodly sense in these profound Meditations. Yet better follows.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:101025:32"/>After all this laborious clearing of marches between <hi>Scottish National Churches,</hi> particularly, the <hi>Episcopal</hi> and <hi>Presbyterian National</hi> Churches of <hi>Scotland,</hi> He tells you, for all that, they are but <hi>one</hi> Church of <hi>Scotland</hi>: But in such <hi>Depth</hi> of <hi>Mystery,</hi> as, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance, can scarcely be parallell'd. Take the worthy speculation in his own words. (True Rep. ad OB. 10.) <hi>Let it be further Considered</hi> (says he) <hi>that tho' we are not willing so to widen the difference between us and the Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick party, as to look on them and our selves as two distinct Churches; Yet, it is evident, that their</hi> Clergy <hi>and</hi> we <hi>are</hi> two <hi>different Representatives, and</hi> two <hi>different Governing Bodies of the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> Scotland: <hi>And that they who are Members of the</hi> one, <hi>cannot, at their pleasure go over to the</hi> other, <hi>unless they be received by them.</hi> Well!</p>
            <p>Has he now Retracted his making them two Churches? You may judge of that by what follows in the very next words. For thus he goes on. <hi>These things thus laid down, let us hear what is objected against this Course</hi> (the Course the Presbyterians were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
<pb facs="tcp:101025:33"/>
with Might and Main, when he wrote this Book, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church, might, <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mâ instantiâ,</hi> be put in the hands of the known sound Presbyterian Ministers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) <hi>First, this is to set up Prelacy among Ministers, even while it is so much decryed; That a few should have Rule of the Church, and the rest excluded</hi>: Answ. <hi>It is not Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy, but a making distinction between Ministers of</hi> one Society, <hi>and those of</hi> another. <hi>Tho' they be Ministers, they are not Ministers of the</hi> Presbyterian Church; <hi>They have departed from it, we have Continued in the good old way, that they and we professed</hi> (for who can doubt that all the <hi>Scottish</hi> Prelatists were once Presbyterians?) <hi>It is not then unreasonable, that, if they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to that SOCIETY, they should be admitted by it,</hi> &amp;c. Now,</p>
            <p>What can be plainer, than it is, hence, that they must be still <hi>two</hi> Churches? He makes them in express terms, <hi>twice</hi> over, <hi>two distinct</hi> SO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIETIES: He makes <hi>one</hi> of these <hi>Societies,</hi> the <hi>Presbyterian Church</hi>: Of necessity, therefore, the <hi>other</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:101025:33"/>
must be the <hi>Episcopal Church:</hi> And is not this, unavoidably, to make <hi>two Churches</hi>? Yet, neither is this the true <hi>yolk</hi> of the <hi>Mystery,</hi> as I take it: That lyes here.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Episcopal Clergy</hi> and the <hi>Presbyterian Clergy</hi> are <hi>two different Representatives, two different Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bodies of the one Church of</hi> Scotland. I remember, our Author in his <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Defence of Non-Conformity,</hi> &amp;c. Exercised Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> to purpose for talking of something, which, he thought, lookt like <hi>two Convocations</hi> in <hi>England</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Vpper</hi> and the <hi>Lower</hi> Houses) <hi>He seems above</hi> (says G. R.) <hi>to make such Convocations, and so there must be either two Churches of</hi> England (and why not, as well as <hi>three</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi>?) <hi>Or the</hi> one <hi>Church of</hi> England <hi>must be</hi> Biceps, <hi>and so, a Monster.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus our Author, there, (<hi>p.</hi> 195.) I say, and it seems he was mindful of it when he wrote his <hi>True Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of Presbyt. Governm.</hi> For he was careful, indeed, to avoid the making of his <hi>one</hi> Church of Scotland, <hi>Biceps,</hi> and made it <hi>something</hi> else:
<pb facs="tcp:101025:34"/>
But what <hi>thing</hi>? Your pardon for that: I have neither <hi>Latin</hi> nor <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> name for it: I thought once, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, on [<hi>Bicorpor</hi>] But I found it could not do: For he makes not his <hi>one</hi> Church <hi>two</hi> Bodies: What then? I told you already, I can find no name for it: But, if I have any <hi>Idea</hi> of this his <hi>one</hi> Church, she is such a thing as this; <hi>A Body Govern'd by two different Governing Bodies, without ane Head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That she is a <hi>Body,</hi> I think, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Controverted, for all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are commonly own'd to be <hi>Bodies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That she is Govern'd by <hi>two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Governing Bodies,</hi> is clear from the <hi>Text</hi>: For thus it runs; <hi>We will not so widen the difference between us and the Prelatical partie, as to look on our selves and them, as two distinct Churches; Yet it is evident, that their Clergy and we are two different Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives, and two different Governing Bodies of the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> Scotland.</p>
            <p>That she is Govern'd by these two different Governing Bodies, <hi>without ane Head,</hi> is likewise evident, for there
<pb facs="tcp:101025:34"/>
is not so much as one syllable about ane <hi>Head</hi> in the <hi>Text</hi>: And there's all the Reason in the world for it; For, besides the difficulty of joyning <hi>one Head,</hi> conveniently, with <hi>two Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi>; to what purpose, <hi>ane Head</hi> for her, when she is so well stored of <hi>Governing Bodies</hi>? Are they not received maxims, that, <hi>Non sunt multiplicanda entia sine necessitate,</hi> and <hi>Deus &amp; natura nihil faciunt frustra</hi>? The Definition, then, is unquestion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Well!</p>
            <p>Perhaps the Reader may be curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to know how <hi>G. R.</hi> came by this super-fine <hi>Idea</hi> of a <hi>Church.</hi> I have had my conjectures about it; And the most probable that offered was this.</p>
            <p>No doubt he is wondrously well acquainted with <hi>Plato,</hi> otherwise, how could he have made the singular discovery, that <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Stoicks</hi> were <hi>Platonists?</hi> Now <hi>Plato,</hi> (<hi>Conviv.</hi> p. 322. <hi>Edit. Lugd.</hi> 1590.) as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, has a pretty story about a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Species</hi> of Rational <hi>Animals</hi> which were early in the world, and which he calls <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as if you would
<pb facs="tcp:101025:35"/>
say <hi>Man-woman,</hi> or so: This Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had two Faces, two Noses, four Hands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in a word, it was a round Body, which contained both <hi>Sexes</hi> in it, <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Woman,</hi> as it were, united by their <hi>backs:</hi> It was a vigourous, sturdy kind of <hi>Animal,</hi> and <hi>Iupiter</hi> turn'd afraid of it, and therefore, to weaken it, and make it more <hi>toward</hi> and <hi>subdueable,</hi> he took ane Ax or some such sharp instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and clave it from <hi>top</hi> to <hi>bottom,</hi> in the very <hi>middle,</hi> as if you should cleave ane <hi>egg</hi> into two equal halves; And then, being (as you know) a nimble <hi>Mountebank,</hi> he drew together the <hi>skin,</hi> on each back, in a <hi>trice</hi>; and applyed some Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Medecines; and both backs were made sound immediately; and the divided parts of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and having the felicity to look one another in the face, they fell in <hi>Love</hi> with <hi>one another</hi>: And this was the Original of Love, and Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Marriage, and all that. Now, I say,</p>
            <p>The most probable conjecture I
<pb facs="tcp:101025:35"/>
can make of the way how <hi>G. R.</hi> came by his surprizing <hi>Idea</hi> of the <hi>one Church</hi> with the <hi>two different Governing Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> is, that when he Read this sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in <hi>Plato,</hi> it made a deep impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion on his imagination, and he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to out do <hi>Plato</hi> at nimbleness of design and invention, fell upon this stranger and more surprizing <hi>Notion</hi> of a <hi>Church.</hi> But however this was,</p>
            <p>I think our Author had Reason to say (<hi>Animad.</hi> on <hi>Iren.</hi> p. 51.) <hi>That a Church is a singular Society, and of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nature than other Societies, and therefore she ought to have a singular Government.</hi> For sure I am, he has given the <hi>one</hi> Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> a <hi>Government</hi> which is <hi>singular</hi> enough. One thing is certain.</p>
            <p>At this rate, she wants not <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> nor <hi>Governours</hi>; And, of all the <hi>Churches</hi> in the world, she is likest to have the <hi>best Canons</hi> and the <hi>justest Measures</hi> prescribed to her: For if the <hi>one Governing Body</hi> prescribes <hi>wrong,</hi> the <hi>other</hi> must readily prescribe <hi>right</hi>; For never were <hi>two Governing Bodies</hi> of <hi>one Society</hi> in greater likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
<pb facs="tcp:101025:36"/>
of contradicting one another. 'Tis true, the <hi>Governed Body</hi> may be sometimes puzled about its obedience, and reduced to a state of Hesitation about the opposite prescriptions, whither of them it should follow: But that's but a small matter; Our Authors invention is not yet so far decayed but that I can promise for him, if he pleases, he shall as easily extricate it out of that difficulty, as he can give ane intelligible account of this his <hi>one Church,</hi> with the <hi>two different Governing Bodies.</hi> Only one thing thing more I add.</p>
            <p>Our Learned Author tells us in his <hi>Preface</hi> to this his Book, in which he has this <hi>Mystery,</hi> that, <hi>it was a work not undertaken at first, of his own private motion, and that</hi> (before it was published) <hi>it passed ane</hi> Examen Rigorosum <hi>of not a few Brethren.</hi> Now, if he spake truth, here, as I am apt to believe he did not) the world may judge of the accuracy of some mens <hi>Rigorosa Examina.</hi> And so much for a Taste of our Authors second <hi>Cardinal Virtue.</hi> Proceed we now to</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb facs="tcp:101025:36"/>III. The <hi>third,</hi> which (tho' it looks as like <hi>Ill-nature</hi> as ever egg was like another) in complyance with our Authors generous inclinations, I am content should pass under the name of his <hi>Excessive Civility:</hi> I allow it this name, I say, because our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor himself hath so <hi>Dubb'd</hi> it.</p>
            <p>For thus he tells us (2 <hi>Vind. Pref.</hi> §. 6.) <hi>I have treated the Adversaries, I deal with, as Brethren; Desiring rather to EXCEED, than come short in CI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VILITY and fair dealing with them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Never was Author more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully furnished with this Ingenuous Quality, than <hi>G. R.</hi> Take a <hi>Specimen</hi> of it, from his <hi>Second Vindication,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Edit. Eden. Anno</hi> 1691; And consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with what <hi>Excess</hi> of <hi>Civility</hi> he treats his Adversaries.</p>
            <p>The Author of the <hi>first</hi> of the <hi>four Letters,</hi> that <hi>Military Chaplain</hi> (p. 14.) <hi>that man of a vain mind</hi> (p. 19.) <hi>was Guilty of the Height of Disingenuity:</hi> (p. 9) <hi>And it was the highest Impudence and Sawciness for a stranger</hi> (such as he was) <hi>thus to reproach the representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of a Nation, where he was so ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy treated.</hi> (p. 12.) And yet the
<pb facs="tcp:101025:37"/>
whole Nation knows, the Gentlemen had asserted nothing but <hi>Truth,</hi> when he met with this <hi>Civility</hi> from our Author.</p>
            <p>The Author of the <hi>second</hi> and <hi>third Letters,</hi> was <hi>blinded with Rage.</hi> (p. 22.) <hi>Was guilty of shameful Hypocrisie twisted with Malice.</hi> (p. 23.) <hi>His words were full of Monstrous</hi> Hyperbolies, <hi>if not plain forgeries.</hi> (p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Judas Iscariot <hi>was his Predecessor.</hi> (ibid) <hi>He was a Cholerick</hi> Momus, <hi>whose Patron was</hi> Rabshakeh.

R. can convince the Reader <hi>(if the Author of this Letter was the Person whom he guessed) of his most absurd and habitual lying, known to most of the
<pb facs="tcp:101025:37"/>
Nation, even to a Proverb.</hi> (71.) But I am apt to think he guessed wrong; But whoever he was, <hi>he wrote in such a violent and insolent stile as deserved ane answer of another nature than a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-Refutation</hi>; i. e. the <hi>Gallows,</hi> as I take it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The fourth Letter was not inferior to any of the rest in abominable lies and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches:</hi> (p. 81.) <hi>the most bitter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives that could be invented, filled up this Authors few pages.</hi> (ibid.) <hi>What he wrote, was not to be refuted more than the words of a mad man, or of one raging in a Feaver.</hi> (ibid.) In a word, <hi>this Letter was so unexaminable, so full of virulent reproaches, and so void of any thing that was Argumentative, that it was impossible for any man to Answer it, except his Talent for railing, and his conscience to say what he would, true or false, was equal to that of this Gentlemans.</hi> (ibid.)</p>
            <p>The Author of the <hi>Case of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted Clergy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>spake rage and fury,</hi> (84) <hi>was a malicious Calumniator,</hi> (89) <hi>a common liar,</hi> (101) <hi>most petulantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the Government.</hi> (110) Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty more such <hi>excessive Civilities</hi> he pay'd him.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:101025:38"/>The Author of the <hi>late Letter,</hi> I think, had done well, to have saved himself the labour of writing it; for, if he got not his share of <hi>G.

ever dealt with; at least, so far as I can learn by such of his <hi>Books</hi> as I have had the <hi>luck</hi> to be <hi>Edified</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. Thus,</p>
            <p>In his <hi>Preface</hi> to his <hi>first Vindication,</hi> he <hi>discharges</hi> thus against the Author of the <hi>Ten Questions,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Now when their</hi> (the Prelatists) <hi>hands are tyed that they can no more afflict her</hi> (his Presbyterian Church of <hi>Scotland</hi>) <hi>their Tongues and Pens are let loose to tear her without mercy, by the most virulent invectives, and the most horrid lies and calumnies that their wit can invent.</hi> And in <hi>Answ.</hi> to <hi>Quest.</hi> 4. §. 2. He adorns him with the honourable Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Controversal Scribbler.</hi> And the first words of his <hi>Answer</hi> to the 6<hi>th Quest.</hi> are singularly complemental. <hi>It may be observed from this Authors conduct</hi> (says he) <hi>in his Pamphlet, what it is to be fleshed in bold averring of what all the world knoweth to be manifest un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths: some by boldness and frequency in telling lies have come at last to believe them as truths,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I have also seen two Books written by him, against D. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>; One against his <hi>Irenicum,</hi> another against

            <p>In his <hi>Preface</hi> to <hi>Animad.</hi> on <hi>Iren.</hi> he says the Dr. <hi>exposed himself between principle and preferment.</hi> In the Book, he calls him ane <hi>Abettor of Scepticism.</hi> (p. 5) <hi>For the most part he doth nothing but</hi> magno conatu nihil agere.

Again, the Doctor had said that the <hi>Cross</hi> in <hi>Baptism</hi> was a Ceremony of admitting one into the Church of <hi>England. But I doubt</hi> (says G.

What a pity had it been, if such <hi>Civilities</hi> had been only dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced to half a dozen of Individuals! Our Author, no doubt, was sensible of this, and therefore, he has even thought fit, when he had occasion to extend them to whole Churches, particularly, the <hi>Episcopal Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> Indeed,</p>
            <p>The whole <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Clergy of <hi>Scotland</hi> have got a large share of his <hi>Civilities</hi>: Take this <hi>Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> only from his <hi>Second Vindication,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  </gap>ve-obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> and <hi>Non-resistance-men</hi>? But, return we to our Author.</p>
            <p>One thing may be pleaded in his behalf; It is, that this his <hi>Rational Defence,</hi> &amp;c. (as he says himself was written about the time that <hi>K. I.</hi> came to the Throne, <hi>i. e.</hi> some four years before the <hi>late Revolution</hi>; and at that time it was excuseable in him to tell his mind freely about the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> Clergy; Because, he was, then, a Non-conformist in <hi>England,</hi> and suffering under their Yoke: But now that Presbytery is Established in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and he has got a <hi>Post</hi> there, in which he can <hi>live</hi> to purpose, his temper is become a little sweetned, and he will not any more be ane Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the <hi>English</hi> Clergy. Nay, has he not published so much, lately, in his <hi>Second Vindication</hi>?</p>
            <p>True! He has: More, he seems to have <hi>promised,</hi> at least, <hi>professed</hi> so much, not only for himself, but for his whole party. He has told the world in his Answer to the <hi>first</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:101025:45"/>
the <hi>Four Letters,</hi> §. 12. <hi>That</hi> Scottish <hi>Presbyterians are far from interposing in the Church of</hi> Englands <hi>affairs: that they are not bound by the</hi> Covenant <hi>to Reform</hi> England, <hi>but to concur, when Lawfully called, to advance Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. That 'tis far from their Thoughts to go beyond that Boundary: That they wish their Reformation; but leave the management of it to themselves.</hi> And in his <hi>Answer</hi> to the <hi>Case of the Afflicted Clergy,</hi> &amp;c. §. 1. he goes a farther length. The Author had said <hi>That the Church of</hi> England <hi>should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think themselves how to quench the flames in</hi> Scotland, &amp;c. And <hi>G. R.</hi>'s Answers, <hi>Thus, they sow discord among Brethren, and animate</hi> England <hi>to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern themselves in the affairs of our Church, when we do not meddle in their Matters.</hi> Here, you see, he owns the <hi>English</hi> Clergy, for no less than his <hi>Brethren:</hi> Are they not <hi>Cock-sure,</hi> now, that they shall never have more of his <hi>excessive Civilities</hi>? Well! I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell what <hi>may be,</hi> but I can tell something of what hath already <hi>been.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This same <hi>Loving Brother</hi> to the
<pb facs="tcp:101025:45"/>
Church of <hi>England</hi> published his <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Defence,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Anno</hi> 1689, <hi>i. e.</hi> since the beginning of the <hi>late Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution</hi>: And it is evident, his <hi>Preface</hi> was written since, likewise; For there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he Discourses Rhetorically, <hi>How God, by the late Revolution, hath made us like them that dream, and done ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding abundantly for us, above what we could think, out-done our Faith, as was foretold</hi> Luk. 18.8. Now,</p>
            <p>In that same <hi>Preface,</hi> he owns, he published his Book, then, because he thought it a fit Season, and it seem'd allowable, if not necessary, <hi>that each party should put in their Claim, and give the best Reasons they could for their pretensions.</hi> Which, how it consisted with designs for the peace of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> let herself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider. This I am sure of, if his <hi>exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Civilities</hi> could be helpful for <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinging</hi> her, she got them in that <hi>Preface,</hi> with a witness. Take this for a Taste.</p>
            <p>He not only exhorts his Readers <hi>to purge the Church of</hi> England, <hi>of bad Men, ane Ignorant, Scandalous, Heady and unsober Ministery.</hi> But he farther
<pb facs="tcp:101025:46"/>
Discourses thus, <hi>God will not be at peace with the Church, while such are countenanced; and good men cannot, with any satisfaction, behold such scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals to Religion, and such effectual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of the ruine of Souls continued in the Church: — while some effectual course is not taken to remove them; The Church is like to have little peace, either with God or in her self: Let all then contribute their endeavours to have the unsavoury salt cast out — if this piece of Reformation be endeavoured, all ranks must put hand to it: The People, by discovering such, where they are; And not calling nor countenancing them when they want a guide to their Souls: And Magistrates, by endeavouring the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating of such Laws, as do, in any wise, open the door to such men to enter.</hi> And again, <hi>Church Reformation must also truely be endeavoured by us, if we would have Church peace. It is no to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for good when sinful evils, images of jealousie which provoke the Lord to jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie</hi> (such as Episcopacy, the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, Ceremonies, Holy-days, &amp;c.) <hi>are in the Church; and yet all agree in these ways, none lament them, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
<pb facs="tcp:101025:46"/>
them, nor take care to keep their Garments clean from the Corruptions of the time,</hi> &amp;c. Now, that all this is directly intended against the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is evident from the whole Contexture of that <hi>Preface.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this time, the Reader, I think, has got enough of <hi>G. R.</hi>'s <hi>excessive Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities</hi> to all <hi>Persons</hi> and <hi>Churches</hi> he has been pleased to take notice of. Proceed we now to the last of his <hi>Cardinal Virtues,</hi> viz.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. His singular <hi>Modesty:</hi> And here a vast field opens; for, except the aforesaid three, there is scarcely ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his <hi>Qualities,</hi> good or bad, that makes any considerable appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. But so it is, that generally, the <hi>greater</hi> lights obscure the <hi>lesser.</hi> Nay such ane <hi>Awkward</hi> Quality is this in our Author, that one would think, It has been at <hi>feud</hi> with it self, and had designs for obscuring its own <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stre</hi>; For you no sooner have found ane instance which you may be apt to apprehend, is the very <hi>brightest Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence</hi>; than instantly another casts up, twenty times more <hi>splendid,</hi> and before you have got through them
<pb facs="tcp:101025:47"/>
all, you are at a loss again, and you cannot tell which was the most <hi>sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing.</hi> But I shall only give a <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen</hi> of this <hi>Vertue</hi> as I have done of the rest.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Then, the blot of <hi>impudence</hi> might have been charged upon him, tho' he had said no more than what he has said concerning the <hi>Prelatical Scrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers, (Pref.</hi> to 1 <hi>Vind.) viz.</hi>
               <q>That they used a piece of cunning, in spreading their Books in <hi>England,</hi> only, where the things contained in them could not be known nor examined, but there was never one of them to be found in a Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellers shop in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where most Readers could have discovered the falshood of their Allegations.</q>
And his Brother Mr. <hi>Meldrum</hi> in his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter subjoyn'd to <hi>G. R.</hi>'s <hi>Second Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> insists on the same <hi>ingenious Speculation.</hi> And yet both of them could not but know very well, that these Prelatick Scribblers might have attempted to have pull'd a Star from the firmament, as plausibly, as to have got any thing that made against the Presbyterians printed in <hi>Scotland</hi>:
<pb facs="tcp:101025:47"/>
One thing I can assure <hi>G. R.</hi> of; his <hi>True Representation of Presbyterian Government</hi> had not seen the light, many days, when a <hi>Licence</hi> was sought for publishing ane <hi>Answer</hi> to it; But it could not be obtain'd: And how many innocent Pamphlets have been seized by the Government, since the beginning of the late Revolution? Did not both these Gentlemen know this sufficiently? And was it not <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence</hi> in them, especially in <hi>G. R.</hi> considering the <hi>Post</hi> he had, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish such a <hi>Calumny,</hi> as that it was the <hi>Conscience</hi> of the falshoods were in them, that made his Adversaries pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish their <hi>Books</hi> in <hi>England</hi>?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another instance of his <hi>Impudence</hi> might be, his so frequent insisting on the <hi>Loyalty</hi> of his party: Believe him, and no men can be more <hi>Loyal</hi> than <hi>Scottish</hi> Presbyterians. <hi>Nothing but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice can make any think that Presbytery is ane enemy to Monarchy.</hi> (1 Vind. ad Quest. 2. §. 2.) <hi>Our Obedience to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates in all their Lawful Commands, and our peaceful sufferings of unjust vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence are notour to all that can behold us with ane unprejudiced eye.</hi> (True Rep.

ad Ob. 1.) <hi>None maintain more Loyal principles towards Kings than Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians do.</hi> (ibid. ad Ob. 2.) <hi>They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways abhorred Rebellion.</hi> (2 Vind. p. 63) Yea, <hi>it is manifest, it is not their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple to bargain with their Kings about Allegiance.</hi> (ibid. p. 99) <hi>Our principles are known, that we owe Loyalty, and have payed it, even to ane Idolatrous King.</hi> (i. e. K. J. ibid. p. 115) Who can deny now that Presbyterians are true <hi>Passive-obedience</hi> and <hi>Non-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance</hi> men? Or rather who knows not that this is <hi>Bantering</hi> the <hi>Common sense</hi> of all <hi>Britain</hi>?</p>
            <p n="3">3. There's no less <hi>Impudence</hi> in the large <hi>Encomiums</hi> he makes on the <hi>Harmlesness</hi> and <hi>Innocence</hi> of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: 'Tis true, and 'tis much, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges sometimes, <hi>They are men; They have infirmities; They have been guilty of Excesses,</hi> &amp;c. But try him to the bottom, and you shall never find him descending below these Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals: You shall not find him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging that any particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, wherein they <hi>exceeded,</hi> was not very <hi>excusable.</hi> Thus, he cannot endure to hear that they were, ever, <hi>Persecutors</hi> or <hi>Rebels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:101025:48"/>Not <hi>Persecutors,</hi> for if they had been Persecutors, 'tis not to be doubted that the <hi>Prelatists</hi> had felt it. But what have they ever felt? Hear him in his <hi>Pref.</hi> to 1 <hi>Vind. It may be thought strange that the men with whom we have to do, should make such Tragical out-cries about their sufferings, when it may be made appear, that, in the late times, when Presbyterians suffered from their hands, any one of many, who may be instanced, suffered more hardships and Barbarous Cruelty, than all of them have endured.</hi> I must confess, these men who suffered so, have suffered to purpose; For, I think, it was pretty severe for <hi>one man</hi> to suffer the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation of 5 or 600 livelihoods and have 5 or 600 families, perchance 4 or 5000 persons to maintain on no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. I know not how far our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors skill in <hi>Algebra</hi> may reach, but, I think, in this, he was hard enough for <hi>Common sense.</hi> But this is not all;</p>
            <p>Hear him again, in that same <hi>Vind.</hi> (ad Quest. 3. §. 1.) <hi>All unbyassed men who know and have observed the way of the</hi> one, <hi>and the</hi> other, <hi>while they Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatively
<pb facs="tcp:101025:49"/>
had the Ascendant, will say, that the little finger of the meanest Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and his underlings was heavier than the loyns of the greatest Assembly of the Presbyterian Church.</hi> What Sir, no not the Ass. 1645, nor 1648, nor 1649 excepted? And 2 Vind. p. 23. <hi>The sufferings of the Prelatists are but flea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites in comparison of the bloody lashes that others suffered.</hi> And p. 45. <hi>Their sufferings are but scratches of pins,</hi> &amp;c. And you know, even the tenderest <hi>nurses</hi> (such as our Presbyterians are to Prelatists) cannot constantly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve their dearest <hi>nurselings</hi> from such accidents. Who can say, now, that ever Presbyterians were <hi>Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors</hi>?</p>
            <p>Believe him, and they were as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>Rebels. Episcopacy</hi> (indeed) <hi>raised a Tumult in K. C. Ists time which ended in its own ruine.</hi> (1 Vind. ad Quest. 2. §. 3.) And yet in Answer to that same Question §. 5. <hi>'Tis true they</hi> (the Prelatists) <hi>raised no Tumults:</hi> For if there is a difference between raising Tumults, and raising no Tumults, yet it is certain, that they are only <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracts</hi> which <hi>raise</hi> them, and <hi>Concrets</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:101025:49"/>
do <hi>not raise</hi> them. Well! were the <hi>Concrets,</hi> the Episcopalians innocent of <hi>Tumultuating</hi>? Consider what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>They did what they could to raise a war for continuing on the necks of the People, that Yoke that they had wreathed on them, and did effectually draw on a bloody war,</hi> &amp;c. But what did the Presbyterians on that occasion? Why? How far were they from being <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels</hi>! For, thus saith our Author (2 Vind. p. 140) <hi>These things</hi> (whatever the Presbyterians did) <hi>were done by the Body of the Nation, met in the most orderly representative that the time and case could permit; And I deny not that they were</hi> EXTRAORDINARY ACT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGS. Nothing, in these times like <hi>Perjury,</hi> or <hi>Treachery,</hi> or <hi>Treason,</hi> or <hi>Rebellion</hi> committed by Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, you see; All were EXTRAOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DINARY ACTINGS. In short, Presbyterians <hi>are beyond reproaches in the Consciences of all that know them, and do not hate them.</hi> (2. Vind. p. 37) Now,</p>
            <p>'Twas none of my designs to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Presbyterians peculiarly odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, by adducing these instances: I
<pb facs="tcp:101025:50"/>
know these Crimes are not peculiar to them. I doubt not, many of them are not violently inclined to Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution or Rebellion: I doubt as little many of them will be ready to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge they are <hi>peccable</hi> as other men; and things have been done by many of their party, which, such as are <hi>Ingenuous</hi> will not offer to <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gize</hi> for: That which I was mainly concern'd for, was our Authors <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence</hi>: For who ever saw greater Impudence than there is in these Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous Defences he has been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to publish in Vindication of his party?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Another instance might be his making his party, so frequently, the <hi>only Protestants</hi> in the Nation; The only men that <hi>resisted,</hi> or <hi>could resist,</hi> or were <hi>willing</hi> to <hi>resist Popery.</hi> Thus, the Author of the <hi>Ten Questions</hi> had said (and said truly) <hi>That the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians accepted and gave thanks for ane Indulgince, notwithstanding that they knew that all the Designs of the Court were for advancing Popery.</hi> How our Author Justifies their Thankful Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressing to K. J. for such a favour,
<pb facs="tcp:101025:50"/>
shall be considered by and by. That which I take notice of at present, is, his Apology for their accepting of that Indulgence. <hi>It had been a strange thing</hi> (says he, 1 Vind. ad Quest. 8. §. 2.) <hi>if they should have been backward to Preach and hear the Gospel when a door was opened for it, because some men had a design against the Gospel in their opening of it.</hi> (The Gospel, you know, was neither Preached nor heard in <hi>Scotland</hi> before a door was opened for it, by that Indulgence: But this by the way.) <hi>Surely their si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and peevish refusing on that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, had been much to the hurt of the Gospel; For, then, Papists (who would not fail to use the Liberty, for their part) should have had the fairest occasion ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable to mislead People without ANY TO OPPOSE THEM: On the contrary, their using that Liberty was the great mean by which (with the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the Lord) so very few, during that time of Liberty, were perverted to Popery, in the Nation.</hi> Now who should doubt, after this, that all the <hi>Prelatists</hi> were silent Encouragers of <hi>Popery</hi>? And that the Presbyterians
<pb facs="tcp:101025:51"/>
were the only People who Preached against it zealously, and opposed it boldly? Here is such a Master-piece of our Authors main talent, as I am confident no other Presbyterian in the nation will offer to extenuate, far less, justify.</p>
            <p>He insists on the same Theme, in his 2 <hi>Vind.</hi> p. 91. where he tells, <hi>That wise men thought that the best way to keep out</hi> Popery <hi>was to make use of the Liberty for setting the People in the right way,</hi> &amp;c. As if there had been no possibility of keeping them from turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Papists,</hi> but by making them <hi>Presbyterians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Near of kin to this, is that other Common Head he sometimes insists on, <hi>viz.</hi> That all are <hi>Papists</hi> or <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pishly affected,</hi> who were not for the <hi>late Revolution.</hi> Thus, in his 1 <hi>Vind. ad Quest.</hi> 9. §. 4. in Answer to that Allegation, that the Presbyterians denyed the Kings prerogative of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Peace and War, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He tells the world, <hi>If this his Argument can cast any blame on Presbyterians, 'tis this, that there are Cases in which they allow the States and Body of the Nation
<pb facs="tcp:101025:51"/>
to resist the King so far, as to hinder him to root out the Religion, that is by Law Established among them: And one should think that he might have been, by this time, convinced that this is not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to Prebyterians; But that all the</hi> Protestants <hi>in</hi> Britain <hi>are engaged in the same thing.</hi> And in his <hi>True Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present.</hi> (ad Ob. 2) He has these plain words, <hi>what was done</hi> (in removing K. J. from his Throne) <hi>was not by us alone, but by all the</hi> TRUE PROTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANTS <hi>in the Nation, who were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Concerned for the safety of that Holy Religion.</hi> Now,</p>
            <p>'Tis none of my present business to justify or Apologize for such as were, or are, against the <hi>late Revolution.</hi> Let <hi>Iacobitism</hi> be as great ane <hi>Heresie</hi> as our Author pleases to call it: Let him rank it with <hi>Platonism</hi> or <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anism,</hi> if he will: Only, I dare be bold to say that it was ane <hi>odd stretch</hi> of <hi>Impudence</hi> to make it <hi>Popery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I mentioned, a little above, his Apologizing for his party's <hi>Addressing</hi> so thankfully to <hi>K. I.</hi> for his <hi>Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And truly his performances that way may pass,</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb facs="tcp:101025:52"/>6. For another instance of his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a good <hi>Dose</hi> of <hi>Brow,</hi> as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self commonly calls his own <hi>prime</hi> Accomplishment. For it was such ane Arrant mixture of Flattery and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisy, especially when enlightened by their subsequent practice, that no <hi>Sophistry</hi> can palliate it, so, as to make it seem innocent: But it has been so frequently tossed already that I need not to insist upon it: Far less, am I at leisure to examine all the ridiculous <hi>stuff</hi> our Author has vented about it. Only one thing I shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to the world to be farther consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
            <p>Whoso has Read any of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors <hi>Vindications</hi> of his Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> cannot but have observed that, even to loathsomeness, he was precise in pursuing his Adversaries, foot for foot, on all occasions, when <hi>Impudence</hi> it self could afford him any thing to say: Yet one thing of very great consequence, was alledged by the Author of the <hi>Second Letter,</hi> to which he has Answered nothing. What else could move our Author to this <hi>sinful</hi> and unseasonable <hi>silence,</hi> but
<pb facs="tcp:101025:52"/>
the <hi>Conscience,</hi> that it was not fit to meddle with it?</p>
            <p>The Matter is this:
<q>The Author of that <hi>Letter,</hi> having Discoursed how amazed the Presbyterians themselves were at the <hi>Dispensing Power,</hi> upon the publication of <hi>K. I.</hi>'s first Proclamation for the <hi>Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; How little forward they were, at first, to accept of it; And how they complyed not with its designs, till they got a Second Edition of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
Offered at conjecturing about the Reasons which might have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them, afterwards, to embrace it so thankfully and unanimously as they did. Amongst the rest I find he insisted on <hi>this</hi> as <hi>one,</hi> viz. <hi>That they had got secret instructions from</hi> Holland, <hi>to comply with the Dispensing Power in subserviency to the ensuing Revolution:</hi> And he added, that for this, <hi>he knew there were very strong Presumptions.</hi> Now, <hi>G. R.</hi> I say, passed this over, in a profound silence; which, to me, seems a considerable presumption that there was some truth in the matter, and the <hi>Epistler</hi> had gues<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed right: But if it was so; I think the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
<pb facs="tcp:101025:53"/>
               <hi>Address</hi> to <hi>K. I.</hi> for the <hi>Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> may now appear in blacker co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours than ever.</p>
            <p>I am earnest not to be mistaken: I do not Condemn their keeping a Correspondence with the Court at the <hi>Hague,</hi> on that occasion: Let that have been done dutifully or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutifully, as it might: All I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd for is this, that, If they kept a Correspondence there, at that time; if they got encouragement or Advice, thence, to comply with the Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; If they were instructed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with it in subserviency to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing Revolution; If these things were, I say, then, what a <hi>villany</hi> was it in them to <hi>Address</hi> to <hi>K. I.</hi> in such a manner?</p>
            <p>If they had known nothing of any Designs for setting him beside his Throne; If they had been privy to no intriques against him; If it had been nothing but a <hi>surprize</hi> occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by such ane unexpected Liberty, that prevailed with them to <hi>Address</hi> to him in such Terms, as they did on that occasion; something might have been pleaded to extenuate their guilt,
<pb facs="tcp:101025:53"/>
at least, tho' they had complyed with the Designs of the <hi>Revolution,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when they saw it <hi>prevailing</hi>: Their Ignorance of Intrigues, and the Politick Designs were then on foot; and the possibility of their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been sincere when they <hi>Addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi> so, to him, might have been plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Alleviation of the <hi>Dishonesty</hi> of their not performing what they promised in their <hi>Address</hi>; And it might have passed on with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon croud of infirmities which usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly surprize men of weak resolution in such Critical junctures. But to be on Plots and Intrigues against him; To snatch at his Concessions that they might be in a condition to ruine him; and in the mean time, to make such protestations to him; to flatter and cajole him at such a rate, meerly, of Design to wheedle him into a deep se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, that they might the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditely and effectually supplant and ruine him, was such ane instance of iniquity, of Antichristian craft, of rank and vile cheatry, as can scarcely be parallell'd in History. And so I leave it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:101025:54"/>Thus I have given half a dozen of instances, which might be sufficient, in all reason for exposing our Authors goodly <hi>Impudence</hi>: And yet they may be reckoned amongst the most inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of many scores that might be collected in his writings. But 'tis not my present purpose to pursue him in all his wild careers: I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, insist only on three or four things more, which, as I take it, may be sufficient to give the world a surfeit of him. The things I am to to take notice of, are some <hi>Impudent shifts</hi> he has betaken himself to, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricating himself, when, at any time, <hi>he</hi> or <hi>his Cause</hi> was put to it, by any present difficulty. In such Cases, no Rule obliges him; no Law binds him, no Equity bounds him, no Shame bridles him, no sense of Reputation over-aws him. Thus, <hi>e. g.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Before he shall be forced to yield in his Argument, or seem to be <hi>non-plus't</hi> he shall not fail to <hi>fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bish</hi> his <hi>Talent,</hi> and make it <hi>keen</hi> enough for combating the <hi>Common sense</hi> of the whole Nation: It were ane endless work to trace him thro'
<pb facs="tcp:101025:54"/>
all instances he has of this Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What possessions have any</hi> (of the Episcopal Clergy) <hi>been deprived of, unless for Crimes against the State?</hi> (2 Vind. p. 6.) now, who knows not that more than 300 who were <hi>outed</hi> by the <hi>Rabble,</hi> were <hi>deprived</hi> of their <hi>Possessions,</hi> and that by ane Act of Parliament, without so much as being <hi>Charged</hi> with any <hi>Crime</hi> or <hi>tryed</hi> by any <hi>Court</hi>? Again,</p>
            <p>The Author of the <hi>Second Letter</hi> had called it <hi>K. I.'s Retirement,</hi> when he left <hi>England,</hi> and went to <hi>France: So he Termeth</hi> (says G. R. 2 Vind. p. 23) <hi>that which the Parliament called King</hi> James's abdicating <hi>the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Now his Author was a <hi>Scottish</hi> man, and writing upon <hi>Scottish Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheses,</hi> and about <hi>Scottish</hi> affairs, so that, if <hi>G. R.</hi> spake <hi>sense,</hi> he spake of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Parliament: But I am satisfied, that the world reckon me as <hi>Impudent</hi> as <hi>G. R.</hi> is really, if there is so much as one syllable, or any thing that looks like ane intimation of King <hi>I.</hi>'s either <hi>Abdicating</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting</hi> the Government, in any <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish Declaration,</hi> or <hi>Law,</hi> or <hi>Claim of
<pb facs="tcp:101025:55"/>
Right</hi>; In any <hi>publick Deed</hi> done by the <hi>Nation.</hi> Again</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Vind.</hi> p. 36. He says, <hi>That most of them who were thrust out by the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, were put out by their own Consciences:</hi> But after this, what might he not have said? To trace him thro' all such instances, I say, would be ane endless work: I shall therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine my self to two; One a <hi>Matter</hi> of <hi>Fact:</hi> Another, a <hi>Matter</hi> of <hi>Right</hi>; or rather a <hi>mixt matter,</hi> in which both <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Fact</hi> are concerned.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Matter of Fact,</hi> shall be that story, he so frequently insists on, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout my Lord <hi>Dundee</hi>'s 2000 men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in his <hi>Second Vindication. About the time the Convention of Estates was to sit down, a Design was discovered (framed by the</hi> Viscount <hi>of</hi> Dundee <hi>and others) to surprize and seize the Convention, and for this end had secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly got together of</hi> K. J.<hi>'s disbanded Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and others about</hi> 2000 <hi>strangers in</hi> Edenburgh. (p. 11) This Plot did our Author a great many services: <hi>It occasioned those of the West to gather as many into</hi> Edenburgh <hi>to oppose them and secure the Convention.</hi> (ibid.) Mark
<pb facs="tcp:101025:55"/>
here, they were those of the <hi>West</hi> who <hi>Gathered</hi> the Rabble into <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> and this <hi>Gathering</hi> was only <hi>occasional,</hi> and of their own proper motion; Mark these things, I say, and compare them with what follows. Again,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That there was a Design to fall on the Ministers of</hi> Edenburgh, <hi>is affirmed on no ground, and without any Truth; Or that the</hi> Colledge <hi>of</hi> Justice <hi>Arm'd in their Defence: It was rather on the same Design on which the</hi> Viscount <hi>of</hi> Dundee <hi>had gathered forces into the Town, and it was for opposing of them, and not for Assaulting the Ministers of</hi> Edenburgh. (ibid. 39) And (p. 40) <hi>The thanks the Rabble got was for their zeal in Defending the Convention from that opposite Rabble,</hi> viz. <hi>the</hi> 2000 <hi>men</hi> Dundee <hi>and others had gathered into</hi> Edenburgh, <hi>to have seized the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> Again, (p. 96) <hi>That the</hi> Western Rabble <hi>which came to</hi> Edenburgh <hi>in the time of the Convention were in Arms against Law,</hi> (says he) <hi>is false, for they were called by the Authority of the Estates as their Guard, when their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies had gathered a formidable party
<pb facs="tcp:101025:56"/>
into</hi> Edenburgh. And <hi>tho' they were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether before the</hi> Earl <hi>of</hi> Levin <hi>got the command, yet not before they were called together by the Estates.</hi> (ibid.) And (p. 110) <hi>He</hi> (Dundee) <hi>had gathered a formidable party to destroy the Convention of Estates, and they gathered a force for their own security.</hi> Now,</p>
            <p>One who is a meer stranger to <hi>Scottish</hi> affairs, finding this <hi>Plot</hi> of <hi>Dundee</hi>'s, so confidently asserted, so frequently insisted on, made use of to serve so many turns, would seem to have Reason to believe that there was really such a <hi>Plot,</hi> and that all this was uncontrovertible <hi>Matter of Fact.</hi> For how is it to be imagined that <hi>one</hi> who undertook to be the <hi>Vindicator</hi> of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> should talk so <hi>boldly</hi> of such a <hi>Recent</hi> Matter of Fact, if there was no such thing <hi>really</hi>? And yet,</p>
            <p>The whole Nation knows, this whole Matter is as <hi>Notorious Figment,</hi> as <hi>Arrant Poesie,</hi> as is in all <hi>Homer</hi> or <hi>Ovid</hi>'s <hi>Metamorphosis:</hi> For my part, I never so much as once heard of it, (and I was at <hi>Edenburgh</hi> for the most part, the whole year 1689) till I
<pb facs="tcp:101025:56"/>
found it asserted by <hi>G.R.</hi> in his <hi>Second Vindication, i. e.</hi> toward the end of the year 1691. And let the world judge of its Credibility.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Poets</hi> themselves should be careful to <hi>feign</hi> things <hi>Plausibly:</hi> But it seems our Author has never Read so much as the first ten lines of <hi>Horace, De Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te Poeticâ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Convocation of the Rabble from the <hi>West,</hi> which was at <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> when the Convention of Estates met, would not have amounted to above 6 or 700 men. I saw them actually drawn up between the <hi>Tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>booth</hi> and the <hi>Weigh-house</hi> of <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> upon the 18<hi>th</hi> day of <hi>March</hi> 1689. I am confident they were not 800, yet, tho' they were but a <hi>Rabble, raw</hi> and <hi>untrain'd</hi> men, they chased <hi>Dundee</hi> out of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> tho' he had 2000 <hi>Train'd</hi> and <hi>Disciplin'd</hi> men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his command; and yet the same <hi>Dundee</hi> with scrace 2000 <hi>Vntrain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>You may observe, he says, it was not to Defend the Ministers of <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:101025:57"/>
that the <hi>Colledge</hi> of <hi>Iustice</hi> Arm'd, but in pursuance of that same Design with <hi>Dundee, viz.</hi> the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing and seizing of the Convention. Now, <hi>be it know to all men,</hi> that the Convocation of the Rabble which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned the Arming of the Colledge of Justice was quite different from that Convocation which was made when the Estates met. The <hi>Western</hi> Rabble met first at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> with a Design to have insulted the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of that City, about the 24<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> and their numbers were daily increasing. The Colledge of Justice Arm'd and kept Guard about the 25 or 26<hi>th</hi> of that month. About the middle of <hi>February,</hi> there was a Proclamation over the <hi>Cross</hi> of <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, Commanding all in Arms except the Garrisons,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to Disband.</hi> Upon this, the Colledge of Justice Disarmed immediately. All this while, <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee</hi> was so far from having got to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether 2000 to surprize the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that neither was the Convention so much as indicted (for the Letters by which it was indicted bear date no sooner than <hi>Feb.</hi> 5. at St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s,
<pb facs="tcp:101025:57"/>
and some six or eight or ten days, I think, were gone, before they were delivered to all persons concern'd in <hi>Scotland.</hi>) Nor was <hi>Dundee</hi> as yet come from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Scotland.</hi> Well<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Was not the <hi>Western</hi> Rabble, which was in <hi>Edenburgh</hi> in the time of the Convention, called by the Meeting of Estates for Counterplotting <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee</hi>'s Plot? Pure <hi>Poesie</hi> still! For did not our Author himself say (p. 11) That <hi>Dundee's having got together</hi> 2000 <hi>men,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>occasioned those in the</hi> West <hi>to gather as many into</hi> Edenburgh <hi>to oppose him</hi>? Now if they were only occasionally <hi>Gathered</hi> by those in the <hi>West,</hi> how could they be <hi>called</hi> by the Authority of the <hi>Estates</hi>? Were those in the <hi>West,</hi> who <hi>Gathered</hi> them, the <hi>Estates</hi>? Besides, I would only ask <hi>G. R.</hi> if he can as readily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the <hi>Order</hi> of the Estates for <hi>lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying</hi> these men for Defending the Convention against <hi>Dundee,</hi> as I can produce their <hi>Act</hi> for returning <hi>thanks</hi> to them? Let him search all the Records and try if he can find such ane <hi>Order.</hi> In short,</p>
            <p>Who knows not that that Rabble
<pb facs="tcp:101025:58"/>
was in <hi>Edenburgh</hi> as <hi>early</hi> as the <hi>Estates</hi> themselves? The Estates (as all <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> knows) met on the 14<hi>th</hi> day of <hi>March:</hi> The Rabble threatned <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee</hi> on the 15<hi>th</hi> or 16<hi>th</hi>: He repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented it to the Estates on <hi>Moonday</hi>'s morning, being the 18<hi>th</hi>: He could find no security for his person: He departed therefore from <hi>Edenburgh</hi> with some 28 or 30 persons in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, that same day, and never saw it again. All this was done before <hi>Levin</hi> got his Commission from the <hi>Estates</hi> to <hi>Command</hi> the <hi>Rabble,</hi> or <hi>form</hi> them into <hi>Regular Troops.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,</p>
            <p>Let the world consider if it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not even <hi>Poetick Expedition,</hi> to have got that Rabble <hi>leavied</hi> by <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Meeting</hi> of <hi>Estates.</hi> There could not be ane <hi>Order</hi> of the Estates for <hi>leavying</hi> them, before the Estates met, as I take it: The Estates met on <hi>Thursday</hi> 14<hi>th</hi> afternoon: on <hi>Moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> the 18<hi>th,</hi> These men were in <hi>Rank</hi> and <hi>File,</hi> on the street of <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>: And many, most of them lived at 50, 60, 70, miles distance from the City. This, one would think, was
<pb facs="tcp:101025:58"/>
no ordinary <hi>Expedition.</hi> And now let any man judge if <hi>G. R.</hi> was not inspired with a goodly dose of <hi>Poetick</hi> (<hi>Fire</hi> shall I call it? Or) <hi>Fury,</hi> when he laid this foundation of <hi>Dundee</hi>'s <hi>Plot,</hi> and raised so many pretty structures upon it. And so much, of his modesty in narrating Matter of <hi>meer Fact.</hi> But is he as modest at <hi>mixt Matters</hi> where both <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Fact</hi> are concerned? Consider him but in <hi>one</hi> instance, for brevity.</p>
            <p>The Author of the <hi>Second Letter</hi> had given ane Account of Doctor <hi>Strachan</hi>'s Defence, when he appeared before the Committee of Estates, and was Challenged for not praying for <hi>W.</hi> and <hi>M.</hi> as <hi>K.</hi> and <hi>Q.</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> &amp;c. This, for substance: <hi>That the Estates had found in their</hi> Claim of Right, <hi>that none could be</hi> K. <hi>and</hi> Q. <hi>of</hi> Scotland <hi>till they had sworn the</hi> Coronation Oath: <hi>For this Reason, they had Declared that</hi> James <hi>by Assuming the Regal Power, and Acting as</hi> King, <hi>without having taken the</hi> Oath <hi>required by</hi> Law — <hi>had forfeited the</hi> Right <hi>to the</hi> Crown: <hi>That all the Estates had yet done, was only the Nomination of</hi> W. <hi>and</hi> M. <hi>as the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<pb facs="tcp:101025:59"/>
to whom the</hi> Crown <hi>should be</hi> offered; <hi>But they had not yet actually made the</hi> offer: <hi>Far less had</hi> W. <hi>and</hi> M. <hi>accepted of it: It was possible they might refuse it: But tho' they should not, yet, they could not be</hi> K. <hi>and</hi> Q. <hi>of</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>till they had solemnly sworn the</hi> Oath. <hi>This was not yet done: And therefore he could not see how he could Pray for them as</hi> K. <hi>and</hi> Q. <hi>of</hi> Scotland, <hi>nor how the</hi> Estates, <hi>in Reason, or in Consequence to their own principles could require it of him.</hi> One would think there was some force in this Defence. Yet,</p>
            <p>Our Author had such a <hi>Force</hi> of <hi>Impudence</hi> as prompted him to offer at confuting it. But how? <hi>It is known</hi> (says he) <hi>that the Exercise of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment had been, long before, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to the</hi> Prince, <hi>and that his</hi> High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness <hi>had Accepted and Exercised it.</hi> True; It was tendered to him on the <hi>tenth</hi> of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 168<hi rend="sup">8</hi>, and he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of it upon the 14<hi>th.</hi> But what was this to <hi>M.</hi>? Was the Exercise of the Government Tendered to <hi>Her</hi> also? Or did this <hi>Tender</hi> made to <hi>W.</hi> and his Accepting of it make him
<pb facs="tcp:101025:59"/>
               <hi>King</hi>? Was he <hi>King</hi> ever after the 14<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Ianuary</hi>?</p>
            <p>Observe here, by the way, when our Author had the Rabble to Defend, and the Estates to justify for not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing the Rabbled Ministers (and the Nation knows, hundreds were Rabbled after that 14<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Ianuary</hi>) He could tell it twenty times over that that was ane <hi>Interregnum, a State of Anarchy,</hi> &amp;c. So that, if I mistake not, it may try his <hi>Reconciling Skill</hi> to make what he says here, and what he said on these occasions, piece well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Proceed we now to what he has said more about <hi>Strachan</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Nations Representative</hi> (says he) <hi>had then own'd him</hi> (W.) <hi>as their King; and therefore it was a contempt of the Authority of the Nation for any man to refuse to own him, when called to do so.</hi> Now, what could move our Author to such a <hi>stretch</hi> of his <hi>main Talent,</hi> as thus to say that the Representative of the Nation had owned him as their <hi>King</hi>? I confess I am not able to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom. For, how could they own him as <hi>King</hi> so long as he had not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb facs="tcp:101025:60"/>
the <hi>Oath,</hi> nor Agreed to the <hi>Claim of Right</hi>? If they own'd him as <hi>King</hi> before that, was he not <hi>King</hi> before that? But if he was <hi>King</hi> before that, where is the <hi>use</hi> of the <hi>Oath,</hi> or the <hi>Claim of Right</hi>?</p>
            <p>The Estates, indeed, upon the 11<hi>th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> Declared <hi>W.</hi> and <hi>M.</hi> to be the Persons to whom they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to <hi>Offer</hi> the <hi>Crown,</hi> upon such and such <hi>Conditions,</hi> as is evident from that day's <hi>Proclamation</hi>: But the <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>et<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of the <hi>Estates</hi> by which they actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally made the <hi>Offer</hi> of the <hi>Crown,</hi> on these <hi>Conditions,</hi> was not written till <hi>April</hi> 24. and the return, bearing that <hi>They</hi> had <hi>Accepted</hi> of the <hi>Crown,</hi> on these <hi>Conditions,</hi> is <hi>dated May</hi> 17. And was not Doctor <hi>Strachan</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived, even before the Letter of the Estates was sent to <hi>London</hi>? Were not more than 24 Ministers Deprived before their Majesties return came to <hi>Edenburgh</hi>? Besides,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>G. R.</hi>'s <hi>Impudence,</hi> as <hi>sturdy</hi> as it is, did not serve him, it seems, to give a faithful Account of D. <hi>Strachan</hi>'s <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,</hi> and grapple with all the force of it: For the Doctor (if the Author
<pb facs="tcp:101025:60"/>
of the <hi>Second Letter</hi> was right) made the supposition, that <hi>W.</hi> and <hi>M.</hi> might refuse to take the Crown with such Conditions: This was so far from being ane Impossible, that it was truly a very Reasonable, a very Equitable, a very Dutiful supposition: Now, suppose they had done so, would they have been <hi>K.</hi> and <hi>Q.</hi> for all that, by vertue of the Declaration of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states of the 11<hi>th</hi> of <hi>April</hi>? If so, I ask again, what the <hi>Coronation Oath,</hi> or the <hi>Claim of Right</hi> signified? Or were the Estates to make them <hi>K.</hi> and <hi>Q.</hi> whither they would or not? If, upon that supposition, they had not been <hi>K.</hi> and <hi>Q.</hi> (as, undoubtedly, they had not been) then, what can be more evident than that the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation</hi> of the 11<hi>th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> did no more than <hi>Nominate</hi> them to be <hi>K.</hi> and <hi>Q.</hi> upon their <hi>Agreeing</hi> to such <hi>Conditions</hi>? So that <hi>G. R.</hi> was even himself, when he said that the Nations <hi>Representative</hi> had <hi>own'd</hi> them as <hi>K.</hi> and <hi>Q.</hi> before the 13<hi>th</hi> of <hi>April.</hi> I add further,</p>
            <p>What tho' they had <hi>own'd</hi> them as <hi>K.</hi> and <hi>Q.</hi> by their <hi>Proclamation</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:101025:61"/>
the 11<hi>th</hi> of <hi>April</hi>? Did not the whole <hi>Drift,</hi> the whole <hi>Design,</hi> the whole <hi>Train,</hi> the whole <hi>Tendency,</hi> the whole <hi>Aspect,</hi> and the whole <hi>Circumstances</hi> of the <hi>Deliberations, Resolutions</hi> and <hi>Conclusions</hi> of the <hi>Estates</hi> evidently propose it to the dullest apprehension, that the <hi>Crown</hi> was not to be granted to them, but on such and such <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi>? This Question I propose, for vindicating D. <hi>Strachan</hi> from the guilt of <hi>Contempt</hi> of the <hi>Authority</hi> of the Estates, with which <hi>G. R.</hi> charges him: For if the affirmative in the Question be <hi>true,</hi> (and, I think, <hi>G. R.</hi> himself dares not to say, 'tis <hi>false</hi>) then, I ask how it could be called a <hi>Contempt</hi> of the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to have refused, then, to <hi>own W.</hi> and <hi>M.</hi> as <hi>K.</hi> and <hi>Q.</hi>? How can he be said to <hi>Contemn</hi> the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Nation,</hi> who <hi>Reasons</hi> upon the <hi>Nations Authority</hi>? Who <hi>Reasons</hi> upon the <hi>Force</hi> of all the <hi>Deliberations, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions</hi> and <hi>Conclusions</hi> of the <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative Body</hi> of the <hi>Nation</hi>? If do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so, he doth yet <hi>Contemn</hi> the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> of the <hi>Nation,</hi> I am apt to think, it cannot be his <hi>Fault:</hi> He <hi>doth</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:101025:61"/>
but what a man must <hi>needs do,</hi> when the <hi>Nation</hi> makes <hi>Repugnant</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory Determinations.</hi> But after all this, is it not pleasant that <hi>G. R.</hi> forsooth, should so zealously exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the <hi>Crime</hi> of <hi>Contemning</hi> the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> of the <hi>Nation</hi>? Good Man! He paid it a wonderful <hi>Dutifulness</hi> all his life: Far was it still from him to treat it with such <hi>Contempt</hi> as Dr. <hi>Strachan</hi>'s amounted to. But he has not yet done.</p>
            <p>He Answers further, that it is a <hi>Material mistake of the words of the Claim of Right:</hi> (that was alledged in <hi>Strachan</hi>'s Defence) <hi>which doth not say, none can be King or Queen,</hi> but that <hi>none can exercise the Regal Power till they have taken the Coronation Oath: It is certain that on the death of a King, his Rightful Successor is King; and may be prayed for as such; and such praying may be injoined even before taking of the Oath: The same may be said of</hi> one Chosen, <hi>and Proclaim'd by the Supreme Authority of the Nation, which is the Case now in hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is a piece of as <hi>odd stuff</hi> as one would wish to see: For, if it was a
<pb facs="tcp:101025:62"/>
               <hi>Material mistake</hi> to say, <hi>none can be King or Queen,</hi> when it should have been said, <hi>none can exercise the Regal Power,</hi> it seems to me to have been a <hi>mistake</hi> made of very <hi>Mathematical Matter,</hi> not of the solid <hi>sensible Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> which can be <hi>felt</hi> and <hi>handled:</hi> For my part I cannot forbear think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it must be compounded of <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Quantities,</hi> till I shall learn how one can be a <hi>King,</hi> (i. e. <hi>a Person who has Right to Rule and Act as King</hi>) who has, yet, <hi>no Right to exercise the Regal Power, or Act as King.</hi> I know, one may be <hi>Physically</hi> incapable of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising</hi> the <hi>Regal Power,</hi> and <hi>Acting</hi> as <hi>King,</hi> by himself, in several Cases, such as that of <hi>Infancy,</hi> &amp;c. yet even then, he has <hi>Right</hi> which is not a <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical</hi> but a <hi>Moral</hi> Quality. Now, I say, I would fain understand how <hi>one</hi> can be a <hi>King,</hi> without this <hi>Moral Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>; or how he can have this <hi>Moral Quality,</hi> called <hi>Right,</hi> and yet be <hi>Morally</hi> incapable of <hi>exercising</hi> it. I shall own <hi>G. R.</hi> is good at <hi>Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicks,</hi> if he can give ane Intelligible Account of these things. Well!</p>
            <p>But it is certain, <hi>that on the death
<pb facs="tcp:101025:62"/>
of a King, his Rightful Successor is King, and may be Prayed for, as such, and such Praying may be injoyned even before taking of the Oath:</hi> All this is true; But then I affirm it is as true that that <hi>Rightful Successor</hi> who is <hi>King,</hi> may and can <hi>exercise</hi> the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Power</hi> and <hi>Act</hi> as <hi>King,</hi> before he takes the <hi>Oath.</hi> So, I am sure, our <hi>Scottish</hi> Monarchs have <hi>done:</hi> So the <hi>Law</hi> allows them to <hi>do,</hi> so, of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they <hi>must do.</hi> For instance, they are not bound, by Law to take the <hi>Oath</hi> but at their <hi>Coronation</hi>: And (not to speak of other things) I think it is truly ane <hi>exercising</hi> of their <hi>Regal Power,</hi> and <hi>Acting</hi> as <hi>Kings</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the preparations <hi>for,</hi> the day, the place, the solemnities, <hi>&amp;c. of</hi> their own Coronations: For, I think, none other can do it but <hi>the King,</hi> and, if so, he must do it <hi>as King,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, <hi>another</hi> might do it. But then,</p>
            <p>Tho' I have granted our Author this much, that the <hi>Rightful Successor</hi> is <hi>King</hi> before he takes the <hi>Oath,</hi> I think no Reason can oblige me to grant what followeth, <hi>viz. That the same may be said of</hi> ONE CHOSEN,
<pb facs="tcp:101025:63"/>
               <hi>and Proclaimed by the Supreme Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Nation, which is the</hi> CASE NOW IN HAND. For, (not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist on the Liberty our Author hath taken here, to call their Majesties <hi>Elective Soveraigns,</hi> in opposition to such as are <hi>Hereditary,</hi> tho', I think, it was pretty bold in him to talk so) I think this is one of the most nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble differences, between ane <hi>Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> and ane <hi>Elective</hi> Monarchy, that in the <hi>Hereditary, the King never dies, i. e.</hi> In that same instant that the Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Kings breath goeth out, the Rightful Successor is King: Whereas in the <hi>Elective</hi> Monarchy the <hi>King dies</hi> with the <hi>Man,</hi> and there is no <hi>King</hi> till there is a <hi>New Creation.</hi> This, I think, makes the Cases pretty wide: And, I think, they are <hi>wider,</hi> yet when he that is to be the <hi>Elected King,</hi> is not to be <hi>King</hi> at all, till he Agrees to such and such <hi>Conditions:</hi> Who sees not a vast difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Hereditary</hi> and the <hi>Elective</hi> King in this Case? But not to press our Author farther, and once for all to end this Controversie about <hi>Strach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>'s Defence, take what follows for undoubted Truth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:101025:63"/>Upon that same very <hi>eleventh</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 1689, on which the <hi>Estates</hi> gave out their <hi>Proclamation,</hi> importing that they had <hi>Resolved</hi> that <hi>W.</hi> and <hi>M.</hi> should be <hi>K.</hi> and <hi>Q.</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> they enacted their <hi>Declaration</hi> containing the <hi>Claim of Right,</hi> and their <hi>Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to <hi>Offer</hi> the <hi>Crown</hi> only on the <hi>Terms</hi> of that <hi>Claim</hi>; and not only so, but they made this following <hi>Act,</hi> word for word.</p>

            <p>If this Act doth not make it evident that there was no <hi>Material Mistake</hi> of the words of the <hi>Claim of Right,</hi> in Dr. <hi>Strachan</hi>'s <hi>Defence</hi>; But that the <hi>Doctor pleaded</hi> and <hi>Reason'd</hi> upon the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest Principles</hi> of the <hi>Meeting</hi> of <hi>Estates:</hi> If it doth not Demonstrate that the Doctors <hi>Plea</hi> was Solid and Irrefra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable; and if it follows not by neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary consequence, that it was ane un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accoutable proceeding of the <hi>Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee</hi> of <hi>Estates</hi> to deprive the <hi>Doctor,</hi> and near to <hi>thirty</hi> more, for not <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> for <hi>W.</hi> and <hi>M.</hi> as <hi>K.</hi> and <hi>Q.</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> before they <hi>were,</hi> or <hi>could be</hi> K and Q. of <hi>Scotland,</hi> let the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Reader judge. But if these infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences are notoriously just, then let him judge again, if <hi>G. R.</hi> by offering to invalidate the Dr.<hi>'s Defence,</hi> was not guilty of a palpable indiscretion, in refreshing the memory of such an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable proceeding of the <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of the <hi>Committee</hi> of Estates, which had been far better buried in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb facs="tcp:101025:64"/>
oblivion, and lastly let him judge, if it argued not more than ane <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Impudence</hi> in <hi>G. R.</hi> to have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted the <hi>Defence</hi> of that Proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure; And if such ane attempt was not, with a <hi>Fetch</hi> of his <hi>Talent,</hi> pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to himself, to offer <hi>violence</hi> to <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Law,</hi> to <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> to the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and the <hi>Common sense</hi> of <hi>Mankind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One would think, 'twas <hi>Impudence</hi> enough in all Conscience, to have made so bold with common Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and particularly, with the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Convictions of ones Native Country, as to a plain Matter of Fact: But such is our Authors share of that <hi>Daring Talent,</hi> that assisted by it, he could even flee in the face of his <hi>Dearer Relations,</hi> and leave them in the <hi>Lurch,</hi> rather than appear to have been worsted in his Argument: Thus, <hi>e. g.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. When he was put to it, and could not, otherwise, make his escape, he never made scruple to flee in the face of the present Civil Government.</p>
            <p>He tells you, indeed, in his <hi>Preface</hi> to 2 <hi>Vind.</hi> §. 6. That one of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
<pb facs="tcp:101025:65"/>
in writing his Book was to Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate and Justify the Actings of the Civil Government. Believe him, on many occasions, and he is a most du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Subject; there cannot be a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Reverencer of Authority; He tells you, <hi>'Tis a sawcy boldness for private persons to meddle with the Designs of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislators.</hi> (2 Vind. p. 112) And God knows how frequently he exposes his Adversaries to the Resentments of the Civil Government: How zealous is he for <hi>stretching necks,</hi> &amp;c.? And yet, for all this, as much as he is obliged to it, as great a veneration as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends for it, it must not only shift for it self, but he must run through its sides, if he has not another <hi>hole</hi> to escape by. I shall only take notice of two instances of his behaviour this way.</p>
            <p>The <hi>first</hi> is in his 2 <hi>Vind.</hi> (p. 22) His Adversary had <hi>laught</hi> at the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Address,</hi> and their protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Loyalty</hi> to K J. <hi>But I would fain know</hi> (says G. R.) <hi>by what Topick either of these can be Condemned.</hi> I think, I have hinted, at least, at <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick</hi> enough about that: Go we on,
<pb facs="tcp:101025:65"/>
now, with our Author: <hi>They gave thanks for restoring them to their just Right:</hi> Neither is this the Matter: <hi>They Professed and practised Loyalty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their</hi> LAWFUL <hi>Soveraign, tho' of a different Religion from them.</hi> Here it is. For don't you hear him plainly affirming, that <hi>K. I.</hi> was a LAW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FUL SOVERAIGN? Now what was this less than striking at the very root of the present Establishment? Is it not a direct Contradicting of the <hi>Claim of Right,</hi> which <hi>Declares</hi> that K. J. <hi>had forfeited the Right to the Crown by assuming the Regal Power, and Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as King, without ever taking the Oath required by Law? i. e.</hi> Manifestly, for not being a LAWFUL SOVE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAIGN. If thus to Contradict its very foundation, strikes not at the root of the present Constitution, let the world judge. But so it was, that our Author could not otherwise justify the Presbyterian <hi>Address,</hi> &amp;c. Again,</p>
            <p>
               <q>One of his Adversaries had Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued, that Episcopacy was abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Parliament as being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the <hi>Inclinations of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> and therefore, if the People
<pb facs="tcp:101025:66"/>
should <hi>alter their Inclinations,</hi> it might be <hi>restored</hi> by another Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</q>
            </p>
            <p>One would think there was Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son here; and it seems <hi>G. R.</hi> was sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of it: And therefore finding no other way to avoid its <hi>Dint,</hi> he straight <hi>impugns</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament.</hi> Take his own words (2 <hi>Vind</hi> p. 90) <hi>But he should have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered</hi> (says he) <hi>that whatever Motive the Estates went upon, it is Declared against in the Claim of Right as a Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, and therefore, cannot be restored without overturning the Foundation of our present Civil settlement.</hi> He is at this, again, in other places, upon the like occasions, particularly p. 152. Now,</p>
            <p>Not to insist on the <hi>Irreligion</hi> and <hi>Godlessness</hi> of that wild fetch, <hi>viz.</hi> That whatsoever the Motives were which induced men to Establish any thing, yet being once Establish't it cannot be altered;</p>
            <p>Not to insist on the notorious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonableness of separating the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion</hi> of the Estates from their <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses,</hi> and saying the <hi>Conclusion</hi> must stand tho' the <hi>Premisses</hi> be rejected,
<pb facs="tcp:101025:66"/>
tho' they Established the <hi>Conclusion</hi> on the strength they apprehended was in the <hi>Premisses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not to insist on the the Ridiculous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of saying, that Episcopacy cannot be restored without overturning the <hi>Foundation</hi> of the <hi>present civil Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>: Tho nothing can be <hi>more</hi> Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous than to say that the <hi>founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of the <hi>present civil Settlement</hi> are Subverted, if all <hi>Ecclesiastical Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> are not Redressed.</p>
            <p>Not to insist that our Author spake very much at Random when he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Abolition</hi> of Episcopacy, one of the <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of the present <hi>Civil</hi> Settlement, considering that the present <hi>Civil</hi> Settlement was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Founded,</hi> but <hi>Finished,</hi> a good time before the <hi>Abolition</hi> of Episcopacy: Not to insist on these things, I say, However Momentous.</p>
            <p>Consider, only, how directly and plainly he <hi>Impugns</hi> the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> by saying, <hi>They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Restore Episcopacy without Subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Foundations of the present ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Settlement.</hi> What is this less than that, if <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> should
<pb facs="tcp:101025:67"/>
               <hi>Restore</hi> Episcopacy, they should <hi>break</hi> their <hi>Original contracts</hi>? Than that <hi>both</hi> should <hi>forfeit</hi> their Titles? Than that the <hi>King</hi> should be <hi>no more King,</hi> and the <hi>Parliament</hi> should be <hi>no more Parliament</hi>?</p>
            <p>Is it not clear that, with our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, the <hi>Articles</hi> of our present <hi>Claim of Right</hi> are <hi>unalterable</hi>? Unchangeable <hi>Rules</hi> both to <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi>? Now if this is not to <hi>impugn</hi> their <hi>power,</hi> I know not what can be. In ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it is to <hi>Evacuate</hi> the <hi>usefulness</hi> of all <hi>Soveraign power</hi>: For where lyeth its <hi>usefulness,</hi> if it is not able to <hi>recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy</hi> what is <hi>amiss,</hi> even in the <hi>Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>? But how can it <hi>rectify</hi> what is <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss,</hi> in the <hi>Constitution,</hi> if the <hi>Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,</hi> Right or Wrong, is <hi>unalterable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For my part, I cannot see but there <hi>is</hi> still that <hi>Supreme power</hi> in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which <hi>was,</hi> when the present <hi>civil</hi> Settlement was made: And as it <hi>might,</hi> while it was a <hi>making</hi> Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, have <hi>made</hi> either <hi>another,</hi> or the <hi>same,</hi> with twenty little varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, so, it may still <hi>alter</hi> that which is made. I cannot think that it either Disabled or Exhausted it self, so, as
<pb facs="tcp:101025:67"/>
to be no more capable of providing <hi>farther,</hi> or <hi>otherwise,</hi> for the <hi>Good</hi> of the <hi>Nation,</hi> when it shall find it <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In short, Is not that same <hi>power</hi> still in the Nation which established the <hi>Claim of Right</hi>? if it is not, what is become of it? How can the Nation subsist without a <hi>Supra-Legal, Supra-Original-Contract, Supra-claim of Right Power</hi>? It had it once, otherwise how could it ever have had <hi>Laws,</hi> or <hi>Claims of Right,</hi> or <hi>Original Contracts</hi>? And must it not have it still? Has it lost it? Or thrown it away? Or has any body taken it from it? But if it is still to the fore; If the Nation is still possessed of it; where is it <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>odg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> if it is not <hi>Lodged</hi> in <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi>?</p>
            <p>Was there more <hi>power</hi> in the <hi>meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of <hi>Estates</hi> than there is, now, in <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi>? How came the <hi>meeting</hi> of <hi>Estates</hi> by it, then? Or whether is it <hi>vanished</hi> now? What is become of it? Especially,</p>
            <p>I think, 'Twas pretty bold to say that the <hi>same power</hi> is not in the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent King</hi> and the <hi>present Parliament</hi>;
<pb facs="tcp:101025:68"/>
Considering that the <hi>present Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is that same very individual thing with the <hi>meeting</hi> of <hi>Estates</hi> by which the <hi>claim of Right</hi> was <hi>Created.</hi> Cannot the same, the very same <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators</hi> pretend to a <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Altering</hi> their own <hi>ill-made Creature,</hi> and <hi>make</hi> it <hi>Better</hi>? Had they more <hi>power</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>One name</hi> than under <hi>Another</hi>? Or have they <hi>weakened</hi> or <hi>lost</hi> their <hi>power</hi> by <hi>communicating</hi> it to their <hi>King,</hi> so that there is not so much <hi>power, Now,</hi> in <hi>him,</hi> and <hi>them</hi> both together, as there was <hi>once</hi> in <hi>them</hi> Singly?</p>
            <p>And now let the Reader Judge if <hi>G. R.</hi> for avoiding a difficulty, has not impudently run himself into the Guilt of the most Atrocious, the most Criminal, the most <hi>Treasonable Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>; The Treason of <hi>impugning</hi> the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament.</hi> This was odd enough, for one in his cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances: But yet the next step seems to me a little more Surprizing: For.</p>
            <p n="9">9 On several occasions, he has not stood on disgracing his own dear party, the Presbyterians themselves,
<pb facs="tcp:101025:68"/>
and most undutifully, as well as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently, discovering their Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. I shall not insist on all instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that might be adduced to this purpose, particularly his Loading the <hi>Cameronians</hi> with so much Guilt and so many hard Names, upon every turn: The <hi>Cameronians,</hi> I say, these Men of <hi>plain</hi> principles, these a vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Covenanters,</hi> these most Orthodox and Honest Presbyterians in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; even them tho they are the true Champions of the <hi>Cause,</hi> and were the principal promoters of the Presbyterian interest in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the late Revolution, he has Lasht to purpose, when his Argument requir'd it; as may be seen in every <hi>page</hi> almost of his <hi>Second vindication.</hi> But this I shall not insist on, I say, leaving him and them to reckon for it, if they shall think it fit.</p>
            <p>I shall take notice only of one ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tender <hi>Secret</hi> of his own <hi>Anoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Species</hi> of pretended Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans which he has even <hi>needlessly,</hi> and by consequence, very <hi>foolishly</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutifully</hi> exposed. He has, in his Books, made many more inexcusable <hi>off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Lies,</hi> than if he had made <hi>One</hi> for covering such a Mighty <hi>Shame</hi> of theirs: But 'tis hard for one of his prudence to avoid such escapes, when pressed with a pungent Argument. The matter is this.</p>
            <p>The Author of the <hi>Case of the afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Clergy</hi> had said, that the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Ministers, never preached a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the disorders of the Rabble: Now hear G. R. (2 vind. p. 97.) <hi>This is False, tho we thought not sit to make that our constant Theme.</hi> Now, that <hi>Rabbling work</hi> was such a <hi>Barbarous</hi> and <hi>Vnchristian work,</hi> that one would think, it had not misbecome the Presbyterian Ministers themselves to have made it, at least, <hi>very much</hi> their <hi>Theme</hi> on that occasion. But the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret</hi> is not here.</p>
            <p>He adds, <hi>And if but few did it; It was because they, who were the Actors in that</hi> Scene, <hi>little Regarded the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Sober Presbyterians:</hi> A great many things may be observed here: For besides that he owns they were but <hi>few</hi> who <hi>prea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hed</hi> against the <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,</hi> It might be of use to enquire at our Author, what kind of <hi>Scene</hi> he
<pb facs="tcp:101025:69"/>
took it to be? Whither was it <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical</hi> or <hi>Comical</hi>? or <hi>Both? Tragical</hi> to the <hi>Prelatists,</hi> and <hi>Comical</hi> to the <hi>Presbyterians</hi>? It were worth enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring likewise, whom he meant, by <hi>Sober Presbyterian Preachers</hi>? If there are any such in the Nation? How many? Where do they preach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I insist not on these things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>Secret</hi> is not amongst them. Yet</p>
            <p>The next thing he produces is worth the Noticing. <hi>And they</hi> (The Sober Presbyterian Preachers, if they had preached against Rabbling the Clergy) <hi>Should have lost their SWEET WORDS.</hi> Now, here is subject af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded for several weighty Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies: For it may be made a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, Whither it be the duty of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Presbyterian Preachers</hi> to <hi>preach</hi> Righteousness <hi>to a Rebellious people, whither they will Hear, or whither they will Forbear</hi>? It may be made ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Whither our Author, here, gave up all the <hi>Rabblers</hi> to a <hi>reprobate Sense</hi>? 'Tis possible he meant so. For the <hi>Sweetest words,</hi> the <hi>Soberest</hi> Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians can utter in their <hi>preachings</hi> are
<pb facs="tcp:101025:70"/>
not too precious to be spent on such as are in a state of <hi>Reclaimableness.</hi> But that which I take to be the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Question, the Question that ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth most naturally from the <hi>Text,</hi> is, Whither Presbyterian <hi>Words</hi> are not <hi>Sweeteer</hi> than that they should be <hi>Spent</hi> on such <hi>needless</hi> purposes, as the Recommendation and Assertion of <hi>Righteousness,</hi> and the Condemnation of <hi>Iniquity</hi>? Whither it had not been ane unaccountable <hi>prodigality</hi> in them to have <hi>lost their Sweet words,</hi> about such <hi>Trif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing</hi> concerns as these? But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the <hi>Secret</hi> here: But it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows now.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>These practices of the Rabble were publickly spoken against by Ministers, both before they were Acted, for prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and after, for Reproving them, and preventing the like.</hi> Here it is, I say: Has he not, here, disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered ane important <hi>Secret</hi> of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Has he not discovered that the <hi>Rabbling</hi> of the Clergy was not the product of Chance or Accident, but a Deliberated, a Consulted, ane Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised politick? Has he not discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that even the sober Presbyterian
<pb facs="tcp:101025:70"/>
Ministers were privy to the plot of it? Has he not told, that <hi>they spake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, before it was Acted, for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting it</hi>? And doth it not follow clearly that they <hi>knew</hi> of it <hi>before</hi> it was <hi>Acted:</hi> for if they had <hi>known</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it, how could they have <hi>spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi> against it for <hi>preventing</hi> it?</p>
            <p>But tho they knew of it, that it was to be done, yet, it seems, They <hi>Consented</hi> not that it should be <hi>Done</hi>; For <hi>they spake against it for preventing of it.</hi> But I am afraid our Author, here, turn'd <hi>weary</hi> of his <hi>Sincerity:</hi> For who spake publickly against these <hi>practices</hi> of the <hi>Rabble</hi>? Or <hi>where,</hi> or <hi>when</hi> were they spoken against, <hi>before they were acted</hi>? I dare challenge him to name one of his most sober Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Ministers who preached <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly</hi> against them <hi>for preventing of them.</hi> When I am put to it I can name more than One or Two, who pretend to be of the <hi>First Rank</hi> of the <hi>Sober Presbyterian</hi> Ministers, who knew of them indeed, and Consulted <hi>private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> about them; and said, <hi>It was the surest way, to have the Curates once dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possessed:</hi> Because, <hi>Once dispossessed,
<pb facs="tcp:101025:71"/>
they might find difficulties in being Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possessed:</hi> But I never heard of so much as <hi>One</hi> who preached against them before they were <hi>Done.</hi> I am very confident <hi>G. R.</hi> cannot name <hi>One.</hi> Indeed,</p>
            <p>Seeing, as our Author Grants, they knew of the Rabbling <hi>before it was Acted</hi>; If they had been so serious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, as they should have been, and as our Author would have us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they were; how natural and easy, as well as Christian and Dutiful had it been, to have given Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisements to the poor men who were to suffer it, about it? Was ever any such thing done? But it seems Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian <hi>words</hi> were <hi>Sweeter</hi> to Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian palates than <hi>Common huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> or <hi>Christian Charity</hi>: They were too <hi>Sweet</hi> to be <hi>Lost</hi> in such <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisements.</hi> By this time, the Reader, I think, has got a proof of <hi>G. R.</hi>'s tenderness, even, to his own <hi>Herd,</hi> when the Argument of ane Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pinched him. But this is not the Highest stept. For</p>
            <p n="10">10. If ane Argument straitens him, He never stands to baffle, and expose,
<pb facs="tcp:101025:71"/>
and contradict and make a Lier of his <hi>own</hi> Learned, Sensible, Civil Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest <hi>Self.</hi> And, here, again, One might write a large volume, but I shall confine my self to a Competent number of instances.</p>
            <p>First, then, you never saw a <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latist</hi> and a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one Another, in more plain, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite and peremptory Terms, than he has done himself on several occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. Take this Taste</p>
            <p>In his <hi>Answer</hi> to D. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s <hi>Irenicum</hi> (p. 64) He is at great pains to prove that where <hi>Episcopacy</hi> is, <hi>Presbyters</hi> have no <hi>power</hi>: Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, he has these two profound Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments for it. 1. <hi>If Bishops be set over Presbyter, they must either be only</hi> Praesides, <hi>which is not contrary to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; or they must have Authority above, and over their Brethren: And if so, They may rule without their Brethren; Seeing they may command them,</hi> &amp;c. 2. <hi>If Presbyters under a Bishop have ruling power, either they may Determine without, or against his consent, or not: if so, The</hi> Bishop <hi>is but</hi> a President: <hi>If not, The</hi> Presbyters <hi>are but</hi> Cyphers.
<pb facs="tcp:101025:72"/>
Now who would think that one of <hi>G. R.</hi>'s Courage would ever have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with such ane important propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, especially, having such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable Arguments for it? Yet.</p>
            <p>Consider if he has not done it, most notoriously in his Answer to the Doctors <hi>Vnreasonableness of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>pag.</hi> 182. where he has these express words. <hi>He</hi> (The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor) <hi>Vndertaketh to prove that the English Episcopacy doth not take away the whole power of Presbyters — we do not alledge that it taketh away the whole power of Presbyters, for that were to reduce them into the same order with the rest of the people; but wee say it usurpeth ane undue power over them,</hi> &amp;c. Again,</p>
            <p>In his <hi>First Vind.</hi> of <hi>his</hi> Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> His <hi>cause</hi> led him, in <hi>Answ.</hi> to <hi>Quest.</hi> 10. to say <hi>That K. Is. Tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration was against Law:</hi> He was pressed with this Argument about the <hi>Inclinations of the people,</hi>
               <q>That not fifty Gentlemen, in all <hi>Scotland</hi> (out of the <hi>West</hi> did, upon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, forsake the <hi>Churches</hi> to frequent <hi>Meeting houses</hi>: And his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer

was.</q>
               <hi>They clave to the former way</hi> (i. e. Continued in the Episcopal Communion) <hi>Because the Law stood for it.</hi> Is it not plain, here, that the <hi>Meeting houses</hi> were <hi>contrary</hi> to <hi>Law</hi>? Hear him, now, in his 2 <hi>vind.</hi> (p. 43, 44. <hi>passim</hi>) when he was prest with the Scandal of his party's Complying with the dispensing <hi>power,</hi> and erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Meeting houses <hi>contrary to Law.</hi> He affirmed boldly, that the <hi>Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing power</hi> was <hi>according to Law,</hi> And <hi>K. I. was enabled by Law, to Grant his Toleration.</hi> Again,</p>
            <p>In his 2. <hi>vind.</hi> in <hi>Answ.</hi> to <hi>Letter</hi> 1. § 9. p. 12. when he had the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Estates to Apologize for, for suffering and allowing persons to sit as Members, who <hi>were not Qualified according to Law.</hi> He Granted some such Members sate there, but <hi>they had been most unjustly Forfeited in the Late Reign.</hi> Even <hi>Parliamentary</hi> Forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, you see were most <hi>Vnjust</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitures, and there was no Reason that they should <hi>exclude</hi> these Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen from their <hi>Iust</hi> and <hi>Antient</hi> Rights and Priviledges. But when he was pressed by the Author of the
<pb facs="tcp:101025:73"/>
               <hi>Case of the Afflicted Clergy,</hi> &amp;c. with this
<q>That many Ministers Benefices were unjustly and illegally kept from them; he got his <hi>Cloak on the other Shoulder,</hi> as we say, <hi>if the Authority of the Nation in the convention or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament have Determined otherwise, I know not where their Legal Right can be founded.</hi>
               </q>
(p. 96. § 6.) It was not so much as <hi>Knowable,</hi> to our Author, in that Case, that there might be <hi>most Vnjust Parliamentary</hi> Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>It were ane endless work to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce all such little <hi>Squabbles</hi> as these, between himself and himself: I shall Insist, therefore, only on <hi>two</hi> more, which are a little more Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And</p>
            <p>First, Our Author was not at more pains about any one thing in his Answ. to D. <hi>Still.</hi>'s <hi>Irenicum,</hi> than the <hi>Insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rableness</hi> that is between the <hi>Teaching</hi> and <hi>Ruling power</hi> of <hi>Presbyters</hi>: He spent no less than 8 or 9 pages about it, Stretching his Invention to find Arguments for it: Whoso pleases to turn to <hi>page</hi> 79 may see the whole Deduction</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:101025:73"/>He is as earnest about it in his <hi>True Representation, &amp;c.</hi> These are his words (<hi>prop.</hi> 13) <hi>There being no Dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of power amongst Ministers by Christs Grant of power to them; No man can make this Disparity by setting one over the rest: Neither can they Devolve their power on one of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: For Christ hath given no such warrant to men to dispose of his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, as they see fit: And power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Delegated to them by him, They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not so commit it to Another to Exercise it for them, as to deprive themselves of it. Also, it being not a</hi> Licence <hi>only, But a</hi> Trust, <hi>of which they must give ane account, They must perform the work by themselves as they will be An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable.</hi> Now, it is not possible for one to contradict himself more than he hath done both <hi>Indirectly</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly</hi> in this matter.</p>
            <p>He hath Contradicted himself <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly,</hi> and by unavoidable Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, in so far as he hath owned, or owns himself a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> and for the <hi>Lawfulness</hi> (not to say the <hi>Necessity</hi>) of <hi>Scottish</hi> Presbyterian Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Assemblies of the <hi>present</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.
<pb facs="tcp:101025:74"/>
For, are all the <hi>Ruling Officers</hi> of Christs appointment, Both <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>Governing Elders</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be <hi>Members</hi> of General As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies? Do they all discharge their <hi>Trust,</hi> and <hi>perform their work by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, there, as they will be Answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him, from whom they got their Trust</hi>? Doth not every <hi>Presbytery</hi> (consisting of 12, 16, or 20 <hi>preaching,</hi> and as many <hi>Ruling Elders</hi>) Send on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly some <hi>Three</hi> or <hi>Four Preaching</hi> El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and only <hi>One Ruling</hi> Elder to the <hi>General Assembly</hi>? Do they not <hi>Delegate</hi> these, and <hi>Devolve</hi> their <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> upon them, and <hi>Constitute</hi> them their <hi>Representatives</hi> for the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly? Let their <hi>Commissions</hi> be Inspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and let it be Tryed, if it is not so: Now, How is such a <hi>Delegation</hi> Consistent with our Authors position about the <hi>Indevolvibility</hi> or <hi>Indelega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> of such a <hi>power</hi>? It were easy to pursue this farther in its Consequents. Now what an ill thing is it, for a man, thus, to sap and subvert all his own Foundations? To Contradict the fundamental <hi>Maximes</hi> of his own <hi>Scheme</hi> by such unadvised proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?
<pb facs="tcp:101025:74"/>
But this is not the worst of it.</p>
            <p>He hath <hi>contradicted</hi> himself most <hi>directly</hi> in that same Individual <hi>True Representation,</hi> &amp;c. in <hi>Answ.</hi> to the 10th <hi>Objection</hi>; and in his 2 <hi>Vind.</hi> p. 154, 155. For in both places he endeavors to justify the Taking of all <hi>Ruling power</hi> out of the hands of the <hi>Episcopal Ministers,</hi> and the <hi>putting</hi> it, only, in the hands of <hi>the Known sound Presbyterians</hi>; Reserving to the Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Ministers, their <hi>Teaching power,</hi> only. 'Tis true, 'Tis evident that he found himself sadly puzled in the Matter, and was forced to bring in his Good Friend <hi>Necessity,</hi> and the Old <hi>Covenant-Distinction</hi> of <hi>Status Ecclesiae turbatus</hi> and <hi>paratus,</hi> to <hi>Lend</hi> him a <hi>Lift.</hi> I have considered his Friend <hi>Necessity,</hi> sufficiently in my Book, and thither I refer the Reader for satisfaction about it. But what to do with his <hi>Praesens Ecclesiae Status,</hi> I do not so well know: Only this I dare say, granting it to be so <hi>nimble</hi> as to break <hi>Scot-free</hi> through <hi>Divine Institutions,</hi> Yet it can, neither by <hi>itself,</hi> nor with <hi>Necessity</hi> to help it, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile</hi> notorious <hi>Contradictions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:101025:75"/>The other Instance I shall adduce is in a very important matter; no less than the <hi>Presbyterian Separation</hi> from the <hi>Episcopal Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland.</hi> He was put to it, to defend it in both his <hi>Vindications</hi> of <hi>his</hi> Church of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. First Vind.</hi> in <hi>Answ.</hi> to <hi>Quest.</hi> 4. 2 <hi>Vind.</hi> in <hi>Answer</hi> to <hi>Letter</hi> 2. § 3. All the Reasons he has for that Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be reduced to these Three, 1. <hi>Episcopacy.</hi> 2. The Episcopal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters were <hi>Vsurpers</hi> or <hi>Intruders:</hi> For 3. They had not the <hi>Call</hi> of the <hi>People</hi>; and so the People were not bound to own them as their Ministers. These are his Grounds, I say, on which he justifies their Separation from us. Now, hear him in his <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Defence,</hi> &amp;c. published, as I have told, since the beginning of the Late Revolution, by Consequence, after the <hi>Scottish Schism</hi> was in its full Maturity: Hear him there, I say, and you never heard Man reject any thing, more fairly, more fully, or more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, than he hath done these his own Grounds. Let us try them one by one.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> turn first to <hi>pag.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:101025:75"/>
95. And you shall find these very words, <hi>Whatever fault we find with the Ministers of the Church and the Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy, we do not separate because of these; we would joyn with you</hi> (the English Church) <hi>for all these Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, if you would but suffer us to do it, without sinning against God in that which is our personal Action.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Turn next to <hi>pag.</hi> 150. There he offers at enumerating the Causes that cannot justify a Separation, and he talks particularly about Episcopacy, thus; <hi>We are grieved with Prelatical Government, and taking away that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Power that Christ hath given to the Ordinary Ministers of his Church. This we cannot approve, and therefore Ministers ought rather to suffer Depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the publick Exercise of their Ministry than own it. And People also ought not to own that, their Lordly Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority that they Exercise; Yet, because this is not Required to be acknowledged as a Lawful Power in the Church, by the People, I see not that we should with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from the Publick Assemblies, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because there are Diocesan Bishops set over the Church; Except our owning
<pb facs="tcp:101025:76"/>
them by submitting to their Iurisdiction is Required as one of the Terms of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Church.</hi> Who so pleases may find more to the same purpose, <hi>pag.</hi> 157, 275, &amp;c. Nay,</p>
            <p>So condescending is he in that Book (<hi>p.</hi> 159.) that he can allow Bishops their Temporal Honours and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. <hi>We meddle not with their Titles and Revenues</hi> (says he) <hi>These are the Magistrates Gifts, and do not cross Christ's institution, whatever inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may be in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As to the <hi>Plea</hi> of the <hi>Vsurpation</hi> or <hi>Intrusion</hi> of the Prelatists, D. <hi>Still.</hi> had alledged that the Dissenters pleaded,
<q>That most of the present Ministers of the Church of <hi>England</hi> were <hi>Vsurpers,</hi> and that from such the People might lawfully separate.</q>
               <hi>We deny both parts of the Assertion,</hi> (says <hi>G. R.</hi> p. 115, 116.) <hi>Whatever</hi> Usurpation <hi>some of them may be guilty of, we know most of them have the</hi> (Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite, <hi>at least</hi>) <hi>consent of the People,</hi> a post facto; <hi>and therefore however they may be guilty of</hi> Intrusion <hi>in their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in their continuing in their places they are no</hi> Usurpers: <hi>Neither do we
<pb facs="tcp:101025:76"/>
own it to be lawful to</hi> separate <hi>from Every Minister that is ane</hi> Usurper, <hi>Meerly on the Account of his Vsurpation.</hi> And he discourses the point copiously; as the curious Reader may find, <hi>ibid.</hi> Neither is he less positive about the</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thing, which, in his <hi>Scottish</hi> Management of the <hi>Plea,</hi> he insists on as the Great Reason of the former, <hi>viz. The Popular Call.</hi>
               <q>For D <hi>Still.</hi> had adduced D. <hi>Owen</hi> as asserting, that the depriving of the People of the Right to choose their own Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors was a just Ground of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q>
And <hi>G. R.</hi> answers, <hi>If Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> Owen <hi>hath done so, Let it pass for a part of the Independent Iudgment which was a mistake of that Eminent Servant of God; Others are not of that Mind.</hi> And a little after: <hi>The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by the Laws of the Gospel have the Right of Election of their own Pastors; But it doth not follow that they ought not to bear with being hindered the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of this Right for the sake of Peace and Vnity.</hi> And p. 151. <hi>Depriving the People of their Right of chusing their own Church Officers, is also Matter of Complaint, but we must bear it rather
<pb facs="tcp:101025:77"/>
than separate for that, from a Church.</hi> And pag. 197. when he came to assert that <hi>Right</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> He told he did <hi>Not make the Depriving of the People of that Power, a Cause of Separation.</hi> Nay,</p>
            <p>Not once, but very frequently, he lays the whole stress of the <hi>English</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, Upon the sinful terms of Communion (as he calls them) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Let the Church purge her Offices of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Inventions, Let her lay aside the the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> the <hi>Cross</hi> in <hi>Baptism, Kneeling</hi> at the Receiving of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist,</hi> and <hi>Holy-days,</hi> &amp;c. and he, and all his Party shall joyn with her chearfully, <hi>Vide</hi> p. 24, 81, 106, 107, 109, 120, 133, 144, 151, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now</p>
            <p>Let any Man, even of his own Sect, reconcile these things: Let him shew why <hi>Episcopacy, Vsurpation,</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving the People</hi> of their <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>choose</hi> their own <hi>Pastors,</hi> should be so <hi>every way</hi> sufficient Grounds for <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating</hi> from the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and so <hi>no ways</hi> sufficient grounds for <hi>separating</hi> from the Church of <hi>England.</hi> What could move the Man to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon such lumpish, bulkish Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions? For my part, I cannot
<pb facs="tcp:101025:77"/>
guess at another Motive than that which I have frequently mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> The present Argument.</p>
            <p>In <hi>England</hi> he had some other things to bear the Burden, but no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing in <hi>Scotland</hi>; and it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for his <hi>Vindicatorship</hi> to <hi>justify</hi> the <hi>Separation:</hi> And therefore what could not do it in <hi>England,</hi> behoved to do it in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But perhaps he may endeavour to extricate himself by running for shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Old <hi>Scottish Plea</hi> of the <hi>Covenant.</hi> For, Is not <hi>Prelacy abjur'd in</hi> Scotland? Is not the <hi>Oath</hi> of God upon <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> nay on all the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> not to own <hi>Prelacy</hi>? Are not all the <hi>Prelatists perjur'd,</hi> &amp;c.? And now may not the Presbyterians <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate</hi> lawfully?</p>
            <p>He seems indeed to betake himself to this <hi>Plea,</hi> in his <hi>Answer</hi> to the <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storical Relation of the General Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,</hi> § 20. p. 189. <hi>The setting up of Episcopacy</hi> (says he) <hi>was more sinful in this Nation</hi> (Scotland) <hi>than it could be elsewhere, because of the Oath of God that the Nation is under, against it; Not in latter times only, but in the times
<pb facs="tcp:101025:78"/>
of King</hi> James <hi>the</hi> Sixth, <hi>who caused the whole Nation swear the Shorter Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Faith, called the National Covenant, where it is abjured.</hi> Now</p>
            <p>Not to insist on shewing that, upon the supposition, all this were true, it militates only against <hi>Episcopacy</hi>; It could conclude it only, but neither the <hi>Vsurpation,</hi> nor the <hi>Depriving</hi> the <hi>People</hi> of their <hi>Right,</hi> &amp;c. to be a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Ground for the <hi>Separation.</hi> Nor yet to insist on the notorious falshood of the supposition, <hi>viz.</hi> That Episcopacy was abjured in King <hi>Iames</hi> the <hi>Sixths</hi> time. Not to insist on these things, I say,</p>
            <p>If he <hi>himself</hi> is strong enough for <hi>himself<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> himself</hi> will not suffer <hi>himself</hi> to make the <hi>Abjuration</hi> of Episcopacy in <hi>Scotland,</hi> a sufficient Ground for <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating</hi> from the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi> For in the 40th page of his <hi>Rational Defence,</hi> &amp;c. Attempting to shew a Difference between comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Church of <hi>England</hi> at the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and complying with her <hi>Now,</hi> he opens thus: <hi>I might here alledge the Obligation of the National Covenant that we are under, as they were
<pb facs="tcp:101025:78"/>
not to whom the Doctor would make our Case parallel</hi> (i. e. those who lived at the Reformation) <hi>Tho I never thought that that Bond made any Sins or Duties that were not such Antecedently.</hi> Now</p>
            <p>(Not to insist on the <hi>Pleasantness</hi> of pretending that he might insist on a <hi>Topick,</hi> in which he instantly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges there is no <hi>Force</hi>;) If <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Covenants make no Duties nor Sins, which were not such Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,</hi> I would fain understand, how the <hi>National Covenant,</hi> or whatever <hi>Covenant</hi> has been in <hi>Scotland,</hi> could make Episcopacy a <hi>sufficient Ground</hi> for <hi>Separating</hi> from the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi>; if it was not a <hi>sufficient Ground</hi> for <hi>such Separation Antecedent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> to these <hi>Covenants</hi>? Thus he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self hath cut off himself from all hopes of escaping by the <hi>Covenant.</hi> Indeed there is no possibility of Escape left him: It is not in the power of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to rescue one who is so plunged over Head and Ears in such a Sink of Contradictions.</p>
            <p>What hath been said might be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, in all Conscience, for repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting his own <hi>Vnnatural</hi> Unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
<pb facs="tcp:101025:79"/>
towards himself: For what can be more <hi>Vnmercifully</hi> done to one, than to demonstrate him to all the world to be a <hi>Manifest Lier</hi>? And who can be a <hi>more</hi> manifest <hi>Lier</hi> than he, who, upon every turn, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits Contradictions? Yet this is not all, perhaps it is not the worst.</p>
            <p>There is such an <hi>Intimate Relation</hi> between <hi>himself</hi> and his <hi>Books</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by <hi>himself,</hi> That, I think, 'tis rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable to say, that whosoever treats his <hi>Books</hi> with any Degrees of <hi>Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> is every whit as <hi>Impudent</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>himself.</hi> Now, it is not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that Ranker, more Mercyless, or more Impudent injury can be done to any thing, than himself hath done to his <hi>Second Vindication</hi> of <hi>his</hi> Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi> At least, to near three parts of four of it: To it, so far as it Answers <hi>The Four Letters, The Case of the Afflicted Clergy,</hi> and the <hi>Late Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> For he hath engraven on it such indelible Characters of Disingenuity, Partiality, Injustice, Unfair Dealing, Effrontery, Ridiculousness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as perhaps never Book was injur'd or bespattered with, since writing of
<pb facs="tcp:101025:79"/>
Books was in fashion. The Reader may think this is a very strange Charge: But I can make it good, to a Demonstration, by a very plain and obvious Deduction. Thus,</p>
            <p>Some of the Episcopal Clergy, thought themselves obliged for their own Vindication, to give some short Representations of their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, and the Unkindly Treatment they had met with from the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Party, <hi>An.</hi> 1688, 1689, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The whole Nation knows, they were so far from feigning instances, or ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating the circumstances of their Sufferings, that they told not the twentieth part of what they suffered; nor represented what they told in all its proper Blacknesses: However, so much was told, as was enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the Presbyterian Temper in no very Lovely Colours. The Party were sensible of this; And therefore, it was necessary to try if there was a possibiltty of Collecting and Conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting some Rags to cover their Shame and Nakedness. The Expedient they agreed to was, that the <hi>Accounts</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the Episcopal Clergy should be
<pb facs="tcp:101025:80"/>
Answered and Refuted: But then the Difficulty was to find ane Author, who had <hi>Talents</hi> proper for such a <hi>Task.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was committed, first to Mr. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Pitcairn</hi>: But after he had thought some time about it, it seems, It stood with his Stomach: He had not so far abandoned all Principles of Truth, and Honesty, and Ingenuity, as was necessary for such ane Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking; he resign'd the imployment, therefore into the hands of another <hi>General Meeting</hi> of the Party, and told them, He would have nothing to do with it.</p>
            <p>This, no doubt, was a Discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to all others of any <hi>Wit</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity,</hi> to undertake it: For if it was to be <hi>done,</hi> to any good purpose at all, <hi>Pitcairn</hi> was as fit for <hi>doing</hi> of it as any of the <hi>Sect</hi>: And if he gave it over, after so much Deliberation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, it was to be presumed, there was <hi>Frost</hi> in it; it was not safe to meddle with it. Thus it fell to the share of <hi>G. R.</hi> as he tells himself both in his <hi>Preface,</hi> and in the <hi>Beginning</hi> of his Book.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:101025:80"/>Such ane <hi>Odd</hi> Undertaking did, indeed, require a suitable Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker; and now it had one as <hi>oddly</hi> qualified for it as the world has heard of. For if we may believe himself in his <hi>Preface</hi> to his <hi>Anim.</hi> on D. <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet</hi>'s <hi>Irenicum</hi> (for who but himself would have been at pains to write Prefaces to his Books?) <hi>He died a worthy and much lamented Author, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> 1662. And, so far as I can learn, he continued thus in the state of the dead, till towards the end of the year 1688. <hi>i. e.</hi> about 26 years. Then, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he return'd to Life. Now, it is not to be imagin'd, his Soul, all this while, was either in the Regions of Eternal Rewards, or Eternal Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for, then, how should it have returned? Doubtless, therefore, it was in some <hi>Purgatory</hi>: But what <hi>Purgatory,</hi> is not easy to determine. I am confident, it was not the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Purgatory,</hi> in which People are purg'd from the Dregs of Corruption they carry out of this world with them; for he came alive again more <hi>corrupted</hi> and <hi>vicious</hi> than ever. Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly, he has been in some <hi>New Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:101025:81"/>
which the <hi>Pope</hi> built lately for keeping a Seminary of such as he lets out upon Occasion, for <hi>Plagues</hi> to the <hi>Protestant</hi> Churches. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Purgatory</hi> it was, Our Author came out of it, <hi>purged</hi> pretty clean of all principles of <hi>Sense,</hi> or <hi>Shame,</hi> or <hi>Honesty.</hi> And now, who fitter than he to be the <hi>Vindicator</hi> of the <hi>Kirk</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi>? Before his <hi>Death</hi> he wrote only such <hi>Books as were little in their own Eyes</hi> (Pref. to <hi>Anim.</hi> on <hi>Irenicum</hi>) but he ventured on writing such Books as his <hi>Second Vindication,</hi> after his <hi>Resurrection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have given this Account of our Author, and the Occasion of his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Book, for fixing the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders attention, that he may consider it with the greater Application.</p>
            <p>Now, in this Book, (His <hi>Second Vindication,</hi> I mean) he rejected, by the Bulk, all the Matters of Fact, which were contain'd in the <hi>Four Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> because they were not <hi>Attested</hi>; as if, forsooth, the Writers of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters had had opportunity to have had all the particular Cases, Tried in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Courts, before Indifferent Judges,
<pb facs="tcp:101025:81"/>
and with all the Usual Solemnities of Process: As if it had been their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, by their Letters, to have made formal Pursuits for the Injuries had been done the Clergy. As if the World could not have easily Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, That all their purpose in writing these Letters, was not to sue Legally for Redress, but to represent to their Friends, Matter of Fact, in the common way of History. Well!</p>
            <p>To mend this, however, <hi>The Case of the afflicted Clergy</hi> gave him <hi>Attesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> enough, in all Conscience: But did that satisfy him? No more than if he had got none at all, for they were not worth a Button, they were not probative, they were but partial; he had reason to reject every one of them. Thus,</p>
            <p>When the Author of the Case, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> cited D. <hi>Burnet, G. R.</hi> reply'd in these words; <hi>He farther proveth our Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution by citing some passages out of</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor Burnet, <hi>whom, being a party, we are not to admit as a Witness against us.</hi> (85) What? No not D. <hi>Burnet</hi>? No not the <hi>Son</hi> of such a <hi>Mother</hi>? No not the <hi>Nephew</hi> of such ane <hi>Vncle</hi>? No
<pb facs="tcp:101025:82"/>
not the <hi>Brother</hi> of such a <hi>Brother</hi>? No not the <hi>Cousin German</hi> of such a <hi>Cousin German</hi>? No not the <hi>Man</hi> who has all alongst advised the <hi>Scottish</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latists (particularly Mr. <hi>Malcome,</hi> one of the Ministers of <hi>Edenburgh</hi>) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their Native Country, and submit to the Ecclesiastical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>Now</hi> Established; Do you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject even him as a <hi>party</hi>? But to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
            <p>If the person who was barbarously used by the Rabble, gave an Account of his own Usage, (and who could do it better?) and subscribed his name to it; This was such ane <hi>Attestation,</hi> as <hi>G. R.</hi> thought fit to reject with a <hi>Fie upon it.</hi> It was <hi>Teste Meipso,</hi> (p. 88.) and so, not worth ane half-pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: As if it had been possible for a Minister, when the Rabble surprized him, and came upon him unawares, still to have had witnesses at hand for <hi>Attesting</hi> all their Rudenesses; as if it had not been enough for all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of such <hi>Accounts,</hi> that a Man of known Probity and Reputation, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed his own Narration of a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact which so nearly concerned
<pb facs="tcp:101025:82"/>
himself, and thereby declared his Readiness to make the Matter appear, as far as he was capable.</p>
            <p>If the Rabbled Minister adduced Witnesses (as was done in <hi>the Case,</hi> &amp;c. in several Instances) And they sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed the Account, was he then sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied? Never ane Ace more than before. <hi>All of his Witnesses are the sworn Enemies of Presbyterians, and in a Combination to defame them,</hi> (p. 88.) And again (p. 100.) <hi>His first Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is of Accounts that he hath had from his Complices, a company of Men avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and malicious Enemies of all Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians— and all this attested by themselves.</hi> Nay,</p>
            <p>Tho they were not Episcopal <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,</hi> but <hi>Laicks</hi> who <hi>attested,</hi> if it was done in favour of Episcopal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, that was enough to prove them Friends to Episcopacy, and so they were no more <hi>Boni &amp; Legales Homines,</hi> as he calls his <hi>Vnexceptiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Witnesses,</hi> (p. 111.) Thus,</p>
            <p>The Account which was sent to <hi>London</hi> immediately after the Second Tumult at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> which happened on the 17th of <hi>Feb. Anno</hi> 1688/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> was
<pb facs="tcp:101025:83"/>
subscribed by <hi>Iames Gibson,</hi> then One of the Magistrates of the City; <hi>Iohn Gillhagie,</hi> who had been a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate the year before; and <hi>Patrick Bell,</hi> Son to Sir <hi>Iohn Bell,</hi> a discreet young Gentleman, and Merchant in the City.</p>
            <p>These three subscribed it, that it might <hi>make Faith</hi>; it was directed to <hi>Doctor Fall,</hi> Principal of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> that he might shew it to the then P. of <hi>O.</hi> and crave, that now, that he had taken upon him the Government of the Kingdom of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> he would interpose his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for discharging such Tumults for the future, <hi>&amp;c. Doctor Fall</hi> actually addressed to his Highness, and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Account. All this was done before the <hi>Scottish</hi> Estates met in <hi>March.</hi> Now consider <hi>G. R.</hi>'s Discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of this Account. (p. 94.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iohn</hi> (he should have called him <hi>Iames</hi>) <hi>Gibson was a Party, and made a Bailie by the Archbishop, and all know the Prelates Inclinations towards the present Civil Government.</hi> Have ye not here a goodly <hi>Specimen</hi> of both our Authors <hi>Law</hi> and his <hi>Logick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:101025:83"/>
               <hi>Iohn Gillhagie is lookt on by all as a Foolish and Rash Man, who little consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth what he doth.</hi> Now what was his Testimony worth after our Author had given him such a Character?</p>
            <p>Patrick Bell <hi>and his Brother were soon after seized for Treasonable Practices, were long in Prison, and are now under Bail.</hi> And is not <hi>G. R.</hi> now a potent Author? How easily and readily he can reject Testimonies! And these three once thus rejected, There was never such a thing as that Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Tumult at <hi>Glasgow</hi>: No not tho there are Hundreds in <hi>Glasgow</hi> who can <hi>attest,</hi> that every syllable of the Account was true. Again,</p>
            <p>Pag. 109. in Mr. <hi>Gellies</hi> Case, How easily could he reject all the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies that were adduced? Why? <hi>They that testify for him are of his own party:</hi> And then let them testify that they saw a <hi>Nose</hi> on <hi>G. R.</hi>'s own <hi>Face,</hi> and for any thing I know, he should cut off his own <hi>Nose</hi> to have them <hi>Liers.</hi> And now,</p>
            <p>Let the World judge of this way of disproving Historical Relations and Attestations of Matters of Fact: Is it
<pb facs="tcp:101025:84"/>
not plain that according to this Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard, it is impossible to <hi>Attest</hi> any thing? For as I take it, the whole Nation is so divided between Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latists and Presbyterians, or those who favour One of the sides, that you shall not find many Neutrals. Now, who is obliged to take the Testimonies of Presbyterians, in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fact, more than the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Prelatists? Have they any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, Natural or Municipal Law for the Validity of their Testimonies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond other Men? If they have not, as I shall still be apt to believe till <hi>G R.</hi> produces the Law, then I would fain know how <hi>G. R.</hi> by his own Standard can allow, That Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Witnesses should appear before any Court Ecclesiastical or Civil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Episcopal Ministers. Nay, may not the Presbyterians themselves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject even <hi>G. R.</hi>s Testimony? Nay I say they ought to do it: Why? He stands nearly related to Episcopacy. How? Let it be enquired into and I'le hold him two to one, if he was Baptized at all, he was Baptized ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a Bishop, or by a Presbyter
<pb facs="tcp:101025:84"/>
that submitted to Bishops. But if so, then good morrow to his Testimony: For thus the Argument runs, <hi>G. R.</hi> was Baptized by a Prelate or a Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist, <hi>and all know the Prelates inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Why this Reasoning should not hold in <hi>G. R.</hi>'s Case, as well as in <hi>Iames Gibson</hi>'s Case, I desire to learn of <hi>G. R.</hi> when he is at Leisure. But this is not all.</p>
            <p>As he rejected all the <hi>Attestations</hi> in that Book, without any shew of Reason, so he did some in Despight of the Common Sense of Mankind. For setting this in its due Light, it is to be Remembred, that, in that Book, there are Accounts of the Insolencies committed by the Rabble upon such and such Ministers in the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>Glasgow, Hamilton, Irwing, Air, Paisley, Dumbarton, &amp;c.</hi> Now these Accounts were occasioned thus,</p>
            <p>When the Rabble was in its fury, and making Havock of all the Clergy in the <hi>Western</hi> Diocess of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> some of them met at <hi>Glasgow</hi> upon the 22 of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> 1688/9. to consider what might be proper for them to do for
<pb facs="tcp:101025:85"/>
their own Preservation, and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction against the Rage of their Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors: And the best Expedient they could then fall upon, was to send Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Scot</hi> Dean of <hi>Glasgow</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> to represent their Condition to his Highness the <hi>P.</hi> of <hi>O.</hi> who had then assumed the Government of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and crave protection according to Law. And that the <hi>Doctor</hi> might be the better instructed, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, that particular <hi>Accounts</hi> of the <hi>Violences</hi> had been done to the Clergy within the abovenamed Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries should be digested by such Ministers as lived within these Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries, respectively: This was done. The <hi>Account</hi> of the <hi>Violences</hi> done to those who lived within the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of <hi>Air,</hi> was digested and signed by Mr. <hi>Alexander Gregory,</hi> Mr. <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Irwine,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Francis Fordyce</hi>; that for <hi>Paisley,</hi> by Mr. <hi>Fullerton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Taylour,</hi> Ministers at <hi>Paisley</hi>; that for <hi>Glasgow,</hi> by Mr. <hi>George,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sage, &amp;c.</hi> And that the Truth of these <hi>Accounts</hi> might be the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>onable, the Subscribers (in some of them, at least) undertook to make
<pb facs="tcp:101025:85"/>
all the particulars appear to be true, upon the greatest peril, if they should get a fair Hearing. What greater Evidence of Truth and Ingenuity could have been expected or required of People in such Circumstances? Yet,</p>
            <p>Even these accounts <hi>G. R.</hi> rejected, as readily and con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>idently as he did any other; he rejected them I say, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discriminately,</hi> and without taking notice of any difference between them, and such as were not written upon any such Occasion, such as were only vouched <hi>Teste Meipso.</hi> Was this like either the <hi>Sense</hi> or the <hi>Discretion</hi> that were proper for the <hi>Vindicator</hi> of a Church? I do not incline, so much as in the least, to insinuate, that any of the Accounts contained in <hi>The Case of the afflicted Clergy,</hi> were false; I am satisfied they were all ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true: All I intend, is to represent <hi>G. R.</hi>'s impudent Rashness in rejecting all <hi>Accounts</hi> with the same <hi>facility</hi>: And certainly, whosoever considers this seriously, cannot but reckon of his Book as written with as little <hi>Wit</hi> or <hi>Discretion,</hi> as <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Ingenuity.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:101025:86"/>
And all this will appear more evident still, if it be considered, that,</p>
            <p>All this did not content him; but he was such a Fool, as to stumble up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the same Methods, himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd most, in his Adversaries, when he had any Matter of <hi>Fact</hi> to <hi>Attest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was very careful, as he tells fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, to have his particular infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations from all Corners, concerning all the Instances of Rabbling which were represented in the <hi>Prelatick</hi> Pamphlets? But from whom had he these Informations, mostly? From the very <hi>Rabblers</hi> themselves. It were both tedious and unprofitable to trace him through all instances: One may be sufficient for ane example. And I shall choose the very first that is to be found in his Book, <hi>viz.</hi> That of Master <hi>Gabriel Russel</hi> Minister at <hi>Govean.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Author of the Second Letter had given a brief and a just Account of the Treatment, that poor Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had met with. And <hi>G. R.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels it thus, <hi>To this, I oppose,</hi> says he, <hi>The Truth of the Story, as it is attested by the Subscriptions of Nine Persons
<pb facs="tcp:101025:86"/>
who were present,</hi> i. e. Nine of the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers; for so Mr. <hi>Russel</hi> himself assured me, repeating over these very names which <hi>G. R.</hi> has in his Book. And is not this a pleasant <hi>Attestation</hi>? Is it not <hi>pleasant,</hi> I say, to rely upon the Testimony of such barbarous Villains, and take their own <hi>word</hi> for their own <hi>Vindication</hi>? Yet there's one thing, a great deal more <hi>pleasant</hi> yet, in the Story.</p>
            <p>The Author of the <hi>Second Letter</hi> had affirmed, that Mr. <hi>Russel</hi> was bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the Rabble; <hi>But they</hi> (the nine whom he adduces) <hi>utterly deny, That any of them did beat him.</hi> And 'tis true indeed, none of these nine did beat him; but 'tis as true that he was beaten: And one <hi>Iames Col<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uhoun</hi> was the person who did it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Name was concealed, and not set down with the other nine. And now I refer it to the Reader, if it is not probable, that he has got a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of sweet History from <hi>G. R.</hi> in his <hi>Second Vindication.</hi> But I go on.</p>
            <p>As he thus adduced the Rabble witnessing for themselves; so when he was put to it, he never stood on
<pb facs="tcp:101025:87"/>
adducing the Testimonies of single Presbyterian Ministers, witnessing for the Honesty and Integrity of the Rabblers, or in opposition to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latical Relations. Thus,</p>
            <p>In <hi>White</hi>'s Case (<hi>p.</hi> 32.) he adduces five Men, testifying that the Accounts of <hi>White</hi>'s Sufferings were false, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And for the Honesty of these five he tells us, <hi>They have all their Testimony from their Minister that they are credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and famous Witnesses.</hi> And</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 105. He rejects <hi>Bullo</hi>'s account, who was Episcopal Minister at <hi>Stobo,</hi> in one word, thus, <hi>In this Narrative are many Lies, which is attested by Mr.</hi> William Russel (Presbyterian) <hi>Minister at</hi> Stobo. But the best is,</p>
            <p>After he had run down all the Prelatical Accounts by this Upright Dealing of his, and concluded them all most horrid <hi>Liers</hi> and <hi>Calumniators,</hi> and all their <hi>Relations</hi> most horrid <hi>Lies</hi> and <hi>Calumnies</hi>: He tells you gravely in his <hi>Preface,</hi> § 6. <hi>That the Truth of Matters of Fact, asserted in his Book is not to be taken from him, but from his Informers. That he pretends to personal Knowledge of few of them:
<pb facs="tcp:101025:87"/>
That therefore, not his Veracity, but theirs, is pledged for the Truth</hi> of the Accounts he has published; <hi>That if they have deceived him, or been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived themselves, he is not to Answer for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let the World judge if this was not a <hi>sure foot</hi> for supporting such Superstructures as he rais'd upon it; and if his <hi>Second Vindication</hi> is not a <hi>pleasant Book.</hi> Was it possible for him to have <hi>Farced</hi> it with more <hi>bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced</hi> Iniquities? What picqu'd the Man, so, at his own Book, as to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish it with so many fair Evidences of Disingenuity, Partiality, Effrontery, and Downright Ridiculousness, about it? What could move him to treat his own Brat with so little compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Was not this, even in a Literal sense <hi>Male Natum exponere foetum</hi>? Or rather what meant <hi>he</hi> by treating <hi>himself</hi> so unmercifully? For who sees not that all the <hi>Infamy</hi> termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates on the Author, in the <hi>Rebound</hi>?</p>
            <p>But, perchance, now that he is a profound Philosophick <hi>Head</hi> of a <hi>Colledge,</hi> he may fall on a way to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish between his <hi>own</hi> and his
<pb facs="tcp:101025:88"/>
               <hi>Books</hi> Credit: Perchance he may think his <hi>own</hi> Credit secure enough, whatever hazard his <hi>Books</hi> may run. Well! He may try it if he will; but I would advise him not to be rash in falling out so with the Book; For, as sorry a Book as it is, yet, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that with the assistance of a Neighbour Book, it can serve him a <hi>Trick,</hi> that may be sufficient to put even his <hi>impudent self</hi> a little out of Countenance. I'll be so kind to him as to let him see where the Danger lies.</p>
            <p>He may remember, That the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>Second Letter</hi> (which, by the most probable Calculation I can make, was written in <hi>December</hi> 1689, or <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1690.) endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make it appear as probable, That the Leading Men in Government were, then, very much inclined to <hi>Iustify</hi> the <hi>Expulsion</hi> of the <hi>Clergy</hi> by the <hi>Rabble,</hi> and sustain their Churches <hi>vacuated</hi> by that <hi>Expulsion</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by cut off these poor Men from all hopes of being restored to their <hi>Churches</hi> or <hi>Livings,</hi> tho they had neither been Convicted of any
<pb facs="tcp:101025:88"/>
Crime, nor Deprived by any Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. Now</p>
            <p>There's another Book, called <hi>Ane Account of the Late Establishment of Presbyterian Government by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Anno</hi> 1690. which gives a full and fair Account, how the thing was actually <hi>Done,</hi> how the <hi>Expulsion</hi> of the <hi>Clergy</hi> by the <hi>Rabble</hi> was actually <hi>Iustified</hi> by that same <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> which established Presbyterian Government.</p>
            <p>If <hi>G. R.</hi> has not seen that Book, or is resolved to reject its Testimony because probably written by a <hi>Party</hi>: I can refer him to the Universal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of the whole Nation, that such a thing <hi>was Done,</hi> by that Act of Parliament: Nay I can refer him to the Act of Parliament it self.</p>
            <p>That Book tells also a shrewd story concerning a Presbyterian Minister, called Mr. <hi>Gilbert Rule,</hi> who preached a Sermon before the Parliament on the 25 of <hi>May,</hi> being the <hi>Sunday</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Act</hi> was <hi>Voted</hi> in the <hi>House</hi>; And, before he published it, wrote a <hi>Preface</hi> to it, after the Act was <hi>Voted,</hi> in which he <hi>thanked</hi> the <hi>House</hi> very
<pb facs="tcp:101025:89"/>
heartily for <hi>Voting</hi> such ane Act: And if <hi>G. R.</hi> distrusts that Book, I refer him to Mr. <hi>Rule</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s printed <hi>Preface</hi> to his Sermon, where I am confident he may find satisfaction. Nay, I dare appeal to <hi>G. R.</hi> himself, if he knew not all these things to be true, before he wrote one Syllable of his <hi>Second Vindication</hi>: For these things were transacted, every one of them, before the middle of <hi>Iune</hi> 1690, and his <hi>Second Vindication</hi> came not abroad till more than a year after. Well!</p>
            <p>But what of all this? how can this assist <hi>G. R.</hi>'s <hi>Book</hi> against <hi>himself,</hi> if it should be irritated to serve him a Trick? Why? turn over to <hi>p.</hi> 43, 44 <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and consider how it disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in him such a <hi>Brawny Impudence,</hi> as never Ghost appearing in humane shape was guilty of, before him. For</p>
            <p>Tho the <hi>Letter-man</hi> was fully justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Event; tho what he said <hi>seem'd</hi> to be intended by the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, appear'd undeniably to have been intended by them in the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; tho they <hi>Iustified</hi> the <hi>Expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> of the <hi>Clergy</hi> by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>Rabble</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as plainly and positively as ane Act of
<pb facs="tcp:101025:89"/>
Parliament could do it; So plainly and positively, that the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was sensible of it, and cried shame upon it; That some Members, in the very time, resented it highly, calling it ane indelible Reproach up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Justice of the Nation; That many Members to this very minute will frankly acknowledge, there was never greater or more notorious ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity established by a Law. Tho <hi>G. R.</hi> knew it so well, and was so much pleased with it, that he thanked the Parliament with all his Soul for it, telling them, <hi>He and his Party were filled with Ioy, while they beheld the Religious Regard which the High and Honourable Court of Parliament had shewed to the Mountain of the Lords House, above other Mountains; in the Great Step towards the Establishing thereof that they had made by their Vote.</hi> (Whereof that Justification of the Rabble was a great part) Tho he prayed, <hi>That the Lord would reward them for their good Deeds</hi> (whereof this was one) <hi>towards his House.</hi> Tho all these things were, and are, clear as the Light, and uncontroulable
<pb facs="tcp:101025:90"/>
as Matter of Fact can be; yet</p>
            <p>
               <hi>G. R.</hi> lasht the <hi>Letter-man</hi> till he had almost <hi>flea'd</hi> him; made him a <hi>Railer,</hi> one who <hi>Vnderstood</hi> no <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,</hi> a <hi>Strainer at Silly Quibbles,</hi> one who had ane Extraordinary Dose of <hi>Brow,</hi> and whose <hi>Wit was a Wool<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> gathering, &amp;c.</hi> And all this for telling this plain Truth, That the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had a design to Justify the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion of the Clergy by the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>Thus I think, I have made it appear how little tender <hi>G. R.</hi> was, even of his own beloved self, when he was straitned in his Argument: I might have easily adduced more Instances; but the Truth is, I am now very wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of him; and he himself has done himself the Justice, to represent himself to any Mans Satisfaction, who shall not be satisfied with the Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I have given of him: For he hath fairly own'd, that he sets himself in opposition to those whom he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges to be the <hi>Soberest</hi> and <hi>Wisest</hi> of his party. I don't love to be unjust to him; I'le give it you in his own words, as I find them, 1 <hi>Vind. Ans.</hi> to <hi>Quest.</hi> 5. § 6.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:101025:90"/>He was complaining of the Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions his Party had met with for keeping <hi>Conventicles,</hi> &amp;c. And amongst other things, he discourses thus, <hi>There might have been some shadow for such severity against Meeting</hi> (at Field-Conventicles) <hi>with Arms, tho even that was in some Cases necessary; but that was always disallowed by the Soberest and Wisest</hi> Presbyterians Now tis plain, there are here these two Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatives. 1. That <hi>Meeting with Arms at Field Conventicles was in some Cases necessary</hi>: This is our Authors sentiment. 2. That <hi>Meeting with Arms at Field Conventicles, was always disallowed by the Soberest and Wisest Presbyterians:</hi> This, I say, he plainly affirms to have been always the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent of the <hi>Soberest</hi> and <hi>Wisest.</hi> By Consequence; are not both these Affirmatives joyned together <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb facs="tcp:101025:91"/>
               <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Futility</hi>? For who but a <hi>Futile Fool</hi> would have said, that he differed in his Sentiments from the <hi>Soberest</hi> and <hi>Wisest</hi>? And now, to bring all home to my Original pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
            <p>By this time, I think, I have given Reason enough for my refusing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of him for ane Answerer of my Book. No Man on Earth, I think, would willingly enter the Lists with one who is so singular for four such <hi>Cardinal</hi> Talents. Tho <hi>Incureable Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance</hi> and <hi>Incorrigible Nonsence,</hi> may be something <hi>pitiable,</hi> as being the <hi>Vices</hi> of Nature rather than <hi>Choice</hi>; yet, 'tis no small <hi>Persecution</hi> for one to be obliged to grapple with them. What must it be then to be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the other two? <hi>Rank Ill-nature,</hi> I mean, and the most <hi>stubborn Impudence</hi>?</p>
            <p>Some <hi>Ill Natures</hi> may be <hi>cured:</hi> Men may be either <hi>cajol'd</hi> or <hi>cudgel'd</hi> out of them. <hi>Agelastus</hi> himself <hi>laught</hi> once; so did Duke <hi>D Alva:</hi> But what hopes can there be of one whose <hi>Common Sense</hi> is so intrinsecally <hi>viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated,</hi> that he can <hi>avouch</hi> the <hi>coursest,</hi>

            <p>I think our Author may be sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that it is not a <hi>good</hi> thing to cast a <hi>bad</hi> Copy to the world, lest some, for Curiosity, try if they can imitate it.

            <p>One thing I am sure of, I have been faithful in my Citations from his Books: And I am not conscious that I have, so much as <hi>once</hi> forced ane <hi>Vnnatural</hi> sense on his words: For this, I am satisfied, that what I have said, be tried with the greatest and most impartial Accuracy.

if he is such ane Author as I have truly represented him to be I hope the world will allow that I <hi>had,</hi> and still <hi>have</hi> Reason to refuse to have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Dealing with him. Nay farther,</p>
            <p>I think 'tis nothing for the Honour or Reputation of his Party, that he was ever imployed to be the <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator</hi> of their <hi>Kirk.</hi> If they can im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy any civil, discreet, ingenuous person to write for them, I shall be heartily satisfied; and for his Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, I do promise, if he falls to my share, I shall treat him suitably.

            <p>THis Article was Established in our <hi>Claim of Right,</hi> April 11, 1689. By vertue of this Article <hi>Prelacy</hi> was actually Abolished by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Iuly</hi> 22. 1689. Upon the foot of

this Article <hi>Presbyterian Government</hi> was E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished, <hi>Iune</hi> 7. <hi>Anno</hi> 1690. This <hi>Act</hi> Establishing Presbyterian Government was Ratified in the whole <hi>Heads, Articles</hi> and <hi>Clauses</hi> thereof, <hi>Iune</hi> 12. 1693. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disputable then, That This Article is the Great Foundation of that Great Alteration which hath been made in the Government of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> since the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Late Revolution. Whether, therefore, This is a <hi>Solid</hi> or a <hi>Sandy</hi> Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation? cannot but be deem'd a Material Question: And, I think, I shall bid fair for the Determination of this Question, if I can give clear and distinct Satisfaction to these following Enquiries.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Whether the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> was Reform'd solely, by persons cloath'd with the Character of <hi>Presbyters</hi>?</p>
            <p n="2">II. Whether our <hi>Scottish</hi> Reformers, whatever their Characters were, were of the present Presbyterian Principles? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were for the Divine institution of <hi>Parity,</hi> and the unlawfulness of <hi>Prelacy,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Pastors of the Church?</p>
            <p n="3">III. Whether Prelacy and the superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of any Office in the Church, above Presbyters, was a great and insupportable Grievance and trouble to this Nation, and contrary to the inclinations of the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the people, ever since the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation?</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:101025:94"/>IV. Whether it was <hi>Such</hi> when this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle was Established in the <hi>Claim of Right</hi>?</p>
            <p n="5">V. Whether, supposing the premisses in the Article were True, They would be of sufficient Force to infer the Conclusion, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Prelacy,</hi> and the Superiority of any Office in the Church, ought to be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished?</p>
            <p>The Determination of the main Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I say, may competently result from a perspicuous discussion of these five Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: And therefore I shall attempt it as fairly as I can, leaving to the world to judge, equitably, of my performance: And without further prefacing, I come to</p>

               <head>The First Enquiry.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Whether the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> was Reformed, solely, by persons cloath'd with the Character of <hi>Presbyters?</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>IF the Framers of the Article meant that it was in these words, <hi>They having Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed from Popery by Presbyters,</hi> I think, I am pretty sure they meant amiss: For there is nothing more obvious to one who reads and compares our Histories, than That persons standing in other stations, and cloath'd with other Characters, had a very
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101025:95"/>
great hand, and were very considerable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments in carrying on our Reformation. Particularly,</p>
               <p n="1">1. There were <hi>Prelates</hi> who concurred in that work as well as <hi>Presbyters. Knox</hi> says there were present in the Parliament holden in <hi>August,</hi> 1560. (which Parliament gave the first National Establishment to our Reformation) <hi>The Bishop of</hi> Galloway, <hi>the Abbots of Lundoris, Culross, St. Colmes-inih, Coldingham, Saint Mary-isle,</hi> and <hi>the Subprior of St. Andrews, with diverse others:</hi> And of all these, he says, <hi>That they had Renounced Papistrie, and openly professed</hi> Jesus Christ. <note n="(a)" place="margin">Kn. 260.</note> 
                  <hi>Spotswood</hi> reckons up no fewer than <hi>Eight</hi> of the <hi>Spiritual Estate,</hi> all <hi>Protestants,</hi> chosen, at that time, to be <hi>Lords of the Articles:</hi> Namely, <note n="(b)" place="margin">Spot. 149.</note> 
                  <hi>the Bishops of Galloway and Argyle, the Prior of St. Andrews, the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots of Aberbrothoik, Kilwinning, Lundors, Newbottle and Culross.</hi> Lay these two Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts together, and you shall have, at least a <hi>Round Dozen</hi> of <hi>Reforming Prelates.</hi> 'Tis True <hi>Spotswood</hi> says, <hi>The Popish Prelates stormed</hi> mightily <hi>at such a Nomination for the Articles, alledging that some of them were meer Laicks.</hi> But what if it was so? I am apt to think, our Presbyterian Brethren will not be <hi>fond</hi> to make much advantage of this: I am apt to think they will not say, That all those whom they allow to have been <hi>Reforming Presbyters,</hi> were <hi>Duely</hi> and <hi>Canonically Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained:</hi> That they were solemnly <hi>seperated</hi> for the Ministery, by such as had <hi>Commission</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:101025:95"/>
and <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>Separate</hi> them, and in such Manner as had Universally obtained, from the Apostles times, in the <hi>Separation</hi> of <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi> for their holy Function. The plain truth is,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our Reformation was principally car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on by such as neither <hi>Did,</hi> nor <hi>Could</hi> pretend to be Canonically promoted to Holy Orders. <hi>Knox</hi> himself <note n="(c)" place="margin">Kn. 127.</note> tells us, that when the Reformation began to make its more publick Advances, which was in the Year 1558. there was a great Scarcety of Preachers: <hi>At that time</hi> (says he) <hi>we had no publick Ministers of the word; Only did certain Zealous Men</hi> (<hi>among whom were</hi> the Laird of Dun, David Forress, Mr. Robert Lockhart, Mr. Robert Hamilton, William Harlaw, <hi>and others</hi>) <hi>Exhort their Brethren, according to the Gifts and Graces granted to them: But shortly after did God stir up his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi> Paul Methven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here, we have but a very Diminutive account of them, as to Number: And such an Account, as, in its very <hi>Air</hi> and <hi>Countenance,</hi> seems to <hi>own</hi> they were generally but <hi>Lay-Brethren:</hi> They were but <hi>Zealous Men,</hi> not <hi>Canonically or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Presbyters</hi>: And if we may believe <hi>Lesly, Paul Methven</hi> was, by Occupation, a <hi>Baker,</hi> and <hi>William Harlaw</hi> a <hi>Taylor.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. After the pacification at <hi>Leith,</hi> which was concluded in <hi>Iuly</hi> 1560, when the Ministers were distributed amongst the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Towns, we find but a very small Number of them. <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> was appointed for <hi>Edenburgh, Christopher Goodman</hi> for <hi>St. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews, Adam Herriot</hi> for <hi>Aberdeen, Iohn Row</hi> for <hi>Perth, William Chrystison</hi> for <hi>Dundee, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid Ferguson</hi> for <hi>Dunfermline, Paul Methven</hi> for <hi>Iedburgh,</hi> and Mr. <hi>David Lindesay</hi> for <hi>Leith.</hi> Beside these, <hi>Five</hi> were nominated to be <hi>Superintendents; Spotswood</hi> for <hi>Lothian</hi> and <hi>Mers, Winram</hi> for <hi>Fife, the Laird of Dun</hi> for <hi>Angus</hi> and <hi>Merns, Willock</hi> for <hi>Glasgow,</hi> and <hi>Carsewell</hi> for <hi>Argyle</hi> and the <hi>Isles.</hi> These are all who are reckoned up by <hi>Knox</hi> and <hi>Spotswood:</hi>

the Names of the Members of that Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly: But of all these 44, there were not above <hi>Nine,</hi> at most, who were called <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters</hi>; so that, at least, more than <hi>Thirty,</hi> were but <hi>Lay-Brethren</hi> according to the <hi>then</hi> way of <hi>Reckoning:</hi> probably, they were ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally such, if you speak in the <hi>Dialect,</hi> and reckon by the Measures of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church in all Ages.

                  <p>Whether our <hi>Scottish</hi> Reformers, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their Characters were, were of the present Presbyterian principles?

               </argument>
               <p>THis Enquiry, if I mistake not, is pretty far, in the interests of the main Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion: For, the <hi>Article,</hi> as I am apt to take it, aims at this, That our Reformation was carried on, with such a <hi>Dislike</hi> to <hi>Prelacy, or the Superiority of any Office in the Church, above Presbyters,</hi> as made <hi>Prelacy, or such a Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority, ever since, a great and insupportable Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance and Trouble to this Nation,</hi> &amp;c.

                  </gap> doth it, by <hi>fair Consequence.</hi> 'Tis as certain, our Presbyterian Brethren use, with confidence enough, to assert that our Reformers were of their Principles. This is <hi>One</hi> of the <hi>Main</hi> Arguments by which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101025:97"/>
they endeavour, on all occasions, to influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the Populace, and Gain Proselytes to their Party: And therefore I shall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to go as near to the bottom of this Matter as I can, and set it in its due Light; And I hope, It shall appear to be compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently Done, to all who shall, attentively and impartially, <hi>weigh</hi> the following Dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And</p>
               <p n="1">I. Let it be considered, That while our Reformation was on the <hi>Wheel,</hi> and for some years after its publick Establishment, there was no such Controversy agitated, in <hi>Europe,</hi> as this, concerning <hi>The Divine Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Parity or Imparity amongst the Pastors of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Popes</hi> pretended universal <hi>Headship</hi> was Called in Question, indeed; And, Called in Question, it was run down with all imaginable Reason, some years, before the Settlement of our Reformation. That Controversie was <hi>One</hi> of the <hi>First,</hi> which were accurately ventilated by the Patrons of Reformation. And it was very natural that it should have been so, considering what <hi>stress</hi> was <hi>laid</hi> upon it by the <hi>Pontificians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis likewise true, That the Corruptions of the Ecclesiastical Estate, were Enquired into, in most Provinces, every where, where the <hi>Truth</hi> began to <hi>Dawn,</hi> and the Reformation was Encouraged: And it was not to be imagined, but in such <hi>Scrutinies,</hi> Bishops would be taken notice of, for their
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101025:98"/>
general <hi>Defection</hi> from the Antient Rules and Measures of the Episcopal Office, and the vast Dissimilitude between them, and those of the same Order in the primitive times, both as to the <hi>Discharge</hi> of their <hi>Trust,</hi> and their <hi>Way</hi> of <hi>Living:</hi> And who doubts, but in these things the <hi>Popish</hi> Bishops were too generally culpable?</p>
               <p>'Tis farther true, That some Countries, when they reformed Religion, and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> did set up <hi>New Models</hi> of Government in the Churches they erected, as they thought their civil Constitutions could best bear them: And having once set them up, what wonder if they did what they could to justify them, and maintain their Lawfulness? Thus, for instance, Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> erected a <hi>Model</hi> of the <hi>Democratical Size</hi> at <hi>Geneva,</hi> because that State had then cast it self into a <hi>Democracy.</hi> And the Protestants in <hi>France,</hi> partly for Conveniency, partly in imitation of <hi>Calvins</hi> Platform, fell upon a method of governing their Churches without Bishops; And so it fared with some other Churches, as in <hi>Switzerland, &amp;c.</hi> while in the mean time other Churches thought it enough for them to Reform the Doctrine and Worship, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out altering the <hi>Ancient form</hi> of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But then</p>
               <p>'Tis as evident as any thing in History, that all this while, from the first Dawnings of the Reformation, I mean, till some years after the publick Establishment of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101025:98"/>
our Reformation, That there was no such Controversie insisted on, by <hi>Protestants,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their Debates with the <hi>Papists,</hi> or with one another, as that, about the <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Vnalterable Institution of parity or impari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> amongst the Pastors of the Church. And I dare confidently challenge my Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Brethren to produce any <hi>One Protestant Confession of Faith</hi> for their side of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion: Nay more, I dare challenge them to instance in any <hi>One Protestant Divine,</hi> of Note, who, in these times, maintained their side of the Controversy; who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd the <hi>Vnlawfulness</hi> of <hi>Imparity</hi> amongst Christian Pastors, before <hi>Theodore Beza</hi> did it, <hi>if he did it.</hi> Sure I am They cannot, without the greatest impudence, pretend that Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> (the only Transmarine Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, I can find, consulted by our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers about matters relating to our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation) was of their Principles, For whoso shall be pleased to consu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>It was No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but pride and ambition that intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the <hi>Popes</hi> Supremacy; That the Ancient Church, had, indeed her <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs</hi> and <hi>Primates,</hi> for the Expedition of Discipline, and the Preservation of Unity: As if, in the Kingdom of <hi>Poland</hi> one Archbishop should have the precedency of the rest of the Bishops, not that he might Tyrannize over them, but for Orders sake, and for Cherishing Unity amongst his Collegues and Brethren; And next to him there should be Provincial, or City Bishops for keeping all things orderly in the Church. <hi>Nature teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> (says he) <hi>that from every Colledge,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sleut hoc Natura di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctat, unum ex singulis Collegiis deligendum, cui praeeipua Cura in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbat.</note> 
                     <hi>One should be chosen who should have the chief Management of affairs.</hi> But, 'Tis another thing for one Man, as the <hi>Pope</hi> doth, to arrogate that to himself which exceeds all humane abilities; namely, The Power of governing the whole Universe.</q>
Whoso shall perpend these writings of Mr. <hi>Calvins,</hi> I say, shall find that he was very far from maintaining the <hi>Vnlawfulness</hi> of <hi>Prelacy.</hi> Nay, farther yet, I challenge my Presbyterian Brethren, upon their inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity to tell me, weither it was not a good many years after 1560. that <hi>Beza</hi> himself (the <hi>true founder</hi> of their <hi>Sect</hi>) condemn'd <hi>Prelacy, if he did condemn it.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:101025:99"/>I say, <hi>if he did maintain the Necessity of Parity, and condemn'd Prelacy</hi>; For however he may seem, upon several occasions, not only to give the preference to Presbyterian Government, and represent it as the most eligible, But to endeavour to found it on Scripture; And represent Episcopacy as an humane invention, yet I have not observed that, any where, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> calls it <hi>absolutely</hi> or <hi>sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Unlawful.</hi> On the contrary, he says in express terms,<note place="margin">Humanus Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus tolerabilis qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem esset, Modo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teres puri Canones, Impediendae Oligar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiae constituti, in u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum revocarentur.

               </p>
               <p>Sure I am, he was not for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating from a Church (as our modern Presbyterians are) upon the account of its Governments being <hi>Episcopal,</hi> as might be made appear fully from his Letters; so that whatever greater Degrees of <hi>Dislike</hi> to <hi>Episcopacy</hi> he may have discovered, beyond his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> yet it is not unreasonable to think, that his great <hi>aim</hi> was no more, than to justify the Constitution of the Church, he lived in; and recommend it as a pattern to other Churches.</p>
               <p>The Scope of this whole Consideration is this, That if what I have asserted is <hi>true</hi>; if there was no such Controversie agitated, all the time our Church was a Reforming, nor for a good many years after; Then we have one <hi>fair Presumption,</hi> that our <hi>Reformers</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:101025:100"/>
were not <hi>Presbyterians:</hi> It is not likely that they were for the <hi>Indispensibility</hi> of <hi>Parity,</hi> that being the <hi>side</hi> of a Question, which, in these times, was not begun to be <hi>tossed.</hi> And this <hi>Presumption</hi> will appear, yet, more <hi>pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous,</hi> if</p>
               <p n="2">II. It be considered, that we have no reason to believe, that our Reformers had any peculiar Motives, or Occasions, for adverting to the pretended Evils of <hi>Prelacy</hi>; or any peculiar interests to determine them for <hi>Parity,</hi> beyond other Churches; or that they were more sharp-sighted to espy faults in <hi>Prelacy,</hi> or had opportunities or inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to search more diligently, or enquire more narrowly, into these matters than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reformers. The truth is</p>
               <p>The Controversies about <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Worship,</hi> were the great ones which took up the thoughts of our Reformers, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed their most serious Applications. This is obvious to any who considers the accounts we have of them; so very obvious, that <hi>G. R.</hi> himself fairly confesses it in his <hi>First Vind. ad Quest.</hi> 1. where he tells us, <hi>That the Errors and Idolatry of that way</hi> (meaning Popery) <hi>were so gross, and of such immediate hazard to the Souls of People, That it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that our Reformers minded these First and Mainly, and thought it a great step to get these Removed; so that they took some more time to consult about the Reforming of the Government of the Church.</hi> From which, 'tis plain, he
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101025:100"/>
confesses, the Reformation of the Churches Government was not the subject of their <hi>Main Thinking</hi>; which indeed is very true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and cannot but appear to be so, to any who considers what a <hi>Lame</hi> Scheme was then <hi>drest</hi> up by them. But however this was, 'tis enough to my present purpose, That our Reformers were more imployed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Worship,</hi> than in thinking about Church <hi>Governments.</hi> From which, together with the former <hi>presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which was, that our present Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies were not begun to be agitated in these times, one of two things must follow unavoidably, <hi>viz.</hi> either 1. That if they were for the <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>indispensible Right</hi> of <hi>Parity,</hi> 'tis no great matter; their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is not much to be valued in a Question about which they had <hi>thought</hi> so Little; Or 2. That it is to be presumed, they were <hi>not</hi> for the <hi>Divine Right</hi> of <hi>Parity,</hi> That being the side of a Question, which was not then agitated in any Protestant Church, and as Little in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as any. To be ingenuous, I think both inferences good, tho 'tis only the <hi>Last</hi> I am concerned for at present. But this is not all, For</p>
               <p n="3">III. So far as my opportunities would allow me, I have had a special eye on all our <hi>Reformers,</hi> as I found them in our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories. I have noticed their sentiments about Church Government as carefully as I could; And I have not found so much as
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101025:101"/>
one amongst them, who hath either <hi>directly</hi> or <hi>indirectly,</hi> asserted the <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Vnalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Right</hi> of <hi>Parity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By our <hi>Reformers,</hi> here, I mean such as were either 1. <hi>Martyrs,</hi> or 2. <hi>Confessors</hi> for the Reformed Religion, before it had the countenance of Civil Authority, or 3. Such as lived when it was publickly established, and had a hand in bringing it to that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Such, I think, and such only, deserved the Name of our Reformers: And, here, again I dare be bold to challenge my Presbyterian Brethren, to adduce clear and plain proof that so much as any <hi>one man</hi> of the <hi>whole Number</hi> of our <hi>Reformers,</hi> was of the <hi>present</hi> principles of the <hi>party.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some of them, indeed, seem to have laid no great <hi>stress</hi> on <hi>Holy Orders,</hi> and to have been of opinion, That <hi>personal Gifts</hi> and <hi>Graces</hi> were a sufficient <hi>Call</hi> to any man to preach the Gospel; and undertake the pastoral Office. Thus that excellent person <hi>Mr. George Wishart,</hi> who, in most things, seems to have juster notions of the Gospel Spirit, than most of our other Reformers, when, at his Tryal, he was charged with this Article, <hi>That every man was a Priest, and that the Pope had no more power than another man,</hi> answered to this purpose,
<q>That <hi>St. Iohn saith of all Christians, He hath made us Kings and Priests.</hi> And <hi>St. Peter, He hath made us a Kingly Priesthood.</hi> That, therefore, any man skill'd in the Word of God, and true Faith of Christ, had power given
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101025:101"/>
him of God; But he that was unlearned, and not exercised in the word of God, nor constant in the Faith, whatever his state or order was, had no <hi>power</hi> to <hi>bind,</hi> or to <hi>loose,</hi> seeing he wanted the word of God, which is the <hi>Instrument</hi> of <hi>binding</hi> and <hi>loosing.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <note n="(p)" place="margin">Kn. 64.</note> And</p>
               <p>'Tis probable, This was a prevailing opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in those times, from the too common practice of it. But hath this any <hi>relation</hi> to the <hi>Divine Right</hi> of <hi>Parity?</hi> Doth it not <hi>strick</hi> equally against <hi>both Orders,</hi> that of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> as well as that of <hi>Bishops</hi>? Is it not plainly to set up the <hi>Ius Laicorum Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotale</hi> in opposition to both? And who can say but this <hi>Opinion</hi> might have been in a <hi>Breast,</hi> which entertain'd no <hi>scruples</hi> about the <hi>Lawfulness</hi> of <hi>Episcopacy</hi>? No doubt it might; and no doubt it was, actually, so with this same holy <hi>Martyr</hi>: For, he was not only willing that the <hi>then</hi> Bishops, tho <hi>Popish,</hi> should be his Judges; He not only gave them still their <hi>Titles,</hi> and payed them all the <hi>Respect</hi> that was <hi>Due</hi> to their <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Character</hi> (homages infinitely scandalous with our modern Presbyterians) as is to be observed thro all the steps of his Tryal: But in his last Exhortation to the People, at the very <hi>Stake,</hi> he bespake them thus; <note n="(q)" place="margin">Kn. 70.</note> 
                  <hi>I beseech you Brethren and Sisters, to exhort your Prelates to the Learning of the Word of God; that they may be ashamed to do evil, and learn to do good; and if they will not convert themselves from their wicked Errors, there shall hastily come
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101025:102"/>
upon them, the wrath of God which they shall not eschew.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here you see the <hi>Dying Martyr</hi> was ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, that the <hi>Popish Prelates</hi> might quit their <hi>Errors,</hi> not their <hi>Prelations.</hi> What is there here that looks like a <hi>Divine-Right-of-Parity-man</hi>? Indeed he was none of that <hi>Principle</hi>: He had had his Principles from <hi>England,</hi> as we shall find hereafter. Only one thing more about him, here; He was not for <hi>Club law</hi> Reformations: He was neither for violent Possessions of Churches, not for propagating the <hi>Cause</hi> by <hi>Rabbles,</hi> if we may belie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>Knox</hi>'s accounts of him.</p>
               <p>Others, again, of our Reformers, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd loudly against the Bishops of these times, and condemn'd them severely, and perhaps too deservedly: But what is this to the <hi>Order?</hi> Doth every man <hi>condemn</hi> the <hi>Office,</hi> who <hi>condemns</hi> this or that <hi>Officer</hi>? If so, then, sure, the <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Presbyters</hi> was as bad as the <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Bishops,</hi> in the judgment of our Reformers; For instance, hear <hi>Walter Milne</hi> in his Exhortation to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, at his Martyrdom: <hi>Therefore as ye would</hi>

No, but of the whole collection of) <hi>the Priests, Abbots, Monks, Friars, Priors, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and the rest of the Sect of Antichrist.</hi> But 'tis needless to adduce the Testimonies of private persons: we have the publick <hi>Deeds</hi> of the <hi>Protestants</hi> of these times, very clear to this purpose.

                  <note n="(s)" place="margin">Kn. 146.</note> And were not <hi>Presbyters</hi> of the number of these <hi>Shavelings</hi>? And what can be more part to this purpose than the <hi>Supplication</hi> which was presented by our Reformers to the Parliament, <hi>Anno</hi> 1560? There they tell the Estates, <hi>That they cannot cease to crave of their Honours, the Redress of such Enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as manifestly are, and of a long time have been committed by the Place-holders of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, and others of the Clergy— They offer evidently to prove, that, in all the Rabble of the Clergy, there is not one Lawful Minister— And therefore they crave, that they may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned unworthy of Honour, Authority, Charge, or Care, in the Church of God, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:101025:103"/>I have insisted the more largely on these things, because, I know, People are apt to mistake in this matter, who do not sufficiently attend to the <hi>Dialect</hi> of these <hi>times</hi>; Especially when they read the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story which is commonly called <hi>Iohn Knox</hi>'s.

               </p>
               <p>The Author of the <hi>Course of Conformity</hi> in his 4<hi>th Chap.</hi> reckons up a full <hi>Dozen</hi> of such as (he says) gave <hi>Evident and full Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> against <hi>Bishoprie,</hi> as he calls it.

               </p>
               <p>All the rest he proves to have been enemies to <hi>Prelacy,</hi> by this one Argument: <hi>They preached zealously against Popery, And Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprie is one of the greatest Errors and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of that.</hi> He neither offers at <hi>proving</hi> his <hi>Subsumption,</hi> nor at adducing any other To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick: And has he not proven the point demonstratively?

               <p>Mr. <hi>Petrie</hi> mentions only two of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, as <hi>Divine Right-of Parity Men:</hi> The <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Murray,</hi> who was <hi>Regent,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Knox: Calderwood</hi> insists on <hi>Knox,</hi> but doth not mention <hi>Murray.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Petries</hi> Evidence about <hi>Murray,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pet. 366.</note> is, <hi>That he hath read of him, that by his Letter, he did inform Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>of the Honor and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness

that would attend her Crown and State, upon the Establishment of Christs Government; And of the profitable Vses whereunto the Rich Benefices of Bishops might be applied.</hi> But I. He tells not in what Author he read this; And none who knows Mr. <hi>Petries Byass,</hi> will think it unreasonable to <hi>require</hi> some other thing to <hi>rely</hi> on, than his own <hi>Bare Authority.</hi> 2. If we should <hi>rest</hi> on his <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> and allow that <hi>Murray</hi> wrote so, because Mr. <hi>Petrie</hi> said it, yet how will it follow, that his Lordship was for the <hi>Divine Right</hi> of <hi>Parity?</hi> Might not he have been against the Temporal Dignities, and the rich Benefices of the <hi>English</hi> Bishops, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being against <hi>Prelacy?</hi> How many have been so? Indeed 3. There is all the Reason in the world to believe, That if <hi>Murray</hi> did write so to the <hi>English Queen,</hi> this was all he <hi>aim'd</hi> at: For, had he been for the <hi>Divine Right</hi> of <hi>Parity,</hi> would he ever have so much countenanced <hi>Imparity</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland?</hi> Was not he one of the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribers</hi> of the <hi>First Book of Discipline</hi>? <note n="(y)" place="margin">Kn. 283. Spot. 175.</note> wherein <hi>Imparity</hi> was so formally established? Was not he <hi>Regent</hi> in <hi>December</hi> 1567? And did not he, then, give the <hi>Royal Assent</hi> to some Acts of Parliament, made clearly in <hi>favour</hi> of Imparity? Or did he extend the <hi>Royal Assent</hi> to these Acts in <hi>Despight</hi> of his <hi>Conscience</hi>?</p>
               <p>'Tis true, indeed, Time has been, when <hi>some Men</hi> have had such <hi>Ductile</hi> Consciences, that <hi>picq't,</hi> the one year, for not having so

much favour at <hi>Court,</hi> as they thought they deserved, they could boldly stand up in Parliaments against <hi>iniquous Laws,</hi> and tell their fellow Members, That <hi>such Laws</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on the <hi>Iustice</hi> of the Nation, and what not? And yet, the next year, when the <hi>Court</hi> smiled on them, and gave them Preferments and Pensions to satisfy their Ambition, or their Avarice, they could retract all their former <hi>Niceness,</hi> so much, that if they had got the management of the <hi>Royal Assent,</hi> they would have made no scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to have <hi>Applied</hi> it for the <hi>Ratification, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,</hi> and <hi>perpetual Confirmation</hi> of the <hi>same</hi> Laws, in their whole <hi>Heads, Articles</hi> and <hi>Clauses,</hi> which seemed, to themselves, so <hi>scandalous</hi> and <hi>wicked</hi>: But the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Murray,</hi> while <hi>Regent,</hi> had no such tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: I believe he had no such <hi>yielding</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; if he had, I don't think his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was much to be valued. Once more, I think 'tis very strange that he should have been for the <hi>Divine Right</hi> of <hi>Parity,</hi> and yet should never have spoken so much <hi>out,</hi> considering his occasions, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in his private Letters to Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The only person now to be considered is <hi>Iohn Knox.</hi> He was certainly a <hi>prime</hi> instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Advancement of our Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: His Authority was great, and his Sentiments were very influential; And it is not to be denied, but it is of some weight in the present question, to know what was his judgment. I shall therefore endeavour
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101025:105"/>
to account for his principles a little more fully; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> shall do it by these steps. 1. I shall shew the insufficiency of the arguments that are adduced, by our Brethren, to prove him Presbyterian. 2. I shall adduce the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which incline me to think he was not.</p>
               <p>The great Argument insisted on by the Author of the <hi>Course of Conformity,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Petrie,</hi> 
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Course of Conform.</hi> p. 32. Pet. 375.</note> is taken from a Letter of <hi>Knox</hi>'s, directed to the General Assembly, holden at <hi>Stirling,</hi> in <hi>August</hi> 1571. The words are these. <hi>Vnfaithful and Traitors to the Flocks shall ye be, before the Lord</hi> Jesus, <hi>if that, with your consent, directly or indirectly, ye suffer unworthy men to be thrust in within the Ministry of the Kirk, under what pretence that ever it be: Remember the Iudge before whom ye must make an Account, and resist that TY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RANNY as ye would avoid Hell fire</hi>: So the Author of the <hi>Course of Conformity,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the least attempt to let the world see where the Argument lay. Mr. <hi>Petrie</hi> is indeed a little more discreet. He tells us where it lies: <hi>Iohn Knox in his Letter to the Assembly, by the word</hi> Tyranny <hi>meaneth</hi> Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy: So he, but without any fuller de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction. And is not this a Demonstration, that <hi>Knox</hi> was Presbyterian? And yet, after all this, it is not possible to make more of the Letter, when it is narrowly consider'd than,
<q>That <hi>Knox</hi> deem'd it a pernicious and Tyrannical thing, for any person or persons whatsoever to thrust unworthy men into the Ministery of the Church;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101025:105"/>
and Ministers who would make Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their Calling and Trust, must resist such encroachments with all possible concern and courage. No man, I say, can make more of the Letter:</q>
And who doubts but Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> was so far in the right? But then, let any man who looks not through <hi>Mr. Petries</hi> Spectacles, tell me what this has to do with <hi>Parity</hi> or <hi>Imparity</hi>?</p>
               <p>The next argument is insisted on both by <hi>Petrie</hi> and <hi>Calderwood</hi>: <note n="(b)" place="margin">Pet. 55. Cald. 374.</note>
                  <q>It is, that <hi>Knox</hi> was at <hi>St. Andrews,</hi> in <hi>Feb.</hi> 1571/2, when <hi>Douglas</hi> was advanced to that <hi>See</hi>; That he refused to <hi>inaugurate</hi> him; Nay that in the Audience of many then present, he denounced <hi>Anathema</hi> to the <hi>Giver,</hi> and <hi>Anathema</hi> to the <hi>Receiver</hi>; And if you ask <hi>Calderwoods</hi> Evidence for this, he tells you, He found it in a <hi>certain Manuscript,</hi> than which what can be more Apode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick?</q>
To be short, tho we had reason to give credit to <hi>Calderwood,</hi> and his uncertain <hi>Certain Manuscript,</hi> and to believe that the Matter of Fact is true, and that <hi>Knox</hi> said and did so; yet, by what consequences will it follow, that he was for the <hi>Divine Right</hi> of <hi>Parity?</hi> To deal frankly, 'tis like enough that <hi>Knox</hi> said so, and 'tis very probable he had reason to say so, in that instance: For at that time dreadful Invasions were made upon the <hi>Patrimony</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>; None more <hi>deep</hi> in that <hi>Iniquity</hi> than the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Morton,</hi> then <hi>Chancellor</hi>; by whose influence <hi>Douglas</hi> was preferred to that <hi>Archbishoprick</hi>:
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101025:106"/>
And so 'tis like enough that <hi>Knox,</hi> who, all his life was singularly <hi>Zealous</hi> for the <hi>Rights</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> upon suspicion, if not certain knowledge, of some <hi>dirty Bargain</hi> between <hi>Morton</hi> and <hi>Douglas,</hi> expressed suitable Resentments. But that it was not from any perswasion he had of the <hi>Unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi> of <hi>Prelacy</hi> is clear, even from what <hi>Calderwood</hi> and <hi>Petrie</hi> themselves have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, within a <hi>pag.</hi> or <hi>two</hi> 
                  <note n="(c)" place="margin">Cald. 57. Pet. 875.</note> For both tell us, that when the next Assembly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued <hi>Douglas</hi> in the <hi>Rectorate</hi> of the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity</hi> of <hi>St. Andrews,</hi> a <hi>Station</hi> he had been in before he was raised to the <hi>Archbishoprick; Iohn Knox Regrated that so many Offices were laid on one Old Man, which scarcely</hi> 20 <hi>of the best gifts were able to bear.</hi> For (as <hi>Petrie</hi> adds) <hi>He was now Archbishop, Rector of the Vniversity, and Provost of the New College of St. Andrews.</hi> From this, I say, it is plain, That <hi>Knox</hi> did not resent <hi>Douglas</hi> his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement, from any opinion of the <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulness</hi> of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> for no such word, so much as once mutter'd by him; but from a perswasion he had, that no one man was fit for such a Multitude of Offices. And I shall readily grant, that <hi>Knox</hi> was not for <hi>Largo Diocesses</hi> (such as <hi>St. Andrews</hi> was then), as we shall learn by and by, tho I am afraid, little to the comfort of my Presbyterian Brethren. But I have not yet dispatched the whole Argument; 'Tis said, <hi>He refused to inaugurate the Bishop</hi>: Be it so, but may not the grounds I have laid down already,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101025:106"/>
make it reasonable for him to have done so, tho he had no quarrel with <hi>imparity</hi>? What ane Argument is this, <hi>Iohn Knox, a Presbyter, refused to consecrate a Bishop,</hi> Ergo <hi>he was a Presbyterian</hi>? This is upon the supposition, that <hi>Calderwood</hi> and Mr. <hi>Petrie</hi> have told us true Matter of Fact: And yet I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, I see not the probability of its being true, That <hi>Knox</hi> was desired to <hi>inaugurate</hi> him: For how is it imaginable, that he would be desired to perform that Office, when there was a <hi>Bishop</hi> and a <hi>Superintendent</hi> at hand to do it, and who actually did it, as both Authors acknowledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But that is not all.</p>
               <p>There is another Argument insisted on by both Authors, <note n="(d)" place="margin">Cald. 56. Pet. 375.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> That Mr. <hi>Iohn Ruther-foord, Provost of the Old College alledged, that Mr.</hi> Knox<hi>'s repining proceeded from Male-Contentment,</hi> And <hi>Knox purged himself, next Sunday, saying I have refused a greater Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, than ever it was, which I might have had with the favour of greater men than he hath his; I did and do Repine for Discharge of my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</hi> Now, what more is there in all this than, That <hi>Knox</hi> his Conscience would not have allowed him to take a Bishoprick, with so much prejudice to the Rights of the Church, for any mans <hi>feud</hi> or <hi>favour,</hi> as he suspected <hi>Douglas</hi> had done in compliance with the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Morton</hi>? Can the world see any thing here that lookt like the <hi>Divine Right of Parity</hi>? But</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:101025:107"/>
                  <hi>Calderwood</hi> has yet a more wonderful Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument <note n="(e)" place="margin">Cald. 57.</note> to prove Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> one of his party: <hi>Mr. Beza,</hi> forsooth, <hi>being informed by Mr.</hi> Knox, <hi>as appeareth, of the Intention of the Court to introduce Bishops, wrote a Letter to him, wherein he told him, That as Bishops brought in the Papacy, so false Bishops, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks of Popery, would bring in Epicurism to the world, and therefore prayed him, that Episcopacy might never be re-admitted into</hi> Scotland, <hi>&amp;c. Petrie</hi> indeed mentions the same Letter, but he had not the courage, it seems, to say, that it appeared to have been occasioned by a Letter of <hi>Knox</hi>'s to <hi>Beza,</hi> concerning the intentions of the Court to introduce Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy. Indeed no such thing appeareth from any sentence, phrase, or syllable, in all Mr. <hi>Beza</hi>'s Letter: How it came to <hi>appear</hi> to Mr. <hi>Calderwood,</hi> whether by some <hi>certain</hi> or <hi>uncertain Manuscript</hi> I know not; but however it was, make the supposition, That <hi>Knox</hi> did write so to <hi>Beza,</hi> where is the consequence of the Argument? And if he wrote not (and 'tis impossible to make it appear from Mr. <hi>Beza</hi>'s Letter that he did) Why was <hi>Calderwood</hi> at such pains to give the world a citation out of <hi>Beza</hi>'s Letter against Episcopacy? was that a good proof that <hi>Knox</hi> was <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> that <hi>Beza</hi> sent him such a Letter? The truth is, if any thing can be collected from that Letter, concerning <hi>Knox</hi>'s sentiments, it seems rather, that he was for <hi>Prelacy.</hi> For <hi>Beza</hi> seems clearly to import, that <hi>Knox</hi> needed to be

So much for the Arguments insisted on to prove, that Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> was for <hi>Parity.</hi> I come now to the Arguments which incline me to think he was not.</p>
               <p>When we are enquiring after ones senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments about a point in controversie, It is not reasonable to build much on far fetcht consequences; or refine upon incidental sayings, which may be, very frequently, the Results of Negligence or Inadvertency: It is not proper to fasten on indirect pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, or snatch at this or that indelibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated phrase or expression, which might have dropt unwarily from his tongue or pen. Following such measures, we may easily strain mens words, beyond their meaning; and make them speak Nonsense, or innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Contradictions when we have a mind for it. The solid measure is to weigh a mans deliberate and serious thoughts, if, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny where, he has exprest them; To consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Reasonings, when he treated direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the controverted Subjects, or any
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:101025:108"/>
thing that stands so nearly related to it, that one cannot readily discourse the one, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reflecting on the other; To trace him through his life, if the controverted point is Relative to Practice, and try what was his Behaviour, when he had occasion to declare his mind concerning the matter in question. This, as I take it, is the <hi>true Rule.</hi> Now allowing this <hi>Rule</hi> to take place, I am very much mistaken if <hi>Knox</hi> shall be found to have been for the <hi>Divine Institution of Parity,</hi> and the <hi>Vnlawfulness</hi> of <hi>Prelacy.</hi>

of <hi>Popery</hi> in his conference with Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> recorded in his History <note n="(o)" place="margin">Kn. 318.</note>. One other Testimony to this purpose I cannot forbear to transcribe; All that know any thing of the History of our Reformation, must be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd to know, That <hi>Superintendency</hi> was Erected by Mr. <hi>Knox</hi>'s his special advice and counsel. That it was in its very <hi>height, Anno</hi> 1566, is as indubitable: Now, we are told that <hi>Knox</hi> wrote the 4<hi>th Book</hi> of his <hi>History,</hi> that year. Hear him, therefore, in his Introduction to it. <note n="(p)" place="margin">Kn. 308. Cald. 401</note> 
                  <hi>We can speak the Truth, whomsoever we offend; There is no Realm that hath the Sacraments in like Purity: For all others, how sincere that ever the Doctrine be, that by some is taught, Retain in their Churches, and in the Ministers thereof, some Footsteps of Antichrist and Dregs of Popery. But we (all Praise to God alone) have Nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our Churches that ever flowed from that Man of Sin.</hi> Let any man judge, now if Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> lookt upon <hi>imparity</hi> as a <hi>Dreg</hi> of <hi>Popery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we have found <hi>Knox,</hi> when he had the fairest occasions, the strongest tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the most awakening calls, when it was most seasonable for him, to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared for the <hi>Divine Right</hi> of <hi>Parity,</hi> and the <hi>Vnlawfulness</hi> of <hi>Prelacy,</hi> still silent in the matter; or rather, on all occasions, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding on <hi>suppositions,</hi> and reasoning from <hi>principles</hi> fairly allowing the Lawfulness of Prelacy.

And Nature, in this, is fully justified by Experience: For what <hi>Scottish</hi> man knows not, that, when the late Revolution was a carrying on, as <hi>England</hi> cast the Copy to <hi>Scotland,</hi> so it was used and prest, as one of the most popular and influential Topicks to perswade the <hi>Scots</hi> to follow the Copy, That <hi>England</hi> had done it; and why should <hi>Scotland</hi> follow a separate Course?

to so honourable ane <hi>issue.</hi> And 'tis plain, the <hi>English Faction</hi> had reason to be as glad, for they had gained two points: They had got <hi>Albany</hi> to understand the temper of the Nation, and the weakness of the <hi>French interest</hi>: And they had treated the <hi>Scots,</hi> who were so averse from Fighting, so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly, by shunning all occasions of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging, and thereby shewing that they were no Enemies to the <hi>Scots,</hi> unless it was on the <hi>French account,</hi> that they could not have fallen on a more successful politick for Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing King <hi>Henry</hi>'s great purpose, which was, To disengage the <hi>Scots</hi> of the <hi>French,</hi> as much as he could: And the Success was agreeable.

so soon as he heard that <hi>Iames</hi> was dead, and had left a <hi>Daughter,</hi> some few days old, yet <hi>Heiress</hi> of the Crown, He dispatched them for <hi>Scotland,</hi> to promote his interests, in the Matter of the Match, he was zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to have made, betwixt his Son Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> and our <hi>Infant</hi> Soveraign. Indeed they were as diligent as he could have desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: They got it carried in Parliament; and that they did it from a prospect of carrying on the Reformation of Religion, by that conjunction, cannot be doubted, if we may believe Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> in his Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the History of the Reformation of the Church of <hi>England</hi>: For there <note n="(e)" place="margin">Burn. 279, 280.</note> he not only tells,

And a little after, They were sent home, and went away much pleased both with the Splendor of the Kings Court, and with the <hi>way of Religion</hi> which they had seen in <hi>England.</hi> And that we have reason to believe this Author in this matter, is evident, because

he is justified, herein, by all our Historians, especially <hi>Buchanan,</hi> as my appear by the sequel.

               <p>They were so strong, that they carried the <hi>Regency</hi> for the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Arran,</hi> prompted thereto, chiefly by the perswasion they had of his affection to the Reformation, as is evident from the consentient Accounts of <hi>Buchanan, Knox,</hi> and <hi>Spotswood.</hi>

               <p>Observe further, by the way, That this first Parliament of Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s, was holden, in her name, and by her Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, upon the 13th of <hi>March</hi> 1542/3, as is clear, not only from our Historians, but, the printed Acts of Parliament; and she was not crowned till the 20th of <hi>August</hi> thereafter, if we may believe both <hi>Lesly</hi> and <hi>Buchanan</hi>

               <p>Such was the strength of the Reforming Party, then, and this strength, under God, advanced so far, principally, by <hi>English in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences.</hi> And all this will appear more convincing still, when it is considered in the 6th place, That all alongst the <hi>Popish Clergy</hi> were very sensible of it, and very much offended with it, and were at all imaginable pains to disappoint it, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it.

               <p n="8">8. When <hi>Edward</hi> died, and his Sister <hi>Mary</hi> ascended the Throne, a heavy Cloud indeed did hang over both Nations, and threatned a dreadful storm to the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Religion. <hi>Mary,</hi> according to

her surly humour, fell to downright Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution in <hi>England:</hi> And our <hi>Q.

And now the purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christianity, seem'd to be brought to a lamentable stand, in both Kingdoms, and the hopes of those to be quite dasht, who were breathing for the profession of that Holy Religion in its purity.
<q>Yet God, in his kind providence, did other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise dispose of things, and made that a means to advance Religion amongst us, which, men thought, should have utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extinguisht it: For some of those who fled from <hi>Mary</hi>'s persecution in <hi>England,</hi> taking their Refuge into this Kingdom, did not only help to keep the light which had begun to shine, but made the Sun to break up more clear than before, as <hi>Spotswood</hi> hath it from <hi>Knox.</hi>

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:101025:126"/>
sent us <hi>Harlaw, Willock</hi> and <hi>Knox,</hi> by his special providence, as I told just now) were quite cut off all the time of <hi>Mary</hi>'s Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Our Reformers, therefore, to make the <hi>best</hi> of a <hi>bad</hi> hand, were earnest to be amongst the foremost Courtiers with the Queen Regent: They were ready to serve her design with all possible frankness: par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, they were amongst the most for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for carrying on the <hi>Match</hi> with the <hi>Dauphine</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and voted chearfully that he should have the <hi>Matrimonial Crown</hi> conferred upon him, after the solemnizati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Marriage. In consequence of this their frankness, the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Argyle</hi> and the <hi>Prior</hi> of <hi>St. Andrews,</hi> two first-rate Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, were the persons nominated to pass into <hi>France,</hi> to honour the <hi>Dauphine</hi> with that complement: And they undertook it cordially.</p>
               <p>But, in the very instant, almost, they were informed that <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>England</hi> was dead, and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> on the Throne, and withal professing Protestancy. This altered their whole <hi>Scheme:</hi> They presently considered, The <hi>English Influences,</hi> so long <hi>stopt</hi> in their Courses, might now begin to <hi>Drop</hi> again: And there were hopes of Assistance from that <hi>Female</hi> Soveraign: So, these two Lords (no doubt, with the advice of the rest of the fraternity) gave over thoughts of their <hi>French Voyage:</hi> The <hi>Dauphine</hi> might purchase a <hi>Crown</hi> for himself, or wait till his <hi>Father</hi> dyed, if he could not do better: They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:101025:127"/>
to carry him no <hi>Matrimonial Crowns</hi> from <hi>Scotland.</hi> Indeed their hopes of As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance from <hi>England</hi> to carry on the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of Religion, were better ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>then</hi> than ever. For,</p>
               <p>Upon the Death of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> by <hi>French</hi> advice, our <hi>Queen,</hi> as <hi>Next Heir</hi> to that <hi>Crown,</hi> had assumed the <hi>English Titles.</hi> 'Tis not to be thought <hi>Elizabeth</hi> lik'd this well; and resolving to continue <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> she had no reason: For who knows not that her <hi>Title</hi> was <hi>Questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable?</hi> But our Queens <hi>Descent</hi> was <hi>Vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted.</hi> What wonder then if <hi>Elizabeth</hi> thought herself concerned to secure herself as well as she could? And what more fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible and proper way for her security, than to have the <hi>Affections,</hi> and by consequence the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> on her side? And what measure so natural for obtaining <hi>that,</hi> as to cherish the Reformation of Religion in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and weaken the <hi>Popish,</hi> and by consequence, the <hi>French</hi> interests there, and get the <hi>Rule</hi> of that Kingdom put in the hands of <hi>Protestants</hi>? The politick was obviously solid; all the work was to set it a going: But that difficulty was soon over; for no sooner did she employ some private instruments, to try the <hi>Scottish</hi> pulses, than they <hi>smelt</hi> the matter, and <hi>relisht</hi> it imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately. The least intimation that she was so inclined, was to them as a spark of fire amongst Gun-powder, it kindled them in a <hi>thought</hi>: They addrest her, quickly
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:101025:127"/>
beg'd her protection, and plighted their Faith that they would depend upon her, and stand by her, and to the outmost of their power, secure her interests; if she would grant them suitable assistances. Thus the bargain was readily agreed to on both sides; and both perform'd their parts suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessfully. For who knows not that our Reformation was carried on by <hi>Elizabeths Auspices?</hi> by <hi>English</hi> Arms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Counsels, and Money in the year 1560? And who knows not, that by the <hi>Treaty</hi> at <hi>Leith</hi> in <hi>Iuly,</hi> that same year, after the <hi>French</hi> were expelled <hi>Scotland,</hi> when our Reformers, by her help, had got the upper hand, her Crown was secured, as far as the <hi>Scottish</hi> Protestants could secure it? Who knows not, I say, that it was one of the <hi>Articles</hi> of that <hi>Treaty, That the</hi> Queen <hi>of</hi> Scotland <hi>and</hi> King <hi>of</hi> France, <hi>should not, thereafter, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surp the Titles of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>and should delete the Arms of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Ireland <hi>out of their</hi> Scutchions? <hi>and whole Houshold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuff?</hi>

               <p n="10">10. Then, It is considerable that some of our <hi>Chief Luminaries,</hi> of <hi>those,</hi> who had a principal hand in preaching and planting the Gospel in Purity among us, had drunk in these principles in <hi>England,</hi> and brought them, thence, to <hi>Scotland</hi> with them. Thus
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:101025:128"/>
the excellent Martyr Mr. <hi>George Wishart,</hi> (of whom in part before) as <hi>Spotswood</hi> tells us, <note n="(t)" place="margin">Spot. 76.</note> had spent his time in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and return'd to his own Country to promote the Truth in it, <hi>Anno</hi> 1544. And Mr. <hi>Iohn Spotswood,</hi> that worthy man who was so long <hi>Superintendent</hi> of <hi>Lothian</hi> after our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, was one of <hi>Cranmers Disciples,</hi> as you may see in the beginning of the <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Archbishop Spotswood</hi> his Son, and also in his History. <note n="(u)" place="margin">Spot. 344.</note> And <hi>Iohn Willock</hi> and <hi>William Harlaw</hi> had both lived in <hi>England,</hi> before they preacht in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as I have already accounted; and perhaps a strict Enquiry might discover some others.</p>
               <p n="11">11. and lastly, On the other hand, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept so far as <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> was <hi>Calvinist,</hi> and a Lover of the <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>Geneva,</hi> for which, perhaps, I shall account hereafter) none of our Historians give so much as one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar instance, of a <hi>Scottish</hi> Reformer who had his Education in any other <hi>foreign</hi> Church, except Mr. <hi>Patrick Hamilton,</hi> who, I think, cannot be proven to have been a <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>; and tho it could be done, it could amount to no more than the Authority of a very young man, considering he was but 23 years of age when he died. Neither do they mention any <hi>Foreigner,</hi> who came here to <hi>Scotland,</hi> to assist us in our Reformation: <hi>Lesly,</hi> 
                  <note n="(v)" place="margin">Lesl. 492.</note> indeed, says, that the <hi>Scottish</hi> Protestants sent Letters and Messengers to <hi>Germany,</hi> to call thence <hi>Sacramentarian</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, as being very dexterous at fostering
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:101025:128"/>
Sedition, and subverting Religion; but no other Historian says so; and he himself says not that ever any such came to <hi>Scotland.</hi> Thus, I think, I have accounted compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently for the first thing proposed, <hi>viz.</hi> That our Reformation, under God, was principally Cherished and Encouraged by <hi>English Influences,</hi> I proceed to the</p>
               <p n="2">2. Which was, That, in <hi>Correspondence</hi> to these <hi>Influences,</hi> our Reformers were generally of the same <hi>Mind</hi> with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> in several momentous instances relating to the Constitution and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Government and Polity of the Church, wherein, our present <hi>Presbyterian</hi> principles stand in direct opposition and contradiction to <hi>her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That our Reformers agreed with those of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in the Common <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> in their <hi>Creed,</hi> was never called in Question. But it is not my present purpose to consider the sentiments of our Reformers in relation to the <hi>Church</hi> as it is a <hi>Sect,</hi> but as it is a <hi>Society,</hi> neither shall I be curious to amuse many particulars; I shall content my self with two or three of considerable weight and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. And<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Our Reformers, generally, or rather, unanimously, lookt on the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as a Church so well constituted, that her <hi>Communion</hi> was a <hi>Lawful Communion.</hi> For this we have two as good Evidences as the nature of the thing is capable of, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:101025:129"/>
The constant and uniform practice of our Reformers <hi>joining</hi> in the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> when they had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, as those of the Church of <hi>England</hi> did, with the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi>; and their <hi>open profession</hi> in their <hi>publick deeds</hi> that they thought it <hi>Lawful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. I say it was the <hi>constant practice</hi> of our Reformers to <hi>joyn</hi> in the <hi>Communion</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> when they had occasion, as those of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> did, with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Thus, we find all such of our Reformers, as, in times of Persecution, fled into <hi>England,</hi> still <hi>joyning</hi> with the Church of <hi>England</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> e. g. <hi>Friar Alexander Seaton,</hi>

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:101025:130"/>
Questioned if he had preached any, since he came to <hi>England</hi>? Answered he had preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed none: But in some places where godly people were Assembled, He had read the <hi>Prayers of the Communion Book set forth in the Reign of King</hi> Ed.

Question'd again, what his Judgment was of that <hi>Book?</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, <hi>He approved it, as agreeing in all points with the word of God</hi>; And so suffered Martyrdom. I think this man was neither for <hi>Parity,</hi> nor against <hi>Liturgies.</hi> But to proceed.</p>
               <p>The excellent <hi>Mr. Wishart,</hi> as he had spent some time in <hi>England</hi> (as was told before) so, it seems, he returned to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> of <hi>English</hi> (I am confident, not of <hi>Presbyterian</hi>) <hi>Principles</hi>: For, he was not only for the Lawfulness of <hi>Private Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> as appeared by his practice; but <hi>Knox</hi> 
                  <note n="(k)" place="margin">Kn: Hist. 69.</note> gives us fair intimations, that he mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred it by a <hi>Set-form.</hi> I know <hi>King Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>'s Liturgy was not then composed: But it is not to be imagined, That the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers in <hi>England,</hi> in <hi>Wishart</hi>'s time admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred the Sacrament without a <hi>Set-form.</hi> The <hi>Extemporary Spirit</hi> was not, then, in <hi>vogue</hi>: And why, else, could Sir <hi>Iohn Borthwick</hi> have been charged with the <hi>Great Heresy</hi> of <hi>Commending</hi> the <hi>English Liturgy</hi>? However, I shall not be peremptory, because I have not the opportunity of enquiring, at present, what <hi>Forms</hi> the <hi>English Reformers</hi> had, <hi>then.</hi> All I shall say, is, if they had a <hi>Liturgy,</hi> 'tis very probable, <hi>Wishart</hi> used it; For, as
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:101025:130"/>
                  <hi>Knox</hi> tells us, when he celebrated the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist, before his Execution,
<q>After he had blessed the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> he took the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Brake</hi> it, and gave to every one of it, bidding each of them, <hi>Remember that Christ had died for them, and feed on it spiritually</hi>; so taking the Cup, he bade them <hi>Remember that Christs Blood was shed for them,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
So <hi>Knox,</hi> word for word, which account, I think, seems fairly to intimate, that <hi>Wishart</hi> used a <hi>Form,</hi> but if he did, what other could it be than <hi>such</hi> as he had learned in <hi>England</hi>?</p>
               <p>I have accounted already how <hi>Iohn Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock</hi> and <hi>William Harlaw</hi> had served in the <hi>English Church,</hi> before they came to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> 
                  <note n="(l)" place="margin">Spot. 93.</note> I might perhaps make a fuller Collection: But what needs more?</p>
               <p>Even <hi>Knox</hi> himself lived in <hi>Communion</hi> with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> all the time he was in that Kingdom: He went not there to keep Conventicles, to erect <hi>Altar</hi> against <hi>Altar,</hi> to <hi>gather Churches</hi> out of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> to set up separate and schismatical Churches, as some of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Parity-men have sometimes done: No, he preached in the publick Churches, and, in subordination to the Bishops; and he preached before King <hi>Edward</hi> himself, as he himself tell us, in his <hi>Admonition to the Professors of the Truth in</hi> England; <note n="(m)" place="margin">p. 52.</note> which, it is very improbable, he would have been allowed to have done, if he had <hi>Condemned</hi> the Communion of the Church
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:101025:131"/>
of <hi>England,</hi> as it was <hi>then</hi> established: For who knows not, that, in King <hi>Edwards</hi> time, all <hi>Schism</hi> and <hi>Non-Conformity</hi> were sufficiently discouraged? And, through that whole <hi>Admonition,</hi> he, still, speaks of himself as <hi>One</hi> of the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the <hi>Church of England.</hi> Nay</p>
               <p>If it be <hi>Reasonable</hi> to <hi>Collect</hi> mens <hi>Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> from their <hi>Reasonings,</hi> I am sure, in that same <hi>Admonition</hi> I have enough for my purpose: For, he reasons upon suppositions, and from Principles, which, clearly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned <hi>Separation</hi> from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as <hi>then</hi> established. For, when he gives his thoughts of that fatal Discord which happened between the two great men (<hi>Somerset,</hi> and the <hi>Admiral,</hi> as I take it) He discourses thus; <hi>God compelled my tongue</hi> (says he) <hi>openly to declare, That the Devil and his Ministers</hi> (the Papists) <hi>Intended only the Subversion of Gods true Religion, by that Mortal Hatred amongst those who ought to have been, most assuredly, Knit together by Christian Charity— And especially that the wicked and envious Papists (by that ungodly Breach of Charity) diligently minded the overthrow of him</hi> (Somerset) <hi>that, to his own Destruction, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the Death of his innocent friend</hi> (and Brother)— <hi>All this trouble was devised, by the Devil and his instruments, to stop and lett Christ's Disciples and their poor Boat</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Church.) What can be more plain (I say) than, that <hi>Knox,</hi> here, proceeds on suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, and reasons from Principles, which
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:101025:131"/>
condemned <hi>Separation</hi> from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as then established? Doth he not suppose, that the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as then established, was Christ's <hi>Boat,</hi> his Church? And that the <hi>Sons</hi> of the <hi>Church of England</hi> were <hi>Christ's Disciples</hi>? Doth he not suppose, that these two Brothers, as <hi>Sons</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ought to have been <hi>assuredly knit</hi> together, by <hi>Christian Charity</hi>? That the <hi>Breach</hi> between them was ane <hi>ungodly Breach</hi> of <hi>that Charity,</hi> by which, Members of that <hi>same Church</hi> ought to have been <hi>assuredly knit together</hi>?

               <p>By the aforementioned Letter, you see, <hi>The Lords</hi> of the <hi>Congregation,</hi> referr'd it to the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of the <hi>English Council,</hi> to <hi>foresee and devise the Means and Assurances)</hi> they are the very words of the Letter) how ane effectual <hi>Confederacy</hi> might be made, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, for <hi>Gods Cause.</hi> Now let us reason a little upon the common <hi>principles</hi> of <hi>prudence,</hi> where <hi>Matter of Fact</hi> is so <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What was more natural for the <hi>English Council</hi> to <hi>Require,</hi> than, that (now that the <hi>English</hi> Reformation was perfected and legally established, and the <hi>Scottish</hi> was only in forming) the <hi>Scots</hi> should engage to transcribe the <hi>English</hi> Copy, and establish their Reformation upon that same <hi>foot, i. e.</hi> receive the <hi>Doctrine, Worship, Rites</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> so that there might be no difference between the <hi>two</hi> Churches, but <hi>both</hi> might be of the <hi>same Constitution,</hi> so far as the necessary di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of the <hi>two States</hi> would allow? The point in Agitation was a <hi>Confederacy</hi> in opposition to <hi>Popery,</hi> and for the security of the Reformed Religion in <hi>both</hi> Kingdoms. It was obvious, therefore, to <hi>foresee,</hi> that it would be the stronger, and, every way, the better suited to that great End, if <hi>both
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:101025:136"/>
Churches</hi> stood on <hi>one</hi> bottom: For who sees not that <hi>Different Constitutions</hi> are apt to be attended with <hi>Different Customs,</hi> which in process of time may introduce <hi>Different Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents</hi> and Inclinations? Who sees not that the smallest <hi>Differences</hi> are apt to <hi>create jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies, divisions, cross-interests?</hi> And that there's nothing more necessary than <hi>Vnifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> for preserving <hi>Vnity</hi>? Besides,</p>
               <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was, peculiarly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to crave this. There's nothing more necessary to <hi>support</hi> a <hi>State,</hi> especially a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,</hi> than <hi>Vnity</hi> of <hi>Religion.</hi> It was for the <hi>Support</hi> of her <hi>State,</hi> the Security of her Monarchy, that she was to enter into this <hi>Confederacy.</hi> She was affraid of the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi>'s pretensions to the Crown of <hi>England</hi>; For this cause she was <hi>confederating</hi> with the Queen of <hi>Scotland</hi>'s Subjects, that she might have them of <hi>her side.</hi> It was her concern, therefore, to have them as much secured to her interests as possibly she could: they were, then, at a great <hi>Bay</hi> without <hi>her</hi> succour; and had referred it to <hi>her</hi> and <hi>her Council,</hi> to <hi>foresee</hi> and <hi>devise</hi> the <hi>terms</hi> on which she would grant it. And now laying all these things together, what was more natural. I say than that she should demand, that they should be of the <hi>same Religion,</hi> and their <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>same Constitution,</hi> with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This politick was so very obvious, that 'tis not to be imagined, <hi>she</hi> and her <hi>wise Council</hi> could overlook it; And tho it had
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:101025:136"/>
been no where upon Record, that she craved it, yet the common sense of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind would stand for its <hi>Credibility</hi>; what shall we say then, if we find it recorded by ane Historian, whose <hi>Honesty</hi> is not to be questioned in this matter? And such ane <hi>one</hi> we have, even <hi>Buchanan</hi> himself, tho he misplaces it, and narrates it, a long time after it was done, and as it were only by the <hi>by.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The occasion on which he records this, is, when in the year 1569. (the tenth year after this Confederacy between the <hi>Scots</hi> and the <hi>English</hi> was <hi>concerted,</hi> as I take it) the Earl of <hi>Murray,</hi> then <hi>Regent,</hi> had gone to the <hi>Northern</hi> parts of the Kingdom to settle matters there, Accounts were brought to him of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Norfolk</hi>'s Conspiracy, which was so well compacted, and so deep laid, that it was judged morally impossible to disappoint it; and <hi>Murray</hi>'s friends were earnest with him to retreat in time, and <hi>disengage</hi> himself of the opposite party, with whom he had hitherto <hi>sided</hi>; and so when <hi>Buchanan</hi> comes to give the History of this <hi>juncture,</hi> he, to find a just <hi>rise</hi> for his Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, returns no less than ten years back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, discoursing thus, <hi>The State of</hi> English <hi>affairs oblige me to look back a little; because, in these times, the interests of both Kingdoms were so twisted, that the concerns of the</hi> one <hi>cannot be represented without the</hi> other: <hi>The</hi> Scots, <hi>some years before, being delivered from the</hi> Gallican Slavery <hi>by the</hi> English <hi>assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,

               <p>Here, you see, the thing is plainly and undeniably asserted: Yet, so careless, (to say no worse) have all our Historians been, that not one of them mentions it, but he, and he does no more than mention it; and, to this minute, we are, generally, in the dark, when, how, by whom, and with what Solemnities it was done. <hi>Buchanan</hi>'s words would seem to import that it was done after, <hi>that</hi> our <hi>Deliverance</hi> (as he calls it) was accomplisht. But not one word of it in the <hi>Treaty</hi> concluded at <hi>Leith,</hi> and proclaim'd <hi>Iuly</hi> 8th, 1560. which succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed immediately upon the back of that <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance</hi>; not one word of it (I say) in that Treaty, as it is ether in <hi>Buchanan, Knox</hi> or <hi>Spotswood,</hi> or any other Historian, I have had occasion to see; neither have we any other <hi>publick Transaction</hi> or <hi>Deed</hi> that <hi>mentions</hi> it.</p>

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:101025:137"/>
sent to <hi>England,</hi> after that <hi>our Deliverance,</hi> to return thanks to Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> for her assistance: 'Tis possible it might have been done then; for, as <hi>Spotswood</hi> has it,
<q>After the Professors heard of the cold Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment that Sir <hi>Iames Sandilands,</hi> who went to <hi>France</hi> to give ane account of the <hi>Treaty,</hi> had got at <hi>that Court,</hi> their minds were greatly troubled; for, they were seasible of their own weakness, and doubtful of Support from <hi>England,</hi> if <hi>France</hi> should again invade, because of the Loss the <hi>English</hi> had received in the late Expedition; Neither, (says he) had the Earls of <hi>Morton</hi> and <hi>Glencarne,</hi> who upon breaking up of the Parliament, were sent into <hi>England,</hi> to render thanks to the <hi>Queen,</hi> and to entreat the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of her Favour, given any adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement of <hi>their</hi> acceptance.</q>
If, upon this occasion, Commission was sent to these two Earls, to <hi>subscribe,</hi> in name of the rest of the Protestants, to such ane <hi>Vnion</hi> in <hi>Religion,</hi> it exactly answers <hi>Buchanan</hi>'s Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; but no such thing is so much as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuated to have been done on that occasion. For my part, I humbly offer it to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, whither it is not possible, that <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanan</hi> intended not to lay any such stress upon the word [LIBERATI] as thereby to import, that it was <hi>after</hi> the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of our <hi>Deliverance,</hi> that the <hi>Scots subscribed:</hi> But, bringing in the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>occasionally,</hi> where he mentions it, and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:101025:138"/>
intending to dispatch it in as few words as he could; he did not stand <hi>nicely</hi> upon the wording of it. And if tis holds, the most Rational and Natural Account will be, that <hi>Secretary Maitland,</hi> and <hi>Sir Robert Melvil,</hi> who were sent by the <hi>Scottish Lords,</hi> in the beginning of <hi>November</hi> 1559. to implore the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>England</hi>'s Assistance, were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to agree, in name of the <hi>whole body,</hi> to this <hi>Union</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> if it should be demanded. That the <hi>Secretary</hi> had <hi>power</hi> to <hi>treat,</hi> and <hi>agree to,</hi> and <hi>sign</hi> Articles, is certain; for, amongst the Instructions given to the Commissioners for concluding the <hi>Treaty</hi> at <hi>Berwick,</hi> dated at <hi>Glasgow, Feb.</hi> 10. 1559/66.

               <p>This, I say, is one of the Articles of these instructions; from which it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that <hi>Lethington,</hi> had <hi>signed</hi> Articles in <hi>England</hi>; tho we are no where told what they were. And may it not pass for a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable conjecture, that <hi>that</hi> concerning <hi>Vnity</hi> in <hi>Religious Worship</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> was one of them?

               <p n="3">3. In the <hi>Old Scottish Liturgy</hi> compiled in these times, and afterwards used publickly in all the Churches, There is <hi>a Thanksgiving unto God, after our Deliverance from the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of the</hi> Frenchmen, <hi>with Prayers made for the Continuance of the Peace betwixt the Realms of</hi> Scotland <hi>and</hi> England, wherein we have these Petitions offered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Grant unto us,</hi> O Lord, <hi>that with such Reverence we may remember thy Benefits received, that, after this, in our Default, we never enter into</hi> Hostility <hi>against the Realm and Nation of</hi> England. <hi>Suffer us never,</hi> O Lord, <hi>to fall to that Ingratitude and detestable Vnthankfulness, that we should seek the Destruction and Death of those whom thou hast made instruments to Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us from the Tyranny of Merciless Strangers: Dissipate thou the Counsels of such as Deceitfully travel to stir the hearts of the inhabitants of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:101025:139"/>
Realm against the other: Let their malicious practices be their own confusion; and grant thou of thy Mercy, that Love, Concord and Tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity may continue and increase amongst the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of this</hi> Isle, <hi>even to the coming of our Lord</hi> Jesus Christ, <hi>by whose glorious Gospel, thou, of thy Mercy dost</hi> CALL US BOTH TO UNITY, PEACE AND CHRISTIAN CONCORD, <hi>the full</hi> PERFECTION <hi>whereof we shall possess in the fullness of thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Here is a <hi>set</hi> of <hi>Demonstrations</hi> to the same purpose also: And now, let any man lay all these things together; The <hi>Letter</hi> to <hi>Cecil</hi>; The <hi>Confederacy</hi> betwixt <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England; Buchanan</hi>'s Testimony; and these <hi>Thanksgivings</hi> and <hi>Prayers,</hi> and then let him judge impartially whither or not, there is reason to believe, that, in those days, there was a good Agreement between the <hi>Scottish</hi> and <hi>English Protestants,</hi> as to <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Church Matters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, I think, I have sufficiently cleared that our Reformers, <hi>Generally,</hi> if not <hi>Vnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously,</hi> lookt upon the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> as so <hi>well</hi> constituted, that they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged <hi>her Communion</hi> to be a <hi>Lawful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</hi> But before I proceed to other things I must try, if I can make any more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of what has been said: And I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son thus,</p>
               <p>Was there not here <hi>truely</hi> and <hi>really,</hi> a Confederacy, ane Oath, <hi>A Solemn League and Covenant,</hi> betwixt the <hi>Scottish</hi> and the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:101025:140"/>
                  <hi>English</hi> Protestants? Were not these <hi>English</hi> Protestants, then, <hi>united</hi> in <hi>that Society,</hi> which, at that time, was, and, ever since, hath been called <hi>The Church of England</hi>? And was not the <hi>Church of England</hi> of that same very constitution, <hi>then,</hi> that it was of in King <hi>Charles the First</hi> his time, for example, <hi>Anno</hi> 1642? But if so, then, I ask again, was not this <hi>Solemn League and Covenant,</hi> made, thus, by our Reformers with <hi>their Brethren</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> as much designed for the Security, the Defence, the Maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, of <hi>the Church of England,</hi> as then by Law established, as for the Establishment of our Reformation? Did not our <hi>Reformers promise Mutual Faith</hi> to the <hi>English,</hi> as well as the <hi>English promised to them</hi>? Would it have been consistent with the mutual bonds and obligations of this Confederacy, this <hi>Solemn League and Covenant,</hi> for the <hi>Scottish Reformers,</hi> to have raised ane Army, at that time, against Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to <hi>invade</hi> her Dominions, in order to <hi>ruine</hi> the <hi>Church of England</hi>? I cannot imagine, any sober person can grudge to grant me this much also. But if this be granted, then I ask in the third place, Did not that <hi>Solemn League and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> made by <hi>our Reformers,</hi> with <hi>those</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> run in a direct op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to the <hi>Solemn League and Covenant,</hi> made by our <hi>Scottish Presbyterians</hi> with a <hi>Factious Party</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> for <hi>destroying</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> in King <hi>Charles</hi> the First's time? Nay did not our <hi>Scottish Presbyterians</hi>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:101025:140"/>
in that King's time, by entering into that <hi>Solemn League and Covenant,</hi> directly, and effrontedly, <hi>break</hi> through <hi>the Charge and Commandment,</hi> which <hi>our Reformers left</hi> to <hi>their Posterity,</hi> That the <hi>Amity</hi> betwixt the <hi>Nations, in God contracted and begun, might by them, be kept inviolate for ever</hi>? Nay, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet, did not our <hi>Reformers</hi> solemnly <hi>pray</hi> against those who made the <hi>Solemn League and Covenant</hi> in the days of King <hi>Charles</hi> the First? Did they not address to God, that he would <hi>dissipate their Counsels,</hi> and <hi>let their Malicious Practices be their own Confusion</hi>? And now, let the world judge what rational pretences these <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> in that <hi>Holy Martyrs</hi> time, and, by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, our <hi>present Presbyterians,</hi> can make for their being the <hi>only true</hi> and <hi>genuine Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors</hi> of <hi>our First Reformers</hi>? Expecting solid and serious Answers to these Questions,</p>
               <p>I shall now advance in the prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my main undertaking on this Head, which was to shew, how our Reformers agreed with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> in several momentous matters Relative to the Constitution and Communion, the Government and Polity of the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But because I have insisted so long on this general one, which I have just now taken leave of, I shall only instance in two or three more, and dispatch them as speedily as I can.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Then, it is evident, and undeniable, that our <hi>Scottish</hi> Protestants, for some years,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:101025:141"/>
used the <hi>Liturgy</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in their <hi>publick Devotions.</hi> Indeed,</p>
               <p>The very first publick step, towards our Reformation, made by the <hi>Lords of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,</hi> was to appoint this <hi>Liturgy</hi> to be used: It was ordered upon the third day of <hi>December,</hi> 1557. as both <hi>Knox</hi> and <hi>Calder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> have it. <note n="(a)" place="margin">Kn. 112. Cald. 5.</note> Take the Ordinance in <hi>Knox</hi> his words: <hi>The Lords and Barons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing Christ Iesus conveened frequently in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, in the which, these Heads were concluded.</hi> First, <hi>It is thought expedient, advised and ordained, That in all Parishes of this Realm, the</hi> Common Prayer <hi>be</hi> read, <hi>weekly, on Sunday, and other Festival days, publickly, in the Parish Churches, with the</hi> Lessons <hi>of the Old and New Testament, conformable to the Book of Common Prayers: And if the Curates of the Parishes be qualified, that they read the same; And if they be not, or if they refuse, that the most qualified in the Parish use and read the same,</hi> &amp;c. <note n="(b)" place="margin">Kn. Ib. Spot. 117. Pet. 192.</note> 
                  <hi>Spotswood</hi> and <hi>Petrie</hi> give the same account. But such is the <hi>Genius</hi> of Mr. <hi>Calderwood,</hi> that you are to expect few things, which may make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Interest, <hi>candidly</hi> and <hi>sincerely</hi> represented by him. For instance, in his overly account of this matter, he quite omits the mention of <hi>other Holy days,</hi> besides <hi>Sundays.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These consistent Testimonies of all those four Historians, are so full and plain a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of the Matter of Fact, that I cannot foresee so much as one Objection that can be made, or one Evasion that can
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:101025:141"/>
be thought on, unless it be, That it is not said by any of them, that it was the <hi>Book</hi> of the <hi>Common Prayers</hi> of the <hi>Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi> But this difficulty is soon removed. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. It was either the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>the Common Prayers</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> or the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevian Liturgy:</hi> For we no where read of a <hi>Third,</hi> ever pretended to have been used, in those times, in <hi>Scotland:</hi> Now that it was not the <hi>Liturgy</hi> of <hi>Geneva,</hi> is plain; for besides that it is utterly incredible, that there could have been so <hi>many</hi> Copies, of the <hi>Genevian Form</hi> in the <hi>vulgar Language,</hi> then, in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as might serve so <hi>many Parish</hi> Churches; Nay, that 'tis highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, there was not so much as <hi>one.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this, I say, in the <hi>Genevian Form,</hi> which was afterwards used in <hi>Scotland,</hi> there is no <hi>Order</hi> for, no <hi>footstep</hi> of, the observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>other Holy-days,</hi> besides <hi>Sunday</hi>: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any <hi>Order</hi> in it for <hi>Reading of Lessons of the Old and New Testament,</hi> except in the <hi>Treatise</hi> of <hi>Fasting,</hi> which was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled till the year 1565. There, indeed, <hi>Lessons</hi> are appointed, such and such <hi>Psalms,</hi> and such and such <hi>Histories,</hi> in the <hi>Old,</hi> but not so much as <hi>one Tittle</hi> of the <hi>New</hi> Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: In all the rest of the <hi>Book</hi> a <hi>deep Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> about <hi>Lessons</hi>; than which there cannot be a clearer Demonstration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the <hi>Book</hi> appointed to be used in <hi>December</hi> 1557, was not that of <hi>Geneva.</hi> Indeed</p>
               <p n="2">2. None of our <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Historians, neither <hi>Petrie,</hi> nor <hi>Calderwood,</hi> have the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:101025:142"/>
confidence to pretend, nay to insinuate the possibility of its being the <hi>Common Order</hi> of <hi>Geneva</hi>; which, 'tis very probable, they would have done, if they had had the smallest hopes of making it feasible. On the contrary, <hi>Calderwood</hi> seems fairly to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that it was the <hi>English Liturgy</hi>; but then this acknowledgement lies at such a distance from the year 1557. that, no doubt, he thought himself pretty secure, that few Readers would reflect upon it as ane acknowledgment; he doth not make it till he comes to the year 1623, when he had occasion to tell how the use of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Liturgy</hi> was brought into the <hi>New Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of <hi>St. Andrews.</hi> Take it in his own words <note n="(c)" place="margin">Cald. 800.</note> 
                  <hi>Upon the</hi> 15<hi>th of</hi> January, <hi>Master</hi> Robert Howie, <hi>Principal of the New College of</hi> St. Andrews, <hi>Doctor</hi> Wedderburn, <hi>and Doctor</hi> Melvin, <hi>were directed by a Letter from Doctor</hi> Young, <hi>in the Kings Name, to use the</hi> English <hi>Liturgy, Morning and Evening, in the New College, where all the Students were present at Morning and Evening Prayers: Which was presently put in execution; notwithstanding they wanted the warrant of any General Assembly, or of any CONTINVED PRAC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TICE OF THE FORM in time, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past, since the Reformation.</hi> Where, you see, he lays the stress of his Argument against it, on its nor having had <hi>a continued Practice,</hi> since the Reformation, which is a clear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession that at the Reformation, it was in <hi>practice,</hi> tho that <hi>practice</hi> was not <hi>continued.</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:101025:142"/>
But whither he acknowledged this or not, is no great matter; we have sufficient Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for the point in hand, without it: For</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Buchanan</hi>'s Testimony, which was adduced before about the <hi>Scots subscriving to the Worship and Rites of the Church of</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, is unexceptionable: And yet it is not all. For</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Order, as you see it appointed by the <hi>Lords</hi> of the <hi>Congregation,</hi> Decem. 3d, 1557. is, That the <hi>Book,</hi> there authorised, be used in all Churches from that very date: but we find by the <hi>First Book of Discipline,</hi> 
                  <note n="(d)" place="margin">Spot. 153.</note> That the <hi>Order of Geneva</hi> was only coming in to be used, <hi>then,</hi> in <hi>some</hi> of the Churches, <hi>i. e.</hi> 1560. And it had nothing like a public Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment, till the General Assembly holden at <hi>Edenburgh, Dec.</hi> 25, 1652. For <hi>then,</hi> and not till <hi>then, It was concluded, that ane Vniform Order should be kept in the Ministration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, Solemnization of Marriages, and Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of the Dead, according to the Kirk of</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva. So it is in the <hi>Mss.</hi> and so <hi>Petrie</hi> hath it; <note n="(e)" place="margin">Pet. 233.</note> But <hi>Nature</hi> works again with <hi>Calderwood</hi>; For he has no more but this, <hi>It was ordained that ane Vniform Order be kept in the Ministration of the Sacraments, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Book of</hi> Geneva: <note n="(f)" place="margin">Cald. 32.</note> Omitting <hi>Marriage,</hi> and the <hi>Burial of the Dead; Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,</hi> I believe, to bear the <hi>other</hi> Company; for the <hi>Burial of the Dead,</hi> was the <hi>Dead Flee</hi>: Why?

It seems this Act of the General As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, <hi>Decem.</hi> 1562. has not been strong enough for turning out the <hi>English Liturgy,</hi> and introducing the <hi>form</hi> of <hi>Geneva</hi>: For if we may believe <hi>Calderwood</hi> himself, <note n="(h)" place="margin">Ib. 39.</note> The <hi>General Assembly</hi> holden at <hi>Edenburgh, Decem.</hi> 25. 1564. found themselves concerned to make another Act, ordaining <hi>Every Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, Exhorter, and Reader to have one of the</hi> Psalm books, <hi>lately printed at</hi> Edenburgh, <hi>and use the Order contained therein, in Prayers, Marriage, and Administration of the Sacraments.</hi> Where observe further, that <hi>Prayers,</hi> not mentioned in the Act, 1562. are now put in; from which it may be probably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured, that, as much as <hi>Knox</hi> was against the <hi>English Liturgy,</hi> he found many difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to get it laid aside; so many that, it has not only been used by some (few or many, I cannot tell) in the Ministration of the Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> after the Act 1562. But the Clergy have not found themselves obliged to forbear the use of it, in the <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick prayers</hi>; so that it was needful, in this Assembly 1564, to make a <hi>New Act,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stricting

them both as to <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>other Ministrations,</hi> to the <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Geneva.</hi> And if this holds, we have the <hi>English Liturgy,</hi> at least, <hi>seven Years</hi> in continued practice in <hi>Scotland.</hi> But it is enough for my main pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that it was once universally in use, which I think cannot be denied by any who impartially considers what hath been said: And now</p>
               <p n="6">6. May not I adduce one Testimony more? 'Tis true it is of a latter date: But it is very plain and positive, and what I have adduced already is security enough for its Credibility: It is the Testimony of the Compilers of our <hi>Scottish Liturgy,</hi> which made the great <hi>Stir</hi> in the year 1637. And was made one of the main pretences for the first Eruptions of that execrable Rebellion which ensued; The <hi>Compilers</hi> of that <hi>Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi> I say, in their <hi>Preface</hi> to it, tell us, <hi>That it was then, known, that diverse years after the Reformation we had no other Order for Common Prayer, but the</hi> English <hi>Liturgy.</hi> A</p>
               <p>Third Principle wherein our Reformers agreed with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and which stands in direct contradiction to the Principles of our Presbyterians, is, that they own'd, <hi>the Church had a great Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the State; That it belong'd to the Civil Magistrate to reform the Church; That People might appeal from the Church, to the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I am not now to enter into the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie concerning the <hi>Dependence</hi> or <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:101025:144"/>
of the <hi>Church</hi> upon the <hi>State,</hi> that falls not within the compass of my present Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking: Neither will I say that our Presbyterians are in the <hi>wrong,</hi> as to the <hi>true substantial</hi> Matter agitated in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie. All I am concerned for at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, is that, in these times, <hi>those</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> own'd a great <hi>Dependence</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> upon the <hi>State,</hi> and that our Reformers agreed with them in <hi>that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi>; and I think I may make short work of it: For</p>
               <p>That that was the <hi>Principle</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in these times, I think no man can readily deny, who knows any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her, at, and a good many years after, her Reformation. All my business is to shew, that our Reformers were of that <hi>same Principle.</hi> And I think that shall be easily made to appear: For</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Civil Magistrates power</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Church what can be more clear, than the <hi>Petition</hi> presented to the Queen Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, in <hi>November</hi> 1558? There our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers tell her Majesty, <note n="(i)" place="margin">Kn. 130. Spot. 118.</note> that <hi>Knowing no Order placed in this Realm, but her Majesty and her grave Council, set, to amend, as well, the Disorder Ecclesiastical, as the Defaults in the Temporal Regiment, they do most humbly prostrate themselves, before her Feet, asking Iustice, and her Gracious Help against such as falsely traduced and accused them as Hereticks and Schismaticks,</hi> &amp;c. In which Address, we have these two things very clear and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:101025:144"/>
evident, 1. That they own'd, that the <hi>Civil</hi> Magistrate, had <hi>power</hi> to amend <hi>Ecclesiastical Disorders,</hi> as well as <hi>Temporal.</hi> 2. That, in consequence of this, they applied to the <hi>Civil</hi> Magistrate for <hi>protection</hi> against the <hi>pursuits</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> And in their <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station</hi> given in to the Parliament about that same time,
<q>They most humbly beseech the sacred Authority to think of them as faithful and obedient Subjects, and take them into its Protection, keeping that Indifferency, which becometh Gods Lieutenants to use, towards those, who, in his Name, do call for Defence against Cruel Oppressors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
Meaning the then Church-men. <note n="(k)" place="margin">Knox: 136. Spot. 120.</note> Indeed,</p>
               <p>None clearer for this than <hi>Knox</hi> himself, as is to be seen fully in his <hi>Appellation from the cruel and most unjust Sentence, pronounced against him by the False Bishops and Clergy of</hi> Scotland, <hi>(as he himself names it)</hi> For there <note n="(l)" place="margin">Kn. Ap. 4.</note> He lays down and endeavours to prove this Assertion, <hi>That it is lawful to Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and to Preachers of Christ Iesus to appeal from the Sentence and Iudgment of the visible Church, to the Knowledge of the temporal Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, who, by Gods Law, is bound to hear their Causes and to defend them from Tyranny.</hi> And in that same Appellation, <note n="(m)" place="margin">p. 13, 14, 15, 16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> he largerly asserts and maintains the <hi>Dependance</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> upon the <hi>State: The Ordering and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of Religion, with the instruction of Subjects</hi> (he says) <hi>doth appertain especially to the Civil Magistrate.</hi> For why?
<q>
                     <hi>Moses</hi> had great power in the Matters of Religion:
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:101025:145"/>
God revealed nothing particularly to <hi>Aaron</hi> (the Church-man) but commanded him to depend from the Mouth of <hi>Moses</hi> (the Civil Magistrate): <hi>Moses</hi> was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to separate <hi>Aaron</hi> and his <hi>Sons</hi> for the Priesthood: <hi>Aaron</hi> and his <hi>Sons</hi> were subject to <hi>Moses. Moses</hi> was so far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to <hi>Aaron,</hi> that the <hi>one</hi> commanded, the <hi>other</hi> obeyed. The <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> were commanded to read the Book of the Law all the days of their Lives, not only for their own private Edification, but for the publick preservation of Religion; so <hi>David, Solomon, Asa, Iehosophat, Hezekiah, Iosiah</hi> understood it, and interested them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the Matters of the Church, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</q>
From which it is evident, (saith he) <hi>That the Reformation of Religion, in all points, together with the Punishment of false Teachers, doth appertain to the power of the Civil Magistrate: For what God required of them, his justice must require of others, having the like Charge and Authority; what he did approve in them, he cannot but approve in all others, who with like Zeal and Sincerity do enterprize to purge the Lords Temple and Sanctuary.</hi> Thus <hi>Knox</hi> (I say) in that <hi>Appellation.</hi> I do not concern my self with the truth or falshood of his positions; neither am I to justify or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn his Arguments; All I am to make of it is, to ask my Presbyterian Brethren, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther these <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Knox</hi>'s suit well with <hi>declining</hi> the <hi>Civil</hi> Magistrate as ane <hi>incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Iudge</hi> in Ecclesiastical matters? with
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:101025:145"/>
refusing to appear before him <hi>prima instantia</hi> for the <hi>tryal</hi> of <hi>Doctrines preacht</hi> in the <hi>Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit</hi>? with the famous distinction of the Kings having <hi>power</hi> about Church matters <hi>Cumulative</hi> but not <hi>Privative? &amp;c.</hi> I am affraid it shall be hard enough to reconcile them.</p>
               <p>I shall only instance in one principle more, which seems to have been common to <hi>our,</hi> and the <hi>English Reformers,</hi> but it is one of very weighty consequence and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to my main design: It is</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That Excellent <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> viz. <hi>That it be done according to the word of God, interpreted by the Monuments and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Primitive Church.</hi> That antient, solid, approven <hi>Rule:</hi> That <hi>Rule</hi> so much commended by that excellent Writer <hi>Vincentius Lirinensis:</hi>

A <hi>Rule,</hi> indeed, which, had the <hi>Reformers</hi> of the several <hi>Churches,</hi> followed <hi>unitedly</hi> and <hi>conscientiously,</hi> in those times, when the Churches in the <hi>Western</hi> parts of <hi>Europe</hi> were a Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; we had not had so many <hi>different Faiths,</hi> so many <hi>different Modes of Worship</hi>; so many <hi>different Governments,</hi> and <hi>Disciplines,</hi> as, Alas! this day, <hi>divide</hi> the <hi>Protestant Churches,</hi>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:101025:146"/>
and by consequence, <hi>weaken</hi> the <hi>Protestant Interest:</hi> A <hi>Rule,</hi> which had the pretenders to Reformed Religion, in <hi>Scotland,</hi> still stood by, we had not, possibly, had so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>horrid Rebellions,</hi> so many <hi>unchristian Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,</hi> so many <hi>unaccountable Revolutions,</hi> both in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> as, to our sad Experience, have, in the <hi>Result,</hi> so <hi>unhing'd</hi> all the Principles of <hi>natural justice and honesty,</hi> and <hi>disabled,</hi> nay, <hi>eaten out</hi> the <hi>principles</hi> of <hi>Christianity</hi> amongst us, that now we are not <hi>disposed</hi> so much for any thing as downright <hi>Atheism.</hi> But were our <hi>Reformers,</hi> indeed, for this <hi>Rule</hi>? That shall be demonstrated by and by, when we shall have occasion to bring it in again as naturally, to which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity I now refer it: in the mean time, let us briefly sum up all that hath been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto said, and try to what it amounts.</p>
               <p>I have, I think, made it appear, that, while our Reformation was a carrying on, and when it was established <hi>Anno</hi> 156<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, there was no such Controversie agitated, in the Churches, as that concerning the <hi>indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensible necessity</hi> of <hi>Presbytery,</hi> and the <hi>Vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of Prelacy,</hi> concerning the <hi>Divine Right</hi> of <hi>Parity,</hi> or the <hi>Vnallowableness</hi> of <hi>imparity</hi> amongst the Governors of the Church. I have said enough to make it credible, that our <hi>Scottish</hi> Reformers had no peculiar occasions, opportunities, provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, abilities, for falling on that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie, or determining of it, more than the Reformers of other Churches: In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:101025:146"/>
of this, I have further shewed, that, from all the monuments of these times, I have seen, not so much as <hi>One</hi> of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers can be adduced, as asserting the <hi>Presbyterian side</hi> of this Controversie. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I have, I think, made it evident, that our Reformers went very much upon the <hi>same Principles,</hi> on which the <hi>English</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers went, who still continued <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy</hi>; unquestionably, on <hi>many Principles</hi> of great weight and importance, as to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution and Communion, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Polity of the Church, which staid in direct opposition and contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the <hi>Principles</hi> of our <hi>present</hi> Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians. And now, let any judicious and impartial person lay these things together, and then let him ingenuously determine, whether it be not highly incredible, that our Reformers were for the <hi>divine institution</hi> and <hi>indispensible Right</hi> of <hi>Parity,</hi> and the <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulness</hi> of <hi>Prelacy,</hi> which is the <hi>Principle,</hi> at least, the <hi>Profession</hi> of our <hi>present</hi> Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians. Yet after all this,</p>
               <p>I must tell my Reader, that I have insist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on these things, so much as I have done, principally for smoothing the way for the Evidences I am yet to produce for the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of <hi>my side</hi> of the <hi>Second Enquiry.</hi> And I am content, that these things I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready discoursed, should pass for no more than <hi>Rational Presumptions,</hi> till I have tried if <hi>more strength</hi> can be added to them, and they can be rendered <hi>more cogent</hi> and <hi>concluding</hi>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:101025:147"/>
by a succession of plain, positive, direct, and formal proofs of my Assertion: And, to engage my Readers attention, I dare adventure to promise him that, to as high a degree as the nature of the thing is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, at least, can reasonably bear. And so, without further address, I thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
               <p>Before our Reformation was established by Law, our Reformers <hi>addressed</hi> to the Government by several <hi>Petitions,</hi> that <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> might be <hi>reformed.</hi> I shall take notice of <hi>Three,</hi> all pertinent to my purpose.

For my

part I should rather think we have not his History <hi>intire,</hi> and as he design'd it for the Press (for which, I have heard other very pregnant presumptions) than that so great a man was guilty of so great ane <hi>Oscitancy.</hi> But whatever be of this, <hi>Knox</hi> has it, and that is enough; and <hi>Calderwood</hi> has abridged it, and that's more than enough for my Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Brethren.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Third Petition</hi> which I promised to adduce, is <hi>that</hi> which was presented to the Parliament which established the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Anno</hi> 1560. for which we are obliged to <hi>Knox</hi> alone also; at least, so far as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Argument is concerned. <note n="(h)" place="margin">Kn. 261.</note> For tho both <hi>Spotswood</hi> and <hi>Petrie</hi>

That which I take notice of in it, as it is in <hi>Knox,</hi> is, That when our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers came to crave the Reformation of the <hi>Ecclesiastical State,</hi> they bespoke the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thus. <hi>And lest that your Honours should doubt in any of the premisses</hi> (they had affirmed before, That the Doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church contained many pestiferous errors; that the Sacraments of Jesus Christ were most shamefully abused and profaned by the <hi>Roman</hi> Harlot; that the true Discipline of the antient Church, amongst that Sect, was utterly extinguisht; and that the Clergy, of all men within the Realm, were most cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:101025:152"/>
in life and manners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) <hi>we offer our selves evidently to prove, that in all the</hi> Rabble <hi>of the</hi> Clergy, <hi>there is not one Lawful Minister, IF GODS WORD, THE PRACTICES OF THE APOSTLES, THE SINCERITY OF THE PRIMITIVE CHVRCH, AND THEIR OWN ANCIENT LAWS SHALL IVDGE OF THE ELECTION.</hi> Here, I say, our Reformers insist on that same very Rule, for finding if there be Corruptions in, and by consequence for reforming of, the Church, on which they insisted, in the aforementioned Petition; from which, 'tis evident, they persisted of the same senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and 'tis easy to draw the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences.</p>
               <p>Such were the sentiments of our <hi>Scottish</hi> Reformers, before the Reformed Religion had the countenance of the Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Acts of Parliament on its side, and was made the National Religion. Let us try next what kind of Government they did establish, when they had got Law for them? Whither they established a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that was to be managed by Ministers <hi>acting</hi> in <hi>Parity,</hi> or in <hi>Imparity</hi>? And, here, I think, the Controversy might very soon be brought to a very fair issue. The <hi>First Book of Discipline,</hi> the Acts of many General Assemblies, the Acts of many Parliaments, Both, without interruption; the unanimous Consent of Historians, and the uncontro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Practice of the Church for many years; all concurring to this Assertion.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:101025:153"/>
That the first Establishment was of a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which was to be managed by <hi>Superintendents,</hi> and <hi>Parochial Ministers, Elders</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> acting in <hi>Subordination,</hi> not in a <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Parity</hi> with, but in a <hi>State</hi> of <hi>inferiority</hi> in <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> to these <hi>Superintendents.</hi> This Establishment, I say, is so clear and undoubted from all these <hi>fountains,</hi> That no more needed be said upon the whole Argument. But because our Presbyterian <hi>Historians</hi> and <hi>Antiquaries,</hi>, tho they cannot <hi>deny</hi> the thing, do yet endeavor with all their <hi>Might</hi> and <hi>Cunning</hi> to <hi>intricate</hi> it, and <hi>obscure</hi> it; I shall, further, undertake two things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>I. I shall give the world a fair prospect of the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Superintendents,</hi> as they were, then, established, and of the <hi>Disparities</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>them</hi> and <hi>Parish Ministers.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>II. I shall endeavour to dissipate these <hi>Mists,</hi> whereby our Presbyterian Brethren are so very earnest to involve and darken this Matter. As for the</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">I. The world may competently see, that <hi>Superintendents</hi> as established in <hi>Scotland,</hi> at the Reformation, had a considerable <hi>stock</hi> of Prerogatives, or Preheminencies (call them as ye will) which raised them far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove other Churchmen, far above the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowances of that <hi>Parity,</hi> our Presbyterian Brethren contend for so eagerly, from the following Enumeration.</p>

                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:101025:153"/>1. They had <hi>Districts</hi> or <hi>Diocesses</hi> of far larger extent than other Churchmen: Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Ministers had only their private Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes, and might have been as many as there were Churches in the Kingdom: But ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Scheme</hi> laid down by our Reformers in the <hi>First Book of Discipline, Head</hi> 5. <note n="(a)" place="margin">Spot. 158.</note> only ten or twelve Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendents were design'd to have the <hi>Chief Care</hi> (as it is worded in the Prayer at the Admission of a Superintendent) of all the Churches within the Kingdom: Indeed ten are only, there, design'd, but it was because of the scarcity of qualified men, as we shall learn hereafter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As they had larger <hi>Districts</hi> than Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish Ministers, so, there were correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>Specialities</hi> in their Election.

                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:101025:154"/>3.

For the Question is not whither <hi>Superintendency</hi> was design'd to be <hi>perpetual</hi> or <hi>temporary</hi>? but whither it was a <hi>Prelacy?</hi> And if it was a <hi>Prelacy,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> was not, <hi>then,</hi> govern'd by Ministers <hi>acting</hi> in <hi>parity.</hi> The <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> or <hi>Temporariness</hi> of it doth not <hi>affect</hi> its <hi>nature:</hi> If it was a <hi>Prelacy</hi> at all, it was as <hi>really</hi> a <hi>Prelacy,</hi> tho it had lasted but for a <hi>Day,</hi> as it had been, tho it had lasted till the <hi>Day of Iudgment.</hi> Just as our Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Brethren were as <hi>really</hi> Addressers to K. <hi>I.</hi> by addressing <hi>once,</hi> as they should have been, tho they had continued addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to him till this very minute. This alone, in all conscience, might be enough for discussing this Plea. Yet, that I may not offend the Party, by seeming to think so <hi>meanly</hi> of this <hi>mighty</hi> argument; I shall insist a little longer, and consider</p>
               <p n="2">2. If they have any sufficient <hi>Fund,</hi> in the Records of these times, for this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence? And</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:101025:168"/>3. What Force or Solidity is in the reason insisted on to make this pretence seem plausible? As to the first, <hi>viz.</hi> Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there is any sufficient <hi>Fund</hi> in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of these times for this pretence? All I have observed insisted on for this, is only one phrase in the fifth Head of the First Book of Discipline, AT THIS TIME. Take the whole period as it is in <hi>Petrie</hi>; for he censures <hi>Spotswood</hi> for curtailing it. As <hi>Petrie</hi> has it, it runs thus. <hi>If the Ministers whom God hath endued with his singular Graces, among us, should be appointed to several places, there to make their continual Residence, the greatest part of the Realm should be destitute of all Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; which should not only be the occasion of great Murmur, but also dangerous to the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many; and therefore we have thought it a thing expedient</hi> AT THIS TIME, <hi>That from the whole number of Godly and Learned Men, now, presently, in this Realm, be selected</hi> Ten <hi>or</hi> Twelve (<hi>for in so many</hi> Provinces <hi>we have divided the whole</hi>) <hi>to whom Charge and Commandment should be given to plant and erect Kirks, to set, order, and appoint Ministers to the Countries, that shall be appointed to their care, where none are now.</hi> 
                  <note n="(d)" place="margin">Ibid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> This is the whole foundation of the <hi>Plea,</hi> for the <hi>Temporariness</hi> of <hi>Superintendency</hi>; but, if I mistake not, the true <hi>Gloss</hi> of this <hi>period,</hi> will amount to no more than this,
<q>That because there were, then, so few men qualified for the Office of <hi>Superintendency,</hi> tho <hi>Ten</hi> or <hi>Twelve</hi> were, by far, too small a number for the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:101025:169"/>
whole Kingdom, yet, at that time, they thought it expedient to establish no more: And tho, when the Church should be sufficiently provided with Ministers, it would be highly reasonable, that the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendents</hi> should have places appointed them, for their continual Residence; yet, in that juncture, it was necessary that they should be constantly travelling thro their <hi>Districts,</hi> to preach and plant Churches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
That the period will bear this <hi>Gloss</hi> is obvious to any who consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it impartially. And that <hi>this,</hi> and not the <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> is the <hi>true</hi> Gloss, I hope, may competently appear, if these things be considered,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is notorious, that the Compilers of that <hi>First Book of Discipline,</hi> were generally, to their dying day, of <hi>Prelatical Principles.</hi> They were <hi>six,</hi> as <hi>Knox</hi> tells us: <note n="(e)" place="margin">Kn. 283.</note> Mr. <hi>Iohn Winrame,</hi> who died <hi>Superintendent</hi> of <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern; Iohn Spotswood,</hi> who was many years a <hi>Superintendent,</hi> and a constant Enemy to <hi>parity,</hi> as appears from his <hi>Sons</hi> account of him. <note n="(f)" place="margin">Spot. 344.</note> 
                  <hi>Iohn Willock,</hi> who died <hi>Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendent</hi> of the <hi>West. Iohn Dowglas,</hi> who died <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>St. Andrews. Iohn Row,</hi> who was <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>three</hi> that defended the <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi> of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> at the <hi>Conference</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the General Assembly 1575; and <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> of whom we have said enough already. Now, I ask, is it credible, that these men, all, so much for <hi>Prelacy,</hi> all their Lives, without any constraint on them
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:101025:169"/>
(As 'tis certain, there was none) should, while digesting a <hi>Model</hi> of <hi>Policy,</hi> have been only for a <hi>Prelacy</hi> that was to be laid aside, within, God knows, how short a time; so soon as the <hi>Parish Churches</hi> could be planted with Ministers? I know nothing can be said here, unless it be, that <hi>Knox</hi> was not so <hi>prelatical</hi> as the <hi>rest,</hi> and he would have it so, and the <hi>rest</hi> have yielded: But there's no ground for this. For</p>
               <p n="2">2. Even <hi>Knox</hi> himself, if he was the Author of the History which bears his Name, amongst our Presbyterian Brethren, assigns a quite other reason than the <hi>then Necessities</hi> of the Church, for the Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Superintendency: Superintendents and Overseers were nominated</hi> (says he) <note n="(g)" place="margin">Kn. 260.</note> 
                  <hi>that all things in the Church, might be carried with order, and well.</hi> A Reason, which, as it <hi>held</hi> since the Apostles times, will continue to <hi>hold</hi> so long as the Church continues. And is it not told again in that same Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, <note n="(h)" place="margin">Ib. 289.</note> That, at the <hi>Admission</hi> of <hi>Spots<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> to the <hi>Superintendency</hi> of <hi>Lothian, Iohn Knox</hi> in his Sermon asserted, <hi>the Necessity of Superintendents or Overseers,</hi> as well as <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi>? The <hi>Necessity,</hi> I say, and not the <hi>bare Expediency,</hi> in that <hi>juncture.</hi> Further, now that I have <hi>Knox</hi> on the Stage, I shall repeat over again, a Testimony of his, which I have once transcribed already from his <hi>Exhortation to England for the speedy em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing of Christs Gospel. Let no man be charged in preaching of Christ Iesus</hi> (says he <note n="(i)" place="margin">p. 110.</note> 
                  <hi>above
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:101025:170"/>
that which a man may do: I mean, that your Bishopricks be so divided, that of every</hi> one, <hi>(as they are now for the most part) may be made</hi> ten; <hi>and so in every City, and great Town, there may be placed a godly learned Man, with so many joyned with him, for preaching and instruction, as shall be thought sufficient for the bounds commited to their Charge.</hi> Than which testimony, it is not possible to find a better <hi>Comment</hi> upon that <hi>period</hi> of the <hi>First Book of Discipline,</hi> (penned also by <hi>Knox</hi> himself) which is the subject of our present Controversie; and it agrees exactly with <hi>my Gloss:</hi> For, from this Testimony it is clear, that he was for a great number of Bishops, and <hi>little Diocesses</hi>; and that in a Church sufficiently provided with Ministers, the <hi>Bishop</hi> should not be obliged to <hi>travel</hi> from place to place, for preaching; but might stay at the <hi>Chief City</hi> or Town of his <hi>Diocess.</hi> What I have said, might be sufficient for preferring <hi>Mine,</hi> to the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Gloss: But I have more to say. For</p>
               <p n="3">3. This sense of the <hi>period</hi> accords ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly with the whole tenour of the <hi>First Book of Discipline</hi>; in which, there's not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther syllable, the most partial Reader can say, favours the mistaken Conceipt about the <hi>Temporariness</hi> of <hi>Superintendency,</hi> but much to the contrary. Thus</p>

afterwards it must.</hi> Clearly importing, that, as <hi>Necessity</hi> forced them to establish a <hi>small</hi> number at <hi>first,</hi> so also, to take them as they could have them; but that a stricter accuracy in their tryal would be needful, when the number of qualified men should increase, which runs quite counter to the whole design of the Presbyterian Gloss.</p>

                  <hi>If so many able men cannot be found at present, as Necessity requireth, it is better that these Provinces wait till God provide, than that men unable to edify and govern the Church be suddenly placed in the Charge,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>The People are asked, <hi>If they will obey and honour him as Christs Minister, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and assist him in every thing pertaining to his Charge</hi>? And their Answer is, <hi>They will, and they promise him such Obedience, as becometh Sheep to give unto their Pastor,</hi> (not so long as <hi>the present Necessity forceth,</hi> or, <hi>the present Exigence requireth,</hi> but) <hi>so long as he remaineth
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:101025:171"/>
faithful in his Charge.</hi> In short, the Order or <hi>Form</hi> for <hi>admitting</hi> a <hi>Superintendent,</hi> and a <hi>Parish Minister,</hi> was all <hi>one</hi>; and there was nothing in it importing the <hi>one</hi> Office to be <hi>temporary,</hi> more than the <hi>other.</hi> And, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Calderwood</hi> thought fit to affirm, That <hi>Superintendents were not, then, established as of Divine Institution</hi>; yet, in all this <hi>Form</hi> the divine Institution of their Office, is as much to be found as the divine Institution of Ordinary Ministers. The People, as we had it just now, were asked, if they would obey him <hi>as Christs Minister</hi>? And he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self was asked, <hi>If he knew that the Excellency of this Office, to the which</hi> GOD CALLED HIM <hi>did require that his Conversation should be irreprehensible</hi>? And again it was asked the People, <hi>Will ye not acknowledge this your Brother for the</hi> Minister of Christ Jesus? <hi>Your Overseer and Pastor? Will ye not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and comfort him in his Ministry and Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over you, against all such as wickedly would rebel against</hi> God, <hi>and</hi> HIS HOLY OR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DINANCE? And in the <hi>Prayer</hi> after his <hi>Instalment,</hi> we have this <hi>petition, Send unto this our Brother, whom,</hi> IN THY NAME, <hi>we have charged with</hi> THE CHIEF CARE <hi>of thy Church within the bounds of</hi> Lothian, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus our Reformers thought of <hi>Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency</hi> when they composed this <hi>Form.</hi> Now, if they lookt upon it as <hi>Gods Ordinance,</hi> &amp;c. with what reason can it be said, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd it <hi>meerly</hi> to be <hi>temporary,</hi> and for <hi>the, then, Necessities of the Church.</hi> I think it will
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:101025:172"/>
be hard to prove, that it was the <hi>Divinity</hi> of these times, that men might <hi>dispense</hi> with <hi>divine Institutions</hi>; but of this more after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. In the mean time, proceed we to a further, and indeed, ane irrefragable Topick for confirming my side of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Controversie; and that is</p>
               <p n="5">5. That, as <hi>the First Book of Discipline,</hi> and the <hi>Form of admitting Superintendents,</hi> do both fairly import, that our Reformers intended nothing less than the <hi>Temporariness</hi> of <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendents,</hi> so 'tis as clear from a vast num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Acts of General Assemblies.</p>
               <p>Most of these Acts I have already ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced for shewing the <hi>Disparities</hi> between Superintendents and Ordinary Ministers, when they are seriously considered, will be found uncontrovertibly to this purpose: But there are many more; for example consider these following.</p>
               <p>The Assembly <hi>May</hi> 27, 1561. <note n="(a)" place="margin">Kn. 297. Pet. 223.

               </p>
               <p>The Assembly at <hi>Eden. Decem.</hi> 25. 1562. (as the <hi>Mss.</hi> has it) enacted, <hi>That, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the proponing and nominating of the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendents for</hi> Aberdeen, Bamf, Jedburgh, <hi>and</hi> Dumfries, <hi>appointed before in the Third Session: and the days appointed for the Election of the same; the further Advisement and Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the persons should be remitted to the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:101025:172"/>
Lords of the secret Council; providing, always, that the days appointed for their Election be not prolonged.</hi> Observe here that <hi>Aberdeen</hi> and <hi>Bamf</hi> were now design'd, <hi>each</hi> to have <hi>their</hi> Superintendent, whereas <hi>both</hi> were to be under <hi>one</hi> by the <hi>first</hi> Nomination, in the <hi>Book of Discipline</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>One of the Articles ordered by the Assembly at <hi>Eden. Decem.</hi> 25. 1564. to be presented to the Queen, was, <hi>To require that Superintendents might be placed in the Realm, where none were,</hi> viz. <hi>in the</hi> Mers, Teviotdale, Forest Twedale, <hi>and the rest of the</hi> Dales, <hi>in the</hi> South, <hi>not provided; with</hi> Aberdeen, <hi>and the other parts of the</hi> North, <hi>likewise destitute:</hi> So it is in the <hi>Mss. Petrie</hi> 
                  <note n="(b)" place="margin">Pet. 341.</note> has it only in short, <hi>That Superintendents be placed where none are.</hi> But as it is in the <hi>Mss.</hi> it shews plainly that, now that the Church was of four years standing, and the number of qualified men was increasing, the Assembly were for increasing, proportionably, the number of Superintendents: As is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated thus; by the Establishment in the <hi>First Book of Discipline,</hi> the <hi>Superintendent of Lothians Diocess</hi> comprehended the <hi>Sheriff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms</hi> of <hi>Lothian, Stirling, Mers, Lauderdale,</hi> and <hi>Twedale.</hi> 
                  <note n="(c)" place="margin">Spot. 158.</note> 
                  <hi>Spotswood</hi> was set over this <hi>Diocess</hi> in <hi>March</hi> 1560/1. He was still alive, and in the Exercise of his Office; and yet here, now, the Assembly craves that <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendents</hi> may be placed in the <hi>Mers</hi> and <hi>Twedale,</hi> and the <hi>rest</hi> of the <hi>Dales.</hi> From which it follows, that that which was but
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:101025:173"/>
                  <hi>one</hi> Diocess, <hi>Anno</hi> 1560. when qualified men were few, was design'd by the Assembly, <hi>Anno</hi> 1564. when the number of qualified men was somewhat increased, to be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, at least, into <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four.</hi> Exactly agreeable to what I have all along asserted.</p>
               <p>In the Assembly at <hi>Eden. Iuly</hi> 20. <hi>Anno</hi> 1567. That famous Assembly, whereof <hi>Buchanan</hi> was <hi>Moderator,</hi> and which tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Queen <hi>Mary</hi> from her Throne, it was agreed, by the Nobility and Barons on the one hand, and the Church on the other, <hi>That all the Popish Clergy should be dispossessed, and that Superintendents, Ministers and other</hi> NEEDFUL MEMBERS <hi>of the Kirk, should be planted in their places.</hi> So it is in the <hi>Mss.</hi> and so <hi>Spotswood</hi> hath it: <note n="(d)" place="margin">Ib. 210.</note> But both <hi>Calderwood</hi> and <hi>Petrie,</hi> tho they mention the thing, yet, labour to obscure it; for they do not so much as name <hi>Superintendents,</hi> far less, take notice that, they are reckoned amongst the <hi>Necessary Members,</hi> or were to <hi>succeed</hi> the <hi>Popish</hi> Bishops. <note n="(e)" place="margin">Pet. 356.

               <p>Farther, by the Ass. at <hi>Eden. Iuly</hi> 1. 1568. it is resolved, <hi>To advise with my Lord Regent his Grace and Council, that in the Rowms and Countreys where no Superintendents are, they may be placed.</hi> So the <hi>Mss.</hi> and <hi>Pet.</hi>

               <p>Doth not <hi>Calderwood</hi> himself tell us, that, the Ass. holden at <hi>Eden. March</hi> 1. 1570. when it appointed the Order to be observed thereafter, in handling affairs brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore General Assemblies, ordained, in the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:101025:173"/>
                  <hi>sixth place,</hi> That <hi>the Complaints of Countreys for want of Superintendents should be heard and provided for,</hi> &amp;c. <note n="(g)" place="margin">Cal. 46.</note> Further, doth not the same <hi>Calderwood</hi> record, that, when in the year 1574. the Superintendents of <hi>Angus, Lothian,</hi> and <hi>Strathern,</hi> would have dimitted their Office, the Assembly would not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of their Dimission, but ordered them to continue in their Function? <note n="(h)" place="margin">Ib. 65.</note> For what reason they offered to demit, perhaps, we shall learn hereafter. All I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for at present is, that the Assembly would needs continue them in their Office now, <hi>fourteen</hi> years after the first legal Establishment of the Reformation. The truth is, this Assembly was holden in <hi>March,</hi> and Master <hi>Andrew Melvil,</hi> the <hi>Protoplast</hi> Presbyterian in <hi>Scotland,</hi> came not to the Kingdom, till <hi>Iuly</hi> thereafter.</p>
               <p>By this time, I think, I have made it appear, that our Reformers intended no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing less than to make <hi>Superintendency</hi> only <hi>temporary,</hi> and subservient to the <hi>then</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Necessities</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise I have sufficiently made it appear, that it was merely for scarcity of qualified men, that so few <hi>Superintendents</hi> were at first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd, by the <hi>First Book of Discipline</hi>; which was the one half of my Gloss upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted period in that Book.</p>
               <p>The other half, which was, that when once the Church was competently provided with <hi>Parish Ministers,</hi> the <hi>Superintendents</hi> were no longer obliged to their <hi>Evangelistical</hi>

way of travelling constantly through their <hi>Diocesses,</hi> to preach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is plain from what both <hi>Petrie</hi> and <hi>Spotswood</hi> agree in, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the <hi>Book,</hi> viz. That they were to follow that method no longer than their Kirks were provided of Ministers, or, at least, of Readers. <note n="(i)" place="margin">Pet. 219.

                     </gap>9.</note> Thus I have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched the first thing which was proposed to be enquired into, <hi>viz.</hi> Whither there was any sufficient <hi>fund</hi> in the Records of these times, for believing that our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers intended, that <hi>Superintendency</hi> should only be <hi>temporary.</hi> It remains now that we should consider the</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>viz.</hi> What Force or Solidity is in the reason insisted on by our Presbyterian Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, to make this pretence seem plausible?</p>
               <p>The reason insisted on, by them, is, <hi>The Force of Necessity, there being so few men, then, qualified for the Ministery; scarcely one in a Province,</hi> &amp;c. Now who sees not that this so often repeated reason is intirely naught and inconsequential? For, what tho, in these times, there were few quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied men for the Ministery? How follows it, that therefore it was necessary to raise up <hi>Superintendents,</hi> and set them above their Brethren? If the principles of <hi>parity</hi> had, then, been the <hi>modish</hi> principles, could not these <hi>few,</hi> who were qualified, have govern'd the Church, suitably to these prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples? Suppose we <hi>Twenty, Thirty, Forty</hi> men, in the Kingdom, qualified for the Office of the Ministery; could not these
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:101025:174"/>
20, or 30, or 40, have divided the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom into a proportionable number of <hi>large</hi> Parishes? And, still, as more men turn'd qualified, could they not have lessened these greater Parishes, till they had multiplied them to as great a number as they pleased, or was convenient? It was <hi>easy</hi> to have done so: so very <hi>obvious,</hi> as well as <hi>easy,</hi> that, it is not to be doubted, they would have done so, if they had been of these principles. Why might not they have done so, as well as our Presbyterian Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, now adays, <hi>unite</hi> Presbyteries where they have a scarcity of Ministers of their Perswasion? Where lies the impossibility of <hi>Vniting Parishes,</hi> more than <hi>uniting Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries</hi>? Indeed</p>
               <p>This way of reasoning is more dangerous than it seems our Presbyterian Brethren are aware of, for it quite cuts the sinews of <hi>Parity,</hi> and demonstrates irrefragably, that it cannot be the <hi>Model,</hi> our blessed Lord <hi>instituted</hi> for the Government of his Church. For who can believe he would institute a <hi>Model</hi> of Government for his Church, which could not answer the ends of its institution? And is it not plain, that <hi>Parity</hi> cannot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the ends for which Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was instituted, if the Church can be reduced to that State, that the Governors thereof, <hi>forced by Necessity,</hi> must lay it aside, and, <hi>for a time,</hi> establish a <hi>Prelacy?</hi> Besides,</p>
               <p>What <hi>strange Divinity</hi> is it to maintain, that <hi>Parity</hi> is of <hi>divine Institution,</hi> and yet,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:101025:175"/>
may be laid aside in <hi>Cases</hi> of <hi>Necessity?</hi> 'Tis true <hi>G. R.</hi> in his <hi>True Representation of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Government,</hi> cited before, is bold to publish to the world, <hi>such</hi> Divinity: But let him talk what he will of <hi>the Case of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, the Force of Necessity, the Law of Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,</hi> let him put it in as many Languages as he pleases, as well as he hath done in <hi>Latin,</hi> telling, that <hi>Necessitas quicquid coegit, defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit</hi>: (tho, I must confess, I have seen few Authors more unhappy at <hi>Latin</hi>;) And all that shall never perswade me, ought never perswade any Christian, that <hi>any Necessity</hi> can oblige Christians to <hi>forsake,</hi> far less, to <hi>cross</hi> Christs institutions; for if it can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige to do so in <hi>one</hi> Case, why not in <hi>all</hi> Cases? Indeed to talk of <hi>crossing</hi> Christs institutions, when <hi>forced</hi> to it by the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Necessity,</hi> what is it else, than to open a Door to <hi>Gnosticism,</hi> to <hi>Infidelity,</hi> to <hi>Apostacy,</hi> to all imaginable kinds of <hi>Antichristian Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidy</hi> and <hi>Villany</hi>? But enough of this at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</p>
               <p>That which I am concerned for, is only this, that, being it was so very obvious and easy for our Reformers to have cast the very first <hi>Scheme</hi> of the Government of the Church, according to the <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies</hi> of <hi>Parity,</hi> if they had believed the <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>indispensable institution</hi> of it; and being that they did it not, we have all the reason in the world to believe, that they believed no such principle. For my part, I am so far from thinking it reasonable, that
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:101025:175"/>
                  <hi>Prelacy</hi> should be only needful, where there is a scarcity of men qualified to be Ministers; that on the contrary I do profess, I am of opinion, that <hi>Prelacy</hi> seems to be every whit as needful and expedient, if not more, (supposing we had it in our power to <hi>cut</hi> and <hi>carve</hi> (as we say) on Christs institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) where there are <hi>many,</hi> as where there are <hi>few</hi> Ministers. Sure I am, Experience hath taught so, and teaches so daily: and as sure I am, it can, with great reason, be accounted for, why it should be so; but if it is so, I think, it is only <hi>help at a dead Lift</hi> (as we say) to say, that <hi>Superintendency</hi> was established at our Reformation, only, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the <hi>Scarcity</hi> of <hi>men qualified</hi> to be Ministers. And so I proceed to our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns next Plea, which is,</p>
               <p>SECONDLY, <hi>That Superintendency was not the same with Episcopacy. Calderwood</hi> assigns seven or eight differences between <hi>Superintendents</hi> and <hi>Bishops</hi>; <note n="(a)" place="margin">Cald. 26, 27.</note> and his faithful Disciple <hi>G. R.</hi> in his <hi>First Vindication,</hi> in <hi>answer</hi> to the <hi>first Question,</hi> resumes the same Plea, and insists mostly on the same Differences. <hi>Calderwood</hi> reckons thus,
<list>
                     <item>1. <hi>In the Election, Examination and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Ministers, the Superintendents were bound to the Order prescribed in the</hi> 4<hi>th Head of the First Book of Discipline; which is far diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the Order observed by Prelates.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. <hi>Superintendents kept not the bounds, nor the limits of the old Diocesses.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>
                        <pb n="158" facs="tcp:101025:176"/>3. <hi>Superintendents might not remain above twenty days in any place, till they had passed through the whole bounds; must preach, at least, thrice in the week; must stay no longer in the Chief Town of their Charge, than three or four Months at most, but must re-enter in Visitation of the rest of the Kirks in their bounds. Bishops think preaching the least of their Charge.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>4. <hi>The Election, Examination, and Admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Superintendent, is set down far diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the Election, Examination and Admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Bishops now adays,</hi> &amp;c.</item>
                     <item>5. <hi>Superintendents were admitted without other Ceremonies than sharp Examination,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>To the Inauguration of a Bishop is required the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans Consecrations.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>6. <hi>There were no degrees of superior and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior, provincial and general Superintendents: It is otherwise in the Hierarchy of the Prelates,</hi> &amp;c.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>I have set down these six <hi>huge</hi> Differences, without ever offering to consider them particularly; are they not <hi>huge</hi> Differences? Behold them, examine them carefully; is not each of them as <hi>essential</hi> and <hi>specifick</hi> as another?</p>
               <p>Think not, courteous Reader, it was <hi>Malice</hi> or <hi>Ill-will</hi> to Episcopacy, made our Author muster up these Differences: These make but a small number; if he had been acted by <hi>passion</hi> or <hi>vicious Byass,</hi> if his Malice had been vigorous and earnest to discharge it self that way; he could have easily reckoned six hundred, every whit as consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:101025:176"/>
Differences: He might have told them, that Bishops wore <hi>Black Hats,</hi> and Superintendents <hi>Blue Bonnets</hi>; that Bishops wore <hi>Silks,</hi> and Superintendents <hi>Tartan</hi>; that Bishops wore <hi>Gowns</hi> and <hi>Cassocks,</hi> and Superintendents <hi>Trews</hi> and <hi>slasht Doublets</hi>; and God knows, how many such differences he might have readily collected. And if he had adduced such <hi>notable</hi> differences as these, he had done every way as <hi>Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,</hi> and as like a good <hi>Difference-maker.</hi> But in the mean time what is all this to <hi>Parity</hi> or <hi>Imparity</hi> amongst the Governors of the Church? Do these <hi>differences,</hi> he has adduced, <hi>distinguish</hi> between Bishops and Superintendents as to preheminence of <hi>power,</hi> and the essentials of <hi>Prelacy</hi>? Do they prove that Superintendents had no Prerogative, no Authority, no Jurisdiction, over Parish Ministers? I have treated him thus coursly, because I know no other way of treatment Authors deserve, who will needs speak <hi>Nonsense</hi> rather than speak nothing. 'Tis true indeed:</p>
               <p>One difference he has mentioned, which seems something material, and therefore I shall endeavor to account for it with some more seriousness. It is that by the Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, as we have it, both in the <hi>First Book of Discipline,</hi> and the <hi>Form and Order of electing Superintendents, Superintendents were made obnoxious to the Tryal and Censures of the Ministers within their own Diocesses.</hi> This I acknowledge to be true; and I acknowledge
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:101025:177"/>
further, that, herein, there was a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable difference between <hi>them</hi> and <hi>Bishops</hi>; as Bishops stood eminenced above Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the primitive times, and as they ought to stand eminenced above them in all well constituted Churches. But then I have these things to say,</p>
               <p n="1">1. I shall not scruple to acknowledge that, herein, our Reformers were in the wrong; and that this was a great Error in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution. I do avowedly profess, I don't think my self bound to justify every thing that was done by our Reformers: If that falls to any mans share, if falls to theirs who established this <hi>Article</hi> in the <hi>Claim of Right,</hi> which gave occasion to this whole Enquiry. That our Reformers, herein, were in the wrong, I say, I make no scruple to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and I think it cannot but be obvious to all, who have spent but a few thoughts about matters of <hi>Policy</hi> and <hi>Government.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, to make Governours subject to the Censures and Sentences of their Subjects, what is it else than to subvert Government, to confound Relations, to sap the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of all Order and politick Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? <hi>It is</hi> (as <hi>King Iames</hi> the sixth has it in his Discourse about the <hi>true Law of Free Monarchies,</hi> 
                  <note n="(b)" place="margin">K.J. <hi>his Works,</hi> p. 202.</note> and I cannot give it better) <hi>to invert the Order of all Law and Reason; to make the commanded, command the Commander; the judged, judge their Iudge; and them who are governed to govern, their time about, their Lord and Governour.</hi> In short, to give a just
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:101025:177"/>
account of such a Constitution, it is very near of Kin, to that <hi>bantering</hi> Question I have sometimes heard proposed to Children or Ideots, <hi>If you were above me, and I, above you, which of us should, be uppermost</hi>? I add further</p>
               <p n="2">2. That, as I take it, our Reformers put this in the Constitution, that they might appear consequential to a principle, then espoused and put in practice by them, about Civil Government; which was, that the King was superior to his Subjects in their distributive, but inferior to them in their collective Capacity. <note n="†" place="margin">Major singulis, minor uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versis.</note> This principle, I say, in those days was in great Credit: <hi>Knox</hi> had learned it from the <hi>Democratians</hi> at <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva</hi>; his Authority was great, and he was very <hi>fond</hi> of this principle, and disseminated it with a singular zeal and confidence. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, our Reformers were, then, obnoxious to the civil Government; the standing Laws were against them, and the Soveraigns per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, in matters of Religion, jumpt with the Laws. This Principle, therefore, (had it been a good one) came to them most seasonably; and coming to them in such a nick, and withal, meeting, in them, with <hi>Scotch Mettal,</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Praefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidum Scotorum ingenium.</note> they put it in practice; and being put in practice, God suffered it to be successful; and the success was a new Endearment, and so it came to be a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Credit and Reputation. Indeed, they had been very unthankful to it, and inconsequential to boot, if they had not
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:101025:178"/>
adopted it into their <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> as well as their <hi>Civil Systeme</hi>; and the Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, having had a main hand in reducing it to practice against the Prince, could not take it ill if it was made a Law to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; it was but their own measure. This, I say, I take to be the natural History of this part of the Constitution. Nay,</p>
               <p n="3">3. So fond, it seems, they were of this principle, that they extended it further, so far, as even to make Ministers accountable to their own <hi>Elderships.</hi> So 'tis expresly established by the <hi>First Book</hi> of Discipline, Head 8. <note n="(c)" place="margin">Spot. 167.</note> 
                  <hi>The Elders ought also to take heed to the Life, Manners, Diligence and Study of their Minister: And if he be worthy of Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, they must admonish him; if of Correction, they must correct him; and if he be worthy of Deposition, they, with the Consent of the Church and Superintendent, may depose him.</hi> Here was a <hi>pitch</hi> of <hi>Democracy</hi> which, I think, our Presbyterian Brethren themselves, as <hi>self denied</hi> as they are, would not take with, so very kindly. And yet I am apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, the Compilers of the <hi>Book,</hi> never thought on putting these <hi>Elders</hi> in a state of <hi>parity</hi> with their Ministers; tho this is a Demonstration, that they have not been the greatest Masters at <hi>Drawing Schemes</hi> of <hi>Policy.</hi> But to let this pass.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Tho this unpolitical stroke (to call it no worse) was made part of the Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution by that Book, as I have granted; yet I have no where found, that ever it was put
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:101025:178"/>
in practice. I have no where found, that <hi>De Facto</hi> a <hi>Superintendent,</hi> was <hi>judged</hi> by his own <hi>Synod</hi>; whether it was, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved so exactly, as that they were never censureable, or that their <hi>Synods</hi> had not the insolence to reduce a Constitution so very absurd, and unreasonable, to practice, I shall not be anxious to determine. But it seems probable it has been as much, if not more, upon the latter account than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; for I find <hi>Superintendents</hi> frequently tried, and sometimes censured by General Assemblies; and there was reason for it, supposing that General Assemblies, as then constituted, were fit to be the supreme Judicatories of the National Church: For there was no reason that <hi>Superintendents</hi> should have been <hi>Popes, i. e.</hi> absolute and unaccountable; so that, if I am not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken, our Brethren <hi>raise Dust,</hi> to little purpose, when they make so much noise about the Accountableness of Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents to General Assemblies, as if that made a difference between them and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops: For I know no man that makes Bishops unaccountable, especially when they are <hi>confederated</hi> in a <hi>National</hi> Church. But this by the way: That which I take notice of is, That seeing we find they were so frequently tried by <hi>General Assemblies,</hi> without the least intimation of their being, at any time, tried by their own <hi>Synods,</hi> it seems reasonable to conclude, that it has been thought fit to let that unreasonable
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:101025:179"/>
                  <hi>Stretch</hi> in the first Constitution fall into <hi>Dissuetude:</hi> But however this was, I have all safe enough. For</p>
               <p n="5">5. Such a Constitution infers no such thing as <hi>parity</hi> amongst the Officers of the Church. Those who maintain, that the King is <hi>inferiour</hi> to his Subjects, in their <hi>Collection,</hi> are not yet so <hi>extravagant</hi> as to say, he is not <hi>superior</hi> to every <hi>one</hi> of them in their <hi>Distribution</hi>: They acknowledge he is <hi>Major Singulis</hi>; and there's not a person in the Kingdom, who will be so <hi>unmannerly</hi> as to say, that he stands upon the same <hi>Level</hi> with his <hi>Soveraign.</hi> But what needs more? These same very Presbyterian Authors, who use this Argument, even <hi>while</hi> they use it, confess, That <hi>Superintendents,</hi> and ordinary <hi>Parish Ministers,</hi> did not <hi>act</hi> in <hi>parity</hi>; and because they <hi>cannot</hi> deny it, but <hi>must</hi> confess it, whether they will or not, they cannot forbear raising all the Dust they can about it, that unthinking People may not see clearly that they do confess it. And had it not been for this reason, I am apt to think, the world had never been plagued with such pitiful <hi>jangle,</hi> as such Arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to. Neither is the next any better, which is,</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That Superintendency was never established by Act of Parliament.</hi> This is G. <hi>R.</hi>'s Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his learned Answer to the first of the ten Questions; for there he tells us, That <hi>Superintendency was neither brought in, nor cast out, by Act of Parliament.</hi> And what
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:101025:179"/>
then? Doth he love it the worse that it was established, purely, by Ecclesiastical Authority? How long since he turn'd <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ond</hi> of <hi>Parliamentary</hi> Establishments? I wonder he was not affraid of the <hi>Scandal</hi> of <hi>Erastia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism.</hi> But to the point: 'Tis true indeed, it was not brought in by Act of Parliament; but then, I think, he himself cannot deny, that it was countenanced, allowed and approven, by more than <hi>half a Dozen</hi> of Acts of Parliaments; which, if our Author understands any thing either of <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,</hi> he must allow to be, at least, <hi>equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi> to a Parliamentary <hi>In-bringing.</hi> I have these Acts in readiness to produce, when I shall be put to it: But I think his own Act which he cited (tho most ridiculously, as shall be made appear afterwards) in the immediately preceeding paragraph, may be good enough for <hi>him.</hi>
                  <q>For, <hi>He</hi> concludes it as evident, that Episcopal Jurisdiction over the Protestants, was condemned by Law in the Parliament 1567. because it is, there, <hi>statute and ordained, that no other Iurisdiction Ecclesiastical be acknowledged within this Realm, than that which is, and shall be, within this same Kirk, established presently, or which sloweth therefrom, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preaching the Word, correcting of Manners, administration of Sacraments</hi>; and Prelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Jurisdiction was not then in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </q>
So he reasons. Now I dare adventure to refer it to his own judgment, whither it will not, by the same way of reasoning,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:101025:180"/>
follow, and be <hi>as evident,</hi> that the <hi>Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of Superintendents</hi> was allowed of, by this same Act, seeing he himself cannot have the <hi>Brow</hi> to deny, that it was, then, in its vigor, and daily exercised? I think this is Argument good enough, <hi>ad hominem</hi>; But, as I said, we shall have more of this Act of Parliament hereafter.</p>
               <p>Thus I have dispelled some of these clouds our Presbyterian Brethren use to raise about the <hi>Prelacy</hi> of <hi>Superintendents</hi>; perhaps there may be more of them, but, considering the weakness of these, which, certainly, are the strongest, it is easy to conjecture what the rest may be, if there are any more of them. And thus, I think, I have fairly accounted for the Sentiments of our Reformers, in relation to <hi>Parity</hi> or <hi>Imparity</hi> amongst the Governors of the Church, during the <hi>First Scheme</hi> into which they cast the Government of the Church.</p>
               <p>BEFORE I proceed to the next, I must go back a little, and give a brief De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of some things which may afford considerable Light, both to what I am now to insist on, and what I have insisted on already.</p>
               <p>Tho I am most unwilling to rake into the Mistakes or Weaknesses of our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, yet I cannot but say, that our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was carried on, and, at first esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished upon some principles, very disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to the Church, both as to her <hi>Polity</hi> and <hi>Patrimony.</hi> There were Mistakes in
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:101025:180"/>
the Ministers on the one hand, and sinister and worldly designs amongst the Laity, on the other: and both concurred unhappily, to produce Great Evils in the Result.</p>
               <p>There was a principle had, then, got too much sooting amongst some Protestant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, <hi>viz.</hi> That the best way to reform a Church, was to recede as far from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists as they could; to have nothing in common with them, but the Essentials; the necessary and indispensable Articles and Parts of Christian Religion; whatever was, in its nature indifferent, and not positively and expresly commanded in the Scriptures, if it was in fashion in the Popish Churches, was therefore to be laid aside, and avoided as a Corruption; as having been abused, and made subservient to Superstition and Idolatry.</p>
               <p>This principle <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> was fond of, and maintained zealously; and the rest of our reforming Preachers were much acted by his Influences. In pursuance of this principle, therefore, when they compiled the First Book of Discipline, they would not reform the Old Polity, and purge it of such Corruptions as had crept into it, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing still by the main Draughts and Linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of it; which undoubtedly had been the wiser, the safer, and every way the better course, as they were then admonisht, even by some of the <hi>Popish</hi> Clergy: <note n="(a)" place="margin">Spot. 174.</note> But they laid it quite aside, and instead thereof hammered out a <hi>New Scheme,</hi> keeping at as

               <p>That our Reformers had the aforesaid principle in their view, all alongst, while they digested the <hi>First Book of Discipline,</hi> is plain to every one that reads it. Thus,</p>
               <p>In the <hi>First Head,</hi> they condemn <hi>Binding Men and Women to a several and disguised Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel; to the superstitious observing of Fasting Days— Keeping of holy days of certain Saints, commanded by Man, such as be all these THE PAPISTS HAVE INVENTED, as the Feasts of the Apostles, Martyrs,</hi> Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, &amp;c. <note n="(b)" place="margin">Ib. 153.</note> In the <hi>Second</hi> Head, <hi>The Cross in Baptism</hi> and <hi>Kneeling</hi> at the Reception of the Symbols, in the <hi>Eucharist.</hi> In the <hi>Third Head,</hi> they require not only <hi>Idolatry,</hi> but <hi>all its Monuments and Places to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed</hi>; and amongst the rest, <hi>Chappels, Cathedral Churches, and Colleges, i. e.</hi> as I take it, <hi>Collegiate Churches.</hi> And many other such instances might be adduced; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, as to our present purpose: They would not call those, whom they truly and really, stated in a <hi>Prelacy</hi> above their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <hi>Prelates</hi> or <hi>Bishops,</hi> but <hi>Superintendents</hi>:
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:101025:181"/>
They would not allow of <hi>Imposition of hands</hi> in <hi>Ordinations:</hi> They made <hi>Superintendents</hi> subject to the <hi>Censures</hi> of their own <hi>Synods</hi>; they changed the <hi>bounds</hi> of the <hi>Diocesses</hi>; they would not allow the <hi>Superintendents</hi> the <hi>same</hi> Revenues which <hi>Prelates</hi> had had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: They would not suffer <hi>Ecclesiastical Benefices</hi> to stand <hi>distinguished</hi> as they had been formerly; but they were for casting them all, for <hi>once,</hi> into <hi>one</hi> heap, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a new Division of the Churches Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, and parcelling it out in Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencies, as they thought it most expedient. In short,</p>
               <p>A notable instance of the prevalency of this principle we have, even in the year 1572. after the Restauration of the <hi>Old Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> was agreed to.

               <p>
                  <hi>Knox</hi> (and <hi>Calderwood</hi> follows him) says, <note n="(e)" place="margin">Kn. 283. Cald. 24.</note> it was written after the Dissolution of the Parliament, which sate in <hi>August</hi> 1560. and gave the legal Establishment to the Reformation. But <hi>Petrie</hi> 
                  <note n="(f)" place="margin">Pet. 218.</note> says, it is expresly affirmed in the beginning of the <hi>Book</hi> it self that the Commission was granted for compiling it on the 29th of <hi>April,</hi> 1560. and that they brought it to a Conclusion, <hi>as they could for the time,</hi> before the 20th of <hi>May</hi> (a short enough time, I think, for a work of such importance.) So <hi>Petrie</hi> affirms, I say, and it is apparent he is in the right; for, his account agrees exactly with the <hi>First</hi> Nomination of <hi>Superintendents,</hi> which both <hi>Knox</hi> and <hi>Spotswood</hi> affirm to have been made in <hi>Iuly,</hi> that year. <note n="(g)" place="margin">Kn. 259, 260.

the Parliament sate, according to this account, makes it fairly intelligible, how it was intirely neglected, or rather rejected, not only, so far, as that it was never al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of nor approven by them, as we shall learn by and by; but, so far, that, in that Parliament no provision, at all, was made for the Maintainance and Subsistence of the Reformed Ministers. For under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing this more fully, yet,</p>
               <p>It is to be considered, that there had been Disceptations and Controversies the year before, <hi>viz.</hi> 1559. about the Disposal of the <hi>Patrimony</hi> of the Church. This I learn from a Letter of <hi>Knox</hi>'s to <hi>Calvin,</hi> (dated <hi>August</hi> 28. 1559. to be seen amongst <hi>Calvin</hi>'s <hi>Epistles, Col.</hi> 441.) wherein he asks his sentiments about this question, <hi>Whither the yearly Revenues might be payed to such as had been Monks and Popish Priests, even tho they should confess their former errors, considering that they neither served the Church, nor were capable to do it</hi>? And tells him frankly,<note place="margin">Haec, quia nego, plus ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quo severus judicor, non a solis Papisticls, verum etiam ab ijs qui sibi vori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis patroni videntur.</note> that he had main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the negative, for which he was called too severe, not only by the Papists, but even by many Protestants. From which 'tis plain, not only that there were, then, Controversies about the Disposal of the Patrimony of the Church, as I have said, but also, that <hi>Knox</hi> (and by very probable consequence, the Protestant Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, generally) was clear, that the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:101025:183"/>
Revenues had been primarily desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to the Church for the ends of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and therefore whatever person could not serve these ends, could have no <hi>just Title</hi> to these <hi>Revenues:</hi> By which way of reasoning, not only ignorant <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Monks,</hi> but all <hi>Lay men</hi> whatsoever, were excluded from having any <hi>Title</hi> to the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> Now,</p>
               <p>While this Controversie was in agitation, as to point of <hi>Right,</hi> the Guise was going against <hi>Knox</hi>'s side of it, as to matter of <hi>Fact.</hi> For, in the mean time, many <hi>Abbeys</hi> and <hi>Monasteries</hi> were thrown down, and the Nobility and Gentry were daily posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing themselves of the <hi>Estates</hi> that had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to them; and so before the <hi>First Book of Discipline,</hi> (which was <hi>Knox</hi>'s per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, and so, no doubt, contain'd his principle) was compiled, <hi>they</hi> were finding that there was something <hi>sweet</hi> in <hi>sacrilege,</hi> and were by no means willing to part with what they had got, so fortunately, as they thought, in their Fingers. Besides, They foresaw, if <hi>Knox</hi>'s project took place, seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other, which they judged considerable, inconvenients would follow: If the <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Priests,</hi> &amp;c. who acknowledged their former errors, should be so treated, what might <hi>they</hi> expect, who <hi>persisted</hi> in their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to the <hi>Romish Faith</hi> and <hi>Interests</hi>? Tho they were blinded with Superstition and Error, yet they were <hi>Men,</hi> they were <hi>Scottish men</hi>; nay they were generally of their
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:101025:183"/>
own <hi>Blood,</hi> and their very near <hi>Kinsmen:</hi> And would it not be very hard to deprive them intirely of their Livings, and reduce them, who had their Estates settled upon them by Law, and had lived so plentifully and so hospitably, to such ane <hi>Hopeless</hi> State of <hi>Misery</hi> and <hi>Arrant Beggary</hi>? Further, by this <hi>Scheme,</hi> as they behoved to part with what they had already <hi>griped,</hi> so their Hopes of ever having opportunity to profit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of the Revenues of the Church, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, were more effectually discouraged, than they had been even in the times of <hi>Popery</hi>: The <hi>Popish Clergy,</hi> by their <hi>Rules,</hi> were bound to live <hi>single,</hi> they could not <hi>marry,</hi> nor, by consequence, have <hi>lawful Children</hi> to provide for. The reformed, as the law of God allowed them, and their Inclinations prompted them, indulged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the <hi>Solaces</hi> of <hi>Wedlock,</hi> and begot Children, and had Families to maintain and provide for; there were no such Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, therefore, of easy Leases, and rich Gifts, and hidden Legacies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from them, as from the <hi>Popish</hi> Clergy. Add to this, the <hi>Popish</hi> Clergy foresaw the <hi>Ruine</hi> of the <hi>Romish</hi> Interests; they saw no likelihood of <hi>Successors,</hi> of their own <hi>Stamp</hi> and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. They had a mighty <hi>spite</hi> at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. It was not likely, therefore, that they would be <hi>anxious</hi> what became of the <hi>Patrimony</hi> of the Church, after they were gone. It was to be hoped they might squander it away, dilapidate, alienate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:101025:184"/>
without difficulty; (as indeed they did) And who but themselves (the Laity) should have all this <hi>gain?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon these and the like Considerations, I say, the Nobility and Gentry had no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to the <hi>First Book of Discipline</hi>; And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once out of Love with it, it was easy to get Arguments enough against it: The <hi>Novelties,</hi> and the numerous <hi>needless Reces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> from the <hi>Old</hi> Polity, which were in it, furnished these both obviously and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly. So it was not only not established, but, it seems, the Nobility and Gentry, who have ever the principal sway in <hi>Scottish</hi> Parliaments, to let the Ministers find how much they had displeased them, by such a <hi>Draught, resolved</hi> to <hi>serve</hi> them a <hi>Trick.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they <hi>served</hi> them a <hi>monstrous one</hi>; for tho in the Parliament, 1560. they esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished the Reformation, as to <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Worship,</hi> &amp;c. and by a <hi>Legal Definition,</hi> made the <hi>Protestant</hi> the <hi>National</hi> Church, yet they settled not so much as a <hi>Groat</hi> of the Churches <hi>Revenues</hi> upon its <hi>Ministers,</hi> but continued the <hi>Popish</hi> Clergy, during their Lives, in their possessions.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, indeed, thro the importunity of <hi>I. Knox,</hi> and some others of the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, some Noblemen and Gentlemen sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed the <hi>Book</hi> in <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1560/1. <note n="(h)" place="margin">Kn. 282, 283.

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:101025:184"/>
Priors, and other Prelates, and Beneficed Men, who had already joyned themselves to the Religion, should enjoy the Rents of their Benefices, during their Lives, they sustaining the Ministers for their parts,</hi> &amp;c. But it was never generally received; on the contrary it was treated in <hi>Ridicule,</hi> and called a <hi>DEVOVT IMA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GINATION,</hi> which offended <hi>Knox</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly. <note n="(i)" place="margin">Kn. lb. Spot. 174.</note> Nay, it seems, the Ministers themselves were not generally pleased with it, after second thoughts, or, The Laity have been more numerous in the <hi>General Assembly</hi> holden in <hi>December</hi> 1561. For (as <hi>Knox</hi> himself tells us <note n="(k)" place="margin">Kn. 323.</note>) when it was moved, there, that the Book should be offered to the Queen, and her Majesty should be supplicated to ratify it, the Motion was rejected.</p>
               <p>The Reformation thus established, and through the <hi>Badness,</hi> or, at least, the <hi>Disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeableness</hi> of the <hi>Scheme</hi> laid down in the <hi>Book</hi> on the one hand, and the <hi>Selfish</hi> and <hi>Sacrilegious</hi> Ends of the <hi>Laity</hi> on the other, no provision made for the Ministers; it was unavoidable that they should be <hi>pincht.</hi> And <hi>pincht</hi> they were, indeed, to purpose; For, for full <hi>Eighteen</hi> or <hi>Nineteen Months,</hi> after the Reformation was established by Law, they had nothing to live by, but <hi>Shift</hi> or <hi>Charity</hi>; and, which heightned the Misery, all this time of <hi>Want,</hi> they had little or no prospect of the end of it: For when a Parliament, so much <hi>Protestant,</hi> as in the <hi>Queens</hi> absence, to establish the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:101025:185"/>
                  <hi>Purity</hi> of <hi>Doctrine, &amp;c.</hi> had treated them so unkindly, what was to be expected, now that <hi>she</hi> was at home, every <hi>inch</hi> Popish, and zealously such? Tho a Parliament should now incline to pity them, yet how could it meet? Or what could it do without the Soveraigns Allowance? And what ground had they to hope that she would be friend them? Indeed, nothing was to be attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that way; it was not to be expected that the <hi>Popish</hi> Clergy should be dispossessed of the Revenues of the Church, and the Reformed entituled to them, by Act of Parliament. Another <hi>project</hi> was to be fallen upon.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Project</hi> fallen upon was, That the <hi>Council,</hi> then, intirely <hi>Protestant,</hi> should deal with the <hi>Queen</hi> to oblige the <hi>Popish</hi> Clergy, Possessors of the Benefices, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign the <hi>Thirds</hi> of them, into her Majesties hands, that they might be a <hi>fond</hi> for the Maintainance of the <hi>Protestant Ministers,</hi> The Nation was, then, <hi>generally</hi> Protestant, and that <hi>Interest</hi> was too <hi>strong</hi> for the <hi>Queen,</hi> so that they were not to be too much <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokt</hi>: Besides, one Argument was used which prevailed much with her Majesty. The Revenues of the Queen were, then, very low, and she loved to spend; and pains were taken to perswade her that, beside what would be subsistence enough for the Ministers, she would be sure to have what might considerably relieve her own Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. This was a taking proposition, so,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:101025:185"/>
the project succeeded. The <hi>Popish Clergy</hi> were put to it, and resign'd the <hi>Thirds.</hi> 
                  <note n="(l)" place="margin">Kn. 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, &amp;c. fuse.</note> Collectors were appointed to bring them in to the <hi>Exchequer</hi>: The Ministers, were, <hi>thence,</hi> to receive their Allowances. Well!</p>
               <p>Were they well enough provided now? Alas! Poor Men! It was but little that was pretended to be provided for them; the <hi>Thirds</hi> of these Benefices which the <hi>Laity</hi> had not already <hi>swallowed:</hi> And yet far less was their <hi>real</hi> portion. They found by sad experience that it was not for nothing, that the <hi>Thirds</hi> were ordered to be brought into the <hi>Queens</hi> Treasury. For when they came to be divided, how mean were their Allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? Ane hundred <hi>Merks Scottish, i. e.</hi> about 5 <hi>l.</hi> 11 <hi>sh. English,</hi> to ane ordinary Minister in the Country. <hi>Three hundred</hi> (saith <hi>Knox</hi> 
                  <note n="(m)" place="margin">p. 329.</note>) <hi>was the highest that was appointed to any, except the Superintendents, and a few others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All this, the Ministers, indeed, resented highly. <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> 
                  <note n="(n)" place="margin">Ib.</note> said publickly in his Sermon, <hi>If that Order for maintaining the Ministers ended well, his judgment failed him— for he saw two parts freely given to the Devil,</hi> (the Popish Clergy) <hi>and the third must be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided betwixt God and the Devil, i. e.</hi> betwixt <hi>the Protestant Ministers,</hi> and the <hi>Popish Queen.</hi> And, no doubt, her Share was truely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable. But neither did the Misery end here: As poor as these small <hi>Pittances</hi> were, they could not have them either <hi>seasonably,</hi> or <hi>fully</hi> paid. The <hi>Thirds</hi> came in but <hi>slowly,</hi>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:101025:186"/>
and the <hi>Queens Necessities</hi> behoved to be first served; by which means, the Ministers were forced to wait, many times, very long, for their Money: And, sometimes, to take <hi>little,</hi> rather than want <hi>all</hi>: In short, their sense of the treatment they met with was so lively, that this turn'd to a <hi>Proverb,</hi> amongst them: <hi>The Good Laird of</hi> Pittaro <hi>was ane Earnest Professor of Christ; but the Great Devil receive the Controller.</hi> 
                  <note n="(o)" place="margin">Ibid.</note> Thus, poor Men! they were hardly treated: they had great Charges, and a weighty Task; and they were <hi>ill</hi> provided, and <hi>worse</hi> paid.</p>
               <p>This bred them much work in their Gen. Assemblies: For, scarcely did they ever meet, but a great part of their time was spent in forming <hi>Petitions,</hi> and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuning the Government for Relief of their Necessities; but all in vain, they were never the better, no not so much as <hi>heard,</hi> almost, till <hi>Iuly</hi> 1567. Then, the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Gentry, resolved to lay aside the Queen from the Government, and finding it necessary to have the Ministers of their side, began to bespeak them a little more kindly. Then, indeed, it was made the <hi>Second Article</hi> of that <hi>League,</hi> into which they entered, <hi>That the Act already made</hi> (by the Queen and Council) <hi>concerning the Thirds of the Benefices within this Realm, principally, for sustaining the Ministers, should be duely put in Execution, according to the Order of the Book of the Appointment of Ministers Stipends, as
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:101025:186"/>
well of them that are to be appointed, as of them who are already placed, and that the Ministers should be first duely answered, and sufficiently sustained, of the same, to the Relief of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Necessity, ay and while a perfect Order might be ta'ne, and established, towards the full Distribution of the Patrimony of the Kirk, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods word,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>So I read in the <hi>Mss.</hi> and <hi>Spotswood</hi> 
                  <note n="(p)" place="margin">Spot. 209.</note> has the same upon the matter. But this was not all, <hi>Burnt Bairns Fire dread.</hi> The Ministers sensible, it seems, of the <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>uncertain</hi> way of <hi>Living,</hi> they had had before, resolved now to make the best advantage they could of that opportunity; and so they obtain'd this likewise for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Article</hi> of that <hi>Confederacy,</hi> and the Nobility promised, <hi>That how soon a lawful Parliament might be had, or that the Occasion might otherwise justly serve, they should labour at their uttermost, that the Faithful Kirk of Iesus Christ, professed within this Realm, might be put in full Liberty</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> possession) <hi>of the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Kirk, according to the Book of God, and the Order and Practice of the Primitive Kirk, and that nothing should pass in Parliament, till the Affairs of the Kirk were first considered, approved and established; and also, that they should reform themselves, in the Matters of the Church, for their own parts; Ordaining the Contraveeners and Refusers of the same to be secluded from the Bosom of the Kirk,</hi> &amp;c. So the <hi>Mss.</hi> and <hi>Spotswood</hi> also. <note n="(q)" place="margin">Ibid.</note>

               <p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:101025:187"/>Here were fair promises indeed! Were not the Ministers well enough secured now? Was not the <hi>Patrimony</hi> of the Church, now, to <hi>run</hi> in its <hi>Right Channel</hi>? Alas! All pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises are not performed. No sooner had these Nobles and Barons carried their main point, which was the <hi>dethroning</hi> of the <hi>Queen,</hi> (to which also the Ministers were forward enough) than they quite forgot their promises. For, tho the Parliament met in <hi>December,</hi> thereafter, and tho the Restitution of the <hi>Patrimony</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> was promised to be the <hi>first thing</hi> that should be done in Parliament, yet nothing like performance! Nay, tho ane Act was made for putting the <hi>Articles</hi> about the <hi>Thirds</hi> in Execution; yet, the Ministers were forced to wait long enough, before they found the effects of it. In short, they continued in the same straits they had been in before, for full two years thereafter, that is, till <hi>Iuly</hi> 1569. at which time, I find by the <hi>Mss.</hi> and <hi>Mr. Petrie</hi> 
                  <note n="(r)" place="margin">Pet. 363.</note> the Church was put in possession of the <hi>Thirds</hi>; for which their Necessities made them very thankful, as appears from the Narrative of ane Act of their Assembly at that time, which runs thus, as I find it in the Mss. <hi>For asmuch as this long time by gone, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters have been universally defrauded and post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned of their Stipends, and, now, at last, it hath pleased God to move the hearts of the supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour power, and the Estates of this Realm,</hi> &amp;c.

would not have used when the <hi>Thirds</hi> were, at first, <hi>projected</hi> for their Maintainance: Sure, I am, of a quite different strain from <hi>Knox</hi>'s Resentment, which I mentioned before. But by this time, Experience had taught them <hi>to thank God for little</hi>; and that it was even <hi>Good to be getting something.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,</p>
               <p>All this while they continued still to have the same sentiments concerning the <hi>Patrimony</hi> of the Church; that, unless God by immediate Revolution, should <hi>dispense</hi> with her <hi>Right,</hi> it belong'd to her <hi>unaliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi>; that it was <hi>abominable Sacriledge</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud her of it; and that neither <hi>Church</hi> nor <hi>State</hi> could be <hi>happy</hi> so long as <hi>it</hi> was so much in the hands of <hi>Laicks.</hi> And as they had still these <hi>sentiments,</hi> (and no wonder, so long as they had any <hi>sense</hi> of Religion) so, they were still using their best endeavours, trying all experiments, and watching all opportunities to bring the Nobility and Gentry to a reasonable Temper; and to put the Church in possession of her undoubted Revenues; but all in vain. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, these <hi>Leeches</hi> having once <hi>tasted</hi> of her <hi>Blood,</hi> were <hi>thirsting</hi> still for <hi>more,</hi> and daily making farther Encroachments.

               <p>
                  <q>A Parliament met in <hi>August</hi> 1571, and made ane Act, obliging all the Subjects, who in former times, had held their Land and Possessions of Priors, Prioresses, Convents of Friers and Nuns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to hold them of the Crown. This
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:101025:188"/>
was ane awakening, ane allaruming Act. These who, heretofore, had possest themselves of the Churches Patrimony, had done it by <hi>force,</hi> or by <hi>connivance</hi>; without <hi>Law,</hi> and without <hi>Title</hi>; so there were still hopes of recovering what was possest so <hi>illegally.</hi>
                  </q>
But this was to give them <hi>Law</hi> on their side; As things stood then, it would be easy to obtain <hi>Gifts,</hi> now, that the King was made immediate Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour; and then, there was no recovering of what was thus <hi>colourably</hi> possessed. So, I say it was ane <hi>awakening Act</hi> of Parliament; and indeed it <hi>rouzed</hi> the Spirits of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and put them in a <hi>quicker</hi> motion. Now they began to see the Error of Drawing the <hi>New Scheme</hi> of <hi>Polity</hi> in the <hi>First Book</hi> of <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,</hi> and receding from the <hi>Old one</hi>: Now they perceived sensibly that, that making of a <hi>New one,</hi> had <hi>unhinged</hi> all the Churches <hi>Interests,</hi> and <hi>exposed</hi> her <hi>Patrimony,</hi> and made it a <hi>Prey</hi> to the <hi>Ravenous Laity</hi>; and that it was therefore, time, high time, for them to bethink themselves, and try their strength and skill, if possibly a stop could be put to such notorious Robbery. <note n="(s)" place="margin">Vide Spot. 258.</note> And so I am fairly introduced to</p>
               <p>THE SECOND MODEL into which the Government of the Church was cast, after the publick Establishment of the Reformation. For</p>
               <p>The <hi>General Assembly</hi> of the Church, meeting at <hi>Stirling,</hi> in that same month of

<q>Gave Commission to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Brethren, to go to the Lord Regent his Grace, and to the Parliament, humbly to request and desire, in Name of the Kirk, the granting of such Heads and Articles, and redress of such Complaints, as should be given to them by the Kirk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
So it is in the <hi>Mss.</hi> and so <hi>Spotswood</hi> and <hi>Petrie</hi> have it. <note n="(t)" place="margin">Spot. 258. Pet. 371.</note> Before I proceed, there is one seeming difficulty which must be removed; it is, that this <hi>General Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> met before the Parliament. How then could it be that Act of Parliament which so awakened them? But the Solution is easy. In those times, Parliaments did not sit so long as they are in use to do now; but all things were prepared, and in readiness, before the Parliament met.
<q>Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made a month, or so, before the Parliament was to meet, requiring all <hi>Bills</hi> to be given in to the <hi>Register,</hi> which were to be presented in the succeeding Session of Parliament, that they might be brought to the <hi>King,</hi> or <hi>Regent,</hi> to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>used and considered by them, and only such as they allowed were to be put into the <hi>Chancellors</hi> hands to be proponed to the Parliament, and none other, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Whoso pleases may see this account given by King <hi>Iames</hi> the <hi>Sixth</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>First</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> to his <hi>English</hi> Parliament, in his <hi>Speech</hi> dated 1607. Indeed the thing is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, and <hi>Calderwood</hi> himself gives a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable instance of this method, <note n="(u)" place="margin">Cald. 759.</note> for

he tells how, in the end of <hi>April,</hi> or begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>May</hi> 1621. <hi>A Charge was published by Proclamation, commanding all that had Suits, Articles, or Petitions to propone to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to give them into the Clerk of the Register before the twentieth day of</hi> May, <hi>that by him they might be presented to so many of the Council, who were appointed by his Majesty to meet, some days before the Parliament, and to consider the said Bills, Petitions and Articles with Certifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the same should not be received, read, nor voted in Parliament, except they were passed under his Highness hand.</hi> And yet the same <hi>Calderwood</hi> tells us, <note n="(v)" place="margin">Ib. 764.</note> That the Parliament was not appointed to meet till the <hi>Twentieth and Third of Iuly</hi>; so that here were <hi>two full months</hi> between the giving in of the Bills, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Meeting of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This being the Custom in those times, it is easy to consider how the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Assembly, tho it met some days before the Parliament, might know very well what was to be done in Parliament; for if this <hi>Bill</hi> was allowed by the <hi>then</hi> Regent to be presented, there was no doubt of its passing. And that it was very well known what the Parliament was to do in that matter, may be further evident from <hi>Iohn Knox</hi>'s Letter directed, at that time, to the General Assembly, wherein he is earnest with them, that <hi>with all Vprightness and Strength in God, they gainst and the mercyless Devourers of the Patrimony of the Church, telling them, that if Men will spoil, let them do it to
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:101025:189"/>
their own Peril and Damnation; but it was their Duty to beware of communicating with their sins, but by publick protestation to make it known to the world, That they were innocent of Robbery, which would, e're long, provoke Gods Vengeance upon the Committers,</hi> &amp;c. From which nothing can be clearer, than that he had a special eye to that which was then in agitation, and to be done by the Parliament. <note n="(*)" place="margin">
                     <hi>For this Letter see</hi> Spot. 258. <hi>and</hi> Pet. 370.</note> Having thus removed this seeming difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I return to my purpose.</p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Lennox</hi> was, then, <hi>Regent</hi>: He was murthered in the time of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: So, at that time, things were in confusion, and these Commissioners from the General Assembly could do nothing in their business. The <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Mar</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in the <hi>Regency</hi>; Application was made to him. It was agreed to between his <hi>Grace,</hi> and the <hi>Clergy</hi> who applied to him, that a Meeting should be kept be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween so many for the <hi>Church,</hi> and so many for the <hi>State,</hi> for adjusting matters. For this end, ane Assembly was kept at <hi>Leith,</hi> on the 12 of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1571/2. By this Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, <hi>Six</hi> were delegated to meet, with as <hi>many</hi> to be nominated by the <hi>Council to treat, reason and conclude, concerning the Settlement of the Polity of the Church. After diverse Meetings, and long Deliberation,</hi> (as <hi>Spotswood</hi> has it, <note n="(w)" place="margin">Spot. 260.</note>) <hi>they came to an Agreement,</hi> which was, in effect, That the <hi>Old Polity</hi> should <hi>revive,</hi> and take place; only with some little alterations, which seemed necessary
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:101025:190"/>
from the Change that had been made in Religion. Whoso pleases may see it more largely in <hi>Calderwood,</hi>

                  <note n="(y)" place="margin">Spot. 260. Pet. 273.</note> In short,</p>
               <p>It was a Constitution, much the same with that, which we have, ever since, had, in the times of <hi>Episcopacy.</hi> For by this Agreement, those who were to have the <hi>Old Prelatical power,</hi> were also to have the <hi>Old Prelatical Names</hi> and <hi>Titles,</hi> of <hi>Archbishops</hi> and <hi>Bishops</hi>; the <hi>Old Division</hi> of the <hi>Diocesses</hi> was to take place; the <hi>Patrimony</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> was to <hi>run,</hi> much, in the <hi>Old Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel</hi>; particularly, express provision was made concerning <hi>Chapters, Abbots, Priors,</hi> &amp;c. That they should be continued, and enjoy their <hi>Old Rights</hi> and <hi>Priviledges,</hi> as <hi>Churchmen</hi>; and, generally, things were put in a regular Course.</p>
               <p>This was the <hi>Second Model</hi> (not a <hi>new</hi> one) of <hi>Polity,</hi> established, in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> after the Reformation; at a pretty good distance, I think, from the Rules and Exigencies of <hi>Parity.</hi> The truth is, both <hi>Calderwood</hi> and <hi>Petrie</hi> acknowledge, it was <hi>Imparity,</hi> with a witness. The thing was so manifest, they had not the <hi>brow</hi> to deny it; all their Endeavours are only to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne the Authority of this Constitution, or raise Clouds about it, or find Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses in it. So far as I can collect, no man ever affirmed, that, at this time, the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:101025:190"/>
of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> was <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian,</hi> except <hi>G. R.</hi> who is truly singular for his skill in these matters: But we shall have, some time or other, occasion to consider him. In the mean time let us consider <hi>Calderwood</hi>'s and <hi>Petrie</hi>'s <hi>Pleas</hi> against this Establishment. They may be reduced to these four.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>The Incompetency of the Authority of the Meeting at</hi> Leith, <hi>in</hi> January 1571/2.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>The</hi> Force <hi>which was, at that time, put upon the Ministers by the</hi> Court, <hi>which would needs have that Establishment take place.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>The Limitedness of the power, then, granted to Bishops.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. <hi>The Reluctancies which the subsequent Assemblies discovered against that Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>These are the most material <hi>Pleas,</hi> they insist on, and I shall consider, how far they may hold. The</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Plea</hi> is, the Incompetency of the Authority of the Meeting at <hi>Leith, Ian.</hi> 12. 1571/2. which gave Commission to the <hi>Six</hi> for agreeing with the <hi>State</hi> to such ane Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<q>
                     <hi>It is not called ane Assembly, but a Convention, in the Register.</hi> The ordinary Assembly was not appointed to be holden till the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> thereafter.<note n="(a)" place="margin">Cal. 49. Pet. 372.</note> As it was only a Convention, so it was in very great haste, it seems, and took not time to consider things of such importance, so deliberately, as they ought to have been considered. <note n="(b)" place="margin">Cal. 50. Pet. 373, 374.</note> It was a corrupt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:101025:191"/>
for it allowed Master <hi>Robert Pont,</hi> a Minister, to be a Lord of the Session.</q>
                  <note n="(c)" place="margin">Cal. 50. Pet. 375.</note> These are the Reasons they insist on to prove the Authority of that Meeting <hi>incompetent.</hi> And now to examine them briefly.</p>
               <p>When I consider these Arguments, and for what end they are adduced, I must declare, I cannot but admire the <hi>Force</hi> of <hi>prejudice</hi> and <hi>partiality,</hi> how much they <hi>blind</hi> mens Eyes, and <hi>distort</hi> their Reasons, and <hi>byass</hi> them to the most ridiculous Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings. For,</p>
               <p>What tho the next ordinary Assembly was not appointed to meet till <hi>March</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after? Do not even the Presbyterians themselves maintain the <hi>Lawfulness,</hi> yea, the <hi>Necessity</hi> of calling General Assemblies ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily, upon extraordinary occasions? <hi>pro re nata</hi> (as they call it)? How many, such, have been called since the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? How much did they insist on this pretence <hi>Anno</hi> 1638? And,</p>
               <p>What tho the <hi>Register</hi> calls this Meeting a <hi>Convention</hi>? was it therefore no <hi>Assembly</hi>? Is there such an opposition between the words, <hi>Convention</hi> and <hi>Assembly,</hi> that both cannot possibly signify the <hi>same thing</hi>? Doth not <hi>Calderwood</hi> acknowledge, that they <hi>voted</hi> themselves ane Assembly, in their second Session? Doth he not acknowledge, that all the ordinary Members were there, which used to constitute Assemblies? But what if it can be found that ane undoubted,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:101025:191"/>
uncontroverted Assembly, own'd it as ane As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly; and its Authority, as the Authority of ane Assembly? What is become of this <hi>fine</hi> Argument then? But can this be done indeed? Yes, it can; and these same very Authors have given it in these same very Histories <note n="(d)" place="margin">Cal. 57. Pet. 376.</note>, in which they use this as ane Argument, and not very far from the same very pages. Both of them (I say) tell, that the General Assembly holden at <hi>Perth,</hi> in <hi>August</hi> immediately thereafter, made ane Act which began thus, <hi>Forasmuch as the Assembly holden in</hi> Leith, <hi>in</hi> January <hi>last,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But if it was ane Assembly, yet, <hi>it was in too great haste,</hi> it did not things deliberately. Why so? No Reason is adduced, no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son can be adduced, for saying so. The <hi>Subject</hi> they were to treat of was no <hi>new one</hi>; it was a Subject that had imployed all their Heads for several months before: Their great business, at that time, was to give a Commission to <hi>some Members</hi> to meet with the <hi>Delegates</hi> of the <hi>State,</hi> to adjust matters about the <hi>Polity</hi> and <hi>Patrimony</hi> of the Church. This Commission was not given till the <hi>Third Session,</hi> as <hi>Calderwood</hi> himself acknowledges. <note n="(e)" place="margin">Cal. 49.</note> Where then, was the great <hi>haste</hi>? Lay it in doing a thing in their <hi>Third</hi> Session, which might have been done in the <hi>First?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But were not these Commissioners in too great <hi>haste</hi> to come to ane <hi>Agreement</hi> when they met with the <hi>Delegates</hi> of the <hi>State</hi>? Yes, if we may believe <hi>Petrie,</hi> for he says,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:101025:192"/>
                  <note n="(f)" place="margin">Pet. 353.</note> 
                  <hi>That the same day</hi> (viz. January 16.) <hi>the Commissioners conveened and conclued,</hi> &amp;c. But he may say, with that same integrity, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he pleases. For, not to insist on <hi>Spots<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi>'s account, <note n="(g)" place="margin">Spot. 260.</note> who says, it was <hi>after diverse Meetings and long Deliberation,</hi> that they came to their Conclusion; not to insist on his authority, I say, because he may be suspected as partial; doth not <hi>Calderwood</hi> 
                  <note n="(h)" place="margin">Cal. 50.</note> expresly acknowledge, that they began their Conference upon the <hi>Sixteenth</hi> of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,</hi> and <note n="(i)" place="margin">Ib. 55.</note> that matters were not <hi>finally</hi> concluded and ended till the <hi>First</hi> of <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But was it not a <hi>corrupt</hi> Convention? Did it not allow <hi>Pont,</hi> a Minister, to be a <hi>Lord</hi> of the <hi>Session</hi>? A mighty Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, sure, of its Corruption! Well! Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it was a <hi>Corruption,</hi> was it such a <hi>plag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y one</hi> as infected all the <hi>other</hi> Acts of that Convention? Is <hi>one</hi> corrupt Act of ane Assembly enough to reprobate <hi>all</hi> the rest of its Acts? If so, I think, it will fare ill with a good many Assemblies. Whither was it a <hi>Corruption</hi> in ane <hi>Assembly</hi> to <hi>oblige</hi> men to <hi>do pennance</hi> for <hi>doing</hi> their <hi>Duty?</hi> to declare against the <hi>Kings Negative Voice</hi> in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and so to <hi>Unking</hi> him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>? But to go on, why should <hi>this</hi> Assembly bear the whole Blame of this <hi>Corruption,</hi> if it was one? was it not ratified by a subsequent Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly? And should not <hi>it</hi> bear its share? Both Authors knew this very well, for both of them record it: <note n="(k)" place="margin">Cal. 62. Pet. 379.</note> It was the Assembly
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:101025:192"/>
holden at <hi>Eden. March</hi> 6. 1573. <hi>The Regent craved some learned Men of the Ministery</hi> (they are <hi>Calderwood</hi>'s own words) <hi>to be placed Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators of the College of Iustice. The Assembly, after reasoning, at length, voted, that none was able to bear the said two Charges, and therefore inhibited any Minister to take upon him to be a Senator of the College of Iustice, Master</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Pont <hi>only excepced, who was already placed with advice and consent of the Kirk. Petrie</hi> gives the same account, only he ends it thus, <hi>By Advice,</hi> &amp;c. He thought it expedient, it seems, to conceal the mention made <hi>of the Kirk.</hi> And no doubt he did <hi>wisely, i. e.</hi> suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to his purpose; for <hi>Calderwood</hi> added it but foolishly, considering that there could not be a clearer Acknowledgement of the Authority of the <hi>Convention</hi> at <hi>Leith,</hi> than giving it thus the name of <hi>The Kirk</hi>; but what needs more? If this was a <hi>Corruption,</hi> it was <hi>one,</hi> even in the times of <hi>Presbytery,</hi> after the year 1580. For did not <hi>Pont,</hi> even then continue to be a <hi>Lord</hi> of the <hi>Session</hi>? Or will our Brethren say, that 'tis a <hi>fault</hi> to <hi>introduce</hi> a Corruption, but it is <hi>none</hi> to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue</hi> it when it is <hi>introduced</hi>? All this is said upon the supposition that it was a Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; tho I am not yet convinced that it was one, at least so great a one as might have given ground for all this stir about it. I doubt, if the Members of this Assembly at <hi>Leith,</hi> had been through paced <hi>Parity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> vigorous for the <hi>Good Cause,</hi> it should, no more have been a Corruption in them
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:101025:193"/>
to have allowed <hi>Pont</hi> to sit as a <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> than it was in the <hi>Kirk,</hi> once upon a day, to allow Mr. <hi>Alexander Henderson</hi> to sit as a Member of a <hi>Committee,</hi> you know for what. And so much for the first Plea, proceed we to the</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Force, the Court, at that time, put upon the Clergy, to accept of that Establishment. Calderwood</hi> is mighty on this <hi>Plea. The Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendent of Angus</hi> (who had a principal hand in the Agreement at <hi>Leith</hi>) <hi>a man too tractable, might easily be induced, by his Chief, the Earl of</hi> Mar, <hi>Regent, for the time, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend to the Heads and Articles of this Book.</hi> 
                  <note n="(l)" place="margin">Cal. 55.</note> And, <hi>It was easy to the Court to obtain the Consent of many Ministers to this sort of Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy — Some being poor, some being covetous and ambitious, some not taking up the gross Corruption of the Office, some having a Carnal Respect to some Noblemen their Friends.</hi> 
                  <note n="(m)" place="margin">Ib. 56.</note> And how often doth he impute it all to the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Morton</hi>? And <hi>Calderwood</hi>'s faithful Follower <hi>G.

                  <note n="(n)" place="margin">p. 7.</note> Now for answer to all this, in the first place, what if one should allow all that is alledged? will it follow from that allowance that <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy</hi> was not, then, agreed to? The Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is not how it was done? but if it was done? For if it was done it is ane argument that the Clergy, then, thought little on the <hi>indispensibility</hi> of <hi>Parity</hi>; or that they were very bad men, who, tho they believed

                  </note> This might be enough; yet I will proceed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, because what I have to say may be useful for coming by a just sense of the state of affairs in these times. I say therefore,</p>
               <p>That all this <hi>Plea</hi> is meer groundless <hi>Noise</hi> and <hi>Fiction.</hi> The <hi>Court</hi> had no imaginable reason for pressing this Establishment, which was not as proper for the Clergy to have insisted on; and the Clergy had one Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son more than the Court could pretend to.</p>
               <p>The great Reasons the <hi>Court</hi> could, <hi>then,</hi> insist on, what else could they be, than that <hi>Episcopacy</hi> stood still established by <hi>Law</hi>? That according to the fundamental Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, which had obtained time out of mind, the Ecclesiasticks had made <hi>one</hi> of
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:101025:194"/>
the <hi>Three Estates</hi> of Parliament? That such ane Essential Alteration, in the civil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, as behoved necessarily to result from the want of that <hi>Estate,</hi> being the <hi>First</hi> of the <hi>Three,</hi> was infinitely dangerous at any time, as tending to turn the whole Constitution loose, and shake the very Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the Government? That it tended to the Subversion of the High Court of Parliament, and naturally, and necessarily, inferred Essential Nullities in all the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the other <hi>two Estates</hi> could have, and all the Acts they could make? That it was more dangerous, at that time, during the Kings Minority, to have the Constitution so disjoynted, than on other occasions? That whosoever was <hi>Regent,</hi> or whosoever were his <hi>Counsellors,</hi> might be called to ane account for it, when the King came to perfect Age? And it was obvious that it might easily be found <hi>High Treason</hi> in them, that they had suffered such <hi>Alterations?</hi> That the best way to preserve the Rights of the Church, and <hi>put</hi> her, and <hi>keep</hi> her in her Possession of her Patrimony, was to <hi>preserve</hi> that <hi>Estate</hi>? That the best way to <hi>preserve</hi> that Estate, was to <hi>continue</hi> it in the old, tryed, wisely digested, and long approven Constitution of it? What other arguments, I say, than these, or such as were like them, can we conceive, the Court could then make use to perswade the Clergy to agree to the <hi>Old Polity</hi>? Is it to be imagined they turn'd <hi>Theologues,</hi> and endeavoured to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doctrinate
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:101025:194"/>
the Clergy, and convince them from Scripture, and Antiquity, and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical History, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that Episcopacy was of divine Institution, or the best, or a lawful Government of the Church? If I mistake not, such Topicks, in these times were not much thought on, by our <hi>States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi> But if they were such Arguments as I have given a <hi>Specimen</hi> of, which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted on, as no doubt they were, if they insisted on any, then I would fain know, which of them it was that might not have been as readily insisted on by the <hi>Clergy,</hi> as by the <hi>Statesmen</hi>? Nay, considering that there were no Scruples of Conscience then, concerning the <hi>Lawfulness</hi> of such a Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; how reasonable is it to think, that the <hi>Clergy</hi> might be as forward as the <hi>States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> could be, to insist on these Arguments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Especially if it be further considered, that,</p>
               <p>Besides these and the like Arguments, the Clergy had one very considerable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to move them for the Re-establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Old Constitution,</hi> which was, that they had found by Experience, that the <hi>New Scheme</hi> fallen upon in the <hi>First Book of Discipline</hi> had done much hurt to the Church, as I have already observed; that by forsaking the <hi>Old</hi> Constitution, the Church had suffered too much already; and that it was high time, for them, now, to return to their <hi>Old Fond</hi>; considering at what losses they had been since they had deserted it. And all this will appear more
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:101025:195"/>
reasonable and credible still, if two things more be duely considered. The</p>
               <p>First is, That the <hi>Six</hi> Clergymen who were commissioned by the Assembly, on this occasion, to treat with the <hi>State,</hi> were all sensible men; men who understood the Constitution both of Church and State, had <hi>Heads</hi> to <hi>comprehend</hi> the consequences of things, and were very far from being <hi>Parity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi> The</p>
               <p>Second is, The <hi>Oddness,</hi> (to call it no worse) of the Reason, which our Authors feign to have been the Motive which made the Court, at that time, so earnest for such ane Establishment; namely, that thereby, <hi>They might gripe at the Commodity.</hi> (as <hi>Calder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> 
                  <note n="(p)" place="margin">Cal. 55.</note> words it) That is, possess them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of the Churches Patrimony. What? Had the Clergy so suddenly fallen from their daily, their constant, their continual <hi>Claim</hi> to the Revenues of the Church? Had they in ane instant, altered their sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents about <hi>Sacrilege,</hi> and things conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to <hi>Holy</hi> uses? Were they now wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to part with the Churches <hi>Patrimony</hi>? Did that which moved them to be so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest for this Meeting with the State, mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously flip out of their Minds, so that they inconcernedly quate their pretensions, and betrayed their own interests? Were they all fast asleep when they were at the Conference? So much asleep, or senseless, that they could not perceive the <hi>Court</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended them such a <hi>Trick?</hi> On the other hand,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:101025:195"/>If the Court had such a design as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, I must confess, I do not see how it was useful for them to fall on such a <hi>wild</hi> project for accomplishing their purposes. Why be at all this pains to re-establish the <hi>Old</hi> Polity, if the only purpose was to <hi>rob</hi> the Church of her <hi>Patrimony</hi>? Might not that have been done without, as well as, with it? Could they have wished the Church in weaker circumstances for assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her own Rights than she was in, before this Agreement? Was it not as easy to have possest themselves of a Bishoprick, ane Abbacy, a Priory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when there were no Bishops, nor Abbots, nor Priors, as when there were? What a pitiful poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, or rather what ane insolent wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was it, as it were, to take a Coat which was no mans, and put on one, and possess him of it, and call it his Coat, that they might rob him of it? Or, making the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable supposition, that they could have ventured on such a needless, such a <hi>mad fetch</hi> of iniquity, were all the Clergy so short-sighted, that they could not penetrate into such a palpable, such a <hi>gross</hi> piece of <hi>Cheatry?</hi> But what needs more?</p>
               <p>'Tis certain that by that Agreement, the Churches Patrimony was fairly secured to her, and she was put in far better condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than she was ever in before, since the Reformation. Let any man read over <hi>Calderwoods</hi> account of the <hi>Agreement,</hi> and he must confess it: And yet perhaps the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:101025:196"/>
account may be more full and clear, in the <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Council,</hi> if they be extant.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, indeed, the <hi>Courtiers,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, played their <hi>Tricks,</hi> and <hi>robb'd</hi> the Church; and it cannot be denied, that they got some bad Clergymen, who were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ng; It was so far from these Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens minds, who adjusted matters at that time with the Laity, (these Courtiers) to give them the smallest advantages that way, to allow them the least Scope for such En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments; That, on the contrary, when, afterwards, they found the Nobility were taking such Methods, and plundering the Church; they complained mightily of it, as a manifest breach of the Agreement, and ane horrid iniquity.</p>
               <p>But whatever Truth is in all this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning, I have spent on this point, is not much material to my main purpose: For, whither, at that time, Episcopacy was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed upon the Church or not; or, if imposed, whither it was out of a bad design or not; affects not, in the least, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Controversie. For however it was, 'tis certain the Church accepted of it, at that time, which we are bound, in Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to think, a sufficient Argument that she was not then of <hi>Antiprelatical</hi> principles; She had no such Article in her <hi>Creed,</hi> as the <hi>Divine Right of Parity</hi>; which is the great
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:101025:196"/>
point I am concerned for in all this tedious Controversie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Third Plea,</hi> is, The <hi>Limitedness of the Power which was, then, granted to Bishops.</hi> They had no more Power granted them by this Establishment, than Superintendents had enjoyed before. This all my Authors insist upon with great Earnestness. <note n="(q)" place="margin">Cal. 51, 55, 56, 66. Pet. 374, 383. G.

Tho they had no more <hi>power,</hi> yet it is certain they had more <hi>Privilege:</hi> They were not answerable to their own <hi>Synods,</hi> but only to <hi>General Assemblies,</hi> as is clear, even from <hi>Calderwoods</hi> own account of the agreement at <hi>Leith.</hi> 
                  <note n="(r)" place="margin">Cal. 51.</note> In that point, the absurd Constitution in the <hi>First Book of Discipline</hi> was altered. 3. One thing more I cannot but observe, here, concerning Mr. <hi>Carlderwood.</hi> This judicious Historian, when he was concerned to <hi>raise Dust</hi> about the <hi>Prelacy</hi> of <hi>Superintendents,</hi> found easily 7 or 8 <hi>huge</hi> Differences between <hi>Superintendents</hi> and <hi>Bishops.</hi> And now, that he is concern'd to <hi>raise Dust</hi> about the <hi>Prelacy</hi> of Bishops, he thinks he has gain'd a great point if he makes it the same with the <hi>Prelacy</hi> of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendents.

               </p>
               <p>These and many more such things are boldly and confidently asserted by <hi>Calder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, Petrie,</hi> and the <hi>strenuous Vindicator</hi> of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who seldom misses of saying what <hi>Calderwood</hi> had said before him; and I shall grant they are all said to purpose, if they are true: But how far they are from being that may sufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, I hope, if I can make these things evident.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Agreement at <hi>Leith</hi> was fairly and frequently allowed, approven, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted on, by many subsequent Assemblies.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That after Episcopacy was questioned, and a Party appeared against it, it cost them much strugling, and much time, before they could get it abolished.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I say, The <hi>Agreement</hi> at <hi>Leith</hi> was fairly and frequently allowed, approven, and insisted on, by many subsequent Assemblies. This Assertion cannot but appear true to any unbyassed Judgment, that shall consider but these two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That, in <hi>Every Assembly,</hi> for several years, after that Establishment, or <hi>Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or Settlement at <hi>Leith,</hi> Bishops were
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:101025:198"/>

               <p n="2">2. That these two Authors have been at special pains, to let the world know, how punctually they were tryed, and sometimes rebuked and censured for not discharging their Offices, as they ought to have done. Both Authors, I say, have been very intent and careful to represent this in their accounts of the subsequent Assemblies. I know their purpose, herein, was to expose the Bishops, and cast all the <hi>Dirt,</hi> they could, upon <hi>Episcopacy.</hi> But then, as I take it, their pains, that way, have <hi>luckily</hi> furnished me with a plain Demonstration of the false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of all they have said, in this <hi>Plea,</hi> I am now considering: For</p>
               <p>Would these Assemblies have suffered them to be <hi>present,</hi> and <hi>sit,</hi> and <hi>vote</hi> as <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>? Would they have <hi>tryed</hi> and <hi>censured</hi> them as <hi>Bishops</hi>? Would they have put them to their <hi>Duty</hi> as <hi>Bishops,</hi> if they had not <hi>own'd</hi> them for Bishops? And was there any other <hi>Fond</hi> for owning them for Bishops, at that time, except the <hi>Agreement</hi> at <hi>Leith?</hi> This alone might be sufficient, I say, for dispatching this whole <hi>Plea.</hi> Yet</p>

the same day, they met and concluded?) <hi>and have concluded for that time, upon the Heads and Articles as the same produced, in this Assembly, proport: In which, being considered, are found certain Names, as</hi> Archbishop, Dean, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon, Chancellor, Chapter, <hi>which Names are thought slanderous and offensive in the Ears of many of the Brethren, appearing to</hi> found <hi>towards Papistry; Therefore, the whole Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in one voice, as well they who were in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission at</hi> Leith, <hi>as others, solemnly protest, that they mean not, by using such Names, to ratify, consent, or agree to any</hi> kind <hi>of</hi> Papistrie <hi>or</hi> Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition; <hi>wishing rather the said</hi> Names <hi>to be changed into other</hi> Names, <hi>that are not</hi> scandalous <hi>and</hi> offensive; <hi>and, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, they</hi> protest, <hi>That the said Heads and Articles agreed upon, be only received as ane</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim, <hi>until farther, and more perfect Order be obtained, at the hands of the Kings Majesties Regent and Nobility: For the which, they will press, as occasion shall serve. Vnto the which</hi> Protestation <hi>the whole Assembly, in one voice, adhere.</hi> So the <hi>Mss. Spot. Cald. Pet.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This is the Act, on which, <hi>Calderwood, Petrie,</hi> and <hi>G. R.</hi> found their assertion, That Episcopacy, <hi>as agreed to at Leith</hi> was <hi>protested</hi> against, and earnestly opposed, by a General Assembly; but with what Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Reason, let any Man consider: For, what can be more plain, than, that they <hi>receive</hi> the substance of the Articles, and only <hi>protest</hi> against the Scandalousness of the Names used in them? What reason they
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:101025:199"/>
had for that, besides the over-zealous Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple I mentioned before, let the curious enquire: That's none of my present business.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>They protest that they receive these Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles only for ane</hi> Interim: True; But how doth it appear that they received them only for ane <hi>Interim, out of a</hi> Dislike <hi>to</hi> Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy? <hi>Had they believed the Divine Right of Parity,</hi> how could they have received them so much as, for ane <hi>Interim?</hi> How could they have received them <hi>at all</hi>? The Truth is, there were many things in the <hi>Articles</hi> which requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red amendment, even tho the Gen. Ass. had believed the <hi>Divine Right</hi> of <hi>Episcopacy.</hi> And that they did not <hi>receive</hi> them, for ane <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim,</hi> upon the account of any <hi>Dislike</hi> they had to <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> shall be made evident, by and by. In the mean time, we have gained one point, even, <hi>That they were received by this Assembly</hi>; unless <hi>receiving</hi> for an <hi>Interim</hi> be not <hi>receiving</hi>: But if they were <hi>received,</hi> I hope it is not <hi>true,</hi> that <hi>they were never allowed by a General Assembly.</hi> And if <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy</hi> was not <hi>protested</hi> against <hi>at all,</hi> and if there was no such <hi>word</hi> or <hi>phrase</hi> in the Act, as had the least Tendency to import that they judged it a <hi>Corruption,</hi> I hope, it may consist well enough with the Laws of Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, to say that <hi>G. R.</hi> was talking <hi>without Book,</hi> when he said, <hi>It was protested against as a Corruption,</hi> by this General Assembly. I doubt, if he had found any of the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latists</hi> talking with so <hi>much</hi> Confidence, where they had so <hi>little</hi> ground, he would
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:101025:200"/>
have been at his beloved <hi>Lies and Calumnies.</hi> But enough of this, proceed we in our <hi>Series.</hi>

                  <hi>Petrie</hi> has the substance of most of these Acts, but has been at pains to <hi>obscure</hi> them. And no wonder; for here are so many <hi>Branches</hi> of <hi>true Episcopal power,</hi> esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in the persons of these Bishops, that it could not but have appeared very strange, that a General Assembly should have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred them on them, if there was such ane aversion then, to the <hi>Order,</hi> as he and his Fellows are willing to have the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, there was. But</p>
               <p>Honest <hi>Calderwood</hi> was wiser, for he hath not so much as ane intimation of any <hi>one</hi> of them. And <hi>Calderwood</hi> having thus concealed them, nay, generally, all alongst, whatever might make against his Cause, as much as he could; what wonder if <hi>G. R.</hi> who knows nothing in the matter, but what <hi>Calderwood</hi> told him, stumbled upon such a notable piece of Ignorance, in his first Vindication, as to tell the world, That <hi>Nothing was restored at</hi> Leith <hi>but the Image of Prelacy? That these Tulchan Bishops had only the Name of Bishops, while Noblemen and others had the Revenue, and the Church all the power?</hi> Nay, <hi>That,</hi> notwithstanding of all, was done at <hi>Leith, The real Exercise of Presbytery, in
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:101025:201"/>
all its Meetings lesser and greater, continued and was allowed</hi>? But of this more hereafter.</p>
               <p>The Assembly, holden at <hi>Eden. March</hi> 6. 1574. <hi>Concluded concerning the Iurisdiction of Bishops, in their Ecclesiastical Function, that it should not exceed the Iurisdiction of Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, which, heretofore, they have had, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently have: And that they should be subject to the Discipline of the General Ass. as Members thereof, as Superintendents had been heretofore, in all sorts.</hi> And again, This Assembly <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains, That no Bishop give Collation of any Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice within the bounds of Superintendents within his Diocess, without their Consent and Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nials, subscribed with their hands: And that Bishops, within their Diocesses visit by themselves, where no Superintendent is; and give no Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Benefices without the Consent of three well qualified Ministers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here indeed both <hi>Calderwood</hi> and <hi>Petrie</hi> 
                  <note n="(q)" place="margin">Cald. 66.

But, as I take it, there was no very great reason for this <hi>Triumph,</hi> if the true reason of these Acts be considered, as it may be collected from <hi>Spotswood</hi> and <hi>Petrie</hi> 
                  <note n="(r)" place="margin">Spot. 272. Pet. 383.</note> which was this,</p>

                     </gap>on,</hi> then <hi>Regent,</hi> and sordidly covetous, had flattered the Church out of their Possession of the <hi>Thirds</hi> of the Benefices; the only sure <hi>Stock,</hi> they could as yet <hi>claim,</hi> by any Law, made since the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:101025:202"/>
Reformation of Religion; promising, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead thereof, to settle <hi>local'd Stipends</hi> upon the Ministers; but having once obtain'd his end, which was to have the <hi>Thirds</hi> at his Disposal, he forgot his promise; and the Ministers found themselves miserably <hi>trickt.</hi> Three or four Churches were cast together, and committed to the Care of one Minister; and a Farthing, to live by, could not be got, without vast attendance, trouble and importunity. Besides, the Superintendents, who had had a principal hand in the Reformation, and were Men of great Repute, and had spent liberally of their own Estates in the Service of the Church, were as ill treated as any body: For when they sought their wonted allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, they were told, there was no more use for them; Bishops were now restored; it was <hi>their</hi> Province to govern the Church: Superintendents were now superfluous and unnecessary. The Superintendents thus Mal treated, what wonder was it if they had their own Resentments of it? So, when, the General Assembly met, <hi>Areskin, Spotswood</hi> and <hi>Winram,</hi> three of them (and, by that time, 'tis probable, there were no more of them alive) came to the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, offered to dimit their Offices, and were earnest that the Kirk would accept of their Dimission: They were now turn'd useless Members of the Ecclesiastical body; their Office was evacuated; they could serve no longer. The whole Assembly
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:101025:202"/>
could not but know the matter; and as they knew for what reasons these ancient and venerable persons were so much irritated, so their own concern, in the same common interest, could not but prompt them to a fellow-feeling; they knew not how soon the next <hi>Mortonian Experiment</hi> might be tryed upon themselves; they, therefore, unanimously, refuse to accept of the Dimis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and whither the <hi>Superintendents</hi> will or not, they continue them in their Offices; and not only so, but they thought it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to renew that <hi>Article</hi> of the <hi>Agreement</hi> at <hi>Leith,</hi> viz.
<q>
                     <hi>That Bishops and Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> stood on the same Level, had the same Power, the same Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction; and were to be regulated by the same Canons:</q>
Importing thereby, that both were useful in the Church at such a juncture; and that the Church had not received Bishops to the <hi>Exauctoration</hi> of the few surviving Superintendents; and now, in their old age, rendring them contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And who could condemn the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly for taking a course that was both so natural and so obvious? Nay, it was even the <hi>Bishops interest,</hi> as much as any other <hi>Assembly-mens</hi> to agree to this conclusion; For the great business in hand, was not about <hi>Extent</hi> of <hi>Power,</hi> or <hi>Point</hi> of <hi>Dignity</hi>; had no Incentive to <hi>Iealousie</hi> or <hi>Emulation</hi> in it; but it was about the <hi>Revenues</hi> of the <hi>Church:</hi> To secure these against the insa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable Avarice of a <hi>Griping</hi> Lord <hi>Regent.</hi> A
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:101025:203"/>
point the Bishops were as nearly concerned in as any Men: For if these three Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendents, who had so long born the heat of the day, and done such eminent and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary services to the Church, should be once sacrificed to <hi>Mortons</hi> Covetousness, how easy might it be for him to make what farther Encroachments he pleased? How easy, to carry on his project against other men, who perhaps, had no such Merit, no such Repute, no such Interest in the Affections of the People? This, I say, was the Reason for which these two Acts were made in this Assembly; and not that the Assembly were turning <hi>weary</hi> of Bishops, or were become, any way, disaffected to them. So that <hi>Calderwood</hi> and <hi>Petrie</hi> had but little reason to be so <hi>boastful</hi> for these <hi>two Acts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That it was not out of any <hi>Dislike</hi> to Episcopacy, that these <hi>two Acts</hi> were made, is clear, as Light, from the next Assembly, which met in <hi>August</hi> 1574. For therein the Clergy manifestly continuing of the same Principles, and proceeding on the same Reasons, order a <hi>Petition</hi> consisting of <hi>Nine Articles,</hi> to be drawn, and presented to the Regent. <hi>Calderwood,</hi> indeed, doth not mention this <hi>Petition.</hi> But it is in the <hi>Mss.</hi> and <hi>Petrie</hi> 
                  <note n="(s)" place="margin">Pet. 384.</note> talks of it, but disinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously; for he mentions it only <hi>Overly,</hi> telling, That <hi>some Articles were sent unto the Lord Regent</hi>; and he sets down but <hi>two,</hi> whereas, as I said, there are <hi>Nine</hi> in the <hi>Mss.</hi>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:101025:203"/>
and most of them looking the Regents <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious</hi> inclinations even <hi>Staringly</hi> in the <hi>Face.</hi> I shall only Transcribe such of them as cannot, when perpended, but be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to have tended that way. They are these:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That Stipends be granted to Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, in all time coming, in all Countreys desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute thereof; whither it be where there is no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, or where there are Bishops, who cannot discharge their Office, as the Bishops of</hi> St. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews <hi>and</hi> Glasgow; who had too large Diocesses. This Article <hi>Petrie</hi> hath but <hi>Minc'd:</hi> Indeed it is a very considerable one; For here you see, 1. That, in contradiction to the Regents purposes, the Assembly <hi>owns</hi> and <hi>stands by</hi> the <hi>Superintendents</hi>: They are so far from being satisfied to part with the <hi>Three,</hi> they had; that, on the contrary, they crave to have more, and to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions for them; and that, in all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, where Bishops either <hi>are not</hi>; or <hi>are,</hi> but have too <hi>large Diocesses.</hi> 2. They crave these things <hi>For all times coming</hi>; a Clause of such importance to the main Question, that <hi>Petrie</hi> has, <hi>unfaithfully,</hi> left it out: And truly, I must confess, if it were lawful for Men to be <hi>Vnfaithful,</hi> when it might serve that which they conceived to be a <hi>Good End,</hi> he had great Reason, to try it, in this instance: For this <hi>Clause,</hi> when (not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, but) brought above board, gives a fatal Overthrow, to all these <hi>popular Plea's</hi> of Episcopacy's being then obtruded on
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:101025:204"/>
the Church; forced upon her against her Will; tolerated only for a time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For, from this <hi>Clause,</hi> it is as <hi>clear,</hi> as a <hi>Clause</hi> can make it, that this Assembly entertain'd no such imaginations. They supposed Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy was to continue <hi>for all time coming,</hi> For, <hi>for all time Coming,</hi> they petition that provision may be made for Superintendents, <hi>where no Bishops are, or where their Diocesses are too large for them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Second Article is, <hi>That in all Burghs, where the Ministers are displaced, and serve at other Kirks, these Ministers be restored to wait on their Cures, and be not obliged to serve at other Churches,</hi> &amp;c. Directly striking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Regents <hi>politick</hi> of <hi>Uniting three</hi> or <hi>four</hi> Churches under the <hi>Care</hi> of <hi>one</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister. The</p>
               <p n="4">4. (Which <hi>Petrie</hi> also hath) is, <hi>That in all Churches destitute of Ministers, such persons may be planted as the Bishops, Superintendents and Commissioners shall name; and that Stipends be assigned to them.</hi> Ane Article, visibly, levell'd as the former.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>That Doctors may be placed in Vniversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and Stipends granted them; whereby, not only they who are presently placed may have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to be diligent in their Cure; but other learned Men may have Occasion to seek places in Colleges.</hi> Still to the same purposes, <hi>viz.</hi> the finding reasonable Uses for the Patrimony of the Church.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>That his Grace would take a General Order with the poor, especially in the Abbeys, such as

               </p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>That his Grace would cause the Books of the Assignation of the Kirk, be delivered to the Clerk of the General Assembly.</hi> These Books of Assignation, as they call them, were the Books, wherein the Names of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and their several proportions of the <hi>Thirds</hi> were Recorded: It seems they were earnest to be repossessed of their <hi>Thirds,</hi> seeing the Regent had not kept promise to them. But</p>
               <p>The Eighth Article, which, (by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable inversion, I hope) I have reserved to the last place, is, of all, the most consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable. It is, <hi>That his Grace would provide Qualified persons for Vacant Bishopricks.</hi> Let the candid Reader judge, now, if <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,</hi> by the <hi>Leith-Articles</hi> was <hi>forced</hi> upon the <hi>Church</hi> against <hi>her Inclinations?</hi> If it was never approven (when Bishops were thus petitioned for) by a General Assembly? If it be likely that the Assembly in <hi>August</hi> 1572. protested against it as a Corruption? If the Acts of the last Assembly, declaring Bishops to have no more power than Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendents had, and making them account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the General Assembly, proceeded from any <hi>Dislike</hi> of Episcopacy? If this Assembly, petitioning thus for Bishops, believed the <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>indispensible institution of Parity</hi>? If both <hi>Calderwood</hi> and <hi>Petrie</hi> acted

               <p>By this time, I think, I have not intirely disappointed my Reader: I think, I have made it competently appear, That the <hi>Agreement</hi> at <hi>Leith</hi> was fairly and frequently allowed, approven, and insisted on, by not a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But, I think, I have already made good my Undertaking, and therefore I shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist no further on this point: Only <hi>One</hi> thing I must add further; It is this.</p>
               <p>After the most impartial, narrow, and attentive Search, I could make, I have not found, all this while, <hi>viz.</hi> from the first publick Establishment of the Reformed Religion in <hi>Scotland, Anno</hi> 1560. so much as <hi>One Indication</hi> of either publick or private <hi>Dislike</hi> to <hi>Prelacy</hi>; But that it, constantly, and uninterruptedly, prevailed, and all persons, chearfully as well as quietly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to it, till the year 1575. when it was first called in Question. And here I might fairly shut up this long, and perhaps nauseous Discourse, upon the Second En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry which I proposed: For, whatever Men our Reformers were, whatever their other principles might be; I think I have made it plain, that they were <hi>not</hi> for the <hi>Divine Right of Parity,</hi> or the <hi>Vnlawfulness
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:101025:205"/>
of the Superiority of any Office in the Church, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Presbyters:</hi> No such principle was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed, or insisted on, or offered to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to practice, by them, <hi>Before, At,</hi> or full fifteen years <hi>After</hi> the publick Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Reformation: And if this <hi>may not</hi> pass for sufficient proof of the truth of my <hi>Resolution</hi> of the <hi>Enquiry,</hi> I know not what <hi>may.</hi> However, because</p>
               <p>THE SECOND thing I promised to shew, tho not precisely necessary to my main design, may yet be so far useful, as to bring considerably more of <hi>Light</hi> to it; and withal, give the world a prospect of the <hi>Rise</hi> and <hi>Progress</hi> of <hi>Presbytery</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> I shall endeavour to make good my Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking; which was, that, after <hi>Episcopacy</hi> was question'd, it was not <hi>easily</hi> overturn'd; Its Adversaries met with much Resistance, and Opposition, in their Endeavors to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert it. I shall study brevity as much as the weight of the matter will allow me. In short then; take it thus.</p>
               <p>Master <hi>Andrew Melvil,</hi> after some years spent at <hi>Geneva,</hi> returned to <hi>Scotland</hi> in <hi>Iuly</hi> 1574. He had lived<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in that City, under the influences of <hi>Theodore Beza,</hi> the <hi>true parent</hi> of <hi>Presbytery.</hi> He was a Man, by Nature, fierce and fiery, confident and peremptory, peevish and ungovernable: Education, in him, had not sweetned Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but Nature had sowred Education; and both conspiring together, had trickt him up into a true Original; a piece com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:101025:206"/>
of pride and petulance, of jeer and jangle, of Satyr and Sarcasm; of venome and vehemence: He hated the <hi>Crown</hi> as much as the <hi>Mitre,</hi> the <hi>Scepter</hi> as much as the <hi>Crosier,</hi> and could have made as bold with the <hi>Purple</hi> 
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">Cald. 329.</note> as with the <hi>Rochet:</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This Man thus accoutred, was scarcely warm at home, when he began to dissemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate his sentiments, insinuate them into others, and make a <hi>party</hi> against <hi>Prelacy,</hi> and for the <hi>Genevian Model.</hi> For this I need not depend on <hi>Spotswoods</hi> Authority, tho he asserts it plainly: <note n="(c)" place="margin">Spot. 275.</note> I have a more <hi>Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> Author for it, if more Authentick can be: I have <hi>Melvil</hi> himself for it, in a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Beza</hi> dated <hi>Novem.</hi> 13. 1579. (to be found both in <hi>Petrie</hi> 
                  <note n="(d)" place="margin">Pet. 401.</note> and in the Pamphlet called <hi>Vindiciae Philadelphi,</hi> from which <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie</hi> had it) of which Letter, the very first words are, <hi>we have not ceased these five years to fight against Pseudepiscopacy, &amp;c.</hi> Now rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon <hi>five years</hi> backward, from <hi>Novem.</hi> 1579. and you stand at <hi>November</hi> 1574. whereby we find that within three or four Months, after his arrival, the <hi>Plot</hi> was begun, tho' it was near to a year thereafter, before it came above-board.</p>
               <p>Having thus <hi>projected</hi> his work, and form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his <hi>party,</hi> the next care was to get one to <hi>Table</hi> it fairly: He himself was but late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:101025:206"/>
come home; he was much a Stranger in the Country, having been ten years abroad: He had been but at very few General Assemblies, if at any; his influence was but <hi>green</hi> and <hi>budding</hi>; his Authority but <hi>young</hi> and <hi>tender:</hi> It was not fit for him, amongst his First Appearances, to propose so great ane Innovation. And, it seems, the <hi>Thinking Men</hi> of his Party, however resolutely they might promise to <hi>back</hi> the Motion, when, once, fairly <hi>Tabled,</hi> were yet a little <hi>shy</hi> to be the <hi>first</hi> Proposers: So, it fell to the share of <hi>one,</hi> who, at that time, was none of the greatest <hi>Statesmen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iohn Durie,</hi> one of the Ministers of <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> was the person; as <hi>Spotswood</hi> describes him, <note n="(e)" place="margin">Spot. 457.</note> 
                  <hi>A sound hearted Man, far from all Dissimulation, open, professing what he thought, earnest and zealous in his Cause, whatever it was; but too too credulous, and easily to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed on.</hi> However, (that I may do him as much justice, as <hi>Spotswood</hi> has done him before me.) A Man he was, who thought no Shame to acknowledge his Error, when he was convinced of it. For so it was, that, when, after many years Experience, he had satisfied himself, that <hi>Parity</hi> had truly proved the <hi>Parent</hi> of <hi>Confusion,</hi> and disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed all his Expectations; and when, through Age and Sickness, he was not able, in person, to attend the General Assembly, <hi>Anno</hi> 1600. he gave Commission to some Brethren to tell them, as from him, <hi>That there was a Necessity of restoring the Ancient
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:101025:207"/>
Government of the Church,</hi> &amp;c. Such was the Man, I say, to whose share it fell to be the <hi>first,</hi> who, publickly, questioned the <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi> of <hi>Prelacy</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi>; which was not done till the <hi>Sixth</hi> day of <hi>August</hi> 1575. as I said before, no less than full fifteen years after the first legal Establishment of our <hi>Scottish</hi> Reformation. And so I come to my purpose.</p>
               <p>On this <hi>Sixth</hi> of <hi>August</hi> 1575. the <hi>Gen. Ass.</hi> met at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> according to the Order, then, observed in General Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies; the <hi>First</hi> thing done, after the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly was constituted, was, the Tryal of the Doctrine, Diligence, Lives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the Bishops and other constant Members: So, while this was a doing, <hi>Iohn Durie</hi> stood up and protested, <hi>That the Tryal of the Bishops might not prejudge the Opinions and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, which he and other Brethren of his Mind, had, to propose against the Office and Name of a Bishop.</hi> 
                  <note n="(f)" place="margin">Mss. Pet. 385. Spot. 275. Cald. 68.</note> Thus was the <hi>fatal</hi> Controversie set on <hi>foot,</hi> which, since, hath brought such Miseries and Calamities on the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Hare</hi> thus <hi>started, Melvil,</hi> the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal <hi>Huntsman,</hi> strait pursued her: He presently began a long, and, no doubt, premeditated Harangue; commended <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi>'s Zeal, enlarged upon the flourishing State of the Church of <hi>Geneva,</hi> insisted on the Sentiments of <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Church Government</hi>; and, at last affirmed, <hi>That none ought to be Office-bearers in the Church,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:101025:207"/>
whose Titles were not found in the Book of God: That the the Title of Bishops was found in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, yet, it was not to be understood in the Sense, then, current: That Iesus Christ, the only Lord of his Church, allowed no Superiority amongst the Ministers, but had instituted them all, in the same Degree, and had endued them with equal power:</hi> Concluding, <hi>That the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, which had crept into the Estate of Bishops were so great, as, unless the same were removed, it could not go well with the Church, nor could Religion be long preserved in Purity.</hi> 
                  <note n="(g)" place="margin">Spot. 275. Pet. 387.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Controversie thus plainly stated, <hi>Mr. David Lindesay, Master George Hay,</hi> and <hi>Master Iohn Row, three</hi> Episcopalians, were appointed to confer and reason upon the Question proponed with <hi>Mr. Andrew Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, Mr. Iames Lawson,</hi> and <hi>Mr. Iohn Craig; two</hi> Presbyterians, and <hi>one,</hi> much indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent for both sides. <hi>After diverse Meetings, and long Disceptation</hi> saith <hi>Spotswood,</hi>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>They think it not expedient, presently, to answer, directly, to the First Question. But if any Bishop shall be chosen, who hath not such Qualities as the word of God requires, let him be tryed by the General Assembly</hi> De Novo, <hi>and so deposed.</hi>

               <p>'Tis true, here are some things, which, perhaps, when thoroughly examined, will not be found so exactly agreeable to the Sentiments and Practice of the Primitive Church. However, 'tis evident, for this <hi>Bout,</hi> the <hi>Imparity-men</hi> carried the day; and it seems the <hi>Parity-men</hi> have not yet been so well fixed for the <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>indispensible Right</hi> of it, as our <hi>Modern Parity-men</hi> would think needful; otherwise, how came they to consent to such Conclusions? How came they to yield that it was not expedient, at that time, to answer directly to the first Question, which was concerning the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of Episcopacy? Were they of the Modern Principles, <hi>G. R</hi>'s Principles? Did they think that <hi>Divine institutions</hi> might be <hi>dispensed</hi> with, <hi>crossed,</hi> according to the <hi>Exigencies</hi> of <hi>Expediency</hi> or <hi>Inexpediency?</hi> What ane Honour is it to the <hi>Party</hi> if their first <hi>Hero's</hi> were such <hi>Casuists</hi>?

in the <hi>Third Conclusion</hi>? Indeed both <hi>Calderwood</hi> and <hi>Petrie</hi> acknowledge so much.</p>

                  <note n="(l)" place="margin">Cal. 69.</note> saith, <hi>It seemeth that by Reason of the Regents Authority, who was bent upon the Course</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> Episcopacy) <hi>whereof he was the chief Instrument, that they answered not directly, at this time, to the Question.</hi> Here, you see, he owns that nothing, at this time was concluded against the <hi>Course,</hi> as he calls it; whither he had reason, to say, <hi>It seemed</hi> to be upon such ane account, shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered afterward.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Petrie</hi> 
                  <note n="(m)" place="margin">Pet. 387.</note> acknowledges it too; but in such a <hi>passion,</hi> it seems, as quite mastered his <hi>Prudence,</hi> when he did it; for these are his words. <hi>Howbeit in these Conclusions they express not the Negative, because they would not plainly oppose the particular interest of the Council, seeking security of the Possessions, by the Title of Bishops; yet these Affirmatives take away the pretended Office.</hi> Now let the world consider the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of this Author in advancing this <hi>fine period.</hi> They did not express the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, (they did not condemn Episcopacy) because they would not plainly oppose the particular interest of the Council, seeking Security of the Possessions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now let us enquire who were these, <hi>They,</hi> who would not, for this reason condemn Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, at that time? It must either belong to the <hi>Six Collocutors</hi> who drew the Concusions, or to the <hi>whole Assembly</hi>: If to the <hi>Collocutors,</hi> 'tis plain, <hi>Three</hi> of them, <hi>viz. Row, Hay,</hi> and <hi>Lindesay</hi>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:101025:209"/>
were innocent; they were perswaded in their Minds of the <hi>Expediency</hi> (to say no further) as well as the <hi>Lawfulness</hi> of Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, and I think that was reason enough for them not to <hi>condemn</hi> it. The <hi>Presbyterian Brethren,</hi> then, if any, were the persons who were moved not to condemn it, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they would not plainly oppose the particular interest of the Council,</hi> &amp;c. But if so, hath not Master <hi>Petrie</hi> made them very <hi>brave fellows</hi>? Hath he not fairly made them such friends to <hi>Sacrilege,</hi> that they would rather <hi>baulk</hi> a <hi>divine Institution,</hi> than interrupt its <hi>Course,</hi> and offend its <hi>Votaries</hi>? If by the word, <hi>They,</hi> he meant the General Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; if the whole Assembly were <hi>they,</hi> who would not express the <hi>Negative, because they would not oppose,</hi> &amp;c. I think, Mr. <hi>Petrie,</hi> were he alive, would have enough to do, to prove that that was the Reason they were determin'd by. What? Had the whole Church quate all their pretensions, they insisted on so much, on every Occasion? Had they now given over their <hi>Claim</hi> to the <hi>Revenues</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>? Shall I declare my poor opinion in this matter? I am apt to believe that it was one of the great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments insisted on by the Three Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian Collocutors, at that time,
<q>That if Episcopacy should be concluded unlawful, and, by consequence, overturned, the Patrimony of the Church would undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly go to wreck; The hungry Courtiers would presently possess themselves of the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:101025:209"/>
Revenues belonging to the Bishops:</q>
               </p>
               <p>Sure I am, as things then stood, there was all the Reason in the world for insist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on this Argument: But to pass this. <hi>Petrie</hi> it seems was not content with giving the <hi>quite contrary</hi> of that, which in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, was the true Reason, at least one of the true Reasons, for not overturning Episcopary at that time; But he behoved to add something more Extravagant: He behoved to add <hi>That the Affirmatives</hi> in the aforesaid conclusions <hi>took away the pretended Office</hi> of Episcopacy. What might he not have said, after this? It seems, that in this Authors opinion, all is one thing, to assert the Lawfulness of ane Office, and thereupon to <hi>continue it,</hi> and to <hi>take it away.</hi> But perhaps I may be blamed for taking so much notice of ane angry mans Excesses, For no doubt it was anger that such conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions should have been made, that hurtied him upon such Extravagances; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I shall leave him, and return to my threed.</p>
               <p>By what I have told, it may be easy to judge, how cold the first Entertainment was, which Parity got when it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to the General Assembly: and so much the more, if it be further considered that, by this same Assembly, some 8 or 9 Articles were ordered to be presented to <hi>My Lord Regents Grace,</hi> whereof the <hi>First</hi> (as I find it in the <hi>MS.</hi> and in <hi>Petrie</hi> himself <note n="(n)" place="margin">Pet. 385.</note> tho' neither so fully nor so fairly) was this.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:101025:210"/>
                  <hi>Imprimis, for planting and preaching the word, thro' the whole Realm, It is Desired, that so many Ministers as may be had, who are yet unplaced, may be received, as well in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, to relieve the charge of them who have many Kirks, as otherwise, throughout the whole Realm, with Superintendents or Commissioners within these Bonnds where Bishops are not, and to help such Bishops as have too great Charges: And that Livings be appointed to the aforesaid Persons: and also payment to them who have travelled before, as Commissioners, in the years of God</hi> 1573. <hi>and</hi> 1574. <hi>and so forth, in time coming, without which, the travels of such Men will cease.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This I say is the First of many Articles ordered by this Assembly for the Regent; From which it is Evident, not only, that Mr. <hi>Melvils</hi> Project made little, or no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress, at this time, but also that the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly continued firm and stedfast in the same very intentions, and of the same very Principles, which had prevailed in former Assemblies, <hi>viz.</hi> to stop the uniting of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; to multiply the number of persons cloathed with <hi>Prelatick</hi> power; To continue that <hi>power</hi> in the Church; and by all means to secure her Patrimony and guard against, and Exclude all alienations of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Melvil</hi> and his <hi>Partisans,</hi> thus successless in their first attempt, but withal, once engaged and resolved not to give over, began, it seems, against the next Assembly to reflect on what they had done, and perceive that they had mistaken their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures:
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:101025:210"/>
And indeed it was a little precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantly done, at the very first, to state the Question simply and absolutely upon the <hi>Lawfulness</hi> or <hi>Vnlawfulness</hi> of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> in the General, as they had stated it. It was a new Question which had never been sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> before: And it could not but be <hi>surprizing</hi> to the greatest part of the Assembly. Thus to call in Question the <hi>Lawfulness</hi> of ane <hi>Office</hi> which had been so <hi>early,</hi> so <hi>universally,</hi> so <hi>usefully,</hi> so <hi>incontestedly,</hi> received by the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> This was a point of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: For, to Declare that Office <hi>Vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> what was it else than to condemn all these Churches, in the primitive times, which had own'd it and flourish't under it? What else than to condemn the <hi>Scottish Reformation</hi> and <hi>Reformers,</hi> who had never Question'd it, but, on the contrary, had proceeded all, alongst, on principles which, clearly supposed its <hi>Lawfulness,</hi> if not its <hi>Necessity?</hi> Nay, was it not to condemn, particularly, all these General Assemblies which, immediately before, had so much Authorized and confirm'd it? Besides, as hath been already observed, to Declare Episcopacy <hi>Vnlawful</hi> was, unavoidably, to stifle all these projects, they had been so industriously forming for recovering the Churches Patrimony: And not only so, but to expose it more and more to be devoured by the voracious Laity. It was Plain, it could no sooner be declared <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,</hi>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:101025:211"/>
than it behoved to be parted with; and <hi>turn out the Bishops, once, and what would become of the Bishopricks</hi>? Nay, to turn them out, what was it else, than, to undo the whole <hi>Agreement</hi> at <hi>Leith,</hi> which was the greatest security, the Church, then, had for her Patrimony? For these and the like reasons, I say, laying aside the <hi>impiety,</hi> and insisting only on the <hi>imprudence</hi> of the <hi>Melvilian Project,</hi> it was, no doubt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitantly done, at the very first, to make that the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Question:</hi> And it was no wonder if the <hi>Assembly</hi> was unanimous in agreeing to the conclusions which had been laid before them by the <hi>six Collocutors:</hi> Nay, it was no wonder if <hi>Melvil</hi> and his Party, sensible of their errour, and willing to cover it, the best way they could, yielded, for that time, to the other <hi>Three,</hi> who had, so visibly, the advantage of them, at least, in the point of the Churches <hi>interest:</hi> And therefore,</p>
               <p>At the next Assembly, which was holden at <hi>Edenburgh, April</hi> 24. 1576. they altered the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Question,</hi> as <hi>Spotswood</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves, <note n="(o)" place="margin">Spot. 276.</note> and made it this, <hi>Whether Bishops, as they were then in Scotland, had their Function warranted by the word of God?</hi> But even thus stated, at that time, it avail'd them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: For, (as it is in the <hi>MS.</hi>) <hi>The whole Assembly, for the most part, after Reasoning and long Disputation upon every Article of the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns</hi> (viz. the six Collocutors) <hi>opinion and advice, resolutely approved and affirmed the same,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:101025:211"/>
and every Article thereof, as the same was given in by them.</hi> And then the Articles are Repeated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Calderwood</hi> and <hi>Petrie</hi> do both shuffle over the state of the Question, <note n="(p)" place="margin">Cald. 72.

               <list>
                  <item>1. That whatever the <hi>Melvilian Party</hi> might then be, They were but the <hi>smaller</hi> Party: <hi>The whole Assembly for the most part,</hi> that is, as I take it, the far greater part of the Assembly was against them.</item>
                  <item>2. That <hi>the whole Assembly for the most part</hi> seem to have been seriously perswaded they were in the right, and did not <hi>approve and affirm</hi> these Articles either <hi>indeliberately</hi> or <hi>faintly</hi>; For it was after <hi>Reasoning and long Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,</hi> that they <hi>approved</hi> and <hi>affirmed</hi> them, and they were sufficiently <hi>Keen</hi> in the matter, for they did it <hi>Resolutely.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. The <hi>Melvilian Party</hi> were <hi>over-voted,</hi> even as the <hi>Question</hi> was, then, <hi>Stated: The whole Assembly for the most part,</hi> stood for Episcopacy as it was then established in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and would not declare it Unlawful. From all which, I leave to the world to judge, if <hi>Presbyterian parity</hi> did not meet with opposition, with very great opposition, at its first appearances in <hi>Scotland:</hi> Neither was this all.</item>

                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:101025:212"/>As this General Assembly did thus stand its ground, and appeared for <hi>Imparity,</hi> so it continued of the same sentiments and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions with former Assemblies, in the Matter of the Churches <hi>Patrimony</hi>; For, By it, it was resolved also, <hi>That they might proceed against unjust possessors of the Patrimony of the Church, in respect of the Notorious Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, not only by Doctrine and Admonition, but with the Censures of the Church, and that the Patrimony of the Church, whereupon the Church, the Poor and the Schools should be maintained, was</hi> ex jure divino. So 'tis in the MS. and so <hi>Petrie</hi> hath it: <note n="(s)" place="margin">Pet. 387.</note> Well! Did the <hi>Parity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> gain no ground in this Assembly? Yes, they did: Two things they obtained, which were very useful for them afterwards. They obtained

                     <item>1. And Act to be made <hi>That the Bishops should be obliged to take the charge of particular Congregations.</hi> 'Tis true, the Assembly could not get this refused after they had approved and affirmed the above-mentioned Articles. For, it was fairly deduceable both from the second and third: But then, it is plain, this Act did militate nothing against the <hi>Essentials</hi> of Episcopacy: It was highly consistent with <hi>Imparity</hi> amongst the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of the Church: and the Articles evidently import as much: However, as I said, this proved very serviceable to the <hi>Melvilian Party,</hi> afterwards, as we shall hear. But this was not the worst of it: For</item>

The <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Morton,</hi> then, <hi>Regent</hi> (whatever the Presbyterian Historians talk of his being so much for Episcopacy) made a very ill-favoured, as well as a very fatal step in the time of this Assembly: Take it in <hi>Spotswoods</hi> words, <note n="(t)" place="margin">Spot. 276.</note> 
                        <hi>The Regent hearing how the Church had proceeded, and taking ill the Deposition of Master</hi> James Patton <hi>Bishop of</hi> Dunkeld, <hi>who was, in the former Assembly, deprived for Dilapidation of his benifice, sent to require of them</hi> (this Assembly met in April 1576) <hi>whether they would stand to the Policy agreed unto at</hi> Leith? <hi>And if not, to desire them to settle upon some form of Government at which they would abide.</hi>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Champions</hi> for <hi>Parity</hi> had fairly met with a second repulse from this Assembly, as I have discoursed, and if all concerned had acted their parts, as they might and ought to have done, and as the cause required, 'tis highly credible, that <hi>Mother of confusion</hi> might have been quit crush't and stifled for ever: But that was not done; The <hi>Prelates</hi> themselves were negligent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active, as <hi>Spotswood</hi> intimates, <note n="(u)" place="margin">Spot. 276.</note> and here, the Regent made this proposition. A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, than which, none could be made more surprizingly obliging and acceptable to the Presbyterian Party. All things consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, it was the very thing, the common principles of conduct might have taught them to have askt, <hi>next,</hi> if they had had things for the <hi>asking</hi>; For what can fall out more luckily for those who have a mind to
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:101025:213"/>
innovate, than to have the <hi>old</hi> foundations <hi>shaken,</hi> and <hi>leave</hi> allowed to erect <hi>new Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels</hi>? So ill-favoured (I say) was this step, which, at this time, was made by <hi>Morton,</hi> who, by the <hi>exigencies</hi> of his <hi>station,</hi> was bound to have guarded against all innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, especially such as had so natural a tendency to disturb the publick peace; and therefore I must ask my Readers allowance to make a little digression, if it may be called a digression, and discourse this Question,</p>
               <p>Whether it may not be thought probable that <hi>Morton</hi> made this proposition <hi>Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately,</hi> and from ane <hi>Intention</hi> to <hi>Cherish</hi> the <hi>Presbyterian Party,</hi> and encourage their <hi>humor</hi> for innovating, and confounding the <hi>Peace</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>?</p>
               <p>This, perhaps, at first sight, may seem a bold Question, as not only being <hi>New,</hi> but apparently <hi>Crossing</hi> the received accounts of our Presbyterian Historians; But if I can make the affirmative very probable (if not evident) I am apt to think, it may bring no small accessions of light to the present subject I am insisting on, <hi>viz.</hi> how Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterianism was first introduced into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi> I will therefore lay down my Reasons for it, that the world may judge of them; and</p>
               <p n="1">1. That which I have already descoursed, seems to be a very fair Argument that <hi>Morton</hi> made this proposition, <hi>intentionally,</hi> to give <hi>scope</hi> and <hi>slackened Reins</hi> to the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Party; For if he had not made it;
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:101025:213"/>
if he had resolved to stand by the <hi>Agreement</hi> at <hi>Leith</hi>; if he had been serious for the Established Government and Peace of the Church; It had been easy for him to have supprest all <hi>Melvil</hi>'s <hi>Projects</hi> for innovation. He had visibly, the major part of this Assembly, of his side, if that had been his <hi>Aim</hi>; No appearance that the Body of the People was then infected with the principles of <hi>Parity.</hi> The Nobility were generally for the old constitution, as is evident from no less Authority than <hi>Melvil</hi>'s own, in his Letter to <hi>Beza</hi> cited before, in which he tells him, He and his Party <hi>had many of the Peers against them</hi>; <note n="(v)" place="margin">Pet. 401.</note> where, then, was there the least difficulty of <hi>Crushing</hi> the <hi>Coccatrice</hi> in the <hi>Egg,</hi> if he had had a mind for it? Besides, how inconsistent was the making of this proposition with the <hi>Integrity</hi> and <hi>Honesty</hi> of a <hi>Regent</hi>? The <hi>King</hi> was, then, a <hi>Minor</hi>; The Nation had but just, then, emerged out of a vast Ocean of civil broyls and troubles, which had long harassed it, and kept it in confusion; nothing more improper for it than to be involved again, instantly, in jarrs and discords; So that if he had no such <hi>Plot,</hi> as I am endeavouring to make probable he had, he was, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, very unfortunate in granting such a <hi>Liberty</hi>; For, considering all things, it looks so very like a <hi>Plot,</hi> that it cannot but be very hard to perswade a thinking man that there was none. Especially if it be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:101025:214"/>2. That he was a Man, who had <hi>latitude</hi> enough, to do ill things, if he thought them subservient to his <hi>interest.</hi> He was wretchedly <hi>Covetous,</hi> as all Historians agree: And that vice alone disposes a Man for the worst things. He hath observed little of the affairs of the world, and the extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gances of Mankind, who has not observed <hi>Avarice</hi> and a sordid temper to have put Men on the most abominable courses: who hath not observed, who hath not <hi>seen,</hi> that Men have sold Religion, Honour, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, Loyalty, Faith, Friendship, every thing that's sacred, for Money? Now by making this proposition, He projected a very fair opportunity for gratifying this his predomining appetite. He had so anxiously coveted the Emoluments of the <hi>Arch-Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> of <hi>St. Andrews</hi> in the year 1571 (as <hi>Sir Iames Melvil</hi> tells us in his <hi>Memoirs</hi> 
                  <note n="(w)" place="margin">Mel. Mem. 110.</note> that meeting with a repulse, he forsook the Court, and was so much discontented, that he would not return to it, till <hi>Randolf</hi> the <hi>English</hi> Ambassadour perswaded <hi>Lennox,</hi> then Regent, to give it to him; Promising that the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>England</hi> should recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence it to him with greater advantage. How much of that <hi>Bishoprick</hi> he had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued still to possess, after the <hi>Agreement</hi> at <hi>Leith,</hi> and <hi>Douglass's</hi> advancement to that <hi>Arch-Bishoprick,</hi> I cannot tell; But it is not to be doubted, whatever it was, it sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened his stomack for more of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Revenues; and now, the juncture
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:101025:214"/>
made wonderfully for him; For, as he had found by experience, and many Acts of Assemblies, &amp;c. That the Church, careful of her interests, and watchful over her Patrimony, was no ways inclined to sit still and suffer her self to be cheated, and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, according to his hungry inclinations; but was making, and like to continue to make vigorous opposition to all such sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious purposes, so long as she continued united, and settled on the foot on which she then stood; So he found, that, now, Contention was arising within her own Bowels, and a Party was appearing zealous for innovations, and her peace and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity were like to be broken and divided; and what more proper for him, in these circumstances, than to lay the reins on their necks, and cast a further <hi>bone of Contention</hi> amongst them? He knew full well what it was <hi>to fish in troubled waters,</hi> as <hi>Sir Iames Melvil</hi> observes of him, <note n="(x)" place="margin">Mel. Mem. Ibid.</note> and so 'tis more than probable he would not neglect such ane opportunity, still so much the more, if it be considered,</p>
               <p n="3">3. That whatever professions he might have made, in former times, of good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to Episcopal Government, yet there is little reason to think that his Conscience was interested in the matter; For besides that covetous, selfish, subtle men, such as he was, use not to allow themselves to stand too precisely upon all the Dictates of a <hi>Nice</hi> and tender Conscience; The <hi>Divine
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:101025:215"/>
Right</hi> of Episcopacy, (the true <hi>fund</hi> for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it matter of Conscience) in these times was not much asserted or thought on: That was not, till several years afterwards, when the Controversies about the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church came to be sifted more narrowly: It is commonly acknowledged that the main Argument which prevailed with <hi>him</hi> to appear for Episcopacy, was its aptitude for being part of a <hi>fund</hi> for a <hi>good Correspondence</hi> with <hi>England. Spotswood</hi> tells us, <note n="(y)" place="margin">Spot. 276.</note> that one of the Injunctions which he got when he was made Regent, was, <hi>That he should be careful to entertain the Amity contracted with the Queen of England.</hi> And <hi>Calderwood</hi> saith thus expressly of him, <note n="(z)" place="margin">Cald. 66.</note> 
                  <hi>His great intention was to bring in conformity with England, in the Church Government, without which, he thought, he could not Govern the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey to his Fantasie, or, that, Agreement could stand long between the two Countreys.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,<note n="(a)" place="margin">Cald. 80.</note> 
                  <hi>He pressed his own injunctions and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity with England.</hi> Now this being the great motive that made him so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, at any time, for Episcopal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; It is to be considered,</p>
               <p n="4">4. That, however prevalent this might be with him, when, first, he was advanced to the Regency, civil Dissentions raging then, and the Party, of which he was the Head, being unable to subsist, unless sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by <hi>England</hi>; Yet now, that all these Dissentions were ended, and the Countrey quieted, and things brought to some appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:101025:215"/>
of a durable settlement; His Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on <hi>England</hi> might prompt him to alter his <hi>scheme,</hi> and incline him to give scope to the Presbyterian <hi>wild-fire</hi> in <hi>Scotland.</hi> To set this presumption in its due light, Two things are to be a little further enquired into<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>First, this is certain, it was still one of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s great cares to Encourage confusions in <hi>Scotland.</hi> She knew her own <hi>Title</hi> was <hi>Questionable,</hi> as I have observed before; and tho' that had not been, yet, without Question the <hi>Scottish blood</hi> had the next <hi>best</hi> Title to the <hi>English Crown:</hi> and as 'tis Natural to most People to worship the rising Sun, especially when he looks Bright and Glorious; when he has no Clouds about him; I mean, the <hi>Apparent Heir</hi> of a Throne, when he is in a prosperous and flourishing condition; So, 'tis as Natural for the <hi>Regnant Prince</hi> to be <hi>jealous</hi> of him. Therefore, I say Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> for her own security, did still what she could to <hi>Kindle</hi> wildfire in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>keep</hi> it <hi>burning,</hi> when it was <hi>Kindled.</hi> Thus, in the year 1560.

She countenanced the <hi>Scottish</hi> Lords who began to raise tumults about the <hi>Scottish</hi> Queens Marriage with the Lord <hi>Darnley</hi>; She furnisht them with money, and harbour'd them when they were forced to flee for it. And how long did She foment our <hi>Civil wars</hi> after they brake out <hi>Anno</hi> 1567? What dubious Responses did She give, all the time She <hi>Vmpir'd</hi> it, between the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> and those who appeared for <hi>her Son?</hi> And is it not very well known that She had ane hand in the <hi>Road</hi> of <hi>Ruthven</hi> 1582, and in all our <hi>Scottish seditions,</hi> Generally? <hi>Sir Iames Melvil</hi> in his <hi>Memoirs</hi> gives us enough of her Practices that way: He lived in these times, and was acquainted with intrigues; and he tells us, <note n="(b)" place="margin">Mel.

                  <q>That <hi>Randolf</hi> came with <hi>Lennox</hi> (when he came to <hi>Scotland,</hi> to be <hi>Regent,</hi> after <hi>Murray</hi>'s death) to stay here as <hi>English Resident</hi>: That this <hi>Randolf</hi>'s great imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was to foster discords, and increase Divisions among the <hi>Scots,</hi> particularly, <hi>That he used Craft with the Ministers,</hi>

Thus practiced Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> and such were her Arts and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences in <hi>Scotland,</hi> before she had the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of <hi>improving</hi> the Presbyterian humour to her purposes: And can it be imagined she would not encourage it when once it got sooting? Certainly she understood it, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than so: The <hi>Sect</hi> had set up a <hi>Presbytery</hi> at <hi>Wandsworth</hi> in <hi>Surrey</hi> in the year 1572, four years before <hi>Morton</hi> made this <hi>Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> seven years before a <hi>Presbytery</hi> was so much as heard of in <hi>Scotland</hi>; No doubt she knew the <hi>Spirit</hi> well enough, and how apt and well suited, it was for keeping a <hi>State</hi> in disorder and trouble.

at <hi>Leith:</hi> And it had been received by the General Assembly in <hi>August</hi> 1572. for ane <hi>Interim</hi> only: The revising of that <hi>Agreement,</hi> might end some Controversies; and the Regent having made this Proposition, it was not to be doubted, but he would Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify what they should Unanimously agree to, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These and the like Arguments I say, might, ('tis clear, some Arguments did) prevail with the Assembly to entertain the Proposition: For</p>

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:101025:218"/>
a great deal of Order and Beauty in it; and nothing that naturally tended to have a bad influence, on either the principles or the life of serious Christianity: And with that they were satisfied: Indeed even the best of them seem to have had very little skill in the true fountains whence the solid subsistence of the <hi>Episcopal Order</hi> was to be derived; The Scriptures I mean, not as <hi>Glossed</hi> by the <hi>Private Spirit</hi> of every <hi>Modern Novelist,</hi> but as interpreted and understood by the <hi>First</hi> ages; as <hi>sensed</hi> by the constant and universal practice, of Genuine, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive and Catholick Antiquity.</p>
               <p>This charge of Ignorance, in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies about the Government of the Church, which I have brought against the <hi>Scottish</hi> Clergy, in these times, will certainly leave a blot upon my self, if I cannot prove it: But if I can prove it, it is clear, it is of considerable importance in the present dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition, and helps much for coming, by a just comprehension, to understand how <hi>Presbytery</hi> was introduced into <hi>Scotland.</hi> And therefore I must again beg my Readers patience, till I adduce some evidences for it. And</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The truth of this charge may be obviously collected from the whole train of their proceedings, and management, about the Government of the Church, from the very first Establishment of the Reformation: For however they Established a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which clearly subsisted by <hi>imparity,</hi> as
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:101025:219"/>
I have fully proven, and which was all I still aim'd at, yet, it is easy to Discover they were very far from keeping <hi>Closely</hi> by the Principles and Measures of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive constitution of Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This is so very apparent to any who Reads the Histories of these times, and is so visible in the Deduction I have made, that I shall insist no longer on it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The truth of my charge may further appear, from the Instance of <hi>Adam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> advanced, this year 1576, to the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishoprick</hi> of <hi>St. Andrews.</hi> That Nature had furnished him with a good stock, and he was a smart Man, and cultivated beyond the ordinary <hi>Size,</hi> by many parts of good Literature, is not denyed by the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Historians themselves; They never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to represent him as a <hi>Fool</hi> or a <hi>Dunce,</hi> tho' they are very eager to have him a Man of <hi>Tricks</hi> and <hi>Latitude.</hi>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Now this</hi> Prelates <hi>ignorance in true Antiquity is Remarkably visible in his subscribing to these Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> (Anno <hi>1580, if we may believe</hi> Calder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, <note n="(p)" place="margin">

That in the Council of</hi> Nice <hi>for eschewing of private ordaining of Ministers, it was statuted, that no Pastor should be appointed without the consent of him, who dwelt or remained in the Chief and Principal City of the Province, which they called the Metropolitan City. That after, in the latter Councils, it was statuted, (that things might proceed more solemnly and with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Authority) that the laying on of hands upon Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, after Lawful Election, should be by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan, or Bishop of the Chief and principal Town, the rest of the Bishops of the Province voting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; In which thing, there was no other Prerogative, but only that of the Town, which, for that cause, was thought most meet both for the conveening of the Council, and Ordaining of Pastors with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Consent and Authority. That the Estate of the Church was corrupt, when the name, Bishop, which before, was common to the rest of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors of the Province, began, without the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Gods Word and ancient Custome of the Kirk to be attributed to one. That the power of appointing and ordaining Ministers, and Ruling of Kirks with the whole procuration of Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Discipline, was, now, only, devolved to one Metropolitan; The other Pastors no ways chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging their Right and Privilege therein, of very slothfulness, on the one part; And the Devil, on the other, going about, craftily, to lay the ground of the Papistical Supremacy.</hi>

sign'd by him, at that time, it may be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I say, if this <hi>Prelate</hi> did not bewray a very profound ignorance in true Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Antiquity? Ane <hi>Arrant Presbyterian</hi> could not have <hi>said,</hi> could not have <hi>wished</hi> more Indeed, 'tis more than probable (as perchance may appear by and by) that these Propositions were taken out, (either formally, or by collection) of Mr. <hi>Beza's</hi> Book <hi>De Triplici Episcopatu.</hi> Now if <hi>Adamson</hi> was so little seen in such matters, what may we judge of the rest?

How easy had it been for men skilled in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, Government and Discipline of the Primitive Church to have laid open, to the Conviction of all sober Men, the novelty, the vanity, the inexpediency, the impoliticalness, the uncatholicalness of most, if not all, of these Propositions?

                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> from this plain matter of Fact, <hi>viz.</hi> that that Second Book of Discipline, in many points, is taken word for word from Mr. <hi>Beza</hi>'s <hi>Answers</hi> to the <hi>Questions</hi> proposed to him, by <hi>The Lord Glamis,</hi> then <hi>Chancellor</hi> of <hi>Scotland.</hi> A fair Evidence that our Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, at that time, have not been very well seen in Ecclesiastical Politicks; Otherwise, it is not to be thought they would have been so imposed on, by a single stranger Divine, who visibly aimed at the propagation of the <hi>Scheme,</hi> which by <hi>chance,</hi> had got footing in the Church where he lived. His Tractate <hi>De Triplici Episcopatu,</hi> written of purpose for the advancement of Presbyterianism in <hi>Scotland,</hi> carries visibly in its whole train, that its design was to draw our Clergy from off the <hi>Ancient</hi> Polity of the Church; and his Answers to the <hi>Six Questions</hi> propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to him, (as I said) by <hi>Glanus,</hi> contain'd the <hi>New Scheme,</hi> he advised them to.

let us taste a little of his skill in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution and Government of the Ancient Church, or, if you please, of his accounts of her Policy. I take his <hi>Book</hi> as I find it amongst <hi>Saravia</hi>'s works.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of many such learned Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, I have collected out of that Book, which was so successful, at that time, in furthering and advancing the Presbyterian Principles, in <hi>Scotland</hi>; And could they be a learned Clergy? Could they be great Masters at Antiquity and Ecclesiastical Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, who swallowed down these Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, or were imposed on, by the <hi>Book</hi> that contain'd them? 'Tis true this Book came not to <hi>Scotland</hi> till the end of the year 1577, or the beginning of 1578. But I thought it pardonable to anticipate so far, as, now, to give this account of it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering how proper it was for my present purpose. We shall have occasion to take further notice of it afterward.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:101025:222"/>Thus, I think, I have made it appear how advantageous <hi>Morton</hi>'s Proposition was to the Presbyterian party: They had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, by it, to fall upon forming a <hi>New Scheme</hi> of Church Governmet and Polity; They were as well prepared, as they could be for such a nick; and they had a set of people to deal with, who might easily be worsted in these Controversies. However it seems, the common principles of Politicks, which God and Nature have made, if not inseparable parts, at least, ordinary conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitants of sound and solid reason, did some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times make their appearances amongst them; For, that there have been Disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Contests, and that some, at least, of the many propositions, contained in the <hi>Second Book of Discipline,</hi> have been debated and tossed, is evident from the many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, were about it, and the long time was spent before it was perfected and got its finishing stroke from a General Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, as we shall find, in our progress. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed we now in our deduction.</p>
               <p>Tho' the Presbyterian Faction had gain'd this advantage in the Assembly 1576, that they had allowance to draw a new Scheme of Polity, to which they could not but apply themselves very chearfully; yet, it seems, they were so much humbled by the Repulses they had got, as to the main Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Lawfulness of Episcopacy,</hi> that they thought it not expedient to try the next Assembly with it, directly, as they
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:101025:222"/>
had done, unsuccessfully, twice before; But to wait a little, till their party should be stronger; and, in the mean time to content themselves with such indirect blows as they could conveniently give it; such, I say, their deliberations seem to have been, at the next Assembly which was holden at <hi>Edenburgh, Octob</hi> 24. 1576. For not so much as one word, in that Assembly concerning the <hi>Lawfulness,</hi> or <hi>Unlawfulness</hi> of <hi>Prelacy,</hi> either, <hi>Simply,</hi> and in it self; Or, <hi>Complexely,</hi> as, <hi>then, in use in Scotland.</hi> 'Tis true,</p>

That he was affraid he might incur the Guilt of Perjury, and be called in question, by the King, for changing a member of state, if he should change any thing belonging to the Order, Manner, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, or Power of his Bishoprick: That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could not bind himself to a particular Flock, nor prejudge the power of Iurisdiction, which he had received with his Bishoprick,</hi> &amp;c. Thus he answered, I say, and the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, at that time, satisfied themselves, so far, with this answer, that they pressed him no further, but referred the matter to the next Assembly, as even both <hi>Calderwood</hi> and <hi>Petrie</hi> acknowledge. <note n="(l)" place="margin">Cald. 74.

These Meetings, it seems, had been much neglected and disfrequented in most places.

in both Instances, that which was refused them by the last Assembly: However, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing done <hi>Directly</hi> (as I said) against the Episcopal Office: On the contrary, <hi>Adam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>

               <p>May I not reckon the <hi>Fast</hi> appointed by this Assembly, as a <hi>third</hi> step gained by our <hi>Parity-men? A successful Establishment of perfect Order and Polity in the Kirk,</hi> was one of the reasons for it. <note n="(q)" place="margin">MS. Cald. 79.

               <p>I find also that Commissioners were sent by this Assembly to the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Morton</hi> to acquaint him that they were busy about the matter and argument of the Polity; and that his Grace should receive Advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their further proceedings; and that these Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>issioners, having returned from him, to the Assembly, reported, That <hi>His Grace liked well of their travels and labours, in that matter</hi>; and <hi>required expedition and haste; Promising, that when the particulars should be given in to him, they should receive a good Answer.</hi> 
                  <note n="(r)" place="margin">Cald. 77.</note> So <hi>Calderwood</hi> and the <hi>MS.</hi>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:101025:224"/>
From which, two things may be observed: the <hi>First,</hi> is, a further Confirmation of the suspicion I insisted on before, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Morton</hi> was truly a Friend to the Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. The <hi>second,</hi> that the <hi>Second Book of Discipline</hi> had hitherto gone on but very slowly: Why else would his Grace have so earnestly required <hi>Expedition</hi> and <hi>hasty Outred</hi> (as the <hi>MS.</hi> words it, <hi>i. e. Dispatch</hi>) and promised them a good answer when the particulars should be given in to him? The truth is, there was one good reason for their proceeding so leisurely in the matter of the <hi>Book: Beza</hi>'s <hi>Answer</hi> to <hi>Glamis</hi> his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was not yet returned.</p>
               <p>Thus two General Assemblies passed, without so much as offering at a plain, a direct <hi>Trust</hi> against <hi>Imparity</hi>: Nay, it seems matters were not come to a sufficient Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity for that, even against the next As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly.</p>
               <p>It was holden at <hi>Edenburgh, Octob.</hi> 25. 1577. And not so much as one word in the <hi>MS. Calderwood</hi> or <hi>Petrie,</hi> relating either directly or indirectly to the main Question. But two things happened a little after this Assembly, which animated <hi>Melvil</hi> and his <hi>Party</hi> to purpose.</p>
               <p>One was, <hi>Morton</hi>'s quitting the <hi>Regency</hi>: For, whatever services he had done them, he was so <hi>obscure</hi> and <hi>Fetching</hi> in his measures, and so little to be trusted, that they could not rely much upon him: And now that he had demitted, they had a fair prospect
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:101025:225"/>
of playing their game to better purpose than ever: They were in possessions of the <hi>Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> he had granted them to draw a <hi>New Scheme</hi> of Policy; They had a <hi>Young King</hi> who had not yet arrived at the twelfth year of his Age, to deal with; By conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence they were like to have a <hi>divided</hi> Court and a <hi>Factious</hi> Nobility; and they needed not doubt, if there were <hi>two Factions</hi> in the Kingdom, that <hi>one</hi> of them would be sure to <hi>Court</hi> them, and undertake to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their <hi>Interests.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other encouragement, which did them every whit as good service, was <hi>Beza</hi>'s Book, <hi>De Triplici Episcopatu, Divino, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mano, &amp; Satanico,</hi> with his <hi>Answers</hi> to the <hi>Lord Glamis</hi> his <hi>Questions,</hi> which about this time was brought to <hi>Scotland:</hi> as is clear from <hi>Calderwood.</hi> 
                  <note n="(s)" place="margin">Cald: 79.</note> 
                  <hi>Beza,</hi> it seems, put to it, to Defend the Constitution of the Church of <hi>Geneva</hi> had imployed his wit and parts (which certainly were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible) in <hi>patching</hi> together such a <hi>Scheme</hi> of principles, as, he thought, might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended: That's a method most men take too frequently, First, to resolve upon a <hi>Conclusion,</hi> and then, to stretch their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions and spend their pains for finding <hi>Colours</hi> and <hi>plausibilities</hi> to set it off with. <hi>Beza,</hi> therefore, I say, having been thus at pains to digest his thoughts the best way he could on this subject; and withal being possibly, not a little elevated, That the <hi>Lord High Chancellor</hi> of a <hi>Foreign Kingdom,</hi>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:101025:225"/>
should Consult him, and ask his Advice concerning a point of so great importance as the constitution of the Government of a National Church; Thought it not enough, it seems, to return an Answer to his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships Questions, and therein give him a <hi>Scheme</hi>; which was very easy for him to do, considering, he needed be at little more pains, than to transcribe the <hi>Genevian</hi> Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment; But he applied himself to the main Controversie which had been started by his Disciple, <hi>Melvil,</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> (and 'tis scarcely to be doubted that it was done at his instignation) and wrote this his Book, wherein, tho' he asserted not the <hi>absolute Vnlawfulness</hi> of that which he called <hi>Humane Episcopacy</hi> (he had not <hi>brow</hi> enough for that, as we have seen already), <note n="(t)" place="margin">In the page of these pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.</note> yet he made it wonderously dangerous, as being so natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally apt to Degenerate into the Devilish, the <hi>Satanical</hi> Episcopacy. This Book, I say, came to <hi>Scotland,</hi> about this time, <hi>viz.</hi> either in the end of 1577. or the beginning of 1578. and (tho' I have already given a <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen</hi> of it) who now could hold up his head to plead for <hi>Prelacy?</hi> Here was a <hi>Book</hi> written by the Famous Mr. <hi>Beza,</hi> the <hi>Successor</hi> of the great Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi>; the present great <hi>Lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> of the Church of <hi>Geneva</hi>; our <hi>Elder</hi> Sister Church; the <hi>Best</hi> Reformed Church in Christendom; Who would not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced now that Parity ought to be Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished and <hi>Popish Prelacy</hi> abolished? And<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> indeed, it seems, this <hi>Book</hi> came, seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:101025:226"/>
to help the <hi>good new cause</hi> (for it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved to take some time before it could merit the name of the <hi>good old one</hi>) for, we have already seen how slowly and weakly it advanced before the Book came: But now we shall find it gathering strength apace, and advancing with a witness. Nay, at the very next Assembly it was in a pretty flourishing condition.</p>
               <p>This next Ass. met, <hi>Apr.</hi> 24. <hi>Anno</hi> 1578. And Mr. <hi>Andrew Melvil</hi> was chosen <hi>Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>; the <hi>Prince</hi> of the <hi>Sect</hi> had the happiness to be the <hi>Praeses</hi> of the <hi>Assembly,</hi> and present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the work was set a going. Amongst the first things done, in this Ass<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>, it was enacted, <hi>That Bishops and all others bearing Ecclesiastical Function, should be called by their own names, or Brethren, in all time coming.</hi>

                  </note> No more Lord Bishops! and it was but consequential to the great Argument, which was, then, and, ever since, hath been in the mouths of all the party, <hi>The Lords of the Gentiles,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Matt.</hi> 20.25. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.25.

                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:101025:226"/>
of Dignity and Honour. <note n="(v)" place="margin">Spot. 303.</note> But,</p>
               <p>Another more important Act was made, by this Assembly; Take it, word for word from <hi>Calderwood</hi> who agrees exactly with both the <hi>MS.</hi> and <hi>Pet.</hi> 
                  <note n="(w)" place="margin">Cald. 81. Pet. 394.</note> 
                  <hi>Forasmuch as there is great corruption in the State of Bishops, as they are presently set up, in this Realm, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the Assembly would provide some stay, in time coming, so far as they may, to the effect that far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther corruption may be bridled; The Assembly hath concluded, that no Bishop shall be Elected or Admitted before the next General Assembly; Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging all Ministers and Chapters to proceed, any ways, to the Election of the said Bishops, in the mean time, under the pain of perpetual De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation; And that this matter, be proponed first in the next Assembly, to be consulted what farther Order shall be taken therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here was ground gain'd indeed; How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, this was but preparatory still; No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, yet, concluded concerning the <hi>Vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi> of the Office; It was consistent with this Act that Episcopacy should have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, its corruptions being removed. Neither are we, as yet, told what these corruptions were; It seems, even the Presbyterians themselves, tho' in a fair con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, now, to be the prevailing party, had not yet agreed about them. Indeed. another Assembly must be over, before we can come by them. Leaving them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore till we come at them; proceed we with this present Assembly.</p>
               <p>Another <hi>Fast</hi> was appointed by it; The
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:101025:227"/>
Nation, it seems, was not yet sufficiently diposed for Presbytery: Rubs and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were still cast in the way; and the good cause was deplorably retarded. So 'tis fairly imported in the Act for this Fast: <hi>The corruption of all Estates: Coldness in a great part of the Professors: That God would put it in the Kings heart and the hearts of the Estates of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, to Establish such a Policy and Discipline in the Kirk, as is craved in the word of God,</hi> &amp;c. These are amongst the prime Reasons in the narrative of this Act for Fasting. <note n="(x)" place="margin">MS. Pet. 394. Cald. 81.</note> Indeed, all this time the Book of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline was only in forming; It had not yet got the Assemblies Approbation.</p>
               <p>The next General Assembly met at <hi>Stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, Iune</hi> 11. this same year, about six weeks or so, after the Dissolution of the former: But the Parliament was to sit; and it was needful the Assembly should sit, before, to order Ecclesiastick business for it. And, now, it seems there was little struggling; For the Assembly, <hi>all in one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> voice</hi> (as it is in <hi>MS. Calderwood</hi> and <hi>Petrie,</hi> 
                  <note n="(y)" place="margin">MS. Cald. 82. Pet. 395.</note> concluded, <hi>That the Act of the last Assembly, discharging the Election of Bishops,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>should be extended to all time coming:</hi> And here <hi>Petrie</hi> stops; But the <hi>MS.</hi> and <hi>Calderwood</hi> add, <hi>ay and while, the corruptions of the Estate of Bishops, be, all utterly, taken away.</hi> And they ordained, <hi>That all Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops already Elected should submit themselves to the Gen. Ass. Concerning the Reformation of the Corruptions of that Estate of Bishops, in their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; Which, if they refused to do, after Admonition,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:101025:227"/>
that they should be proceeded against to Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.</hi> This Ass. met, as I said on the 11<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Iune,</hi> and indeed it seems the <hi>weather</hi> has been <hi>warm</hi> enough: Yet neither, now, did they adventure again upon the <hi>Main Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,</hi> nor ennumerate the <hi>Corruptions</hi> of the <hi>Estate</hi> of <hi>Bishops.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this Assembly, a Commission was also granted to certain Persons to attend the Parliament, and Petition that the <hi>Book of Discipline</hi> might be Ratified; Tho' all the Articles were not, as yet, agreed to. A pretty <hi>Odd</hi> overture, to desire the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to <hi>Ratify</hi> what they themselves had not perfectly <hi>Concerted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next <hi>Assembly</hi> met at <hi>Edenburgh, Octob.</hi> 24. of that same year 1578. And it was but reasonable to have <hi>three</hi> Assemblies in <hi>six</hi> Months, when the Church was so <hi>big</hi> with <hi>Presbytery.</hi> And, now, the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, so frequently talk't of before, were ennumerated; and the Bishops were required to Reform them in their Persons. They were required, 1. <hi>To be Ministers or Pastors of one Flock.</hi> 2. <hi>To usurp no Criminal Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</hi> 3. <hi>Not to vote in Parliament in Name of the Kirk, without Commission from the General Assembly.</hi> 4. <hi>Not to take up, for maintaining their Ambition and Riotousness, the Emoluments of the Kirk, which ought to sustain many Pastors, the Schools, and the Poor; But to be content with reasonable livings, according to their Office.</hi> 5. <hi>Not to claim the Titles of Temporal Lords, nor usurp Civil Iurisdiction, whereby, they might be
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:101025:228"/>
Abstracted from their Office.</hi> 6. <hi>Not to Empire it over particular Elderships, but be subject to the same</hi>: So the <hi>MS. Calderwood</hi> and <hi>Petrie</hi> have it, tho' <hi>Spotswood</hi> has the word, <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries</hi>; <note n="(z)" place="margin">MS. Cald. 85. Pet. 397. Spot. 303.</note> Which I take notice of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the unwary Reader, when he reads, <hi>Presbyteries,</hi> in <hi>Spotswood,</hi> may take them for these Ecclesiastical Judicatories which now are so denominated, whereas there were none <hi>such</hi> as yet in the Nation. 7. <hi>Not to usurp the Power of the Pastors</hi> (says the <hi>MS.</hi>) <hi>nor take upon them to visit any Bounds not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them by the Church.</hi> 8. And lastly, <hi>If any more Corruptions should, afterward, be found in the Estate of Bishops, to consent to have them Reformed.</hi> These were the <hi>Corruptions</hi>: and particularly at that same very time, the <hi>two Archbishops</hi> were required to <hi>Reform them in their Persons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What <hi>Adamson,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>St. Andrews</hi> did, or said, on this occasion, I know not; But, it seems he submitted not: For I find him, again, required to do it by the next Assembly. And that it was particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly laid to his charge that he had opposed the <hi>Ratification</hi> of the <hi>Book</hi> in Parliament. But,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Boyd</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Glasgow</hi> did certainly behave at this Assembly like a Person of great worth and a Man of <hi>Courage,</hi> suitable to his <hi>Character,</hi> giving a <hi>brave</hi> and <hi>resolute</hi> Answer: You may see it in <hi>Spot.

                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">Spot. 303. Cald. 84. Pet. 396.</note> I have not leisure to transcribe it: But it pleased not the, <hi>now,</hi> too much Presbyterian Assembly; and no wonder,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:101025:228"/>
for he spake truely like a Bishop.</p>
               <p>The next Assembly was holden at <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> in <hi>Iuly, Anno</hi> 1579.
<q>The King sent a Letter to them, whereby he signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his dislike of their former proceedings, and fairly advised them to shew more temper, and proceed more deliberately.</q>
                  <hi>Calderwood</hi> calls it ane <hi>Harsh Letter:</hi> It is to be seen, word for word, both in him and <hi>Petrie.</hi> 
                  <note n="(b)" place="margin">Cald. 86. Pet. 398.</note> But what had they to do with the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>this World,</hi> especially such <hi>Babie Kings</hi> as King <hi>Iames</hi> was, then; they, I say, who had now the Government of <hi>Christs Kingdom</hi> to <hi>settle</hi>? However, no more was done against <hi>Prelacy,</hi> at this time, than had been ordered formerly. Indeed there was little more to be done, but to declare the Office abolished; But that, it seems they were not yet <hi>Ripe</hi> for; Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance the <hi>Corruptions</hi> mentioned before had proved a little <hi>Choaking,</hi> and peoples sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs could not be, so soon, disposed, for another <hi>dish</hi> of such <hi>strong meat</hi> in ane instant; so, <hi>that</hi> was reserved till the next Assembly. Nevertheless,</p>
               <p>In the mean time take we Notice of one thing which we never heard of before; which started up in this Assembly; and which must not be forgotten. <hi>It was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by the Synod of</hi> Lothian (saith <hi>Calderwood,</hi> 
                  <note n="(c)" place="margin">Cald. 88.</note> 
                  <hi>That a General Order might be taken for Erecting of</hi> Presbyteries <hi>in places where publick exercise was used, until the Polity of the Church might be Established by Law.</hi> And it was An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:101025:229"/>
by the Assembly, <hi>That the exercise was a Presbytery,</hi> 
                  <note n="(d)" place="margin">MS. Cald. 88. Pet. 400.</note>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Presbytery</hi> turned afterwards, and, now, is, one of the most specifick, essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and indispensible parts of the <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> constitution. <hi>Provincial Synods</hi> can sit only <hi>twice</hi> in the year, <hi>General Assemblies,</hi> only <hi>once,</hi> according to the Constitution. 'Tis true, 'tis allowed to the King to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate <hi>one</hi> extraordinarily, <hi>&amp; pro re natà</hi> as they call it: And the <hi>Kirk</hi> claims to have such a power too, as <hi>she</hi> sees occasion. But then 'tis as true, that Kings have been so disgusted at such meetings that they have hindred General Assemblies to meet for many years: So that their meetings are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain; and in innumerable cases, there should be too long a <hi>Surcease</hi> of <hi>Ecclesiastical Iustice,</hi> if <hi>Causes</hi> should wait, either on <hi>them,</hi> or <hi>Provincial Synods.</hi> The <hi>Commission of the General Assembly,</hi> as they call it, is but ane accidental thing: The suddain dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a General Assembly can disappoint its very being; as just now there is none, nor has been, since the last Assembly, which was so surprizingly dissolved in <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi> 1692. When there is such a <hi>Court,</hi> it commonly sits but <hi>once</hi> in <hi>three</hi> Months; and it meddles not with every matter; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, many of themselves do not love it; and look upon it as ane error in the <hi>Custome</hi> of the <hi>Kirk,</hi> for it was never made <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>Constitution</hi> by any <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Kirk</hi> nor <hi>Act</hi> of Parliament.

               </p>
               <p>That which was called the <hi>Exercise</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, was nothing like a <hi>Court</hi>; had no imaginable <hi>Iurisdiction</hi>; Could neither <hi>Injoyn Pennance</hi> to the <hi>smallest Offender,</hi> nor <hi>Absolve</hi> him from it; It could exert no Acts of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:101025:230"/>
It had not so much <hi>Power</hi> as the meanest <hi>Kirk-session</hi>: It was nothing like a <hi>Presbytery</hi>: and, however it was said, in this Assembly, <hi>That the Exercise was a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,</hi> yet, that saying (as <hi>omnipotent</hi> as a Presbyterian Assembly is) did not make it <hi>one.</hi> That was not a <hi>Factive</hi> proposition. There were no <hi>Presbyteries</hi> erected at this time: The <hi>First</hi> that was erected, was the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery</hi> of <hi>Edenburg</hi>: And if we may believe <hi>Calderwood</hi> himself, <note n="(e)" place="margin">Cald. 116.</note> 
                  <hi>That Presbytery</hi> was not erected till the <hi>thirtieth</hi> day of <hi>May</hi> 1581. more time was run before the rest were erected: They were not agreed to by the King till the year 1586. They were not Ratified by Parliament till the year 1592. And now let the Impartial Reader judge if it is probable that our Reformers, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thought on <hi>Presbyteries,</hi> were of the <hi>present Presbyterian principles?</hi> Were they Presbyterians who never understood, never thought of, never <hi>dream'd</hi> of that, which is so <hi>Essential</hi> to the constitution of a Church, by <hi>Divine Institution,</hi> according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Presbyterian principles?</p>
               <p>But doth not <hi>G.

True, he saith so: But no Man but himself ever said so: But I know the <hi>Natural History</hi> of this Ignorant blunder; His Historian <hi>Calderwood</hi> had said that <hi>the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:101025:230"/>
Kirk</hi> of Scotland <hi>ever since the beginning, had four sorts of Assemblies,</hi> 
                  <note n="(f)" place="margin">Cald. 29.</note> and this was enough for <hi>G. R.</hi> For what other could these four sorts of Assemblies be, than <hi>Kirk-Sessions, Presbyteries, Provincial Synods,</hi> and <hi>General Assemblies</hi>? But if he had, with the least degree of any thing like attention read four or five lines further, he might have seen that <hi>Calderwood</hi> himself was far from having the <hi>brow</hi> to assert that <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> were, then, in being: For having said there were four sorts of Assemblies from the beginning, he goes on to particularize them, thus,
<q>
                     <hi>National,</hi> which were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>General Assemblies; Provincial,</hi> which were commonly called by the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Name of <hi>Synods; Weekly Meetings</hi> of Ministers and Readers for interpretation of the Scripture, whereunto <hi>succeeded Presbyteries,</hi> that is, <hi>Meetings of many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters and Elders for the Exercise of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi>; and the <hi>Eldership</hi> of every <hi>Parish,</hi> which others call a <hi>Presbytery.</hi>
                  </q>
In which account, it is evident, that he doth not call these <hi>weekly Meetings</hi> for interpretation of the Scriptures, <hi>Presbyteries</hi>; But says, that <hi>Presbyteries succeeded</hi> to these <hi>weekly Meetings</hi>; and he gives quite different Descriptions of these <hi>weekly Meetings</hi> and <hi>Presbyteries</hi>; making the <hi>weekly Meetings</hi> to have been <hi>of Ministers and Elders for the interpretation of Scripture</hi>; and <hi>Presbyteries</hi> to have been (as they still are) <hi>Meetings of many Ministers and Elders, for the Exercise of Discipline.</hi> 'Tis true, he
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:101025:231"/>
might have, as well, said, that <hi>Presbyteries succeeded</hi> to the <hi>Meeting</hi> of the <hi>Four</hi> Kings against the <hi>Five,</hi> or of the <hi>Five</hi> against the <hi>Four,</hi> mentioned in the 14<hi>th Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Genesis</hi>; For the <hi>Meetings</hi> of these Kings were <hi>before</hi> our <hi>Presbyteries,</hi> I think, in order of time: And these <hi>Meetings</hi> of these Kings were as much like our <hi>present Presbyteries,</hi> as those Meetings were, which were appointed at the Reformation for the inte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But enough of this Author at present; we shall have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occasions of meeting with him.</p>
               <p>This Assembly was also earnest with the King that the <hi>Book of Policy</hi> might be farther considered; and that farther Conference might be had about it; That the Heads, not agreed about, might be compromised, some way or other. <note n="(g)" place="margin">MS.

And now that I have so frequently mentioned this <hi>Second Book of Discipline,</hi> and shall not have occasion to proceed much further in this wearisome Deduction; Before I leave it, I shall only say this much more about it.</p>
               <p>As much stress as the <hi>Presbyterian party</hi> laid on it, afterwards, and continue, still, to lay on it; as if it were so very exact a <hi>Systeme</hi> of Ecclesiastical Polity; yet, at the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:101025:231"/>
beginning, the Compilers of it, had no such Confident sentiments about it; For, if we may believe <hi>Spotswood,</hi> 
                  <note n="(h)" place="margin">Spot. 277.</note> (and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is not contradicted by any Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Historian) when Master <hi>David Lindesay,</hi> Mr. <hi>Iames Lawson</hi> and Mr. <hi>Robert Pont,</hi> were sent by the Assembly to present it to the Regent, <hi>Morton,</hi> in the end of the year 1577, <hi>They intreated his Grace to receive the Articles presented to him, and if any of them did seem not agreeable to reason, to vouchsafe Audience to the Brethren, whom the Assembly had named to attend. Not, that they thought it a work complete, to which nothing might be added, or from which nothing might be diminished; for, as God should reveal further unto them, they should be willing to help and renew the same.</hi> Now, upon this Testimony, I found this Question<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whither the Compilers of the <hi>Second Book of Discipline,</hi> could<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in reason, have been earnest that this <hi>Book,</hi> which they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged not to be a work so complete, as that nothing could be added to it or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from it, should have been confirmed by ane <hi>Oath,</hi> and sworn to, as ane <hi>Vnalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Rule of Policy</hi>? Are they not injurious to them who make them capable of such a <hi>bare faced</hi> absurdity? Indeed whatever our present Presbyterians say, and with how great assurance soever, they talk to this purpose, this is a Demonstration, that the compilers of it, never intended, nay could not <hi>intend,</hi> that it should be <hi>sworn</hi> to in the <hi>Negative Confession.</hi> That it was not <hi>sworn</hi>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:101025:232"/>
to in that <hi>Confession,</hi> I think, I could prove with as much evidence as the nature of the thing is capable of, if it were needful to my present purpose: But not being that, I shall only give this further Demonstration, which comes in here naturally enough, now, that we have mentioned this <hi>Book</hi> so often. The <hi>Negative Confession</hi> was <hi>sworn</hi> to and <hi>subscribed</hi> by the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Council</hi> upon the 28. of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1580/1. <note n="(i)" place="margin">Cald. 96.</note> Upon the <hi>second</hi> of <hi>March</hi> thereafter the King gave out a <hi>Proclamation,</hi> ordering all the subjects to <hi>subscribe</hi> it. <note n="(k)" place="margin">Cald. 97.</note> But the King had never approven, never owned, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, had constantly rejected the <hi>Second Book of Discipline</hi>; Nay it was not <hi>Rati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By necessary consequence, I think, it was not <hi>sworn</hi> to in the <hi>Negative Confession.</hi> And thus I leave it. Proceed we now to the next Assembly.</p>
               <p>It met at <hi>Dundee</hi> upon the <hi>twelfth</hi> of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1580. full <hi>twenty</hi> years after the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; For the Parliament which Established the Reformation, (as the Presbyterian Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians are earnest to have it) had its first Meeting on the <hi>tenth</hi> of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1560. This, this was the Assembly, which, after so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>fencings</hi> and <hi>strugglings,</hi> gave the deadly <hi>Thrust</hi> to <hi>Episcopacy.</hi> I shall transcribe its Act word for word from <hi>Calderwood,</hi> who has exactly enough taken it from the <hi>MS.</hi> and both <hi>Spotswood</hi> and <hi>Petrie</hi> agree, <note n="(l)" place="margin">Cald. 90.

                  <hi>Forasmuch as the Office of a Bishop, as it is now used and commonly taken within this Realm, hath no sure Warrant, Authority nor good Ground out of the Book and Scriptures of God, but is brought in by the Folly and Corruptions of mens invention, to the great overthrow of the true Kirk of God, The whole Assembly, in one voice, after Liberty given to all men to Reason in the matter, none oppening themselves in defence of the said pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Office; Findeth and Declareth the same pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Office, Vsed and Termed as is abovesaid, Vnlawful in the self, as having neither Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Ground nor Warrant in the word of God; And Ordaineth, that all such Persons as brook, or hereafter shall brook the said Office, be charged</hi> simpliciter <hi>to dimit, quite, and leave off, the Samine; as ane Office whereunto they are not called by God; and sicklike to desist and cease from preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Ministration of the Sacraments, or using, any way, the Office of Pastors, while they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</hi> de novo, <hi>Admission from the General Assembly, under the pain of Excommunication to be used against them; Wherein, if they be found Disobedient, or Contraveen this Act in any point, The sentence of Excommunication, after due admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, to be execute against them.</hi> This is the <hi>Act.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Perhaps it were no very great difficulty to impugn the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of this <hi>true blue</hi> Assembly, and to expose the boldness, the folly, the iniquity, the preposterous zeal, which are conspicious in this Act; Nay, yet, after all this, to shew, that the <hi>Zealots</hi> for <hi>Parity</hi> had not arrived at that <hi>height</hi> of <hi>Effrontery,</hi> as to <hi>Condemn</hi> Prelacy, as <hi>simply</hi>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:101025:233"/>
and in it self Unlawful: But, by this time, I think, I have performed my promise, and made it appear that it was no <hi>easy</hi> task to <hi>Abolish</hi> Episcopacy and <hi>Introduce</hi> Presbytery; to turn down Prelacy, and set up Parity in the Government of the Church, when it was first attempted, in <hi>Scotland:</hi> And therefore I shall stop here, and bring this long Disquisition upon the <hi>Second Enquiry</hi> to a Conclusion; after I have Recapitulated and represented in one intire view, what I have at so great length deduced.</p>
               <p>I have made it appear, I think, That no such Article was believed, professed or maintained by the body of any Reformed or Reforming Church, or by any Eminent and Famous Divine in any Reformed or Reforming Church, while our Church was a Reforming; No such <hi>Article,</hi> I say, as that, of the <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>indispensible Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>Parity,</hi> and the <hi>Vnlawfulness</hi> of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy</hi> or <hi>Imparity</hi> amongst the Governours of the Church: I have made it appear that there is no reason to believe that our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers were more <hi>prying</hi> in such matters than the Reformers of other Churches: I have made it appear that there is not so much as a syllable, a shew, a shadow of ane Indication, That any of those who <hi>Merited</hi> the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>our Reformers,</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd any such Principle, or maintain'd any such Article: I have made it appear that our Reformation was carryed on, much, very much, by the <hi>Influences,</hi> and upon the
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:101025:233"/>
                  <hi>principles</hi> of the <hi>English Reformers,</hi> amongst whom that principle of <hi>parity</hi> had no imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable <hi>footing</hi>: These are, at least, great <hi>presumptions</hi> of the Credibility of this, That our Reformers maintain'd no such principle.</p>
               <p>Agreeably to these <hi>presumptions,</hi> I have made it appear that our Reformers proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>de Facto</hi> upon the <hi>principles</hi> of <hi>Imparity:</hi> They formed their <hi>petitions</hi> for the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of our Church, according to these <hi>principles</hi>: The <hi>first Scheme</hi> of Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, they erected, was Established upon these principles: Our <hi>Superintendents,</hi> were notoriously and undeniably <hi>Prelates</hi>: The <hi>next</hi> Establishment, in which the <hi>Prelates</hi> resumed the <hi>old Names</hi> and <hi>Titles</hi> of <hi>Archbishops</hi> and <hi>Bishops,</hi> was the same for substance, with the <hi>first</hi>: At least, they did not <hi>differ</hi> as to the point of <hi>Imparity</hi>: I have made it appear that this <hi>second</hi> Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment was agreed to, by the Church, unanimously, and submitted to calmly and peaceably; and that it was received as ane Establishment which was intended to continue in the Church: At least, no <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections</hi> made against it, no <hi>appearances,</hi> in opposition to it, no <hi>indications</hi> of its being accepted, only for ane <hi>Interim</hi> upon the account of <hi>Imparity</hi>'s being in its constitution: I have made it appear that <hi>Imparity</hi> was received, practised, owned and submitted to, and that <hi>Prelates</hi> were suitably honoured and dutifully obeyed, without reluctancy,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:101025:234"/>
and without interruption, for full <hi>fifteen</hi> years after the Reformation; and I have made it appear, that, after it was called in Question, its Adversaries found many Repulses, and mighty difficulties, and spent much travel, and much time, no less than full <hi>five</hi> years, before they could get it A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished; and if the Deduction I have made puts not this beyond all doubt, it may be further confirmed by the Testimonies of <hi>two</hi> very intelligent Authors; The <hi>first</hi> is that ingenious and judicious Author who wrote the accurate piece, called <hi>Episcopacy not Abjured in Scotland,</hi> published <hi>Anno</hi> 1640. Who affirms positively, <note n="(m)" place="margin">p. 97.</note>
                  <q>That it was by Reason of opposition made to the Presbyterians, by many wise, learned and Godly Brethren, who stood, firmly for the Ancient Discipline of the Church, that Episcopacy was so long a condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</q>
It appears from his Elaborate work that he was ane <hi>ingenuous</hi> as well as ane <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious</hi> Person, and living then, and having been at so much pains to inform himself concerning not only the <hi>Transactions,</hi> but the <hi>Intrigues</hi> of former times, it is to be presumed, he did not affirm such a propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition without sufficient ground: But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>dust</hi> may be raised about his <hi>Credit</hi> and Authority; Sure I am, my other witness is unexceptionable. He is King <hi>Iames</hi> the <hi>Sixth</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the <hi>First</hi> of <hi>England</hi>; This Great and Wise Prince lived in these times in which <hi>Presbytery</hi> was <hi>first</hi> intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced;
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:101025:234"/>
and I think it is scarcely to be Questioned, That he understood, and could give a just account of, what passed, then, as well as any man, then, living; and he in his <hi>Basilion Doron,</hi> 
                  <note n="(n)" place="margin">p. 160<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of his Works printed at <hi>London</hi> 1616.</note> affirms plainly, <hi>That the Learned, Grave and Honest Men of the Ministery, were ever ashamed of, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with, the Temerity and Presumption</hi> of the Democratical and Presbyterian party. All these things, I say, I think, I have made appear sufficiently; and so I am not affraid to leave it to the world to judge, <hi>Whither our Reformers were of the present Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian principles</hi>?</p>
               <p>Only one thing more, before I proceed to the next Enquiry. Our Presbyterian Brethren, <hi>Calderwood, Petrie</hi> and <hi>G. R.</hi> (as I have already observed) are very earnest and careful to have their Readers advert, that when Episcopacy was Established by the <hi>Agreement</hi> at <hi>Leith, Anno</hi> 1572. the <hi>Bishops</hi> were to have no more <hi>Power,</hi> than the <hi>Superintendents</hi> had before; and, indeed it is true, they had no more, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready acknowledged; But I would advise our Brethren to be more Cautious in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting on such a dangerous point, or <hi>Glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> in such a <hi>Discovery,</hi> hereafter; For thus I Argue.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Episcopacy Agreed to</hi> at <hi>Leith, Anno</hi> 1572, as to its <hi>Essentials,</hi> its <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> was the same with the <hi>Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendency</hi> Established at the Reformation, <hi>Anno</hi> 1560. But the General Assembly
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:101025:235"/>
holden at <hi>Dundee, Anno</hi> 1580. <hi>Condemned</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Episcopacy, Agreed to</hi> at <hi>Leith, Anno</hi> 1572. <hi>Ergo</hi> they <hi>condemnd</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Superintendency</hi> Established by our Reformers, <hi>Anno</hi> 1560. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Assembly 1580. not only <hi>forsook,</hi> but <hi>Condemned</hi> the <hi>principles</hi> of <hi>our Reformers:</hi> But if this Reasoning holds; I think our <hi>present Presbyterian</hi> Brethren have no Reason to <hi>Claim</hi> the <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>Successors to our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers:</hi> They must not <hi>ascend</hi> so high as the year 1560, They must <hi>stand</hi> at the year 1580; For, if I mistake not, the Laws of <hi>Heraldry</hi> will not allow them to call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the <hi>True</hi> Posterity of <hi>those</hi> whom <hi>they</hi> Condemn, and <hi>whose</hi> principles <hi>they</hi> Declare Erroneous. In such <hi>Moral Cognations,</hi> I take <hi>Oneness</hi> of <hi>principle</hi> to be the <hi>foundation</hi> of the <hi>Relation,</hi> as <hi>Oneness</hi> of <hi>Blood,</hi> is in <hi>Physical Cognations.</hi> Let them not, therefore, go farther up than the year 1580.

               <p>Considering what hath been Discoursed, so fully on the former <hi>Enquiry,</hi> this may be very soon dispatched: For, If <hi>Prelacy, and the Superiority of other Officers in the Church, above Presbyters,</hi> was so unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously consented to, and Established at the Reformation; If it continued to be Owned, Revered, and Submitted to, by Pastors and People, without interruption, without being ever called in Question for full <hi>fifteen</hi> years after the Reformation; If, after it was <hi>called in Question,</hi> its Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries found it so hard a task to subvert it, that they spent five years more, before they could get it <hi>subverted</hi> and declared <hi>Vnlawful,</hi> even, as it was, then, in <hi>Scotland</hi>; If these things are true, (I say) I think it is not <hi>very Credible,</hi> that it was <hi>a great and insupportable Grievance and trouble to this Nation, and contrary to the Inclinations of the Generality

of the People</hi> EVER <hi>since the Reformation.</hi> This Collection I take to be as clear a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration as the subject is capable of. But beside this, we have the clear and consentient Testimonies of Historians to this purpose.</p>

               </p>
               <p>I might also cite <hi>Beza</hi> himself to this purpose, in his Letter to <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> dated, <hi>Geneva, April</hi> 12. 1572: wherein he Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulates heartily the happy and <hi>Vnited</hi> state of the Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Perhaps it might be no difficult task to adduce more Testimonies: But the truth is, no man can
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:101025:236"/>
Read the Histories and Monuments of these times without being convinced that this is true; and that there cannot be a falser proposition, than, <hi>That Prelacy was such a Grievance, then,</hi> or, so <hi>contrary to the Inclinations of the Generality of the People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Further, even in succeeding times, even after it was Condemnd by that Assembly 1580, it cannot be proven that it was such a <hi>Grievance</hi> to the <hi>Nation.</hi> 'Tis true indeed, some <hi>Hot-headed</hi> Presbyterian Preachers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured, all they could, to possess the <hi>People</hi> with ane opinion of its <hi>Antichristianism,</hi> forsooth, and that it was a <hi>Brat</hi> of the <hi>Whore,</hi> a <hi>Limb</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> and what not? But all this time, no account of the <hi>Inclinations of the Generality of the People</hi> against it. On the contrary, nothing more evident, in History, even <hi>Calderwoods</hi> History, than that there was no such thing. Is it not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viously observable, even in <hi>that</hi> History, that after the Civil Government took some 12 or 14 of the most forward of <hi>these Brethren,</hi> who kept the pretended Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, at <hi>Aberdeen, Anno</hi> 1605 a little <hi>Roundly</hi> to <hi>Task,</hi> and some 6 or 8 more were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the King, to attend his will, at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> all things went very peaceably in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>? Was not Episcopacy restored by the General Assembly at <hi>Glasgow, Anno</hi> 1610, with <hi>very great Unanimity</hi>? Of more than ane <hi>hundred</hi> and <hi>seventy voices,</hi> there were only <hi>five Negative</hi> and <hi>seven, Non liquet.</hi> Nay <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwood</hi> himself hath recorded that even
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:101025:237"/>
these Ministers, who went to <hi>London,</hi> after their return, submitted peaceably to the, then, <hi>Established Prelacy.</hi> And there are few things more observable in his Book, than his <hi>Grudge,</hi> that there should have been such a <hi>General Defection</hi> from the <hi>good Cause.</hi> Indeed I have not observed, no not in his History, that there were <hi>six</hi> in all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, who, from the Establishment of Episcopacy, <hi>Anno</hi> 1610. did not attend, at <hi>Synods,</hi> and submit to their <hi>Ordinaries</hi>; I do not remember any except two, <hi>Calderwood</hi> himself, and one <hi>Iohnston</hi> at <hi>Ancrum</hi>; and even these two pretended other Reasons than <hi>Scruple</hi> of Conscience for their <hi>withdrawing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is further observable that the <hi>Stirs</hi> which were made, after the Assembly, at <hi>Perth, Anno</hi> 1618. were not pretended to be upon the account of <hi>Episcopacy</hi>; Those of the <hi>Gang,</hi> could not prevail, it seems, with the <hi>Generality of the People</hi> to <hi>tumultuate</hi> on that account. All that was pretended were the <hi>Perth Articles:</hi> Neither did the <hi>Humour</hi> against <hi>these Articles</hi> prevail much, or far, all the time King <hi>Iames</hi> lived, nor for the first <hi>twelve</hi> years of King <hi>Charles,</hi> his Son and Successor; It fell <hi>asleep,</hi> as it were, till the <hi>Clamours</hi> against the <hi>Liturgy</hi> and <hi>Book of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, awakened</hi> it <hi>Anno</hi> 1637: And all that time, I mean, from the year 1610, that Episcopacy was restored, till the year 1637, that the <hi>Covenanting work</hi> was set on foot, <hi>Prelacy</hi> was so far from being <hi>a great and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable Grievance and Trouble to this Nation,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:101025:237"/>
and contrary to the Inclinations of the Generality of the People</hi>; that, on the contrary, it was not only Generally submitted to, but, in very good esteem. Indeed, it is certain, the Nation had never more Peace, more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, more plenty, more profound quiet and prosperity, than in that Interval. Let no man reckon of these things as naked As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions: I can prove them; And hereby I undertake (with Gods allowance and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance) to prove all I have said, and more, if I shall be put to it. But I think my cause requires not that it should be done at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. Nay further yet,</p>
               <p>I don't think it were ane insuperable task, if I should undertake to maintain, that, when the <hi>Covenanting Politick</hi> was set on foot, <hi>Anno</hi> 1637. <hi>Prelacy</hi> was no <hi>such Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance</hi> to the Nation. This I am sure of, it was not the Contrariety of the Generality of the Peoples Inclinations to Prelacy that first gave life and motion to that <hi>Monstrous Confederation.</hi> Sure I am, it was pretty far advanced, before the <hi>Leading Confederates</hi> offered to fix on <hi>Prelacy,</hi> as one of their Reasons for it: So very sure, that it is easy to make it appear, that they were affraid of nothing more, than that <hi>the Generality of the People</hi> should <hi>smell</hi> it out, that they had <hi>designs</hi> to <hi>overturn</hi> Episcopacy. How often did they <hi>Protest</hi> to the <hi>Marquis</hi> of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> then, the Kings Commissioner, that their meaning was not to <hi>Abolish</hi> Episcopal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment? <note n="(c)" place="margin">See large De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar. 114, 115.</note> How <hi>frank</hi> were they to
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:101025:238"/>
tell those, whom they were earnest to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jole</hi> into their <hi>Covenant,</hi> that they might very well <hi>swear</hi> it, without prujudice to Episcopacy? <note n="(d)" place="margin">Ibid. 69. &amp; 173.</note> Nay how forward were the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Ministers themselves to <hi>propagate</hi> this <hi>pretence</hi>? When the <hi>Doctors</hi> of <hi>Aberdeen</hi> told the <hi>Three,</hi> who were sent to that <hi>City</hi> to procure subscriptions, that they could not swear the <hi>Covenant</hi> because <hi>Episcopacy</hi> was <hi>abjured</hi> in it. Are not these <hi>Hendersons</hi> and <hi>Dicksons</hi> very words, in their <hi>Answer</hi> to the <hi>fourth Reply, You will have all the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, against their intention, and whither they will or not, to disallow and condemn the Articles of</hi> Perth, <hi>and Episcopal Government; — But it is known, to many hundreds, that the words were purposely conceived, for satisfaction of such as were of your Iugment, that we might all joyn in one Heart and Covenant?</hi> Many more things might be readily adduced to prove this more fully: But 'tis needless, for what can be more fairly colligible from any thing, than it is from this <hi>Specimen,</hi> that it was their <hi>fear,</hi> that they might <hi>miss</hi> of their <hi>mark,</hi> and not get the people to joyn with them, in their <hi>Covenant,</hi> if it should be so soon discovered, that they <hi>aim'd</hi> at the <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw</hi> of <hi>Episcopacy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis true indeed, after they had, by such disingenuous and <hi>Iesuitish Fetches,</hi> gain'd <hi>numbers</hi> to their <hi>party,</hi> and got many well-meaning Ministers and People engaged in their <hi>Rebellious</hi> and <hi>Schismatical Confederacy,</hi> they took off the <hi>Mask</hi>; and condemned
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:101025:238"/>
                  <hi>Episcopacy</hi> in their <hi>pack't Assembly, Anno</hi> 1638; Declaring with more than <hi>Iesuitish impudence,</hi> that, (notwithstanding of their protestations so frequently and publickly made to the contrary) it was <hi>abjured</hi> in their <hi>Covenant.</hi> And yet I dare advance this <hi>Paradox,</hi> that, even then, it was not ane <hi>Insupportable Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance</hi> to the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> themselves, far less to the whole <hi>Nation.</hi> I own this to be a <hi>Paradox,</hi> and therefore I must ask my Readers allowance to give my Reason for which I have dared to advance it. It is this.</p>
               <p>Considering how much Prelacy <hi>affects</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> as a <hi>Society</hi>; Of how great conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence it is in the <hi>Concerns</hi> of the Church; whatever it is in itself, it cannot, in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, be called ane <hi>Insupportable Grievance</hi> to <hi>such</hi> as are <hi>satisfied, they</hi> can live <hi>safely</hi> and without <hi>sin,</hi> in the <hi>Communion</hi> of that <hi>Church,</hi> where it <hi>prevails.</hi> If such can call it a <hi>Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance</hi> at all, I think they cannot justly call it <hi>more</hi> than a <hi>Supportable Grievance:</hi> I think it cannot be justly called ane <hi>Insupportable Grievance,</hi> till it can <hi>Iustify,</hi> and, by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, <hi>Necessitate</hi> a <hi>Separation</hi> from that Church which has <hi>it</hi> in its Constitution. How can that be called ane <hi>Insupportable Grievance,</hi> especially in Church matters, where <hi>Grievance</hi> and <hi>Corruption,</hi> (if I take them right, must be terms very much equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent) to those who can <hi>safely support</hi> it? <hi>i. e. Live</hi> under it <hi>without sin,</hi> and with a <hi>safe Conscience, continue</hi> in the <hi>Churches Communion</hi>
                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:101025:239"/>
while <hi>it</hi> is in the <hi>Churches Government</hi>? How can that be called <hi>insupportable,</hi> which is not of such <hi>Malignity</hi> in a Church as to make <hi>her</hi> Communion sinful? How can that be called <hi>insupportable</hi> in <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> concerns or <hi>Religious</hi> matters, to those who are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded they may <hi>bear</hi> it, or <hi>with</hi> it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out disturbing their <hi>inward Peace,</hi> or endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering their <hi>Eternal Interests</hi>? Now, such, in these times, were all the Presbyterians, at least, Generally, in the Nation; They did not think upon <hi>Breaking</hi> the <hi>Communion</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>; upon <hi>separating</hi> from the <hi>solemn Assemblies</hi> under <hi>Prelacy,</hi> and setting up <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Altars</hi> in opposition to the <hi>Episcopal Altars</hi>: They still kept up <hi>one Communion</hi> in the Nation: They did not refuse to joyn in the <hi>Publick Ordinances,</hi> the <hi>Solemn worship</hi> of God and the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> with their <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latick</hi> Brethren: all this is so well known, that none, I think, will call it in Question. Indeed that <hi>Height</hi> of <hi>Antipathy</hi> to <hi>Prelacy</hi> had not prevailed amongst the party, no not when Episcopacy had its <hi>fetters</hi> struck off, <hi>Anno</hi> 1662. for then, and for some years after, the Presbyterians generally, both Pastors and People kept the <hi>Vnity</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>joyned</hi> with the <hi>Conformists</hi> in the publick Ordinances: And I believe there are hundreds of thousands in <hi>Scotland</hi> who remember very well how short a time it is since they betook themselves to <hi>Conventicles,</hi> and turn'd <hi>avowed Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="285" facs="tcp:101025:239"/>I Confess the reasoning I have just now insisted on cannot militate so patly against such: For if they had reason to <hi>separate,</hi> they had the same Reason to call <hi>Prelacy</hi> ane <hi>insupportable Grievance</hi>; No more and no other: But I cannot see how the <hi>Force</hi> of it can be well avoided by them, in respect of their Predecessors, who had not the <hi>Boldness</hi> to <hi>separate</hi> upon the account of <hi>Prelacy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it may be said that those Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians who lived <hi>Anno</hi> 1637. and downward, <hi>Shook off</hi> Prelacy, and would <hi>bear</hi> it no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and was it not, then, ane <hi>insupportable Grievance</hi> to them? True, indeed, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the <hi>pretended</hi> Corruptions of <hi>Prelacy,</hi> they, then, ventured upon the; <hi>really,</hi> horrid sin of Rebellion against their Prince; they embroyled three Famous and flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Kingdoms; They brake down the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and Ancient Structures of Government both in Church and State; They shed O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceans of Christian blood, and made the Nations welter in gore; They gave up themselves to all the wildnesses of rage and fury; They gloried in Treason and Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in Oppression and Murther, in Fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Unbridled Tyranny; they drench't innumerable miss-led souls, in the Crimson guilt, of Schism and Sedition, of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion and Faction, of Perfidy and Perjury: In short, they opened the way to such ane Inundation of Hypocrisie, and Irreligion, of Confusions, and Calamities, as cannot
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:101025:240"/>
easily be Parallell'd, in History; And for all these things they <hi>pretended</hi> their <hi>Antipathies</hi> to <hi>Prelacy</hi>; and yet, after all this, I am where I was; Considering their aforesaid principles and practices as to the <hi>Vnity</hi> of the Church, they could not call it ane <hi>Insupportable Grievance</hi>; They did not truly <hi>find</hi> it <hi>such</hi>; Had they really and sincerely, in true <hi>Christian simplicity</hi> and sobriety, found or <hi>felt</hi> it such, they would, no doubt, have lookt on it, as a <hi>forcible ground,</hi> for <hi>separating</hi> from the <hi>Communion,</hi> in which it prevailed; as the <hi>Protestants,</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> found their <hi>Centum Gravamina,</hi> for <hi>separating</hi> from the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> To have made it that, indeed, and, then, to have <hi>suffered patiently,</hi> if they had been <hi>persecuted</hi> for it, without turning to the <hi>Antichristian course</hi> of <hi>Armed Resistance,</hi> had had some <hi>colour</hi> of ane Argument that they deem'd it ane <hi>insuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Grievance</hi>; But the <hi>Fiercest fighting</hi> against it, so long as they could allow themselves to <hi>live</hi> in the <hi>Communion</hi> which <hi>own'd</hi> it, can never infer that it was, to them, ane <hi>insupportable Grievance</hi>; at most, if it was, it was, to <hi>wanton humour</hi> and <hi>wildfire,</hi> only, and not to <hi>Conscience,</hi> and real Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian <hi>Conviction.</hi> And so I leave this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>I could easily insist more largely on this Enquiry, but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to avoid tediousness, I shall advance only <hi>one</hi> thing more; It is a <hi>Challenge</hi> to my Presbyterian Brethren, to produce but <hi>one publick deed,</hi> one solemn or conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:101025:240"/>
Appearance of the Nation, taken either <hi>Collectively</hi> or <hi>Representatively,</hi> which by any tolerable construction or interpretation, can import that <hi>Prelacy</hi> or <hi>the superiority of any Office in the Church above Presbyters, was a great and insupportable Grievance and trouble to this Nation, and contrary to the Inclinations of the Generality of the People,</hi> for full <hi>thirty</hi> years after the Reformation.</p>
               <p>The Learned <hi>G. R.</hi> thought he had found one, indeed, it seems, for he introduced it very <hi>briskly,</hi> in his <hi>first Vindication</hi> of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in <hi>Answer</hi> to the <hi>first Question,</hi> §. 9. hear him. <hi>It is Evident</hi> (says he) <hi>that Episcopal Iurisdiction over the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants was condemned by Law, in that same Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> 1567, <hi>wherein the Protestant Religion was Established.</hi> What? No less than E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident! Let us try this Parliamentary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. <hi>It is there Statute and Ordain'd, That no other Iurisdiction Ecclesiastical be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged within this Realm, than that which is, and shall be, within this same Kirk, Established presently, or which floweth therefrom, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Preaching the word, Correcting of manners, administration of Sacraments.</hi> So he: No Man who knows this <hi>Author</hi> and his <hi>way</hi> of writing will readily think it was ill man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to examine whither he cited right; I turn'd over, therefore, all the Acts of that Parliament which are in Print (and I think his citation shall scarcely be found amongst the unprinted ones) but could not find this citation of our Author's. What was next
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:101025:241"/>
to be done? I knew that full well; I turn'd to the 43. <hi>page</hi> of <hi>his Historian, Calderwood,</hi> and there I found it word for word. Well! But is there no such Period to be found in the Acts of that Parliament? Not one, indeed.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, there is ane Act, the <hi>sixth</hi> in number; Intituled, <hi>Anent the true and Holy Kirk, and of them that are declared to be of the same</hi>; which Act I find insisted on by the <hi>Covenanters, Anno</hi> 1638. in their Answer to the <hi>Marquis</hi> of <hi>Hamiltons Declaration,</hi> at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> in <hi>December,</hi> that year, (as is to be seen in the <hi>large Declaration,</hi>) <note n="(e)" place="margin">p. 352.</note> as condemning Episcopacy. 'Tis very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble this might be the Act <hi>Calderwood</hi> thought he abridged in these words, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from him by <hi>G. R.</hi> I shall set it down, word for word, that the world may judge if Episcopacy is Condemned by it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Forasmuch as the Ministers of the blessed Evangel of Iesus Christ, whom God of his mercy hath now raised up amongst us, or hereafter shall raise, Agreeing with them who now live, in Doctrine, and Administration of the Sacraments, (as, in the Reformed Kirks of this Realm, they are publickly Administrate) according to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Faith; Our Soveraign Lord, with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of My Lord Regent, and three Estates of this present Parliament, has declared, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, the aforesaid Persons, to be the only true, and Holy Kirk, of Iesus Christ, within this Realm; And Decerns and Declares, that all
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:101025:241"/>
and sundrie, who, either, gainsay the word of the Evangel, received and approved, as the Heads of the Confession of Faith Professed in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, before, in the year of God</hi> 1560. <hi>years; As also specified in the Acts of this Parliament, more particularly doth express, and now Ratified and approved in this present Parliament; Or that refuses the Participation of the Holy Sacraments, as they are now Ministrate, to be no Members of the said Kirk within this Realm, presently Professed, so long as they keep themselves, so divided, from the Society of Christs Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the <hi>Act:</hi> Now, here, not one word of <hi>Ecclesiastical Iurisdiction,</hi> either <hi>Foreign</hi> or <hi>Domestick</hi>; Not one word of <hi>any Iurisdiction</hi> within this Realm, or in the <hi>Kirk</hi> within this Realm, or that should <hi>ever flow</hi> from the said Kirk; Not one word of <hi>Correcting of Manners</hi>: From which it is evident that, if this was the <hi>Act, Calder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> aim'd at, he gave the world a very <hi>odd</hi> abridgement of it: And <hi>G. R.</hi> should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider things, a little better, and not take them upon trust, to found Arguments on them so Ridiculously.</p>
               <p>But doth not this Act condemn Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? Let the world judge if it doth; what can be more plain, than that all this Act aims at is only to <hi>Define</hi> that Church, which, then, was to have the legal Establshment, and the countenance of the Civil Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? This Church, it <hi>Defines</hi> to be, that Society of Pastors and People which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed the Doctrine of the Evangel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:101025:242"/>
according to the Confession of Faith then Established: 'Tis plain, I say, this is all, that Act aims at: Not one word of <hi>Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi> or <hi>Discipline,</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> or <hi>Polity,</hi> of <hi>Episcopacy</hi> or <hi>Presbytery,</hi> of <hi>Prelacy</hi> or <hi>Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> of <hi>Equality</hi> or <hi>Inequality</hi> amongst the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of the Church: Whatever the <hi>Form</hi> of Government was, then, in the Church, or whatever it might be, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, was all <hi>one</hi> to this Act, so long as <hi>Pastors</hi> (whither Acting in <hi>Parity</hi> or <hi>Imparity</hi>) and <hi>People,</hi> kept by the same <hi>Rule</hi> of Faith, and the same <hi>manner</hi> of administting the Sacraments. What is there here like a <hi>Condemnation</hi> of Episcopal <hi>Iurisdiction</hi>? Is this the way of <hi>Parliamentary Condemnations,</hi> to <hi>Condemn</hi> ane Office, or ane Order, or a Jurisdiction, (call it as you will) without either naming it, or describing it, in terms so circumstantiated as the world might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, by them, that it was mean't? To <hi>Condemn</hi> a thing, especially a thing of so great importance, without so much as repealing any <hi>one,</hi> of many Acts which Established or Ratifyed it, before? Surely, if this Act Condemned Episcopacy, this Parliament happened upon a <hi>New Stile,</hi> a <hi>Singular Stile,</hi> a <hi>Stile</hi> never used <hi>before,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver used <hi>since.</hi> Besides,</p>
               <p>If this was the Act <hi>G. R.</hi> intended, I would earnestly desire him to name but any <hi>one Man,</hi> who lived in these times, and understood <hi>Episcopacy</hi> to have been <hi>Condemned</hi> by this Act. How <hi>blind</hi> was Master <hi>Andrew

Melvil</hi>? How <hi>blind</hi> was all the Presbyterian <hi>Fraternity,</hi> that, all the <hi>five years,</hi> they were <hi>fighting</hi> against <hi>Prelacy,</hi> could never hit on this <hi>Act,</hi> and prove that it ought to be no longer tolerated, seeing it was against ane <hi>Act</hi> of Parliament? Were they so little care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of <hi>Acts</hi> of Parliamant, that they would not have been at pains to cite them for their purpose? Mr. <hi>Andrew Melvil</hi> in his so often mentioned Letter to <hi>Beza,</hi> dated <hi>Novemb.</hi> 13. 1579. writes thus: <hi>We have not ceased, these five years, to fight against Pseudepiscopacy (many of the Nobility resisting us) and to press the severity of Discipline— We have many of the Peers against us: For they allege if Pseudepisco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy be taken away, one of the Estates is pulled down,</hi> &amp;c. Now, how easy had it been for him to have stopt the <hi>mouths</hi> of these <hi>Peers,</hi> by telling them that it was taken away already by this Act of Parliament? What a <hi>dunce</hi> was the <hi>L. Glamis Chancellor of Scotland,</hi> (by consequence, one, obliged by his station, to understand something, I think, of the Laws of the Nation) and all those whom he consulted about the Letter he wrote to the same <hi>Beza,</hi> that neither <hi>he,</hi> nor <hi>they</hi> knew any thing of this Act of Parliament, but told the Gentleman bluntly, that <hi>Episcopacy subsisted by Law;</hi>

And then let him consider if it be probable that Episcopacy was Condemned by this Act of Parliament.</p>
               <p>But <hi>G.

               <argument>
                  <p>Whither Prelacy, and the Superiority of any Office, in the Church, above Presbyters, was a great and insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable Grievance, and Trouble to this Nation, and contrary to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of the Generality of the People, when this Article was Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in the Claim of Right?</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THis Enquiry is about a very recent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact; the subject will not allow of Metaphysical Arguments; It is not old enough to be determined by the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Historians; It cannot be decided by the publick records or <hi>Deeds</hi> of the Nation; For, if I mistake not, there was never
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:101025:245"/>
publick deed, before, founded, mainly, and in express terms, upon the <hi>Inclinations of the Generality of the People</hi>; and I do not think it necessary, by the Laws of Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that I should be bound by the Authority of a <hi>publick deed,</hi> which I make the <hi>main thing in Question.</hi> The Method, therefore, which I shall take for discussing this <hi>Enquiry,</hi> shall be to give a plain Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical narration of the <hi>Rise</hi> and <hi>Progress</hi> of this Controversie, and consider the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made use of, on both sides, leaving it to the Reader to judge whither <hi>side</hi> can pretend to the greater probability. The Controversie as I take it had its <hi>Rise,</hi> thus;</p>
               <p>The <hi>Scottish Presbyterians,</hi> seasonably forewarned of the, then, <hi>P.</hi> of <hi>O.</hi>'s designs to possess himself of the Crowns of <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> against his coming, had adjusted their Methods for advancing their interests, in such a juncture; and getting their beloved <hi>Parity</hi> Established in the Church; They were no sooner assured that he was in successful circumstances, than they resolved on putting their projects in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: The first step was, in ane <hi>hurry</hi> to <hi>raise</hi> the <hi>Rabble,</hi> in the <hi>Western</hi> Counties, against the <hi>Episcopal Clergy,</hi> thereby, to <hi>Confound,</hi> and put, all things, in <hi>Disorder:</hi> The next, it seems, amidst such confusion, to endeavour, by all means, to have them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves elected members for the <hi>Meeting of Estates,</hi> which was to be at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> upon
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:101025:245"/>
the 14<hi>th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> 168<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. In both steps the success answered their wishes; and it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that they got, indeed, the prevailing <hi>sway</hi> in the Meeting: and in <hi>gratitude</hi> to the <hi>Rabble</hi> which had done them so surprizing service, they resolved not only to set up <hi>Presbytery,</hi> but to set it up on this <hi>foot, That Prelacy was a great and insupportable Grievance and Trouble to the Nation, and contrary to the Inclinations of the Generality of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If this was not, <hi>it,</hi> that determined them to <hi>set up</hi> their Government on this <hi>foot</hi>; I protest I cannot conjecture what it might be, that did it. Sure I am, there was no other thing done, then, that, with the least shew of probability could be called ane <hi>Indication</hi> of the <hi>Inclinations of the People.</hi> They could not collect it from any clamours made, at that time, against Prelacy, by the <hi>Generality of the People</hi>; There were no such clamours in the mouths of the <hi>twentieth part</hi> of the <hi>People.</hi> They could not collect it from the <hi>Peoples separation</hi> from the Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Clergy, during the time of <hi>K. I.</hi>'s <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration</hi>; The <hi>tenth part</hi> of the <hi>Nation</hi> had not <hi>separated.</hi> They could not collect it, from any <hi>Covetous disposition,</hi> they could reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly imagine, was, in <hi>the Generality of the People,</hi> to make themselves <hi>Rich</hi> by possessing themselves of the <hi>Revenues</hi> of <hi>Bishopricks</hi>; They could not but know that 6 or 7000 <hi>l. ster.</hi> was a sorry morsel for so many ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites; and they could not but know,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:101025:246"/>
that when <hi>Prelacy</hi> should be abolished, <hi>few,</hi> and but a <hi>very few,</hi> could find advantage that way. They could not collect it from any suspicions, <hi>the People</hi> could possibly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain that the <hi>Bishops</hi> or the <hi>Episcopal Clergy</hi> were inclining to turn <hi>Papists</hi>; They could not but know that <hi>such</hi> had very far <hi>outdone</hi> the <hi>Presbyterian Preachers</hi> in their appearances against <hi>Popery.</hi> The <hi>Members</hi> of that <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Estates</hi> had received no instructions from their <hi>Respective Electors,</hi> either in <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> or <hi>Burghs</hi> to <hi>turn down</hi> Prelacy and <hi>set up</hi> Presbytery; I could name more than <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two,</hi> who, if they did not <hi>break</hi> their <hi>trust,</hi> did, at least, very much <hi>disappoint</hi> their <hi>Electors,</hi> by doing so. There were no <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions,</hi> no <hi>Addresses</hi> presented to the <hi>Meeting,</hi> by <hi>the People,</hi> craving the <hi>Eversion</hi> of Prelacy, or the <hi>Erection</hi> of Presbytery. They never so much as once offered at <hi>Polling</hi> the <hi>People</hi> about it. Shall I add further? After it was done, they never received <hi>thanks</hi> from the <hi>Generality of the People,</hi> for doing it. There was never yet any thing like ane <hi>Vniversal Rejoycing</hi> amongst <hi>the People,</hi> that it was done. They durst never yet adventure to require from <hi>the Generality of the People,</hi> their <hi>Approbation</hi> of it. And now,</p>
               <p>If the Article was thus Established, at first, <hi>intirely</hi> upon the <hi>foot</hi> of <hi>Rabbling</hi> the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal Clergy</hi> in the <hi>West,</hi> I think I might reasonably superceed all further labour about this Controversie; For, not to mention that they were but the <hi>Rascally scum</hi> of these
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:101025:246"/>
                  <hi>Counties,</hi> where the <hi>Rabbling</hi> was, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd it; and that even in these <hi>Counties</hi> there are great numbers of <hi>People,</hi> who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reckoned <hi>Prelacy a great and insupportable Grievance and Trouble</hi>; but lived, and could have, <hi>still,</hi> lived, peaceably, and contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under it, particularly the most part of the Gentry. Not to insist on these things, I say, but granting that all <hi>the People</hi> in these <hi>Counties</hi> had been inclined, as is affirmed in the Article; yet, what were <hi>they</hi> to the <hi>whole</hi> Nation? Is it reasonable to judge of a <hi>whole Kingdom</hi> by a <hi>corner</hi> of it? To call <hi>these</hi> the sentiments of <hi>all</hi> the Kingdom, which were only the sentiments of <hi>four</hi> or <hi>five</hi> Counties? But lest I have mistaken, in fixing on the Performances of the <hi>Western Rabble,</hi> as the <hi>true foot</hi> of this part of the Article; I shall proceed further, as I promised.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Article</hi> (however founded) thus fram'd and published, surprized the <hi>Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the People</hi>; It was thought very <hi>odd,</hi> not only that <hi>Prelacy</hi> should have been <hi>Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished</hi> upon such <hi>weak</hi> Reasons; But that <hi>the Inclinations of the Generality of the People</hi> should have been pretended, at all, against it; Considering how sensible, <hi>all People</hi> were, that they had never been, so much as <hi>once,</hi> asked how they stood <hi>inclined</hi> in the matter. It came, therefore, to be very much the subject of common discourse, if it really <hi>was so</hi>? And many, who pretended to know the Nation, pretty well, were very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:101025:247"/>
it <hi>was not so</hi>: And began to admire the wisdom of the <hi>Meeting of Estates,</hi> that they should have asserted a proposition, so <hi>very Positively,</hi> which was so <hi>very Questiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> In short, the noise turn'd so great about it, that it could not be confined within the Kingdom, but it passed the <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and spread it self in <hi>England,</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly at <hi>London.</hi> This being perceived, one of the <hi>Presbyterian Agents,</hi> there, (I know not who he was) fell presently on writing a <hi>Book,</hi> which he Entituled <hi>Plain Dealing,</hi> or, <hi>A Moderate General Review of the Scottish Prelatical Clergy's, Proceedings in the Latter Reigns.</hi> Which was published in <hi>August,</hi> I think, or <hi>September</hi> 1689; wherein, having said what he pleased, sense or nonsense, truth or falshood, as he found it most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, for coming at his Conclusion, toward the end he gave his Arguments for his side of our present Controversie. They were these two: Take them in his own words.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There being</hi> 32 <hi>Shires or Counties, and two Stewartries (comprehending the whole body of the Nation) that send their Commissioners or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatives to Parliaments, and all General Meetings of the Estates or Conventions: Of these</hi> 34 <hi>Districts or Divisions of the Kingdom, there are</hi> 17 <hi>intirely Presbyterians; So that where you will find one, there, Episcopally inclined, you'll find</hi> 150 <hi>Presbyterians: And the other</hi> 17 <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions, where there is one Episcopally inclined, there are two Presbyterians.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I am not at leisure to take so much <hi>impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent trash</hi> to <hi>task:</hi> Only, he himself, if he knew any thing of <hi>Scotland,</hi> could not but know that, with the same <hi>Moderation,</hi> he might have asserted that all <hi>Scottish Men</hi> were <hi>Monsters,</hi> and all <hi>Scottish Women,</hi> at every <hi>Birth</hi> produced <hi>Soutrikins</hi>: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as he had the <hi>hap</hi> to <hi>stumble</hi> on two such Demonstrations, so I believe, to this minute, he may have the <hi>happiness</hi> to <hi>claim</hi> them as his <hi>property</hi>; For I have never heard that any other of his Party (no not G. <hi>R.</hi> himself) had the <hi>hardiness</hi> to use them after him. However, so far as I have learned, He was the <hi>first Author,</hi> who published any thing about this Controversie.</p>

<q>That the Nobility of the Kingdom (a very few, not above a dozen excepted) had all sworn the <hi>Oath</hi> commonly called the <hi>Test,</hi> wherein all <hi>Fanatical</hi> principles, and <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Obligations,</hi> were renounced and abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; That not <hi>one</hi> of 40 of the <hi>Gentry</hi> but had <hi>sworn</hi> it also; And not 50 in all <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (out of the <hi>West</hi>) did, upon the <hi>Indulgence</hi> (granted by <hi>King Iames, Anno</hi> 1687.) forsake their Parish Churches to frequent Meeting-houses; That the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality</hi> of the <hi>Commons</hi> live in <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat Towns</hi>; That all who could be of the <hi>Common Council</hi> in such <hi>Corporations,</hi> or were able to follow any <hi>ingenious trade,</hi> were obliged to take the <hi>Test</hi> (and had generally done it) That the <hi>Clergy</hi> stood all for <hi>Episcopacy</hi>; There being of about a <hi>thousand,</hi> scarcely <hi>twenty Trimmers</hi> betwixt the <hi>Bishop</hi> and the <hi>Presbyterian Moderator</hi>; which <hi>twenty</hi> together, with all the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Preachers,</hi> could not make up the <hi>fifth</hi> part of such a number as the other side amounted to: That in all the <hi>Vniversities,</hi> there were not <hi>four Masters, Heads</hi> or <hi>Fellows, inclined</hi> to Presbytery: That the <hi>Colleges</hi> of <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>Physick,</hi> at <hi>Edenburgh</hi> were so averse from it, that the <hi>Generality</hi>

of them were ready, last Summer (<hi>viz.</hi> 1689) to take Arms in defence of their Episcopal Ministers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
This <hi>Book</hi> was published, I think, in the beginning of the year 1690.</p>
               <p>What greater Demonstration could any Man desire of the <hi>truth</hi> of the <hi>Negative,</hi> if all here alleged was <hi>true?</hi> And what greater Argument, of the <hi>truth</hi> of every <hi>one,</hi> of the <hi>Allegations,</hi> than the Confession of a right uncourteous Adversary? <hi>G. R.</hi> I mean, who in Answer to this <hi>Book</hi> wrote his <hi>first Vindication of the Church of Scotland,</hi> as it is now by Law Established, as he calls it; Published at <hi>London,</hi> about the end of the year 1690, and Reprinted at <hi>Edenburgh</hi> in the beginning of 1691. But did he indeed acknowledge the <hi>truth</hi> of all the <hi>Allegations?</hi> Yes, he did it Notoriously.</p>
               <p>He yielded to his Adversary <hi>all the gang if the Clergy except a few; The Vniversities, and the College of Iustice,</hi> at least, <hi>as lately stated</hi>: He was not so <hi>frank</hi> to part with the <hi>Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> indeed, because, if we may take his word for it, <hi>There are not a few worthy Men of that Faculty who are far from Inclinations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Prelacy</hi>: But he durst not say, it seems, that either the <hi>major part</hi> or any thing near the <hi>half</hi> was for him. He also yielded the <hi>Generlity</hi> of the <hi>Burgesses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All the <hi>dust,</hi> he raised, was about the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi>: But what <hi>nasty dust</hi> it was, let any sensible man consider: As for the Nobility, he granted there were only,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:101025:249"/>
                  <hi>a few who took not the Test:</hi> But then, he had <hi>three things</hi> to say, for them who took it. 1. <hi>They who took the Oaths, did not, by that, shew their inclination so much, as what they thought fit to comply with rather than suffer:</hi> But what were they to <hi>suffer</hi> if they took not the <hi>Oaths</hi>? The <hi>loss</hi> of their <hi>vote</hi> in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a <hi>small fine,</hi> which was seldom, if at any time, exacted: But if they were to <hi>suffer</hi> no more, could their <hi>Fears</hi> of such <hi>sufferings, force</hi> them to take <hi>Oaths</hi> so <hi>contrary to their inclinations</hi>? Abstracting from the <hi>impiety</hi> of mocking God, and the <hi>wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness</hi> of <hi>crossing</hi> ones <hi>light,</hi> which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous, in <hi>swearing</hi> against mens perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, could such <hi>sufferings</hi> as these <hi>incline</hi> any man to <hi>swear</hi> to support ane interest which he lookt on as <hi>so great and insupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Grievance and Trouble to the Nation</hi>? But this is not all, for he added: 2. <hi>How many of these, now, when there is no force on them, shew, that it was not choice but</hi> necessity <hi>that led them that way</hi>? I know he meant, that many of these <hi>Nobles</hi> have now broken through these <hi>Oaths:</hi> Let them Answer for that: But what had he to do, in this case, with his old friend <hi>Necessity</hi>? What <hi>Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> can <hi>force</hi> a man to do ane <hi>ill</hi> thing? Besides, can he prove that it was <hi>Choice,</hi> and not that same kind of <hi>Necessity,</hi> that led them in <hi>the way</hi> they have lately followed? That men can be for this thing to day, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to morrow, is a great presumption that they do not much regard either; But
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:101025:249"/>
I think it will be a little hard to draw from it, that they look upon the <hi>one</hi> as a <hi>great and insupportable Grievance</hi> more than the <hi>other.</hi> But the best follows; 3. <hi>Many who seem to make Conscience of these Bonds, yet shew no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to the thing they are bound to, except by the constraint that they brought themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi> After this, what may not our Author make ane Argument, that <hi>Prelacy</hi> is such ane <hi>ill-lik't</hi> thing, as he would have it? See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he has got even them to <hi>hate</hi> it, who are Conscientiously <hi>for it</hi>?</p>
               <p>Neither is he less pleasant about the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi>; He acknowledges, they, as generally, took the <hi>Test</hi>; which was enough for his Adversary, as hath appeared. But how treats he the other Topick, about their not going to the Presbyterian Meetings, when they had King <hi>Iames</hi> his <hi>Toleration</hi> for it? Why? <hi>A silly Argument!</hi> Why so? <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny did go</hi>; But did his Adversary <hi>lie grossely</hi> or <hi>calumniate,</hi> when he said, that not 50 <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen</hi> in all the Kingdom (out of the <hi>West</hi>) forsook their Parish Churches and went to Conventicles? Our <hi>Vindicator</hi> durst not say he did; And has he not made it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that it was a <hi>silly Argument?</hi> But, <hi>Most other clave to the former way</hi> (he means the Episcopal Communion,) <hi>Because the Law stood for it, and the Meeting-houses seem'd to be of uncertain continuance.</hi> But would they have <hi>cleaved</hi> to the former <hi>way</hi> if they had thought it a <hi>great and insupportable Grievance and Trouble</hi>? Would they have so <hi>crossed</hi> their
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:101025:250"/>
                  <hi>Inclinations,</hi> as to have Adhered to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Episcopal Church, when it was evident the sting was taken out of the Law, and it was not to be put in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Were they so <hi>fond</hi> or so <hi>affraid</hi> of a <hi>lifeless</hi> Law (if I may so call it) that they would needs conform to it, tho' they had no <hi>inclination</hi> for such conformity? Tho' what they conform'd with, in obedience to that Law, was a <hi>great and insupportable Grievance</hi> to them? Did our Author and his Party reckon upon these Gentlemen, then, as Presbyterians? And what tho' <hi>the Meetings seem'd to be of uncertain continuance</hi>? How many of the <hi>Presbyterian Party</hi> said, in those days, that they thought themselves bound to take the <hi>Benefit</hi> of the <hi>Toleration,</hi> tho' it should be but of <hi>short continuance</hi>? And that they could return to the Church, when it should be retracted? Might not all men have said and done so, if they had been as much Presbyterians? 'Tis true our Author has some other things on this subject in that first Vindication: But I shall consider them afterwards. This was <hi>G. R.</hi>'s first <hi>Essay</hi> on this Controversie.</p>
               <p>Another <hi>Parity man</hi> finding, belike, that neither the <hi>Plain Dealer</hi> nor the <hi>Vindicator</hi> had gained much credit by their perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, thought it not inconvenient for the <hi>service</hi> of his <hi>Sect</hi> to publish a Book, Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>A further Vindication of the present Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church of Scotland</hi>; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to produce his Arguments for Determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:101025:250"/>
this Controversie: It was Printed in <hi>September,</hi> I think, in the year 1691. 'Tis true he wrote something like a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> and spake discreetly of the <hi>Episcopal Clergy</hi>; He had no <hi>scolding</hi> in his Book, and was infinitely far from <hi>G. R.</hi>'s flat <hi>Railwifery:</hi> And I think my self obliged to thank him for his civility. But after all this, when he came to his Arguments for proving the point about the <hi>Inclinations of the People,</hi> I did not think that he much <hi>helped</hi> the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. They were these two, <note n="(a)" place="margin">p. 32.</note>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. <hi>Tho' the Bishops were introduced in the year</hi> 1662 <hi>and did continue till the year</hi> 1689. <hi>During which time, the far greatest part of all the Ministery in</hi> Scotland <hi>was brought in, by themselves, and tho' they had obtained a Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Synod formed for their own interest, yet they durst never adventure to call it together, so diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent were they even of these Ministers. And can there be a greater Demonstration</hi> (says he) <hi>of the General inclination of this Nation against Prelacy?</hi> But who sees not how many things are wanting, here, to make a <hi>proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Argument,</hi> much more, <hi>a Demonstration</hi>? For who knows not that it was not in the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Bishops,</hi> but of the <hi>King,</hi> to <hi>Convocate</hi> a <hi>National Synod?</hi> And who knows not, that <hi>Presbyterian National Synods,</hi> had committed such <hi>extravagances,</hi> as might have tempted any <hi>King,</hi> almost, to have little <hi>kindness</hi> for <hi>National Synods?</hi> Again, supposing the <hi>Bishops</hi> might have <hi>obtain'd</hi> one, if they had been for it, but would not ask
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:101025:251"/>
it, was there no other imaginable Reason for their forbearing to <hi>ask one,</hi> but their <hi>Diffidence</hi> of the <hi>Ministers</hi>? One living 24 or 28 years agone might possibly have <hi>slipt</hi> into such a <hi>mistake</hi>; But for <hi>one</hi> who wrote only in the year 1691, after it was <hi>visible,</hi> nay <hi>signally remarkable,</hi> that of near to a <hi>thousand Presbyters,</hi> not above <hi>twenty</hi> had fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from the <hi>Episcopal principles</hi>; But all had so generally continued <hi>to Profess</hi> them, and not only so, but to <hi>Profess</hi> them amidst so <hi>many discouragements,</hi> to <hi>Profess</hi> them and <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi> for them; After this. I say, for any man to <hi>found</hi> a <hi>Demonstration</hi> for proving that <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy is contrary to the inclinations of the People,</hi> on the <hi>Bishops averseness</hi> to a <hi>National Synod</hi>; and to <hi>found</hi> that <hi>averseness,</hi> on the <hi>diffidence</hi> they had of the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> as if they had <hi>dreaded,</hi> or had <hi>ground</hi> to <hi>dread</hi> that the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi> would have <hi>subverted</hi> their <hi>order</hi> if they had got a <hi>National Synod,</hi> seems to me a very singular undertaking. Sure I am, if there is any <hi>Demonstration</hi> here at all, it is that there was no great <hi>store</hi> of Demonstrations to be had for our Authors <hi>main Conclusion.</hi> Neither was his other Argument any stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, which is this;</item>
                     <item>2. <hi>This National aversion is yet further De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated from this, that albeit Prelacy had all the Statutes that the Bishops could desire on their behalf, and had them put in Execution with the outmost severity, yet there was ever found a necessity to keep up a standing Army to uphold them, and to suppress the Aversion of the People;
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:101025:251"/>
And notwithstanding thereof there were frequent Insurrections and Rebellions.</hi> Now who sees not the <hi>weakness</hi> of this <hi>Demonstration?</hi> For who knows not that a small part of a Nation by their notorious <hi>Vngovernableness,</hi> and their habitual <hi>Propensities</hi> to <hi>Rebel,</hi> may oblige the Government to keep up a <hi>little standing Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> such as ours in <hi>Scotland</hi> was, for suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them, if, at any time, they should <hi>break out</hi> into a <hi>Rebellion?</hi> The party, I think, can have but little credit from such <hi>Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi> For this <hi>Demonstration</hi> must either sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that <hi>none</hi> in the <hi>Nation</hi> are apt to <hi>Rebel,</hi> except <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and <hi>they,</hi> too, only upon the head of <hi>Church Government</hi>; Or it can conclude nothing: For if <hi>Presbyterians</hi> can <hi>Rebel</hi> upon <hi>other Reasons,</hi> tho' they make this the main, the specious, the clamourous <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text,</hi> as, I doubt not, their <hi>Democratical principles</hi> may <hi>incline</hi> them to do, upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion; Or, if <hi>others</hi> than <hi>sincere</hi> Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians can venture on the <hi>horrid sin</hi> of <hi>Rebellion,</hi> there is still Reason for the <hi>standing Army.</hi> Besides, what <hi>gain'd</hi> they by these their <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Insurrections and Rebellions</hi>? Were they not easily and readily <hi>crush't</hi> by the <hi>rest</hi> of the <hi>Nation</hi>? But if so, I think, if there is any Argument here at all, it concludes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way than our Author design'd it. But it is not worth the while to insist longer on this Argument. Only,</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>If it is a good one, the Bishops and their Adherents have Reason to thank our Author for shewing them the way, how
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:101025:252"/>
they may have their Government restored; For by this way of reasoning they have no more to do but fall upon the <hi>Knack</hi> of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing <hi>frequent Insurrections and Rebellions,</hi> against the present Government; And then their work is done: For thus a <hi>Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> shall <hi>befriend</hi> them; this, when there is a <hi>necessity</hi> of keeping up a <hi>standing Army</hi> to <hi>support</hi> Presbytery, because of <hi>frequent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrections and Rebellions,</hi> raised on its ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; It is a <hi>Demonstration</hi> that it is <hi>a great and insupportable Grievance and Trouble to the Nation, and contrary to the inclinations of the Generality of the People, and therefore it ought to be Abolished.</hi> The truth is, such <hi>reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> are not only <hi>Sophistical,</hi> but <hi>dangerous</hi>; They are founded upon the <hi>principles</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion; and they <hi>tend</hi> directly and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally <hi>towards</hi> Rebellion; And they ought to be noticed by every wise Government: And so I leave this Author.</p>
               <p>The next <hi>Paper-combat</hi> I shall take notice of, was between the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>third Letter</hi> in the <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> called <hi>ane Account of the present Persecution of the Church in</hi> Scotland, &amp;c. published <hi>Anno</hi> 1690. And <hi>G. R.</hi> in his <hi>Second Vindication</hi> published towards the end of the year 1691.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Epistler,</hi> as <hi>G. R.</hi> is sometimes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to call him, had craved a <hi>Poll,</hi> deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, it seems, the only proper method for coming at a sure account of the <hi>inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the generality of the People</hi>; and I think he had Reason: For if matters must go by
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:101025:252"/>
the <hi>inclinations of the People,</hi> it is <hi>just</hi> to <hi>ask</hi> the <hi>People</hi> about their <hi>inclinations.</hi> But would <hi>G. R.</hi> allow him this Demand, which had so much of plain equity in it? No, <hi>His talk</hi> (says he) <hi>of putting the Matter to the poll I neglect as ane impracticable fancy.</hi> 
                  <note n="(b)" place="margin">2<hi>d.</hi> Vind. ad Lett. 3. §. 5.</note> But who sees not that this was plain <hi>Fear</hi> to put it upon such ane <hi>Issue</hi>; What imaginable impossibility, or absurdity, or difficulty, or inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy could make <hi>polling,</hi> upon this account, <hi>Impracticable?</hi> Was it not found <hi>practicable enough,</hi> in the <hi>days</hi> of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> when the <hi>veriest child,</hi> if he could <hi>write</hi> his own <hi>Name,</hi> was put to it to <hi>subscribe</hi> it? What should make it more <hi>impracticable</hi> to <hi>poll</hi> the Kingdom, for finding the <hi>Peoples inclinations,</hi> about <hi>Episcopacy</hi> and <hi>Presbytery,</hi> than it was to <hi>levy Hearth-money</hi> from the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? Is it not as <hi>practicable</hi> to <hi>poll</hi> the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom about <hi>Church Government,</hi> as to <hi>poll</hi> it, for raising the <hi>present subsidy,</hi> which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by <hi>poll?</hi> I am apt to believe, <hi>the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Generality of the People</hi> would have been as much <hi>satisfied,</hi> if <hi>polling</hi> had been redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to practice on the <hi>one</hi> account, as the <hi>other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That same <hi>Epistler,</hi> in that same <hi>Epistle,</hi> adduced another Argument which was to this purpose:
<q>That in the years 1687 and 1688, when the <hi>Schism</hi> was in its <hi>Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> there were but some <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four</hi> Presbyterian <hi>Meeting-houses</hi> erected on the <hi>North</hi> side of the <hi>Tay, i. e.</hi> in the greater half of the Kingdom; And these too, very little frequented or encouraged; and
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:101025:253"/>
that on the <hi>South</hi> side of that <hi>River</hi> (except in the <hi>five Associated Shires</hi> in the <hi>West</hi>) the <hi>third</hi> man was never engaged in the <hi>Schism.</hi>
                  </q>
This was Matter of <hi>Fact:</hi> And if true, a solid Demonstration that <hi>Prelacy and the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority of any Office in the Church, above Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters was not, then, a great and insupportable Grievance and Trouble to the Nation, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the inclinations of the generality of the People:</hi> For had it been such, how is it imaginable when there was such ane <hi>Ample</hi> Toleration, such ane <hi>Absolute</hi> and <hi>Vnperplex't</hi> Liberty, nay so much <hi>notorius</hi> encouragement given by the, then, Government to <hi>separate</hi> from the <hi>Episcopal Communion,</hi> that so <hi>few</hi> should have done it? Whoso pleased might, then, have, safely, and without the least prospect of worldly hazard, joyn'd the Presbyterians: yet scarcely a <hi>fifth</hi> or a <hi>sixth</hi> part of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did it. I am not sure that the nature of the thing was capable of a clearer evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, unless it had been put to <hi>the impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Fancy.</hi> Let us next consider <hi>G. R.</hi>'s An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, and judge, by them, if the <hi>Epistler</hi> was wrong as to the <hi>matter of Fact.</hi> He hath some two or three: we shall try them severally.</p>
               <p>The <hi>First,</hi> to the purpose, is, <hi>If there be many in the Northern parts, who are not for Presbytery, there are as few for the present settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the State.</hi> To what purpose is the present <hi>settlement</hi> of the <hi>State</hi> forced in here? Was the Controversie between him and his Adversary concerned in it, in the least? What impertinent Answering is this? Is
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:101025:253"/>
there so much as <hi>one syllable</hi> here that <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts</hi> the <hi>Epistlers position</hi>? But</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>We affirm</hi> (says <hi>G. R.</hi>) <hi>and can make it appear not only that there are many in the North, who appeared zealously for Presbytery, as was evident by the Members of Parliament, who came from these parts: Very few of them were otherwise inclined, and they made a great figure in the Parliament for settling both the State and the Church.</hi> If one were put to it to examine this Answer particularly and minutely, I think he might easily make even <hi>G. R.</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <hi>wish</hi> that he had never meddled with it: It were no hard task to give a just account how it only <hi>happened</hi> that there was so much as <hi>one Northern</hi> member (who was not such by <hi>birth</hi>) of the <hi>Presbyterian perswasion,</hi> in the <hi>Meeting</hi> of <hi>Estates</hi>: It were as easy to represent what <hi>Figures</hi> some of them <hi>made,</hi> or can readily <hi>make, Vncouth Figures,</hi> truly: All this were very easy, I say, if one were put to it: But as it is not seasonable, so it is not needful: For 'tis plain, nothing, here, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts the <hi>Epistlers</hi> position: Tho' the <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern</hi> members, of the Presbyterian perswasion, had been <hi>twice</hi> as many as they were, and tho' they had made <hi>greater figures</hi> than can be pretended; yet, it may be very <hi>true</hi> that there were so few, <hi>separatists</hi> in the <hi>Northern</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as the <hi>Epistler</hi> affirmed there were. And for the respect <hi>G. R.</hi> owes to his <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Friends</hi> and <hi>Figure-makers,</hi> I would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise him never again to insist on such a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der point; And so I leave it, and proceed to what follows.</p>

                  <pb n="314" facs="tcp:101025:254"/>3. <hi>There are very many Ministers in the North (and People that own them) who, tho' they served under Episcopacy, are willing to joyn with the Presbyterians, and whom the Presbyterians are ready to receive when occasion shall be given, and those of the best Qualified among them.</hi> How such Ministers as have joyn'd, or are ready to joyn with the Presbyterians, can be called the best Qualified amongst the Episcopal Clergy, so long as <hi>integrity</hi> of life, <hi>constancy</hi> in <hi>adhering</hi> to true <hi>Catholick Principles,</hi> ane hearty <hi>abhorrence</hi> of <hi>Schism, Conscience</hi> of the <hi>Religion</hi> of <hi>Oaths, Self-denyal,</hi> taking up the <hi>Cross</hi> patiently and chearfully, and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Christian Honour</hi> and innocence to <hi>worldly conveniences,</hi> can be said to be amongst the <hi>best</hi> Qualifications of a Christian Minister, I cannot understand. I understand as little what ground our Author had, for talking so confidently about these <hi>Northern</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters: Sure I am, he had no sure ground to say so; And I think the transactions of the last General Assembly, and the unsuccess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of Mr. <hi>Meldrum</hi>'s Expedition to the <hi>North,</hi> this Summer, are Demonstrations that he had no ground at all to say so; But whatever be of these things, I desire the Reader to consider, impartially, whither (supposing all were uncontroverted truth, our Author asserts so confidently, here,) this Answer convells the Matter of <hi>Fact</hi> asserted by the Author of the <hi>Letter</hi>? What is there here that looks like proving that the <hi>Schism</hi> was greater in the <hi>North,</hi> than was
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:101025:254"/>
asserted by the <hi>Epistler?</hi> Or what is there here that can by any <hi>colour</hi> of consequence infer that Prelacy in these <hi>Northern</hi> parts was a <hi>great and insupportable Trouble and Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, and contrary to the Inclinations of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the People</hi>? Doth not our Author acknowledge that these Ministers served under <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> and that their <hi>People</hi> own'd them, without any <hi>Reluctancies</hi> of <hi>Conscience</hi>?</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Epistler</hi> had said <hi>there were not above</hi> 3 <hi>or</hi> 4 <hi>Presbyterian Meeting-houses on the North side of the Tay,</hi> and the Vindicator says <hi>they far exceeded that number.</hi> How easy had it been for the <hi>Vindicator</hi> to have given us the <hi>Definite</hi> number of Presbyterian <hi>Meeting-houses,</hi> in these parts, during the time of the above-mentioned <hi>Toleration</hi>? He who was so very exact to have his informations from all corners, might, one would think, have readily satisfied himself in this instance, and fairly fixt one <hi>lie</hi> on the <hi>Epistler</hi>: And is it not a great presumption that the <hi>Epist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> was in the <hi>Right,</hi> and that the <hi>Vindicator,</hi> who was so anxious to have all his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries <hi>Liers,</hi> was hardly put to it in this Matter? When he could do no more than oppose ane <hi>Indefinite</hi> number to the <hi>Epistlers Definite one</hi>? For my part I think it not worth the while to be positive about the <hi>precise</hi> number; But I can say this without Hesitation, that all who <hi>separated</hi> from their Parish Churches, on that side the <hi>River,</hi> would not have filled <hi>four</hi> ordinary <hi>Meeting-houses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="316" facs="tcp:101025:255"/>From what hath been said, I think 'tis clear, the <hi>Epistler</hi> was honest enough in his reckoning for the <hi>North</hi> side of the <hi>Tay.</hi> Can all be made as safe on the <hi>South</hi> side? The <hi>Epistler</hi> had said, that (except in the <hi>West</hi>) <hi>the third Man was never engaged in the Schism</hi>: G. R. Answers, <hi>We know no Schism but what was made by his party: But that the plurality did not suffer under the horrid persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion raised by the Bishops, Doth not prove that they were not inclined to Presbytery; But either that many Presbyterians had freedom to hear Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Ministers, or that all were not resolute enough to suffer for their principle; So that this is no Rational way of judging of the Peoples inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> I will neither engage, at present, with him, in the Question, who is the <hi>Scottish Schismatick</hi>? Nor digress to the point of the <hi>horrid Persecution</hi> raised by the Bishops: Another occasion may be as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for them: But I desire the Reader again, to consider this Answer, and judge, if it keeps not a pretty good distance from the <hi>Epistlers position?</hi> Is any thing said, here, that contradicts, that looks like contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Matter of <hi>Fact</hi>? What new fashion of Answering, is this, to talk whatever comes in ones head, without ever offering to attack the strength of the reasoning he undertakes to discuss?</p>
               <p>By this Taste the judicious Reader may competently judge which is the right side of the present Controversie; and withal, if I mistake not, he may guess if the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an

                  <hi>Kirk</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> was not well provided when it got <hi>G. R.</hi> for its <hi>Vindicator.</hi> Shall he furnish thee, <hi>O patient Reader,</hi> with any more divertisement; If thou canst <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise</hi> for thy <hi>patience</hi> I can <hi>promise</hi> for <hi>G. R.</hi>

               <p>This Learned Gentleman found himself to puzzled, it seems, about this part of the Article, that he was forced to put on the <hi>Fools-cap,</hi> and turn <hi>Ridiculous</hi> to mankind: However, it was even better to be that than to yeild in so weighty a Controversie; than to part with the <hi>Inclinations of the People,</hi> that <hi>Articulus Stantis &amp; Cadentis Ecclesiae:</hi> But is there a <hi>Play</hi> to succeed worthy of all this <hi>Prologue</hi>?

               <p>I am just to him; all these Exclusions out of the reckoning he has, if he has not more; And give him these, and he dares affirm, That <hi>they who are Conscientiously for Prelacy, are so few in</hi> Scotland, <hi>that not one of many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds or Thousands is to be found</hi>; 1 Vind. <hi>They who are for Episcopacy are not one of a Thousand in Scotland</hi>; 2 Vind. <hi>Now,</hi> not to fall on examining his <hi>Limitations</hi> singly, because that were to be <hi>sick</hi> of his own <hi>disease.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>first</hi> place, one would think, if he had been allowed his <hi>Limitations,</hi> he might, in all Conscience, have satisfied himself without <hi>begging</hi> the <hi>Question</hi> to boot; Yet, even that he has most <hi>covetously</hi> done; For, I think the <hi>Question</hi> was not, who were Conscientiously for Prelacy or inclined for Episcopacy? But, whither <hi>Prelacy and the Superiority of any Office in the Church above Presbyters was a great and insupportable Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:101025:256"/>
and Trouble to the Nation, and contrary to the inclinations of the Generality of the People</hi>? And there is some <hi>difference,</hi> as I take it, between <hi>these Questions.</hi> But let him take the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Question</hi>; if he must needs have it, I can spare it to him: Nay, if it can do him service, I can grant him yet more: When the Matter comes to be tryed by this his <hi>Standard,</hi> I shall be satisfied that it fall to his share to be <hi>judge</hi>; He should understand his own <hi>Rule</hi> best; and so may be fittest for such <hi>Nice</hi> Decisions, as a point so tender must needs require; Tho', I think, He may take the <hi>short cut,</hi> as we say, and give his own judgment without more ado; For thither it must recur at last; Only I cannot guess why he excluded all <hi>Popishly affected,</hi> &amp;c. Was it to let a <hi>friend</hi> go with a <hi>fee</hi>? I think he might have learned from History, if not, from Experience, that Papists have been amongst the best <hi>friends</hi> to his <hi>Interest</hi>; and very ready to do his party <hi>service</hi> upon occasion, which, it is not to be thought they would have done for <hi>nothing.</hi> But however this is,</p>
               <p>Having granted him so much, I think, he is bound to grant me one little thing; I <hi>ask</hi> it of him only for <hi>peace</hi>; I can <hi>force</hi> it from him, if I please: It is, that all his <hi>Limitations, Restrictions, Exclusions, Castings-out, Settings-aside,</hi> or what ever he pleases to call them, were adduced by him for setting the <hi>Article</hi> in its <hi>Native</hi> and proper <hi>light,</hi> and as it ought to be understood;
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:101025:257"/>
But, if so, I cannot think he himself can repute it <hi>unfair dealing,</hi> to give the world a <hi>fair view</hi> of the <hi>Article</hi> as thus explained and <hi>enlightened</hi>: And so digested, it must run to this purpose, as I take it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Prelacy and the Superiority of any Office in the Church above Presbyters, is, and hath been, a great and insupportable Grievance, and Trouble to this Nation, and contrary to the inclinations of the Generality of the People; Excluding from this Generality of the People,</hi> 1. <hi>All these many ten thousands of the People, who are unconcerned about Religion both in the greater and lesser truths of it.</hi> 2. <hi>All these many of the People who are of opinion that Church-Government, as to the species of it, is indifferent.</hi> 3. <hi>All these other many of the People, whose Light and Conscience do not incline them to Episcopacy, who are yet zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for it, and against Presbytery, because, under the one, they are not censured for their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moralities, as under the other.</hi> 4. <hi>All such of the People as had any dependance on the Court.</hi> 5. <hi>Or on the Prelates.</hi> 6. <hi>Or are Popishly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Protestants only in Masquerade.</hi> And 7. <hi>All such as are Enemies to</hi> K. W. <hi>and the present Civil Government; Ever since the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation:</hi> (<hi>They,</hi> i. e. <hi>such of the People, as are not excluded, from the Generality of the People, by any of the aforesaid Exceptions, having Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Popery by Presbyters</hi>) <hi>and therefore it ought to be Abolished.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So the Article must run, I say, when duely <hi>Englightned</hi> by our Authors <hi>Glosses</hi>; and when a <hi>New Meeting</hi> of Estates shall settle
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:101025:257"/>
another <hi>New Government,</hi> and put such ane <hi>Article</hi> in another <hi>New Claim of Right,</hi> I do hereby give my word, I shall not be the <hi>first</hi> that shall move Controversies about it: But till that is done, <hi>G. R.</hi> must allow me the use of a certain sort of <hi>Liberty</hi> I have, of <hi>Thinking,</hi> at least, that <hi>his wits were a wool-gathering</hi> (to use him as <hi>mannerly</hi> as can be done by one of his own Complements) when he spent so many of <hi>his sweet words</hi> (another of his Phrases) so very <hi>pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus did <hi>G. R.</hi> defend this part of the <hi>Article</hi> against the Arguments of his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries: But did he produce <hi>none,</hi> for his own side of the Controversie? Yes, <hi>one,</hi> and <hi>only</hi> one, so far as I can remember. It is in his Answer to the <hi>first</hi> of the <hi>four Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> §. 7. The Letter written by the <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Chaplain,</hi> as he was pleased to call him.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Military Chaplain</hi> had said, <hi>That the Church Party was Predominant in this Nation both for Number and Quality. That it is not so</hi> (says G. R.) <hi>is evident from the Constitution of our Parliament:</hi> This is the Argument. Now, not to enter upon dangerous or undutiful Questions about Parliaments; I shall say no more at present but this; When <hi>G. R.</hi> shall make it appear that all the Acts and <hi>Deeds</hi> of the present Parliament have been, all alongst, agreeable to the <hi>Inclinations of the Generality of the People</hi>; or when he shall secure the <hi>other part</hi> of the <hi>Article</hi>
                  <pb n="322" facs="tcp:101025:258"/>
against the <hi>Dint</hi> of this his own good Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; I mean, when he shall make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that such reasoning is firm and solid, in the present case, and withal, shall make it appear, that the <hi>Deeds</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>twenty seven Parliaments</hi> (he knows well enough who numbred them to him) Ratifying and consuming Episcopacy, cannot, or ought not to amount to as good ane Argument for the <hi>Inclinations of the Generality of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> in former times: When he shall make these things appear, I say, I shall, then, think a little more about his Argument. This I think is enough for <hi>him.</hi> At present I shall consider it no more; Only, now that he hath brought the present Parliament up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>stage,</hi> I will take occasion to propose some few Questions, which the <hi>minding</hi> of it suggests to me: and I seriously desire (not <hi>G. R.</hi> but) some truly sensible, ingenious, and sober person of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian perswasion; Some person who had opportunity to know how matters went, and a head to comprehend them, and who has Candour and Conscience to relate things as they truly were, or are; To give plain, frank, direct and pertinent answers to them, speaking the sense of his heart, openly, and distinctly, without mincing, and without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ergiversation. My Questions shall not, in the least touch the <hi>Dignity</hi> or <hi>Authority</hi> of the Parliament: All I design them for, is to bring <hi>Light</hi> to the present Controversie. And I ask,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="323" facs="tcp:101025:258"/>1. Whither the Presbyterian party did not exert and concenter, all their Wit and Force, all their Counsel and Cunning, all their Art and Application, all their Skill and Conduct in Politicks, both before and in the beginning of the late Revolution, for getting a <hi>Meeting</hi> of <hi>Estates</hi> formed for their purposes?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whither the Universal <hi>Vnhinging</hi> of all things, then, and the general Surprize, Confusion and Irresolution of the rest of the Nation, occasioned thereby, did not contribute extraordinarily for furthering the Presbyterian Designs and Projects?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whither, notwithstanding all this, when the <hi>Estates</hi> first met, they had not both great, and well-grounded <hi>fears</hi> that their <hi>Projects</hi> might miscarry, and they might be <hi>outvoted</hi> in the <hi>Meeting</hi>?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whither very many, very conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Members had not deserted the <hi>House</hi> before it was thought seasonable to offer at putting the <hi>Article</hi> about <hi>Church-Government</hi> in the <hi>Claim of Right?</hi>

               <p n="13">13. And lastly, I ask, whither our Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Brethren would be content that all that has been <hi>done</hi> in reference to Church Matters, since the beginning of the late Revolution, should be lookt upon as <hi>undone</hi>; and that the <hi>settlement</hi> of the Church should, again, depend upon a <hi>new, free, unclogg'd, unprelimited, unover awed Meeting of Estates?</hi>

               <head>The Fifth Enquiry.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Whither, supposing the Affirmatives in the proceeding Enquiries had been true, they would have been of suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient force, to infer the Conclusion advanced in the Articles, <hi>viz.</hi> that Prelacy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ought to be Abolished?</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe <hi>Affirmatives</hi> are these two; 1. <hi>That Prelacy was a great and Insupportable Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,</hi> &amp;c. 2. <hi>That this Church was Reformed by Presbyters</hi>: The purpose of this Enquiry is to try if these were good Reasons for the <hi>Abolition of Prelacy</hi>; without further Address, I think they were not; Not the</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> viz. <hi>Prelacy's being a great and insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable Grievance and Trouble to this Nation, and contrary to the Inclinations of the Generality of the People.</hi> Sure I am,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Our Presbyterian Brethren had not this way of Reasoning from our <hi>Reformers</hi>; For, I remember <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> in his Letter to the <hi>Queen Regent</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> 
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">Kn. Ap. 90.</note> rejected it with sufficient appearances of <hi>Keenness</hi> and <hi>Contempt</hi>; He called it a <hi>Fetch</hi> of the Devils, to <hi>blind</hi> Peoples eyes, with such a <hi>Sophism</hi>; To make them look on <hi>that Religion as most perfect, which the Multitude, by wrong custom, have embraced,</hi> or to insinuate, <hi>that it is impossible that that Religion should be false,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:101025:261"/>
which so long time, so many Councils, and so great a Multitude of men have Authorized and confirmed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For</hi> (says he) <hi>if the opinion of the Multitude ought always to be preferred, then did God injury to the Original world; For they were all of one mind, to wit, conjured against God, except</hi> Noah <hi>and his family.</hi> And I have shewed already that the <hi>Body</hi> of our <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,</hi> in all their <hi>Petitions</hi> for <hi>Reformation,</hi> made the word of God, the Practices of the Apostles, the Catholick Sentiments and Principles of the Primitive Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not <hi>the inclinations of the People,</hi> the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Reformation.</hi> Nay,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>G. R.</hi> himself is not pleased with this <hi>Standard</hi>; He not only tells the world, <hi>That Presbyterians wished and endeavoured that that Phrase might not have been used as it was</hi>; <note n="(b)" place="margin">2. Vind. in Answ. to Lett. 3. §. 3.</note> But he <hi>ridicules</hi> it in his <hi>first Vindication,</hi> in <hi>Answer</hi> to the <hi>tenth Question,</hi> tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> he made himself <hi>ridiculous</hi> by doing it, as he did it. The Matter is this: The Author of the <hi>ten Questions</hi> finding that this <hi>Topick</hi> of <hi>the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the People,</hi> was insisted on in the Article as ane Argument for Abolishing Prelacy, undertook to Demonstrate that, tho' it were a good Argument, it would not be found to conclude as the <hi>Formers</hi> of the <hi>Article</hi> intended; Aiming, unquestionably, at no more, than that it was not <hi>true,</hi> that <hi>Prelacy was such a great and insupportable Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,</hi> &amp;c. and to make good his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking; He formed his Demonstration, as I have already accounted. Now hear
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:101025:261"/>
                  <hi>G. R. It is a new Topick</hi> (says he) <hi>not often used before, that such a way of Religion is best, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>This his Discourse will equally prove that Popery is preferable to Protestantism; For in</hi> France, Italy, Spain, &amp;c. <hi>not the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude only, but all the Churchmen,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>are of that way.</hi> Thus, I say, <hi>G. R. ridiculed</hi> the <hi>Argument,</hi> tho' he most <hi>ridiculously</hi> fancied, he was <hi>ridiculing</hi> his <hi>Adversary,</hi> who never dream'd that it was a good Argument; But could have been as ready to <hi>ridicule</hi> it, as another: However, I must confess <hi>G. R.</hi> did indeed treat the Argument justly; For</p>
               <p n="3">3. Supposing the Argument good, I cannot see how any <hi>Church</hi> could ever have <hi>Reformed</hi> from <hi>Popery</hi>: For I think, when <hi>Luther</hi> began in <hi>Germany,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Patrick Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> or <hi>Zuinglius</hi> or <hi>Oecolompadius</hi> or <hi>Calvin, &amp;c.</hi> in their respective Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys and Churches, they had the <hi>inclinations of the People generally</hi> against them: Nay, if I mistake not, our Saviour and his Apostles found it so too, when they at first undertook to propagate our Holy Religion; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance, tho' the Christian Religion is now Generally Professed in most Nations in <hi>Europe,</hi> some of them, might be soon <hi>Rid</hi> of it, if this <hi>Standard</hi> were allowed to take place.</p>
               <p>I have heard of some who have not been well pleased with <hi>Saint Paul</hi> for having the word, <hi>Bishop,</hi> so frequently in his Language; and I remember to have been told that <hi>one,</hi>
                  <pb n="330" facs="tcp:101025:262"/>
(not ane <hi>Vnlearn'd</hi> one) in a Conference, being prest with a Testimony of <hi>Irenaeus</hi>'s (in his 3 <hi>Cap.</hi> 3 <hi>Lib. Adversus Her.</hi>) for ane uninterrupted Succession of Bishops in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> from the Apostles times at first, denyed confidently that any such thing was to be found in <hi>Irenaeus</hi>; and when the Book was produced, and he was convinced by ane ocular Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> had the Testimony which was alleged, he delivered himself to this purpose, <hi>I see it is there, Brother, but would to God it had not been there!</hi> Now, had these People, who were thus offended with <hi>St. Paul</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> been at the writing of their Books, is it probable, we should have had them (with their <hi>Imprimatur</hi>) as we have them? Indeed, for my part I shall never consent that the <hi>Bible,</hi> especially the <hi>New Testament,</hi> be Reformed according to some <hi>Peoples inclinations</hi>: For if that should be allowed, I should be very much affraid, there would be strange <hi>cutting</hi> and <hi>carving</hi>: I should be very much affraid, that the <hi>Doctrine of self-preservation</hi> should <hi>justle</hi> out, the <hi>Doctrine of the Cross</hi>; That <hi>Might</hi> should find more <hi>favour</hi> than <hi>Right,</hi> that the <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> should possess themselves of the places, of the <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi> of the <hi>Saints,</hi> and that (beside many other places) we might soon see our last, of (at least) the <hi>first seven verses of the</hi> 13<hi>th Chapter to the</hi> Romans.</p>
               <p>I shall only add one thing more, which <hi>G. R.</hi>'s naming of <hi>France</hi> gave me occasion to
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:101025:262"/>
think on: It is that the <hi>French King</hi> and his <hi>Ministers,</hi> as much as some People talk of their <hi>Abilities,</hi> must, for all that, be, but of the ordinary <hi>Size</hi> of <hi>Mankind</hi>; For, if they had been as <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>thinking</hi> men, as some of their Neighbours, they might have easily stopt all the mouths that were opened against them some years ago, for their <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting</hi> the <hi>Protestants</hi> in that Kingdom; For if they had but narrated in ane <hi>Edict,</hi> that <hi>the Religion of the Hugonots, was, and had still been a great and insupportable Grievance and Trouble to their Nation, and contrary to the Inclinations of the Generality of the People, ever since it was Professed amongst them,</hi> their work was done. I believe <hi>G. R.</hi> himself would not have called the <hi>Truth</hi> of the <hi>Proposition</hi> in Question.</p>
               <p>How easy were it to dwell longer on this subject? But I am affraid, I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed it too much already; To conclude then; What is this <hi>Standard,</hi> else, than the <hi>Fundamental</hi> principle of <hi>Hobbism,</hi> that <hi>Holy Scheme</hi> for <hi>Brutalizing</hi> Mankind, and making Religion, Reason, Revelation, every thing that aims at making men <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> to yeild unto, at least, to depend on, the <hi>Frisks</hi> of <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> or, which is all one, <hi>Arrant sense</hi> and <hi>ungovernable Passion</hi>? And so I leave it. But is the <hi>Second Reason</hi> any better? <hi>If this Church had been Reformed by Presbyters, would that have been a good Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for Abolishing Prelacy?</hi> Who sees not that it is much about the same <hi>Size</hi> with the
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:101025:263"/>
                  <hi>former</hi>? Indeed I am apt to think, had the several Churches in the world erected their Governments, by this <hi>Rule,</hi> we should have had some pretty <hi>odd</hi> Constitutions; Thus, the Church collected, of old, amongst the <hi>Indians,</hi> by <hi>Frumentius</hi> and <hi>Aedesius,</hi> should have been Govern'd still by <hi>Laicks</hi>; For <hi>Frumentius</hi> and <hi>Aedesius</hi> were no more than <hi>Laicks</hi> when they first convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. Thus all <hi>Xaverius</hi>'s Converts and their Successors should have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Govern'd by <hi>Iesuits</hi>; For 'tis past Controversie <hi>Xaverius</hi> was a <hi>Iesuit.</hi> Thus the Churches of <hi>Iberia</hi> and <hi>Moravia</hi> should have been Govern'd by <hi>Women</hi>; For if we may believe Historians, the Gospel got first footing in these parts, by the <hi>Ministery</hi> of <hi>Females.</hi> Indeed, if the Argument has any strength at all, it seems stronger for these Constitutions, than for <hi>Presbytery,</hi> in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> inasmuch as it is more to <hi>Convert Infidels,</hi> than only to <hi>Reform</hi> a Church, which, tho' <hi>Corrupt,</hi> is allowed to be <hi>Christian.</hi> Nay, which is more and worse, <hi>more contrary to the Inclinations of Scotch Presbyterians,</hi> and <hi>worse</hi> for <hi>Scotch Presbytery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this way of Reasoning, <hi>Episcopacy</hi> ought still, hitherto, to have continued, and hereafter, to continue the <hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi>; Because, that <hi>Church</hi> was <hi>Reformed,</hi> by her <hi>Bishops.</hi> But, if so, what can be said for the <hi>Solemn League and Covenant</hi>? How shall we defend our <hi>Forty-three-men</hi> and all the <hi>Covenanting work
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:101025:263"/>
of Reformation,</hi> in that Glorious Period? And if it must continue there, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Perils must our <hi>Kirk</hi> needs be in, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially so long as <hi>both Kingdoms</hi> are under <hi>one Monarch</hi>?</p>
               <p>What I have said, I think, might be enough, in all Conscience, for this <hi>Fifth Enquiry</hi>; But because it is obvious to the most overly Observation, that the <hi>Framers</hi> of the <hi>Article</hi> have not been so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for the <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>solidity</hi> of the Reasons, they choosed for supporting their Conclusion, as for their <hi>Colour</hi> and <hi>Aptitude</hi> to catch the vulgar, and influence the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulace; and because our Presbyterian Brethren have of a long time been, and still are, in use, to make zealous Declamations and huge noises about Succession to our Reformers; Because the clamour, on all occasions, that those who stand for Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy have so much forsaken the <hi>principles</hi> and <hi>maximes</hi> of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> that they <hi>Pay</hi> our <hi>Reformers</hi> so little <hi>Respect</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi>; That they have <hi>Secret Grudges,</hi> at the <hi>Reformation</hi>; That they would willingly <hi>return</hi> to <hi>Popery</hi>; And what not? Whereas, <hi>they themselves</hi> have a <hi>Mighty Veneration</hi> for those who <hi>Reformed</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi>; They are their, only, true, and <hi>Genuine Successors</hi>; They are the <hi>only Men</hi> who stand on the <hi>foot</hi> of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> the only <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere</hi> and <hi>heart</hi>-Protestants, the only <hi>Real Enemies</hi> to <hi>Antichrist, &amp;c.</hi> For these Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, I say, I shall beg the Readers pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:101025:264"/>
till I have discoursed this point a little farther. And to deal frankly and plainly,</p>
               <p>In the first place, I own, those of the Episcopal perswasion in <hi>Scotland,</hi> do not think themselves bound to <hi>maintain</hi> all the <hi>principles,</hi> or <hi>embrace</hi> all the <hi>sentiments,</hi> or <hi>justify</hi> all the <hi>Practices</hi> of our <hi>Reformers.</hi> 'Tis true, I speak only from my self; I have no Commission from other men to tell their sentiments; Yet I think the Generality of my <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Brethren</hi> will not be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, tho' I speak in the <hi>Plural number,</hi> and take them into the reckoning. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I think, I may safely say,</p>
               <p>Tho <hi>we</hi> think, <hi>our Reformers,</hi> considering their Education and all their disadvantages, were very considerable men, and made very considerable progress in Reforming the Church, yet we do not believe, they had ane immediate allowance from Heaven for all they said, or did: We believe they were not endued with the <hi>Gifts</hi> of infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, inerrability or impeccability: We believe (and they believed so themselves) that they had no Commission, no Authority, to Establish new Articles of Faith, or make new Conditions of Salvation; We believe they had no Power, pretended to none, for receding from the Original and immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable <hi>Standard</hi> of Christian Religion. In consequence of this,</p>
               <p>We believe and are confident, that where they <hi>missed</hi> (and being <hi>Fallible,</hi> it was
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:101025:264"/>
very possible for them to do it) of <hi>Conformity</hi> to that <hi>Standard,</hi> we are at <hi>Liberty</hi> to think otherwise, than they <hi>thought</hi>; to Profess otherwise than they professed; We are not bound to follow them. To instance in a few of many things.</p>
               <p>We own we cannot allow of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of <hi>Popular Reformations,</hi> as it was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted and practised by our Reformers. We <hi>own,</hi> indeed, 'tis not only <hi>Lawful,</hi> but <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,</hi> for <hi>every</hi> Man to <hi>Reform</hi> himself both as to <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Practice,</hi> when there is <hi>Corruption</hi> in <hi>either</hi>; And that, not only <hi>without,</hi> but <hi>against</hi> publick Authority, whither <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiastical.</hi> Farther, we <hi>own,</hi> 'tis not only <hi>Lawful,</hi> but plain and <hi>Indispensible Duty</hi> in the <hi>Governours</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> to <hi>Reform</hi> her, Acting in their own <hi>Sphere,</hi> even against <hi>humane Laws,</hi> in direct opposition to a <hi>thousand Acts</hi> of a <hi>thousand Parliaments</hi>; I say, <hi>Acting</hi> and <hi>keeping</hi> within their own <hi>Sphere, i. e.</hi> so far as their <hi>Spiritual Power</hi> can go, but no farther; <hi>Keeping</hi> within these their own bounds, they <hi>may</hi> and <hi>should</hi> condemn <hi>Heresies,</hi> purge the <hi>publick worship</hi> of <hi>Corruptions,</hi> continue a <hi>Succession</hi> of <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox</hi> Pastors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In a word, <hi>do</hi> every thing, which is needful to be <hi>done,</hi> for <hi>put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> and <hi>preserving</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> committed to their <hi>Care,</hi> in that <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Orthodoxy, Purity</hi> and <hi>Vnity,</hi> which <hi>Iesus Christ, from whom</hi> they have their Commission, and <hi>to whom,</hi> they must be Answerable, has <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired</hi> by his holy <hi>Institution.</hi> But we cannot
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:101025:265"/>
allow them to move <hi>Excentrically,</hi> to turn <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant,</hi> to stir <hi>without</hi> their own <hi>Vortex.</hi> We cannot allow them to use any other, than <hi>Spiritual means</hi>; or to make any other than <hi>Spiritual Defences:</hi> We think, they should still perform all <hi>dutiful submission</hi> to the <hi>Civil Powers</hi>; Never <hi>Resist</hi> by <hi>Material Arms</hi>; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>absolve</hi> subjects from their <hi>Allegiance</hi> to their <hi>Civil Sovereign</hi>; Never <hi>Preach</hi> the <hi>Damnable</hi> Doctrine of <hi>Deposing Kings</hi> for <hi>Heresie</hi>; never attempt to make <hi>those</hi> whom they should make <hi>good</hi> Christians, <hi>bad</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: But to <hi>teach</hi> them the great and <hi>fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental</hi> Doctrine of the <hi>Cross,</hi> and <hi>Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plify</hi> it to them, in their <hi>Practice</hi> when they are <hi>Called</hi> to it. This we Profess: And we do not think it <hi>Popery.</hi> But our Reformers taught a quite <hi>different</hi> Doctrine. Their <hi>Doctrine</hi> was that it belong'd to the <hi>Rabble</hi> to <hi>Reform</hi> Religion publickly, to <hi>Reform</hi> it by <hi>Force</hi>; To <hi>Reform</hi> the <hi>State</hi> if <hi>it</hi> would not <hi>Reform</hi> the <hi>Church</hi>; To <hi>Extirpate</hi> all <hi>false</hi> Religion by <hi>their</hi> Authority; To <hi>assume</hi> to themselves a <hi>Power,</hi> to overturn the <hi>Powers</hi> that are <hi>Ordain'd of God</hi>; To <hi>depose</hi> them, and <hi>set</hi> up <hi>new Powers</hi> in their stead, <hi>Powers</hi> that would <hi>Protect,</hi> that, which they <hi>judged</hi> to be the <hi>best</hi> Religion: Whoso pleases may see this Doctrine fully taught by <hi>Knox,</hi> in his <hi>Appellation,</hi>
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">p. 22, 23, 24, &amp;c.</note> and he may see the same principle insisted on by Mr. <hi>Hendersone</hi> in his Debates with <hi>K. C. I.</hi> And who knows not that our <hi>Reformation</hi> was but too much <hi>founded</hi> on this <hi>Principle.</hi> Herein, I

say, we own we have <hi>forsaken</hi> our <hi>Reformers:</hi> And let our <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Brethren, if they can, <hi>Convict</hi> us, in <hi>this,</hi> of <hi>Heresie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In short, our Reformers maintain'd that the Doctrine of <hi>Defensive Arms</hi> was <hi>Necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>: That <hi>Passive Obedience</hi> or <hi>Non-resistance</hi> was <hi>sinful,</hi> when People had <hi>means</hi> for <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance.</hi>

               <p>That all these and more such strange Doctrines were Common and Current amongst them, I am able to prove at full

length, if I shall be put to it. Besides, they had many other Principles relating to other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, which I am perswaded, were not founded on Scripture, had no Countenance from Catholick Antiquity, were not ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to sound and solid Reason, which we <hi>own,</hi> we are so far from maintaining, that we think our selves bound, both to Profess and Practice the contrary. And how easy were it to Confute as well as Represent some of Master <hi>Knox</hi>'s principles which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps were peculiar to him?</p>

               <p>Our <hi>Modern</hi> Presbyterians do not only <hi>Condemn</hi> the <hi>Liturgie</hi> of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (used as I say by our Reformers) calling it a <hi>Dry, lifeless service,</hi> a <hi>spiritless, powerless service</hi>; ane <hi>unwarrantable service</hi>; ane <hi>ill-mumbled mass</hi>; a <hi>farce</hi> of <hi>Popish Dregs</hi> and <hi>Reliques</hi>; a <hi>Rag</hi> of <hi>Romish Superstition</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi>; and God knows how many ill things: But they Generally <hi>Condemn</hi> all <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies,</hi> all <hi>set-forms</hi> of <hi>publick worship</hi> and devotion; They will admit of <hi>none:</hi> All to them are alike odious and intolerable.</p>

Our present Presbyterians will not only, <hi>not use</hi> it, but they <hi>Condemn</hi> and <hi>writ against</hi> the <hi>using</hi> of it. Indeed,</p>

               <p n="4">4.

<pb n="359" facs="tcp:101025:276"/>
of <hi>Measures,</hi> into which the Psalms of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> are put, that it might still succeed, in the conclusion, without changing the <hi>Tune</hi>: It was so generally used, that, (as Doctor <hi>Burnet</hi> in his <hi>Second Conference,</hi> 
                  <note n="(t)" place="margin">Edit. Glasg. p. 182.</note> tells us) even a <hi>Presbyterian General took it in very ill part, when it begun to be disused</hi>: Yet, now, nothing in use, with our present Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians but the <hi>Psalms of David</hi>; and these too, for the most part, without <hi>Discrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi> The <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> recovered from <hi>Desuetude,</hi> at the last <hi>Restitution</hi> of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> and generally used in the Episcopal Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, these <hi>thirty years</hi> past, was a Mighty <hi>Scandal</hi> to them; So great, that even such as came to Church, <hi>hang'd</hi> their <hi>Heads</hi> and sate <hi>silent,</hi> generally, when it came to that <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>Office.</hi>

               <p>Having mentioned Doctor <hi>Burnet</hi>'s <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,</hi> I will transcribe his whole <hi>Period,</hi> because some other things than the <hi>Gloria Patri</hi> are concerned in it. <hi>When some Designers</hi> (says he) <hi>for popularity in the</hi> Western <hi>Parts of that</hi> Kirk <hi>did begin to disuse the</hi> Lord Prayer <hi>in worship, and the singing the conclusion or</hi> Doxologie <hi>after the</hi> Psalm, <hi>and the</hi> Ministers kneeling <hi>for Private Devotion, when he entered the Pulpit, the General Assembly took this in very ill part; And, in the Letter they wrote to the Presbyteries, complained sadly of a</hi> Spirit <hi>of</hi> Innovation <hi>was beginning to get into the</hi> Kirk, <hi>and to throw these</hi> Laudible practices <hi>out of it, mentioning the</hi> three <hi>I named which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded still to be practiced, and such as refused
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:101025:277"/>
Obedience, are appointed to be conferred with, in order to the giving of them satisfaction; And if they continued untractable, the Presbyteries were to proceed against them as they should be answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the next General Assembly.</hi> Thus he; and this Letter, he said, he could produce, <hi>Authentically Attested:</hi> I doubt not, he found it amongst his Uncle <hi>Waristown</hi>'s Papers, who was <hi>Scribe</hi> to the <hi>Rampant</hi> Assemblies from the year 1638, and downward. I wish the <hi>Doctor</hi> had been at pains to have published more of them; If he had imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself that way, I am apt to think he had done his Native Countrey better ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, than he has done her Sister Kingdom by publishing <hi>Pastoral Letters</hi> to be used, he knows how; But even from what he has given us, We may see how much the <hi>disusing</hi> of the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> and the <hi>Doxologie</hi> is a <hi>late Innovation,</hi> as well as a <hi>Recession</hi> from the Pattern of our Reformers. And as for the decent and <hi>Laudable</hi> custom of <hi>kneeling for private Devotion,</hi> used by the Minister when he entered the Pulpit; It may be reckoned</p>

then, it was not Condemned as either <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious</hi> or <hi>indecent</hi>; It was laid aside, only, in complyance with the <hi>English</hi> Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. By that Assembly, a Committee was appointed, to give their opinion, about <hi>keeping a greater Vniformity in this Kirk, in the practice and observation of the</hi> Directory, <hi>in some points of publick worship:</hi> And the fourth Article to which they Agreed, was this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> word for word, <hi>It is also the Iudgment of the Committee, that the Ministers</hi> bowing in the Pulpit, <hi>tho' a</hi> Lawful <hi>Custome in this</hi> Kirk, <hi>be, hereafter, laid aside, for satisfaction of the desires of the Reverend</hi> Divines <hi>in the</hi> Synod <hi>of</hi> England, <hi>and Vniformity with that</hi> Kirk <hi>so much endeared to us.</hi> And then followeth the Assembly's approbation of all the Articles digested by the Committee. Here, 'tis evident this Assembly own'd it to be a <hi>Lawful Custome:</hi> A former Assembly called it <hi>Laudible.</hi> And yet it is <hi>Scandalous</hi> if not <hi>Superstitions</hi> to our present Presbyterians. Let me add as ane Appendage to this,</p>
               <p n="6">6. Another (in my opinion) very <hi>decent,</hi> and commendable <hi>Custome,</hi> which obtain'd in <hi>Scotland,</hi> generally, till the latter times of Presbytery. This, when People entered the Church, they commonly <hi>uncovered</hi> their <hi>Heads,</hi> as entering into the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>God</hi>; And generally they put up a short <hi>Prayer</hi> to <hi>God</hi> (some <hi>kneeling,</hi> some <hi>standing,</hi> as their conveniency allowed them) deeming it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry becoming to do so, when they came thus into the place of Gods <hi>special presence</hi> and
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:101025:278"/>
his <hi>publick worship.</hi> This custom was so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal, that the <hi>vestiges</hi> of it may be, even yet, observed amongst old People, educated before the <hi>Donatism</hi> of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> who continue to retain it; Now adays, 'tis plain <hi>Superstition</hi> to a Presbyterian, not to enter the Church, with his <hi>Head covered. Mas Iohn</hi> himself doth it as <hi>mannerly</hi> as the coursest <hi>Cobbler</hi> in the Parish. In he steps, <hi>uncovers</hi> not till in the Pulpit, claps streight on his <hi>Breech,</hi> and within a little falls to work as the <hi>Spirit moves</hi> him. All the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation must sit <hi>close</hi> in the time of <hi>Prayer</hi>; Clap on their <hi>Bonnets</hi> in the time of <hi>Sermon, &amp;c.</hi> This is the way; and it brings me in mind of ane <hi>observe,</hi> ane old Gentleman has frequently repeated to me, which was, that he found it <hi>impossible to perform Divine worship without Ceremonies; For</hi> (said he) <hi>the Presbyterians themselves, who pretend to be against all Ceremonies, seem, even to Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, precise, in observing the Ceremonies of the Breech,</hi> &amp;c. But—</p>
               <p>Thus I have represented, in some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, how our Presbyterian Brethren have deserted our Reformers in the ordinary <hi>stated</hi> parts of <hi>publick worship.</hi> I proceed now to the <hi>Sacraments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Then, our Reformers had not only a <hi>set form</hi> for Administring the Sacrament of <hi>Baptism</hi>; But, beside the <hi>Father</hi> of the Child, they allowed of <hi>Sureties</hi> or <hi>Sponsors.</hi> This is plain from the conclusion of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course concerning the nature and necessity
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:101025:278"/>
of Baptism, in the <hi>Old Liturgy</hi>; For, the Minister, there, addressed to the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Sponsors,</hi> thus; <hi>Finally to the intent that we may be assured that you the</hi> Father <hi>and the</hi> Sureties, <hi>consent to the performance hereof</hi> (of the conditions mentioned before) <hi>Declare, here, before the Face of this Congregation, the sum of the Faith wherein you believe, and will instruct this Child.</hi> After this there is this Rubrick; <hi>Then the</hi> Father, <hi>or, in his absence, the</hi> God-Father, <hi>shall rehearse the</hi> Articles <hi>of his Faith, which done, the Minister expoundeth the same as followeth.</hi> That which followeth is, a large explanation of the <hi>Apostles Creed, &amp;c.</hi> Thus it was appointed in the <hi>old Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie</hi>; and thus it was <hi>practiced</hi> Universally for some <hi>scores</hi> of years.</p>
               <p>But our <hi>Modern</hi> Presbyterians do not only abhor all Set-forms, as I have said, but, to name <hi>Sponsors</hi> or <hi>Godfathers,</hi> to them is to incur the <hi>Scandal</hi> of <hi>Popery.</hi> The <hi>Apostles Creed</hi> is no agreeable Standard of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith,</hi> into which <hi>one</hi> is <hi>initiated</hi> by <hi>Baptism.</hi> They cannot endure to hear of it, in this <hi>Office.</hi> Whoso presents a Child to them to be Baptized, must promise to bring up the Child in the <hi>Faith,</hi> as it is contained in the <hi>Westminster Confession,</hi> and <hi>the larger and shorter Catechisms.</hi> This they Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire Generally: Not a few <hi>Require</hi> that the Child be educated in the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Solemn League and Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. About the Sacrament of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> I find many considerable alterations. Take these for a Taste.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="364" facs="tcp:101025:279"/>1. It was Administred by our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, by a <hi>set-form,</hi> contained in the <hi>Old Liturgie</hi>: It continued to be so Administred for more than 60 years, by Presbyterians themselves, as I have observed already in the instance of <hi>Scrimgeour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. As for the <hi>frequency</hi> of this most Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian <hi>Office</hi>; The <hi>First Book of Discipline, Head 9th,</hi> 
                  <note n="(v)" place="margin">Spot. 169, 170.</note> Determined thus: <hi>Four times in the year, we think sufficient, for Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lords Table— Albeit we deny not, but every Church for Reasonable causes, may change the time, and Minister the same, oftner.</hi> The General Assembly holden at <hi>Edenburgh, Decemb.</hi> 25. 1562, <hi>Ordained, the Communion to be Ministred four times in the year in Burghs, and twice, in Landward,</hi> 
                  <note n="(w)" place="margin">MS. Pet. 233.</note> The <hi>First Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick</hi> in the <hi>Office</hi> for the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> in the <hi>Old Liturgy,</hi> intimates it was oftner ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred, for thus it runs; <hi>Vpon the day that the Lords Supper is Ministred, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly is used once a Month, or as often as the Congregation shall think expedient,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Our Reformers had no <hi>preparation Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> on the <hi>Saturndays</hi> immediately before the Adminstration of the <hi>Sacrament</hi>: No vestige of any <hi>such Sermons</hi> in the <hi>Old Liturgy,</hi> nor in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Old</hi> Assemblies, nor in any of our Histories. It is plain, <hi>such Sermons</hi> were not required by the Authority of any (even Presbyterian) Assembly till the year 1645. Then, indeed, amongst the <hi>Articles</hi> prepared by the <hi>Committee,</hi> mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, I find this the <hi>seventh Branch</hi>
                  <pb n="365" facs="tcp:101025:279"/>
of the <hi>Third Article,</hi> which was about the <hi>Lords Supper, That there be one Sermon of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, delivered in the ordinary place of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick worship, upon the day immediately preceeding.</hi> And it is clear from the <hi>stile</hi> of these <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> that this was <hi>new</hi>; and had not been practiced, at least generally, before.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Our Reformers thought as little on <hi>Thanksgiving Sermons</hi> on the immediately succeeding <hi>Moondays.</hi> Indeed such were not required, no not by that <hi>Innovating Assembly,</hi> 1645. All it has about <hi>Thanksgiving Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> is in the 8<hi>th Branch</hi> of the aforesaid <hi>Article,</hi> which is this, <hi>That before the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Tables there be only one Sermon deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to those who are to Communicate, and, that, in the Kirk, where the service is to be performed: And that, in the same Kirk, there be</hi> one <hi>Sermon of Thanksgiving, after the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is ended.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. No <hi>Vestige</hi> of <hi>Assistant Ministers</hi> at the Administration of this Sacrament, in the practice of our Reformers; So far as I can learn, it was that same Assembly 1645 which first allowed this, also, in the <hi>Sixth Branch</hi> of the aforesaid <hi>Article,</hi> which is this; <hi>That when the Communion is to be Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in a Parish, one Minister may be imployed for assisting the Minister of the Parish, or at the most two.</hi> Indeed, as our Reformers digested the matter, there was no use for any; The Minister of the Parish, was sufficient, alone, for all the work; for they were careful that it might be no insupportable task; as, sure,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:101025:280"/>
it ought not to be. They neither made it such as might exhaust a mans Spirits, nor over-burden his Memory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In the time of Celebration, they had no <hi>Exhortations</hi> at all, neither <hi>Extemporary</hi> nor <hi>Premeditated</hi>; But the <hi>First Book of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi> appointed thus, <hi>During the Action we think it necessary that some comfortable places of Scripture be Read, which may bring in mind, the Death of the Lord Iesus, and the benefits of the same; For seeing, in that Action, we ought Chiefly to Remember the Lords Death; We judge the Scriptures, making mention of the same, most apt to stir up our dull minds, then, and at all times. The Ministers at their disoretion may appoint the places to be Read as they think good.</hi> And in the <hi>Old Liturgy,</hi> the <hi>Rubrick</hi> appoints thus; <hi>During which time</hi> (the time the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants are at the Table, and participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Elements) <hi>some place of Scripture is Read, which doth lively set forth the Death of Christ,</hi> &amp;c. This continued the custom of the whole Church for <hi>more</hi> than <hi>eighty</hi> years, after the Reformation, without any attempts to <hi>Innovate,</hi> till the often mentioned As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly 1645. Then, and not till then, it was Enacted, <hi>That there should be no Reading in the time of Communicating; But, that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister making a short Exhortation at every Table, thereafter, there should be silence, during the time of the Communicants Receiving, except only when the Minister should express some few short sentences, suitable to the present condition of the
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:101025:280"/>
Communicants, in the Receiving, that they might be incited and quickned in their Meditations, in the Action.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Our Reformers never so much as once dreamed of keeping <hi>Congregational Fasts,</hi> some day of the week, before the Celebration of the Sacrament; Nor of shutting the doors of all the neighbouring Churches, that day, it was to be Celebrated in any Parish Church; Nor of having so many Sermons in the <hi>Church-yard</hi> where the <hi>Office</hi> was performed. Indeed, no such customes entered the thoughts of the very Assembly 1645. At least, if they thought on them, it was rather to <hi>Condemn,</hi> than <hi>Approve</hi> them. Nothing at all, indeed, about the <hi>Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Fast.</hi> But the <hi>other two</hi> are expressly discharged, or, at least, guarded against: For the <hi>ninth Branch</hi> of the Committees <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle</hi> is this, <hi>When the Parishioners are so Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous that their Parish Kirk cannot contain them, so that there is a Necessity to keep out such of the Parish, as cannot conveniently have place; In that case, the Brother, who assist the Minister of the Parish, may be ready, if need be, to give a word of Exhortation, in some convenient place appointed for that purpose, to those of that Parish, who, that day, are not to Communicate, which must not be begun till the Sermon delivered in the Kirk be concluded.</hi> And the eleventh this, <hi>That the Minister who cometh to assist have a special care to provide his own Parish, lest, otherwise, while he is about to Minister comfort to others, his own Flock be left destitute of Preaching.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="368" facs="tcp:101025:281"/>Thus the <hi>Eucharist</hi> was Celebrated by our Reformers; and thus, it was <hi>Innovated</hi> by the Presbyterian General Assembly, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> 1645. Well! what is the Method of our <hi>present</hi> Presbyterians? Whether do they keep by the Measures of our Reformers, or their own Assembly 1645? Or have they receded from <hi>both</hi>? I shall give ane account of their Method, as just and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as I can, and let the world judge.</p>
               <p>The Practice of our present Presbyterians is this. In many places, particularly in the <hi>West,</hi> a <hi>Fast</hi> is kept on some day of the week, before the Sacrament is Celebrated: The Congregation Meets: A <hi>Lecture,</hi> and <hi>two</hi> long <hi>Sermons</hi> are Preached: <hi>Long enough, Good enough</hi>; But if they are not <hi>long,</hi> they are <hi>good</hi> for <hi>nothing.</hi> In all Parishes, on <hi>Saturnday,</hi> afternoon, another <hi>long Sermon</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> and, in most places, a <hi>long one</hi> too, in the <hi>Church-yard,</hi> Preached by some Neighbour-Brother.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Sunday</hi> (the day on which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is given) <hi>six, seven, eight, ten</hi> or <hi>twelve</hi> Ministers, leaving their own Churches emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that day, and without Divine Service, conveen at the Church where the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to be Administred: The People of their Parishes, deprived of the publick worship, at home, resort thither, frequently also. If the Minister who gives the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is a <hi>Gracious Man,</hi> a man of renown'd <hi>zeal</hi> for the <hi>good Cause</hi>; most of the <hi>First-Rate</hi> zealots, both <hi>Masculine</hi> and <hi>Feminine,</hi>
                  <pb n="369" facs="tcp:101025:281"/>
especially, the <hi>Females</hi> of the <hi>first Magnitude,</hi> the <hi>Ladies,</hi> who live within 6, 10, 16, 20, 30 miles distance, must be there also.</p>
               <p>In the morning, pretty early, some two or three hours sooner than ordinary, they fall to work. The Minister of the Parish himself, commonly Preaches a <hi>long long Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> in the Church; After some two hours and ane half, sometimes three full hours, spent in hard labour (too hard for <hi>sides</hi> that are not very <hi>substantial</hi>) He descends from the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> to the <hi>Communion Table,</hi> there he has another <hi>long Discourse,</hi> before he Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrates the Elements; That done, he <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrates,</hi> not by a <hi>form,</hi> that were highly <hi>scandalous</hi> and <hi>unspiritual,</hi> but, as the <hi>ready Gift</hi> serves him. After that, ane <hi>Exhortation,</hi> which wants nothing but the <hi>Formality</hi> of having a <hi>Text</hi> Read, to make it a pretty long <hi>Sermon.</hi> Then the Elements are destri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to those who are set about the <hi>Table</hi>; and that is called, the <hi>First Table.</hi> These, having participated, arise and remove; Others plant themselves about the <hi>Table</hi>: Sometimes the Parish-Minister serves this <hi>Second Table</hi> also; But if he does not, a <hi>fresh Brother</hi> succeeds, with another <hi>long Exhortation</hi>; and so onward, so long as there are People who have not sate down, at <hi>every Table</hi> (and sometimes there may be 10, 12, 14 Tables, more or fewer, as it happens) there is a <hi>new</hi> long <hi>Exhortation,</hi> before the <hi>Destribution</hi> of the <hi>Elements</hi>; and <hi>shorter</hi> ones in the time the Communicants (who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:101025:282"/>
not from the Minister, but from one another, sitting 50, 60, 70, 80, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> about the Table) are <hi>eating and drinking.</hi> After all the <hi>Tables</hi> are served the Minister of the Parish ascends the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> again declaims another <hi>long Harangue,</hi> then <hi>Prays, &amp;c.</hi> and all this, without <hi>Papers,</hi> from the <hi>Magazine</hi> of his <hi>Memory,</hi> unless it be sometimes sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed from the <hi>stores</hi> of the <hi>Extemporary Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> But this is not all.</p>
               <p>All this time, the <hi>Sermons</hi> are <hi>thundering</hi> in the <hi>Church-yard,</hi> sometimes by <hi>pairs</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, if the <hi>Confluence</hi> is <hi>great:</hi> Brother succeeds after Brother, and there is Sermon upon Sermon, indeficient <hi>Sermoning,</hi> till the Congregation within the Church is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, which is not, for the most part, till much of the day is spent, indeed cannot readily be, considering what work there is of it.</p>
               <p>The Congregation dissolved, there is a little breathing time; Then the Bell rings again, and the work is renewed: Some other Brother than the Parish Minister mounts the Pulpit in the Church, in the afternoon; and Preaches a <hi>Thanksgiving Sermon,</hi> and the rest are as busy in the <hi>Church yard</hi> as ever: And then on <hi>Moondays</hi> morning the <hi>Preaching</hi> work is fallen to a fresh and pursued vigorously, one <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> another in the <hi>Church yard,</hi> as formerly. I am sure I am just in all this Account; I could prove it by many instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, if it were needful, but I shall only name two. Thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="371" facs="tcp:101025:282"/>Last year when this Sacrament was Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated at <hi>St. Cuthberts,</hi> where the renown'd Mr. <hi>David Williamsone</hi> Exercises, on the <hi>three</hi> dayes, <hi>viz. Saturday, Sunday</hi> and <hi>Moonday,</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Church-yard,</hi> there were no fewer than 12 or 13 <hi>formal Sermons,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides all the <hi>Incidental Harrangues,</hi> and all the <hi>Exhortations</hi> at the <hi>Tables, &amp;c.</hi> And when the Sacrament was given in the <hi>New Church</hi> in the <hi>Canon-gate</hi> in <hi>September,</hi> or the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>October</hi> 1692, there was much about the same number. I my self overheard parts of some <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four</hi> which were Preached in the <hi>Church-yard</hi>: And that which made me have the <hi>deeper impressions</hi> of the unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness of this their Method, was, that all who were in the <hi>Church-yard,</hi> on <hi>Sunday,</hi> at least, and <hi>four</hi> times as many, might, that day, have had room enough in the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> which were at no great distance: But, it seems, the solemnity of <hi>Church-yard Sermons,</hi> is now become necessary on such occasions.</p>
               <p>I have narrated nothing in this strange account (I say) but what is <hi>Notorious Matter of Fact</hi>: All this <hi>Parade</hi> they have, ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, even in the Countrey; and tho' there are but some <hi>scores,</hi> or, at most, but some <hi>hundreds</hi> to Communicate, yet the <hi>Communion</hi> is not <hi>Solemn enough,</hi> there's a <hi>Cloud</hi> upon the Ministers reputation, something or other is wrong, if there are not some <hi>thousands</hi> of <hi>Spectators.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I doubt not, when strangers Read this
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:101025:283"/>
account, they will think it a very surprizing one: And no wonder, for, not to insist how much they have <hi>receded,</hi> not only from the <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> of our <hi>Reformers,</hi> but even from the Determinations of their own General Assembly 1645; not only receded from them, but, almost, in every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, run quite <hi>Counter</hi> to them: not to insist on what occasions, may be given to much scandal, and many wickednesses, by such indigested, disorderly, confused, and mixt Convocations: For who knows not that <hi>hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds,</hi> generally, <hi>strangers</hi> to one another, who have no sense of, no concern for, no care about serious Religion, may meet, on such occasions, for Novelty, for Curiosity, for <hi>Intrigues</hi> not to be named, for a thousand such sinister ends? Not to insist on these things, I say, tho' they are of no small consequence: What a vast difference is there between <hi>such</hi> Communions, and the <hi>Orderly</hi> and <hi>Devout</hi> Communions of the <hi>Primitive Church</hi>? What would the Ancient <hi>Lights</hi> and <hi>Guides</hi> of the Christian Church, who would suffer <hi>none</hi> to stay in the Church but such as were to <hi>Participate,</hi> say, if they saw such <hi>promiscuous Routs</hi> assembled, and mostly, for no other end, than making a <hi>Spectacle</hi> of such a <hi>Venerable Mystery</hi>? Is not such unaccountable <hi>Parade</hi> much liker to the <hi>Popish Processions,</hi> than the <hi>Devout Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances</hi> of the <hi>purer times</hi> of <hi>Genuine Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>? How impossible were it, at this rate, to Celebrate the Sacrament, <hi>once</hi> a <hi>Month</hi>
                  <pb n="373" facs="tcp:101025:283"/>
in every Parish Church? How much more impossible to restore it to its <hi>due</hi> and <hi>proper frequency</hi>? How far is this from looking on this Holy Sacrament, as ane <hi>ordinary,</hi> tho' a very <hi>signal</hi> part of <hi>Divine worship?</hi> Or rather is it not to make a <hi>Prodigie</hi> of this <hi>Divine Mystery</hi>? Certainly, when People observe how seldome, and withal, with what <hi>strange Pomp,</hi> with what, ordinarily, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable solemnity such ane holy ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is gone about, it cannot but work differently upon their different dispositions, It stands <hi>fair</hi> to be a <hi>Scare-crow</hi> to the <hi>weak</hi> Christian; He dares not <hi>approach,</hi> where there is so much <hi>frightening Address</hi>; It stands as <hi>fair</hi> for being a <hi>scandal</hi> to the <hi>strong</hi> and understanding Christian, when he sees so much <hi>vain shew,</hi> so much <hi>needless ostentation,</hi> so much <hi>odd, external tricking</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> about it; And the <hi>Hypocrite</hi> can hardly <hi>wish</hi> any thing more useful for him; For who should doubt of <hi>his</hi> being a <hi>Saint,</hi> when he <hi>approaches,</hi> amidst so <hi>much</hi> solemnity? Besides,</p>
               <p>Every body may easily see what is aim'd at by all this; It is, as they think, a proper Method for <hi>catching</hi> the <hi>Populace</hi>; It is to make them <hi>admire</hi> the <hi>Devotion,</hi> the <hi>Religion,</hi> the <hi>Abilities</hi> of the <hi>Party.</hi> How <hi>Glorious</hi> and <hi>August</hi> are their <hi>Communions!</hi> What <hi>singular preparations</hi> have they!

However expedient it may be, upon some Emergent <hi>Occasions,</hi> or <hi>Necessities,</hi> to require suitable Obligations of <hi>Office-bearers</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> yet, no man, I think, who loves <hi>Christian Simplicity</hi> and <hi>Vnity,</hi> but will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, 'tis <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>prudent,</hi> to <hi>make</hi> the <hi>terms</hi> of <hi>Communion</hi> as <hi>Catholick</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive,</hi> as <hi>Christs institutions</hi> will allow them to be <hi>made.</hi> Now, not to insist on our Brethrens <hi>separating,</hi> from the <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of <hi>those,</hi> who <hi>keep</hi> by the <hi>terms</hi> of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion required by our <hi>Reformers,</hi> whereby they expressly <hi>Condemn</hi> the Communion of our Reformers: not to insist on this, I say, tho' it might be more than enough, to prove their <hi>Recession</hi> from the principles of our Reformers, in this Matter:</p>
               <p>Our Presbyterian Brethren are bound by ane <hi>Express Act</hi> of the <hi>General Assembly</hi> 1648, not to give the Sacrament of the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> to any who do not, first, <hi>swear</hi> the <hi>Solemn League and Covenant.</hi> The occasion was this.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of that year 1648, most part of the Nobility and Gentry of <hi>Scotland</hi> having come to a sense of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series and Calamities, the Kingdomes had been involved in, by the <hi>horrid Rebellion,</hi> which had, then, prevail'd, too long, and too successfully; and willing to acquit themselves, for <hi>once,</hi> as dutiful subjects, for the relief of their suffering Soveraign, at that time, most sadly oppress'd, and kept in prison, by a prevailing party of his
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:101025:285"/>
most undutiful subjects, entered into a most <hi>Dutiful Confederacy,</hi> commonly called <hi>Duke Hamiltons Engagement</hi>; by the Presbyterians, <hi>the Vnlawful Engagement:</hi> And in pursuance thereof, made suitable preparations, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Arms, levied men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to form an Army. The Presbyterian Preachers were generally against it; Preached and Prayed <hi>Damnation</hi> and <hi>Ruine</hi> to the <hi>undertakers,</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd the <hi>undertaking</hi> as Unlawful and Perjurious, as Traiterous to the <hi>Cause</hi> of God, and a <hi>Breach</hi> of <hi>Solemn League and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> and what not? Particularly,</p>
               <p>The <hi>Presbytery</hi> of <hi>Edenburg,</hi> the leading Presbytery, the Presbytery which sate upon the <hi>Watch-Tower,</hi> of the Nation, shewed, I must say, <hi>Remarkable,</hi> tho' I cannot say, <hi>Good</hi> Example to the <hi>Rest</hi> of the <hi>Presbyteries,</hi> in the Months of <hi>May</hi> and <hi>Iune</hi>; They rack't their inventions for falling on methods to crush and disappoint the Designs of the <hi>Engagers.</hi> For instance, they set on foot this Politick in the Respective Parishes, within their <hi>District,</hi> that the <hi>Ministers</hi> and <hi>Kirk-Sessions</hi> should form <hi>supplications</hi> against the <hi>Engagement,</hi> and give them in to the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi> who were to give them in to the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee</hi> of <hi>Estates,</hi> and thereby, to represent to them how much their undertaking was <hi>contrary to the Inclinations of the Generality of the People.</hi> The Device took effect in some Parishes: The <hi>Kirk-Sessions</hi> of <hi>Edenburgh, Holy-Rude-chouse, Duddingstown, Liberton, Rutho, Curry, Cramond,</hi> gave in their sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:101025:285"/>
declaring that they could not be <hi>satisfyed in their Consciences</hi> about the <hi>Lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of the <hi>Engagement.</hi> I have instanced in the forwardness of the <hi>Presbytery</hi> of <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> to give my Reader a Taste of the humour of these times; nor is it to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that others were asleep, while they were so diligent.</p>
               <p>The General Assembly met on the <hi>twelfth</hi> of <hi>Iuly,</hi> they justifyed the endeavours and diligence used before, against the <hi>Engagement,</hi> with a witness: They approved all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations, Remonstrances, Representations, Petitions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> against it, which had been made by the <hi>Commission of the Kirk</hi>: They Declared there was no possibility of secur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Religion, so long as this Unlawful En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement was carried on. They made <hi>Acts and Declarations against Acts of Parliament</hi>; and Threatned all who should Obey them, with the wrath of God and the <hi>Censures</hi> of the <hi>Kirk:</hi> They gave out their <hi>publick warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> against it, and wrote to their <hi>Covenanted Brethren</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> shewing their utter ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of it: They made their Act De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring <hi>silence</hi> about it, a <hi>Crime,</hi> and requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Ministers to make <hi>the main current of their Applications in Sermons against it, under the pain of being Censured by their Presbyteries.</hi> And to shew their sincerity and real zeal in all this, and for preventing all such ungodly <hi>Engagements,</hi> for the time to come, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They made this Act, <hi>That hereafter all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, whatsoever, should take the Covenant, at
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:101025:286"/>
their first Receiving of the Lords Supper, requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Provincial Assembly's and Presbyteries to be careful, that this Act should be observed, and account thereof taken, in the visitation of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Kirks, and the tryal of Presbyteries.</hi> If this was not to <hi>streighten</hi> Christian Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, if this was not to impose <hi>strange terms,</hi> on all who desired this Holy Sacrament, let the world judge: And it is very well known that for some years thereafter this Act was observed. Perhaps it were no difficult task to give ane account of many strange things which happened in pursuance of this Act: But I shall content my self at present with one instance.</p>
               <p>In pursuance of the <hi>Politick,</hi> of the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery</hi> of <hi>Edenburg,</hi> mention'd before, the Ministers of <hi>South Leith,</hi> proposed, to that <hi>Kirk-Session</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the overture of <hi>supplicating,</hi> against the <hi>Engagement.</hi> The Plurality of the Elders rejected it: This was in <hi>May</hi> or <hi>Iune</hi>; The <hi>Engagement,</hi> as every body knows, was unsuccessful; The Army was <hi>Routed</hi> at <hi>Preston, &amp;c.</hi> and the <hi>Kirk</hi> had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to be avenged of <hi>Malignants.</hi> The <hi>Presbytery</hi> of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> therefore, on the <hi>sixth</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> that same year, kept a <hi>Visitation</hi> at the Church of <hi>South Leith</hi>; they made diligent Enquiry, who of the <hi>Elders,</hi> refused to <hi>supplicate</hi> against the <hi>Engagement</hi>; They <hi>Deposed</hi> them from their Office, and they ordered the Ministers to go about ane Election of a <hi>New Session.</hi> But this was not all.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="379" facs="tcp:101025:286"/>Upon the 8<hi>th</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> they met again, to digest a Method for <hi>Renewing</hi> the <hi>Covenant,</hi> in obedience to the Assemblies <hi>Act</hi>; and particularly, they Ordained <hi>that such Seducers as disswaded others from petitioning against the Engagement should be debarred from the</hi> COVENANT. Nay upon the 24<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1648/9 it was ordered, particularly, <hi>That those in South Leith who had accession to the Paper drawn in Captain</hi> Ramsey's <hi>house,</hi> (which Paper, so far as one can Conjecture, from the Depositions of the Witnesses about it, was nothing but ane Apologetick, for their not supplicating) <hi>as also those who were sent from the Corporations</hi> (the Town, as I think, is divided into four Corporations) <hi>to the Ministers and Session, to desire them to forbear supplicating, against the Engagement, should make publick acknowledgement of their Offence, before they should have permission to take the Covenant:</hi> So that at last, as is obvious, the matter resulted in this: The <hi>Elders</hi> of <hi>South Leith,</hi> and <hi>those</hi> who came from the <hi>Corporations</hi> to the <hi>Session</hi> to <hi>Disswade</hi> from <hi>supplicating,</hi> could not have the <hi>Sacrament</hi> without first taking the <hi>Covenant</hi>; and they could not have the <hi>Benefit</hi> of the <hi>Covenant</hi> (as it was then Deem'd) till they should make <hi>publick acknowledgement</hi> of the Heinous <hi>Guilt</hi> of <hi>not supplicating,</hi> and, as <hi>Seducers, Disswading others</hi> from <hi>supplicating,</hi> against the <hi>Unlawful Engagement.</hi> For the Truth of this I Appeal to the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>publick Register</hi> of that <hi>Presbytery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="380" facs="tcp:101025:287"/>I know, our Presbyterian Brethren will be ready to say, that this was only a <hi>Deed</hi> of the particular <hi>Presbytery</hi> of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> so that, if there was any thing amiss in it, it ought not to be imputed to the whole party: If this be said, I have these things to reply; 1. What did the Presbytery here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that was not in pursuance of the <hi>publick Spirit</hi> of the times, and the Acts of the General Assembly? But then 2. as extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant as the <hi>Presbytery</hi> of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> was in this matter, They came not up, it seems, to the full <hi>Measures</hi> of <hi>Rigiditie,</hi> which the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Assembly,</hi> required: For whoso pleases to turn over, in the <hi>Register,</hi> to the 31<hi>st</hi> of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1648/9, shall find that the <hi>Commission of the Kirk</hi> (the <hi>Authentick Vehicle</hi> of the <hi>publick Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Kirk,</hi> during the Interval between Assemblies) wrote a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the <hi>Presbytery, Requiring, greater accuracy in the Tryal of Malignants, and admitting Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the Renovation of the Covenant, prohibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Kirk-Sessions to meddle in such Matters, and Ordering all to be done by the Presbyteries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; Except very difficult Cases, which were to be referr'd to the Commission of the Kirk.</hi> And to secure this side also, let him turn over to the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>General Assembly, Anno</hi> 1649, and he shall find <hi>First Act</hi> Intituled, <hi>Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the proceedings of the Commissioners of the General Assembly</hi>; by which Act that Assembly (Acted by that <hi>same Spirit,</hi> with the former) found that the <hi>Commissioners</hi> appointed, <hi>Anno</hi> 1648. <hi>had been zealous,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:101025:287"/>
diligent and faithful in the discharge of the trust committed to them, and therefore did unanimously Approve and Ratify the whole Proceedings, Acts, and Conclusions of the said Commission; Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr.</hi> John Bell, <hi>Moderator</hi> pro tempore, <hi>to return them hearty thanks, in the name of the Assembly, for their great pains, travel, and fidelity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be said, farther, that our <hi>present Presbyterians</hi> require not, now, that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of taking the <hi>Covenant</hi> of those, they admit to the <hi>Sacrament:</hi> I reply, 1. do not the <hi>Cameronians,</hi> who, in all <hi>true Logick,</hi> are to be reputed the <hi>Truest</hi> Presbyterians observe it punctually?</p>
               <p n="2">2. How can our present <hi>Regnant</hi> Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians justify their <hi>Omission</hi> of it? By their own principles the Act binds them; for it stands as yet unrepealed by any subsequent General Assembly: By the common prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Reason they are bound, either to obey that Act or Reprobate the Assembly which made it. This I am sure of, they can neither plead the <hi>Dissuetude</hi> of that Act, nor any <hi>Peculiarity</hi> in the Reason of it, for their neglecting it, more, than many other Acts which they own still to be in vigour: But I am affraid my Reader has too much of this.</p>
               <p>Thus I have shewed, in part, how much our Presbyterian Brethren have Deserted the <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Rites</hi> of our Reformers about the Sacraments, proceed we now to other <hi>Liturgical Offices.</hi>

                  <pb n="382" facs="tcp:101025:288"/>8. Then, our Reformers not only appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a <hi>form</hi> for the Celebration of <hi>Marriage,</hi> (to be seen in the <hi>Old Liturgy</hi>) but in that <hi>Form</hi> some things agree word for word with the <hi>English Form</hi>; Particularly, <hi>the charge to the Persons to be Marryed to Declare if they know any impediment,</hi> &amp;c. A <hi>Solemn Blessing</hi> was also appointed, to be pronounced on the Married Persons; and after that the 128 Psalm to be sung, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Besides it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly appointed, by the <hi>First Book of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, that Marriages should be only Solemnized on Sunday, in the forenoon, after Sermon,</hi> Cap. 9. <note n="(y)" place="margin">Spot. 169.</note> And this was so Universally observed, that the Introduction of <hi>Marrying,</hi> on <hi>other days,</hi> is remarkable: For it was proposed to the General Assembly, holden at <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg, Iuly</hi> 7. <hi>Anno</hi> 1579, as a <hi>doubt, whither it was Lawful to Marry on week days, a sufficient number being present, and joyning Preaching there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto</hi>? and the General Assembly Resolved <hi>It was Lawful.</hi> 
                  <note n="(z)" place="margin">MS. Pet. 400.</note> But</p>
               <p>Our present Presbyterians, if I mistake not, make it rather a <hi>Doubt,</hi> whither it be <hi>Lawful</hi> to <hi>Marry</hi> on <hi>Sunday</hi>: Sure I am, it is inconsistent with their principles to do it by a <hi>Form</hi>: As sure I am, tho' they were for a <hi>Form</hi> they could not well digest the <hi>Form</hi> of our <hi>Reformers</hi>; which <hi>smell'd</hi> so <hi>rankly</hi> of the <hi>English Corruptions</hi>: I know not if they use, solemnly, to <hi>Bless</hi> the <hi>Married Pair:</hi> If they do it not, I know they have Deserted their own <hi>Second Book of Discipline.</hi> I think they will not deny but the singing of
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:101025:288"/>
the 128 <hi>Psalm</hi> in the Church, immediately after the Persons are Married, is out of fashion, with them.</p>
               <p n="9">9. They have also forsaken our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers in the <hi>Burial of the Dead</hi>: 'Tis true, indeed, the <hi>First Book of Discipline</hi> seems to be against <hi>Funeral Sermons,</hi> neither doth it frankly allow of <hi>Reading</hi> suitable portions of Scripture, and singing Psalms at <hi>Burials</hi>; Yet it was far from Condemning these Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices: <hi>We are not so precise in this</hi> (say the Compilers) <hi>but that we are content that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches, with Consent of the Minister, do that, which they shall find most fitting, as they will Answer to God, and the Assembly of the Vniversal Church, within this Realm.</hi> 
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">Spot. 173.</note> But the <hi>Old Liturgy,</hi> which was Authorized by <hi>two General Assemblies</hi> (which the <hi>First Book of Discipline</hi> could never pretend to) has not only a <hi>Form for visiting the Sick</hi> (not observed, I am sure, by our present Presbyterians) but expressly allows of Funeral Sermons. These are its very words about <hi>Burial. The Corps shall be Reverently brought to the Grave, accompanyed with the Congregation, without any further Ceremonies; which being Buried, the Minister, if he be present, and required, goeth to the Church, if it be not too far off, and maketh some Comfortable Exhortation to the People, touching Death, and the Resurrection; Then Blesseth the People, and dismisseth them.</hi> To our present Presbyterians, <hi>Funeral Sermons</hi> are as the <hi>worshipping</hi> of <hi>Reliques</hi>; They are every whit as ill as <hi>Praying for the Dead,</hi> and
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:101025:289"/>
the Doctrine of <hi>Purgatory.</hi> One thing more I shall take notice of in the <hi>Old Liturgy.</hi> It is</p>
               <p n="10">10. The <hi>Form and Order of the Election of the Superintendent, which may serve, in Election of all other Ministers.</hi> I shall not repeat what I have already observed as to this point, concerning our Presbyterians Condemning the Office of Superintendents; and their forsaking our Reformers, as to the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>imposition of hands,</hi> in Ordinations; a point wherein our Reformers, I confess, were somewhat unaccountable. That which I take notice of now, is, that that <hi>Form</hi> continued, at least, for <hi>sixty</hi> years, to be used in Ordinations: Particularly it was in use, even with the <hi>Parity men, Anno</hi> 1618, as is evident from <hi>Calderwood,</hi> 
                  <note n="(b)" place="margin">Cal: 712.</note> and it was insisted on by them, then, as a <hi>Form,</hi> which was to be reputed so venerable, and of such weight, that any <hi>Recession</hi> from it, was ane <hi>intollerable innovation:</hi> And yet I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to our present Presbyterians them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, if they can say that they have not intirely Deserted it. Because the Designa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Person to be Ordained is <hi>Prior</hi> in order of nature to his Ordination; I shall add as ane <hi>Appendage</hi> to this Head, the <hi>Discrepance</hi> between our <hi>Reformers</hi> and our <hi>present Presbyterians,</hi> about <hi>Patronages</hi> and <hi>Popular Elections:</hi> of Ministers.</p>
               <p>Our present Presbyterians, every body knows, are zealous for the <hi>Divine Right</hi> of <hi>Popular Elections:</hi> The <hi>Power</hi> of Choosing
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:101025:289"/>
their own Ministers, <hi>The Persons who are to have the charge of their Souls,</hi> is a <hi>Priviledge</hi> which <hi>Christ,</hi> by his <hi>Testament,</hi> hath <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed</hi> to his <hi>People:</hi> It is his <hi>Legacy</hi> to them; ane <hi>unalienable part</hi> of their <hi>Spiritual Property</hi>; It cannot be taken from them without a <hi>Direct crossing of Christs institution,</hi> and the horrid <hi>sin</hi> of <hi>Robbing</hi> his People of their <hi>indisputable</hi> Priviledge. <hi>Patronages</hi> are ane <hi>Intollerable Grievance, and Yoak of Bondage on the Church: They have been always the cause of Pestering the Church with a bad Ministery; They came in amongst the latest Anti-Christian Corruptions and Vsurpations,</hi> &amp;c. This is their Doctrine, tho', 'tis obious to all the world, they put strange Comments on it by their Practice: Well! What were the sentiments of our Reformers in this Matter?</p>
               <p>The <hi>First Book of Discipline,</hi> indeed, affirms (<hi>Head</hi> 4.) <hi>That it appertaineth to the People and to every several Congregation to Elect their own Minister:</hi> But it has not so much as one syllable of the <hi>Divine institution</hi> of such a <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge</hi>: On the contrary, in that same very breath, it adds, <hi>and in case they be found neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent therein, the space of</hi> 40 <hi>days, the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendent with his Council may present a Man,</hi> &amp;c. If this Man after tryal is found quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and the Church can justly reprehend nothing in his Life, Doctrine or Utterance, then, <hi>We judge</hi> (say our Reformers) <hi>the Church, which, before, was destitute, unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, if they refuse him, whom the Church
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:101025:290"/>
doth offer; And that they should be compelled, by the Censure of the Council, and Church, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Person appointed and approved by the Iudgment of the Godly and Learned; unless that the same Church hath presented a Man better, or as well, Qualified, to Examination, before that the aforesaid tryal was taken of the Person, presented by the Council of the whole Church. As for Example, the Council of the Church presents a Man unto a Church to be their Minister, not knowing that they are otherwise provided; In the mean time, the Church hath another sufficient, in their judgement, for that charge, whom they present to the Learned Ministers, and next Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Church to be examined: In this case, the presentation of the People to whom he should be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Pastor, must be preferred to the presenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Council or greater Church, unless the Person presented by the inferiour Church be judged unable for the Regiment, by the Learned. For this is always to be avoided, that no man be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded or thrust in upon any Congregation. But this Liberty, with all care, must be reserved for every several Church, to have their voices and suffrages in Election of their Ministers; Yet we do not call that violent intrusion, when the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of the Church, in the fear of God, regarding only the salvation of the People, offereth unto them, a man sufficient to instruct them, whom they shall not be forced to admit before just Examination.</hi> So that Book. Add to this, this conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, That at that time the <hi>Popish Clergy</hi> were in possession of all the Benefices; the Reformed Clergy had not, then, so much

as the prospect of the <hi>Thirds,</hi> which I have discoursed of, before: These things laid together, 'tis obvious to perceive, 1. That it was only from <hi>Prudential Considerations,</hi> our Reformers were inclined to give the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> so much <hi>Power</hi> at that time; It was much for the <hi>Conveniency</hi> of the Ministers, who were to <hi>live</hi> by the <hi>Benevolence</hi> of the Parish, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They did not grant them this <hi>Power,</hi> as of <hi>Divine Right</hi>; No such thing so much as once insinuated, as I have said; 'Twas plainly nothing but a <hi>Liberty.</hi> And no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, no <hi>violence</hi> was done to a Parish, even in these circumstances of the Church, when the <hi>Council</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> gave them a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster without their <hi>own Election.</hi> 'Tis as plain, 2. that (so far as can be collected from the whole Period above) our Reformers (the Compilers of the Book I mean) abstracting from the, then, circumstances of the Church were more inclined, that the <hi>Election</hi> of Ministers should be in the hands of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> than of the <hi>People</hi>; Which I am much inclined to think was not only, then, but a long time after, the prevailing senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; And all the world sees, I am sure, it was a sentiment utterly inconsistent with the opinion of the <hi>Divine Right</hi> of <hi>Popular Elections.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have been at pains to set the <hi>First Book of Discipline,</hi> thus in its due light, that our Brethren may not complain, it was neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not that my Cause required it; For that <hi>Book</hi> was never <hi>Law,</hi> either <hi>Civil</hi> or
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:101025:291"/>
                  <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> and so I might fairly have omitted it. Let us try next what were truly the <hi>publick</hi> and <hi>Authoritative sentiments</hi> of our <hi>Reformers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first which I find of that nature, is the sentiment of the <hi>General Assembly,</hi> holden in <hi>September</hi> 1565. The <hi>General Assembly</hi> holden in <hi>Iune</hi> immediately before, had complained, that <hi>some vacant Benefices had been bestowed by the Queen, on some Noblemen and Barons.</hi> 
                  <note n="(c)" place="margin">MS. Pet. 342.</note> The Queen answered, <hi>She thought it not Reasonable to deprive her of the Patronages belonging to her:</hi> And this General Assembly in <hi>September</hi> answer thus: <hi>Our mind is not that her Majesty, or any other Person, should be defrauded of their just Patronages, but we mean, whensoever her Majesty, or any other Patron, do present any Person, unto a Benefice, that the Person presented should be tryed and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, by the judgement of Learned Men of the Church; Such as are, for the present, the Superintendents: And as the presentation of the Benefice belongs to the Patron, so the Collation, by Law and Reason, belongeth to the Church.</hi>
                  <note n="(d)" place="margin">MS. Pet. 344. Spot. 193.</note> Agreeably, we find, by the 7 <hi>Act</hi> 1 <hi>Parl. Iac.</hi> 6. <hi>Anno</hi> 1567. (The Parliament holden by <hi>Murray</hi> Regent) It was enacted (in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance (no doubt) of the <hi>Agreement</hi> between the Nobility and Barons, and the Clergy in the General Assembly, holden in <hi>Iuly</hi> that year) <hi>That the Patron should present a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified Person, within six Months, to the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendent of these parts, where the Benefice lyes,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>'Tis true, indeed, the <hi>Second Book of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, Cap.</hi> 12. §. 10.

For to my skill (which I confess is not very great) it seems, as we use to say, to have both <hi>burnt</hi> and <hi>blown</hi> Patronages; <hi>blown</hi> them by this Act, and <hi>burnt</hi> them by Ratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Book</hi> which <hi>Condemn'd</hi> them. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is of this, that which I observe 2. is
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:101025:292"/>
far more considerable; For tho' the <hi>Book</hi> Condemned <hi>Patronages,</hi> yet our Presbyterian Brethren, of the <hi>Modern Cut,</hi> have no great advantage by it, for it had nothing less in its prospect, than to Condemn them, for making way for <hi>Popular Elections.</hi> Indeed it gave no countenance to such Elections, far less did it suppose or assert them to be of <hi>Divine Right.</hi> This is its Determination in the 9<hi>th</hi> § of that 12. <hi>Cap. The Liberty of Electing Persons to Ecclesiastical Functions, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served without interruptions, so long as the Church was not corrupted by Anti-Christ, we desire to be restored and retained within this Realm; So as none be intruded upon any Congregation, either by the Prince, or any other inferior Person,</hi> WITHOUT LAWFUL ELECTION, <hi>and</hi> THE ASSENT OF THE PEOPLE, <hi>over whom the Person is placed, according to the Practice of the Apostolick and Primitive Church.</hi> Now, 1. considering that it was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon talk, of the Presbyterians, of these times, that <hi>Antichristian Corruptions,</hi> began to <hi>pester</hi> the Church, so soon as <hi>Episcopacy</hi> was introduced, It is clear, that that which they call the <hi>Vninterrupted Practice of the Church,</hi> must have descended, according to themselves but for a very <hi>few years</hi>: and I shall own my self their humble servant, if our present Presbyterians shall prove that <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Elections</hi> were in <hi>Vniversal uninterrupted Practice,</hi> during that interval, of their own making; the interval, I mean which they make between the Apostles times, and the
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:101025:292"/>
first Introduction of Episcopacy. Indeed, 2. the <hi>Book</hi> plainly <hi>distinguishes</hi> between LAWFUL ELECTION, and THE AS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SENT OF THE PEOPLE, and all the world knows they are naturally <hi>distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi>; and whosoever knows any thing of the Monuments of these Primitive times, knows they were <hi>actually distinguished</hi>; and that all the <hi>Peoples</hi> Priviledge was to AS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SENT, not, to ELECT; They were not in use of <hi>Electing,</hi> if I mistake not, till to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of the <hi>third Century:</hi> So that, if we can believe the <hi>Compilers</hi> of the <hi>Book</hi>; if they were for restoring the <hi>Primitive Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi>; 'tis easy to understand that they meant no such thing as to restore <hi>Popular Elections.</hi> Especially, if 3. it be considered that we have one very Authentick Explication of this 9<hi>th</hi> Article of the 12. <hi>Cap.</hi> of the <hi>Second Book of Discipline,</hi> handed down to us by <hi>Calderwood</hi> himself. <note n="(k)" place="margin">Cald. 383.</note> The story is this.</p>

of the most part of the Flock, and also of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons necessary in the Election of Pastors?</hi> Now, <hi>Calderwood</hi> says, <hi>that there were Brethren dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated from every Presbytery of</hi> Fife, <hi>who met at</hi> St. Andrews <hi>upon the</hi> 21. <hi>of</hi> February, <hi>and, having tossed the Kings Questions, sundrie days,</hi> gave Answers to every one of them, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, to the <hi>third,</hi> this was their Answer, <hi>The Election of Pastors should be made by those, who are Pastors, and Doctors Lawfully called, and who can try the Gifts, necessarily belonging to Pastors, by the word of God: And to such as are so chosen, the Flock and Patron should give their Consent and Protection.</hi> 
                  <note n="(m)" place="margin">Cald. 383.</note> Now this, I say, is a very <hi>Authentick</hi> Explication of the words of the <hi>Book,</hi> for these Delegates Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>St. Andrews,</hi> it is not to be doubted, but Mr. <hi>Andrew Melvil,</hi> at that time, <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal</hi> of the <hi>New College,</hi> was with them, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably they met, in that <hi>City,</hi> that he might be with them; for sure I am, it was not otherwise the most convenient place of the County for their Meeting: And having him with them, they had <hi>one,</hi> than whom, <hi>none</hi> on earth was capable of giving a more <hi>Authentick Sense</hi> of the words of the <hi>Book.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It were very easy to adduce more Acts of General Assemblies to this purpose: But I am affraid I have insisted too much on this subject already: In short then, the <hi>Groundless Fancy</hi> of the <hi>Divine Right</hi> of <hi>Popular Elections,</hi> is more properly ane <hi>Independent</hi> than a <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian</hi> principle. The <hi>English Presbyterians</hi> of the <hi>Provincial</hi> Assembly of <hi>London,</hi> wrote

zealously against it, in their <hi>Ius Divinum Ministerii Evangelici</hi>: It is truly inconsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with the <hi>Old</hi> Presbyterian <hi>Scheme</hi>; It obtain'd not generally amongst our <hi>Scottish</hi> Presbyterians till some years after 1638.

But he had just as much Reason for calling that <hi>Rout,</hi> a <hi>Parliament,</hi> or its <hi>Acts, Laws,</hi> as he had for making the suppressing of <hi>Popular Elections</hi> of Ministers, a <hi>just Cause</hi> for <hi>sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating</hi> from the Communion of a Church. Thus I have insisted on the <hi>Recessions</hi> of our present Presbyterian Brethren from the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of our Reformers about the <hi>publick worship</hi> of the Church and some of its <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendages</hi>; Perchance I have done it too te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diously; if so, I shall endeavour to dispatch what remains, more curtly.</p>
               <p n="3">III. They have also Deserted our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers in the <hi>Discipline</hi> of the Church; The particulars are too numerous to be insisted on; Let any man compare the <hi>two Books</hi> of <hi>Discipline</hi>; The <hi>First</hi> compiled by our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, Anno</hi> 1560; The <hi>Second,</hi> by the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> of the <hi>first Edition,</hi> and <hi>Ratified</hi> by <hi>Act</hi> of the <hi>General Assembly,</hi> holden in <hi>April</hi> 1581, and he shall find no scarcity of

differences; He shall find Alterations, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations, Oppositions, Contradictions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let him compare the Acts of Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies after the year 1580, with the Acts of Assemblies, before, and he shall find many more. Indeed,</p>
               <p>Our present Presbyterians have made not a few notorious Recessions from the <hi>Second,</hi> The <hi>Presbyterian Book</hi> of Discipline. To in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in a few.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Third Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Second Book</hi> of Discipline is thus Intituled, <hi>How the Persons that bear Ecclesiastical Function, are admitted to their Offices.</hi> This <hi>Chap.</hi> treats of such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in the general; The particular Orders of Pastors, Doctors, Elders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly treated of, in subsequent <hi>Chapter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</hi> This <hi>Third Chapter</hi> treating, thus, of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Officers in the general, makes two things necessary to the <hi>outward call, Election</hi> and <hi>Ordination,</hi> § 6. It defines ordination to be <hi>the separation and sanctifying of the Person appointed by God, and his Church, after that he is well tryed and found qualified.</hi> It ennumerates <hi>Fasting, Prayer, and imposition of hands</hi> of the <hi>Eldership,</hi> as the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of <hi>Ordination,</hi> § 11, 12. Now the whole Nation knows, no such thing as either Tryal, Fasting, or imposition of hands, are used by our present Presbyterians in the <hi>Ordination</hi> of <hi>Ruling El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Sixth Chapter</hi> is particularly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Ruling Elders,</hi> as contra-distinct from <hi>Pastors</hi> or <hi>Teaching Elders.</hi> And it determines
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:101025:294"/>
thus, concerning them, §. 3. <hi>Elders once Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully called to the Office, and having Gifts of God fit to exercise the same, may not leave it again:</hi> Yet nothing more ordinary with our present Presbyterians, than laying aside Ruling Elders, and reducing them to a state of <hi>Laicks</hi>; So that, Sure I am, if ever they were <hi>Presbyters,</hi> they come under <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> Censure <hi>(De Praescrip.)

               </p>
               <p>By the 9<hi>th</hi> §. of that same <hi>Chapter, It per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to them</hi> (these Ruling Elders) <hi>to assist the Pastor in examining those that come to the Lords Table, and in visiting the Sick.</hi> This Canon is not much in use, I think, as to the last part of it; as to the first, it is intirely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desuetude. Indeed some of them would be wondrously qualified for such ane Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Seventh Chapter</hi> is about <hi>Elderships and Assemblies.</hi> By § 2. <hi>Assemblies are of four sorts,</hi> viz. <hi>either of a particular Congregation, or of a Province, or a whole Nation, or all Christian Nations.</hi> Now of all these indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely it is affirmed, §. 5. <hi>In all Assemblies a Moderator should be chosen by common consent of the whole Brethren conveened</hi>; Yet no such thing observed in our <hi>Kirk-Sessions,</hi> which are the <hi>Congregational Assemblies</hi> spoken of § 2.

               </p>
               <p>The 14<hi>th Canon,</hi> in the same 7<hi>th Chapter</hi> is this, <hi>When we speak of Elders of particular Congregations, we mean not that every particular Parish Church can, or MAY have their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Elderships, especially to Landward, but we think three or four, more, or fewer particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches may have a common Eldership to them all, to judge their Ecclesiastical Causes. And Chapter</hi> 12. <hi>Canon</hi> 5. <hi>As to Elders, there would be in every Congregation, one, or more, appointed for censuring of manners, but not ane Assembly of Elders, except in Towns and Famous Places, where men of Iudgement and Ability may be had: And these to have a common Eldership placed amongst them, to treat of all things that concern the Congregations of whom they have the Oversight.</hi> But as the world goes now, every Parish, even in the Country, must have its own <hi>Eldership</hi>; and this Eldership must consist of such a number of the <hi>Sincerer sort,</hi> as may be able to out-vote all the <hi>Malignant</hi> Heritors, upon occasion; as when a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister is to be chosen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So long as there is a <hi>precise Plough-man,</hi> or a <hi>well-affected Webster,</hi> or a <hi>covenanted Cobbler,</hi> or so, to be found in the Parish, such a number must not be wanting. The standing of the <hi>Sect</hi> is the <hi>Supreme</hi> Law: The <hi>good cause</hi> must not <hi>suffer,</hi> tho' all the <hi>Canons</hi> of the <hi>Kirk</hi> should be put to <hi>shift</hi> for themselves.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The last thing I named, as that,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:101025:295"/>
wherein our present Presbyterians have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken the principles and sentiments of our Reformers, was <hi>the Government of the Church</hi>: But I have treated so fully of this, already, that 'tis needless to pursue it any farther. I shall only therefore, as ane Appendage to this, represent one very considerable <hi>Right</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> adhered to by our Reformers, but disclaim'd by our present Presbyterians. It is, her being the <hi>First</hi> of the <hi>three Estates</hi> of Parliament, and having <hi>vote</hi> in that <hi>great Council</hi> of the Nation.</p>
               <p>It is evident from the most Ancient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, and all the Authentick Monuments of the Nation, That the <hi>Church</hi> made still the <hi>First,</hi> of the <hi>Three Estates,</hi> in <hi>Scottish</hi> Parliaments, since there were Parliaments in <hi>Scotland.</hi> This had obtained, time out of mind, and was lookt upon as <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,</hi> in the Constitution of Parliaments, in the days of the Reformation. Our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers never so much as once dream'd, that this was a <hi>Popish Corruption</hi>: What <hi>Sophistry</hi> can make it <hi>such</hi>? They dream'd as little of its being unseemly or scandalous, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous, or inconvenient, or whatever, now adays, men are pleas'd to call it. On the contrary, they were clear for its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, as a very important <hi>Right</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> The <hi>First Book if Discipline, Head</hi> 8<hi>th,</hi> allowed Clergy-men <hi>to Assist the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when the same is called.</hi> 'Tis true <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwood</hi> both Corrupts the <hi>Text,</hi> here, and gives it a false <hi>Gloss.</hi> Instead of these words

Thus</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1567. when the <hi>Match</hi> was on foot, between the <hi>Queen</hi> and <hi>Bothwell,</hi> that it might seem to be concluded with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Authority, pains were taken to get the consent of the principal Nobility, by their susbcriptions.

                  <hi>All the Bishops, who were in the City, were also Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocated, and their subscriptions required,</hi> as <hi>Buchanan</hi> tells us. And</p>

               </p>
               <p>No Man, I think, will deny but the subsistence of the <hi>Ecclesiastical Estate,</hi> and their <hi>Vote</hi> in Parliament was confirmed and continued by the <hi>Agreement</hi> of <hi>Leith, Anno</hi> 1572. Indeed,</p>
               <p>When the Project for <hi>Parity</hi> amongst the Officers of the Church was set on <hi>Foot</hi> by <hi>Melvil, Anno</hi> 1575, and some of the Clergy were gained to his side, and they were using their utmost endeavours to have
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:101025:297"/>
Episcopacy overturned, it seems this was a main difficulty to them, a difficulty which did very much entangle and retard their purpose; This, I say, that the <hi>overturning Prelacy,</hi> was the overturning one of the <hi>three Estates</hi> of Parliament. This is evident not only from <hi>Boyd, Arch Bishop</hi> of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> his Discourse, to the General Assembly, <hi>Anno</hi> 1576. mentioned before, but also from the two Letters I have often named which were written to Mr. <hi>Beza:</hi> the one by the <hi>Lord Glamis, Anno</hi> 1576, or 1577, the <hi>other</hi> by Mr. <hi>Melvil, Anno</hi> 1579. Because they contribute so much light to the matter in hand, I shall once more resume them. <hi>Glamis</hi> was then <hi>Chancellor</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi>; It is manifest he wrote not indeliberately, or without advice: Undoubtedly he stated the Question, according to the <hi>sense,</hi> the <hi>Generality of People</hi> had, then, of it; Now he states it thus. <hi>Seeing every Church hath its own Pastor, and the Power of Pastors in the Church of Christ seems to be equal; The Question is whither the Office of Bishops be Necessary in the Church, for convocating these Pastors, when there is need; for Ordaining Pastors, and for Deposing them for just Causes? Or whither it be better, that the Pastors Acting in Parity, and subject to no Superiour Bishop, should choose Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified Men, for the Ministery, with consent of the Patron, and the People; and Censure, and Depose,</hi> &amp;c.? <hi>For Retaining Bishops we have these two Motives; One is, the stubbornenss and ungovernableness of the People, which cannot pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly

                  <hi>if they are not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awed by the Authority of these Bishops, in their visitations. The other is, that such is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the Monarchy</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Leges Regni longo usu &amp; invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rata con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suetudine Receptae.</note> 
                  <hi>which hath obtain'd time out of mind, that as often as the Parliament meets, for consulting about things pertaining to the safety of the Republick, nothing can be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined without the Bishops, who make the</hi> Third Estate <hi>of the Kingdom, which, to change or subvert, would be extremely perilous to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> So he, from which we may learn two things: The <hi>First</hi> is, a farther confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of what I have before asserted to have been the sentiment of these times con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Election of Pastors,</hi> namely that it was, that they should be <hi>Elected by the Clergy,</hi> and that <hi>the People</hi> should have no other <hi>Power</hi> than that of <hi>Consenting</hi>: The <hi>other</hi> is pat in Relation to our present busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, namely, that the <hi>Ecclesiastical Estate</hi> was judged <hi>Necessary,</hi> by the <hi>constitution</hi> of the <hi>Monarchy</hi>; It could not be wanting in Parliaments: It was to run the hazard of subverting the <hi>constitution,</hi> to think of <hi>altering</hi> it or <hi>turning</hi> it out of doors. And</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Melvil</hi>'s Letter is clearly to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: <hi>We have not ceased these five years to fight against Pseudepiscopacy (many of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity resisting us) and to press the severity of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline: We have presented unto his Royal Majesty, and three Estates of the Realm, both before, and now, in this Parliament, the form of Discipline, to be insert amongst the Acts, and to be confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by publick Authority: We have the Kings
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:101025:298"/>
mind bended towards us,</hi> (too far said, I am sure, if we may take that Kings own word for it) <hi>but many of the Peers against us: For they alledge, if Pseudepiscopacy be taken away, one of the Estates is pulled down: If Presbyteries be erected, the Royal Majesty is</hi> diminished, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'Tis true, <hi>Melvil</hi> himself, here, shews no great kindness for the <hi>third Estate</hi>: But that's no great matter; It was his <hi>humor</hi> to be <hi>singular</hi>; All I am concerned for, is the publick sentiment of the Nation; especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Nobility,</hi> which we have so plain, for the <hi>Necessity</hi> of the <hi>Ecclesiastical Estate,</hi> that nothing can be plainer. Nay.</p>
               <p>So indisputable was it, then, that this <hi>Ecclesiastical Estate</hi> was <hi>absolutely</hi> necessary by the <hi>constitution,</hi> that the Presbyterians them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves never called it in Question, never offered to advance such a <hi>Paradox</hi> as that, it might be abolished: After they had abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished Episcopacy by their Assembly 1580, the King sent several times to them, telling them,
<q>He could not want <hi>one</hi> of his <hi>three Estates.</hi> How would they provide him with ane <hi>Ecclesiastical Estate,</hi> now that they had abolished Bishops?</q>
Whoso pleases to Read <hi>Calderwood</hi> himself shall find this point frequently insisted on. What returns gave they? Did they ever in the least offer to return that the having ane <hi>Ecclesiastical Estate</hi> in Parliament was a <hi>Popish Corruption</hi>? That it was ane <hi>unwarrantable</hi> constitution? That it was <hi>not Necessary?</hi> Or that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution might be <hi>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="403" facs="tcp:101025:298"/>
No such thing entered their thoughts; On the contrary, they were still clear for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it; They had no inclination to part with such a valuable Right of the Church; Their Answer to the Kings Demands was still, <hi>one</hi> and <hi>the same; They were not against Churchmens having vote in Parliament; But none ought to vote in name of the Church without Commission from the Church.</hi> And this their sentiment they put in the very <hi>Second Book of Discipline,</hi> for these are word for word the <hi>seventeenth</hi> and <hi>eighteenth Articles</hi> of the <hi>eleventh Chapter.</hi>

<pb n="404" facs="tcp:101025:299"/>
these times, that the <hi>Ecclesiastical Estate</hi> was necessary, and that it could not be wanting without the notorious <hi>subversion</hi> of the <hi>constitution</hi> of Parliaments. Indeed, it was not only the sentiment of General Assemblies, whatever side, whither the <hi>Prelatical</hi> or the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> prevailed, but it was likewise the sentiment of <hi>all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments:</hi> It were easy to amass a great many Acts of a great many Parliaments to this purpose: I shall only instance in a few. Thus</p>
               <p>The <hi>eight Act Parl.</hi> 1. <hi>Iac.</hi> 6. holden in <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1567, appoints the <hi>Coronation Oath</hi> to be <hi>sworn</hi> by the <hi>King</hi>: And it is one of the <hi>Articles</hi> of that <hi>Oath, That he shall Rule the People committed to his Charge— according to the loveable Laws and Constitutions received in this Realm, no wise repugnant to the word of the Eternal God.</hi> Now, I think, this Parliament made no Question, but that the <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Law</hi> of the <hi>Constitution</hi> of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> was <hi>one</hi> of these <hi>Loveable Laws and Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> received in this Realm, no wise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the word of the Eternal God. Indeed</p>
               <p>The 24<hi>th Act</hi> of that same Parliament is this, word for word; <hi>Our Soveraign Lord, with advice and consent of his Regent, and the three Estates of Parliament, has Ratified, and Ratifies, all Civil Priviledges granted and given by our Soveraign Lords Predecessors to the Spiritual Estate of this Realm in all points, after the form and tenor thereof.</hi> Than which there
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:101025:299"/>
cannot be a more <hi>Authentick</hi> Commentary, for finding the true sense and meaning of the <hi>Coronation Oath,</hi> in Relation to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent purpose: I shall only adduce two more, but they are such two as are as good as two thousand.</p>
               <p>The 130<hi>th Act Parl.</hi> 8. <hi>Iac.</hi> 6. <hi>Anno</hi> 1584, is this word for word; <hi>The Kings Majesty considering the Honour and the Authority of his Supreme Court of Parliament, continued, past all memory of Man, unto these days, as constitute upon the free votes of the three Estates of this Ancient Kingdom; By whom the same, under God, has, ever, been upholden; Rebellious and Traiterous Subjects punished; the good and faithful preserved, and maintained; and the Laws and Acts of Parliament (by which all men are Govern'd) made and Established; and finding the Power, Dignity, and Authority of the said Court of Parliament, of late years, called in some doubt, at least, some</hi> (such as Mr. Andrew Melvil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) <hi>curiously travelling to have intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced some Innovations thereanent; His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties firm will and mind, always being, as it is yet; that the Honour, Authority and Dignity of his saids three Estates shall stand and continue in their own integrity, according to the Ancient and Loveable custome by-gone, without any alteration or diminution: THEREFORE, it is Statuted and Ordained by our Soveraign Lord, and his said three Estates, in this present Parliament, that none of his Leiges and Subjects, presume or take upon hand to impugne the Dignity, and the Authority of the said three Estates; or to seek or
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:101025:300"/>
procure the Innovation or Diminution, of the Power and Authority of the same three Estates, or any of them, in time coming, under the pain of Treason.</hi> Here I think the necessity of the three Estates, whereof, the <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> was ever reckoned the <hi>first,</hi> is asserted pretty fairly. Neither is this Act, so far as I know, formally repealed by any subsequent Act: And whosoever knows any thing of the History of these times, cannot but know that it was to crush the Designs set on foot, then, by some, for innovating about the <hi>Spiritual Estate,</hi> that this <hi>Act</hi> was formed.</p>
               <p>The other which I promised, is, <hi>Act</hi> 2. <hi>Parl.</hi> 18. <hi>Iac.</hi> 6. holden <hi>Anno</hi> 1606. Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled <hi>Act anent the Restitution of the Estate of Bishops.</hi> In the <hi>Preamble</hi> of which Act we are told, <hi>That of late, during his Majesties young years, and unsetled Estate, the Ancient and</hi> FUNDAMENTAL <hi>Policy, consisting in the Maintainance of the</hi> THREE E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STATES <hi>of Parliament, has been greatly impaired, and almost subverted; Specially by the Indirect Abolishing of the Estate of Bishops, by the Act of Annexation of the Temporality of Benefices to the Crown— That the said Estate of Bishops is Necessary Estate of the Parliament,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Such were the Sentiments of these times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So Essential was the <hi>Ecclesiastical Estate</hi> deem'd in the <hi>Constitution</hi> of <hi>Scottish</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And no wonder: For no man can doubt, but it was as early, as positively,
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:101025:300"/>
as incontestedly, as fundamentally and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterably in the constitution, as either the Estate of <hi>Nobles,</hi> or the Estate of <hi>Burrows.</hi> There is no Question, I think, about the <hi>Burrows</hi>: As for the Estate of <hi>Nobles,</hi> 'tis certain all <hi>Barons</hi> were still reckoned of the <hi>Nobless</hi>: The <hi>lesser Barons</hi> in Ancient times, were still reckoned a part of the <hi>Second,</hi> never a <hi>distinct Estate</hi> of Parliament; and they must quit all pretensions to be of the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bless,</hi> when they set up for a distinct Estate: Setting up for such, they are no more of the <hi>Nobility,</hi> than the <hi>Burrows.</hi> And then,</p>
               <p>If <hi>two</hi> Estates can <hi>vote out one,</hi> and make a Parliament without it; If they can split <hi>one</hi> into <hi>two,</hi> and so make up the <hi>three</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states: Why may not one split it self as well into <hi>three</hi>? Why may not the <hi>two</hi> parts of the splitted Estate joyn together and <hi>vote out</hi> the Estate of <hi>Burrows</hi>? Why may not the <hi>Nobility</hi> of the <hi>First Magnitude</hi> joyn with the <hi>Burrows</hi> to <hi>vote out</hi> the <hi>smaller Barons</hi>? Why may not the <hi>smaller Barons</hi> and the <hi>Burrows vote out</hi> the <hi>greater Nobility</hi>? After <hi>two</hi> have <hi>voted out one,</hi> why may not <hi>one,</hi> the more numerous, <hi>vote out</hi> the <hi>other,</hi> the less numerous? When the Parliament is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to <hi>one</hi> Estate why may not that <hi>one</hi> divide and <hi>one half</hi> vote out the <hi>other</hi>? And then <hi>subdivide</hi> and <hi>vote out,</hi> till the whole Parliament shall consist of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner for <hi>Rutherglen,</hi> or the <hi>Laird</hi> of or the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Crawford</hi>? Nay why may
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:101025:301"/>
not that <hi>one vote cut</hi> himself and leave the King without a Parliament? What a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous thing is it to shake Foundations? How doth it unhinge all things? How plainly doth it pave the way for that which our Brethren pretend to abhor so much, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Despotick Power,</hi> ane Absolute, and <hi>unlimited Monarchy</hi>? But enough of this.</p>
               <p>To conclude this point; there's nothing more notorious than that the <hi>Spiritual E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state</hi> was still judged <hi>Fundamental</hi> in the <hi>Constitution</hi> of Parliaments, was still <hi>called</hi> to Parliaments, did still <hi>Sit, Deliberate,</hi> and <hi>Vote</hi> in Parliaments till the year 1640, that it was turned out by the, then, Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians: And our present Presbyterians following their footsteps, have not only freely parted with, but forwardly rejected, that Ancient and valuable <hi>Right</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>: Nay, they have not only rejected it, but they declaim constantly against it as a <hi>Limb</hi> of <hi>Antichrist</hi> and what not? And have they not, herein, manifestly Deserted the undoubted principles and sentiments of our Reformers?</p>
               <p>It had been easy to have ennumerated a great many more of their notorious Reces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions from the principles of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>e. g.</hi> I might have insisted on their Deserting the principles and practices of our Reformers about the Constitution of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Assemblies; about Communion with the Church of <hi>England</hi>; about the Civil
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:101025:301"/>
Magistrates Power in Church Matters (justly or unjustly is not the present Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion) and many more things of considerable importance. Nay, which at first sight may seem a little strange, as much as they may seem to have swallowed down the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Rebellion and Arm'd Resistances against Lawful Soveraign Princes, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by our Reformers, yet even herein, there is difference; Considerable diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
               <p>Our Reformers, as much as they were inclined to Rebel against Kings, did yet maintain that they held their Crowns <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately</hi> of God. <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> in his <hi>Sermon</hi> preached on the 19<hi>th</hi> of <hi>August</hi> 1565, and afterwards published, hath this plain posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>That it is neither birth, Influence of Stars,</hi> ELECTION OF PEOPLE, <hi>Force of Arms, nor, finally, whatsoever can be comprehended under the Power of nature, that maketh the distinction between the Superiour Power, and the Inferior, or that doth Establish the Royal Throne of Kings; But it is the only and perfect Ordinance of God, who willeth his Terror, Power and Majesty, in a part, to shine in the Thrones of Kings and in the Faces of Iudges,</hi> &amp;c. Neither was this only his private sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent.</p>
               <p>The 24<hi>th Article</hi> of the <hi>Confession of Faith,</hi> compiled by our Reformers, and Ratified by Act of Parliament, is every whit as plain and Decretory; For there, <hi>They Profess to believe that Empires, Kingdoms, Dominions
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:101025:302"/>
and Cities are Distincted and Ordained by God: That the Powers and Authorities therein, are Gods Holy Ordinance; That Persons placed in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity are to be Loved, Honoured, Feared, and holden in most Reverend Estimation, because, they are Gods Lieutenants, in whose Session God sits, as Iudge; to whom, by God, is given the Sword,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That therefore whosoever deny unto Kings, their Aid, Counsel, or Comfort, while they vigilantly, travel in the executing of their Office, they deny their help, support and Counsel to God, who, by the presence of his Lieutenant, craveth it of them.</hi> So it was professed by our Reformers: How this principle could consist with their practices, is none of my present concerns. That is no more than to shew how our Presbyterian Brethren have deserted them in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: Now</p>
               <p>Our Presbyterian Brethren make <hi>Kings,</hi> as <hi>such,</hi> not <hi>Gods,</hi> but the <hi>Peoples</hi> creatures, by consequence, not <hi>Gods,</hi> but the <hi>Peoples</hi> Lieutenants; The <hi>People</hi> sets them on their Thrones; They have their <hi>Power</hi> from the <hi>People</hi>; They are the <hi>Peoples Trustees</hi>; They are accountable to the <hi>People</hi>; So that <hi>whosoever denys his Aid, Counsel or Comfort to them, while they vigilantly travel in executing their Office,</hi> in true Logick can be said to deny them <hi>only</hi> to the <hi>People.</hi> Even here then there is this great difference, our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers maintain'd <hi>one good principle</hi> in Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Soveraign Powers: Our present Presbyterians have even rejected that <hi>one</hi>
                  <pb n="411" facs="tcp:101025:302"/>
good principle. 'Tis true indeed, our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers seem to have been inconsequential in substituting Rebellious practices in the retinue of ane Orthodox principle; And our Presbyterian Brethren seem to be conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quential in having their principle and their practice of a piece; But doth this mend the matter? Nothing, as I take it; for all ends here, That our Reformers believed <hi>Right,</hi> tho they practiced <hi>Wrong.</hi> But our Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Brethren are altogether <hi>Wrong</hi>; They neither believe, nor practice <hi>Right.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, I say, it had been no difficult task to have instanced in many more of our <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Innovations; But the taste I have given, I think, is sufficient for my purpose; For laying together so many <hi>unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable</hi> Innovations, so many palpable and notorious Recessions from the principles and practices of our Reformers, as I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; and these in so weighty and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant matters, as the <hi>Doctrine, Worship, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, Government,</hi> and <hi>Rights</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> I may fairly leave it to the world, to judge, if our Brethren have just reason to insist so much upon the principles of our Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or to entitle themselves (as, on all occasions they are so sollicitous and forward to do) the only <hi>Real</hi> and <hi>Genuine Successors</hi> of our Reformers.</p>
               <p>Neither is this all that may justly <hi>pinch</hi> them. They have not only Receded from our <hi>Scottish</hi> Reformers, but from all other <hi>Reformed Churches.</hi> What <hi>Reformed Church</hi>
                  <pb n="412" facs="tcp:101025:303"/>
in <hi>Christendom</hi> maintains all the Articles of the <hi>Westminster Confession</hi>? What <hi>Reformed Church</hi> requires the profession of so many Articles, not <hi>mainly</hi> for <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Vnity,</hi> but as a <hi>Test</hi> of <hi>Orthodoxy?</hi> What <hi>Reformed Church,</hi> except our <hi>Kirk,</hi> maintains the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Institution</hi> of <hi>Parity</hi> among the <hi>Pastors</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> so, as to make all kind of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy</hi> simply <hi>unlawful</hi>? What <hi>Reformed Church,</hi> except the <hi>Scottish,</hi> wants a <hi>Liturgy</hi>?

What <hi>Transmarine Reformed Church,</hi> that is not <hi>Lutheran,</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns the <hi>Communion</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi> What <hi>Reformed Church</hi> maintains the <hi>Divine institution</hi> and the <hi>Indispensible Necessity</hi> of <hi>Ruling Elders</hi> in contradistinction to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors</hi>? What <hi>Reformed Church</hi> maintains the <hi>Divine institution</hi> and the <hi>unalienable Right</hi> of <hi>Popular</hi> Elections of <hi>Pastors?</hi> What <hi>Reformed Church</hi> ever offered to maintain that the <hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> by <hi>Bishops,</hi> or a publick <hi>Liturgy,</hi> or <hi>want</hi> of Ruling Elders, distinct from Pastors; or <hi>choosing</hi> Pastors, otherwise, than by the <hi>voices</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> or <hi>using</hi> some <hi>innocent</hi> and <hi>unforbidden</hi> Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, as circumstances or Appendages of Divine worship, or <hi>observing</hi> some <hi>days</hi> besides <hi>Sundays,</hi> were sufficient grounds for <hi>breaking</hi> the <hi>Peace</hi> of a Church, and <hi>dividing</hi> her <hi>Unity,</hi> and setting up <hi>Altar</hi> against <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi>? What <hi>Reformed Church</hi> was ever <hi>Bound</hi>
                  <pb n="413" facs="tcp:101025:303"/>
by her <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Canons</hi> to require of all such as she admitted to the participation of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> the <hi>Subscription</hi> of such <hi>terms</hi> as are contained in the <hi>Solemn League and Covenant</hi>? What <hi>Reformed Church</hi> doth not satisfy her self with the Profession of the <hi>Faith</hi> contain'd in the <hi>Apostles Creed</hi> at <hi>Baptism</hi>? What <hi>Reformed Church</hi> requires the Profession of such a vast, such a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berless number of Articles and Propositions as are contained in the <hi>Westminster Confession,</hi> and the <hi>larger</hi> and <hi>shorter Catechisms,</hi> of all those, whom they <hi>receive</hi> into the <hi>Catholick Church?</hi> What is this less, than to make all these Propositions <hi>Necessary terms</hi> of their <hi>Communion</hi>? And how impossible is it, at this Rate, ever to think of a <hi>Catholick</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion among Christians? Is not this, <hi>needlessly,</hi> and, by consequence, very <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minally</hi> and <hi>Vnchristianly,</hi> to lay a <hi>Fund</hi> for unavoidable, unextinguishable and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting <hi>Schisms</hi>? Neither yet is this all the Misery: For</p>
               <p>Considering the <hi>Measures</hi> our Brethren <hi>steer</hi> by, there is little ground to <hi>hope</hi> that they shall ever turn <hi>weary</hi> of Innovating. The first <hi>Brood</hi> of Presbyterians, the old <hi>Melvilians,</hi> inverted (as I have told) almost the whole <hi>Scheme</hi> of our Reformers: The next <hi>Birth,</hi> the <hi>thirty-eight-men,</hi> made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Recessions from their <hi>Progenitors,</hi> the <hi>Melvilians:</hi> The present <hi>Production</hi> have forsaken <hi>most</hi> of the <hi>Measures</hi> of the <hi>thirty-eight-men:</hi> And what hopes of their <hi>fixing?</hi>
                  <pb n="414" facs="tcp:101025:304"/>
When shall it be proper for them to say, we have done <hi>innovating</hi>? Hitherto we have <hi>innovated,</hi> but we will <hi>innovate</hi> no farther? How dreadful a thing is it for men to give loose Reins to the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Innovation</hi>! But I shall not pursue this farther: I know the temper of our Brethren; 'tis but too too pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, they may impute it to <hi>Malice</hi> or <hi>Revenge,</hi> or ane <hi>imbittered Spirit,</hi> to some <hi>ill</hi> thing or another, that I have pursued this matter so far; But if they shall, I pray, <hi>God</hi> forgive them, for they are injurious to me. The principle which prompted me to represent these things, was truly, that of <hi>Fraternal Correption.</hi> My main Design was to <hi>soften,</hi> not <hi>irritate</hi> them; not to <hi>exasperate</hi> them, but to bring them to a more <hi>Manageable</hi> and <hi>Considering temper.</hi> For</p>
               <p>I can, and do, sincerely, protest, that it is daily the earnest desire of my Soul, <hi>that all men may be saved and come to the knowledge of the Truth.</hi> I wish all <hi>Men Christians,</hi> and I wish all <hi>Christians, Christians Indeed</hi>; In a special manner I wish our Presbyterian Brethren, and we, may, yet, be so much Honoured and blessed of <hi>God,</hi> that in the <hi>sincerity</hi> of <hi>Brotherly kindness,</hi> we may be all <hi>Vnited</hi> in <hi>one Holy Communion.</hi> I wish we may all earnestly <hi>contend,</hi> with all Christian <hi>forbearance, fellow-feeling,</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> as becometh the members of the <hi>one Church,</hi> whereof <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> is the <hi>Head,</hi> to have the poor, <hi>divided desolated Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi>
                  <pb n="415" facs="tcp:101025:304"/>
restored to that Peace, Purity and Unity, That Order, Government and Stability, which our <hi>Blessed Master</hi> hath <hi>instituted</hi> and <hi>commanded.</hi> May <hi>Almighty God inspire</hi> us all with the <hi>Spirit</hi> of his <hi>Son,</hi> that our <hi>hearts</hi> being <hi>purified</hi> by ane <hi>Humble</hi> and a <hi>Lively Faith,</hi> the <hi>Faith that worketh by Love,</hi> and our <hi>Lives</hi> Reformed according to the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>great purposes</hi> of our <hi>Holy Religion,</hi> we may be all <hi>unanimously</hi> and <hi>dutifully disposed,</hi> for so Great, so Glorious, so Desireable a <hi>Mercy.</hi> And with this I end this <hi>Fifth En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry.</hi> And now,</p>
               <p>I think, I have competently answered the ends of my undertaking, which was to <hi>Examine</hi> this <hi>Article</hi> of our new <hi>Claim of Right,</hi> and try its firmness and solidity. I think, I have comprized, in these <hi>five En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries,</hi> every thing that is material in it, considered, either in it self, or as it supports the great alterations have been, lately, made in the Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi> It might have been more narrowly sifted; and sifted more narrowly it might have been found lyable to many more exceptions. For instance,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It may seem somewhat surprizing that such ane Article should have been put into a <hi>Scottish</hi> Claim of Right; That it should have been made so <hi>seemingly Fundamental,</hi> at least, in the <hi>Constitution</hi> of the <hi>Scottish Monarchy,</hi> which is so famous and has been so much renowned for its Antiquity. Was ever such ane <hi>Article</hi> in a <hi>Scottish</hi> Claim of Right before? No Man, I think, will say
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:101025:305"/>
it was in the <hi>Original Contract</hi> made with <hi>Fergus</hi> the <hi>First</hi> (if any Original Contract was made with him) for if he was, he was advanced to the Throne, 330 years before our <hi>Saviours Birth,</hi> if we may believe our Historians: And, I think, it was not ane <hi>Article</hi> in the <hi>Original Contract,</hi> then that the Christian Church should be so or so Governed. Few men, I think, will say, it was part of the <hi>Original Contract</hi> made with any <hi>Scottish</hi> King before the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</hi> No man can produce any such <hi>Article</hi> in any <hi>Original Contract,</hi> made with King <hi>Iames</hi> the <hi>Sixth,</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>First,</hi> or King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Second,</hi> unless it was the <hi>Solemn League and Covenant,</hi> or the <hi>Act</hi> of the <hi>West Kirk.</hi> It cannot be said that it was in any <hi>Original Contract,</hi> made with King <hi>Iames</hi> the <hi>Seventh,</hi> for all the Nation knows it was <hi>Declared</hi> by the <hi>Meeting of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,</hi> that he <hi>forfeited his Right to the Crown</hi> for having made no <hi>Original Contracts.</hi> These are all the real or pretended Kings we have had since the Reformation, till the late Revolution. Is not this <hi>Article,</hi> therefore, a <hi>New Fundamental,</hi> added to the <hi>Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>Ancient Scottish Monarchy</hi>? This is all upon the supposition that it is, truly, a <hi>part</hi> of our new <hi>Claim of Right.</hi> Tho' in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,</p>
               <p n="2">2. It may be made a Question, whither it can be justly called a <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>Claim of Right</hi>? It is very possible for <hi>one</hi> thing to be <hi>in</hi> another without being <hi>part</hi> of that
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:101025:305"/>
                  <hi>other.</hi> And one would think, this <hi>Article</hi> lookt very unlike a <hi>part of</hi> a Claim of Right: It seems not to run in the <hi>stile</hi> that is <hi>proper</hi> for <hi>Claims of Right:</hi> 'Tis certain, it runs not in the <hi>stile</hi> of the <hi>rest</hi> of the <hi>Articles.</hi> All the rest of the Articles tell us either what is <hi>contrary</hi> to <hi>Law,</hi> or what are the undoubted <hi>Rights</hi> of the <hi>People:</hi> This <hi>Article</hi> imports nothing like either the <hi>one</hi> or the <hi>other.</hi> It only <hi>Declares</hi> Prelacy to be a <hi>Grievance, &amp;c.</hi> This doth not say that it was <hi>contrary</hi> to <hi>Law:</hi> For <hi>Laws</hi> themselves may <hi>be,</hi> and actually <hi>were</hi> Declared to be <hi>Grievances</hi> by the <hi>Meeting of Estates,</hi> in another paper; And the Articles Declaring that <hi>Prelacy</hi> ought to be <hi>Abolished,</hi> is ane Argument that it <hi>subsisted</hi> by <hi>Law,</hi> and it was abolished as <hi>subsisting</hi> by <hi>Law,</hi> for the <hi>Act</hi> which abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished it <hi>Repealed</hi> the <hi>Laws</hi> by which it <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted.</hi> Neither is <hi>Prelacy</hi> declared by the <hi>Article</hi> to be <hi>contrary</hi> to the <hi>Rights,</hi> but only to the <hi>Inclinations</hi> of the <hi>People</hi>; and I think, it requires no <hi>Depth</hi> of <hi>Metaphysical precision</hi> to distinguish between <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> Indeed, it seems obvious to any body that this <hi>Article</hi> had had its <hi>situation</hi> more properly and <hi>naturally</hi> amongst the <hi>Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> which were digested in another paper; and therefore, I say, being only <hi>praeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally,</hi> and by apparent <hi>force,</hi> thrust into the <hi>Claim of Right,</hi> it may be made a Question, whither its being, <hi>so,</hi> there, be enough to make it <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>Claim of Right</hi>? Or whither its <hi>nature</hi> should not be regarded
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:101025:306"/>
rather than its <hi>post.</hi> And, it should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed to have no more weight than if it had been <hi>Regularly</hi> ranked in its own <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>? But such Questions are too hard for me, and more proper for Lawyers to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine. Neither shall I meddle</p>
               <p n="3">3. With many other obvious difficulties which must necessarily result from this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, being made truly a part of the <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Contract,</hi> between King and People; Such as its making the <hi>settlement</hi> of the <hi>Crown</hi> to depend, not on <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Inheritance,</hi> or <hi>Proximity</hi> of <hi>Blood,</hi> or any such Ancient, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, Solid, Hereditary Title, but on the, every day, <hi>changeable Inclinations</hi> of the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> for these are the main <hi>fund</hi> of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, and by the supposition, the Article is <hi>intrinsecal</hi> and <hi>fundamental</hi> to the <hi>present settlement.</hi> This, I say, (and many more such, which might be easily named) seems a very considerable difficulty that might be urged on such a supposition: But I shall not insist on them. Farther,</p>
               <p n="4">4. Besides all these <hi>Awkward</hi> exceptions, whither it is, or is not, a <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>Claim of Right,</hi> the <hi>stile</hi> of it might deserve to be considered: Particularly, that Phrase, of <hi>Prelacy's being a great and insupportable Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance and Trouble to the Nation.</hi> 'Tis true I have in my <hi>Third Enquiry, guessed</hi> at its meaning; But I do sincerely acknowledge it was but <hi>guessing</hi>; and even yet, I can do no more but <hi>guess</hi> about it. Doth it not, at first sight, appear a little too <hi>big</hi> and
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:101025:306"/>
                  <hi>swelling</hi>? Is it not hard to find, for it, a <hi>certain</hi> and determined <hi>sound</hi>? To call a thing a <hi>great and insupportable Grievance and Trouble,</hi> seems a little too <hi>flashy</hi> and <hi>fanciful.</hi> Is it not liker to the <hi>flights</hi> of the Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians design'd for <hi>popular amusement,</hi> than to the plain, solid significant <hi>stile</hi> which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the Grand <hi>Council</hi> of a Nation? For <hi>Original-Contract,</hi> and <hi>Claim-of Right-makers</hi>?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Seeing, 'tis plain, the Article was formed for the abolition of <hi>Prelacy,</hi> and the Introduction of <hi>Presbytery,</hi> it seems a little strange, that such ane important Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the Church, should have been founded on such <hi>Vntheological Reasons.</hi> It seems to lye at the bottom of this Article, that the <hi>Government</hi> of the Church is <hi>Ambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory</hi> and <hi>Indifferent</hi>; That there is nothing of <hi>Divine Institution</hi> about it; that the <hi>State</hi> may alter it when it pleases; and, as it thinks expedient, set up, Alternatively, either <hi>Prelacy</hi> or <hi>Parity,</hi> or neither, but plain <hi>Erastianism,</hi> if it has a mind for it. These are suppositions, which, I think, ought not to be very relishing even to our Presbyterian Brethren: Tho hitherto they only have got advantage by the Article, yet it seems not <hi>honourable</hi> for their <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> to stand on such a foot, nor can they be secure but that it may be very soon turn'd down again. Tho', in consequence of this,</p>
               <p n="6">6. By <hi>G. R</hi>'s Measures, the <hi>Framers</hi> of
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:101025:307"/>
the Article, were <hi>incapable</hi> of <hi>Voting</hi> about the Establishment of any <hi>Form</hi> of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Church: For they proceeded in <hi>voting</hi> this <hi>Article,</hi> clearly upon the <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> of <hi>Indifferency.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Vind. ad Let. 3. §. 4.</note> But according to him as I have already observed, such, tho' they may be persons both Religious and Learned, are not to be brought into the <hi>Reckoning,</hi> with those who have <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>vote</hi> about <hi>Church-Government.</hi> Indeed according to his <hi>Scheme,</hi> the Nation, by this Article, is brought to a very lamentable state. For thus ane Article is <hi>imposed</hi> on it, by such as had no <hi>Right,</hi> no <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>impose</hi> it, because they have fairly declared themselves to be for the <hi>indifferency</hi> of particular <hi>forms</hi> of Church Government. And yet by another <hi>proposition,</hi> in his <hi>Scheme,</hi> this <hi>Article</hi> cannot be <hi>altered</hi>: For this is one of his <hi>positions,</hi> that the <hi>Deed</hi> of a <hi>Meeting</hi> of <hi>Estates</hi> is to be interpreted the <hi>Deed</hi> of the <hi>whole Nation</hi>: From which it follows by unavoidable consequence, that the <hi>whole Nation,</hi> hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter must be <hi>excluded</hi> from <hi>voting</hi> about the Government of the Church: For the <hi>whole Nation</hi> (even Presbyterians themselves not excepted) by Establishing this Article have declared themselves <hi>indifferent,</hi> as to the <hi>Species</hi> of Church Government. Now as I said, is not this a Lamentable state to which the Nation is reduced? It lyes under the burden of ane ill-contrived Article, imposed by such as were not <hi>Competent,</hi> had no <hi>Right,</hi> to <hi>impose</hi> it; and yet it must lye,
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:101025:307"/>
                  <hi>Remedilessly,</hi> under this <hi>burden,</hi> because those who <hi>imposed</hi> it, by <hi>imposing</hi> it, while they were not <hi>Competent</hi> nor <hi>Qualified</hi> for <hi>imposing</hi> it, have rendred the <hi>whole</hi> Nation <hi>incompetent,</hi> and <hi>unqualified</hi> for <hi>altering</hi> it, or freeing it self of such a <hi>burden.</hi> Was ever Nation so miserably intricated? But enough of <hi>G. R.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These, I say, and several other things, might have been farther considered and insisted on: But having already answered the ends of my undertaking, I shall proceed no farther: I conclude with this.</p>
               <p>If these Papers shall have the Fortune to come to the hand of any <hi>Scottish</hi> Noblemen or Gentlemen, and if they shall think it worth their while to peruse them, I earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estly beg one piece of Justice from them: It is, that they would not apprehend, I had the least intention or inclination to cast <hi>disgrace</hi> on such of them as concurred either to the <hi>framing</hi> or the <hi>voting</hi> of this <hi>Article.</hi> I love my native Country: I <hi>honour</hi> all Persons of <hi>true</hi> honour in it: I have no where <hi>impugned</hi> the <hi>Authority</hi> of those who Established this Article; I had no such pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; My undertaking required no such performance; All I designed was to do ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to my Countrey, according to my poor abilities: I cannot think any Ingenuous person, any person of true honour, can deny, that it is good service done to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to tell them truth <hi>Civilly,</hi> and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour <hi>Dutifully</hi> to recover them from mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes,
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:101025:308"/>
if they labour under any. We are all fallible, and capable of taking things by the wrong handle; and a very <hi>mean</hi> Person may be sometimes a seasonable <hi>Monitor.</hi> If I have said any thing <hi>false</hi> or <hi>amiss,</hi> I crave all men pardon: But if I have advanced nothing but <hi>Truth,</hi> if I have done nothing but <hi>Iustice</hi> to this <hi>Article</hi> (and I protest se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously, I think, I have done no more) I cannot think it will be <hi>Iust</hi> or <hi>Generous,</hi> in any Man, to harbour <hi>Picques</hi> against me, for doing what I have done; The <hi>Genuine</hi> use (I am sure it is <hi>Genuine</hi>) I wish, my Countrey-men, of whatever <hi>Station</hi> or <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,</hi> may make of my <hi>Examination</hi> of this <hi>Article,</hi> is, to suffer themselves to be put to thinking by it, and Enquiring whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there may not be some other <hi>Articles,</hi> every whit, of as great importance to the Nation, in our new <hi>Claim of Right,</hi> as <hi>ill-founded</hi> as this; And if any such are found, to contribute their joynt endeavours, as becometh <hi>true Scottishmen</hi> and <hi>good Christians</hi> to have all <hi>Righted.</hi>
