            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

&amp; 19. 5, 9. Rev. 21. 8. &amp; 22. 15.</bibl>
            <p>IN 1662. Dr. <hi>Boreman</hi> of <hi>Trinity-Colledge</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> Publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Book against me, as having written to Dr. <hi>Hill</hi> against
<hi>Physical-Predetermination to Sin;</hi> and in it saith, That it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
<hi>That I kill'd a Man with my own Hand in cold Blood; and
if it be not true, I am not the first that have been wronged.</hi> The Man,
though promoted to the Charge of this Parish, St. <hi>Giles in the Fields,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:45244:2"/>
was accounted so weak, (for bearing his Ministry, and saying he was
suspended some Years before he died) that I thought it vain to take
publick Notice of his Words; neither imagining whence he had
them, nor ever hearing of them before.</p>
            <p>But a few Weeks before the late <hi>Plot</hi> was reported, one Mr. <hi>P.</hi>
came to me, and told me, That at the Coffee-House in <hi>Fullers-Rents,</hi>
where <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Protectants</hi> used familiarly to meet; he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking
the <hi>Papists</hi> to Answer my Books, or to Dispute with me, was
answered by a Gentleman of this Parish, said to be of the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> That [<hi>Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>had kill'd a Man in cold Blood with his
own Hand.</hi>] Mr. <hi>P.</hi> provoked him by a Wager to make it good.
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e refusing the Wager, was told, He should hear of it publickly,
unless he would ask me Forgiveness, After some time, the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
came to me with Mr. <hi>Tasborough,</hi> (since imprisoned, as is known)
and with great Civility, ask't me Forgiveness. He was the Son of
a Knight, and Judge, of my Acquaintance; and had an Aunt, that
had been my very dear Friend. I told him, That Slandering is so
common, and asking Forgiveness so rare, that I took it for a note
of great Ingenuity in him; and, as I must forgive all Men as a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
so I could easily forgive any wrong to one related to such a
Friend of mine. He told me, He was resolved openly to confess his
Fault, and to vindicate me on all Occasions.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, at the same Coffee-House, he openly declared his
Repentance. Upon which, Mr. <hi>P.</hi> tells me, That Mr. <hi>G.</hi> an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
Lawyer, Brother to the Lady <hi>Ab.</hi> was displeased, and said,
He would prove the thing true by many Witnesses: (And, saith
Mr. <hi>P.</hi> the Story among some of them was, That a Tinker did
beat his Kettle at my Door, and being disturbed by him, I pistoll'd
him, and was tryed for my Life at <hi>Worcester.</hi>) Mr. <hi>P.</hi> said, He
provoked Mr. <hi>G.</hi> to lay a Wager on it: And he refusing, was
told, [<hi>Then he should hear of it in Westminster-Hall.</hi>] Upon this,
saith Mr. <hi>P.</hi> his Fellow-<hi>Catholicks</hi> ingenuously resolved to disown
him, unless he would ask Forgiveness; which he being unwilling to
come to me to do, Mr. <hi>P.</hi> saith, He at last performed before <hi>Him,</hi>
and Capt. <hi>Edmund Hampden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>All this being done without my Knowledge (till after,) I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
it to Mr.</hi> Iohn Humfrey: Why (<hi>saith he</hi>) I did twelve Years
ago hear Dr. <hi>Allestry,</hi> now Regius-Professor in <hi>Oxford,</hi> say the like,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat he could not think well of that Man, that had kill'd a Man in cold
Blood with his own Hand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:45244:2"/>
I little regarded all the rest: But Dr. <hi>Allestry</hi> had many Years
been my old School Fellow; many a time I had taught him; and he
was the best at Learning, and of the honestest Disposition of any
Boy that eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> I knew; and I thought, If <hi>Parties</hi> could draw such as
he into such Guilt, there was little Account to be made of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
or History of Men, if once they fell into different Factions.
Wherefore I wrote to him what Mr. <hi>Humfrey</hi> told me, and received
from him this honest ingenuous Letter, which I here annex.</p>
            <p>And as to all this Story, I do here solemnly profess, That I never
killed, wounded, or hurt any Man in my Life, (save one Man,
whose Leg I hurt with playful Wrestling, when I was a Boy, and
once or twice boxing with School-Boys, and correcting Lads when
I was one Year a School-Master.) Nor in all the Wars, or in my Life,
did I ever see any other kill any Man, save one; and that was at the
same Bickering, (about Forty of a Side) when <hi>Iennings</hi> was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
While they were Fighting with him in one great Field, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in another near the House, saw the Souldiers offering Quarter
to a Foot-Souldier, and promising him Safety, if he would lay down
his Musket; which he did not, but struck at them; and Captain
<hi>Holdich</hi> shot him dead: And it proved after to be a <hi>Welsh</hi>-man, that
understood not <hi>English;</hi> which grieved them when they knew it.</p>
            <p>I have gone the next day where Fights have been, and seen many
dead, when I had nothing to do with the Armies of either Part.
But I never saw any, to my Knowledge, kill or hurt any Man, but
this one.</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>

                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> Must profess sincerely, That I cannot recollect I ever said
such Words of you to Mr. <hi>Humfrey,</hi> as it seems he does affirm
I did: But yet I cannot but acknowledge, it is very possible, that
I related, (and may be, to Him) That I had heard, you kill'd a
Man in cold Blood: Since I very well remember, that above
Thirty Years since, at the End of the War, I heard that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45244:3"/>
spoken before Company; and with this farther Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
that it was a Souldier, who had been a Prisoner some
Hours. Now this Report relating to the Wars, in which (I fear)
such Things were no great Rarities, and from my very tender
Youth, I having not had the least Converse with you, nor likely-of
any for the future, did not therefore apprehend, at present,
any Concern or Occasion of inquiring, whether it were true; of
which, upon that confident Asseveration, I did make no doubt.
And I took so little thought of laying up the Relation, that I
protest to you, as in the Presence of Almighty <hi>God,</hi> it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for me to recover, who made up that Company in which I
heard it, or from whom I heard it: And I wonder, how it came
into my Mind, to say that I had heard it, so long after. But
however, though it be some Ease to me, to believe the late Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
of it, do not come from my relating so long since that I
heard it, neither are likely to receive any Confirmation from it,
unless it be made more Publick than I have made it; yet I do
profess, it is a great Affliction to me, to have spoken that, though
but as a Report, which (it seems) was a Slander, (for so I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it, upon your Asseveration) and not having endeavoured
to know whether it were true. And, as I have beg'd <hi>God's</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness
of it; so I heartily desire, You will forgive me: And
if I could direct my self to any other way of Satisfaction, I would
give it. This is the whole Account I can give of this Matter;
to which I shall only add, That I am,</p>

            <p>II. In the Preface to the Life of Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> are these Words.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> may be pleased to call to mind, what was done to one Major
<hi>Jennings,</hi> the last War, in that Fight that was between <hi>Lyndsel</hi> and <hi>Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
in the County of <hi>Salop;</hi> where the <hi>Kings</hi> Party, having unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
the worst of the Day, the poor Man was stript almost naked, and left
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45244:3"/>
for dead in the Field: But Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and one Lieutenant <hi>Hurdman,</hi>
taking their Walk among the wounded and dead Bodies, perceived some Life
left in the Major, and <hi>Hurdman</hi> run him through the Body in cold Blood;
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> all the while looking on, and taking off with his own Hand, the
<hi>Kings</hi> Picture from about his Neck; telling him, as he was swiming in his
Goar, That he was a Popish Rogue, and that was his Crucifix: Which Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
was kept by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> for many Years, till it was got from him (but
not without much difficulty) by one Mr. <hi>Somerfield,</hi> who then lived with
<hi>Sir Thomas Rous,</hi> and generously restored it to the poor man, now alive
at <hi>Wick</hi> near <hi>Pershore</hi> in <hi>Worcestershire,</hi> although at the Fight suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to be dead: being, after the Wounds given him, drag'd up and down the
Field by the merciless Souldiers; Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> approving of the inhumani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
by feeding his Eyes with so bloody, and so barbarous a Spectacle.</p>
            <p>I <hi>Thomas Jennings,</hi> Subscribe to the truth of this Narrative abovemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned;
and have hereunto put my Hand and Seal this second Day of <hi>March
1682. Thomas Jennings.</hi> Signed and Sealed, <hi>March</hi> 2. 1682. in the
Presence of <hi>John Clark,</hi> Minister of <hi>Wick, Thomas Dacke.</hi> Published
by <hi>George Vernon,</hi> Minister.</p>
            <p>The like was before Published by <hi>Roger L'Strange.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I do not think Major <hi>Iennings</hi> knowingly made this Lye, but
was directed by some bodies Report, and my sending him the <hi>Medal.</hi>
I do solemnly protest, 1. That, to my Knowledge, I never saw Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
<hi>Iennings:</hi> 2. That I never saw Man wound, hurt, strip, or touch
him: 3. That I never spake a word to him, much less any word here
affirmed: 4. That I neither took the Picture from about his Neck,
nor saw who did it: 5. That I was not in the Field, when it was done:
6. That I walked not among any wounded or dead; nor heard of
any kild, but the one Man before-mentioned. 7. That the Picture was
never got from me with difficulty. But that this is the Truth: The
<hi>Parliament</hi> had a few Men in <hi>Longford</hi> House, and the <hi>King</hi> at <hi>Lynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,</hi>
about a Mile and a half a-sunder; who used oft to skirmish, and
dare each other in the Fields between: My Innocent Father being
Prisoner at <hi>Lyndsel,</hi> and I being at <hi>Longford,</hi> resolved not to go
thence till he was delivered. I saw the Souldiers go out, as they oft
did, and in another Field discerned them to meet and Fight: I knew
not, that they had seen <hi>Iennings;</hi> but, being in the House, a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
shewed a small <hi>Medal</hi> of Guilt Silver, bigger than a Shilling;
and told us, That he wounded <hi>Iennings,</hi> and took his Coat, and
took that <hi>Medal</hi> from about his Neck: I bought it of him for 18. <hi>d.</hi>
no one offering him more. And some Years after (the first time that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45244:4"/>
I heard where he was, freely desired Mr. <hi>Somerfield</hi> to give it him from
me, that had never seen him; supposing it was a mark of Honour,
which might be useful to him. And now all these Lies, are all the
Thanks that ever I had.</p>

brought in the <hi>King,</hi> besides your self? Wh. Mr. <hi>Hunt,</hi> the Author
of the Conformists Plea, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and who not?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tor.</hi> Prethee ask Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> If he knows who it was, that went with
five or six more of his own Cloth and Character, to General <hi>Monk,</hi> upon
his coming up to <hi>London,</hi> in 1659; and finding a great deal of Company
with him, told his Excellency, That he found his time was precious, and so
would not trouble him with many Words: But as they were of great weight,
so he hoped, they would make an answerable Impression on him: I hear a
Report, Sir, <hi>(saith he)</hi> that you have some thoughts of calling back the
<hi>King;</hi> but it is my Sense, and the Sense of these Gentlemen here with me,
that it is a thing you ought not to do on any termes: For Prophanness is so
inseparable from the Royal Party, that if ever you bring the <hi>King</hi> back the
Power of Godliness will most certainly depart from this Land.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Dr. <hi>Manton</hi> (and whether any other, I remember not) went
once with me to General <hi>Monk,</hi> and it was to congratulate him; but
with this request, That he would take care, <hi>that Debauchery and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of Religion might not be let loose, upon any mens pretence of being for
the King, as it already began with some to be.</hi> But there was not one
word by me spoken, (or by any one, to my remembrance) <hi>against his
calling back the King,</hi> nor any of the rest here adjoyned; but as to me,
it is a meer Fiction.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>King</hi> was so sensible of the same that I said, that he sent
over a Proclamation against such Men, as while they called them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the <hi>Kings Party,</hi> did live in Debauchery and Prophanness;
which Proclamation so rejoyced them that were after <hi>Nonconformists,</hi>
that they read it publickly in the Churches. Such gross Falshoods as
these, are part of the Evil deprecated.</p>
            <p>As to his Question, <hi>Whether the Presbyterians brought in the King?</hi>
Who can affirm or deny any thing of equivocal Words? A <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
is, who these Men will call such. They that in the Face of the
World deny the Publick Acts of Three Kingdoms, in the Age,
they were done in, no wonder if they multiply the grossest Lies of
such as I. The Parties that restored the <hi>King,</hi> were these; 1. The
Excluded Members of the <hi>Long Parliament,</hi> the Ministers that were
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45244:4"/>
since silenced; and the frustrated endeavours of the <hi>Scotch Armies,</hi> and
Sir <hi>George Booth,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Middleton,</hi> joyning with some of the
<hi>Kings</hi> Souldiers, prepared Mens minds to it. 2. General <hi>Monke,</hi> and
his Army, who were Fighting against the King a little before, repres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>Cromwels</hi> Army. 3. The <hi>Long-Parliament</hi> Members restored, agreed
to dissolve themselves, and set up a Council to call home the <hi>King.</hi>
4. Sir <hi>Thomas Allen,</hi> Lord Mayor, and the Aldermen, invited General
<hi>Monk</hi> into the City, who joyning with him, turned the Scales.
5. The City Ministers (called <hi>Presbyterians</hi>) perswaded the Lord May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
to this, and wrote to <hi>Monks</hi> Colonels (called <hi>Presbyterians</hi>) to be
for the King: (specially Mr. <hi>Ash,</hi> by Mr. <hi>Calamy</hi>'s Counsel.) 6. The
Lord <hi>Mazarine,</hi> Lord <hi>Broghil,</hi> and others of the same Party in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
contributed their help; and Colonel <hi>Bridges,</hi> with others, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
<hi>Dublin</hi> Castle. 7. Many of the Old <hi>Parliament</hi> Men openly
provoked <hi>Gen' Monk,</hi> and secretly perswaded and treated with him,
to bring in the <hi>King</hi> (whom the Earl of <hi>Anglesey,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
and others yet living, can Name to you.) 8. The <hi>Parliament</hi>
called by General <hi>Monk,</hi> (by agreement with the <hi>Long-Parliament,</hi>)
accounted mostly of the same Party, Voted the <hi>Kings</hi> Return: Which
no doubt also, the Old Royalists most earnestly desired, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured.</p>
            <p>This is the Historical Truth; which if in this Age, Men will deny,
I will bear any lies that they shall say or swear of me.</p>
            <p>Now, either the <hi>foresaid Armies, Parliament men, Ministers,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>were Presbyterians, or not. If they were not;</hi> then, 1. Say no more,
that it <hi>was Presbyterians that raised War against the King;</hi> but that it
was the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Men, if these were such. 2. Why then have you cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
them <hi>Presbyterians</hi> so long, and do so still? But if <hi>they were Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians,</hi>
then it <hi>was such that Restored the King.</hi> But alas, how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible,
yea, how odious is Truth grown to this Generation!</p>
            <p>IV. There is yet a more Famous Historian, than any of these,
though unnamed; who pretending to militate after Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi>
as in a 2d. <hi>Part against Separation,</hi> takes on him to give you the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of my Life. Partly making it my Reproach, that when I grew to
Understanding, I remembred how many Drunken or Ignorant Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
had been my Teachers: Partly raking up retracted and oblite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
Passages of Old Writings; while at once they perswade me
to Reviews and Retractations: Partly heaping up abundance of
down right Falshoods: Partly clipping Sentences, and leaving out
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45244:5"/>
the part that should make them understood, and turning true Words,
by perversion, into Falshoods: And partly by mixing this known
Truth, <hi>[That I was on the Parliaments side, and openly declared it.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when at the new Model, I saw that they changed their Cause, I
changed my Practice, &amp; was from the Day that I went into the Army,
a resolved Opposer of all that they did, to the Changing of the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
&amp; their <hi>Vsurpation;</hi> &amp; was sent among them to that end; which
was immediately after <hi>Naseby</hi> Fight: And continued openly disown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Usurpation, and the Means that set it up. And though I was
Preaching and Writing against the said Usurpers, when an Army was
Fighting for them, against the <hi>King,</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> knew how to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
and Honour them, that did so much to his Restoration; yet are
the Accusers so far from forgiving those that never personally hurt
a Man, that they forbear not multiplying false Accusations; yea, and
accusing those Ministers, and private Men that never had to do with
Wars: Yea, the same Men that then wrote against me for the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
and Usurpers, have since been the fierce Accusers of us, that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
them.</p>
            <p>And if these Men be unsatisfyed of my present Judgment, I have no
hope of giving them Satisfaction, if all will not do it, which I have
largely written in my <hi>Second Plea for Peace, for Loyalty, and against
Rebellion;</hi> and all my Confutation of <hi>Hcoker</hi>'s <hi>Politicks,</hi> in the Last
Part of my <hi>Christian Directory;</hi> with much more.</p>
            <p>But this Book must have (if any) a Peculiar Answer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>V. Lately, when I taught my Hearers,</hi> That we must not make the
World believe, that we are under greater Sufferings, than we are, nor be
unthankful for our Peace, and that we must when any hurt us, love and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
them, and see that we fail not of our Duty to them; but not forsake
the owning, and just defending by Scripture-Evidence the Truth opposed.
<hi>They Printed, that I</hi> Bid the People Resist, and not stand still, and dye like
Dogs. <hi>And I was put the next Day to appeal to many Hundred Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
who all knew, that the Accusation was most impudent Lies.
This is our present Case.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VI. The Players, I hope, expect no Answer to their Part.</p>
