            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It cannot be denied but that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

They look upon Religion as a thing mean and despicable, and far below the concern of such great <hi>Masters of Reason,</hi> as they pretend to be. Nay, we are come to such an indifferency in matters of Religion, that many of our Laity do look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as a piece of Grandeur and Bravery, to trample upon all that's Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and stamp'd with a Divine Character. Don't we see them daily endeavouring to expose the Clergy to Ignominy and Reproach, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench and diminish their Revenues, to represent them as Abject and Vile Persons, as the refuse of all the people, and even to Rob them of those Spiritual Priviledges with which our Saviour has invested them, and of which no Mortal can just<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And it is no small encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that our New Libellers afford these open Prophaners of Religion to persist in their Wicked courses, of exposing the Clergy and consequently Religion it self to Scorn and Derision; for unless the Clergy be had in that Esteem and Respect by the Laity which their Sacred Function does r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of our Brethren. And it were very unjust to Upbraid one that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And all the Instances in this Book, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Personal Reflexions upon the Life or Morals of any, do not amount to above two or three, which I have ground to believe were slipt into the Book without the consent or privity of the Author. But the true design of this Discourse was, to inform the World what great Damage did accrue to Religion, by the ridiculous manner in which our Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians are wont to handle all Matters that are Sacred; how they infuse into the Minds of the People sordid and mean Notions of the Great and Eternal God; how they often fright many into an unreasonable Despair of God's Mercy, by the horrid and extravagant Notions which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain of the great Mystery of our Redemption, and how by their ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous and nauseous Stuff which they vent in their Prayers and Sermons, they expose the Sacred M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ies of our Religion to Scorn and Derision. And I think the doing of this is so far from being a Crime, that it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Duty incumbent on us, to forewarn People of the fatal Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that such Methods must needs have among us; that all good Men, who have any real concern for Religion, being informed of these things, may contribute their Endeavours for preventing that Deluge of Atheism and Impiety, which has already begun to overflow these Nations, and may justly be imputed to the Principles and Practices which these kind of pretending Gospellers have propagated among us; and that being made sensible of the great Danger to which Religion by such Practices is expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, may for the future discountenance all such Men as without any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission from God do usurp the Authority of his Ambassadors, and by their Drollery and Ridicule prophane all that's Sacred.

               <p>HAving thus given you my Thoughts very freely of the General De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of this Pamphlet, I shall in the next place trouble you with a few Remarks on the Particulars contained therein. As for our Author's Dedication, which, I suppose, he designs for a piece of Wit, I can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern nothing in it but what is mean and silly. His malicious Reflexions upon that Prelate, whom he so scurrilously Treats in his Dedication, and elsewhere, are nothing but a meer <hi>Brutum fulmen,</hi> and cannot in the least wound the Reputation of so great a Man, he being a Person endued with such excellent Parts, and his Merit having advanced him to such a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter in the Church, that it puts him far beyond the reach of the greatest Malice of any such Scribler. In his Preface, he very civilly Compliments<note place="margin">This Author Reflexions upon the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and some of the Minist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But by what he says in his <hi>Preface,</hi> we may plainly see, that he declares War against the most considerable part of the Church, as being Enemies to all Religion, and betrayers both of our Religious and Civil Rights. And although he's pleased to call them a <hi>Faction</hi> only of the Church, yet he must own them to be such a Faction as are the greatest part, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the fullest Representative of the Society, since by their Interest in the House of Convocation they opposed the Alterations that were then designed to be made in our Offices.</p>
               <p>In the same Paragraph he inveighs bitterly against the Chief Ministers of State here in <hi>England,</hi> who, upon the Application of some of the Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Clergy to this Government, were pleased, out of a Compassionate sense of their Miseries and Oppression, to espouse their Interest, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to procure them a Redress of their Grievances. These Men he represents, as having been formerly <hi>Instruments to bring us under Popery and Slavery;</hi> and whether this be not such a Reflexion on the present Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as does concern it to Punish severely, I leave my Reader to judge, since to accuse the Chief Ministers of State under any Government of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59278:15"/>
such odious Crimes as <hi>Enslaving their Country,</hi> is a direct Insinuation against the Government it self, as if it, by employing such kind of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, did really design those Mischiefs against the Nation, with which they upbraid their Chief Ministers of State. And here I cannot enough admire the Impudence of this Author, to quarrel with the <hi>English</hi> Peers for medling in the Affairs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> when he very well knows, that the greatest Encouragement and Support the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Party in that Kingdom have, is from the in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

At the beginning of the Reformation it was not thought safe, that the Popish Bishops, who still adhered to their Errors and Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, should be allowed to exercise their Spiritual Jurisdiction in the Church, and therefore they were excluded therefrom, and others of the Reformed Communion, being Vested with Episcopal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, were surrogated in their stead, and called by the Name of <hi>Superintendents;</hi> the Sees of the Popish Bishops not being Esteemed void, but supplied by Protestant Superintendents, who did not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy any of the Temporal Priviledges and Honours annexed to the Bishopricks. For although the Popish Bishops were restrained from the exercise of their Spiritual Power, yet such respect was had to them; that they were allowed during their Lives to possess all the Revenues of their Bishopri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59278:19"/>
the Reformation, were allowed, not only to enjoy all their Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Priviledges, but likewise to exercise their Spiritual Authority in the Church, and no Superintendants Named for their Diocefes, as was for those of the Popish Bishops.</p>

Again, <hi>Pag.</hi> 15. our Author confesses, That a Party of the Presbyterians did declare <hi>King</hi> Charles <hi>the Second to have forfeited his Right to the Crown, and to be no more King, and at the same time, because of his Vicious Life, they Excommunicated him;</hi> which this Author expresly justifies them in, by saying, <hi>They had more Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty than Policy in d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But what the Episcopal Party do now suffer, or have suffered since this Revolution at the Presbyterians hands, is meerly for Maintaining and Asserting the Principles of our Religion, and Adhering to the Communion of the Catholick Church, without which they can pretend no just Title to the Priviledges of the Gospel.</p>

If they, under a pretence of judging it unlawful to hear the Episcopal Ministers preach, shall abstain from Church, and meet together (sometimes all of them in Arms) in their House and Field-Conventicles, the better to carry on their Designs against the State, and there Preach nothing but Treason and Rebellion; and if the Government upon this account shall strictly prohibit all such seditious Meetings, and punish those who frequent them; can this, I beseech you, be called <hi>Susfering for Religion?</hi> And yet this is the very case of our Presbyterians; for their Meetings were Prohibited by Act of Parliament, chiefly upon account of the Sedition and Rebellion vented in them.

Worldly Pleasures which we so greedily pursue. 'Tis but a bad sign of the weakness of a Cause, when they flee for shelter to the fickle and unconstant Humours of the Vulgar; when they betake themselves to such weak and frivolous Arguments in defence of their Government, 'tis a shrewd indication they are at a loss for better to produce. This new Method we have taken up to promote Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, by establishing nothing that is contrary to the Inclinations of a People, may chance to have more fatal Consequences than we at present seem to be aware of. The settling the Government of the Church upon such a slippery Foundation, disposes People to look upon it as a thing altogether indifferent and ambulatory, so that each Nation may set up what form of Church-Government they please. But if we consider a little the Nature and Constitution of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, we'll soon find that the Government of the Church is not of such an ambulatory Nature, and that it is a very essential part of the Constitution, yea so essential, that it is not in the power of Man to alter it. For God having established his Church as a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and invested it with peculiar Priviledges belonging thereto; he must be allowed to have settled and established a distinct Order of Persons for the governing it, and for admitting Members to a right to all those Priviledges which he has appropriated to the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Society. And if he has separated a certain Order of Persons for this Office, and impowered them, and them alone, to seal his Covenants in his Name, it must needs be Sacriledge in the highest degree for any to usurp that Office, without a due and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Call from those whom God has appointed to conveigh his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. And God can never be obliged by the acts of those Persons whom he never authorized to represent him, no more than a King can be said to be under any obligation to rati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ie the acts of any one that usurps his Authority, and falsly pretends to be his Ambassador. So that to alter the Government of the Church from what it was at first constituted by our Saviour, is nothing less than to undermin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> the whole ground of our Salvation, since we can have no Title to the Benefits of the Gospel, but as we are Members of Christ's Church here on Earth; and we cannot pretend to be Members, unless we b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the impertinence and weakness of this Argument in Vindication of the Church-Government, yet since our Author insults so mightily upon it, I shall comply with him so f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And that this is not sufficient evidence enough to prove their point, will easily appear from hence. The Principles of our Presbyterians with respect to Monarchy, are of a very large extent; they make the Supreme Power of the Nation accountable to his Subjects, and allow he may be resisted and Dethroned for his Male-Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration. So that, if the Sovereign shall at any time think sit to m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ke such Alterations, either in Church or State, as do not exactly quadrate with the Wild Humours and Fancies of that Party; then they instantly betake themselves to Arms, and resolve to involve the Nation into Blood and Confusion, rather than fail of having their unaccountable Humours gratified. But the Episcopal Church of that Kingdom have greater restraints upon them; they own, in Consormity to the Laws of the Rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>, and to the Laws of God in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And therefore, although the Sovereign should chance to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

They may indeed ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This is, and has been the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Principle and Doctrine of our Church; and if any of its Members have Acted contrary thereto, they have in so far deserted the Principles of their Church, and slighted their Sacred Vows and Obligations, and therefore ought in Conscience speedily to return

to their Duty. The Reason why the Episcopal Church Act more submissively to the Lawful Powers than the Presbyterians, is not, that there lie stricter Obligations to Obedience upon the one Party than the other; no, they are both subject to the same Laws, are obliged to own the same Prince; and are under the same Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Ties of Conscience to submit and adhere to him.

At the time when this Convention was called in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Affairs of our Nation were in such a distracted condition, as made the Event altogether uncertain; and upon this account many of the Episcopal Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who were wont formerly to be Members of Parliament, thought it safer to keep out of publick business, and therefore refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be Elected by those Shires and Burroughs whom they used always to represent in Parliament. Nay, some of them were so averse from being Elected themselves, that they would not so much as be present to Vote at the Election of oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>airs of the Nation without the consent of the King. So that at many of the Elections one third part of the Members concerned therein refused to be present, and the Episcopal Gentlemen declining to be Elected, there was no opposition made to any that would stand; and this was certainly the Reason why more Presbyterian Members

But notwithstanding this great advantage the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians had in these Elections; yet even in the Convention, had not the Episcopal party been divided among themselves about the Civil Government, their Adversaries could never have gained any ground upon them, in altering the State of our Church. For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Episcopal Nobility and Gentry being dissatisfied about the lawfulness of the State Revolution, withdrew from the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Estates before the Affairs of the Church were considered; and this you must needs suppose, was no small diminution of the interest of the Episcopal Church in that Convention, and enabled the Presbyterians to do there as they pleased. And so I think this short Account of the State of our Nation at that time is sufficient to convince the Reader; that although Presbytery was Established by that Convention; yet it by no means follows, that the Majority of ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

'Tis known to any who are the least conversant in the Affairs of our Country, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons who are mostly drawn away with the strong delusions of that party, are but of the meaner and vulgar sort, and those only in the Western parts of the Kingdom; but the greatest part of our No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Gentry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are Men of more Judgment and Reason, of a freer and more Noble Education, than to be so infatuated, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded by vain and imaginary Dreams. And therefore to clear them from this imputation of Meanness thrown upon them by this Author, and in his own Phrase, <hi>to cut the Throat of this Objection</hi> once for all, that we may not be hereafter any more stunn'd with the Noise hereof; I could have subjoyned hereunto a LIST of all our Nobility that are not Popish, and have Ranked them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they are affected, either to the Episcopal, or Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Government; but being at such a distance, cannot have it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act. And if it were not a thing of unsufferable Toil, and of little or no moment, to make an exact List of the Gentry of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I could shew a far greater Disparity among them, with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to this Affair, than could even here appear in the List of the Nobility, and yet it might be evident from it, how vastly conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable the Episcopal Interest is among them, beyond that of the Presbyterian.</p>

But the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian practice in this contempt of our Saviours Prayer, is so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ridiculous, and many of their party have uttered such Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Expressions concerning it, that they deserve no small Rebuke. And I don't see how they can well Vindicate themselves from what is charged upon them by the Author of the <hi>Presbyterian Eloquence,</hi> that when a Presbyterian Minister was Staged before one of their own Judicatories for this Blasphemous Expression, <hi>That if ever our Saviour was Drunk, it was when he composed his Prayer,</hi> they would not so much as enquire into the Truth of this Accusation, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding it was brought before them, by a person of known Honour and Integrity, who had been one of the Judges of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and offered to prove the Truth of his Accusation, by the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of such Witnesses as could not be well rejected. Now methinks, that although their concern for punishing such Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Expressions had not influenced them, yet at least the deference they owed to a Man of his Character and Quality, ought to have engaged them to take this matter into their cognizance, and make some enquiry into it; and what excuse they can pretend for this Neglect I cannot apprehend, the matter of Fact being so Notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that there was no denying it?

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of <hi>Scotland</hi> are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ar more inexcusable in denying the Request of these Episcopal Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters that addressed them, than those of the <hi>English</hi> Convocation who obstructed the Union with the Dissenters upon the Terms that were then proposed; and my Reasons are these.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:59278:34"/>First, The Dissenters in <hi>England</hi> never offered any Address to the Convocotion, declaring their Willingness to return to the Churches Communion, upon her laying aside the use of these innocent Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies which they pretend they cannot in Conscience comply with. Had the Presbyterians given but the least intimation of their readiness to abandon their Schism upon the making of these Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Clergy perhaps, to further so desirable a Work, might have easily been induced to grant them some Ease as to their unreasonable Scruples about those harmless Rites used in our Worship, which tho' indisferent in their Nature, yet are very signi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>icant in their Use. But it is to no purpose ever to expect to reclaim the Presbyterians from their Schism upon such Terms, since they declare against the whole Body of the Common-Prayer, and the Order of Episcopacy, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful; and therefore to make Alterations in the manner of our Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>hip, which could have no other esfect but to create more Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to our Communion, was no ways consistent with the Prudence that is required in Ecclesiastical Governours. Now this is what the <hi>Sc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ts</hi> Assembly cannot urge in their Defence, since those of the Lpiscopal Clergy, who had the freedom to joyn with them in the Government of the Church, Petitioned them upon that account, and declared their readiness to concur with them in maintaining the Discipline of the Church, and punishing scandalous and contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Offenders, which were all the Acts of Government they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ired to share with them in. As for their Presbyterian Ordinations, they did indeed declare positively against them, and refused to joyn with them in any such Acts as they thought to be direct Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the Episcopal Power.</p>

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59278:34"/>
the great Interest the Presbyterians had in that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>irst Parliament a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ter the Revolution, it was no ways safe for the Convocation to consent to the Dissolving of the present Act of Uniformity, lest they should meet with such Obstacles in establishing another, as they were hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly able at that time to grapple with. The Presbyterian Members of that Parliament were so numerous, that had the present Act of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity been once dissolved, they would have th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>

                     </gap>urgy</hi> by Act of Parliament, they would have started so many new Scruples of Conscience to be solved about it, and by this means occasioned such infinite de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ys therein, as would have made the Re-settlement of our Liturgy, a t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ing almost impossible. If the Parliament had offered to ratisie the <hi>Service-Book</hi> with the Alterations the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion should think fit to make therein, before they Dissolved this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Act of Uniformity, I cannot tell but many Members of that Convocation might have been prevailed with to Consent to some Alterations in those indisferent Ceremonies the Presbyterians so groundlesly exclaim against; that for the future they might not have the least pretence for continuing in their notorious and wretched Schism. But for the Convocation to consent to the Dissolving the present Establishment, without having any security for another, is what none could expect from any prudent or reasonable So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Convocation in <hi>England</hi> might perhaps be the more remiss in promoting an Union with the Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>senters upon the Terms proposed, because they saw no probability of preserving thereby the Unity of the Church, as long as the Presbyterians profess to own no common Principles of Unity with us, that may still oblige them to remain in the Communion of the Church. Unless they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge our Bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>

And therefore an Union with them upon any other Terms, in stead of preserving the Unity of the Church, would be a ready way to enable them to make a greater rent and breach in our Communion, whenever they should see it their Interest again to erect Altar against Altar. But our <hi>Scots</hi> Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly could have no such Pretence against those few Episcopal Clergy that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>esired to be United to them in a share of the Government.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59278:35"/>
They were willing, I suppose, to own the same common Principles of Unity with the Presbyterians, in reference to the Discipline of the Church, that is, to be governed by the major part of all their Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and to submit always to what is carried by a Plurality of Voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in their Meetings; though sometimes they themselves, when they see it for their Interest, destroy this Principle of Unity, so funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally nece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Their 37th Article asserts the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in as plain words as can be desired, where it is said, ''That they give not to their Princes the Ministring either of God's Word, or of the Sacraments, but that only Prerogative which they see to have been always given to all godly Princes in holy Scriptures by God himself; that is, That they should rule all Estates and Degrees committed to their Charge by God, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be Ecclesiastical or Temporal, and restrain with the Civil Sword the stubborn and evil Doers. From whence 'tis plain, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> in her Articles allows the Civil Magistrate no Power or Jurisdiction in Matters purely Spiritual; he cannot Administer the Sacraments, nor Consecrate either Bishops or Priests, neither can he inflict any Spiritual Censures upon obstinate Offenders. The Civil Power may for strengthening the Hands of the Church, and making her Discipline the more dreaded and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, inforce her Spiritual Censures with Secular Punishments, but can lay no claim to the Power of the Keys as his own Right.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59278:35"/>
It is from him the Church derives that Power of having Civil Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties inflicted on such as contemn and despise th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> Ecclesiastical Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures; as in the case of Excommunication, which renders the Party excommunicated obnoxious to Temporal Imprisonment, and inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitates him from carrying on any Suit or Action in the Civil Courts. The Church cannot by her own Authority use the Civil Sword to punish the stubborn and evil Doers; and therefore in so far as the Civil Magistrate extends the Churches Jurisdiction to some Secular Matters, and impowers her to inflict Civil Penalties for the better preserving of her Ecclesiastical Discipline, the Clergy must own the King to be the Fountain from whence they derive this Power. But as for their <hi>Spiritual</hi> Authority and Jurisdiction, which only can be called properly the <hi>Church Power,</hi> they derive it from a higher Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, from God himself, who is the true <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ead of our Church, and it cannot be conveyed to us by the Hands of any Lay-Person. God has instituted a distinct Order of Men in our Church, whom he has authorized to transmit this Spiritual Power down through all the Ages of Posterity, that there might still be a constant Succession of Pastors and Governors in the Church to administer his Wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> and Sacraments to his People. And it is from this Sacred Order of the Divine Appointment that our Clergy derive their Spiritual Power; it is from their hands they receive Holy Orders, and a Power of Ministring in Holy Things, and none but they alone can Divest them of this Authority.</p>
               <p>Our Author's Expression, of <hi>the King's having the making of the Bishops,</hi> is somewhat ambiguous. If he means, that the King is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the Church of <hi>England</hi> a Power to Consecrate and Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Bishops for their Sacred Function, it is such a notorious Falshood as needs no Confutation, the practice of the Church to the contrary being so visible. But if his meaning is, That the King has Power to Nominate any Clergy-man to a vacant Bishoprick, it is no more than what they themselves allow to the Laity in their popular Elections. And if the Laity in these Elections may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to Nominate their own Pastor and Spiritual Guide, I see no reason why the Church should be blamed for allowing the King to Nominate and Recommend to them a Person <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

That this is, or at least was always wont to be, the constant Principle of the Presbyterian Party is so Notorious, that I admire this Author should ever attempt to conceal it.

And whether such practices as these be not directly to invade the Temporal Sword, and Usurp the Power of the Civil Magistrate, I shall leave the Reader to Judge. And if the Popish Bishops be guilty of the like practices with the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, in encroaching upon the Rights of the secular Magistrate, it ought not in Reason to reflect upon the Bishops of the Reformed Communion, since it is what we can be no more accountable for, than for the Barbarous and inhumane practices of the Presbyterian party, because they pretend to be our fellow Christians. It is to these unjustifiable principles and practices of the Papists and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians, that we owe all the encroachments that have been made upon the spiritual Power in these later days; for the Popish Clergy together with the Presbyterians, not being satisfied to assert only the independent Authority of the Church in matters purely Spiritual, have endeavoured to extend its Jurisdiction so far, as plainly to encroach upon the Rights of the secular Magistrate, and to subject the State to the Church, not only in Spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And he says, That it is great Impudence in the Author of this Pamph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>et to appeal to these to gain credit to that abominable Story; as it is likewise most notoriously false what this Author alledges, That the Doctor was constrained to flee; for he averrs it as a certain truth, That there never was any Sentence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced against him, and this (he says) all the Ministers of the Presbytery can attest. He likewise says, That his very Accusers there do utterly deny that there was any such thing as a Form of Baptism used, which is so considently asserted by this Villain. He tells me, he was credibly informed, That the Fanaticks in that place had been at pains to sift these Accusers of the Doctor, and that Mr. <hi>Spalding</hi> the Presbyterian-Intruder there had sent some of his
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59278:40"/>
Followers to examine them concerning this matter, and after all they were brought to Mr. <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ittle tainted with Intemperance as any he knew of his age. And this Testimony ought to be of the greater weight with us, that it comes from one who was intimately acquainted with the Doctor, and had all the advantages of knowing exactly the whole Series and History of his younger Years</p>
               <p>When that Passage of the Doctor was Examined before the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery of <hi>Dundee,</hi> the Doctor received an Acquittance from the Presbytery, clearing him from having any accession to that Scandal given by these two young Gentlemen who were in his company, and accosted the Women in the Fields. And notwithstanding th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> malice of the Presbyterians hath aggravated that Story into a heinous Villany, yet the true and real Ground of it was no more than this, That these two young Gentlemen being in company with the Doctor, run from him to some Women in the Fields, and undecently thrust their Hands under their Clothes.

               <p>Hence we may see how fairly and candidly the Docto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I shall not here resume what the Author of the <hi>Appendix</hi> above cited brings in further Vindication of the Doctor's Innocency, as that he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent two fiery Tryals before the Presbyterian Judicatories in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> one before the Privy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Council at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> which consisted then wholly of Presbyterians, who are still by far the majority at the Council-Board; the other before a Meeting of Presbyterian Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers at <hi>Selkirk;</hi> by both which he was acquitted, and not one instance of Immorality laid to his charge. On the contrary, the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Ministers offered cordially to receive him into their Society, if he would but renounce his Principles of Episcopacy. I think there needs no more be said in the Doctor's Vindication; if he but appeal for his Innocency to the Testimony of those who have known the whole course of his Life and Conversation, he may fairly bid a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance to the most inveterate malice of his Enemies.</p>

supported such a villanous Wretch from feeling the Justice of this Church and Nation. You have long conversed with me, and I appeal to you, and to all my Reverend Brethren, Bishops, Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters and Deacons, to whom I am known, nay to all mankind with whom I ever conversed, and I conjure you and all them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to all men, when occasion offers, as in the fight of our great and omniscient Judge, if ever you or they heard or perceived any manner of impure, or so much as an immodest Word or Insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to flow from me, and I am ready to stand or fall at that Bar accordingly.</p>
                           <p>There is a Party of Men in the World who Treat us, as some Persecuting Heathens did the pure Primitive Christians, whom they sowed up in Skins of Wolves, Bears, and other Savage Beasts, and then hounded out their bloody Dogs to devour and tear them in pieces; is it not enough that our Sacred Order is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, our selves turned out of our Livings and Benefices, (so that many of us (alas) are reduced, with our numerous Families, to a state of starving,) that our Persons are assaulted, and beaten in the open Streets of our Capital City; our Houses rifled, our Families <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Nay, after all this the Malice of some is not satiated, till Hell and Calumny are called up against us; and our Reputation must be blacken'd, and our good Names torn, by the most impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Falshoods and Calumnies which Satan can invent, and his true Offspring publish and propagate,; but, Thanks to our GOD, there will be a Resurrection of blacken'd and murder'd Names, as well as of martyr'd Bodies.</p>
                           <p>You know I have drawn much of the <hi>Odium</hi> and Spite of a Party upon me, by opposing their Errors, their Schisms, their Rebellious and Treasonable Principles and Practices, with all the Reason and Interest I was Master of; though in stead of endeavouring to take away any of their Lives, (which this Libeller also lays to my Charge) I have been at pains to save many of them, and have actually prevailed for saving of the Lives of several deluded Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of that Party, which can still be attested by themselves.</p>
                           <p>I grudge not my Lot, in having my Name thus assaulted and torn by such little ridiculous Scriblers and Calumniators; it were an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable Pride in me to look for better Treatment than our dearest Saviour, the Holy Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, and noble Army of Martyrs had before me; or than the Primitive holy Patriarchs, Archbishops, and Bishops encounter'd, of whom the World was not worthy; such as St. <hi>Athanasius,</hi> St. <hi>Chrysostome, Narcissus</hi> Bishop
