            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>PSALM CXXII. 7.</bibl>
               <q>Peace be within thy Walls, and Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity within thy Palaces.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>COncerning this Pſalm there are Three things which may be conſider'd; Firſt, The Inſcription or Title, which it bears. Secondly, The Occaſion upon which it was written; and, Thirdly, The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Matter which it contains. As for the Title of his Pſalm, tis double; for,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> 'Tis ſtiled in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language, <hi>Schir Hammaaloth</hi>; in the <hi>Greek,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; in the <hi>Latin, Canticum Graduum, i.</hi> a Song of <hi>Degrees.</hi> And, beſides this Pſalm, there are Fourteen more ſet down in order, which bear the ſame Inſcription.</p>
            <p>And why theſe Fifteen Pſalms are called <hi>Songs of Degrees,</hi> there are ſeveral Reaſons offered by ſeveral Interpreters, all which are but Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctural. The <hi>Rabbins</hi> or Doctors of the Jewiſh Church tell us, That there were Fifteen <hi>Steps</hi> or
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:107558:4"/>
               <hi>Stairs,</hi> by which, as by ſo many <hi>Degrees,</hi> they went up to the Temple, and that upon their Solemn Feſtivals, the <hi>Levites</hi> were wont upon each of theſe Steps or Degrees to ſtand ſtill, and ſing one of thoſe Pſalms; and that from this Cuſtom theſe Fifteen Pſalms received this denomination.</p>
            <p>There are others, who think that there was in the Temple a certain place raiſed high above the Ground, like the Galleries in our Churches, to which the <hi>Levites</hi> aſcended by ſeveral Steps or Degrees, and there did ſing theſe Pſalms; and that from thence theſe Pſalms took this Name.</p>
            <p>There is a third Opinion, that theſe Pſalms are ſo called, becauſe when the <hi>Levites</hi> did ſing them, they did by <hi>degrees</hi> raiſe their Notes, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance their Voices, and tune them in an higher Strain than ordinary. But the conſideration of this being a thing rather of <hi>Curioſity</hi> than of <hi>Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> I will ſay no more about it.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> The ſecond Inſcription or Title which this Pſalm bears in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue, is this, <hi>Mizmor le Dabid, a Pſalm of David</hi>; the <hi>Greek</hi> Tranſlation reads it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>a Pſalm to David</hi>: But that's an <hi>Hebraiſm,</hi> where the Article <hi>le</hi> doth govern ſometimes a <hi>Genitive,</hi> and ſometimes a <hi>Dative</hi> Caſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:107558:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>This Title ſheweth us who was the undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Penman of this Pſalm; namely, the <hi>Royal Prophet,</hi> a King inſpired of God, whoſe Name ſtands prefixed before moſt of the Pſalms, to diſtinguiſh thoſe which were written by him, and thoſe which were Penned by ſome other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired Perſons; as, <hi>Aſaph, Heman, Aethan,</hi> and <hi>Moſes.</hi> But to paſs by this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The ſecond thing conſiderable, in reference to this whoſe Pſalm, is the <hi>Occaſion</hi> whereupon it was compoſed and written, and that is thought to be this:</p>
            <p>We read that <hi>David</hi> had been forced to fly from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from his <hi>own</hi> Houſe, and <hi>God</hi>'s, by the Rebellion and Treaſon of his own Son <hi>Abſolom,</hi> who endeavour'd to diſpoſſeſs him of his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and probably of his <hi>Life</hi> too; but, within a ſhort ſpace, <hi>Abſalom</hi> being ſlain, and his Army diſperſed, and <hi>David</hi> returned in ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> 'tis believed that he might, upon that happy occaſion, Pen this Pſalm.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the third thing here conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, is, the <hi>Subject Matter</hi> which this Pſalm contains in it; and the moſt remarkable Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages therein are theſe two:</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt. David</hi>'s exceeding <hi>Joy</hi> for his Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:107558:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to the Place of God's Publick Worſhip, from which, to his unſpeakable Grief, he had been ſo lately Baniſhed.</p>
            <p>During the whole time of <hi>David</hi>'s Exile, there was nothing that did ſo much diſquiet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s Soul, as the conſideration of his forced Abſence from the Sanctuary of God; none of his Troubles, none of his Misfortunes did he ever lament ſo <hi>long,</hi> and ſo <hi>oft</hi> as that.</p>
            <p>But when once <hi>David</hi> had recovered his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Liberty, when the Doors of the Sanctuary did again ſtand open to him, like a Man tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported with Joy, he abruptly broke out into this Expreſſion; <hi>I was glad when they ſaid unto me, Let us go into the Houſe of the Lord</hi>; and ſo it is with all Religious Souls: To them the Houſe of God is a place of the greateſt Joy and Pleaſure.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> The ſecond of thoſe things, which are moſt conſiderable in this Pſalm, is <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>earneſt Requeſt,</hi> both to God and Men, for the Happineſs of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and for the continuance of thoſe Spiritual Privileges which they did now enjoy.</p>
            <p>His Addreſs to <hi>Men</hi> was this, <hi>Pray for the Peace of Jeruſalem</hi>; and what he requeſted other Men to do, he did himſelf, backing his Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with his own Example; for, upon the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107558:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
account of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> being then the Royal City, the chief Place of God's moſt ſolemn Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and a Type of the Univerſal Church, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> put up this Petition to Heaven, <hi>Peace be within thy walls, and proſperity,</hi> or, as our old Tranſlation reads it, <hi>Plenteouſneſs, within thy Palaces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, from the <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Method</hi> of this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, which <hi>David</hi> here preſented to his God, there do very naturally ariſe theſe two plain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions; Firſt, <hi>That Peace is a Bleſſing that is very deſirable,</hi> why elſe did <hi>David</hi> perſwade his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to beg it? And why elſe did he himſelf ſo earneſtly Petition God to grant it?</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That Proſperity,</hi> or <hi>Plenteouſneſs, is commonly the Fruit and Conſequence of Peace.</hi> This I obſerve from the <hi>Method</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>David</hi>'s Petition, <hi>Peace be within thy walls</hi>; that's the firſt part of his Requeſt: and then the ſecond follows, <hi>Proſperity or Plenteouſneſs be within thy Palaces.</hi> And, the truth is, without <hi>Peace</hi> firſt obtained, <hi>Proſperity</hi> or Plenteouſneſs can hardly be expected.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> the firſt Concluſion which doth natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ariſe from the Text, is this, namely, <hi>That Peace is a Bleſſing that is very deſirable indeed</hi>; and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107558:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſo it is; 1<hi>ſt,</hi> In the <hi>Private Families</hi> of Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Men. 2<hi>dly,</hi> In the <hi>Publick Societies, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths,</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms</hi> of the World. 3<hi>dly</hi>; In the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> which is God's more ſpecial Kingdom, and the only Family of Chriſt here below.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Peace is a Bleſſing, that is very deſirable in the private Families of particular Perſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are three chief Relations, which are commonly found in the Families of Men; that of <hi>Husbands</hi> and <hi>Wives, Parents</hi> and <hi>Children, Maſters</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi>; and how pleaſant, how joyful a thing muſt it needs be for all the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who conſtitute the whole Family, to live together in Peace and Unity! Husbands and Wives are called <hi>One Fleſh</hi>; and certainly it can never do well if they be not of <hi>One Spirit</hi> too; for, can they who are but <hi>One Fleſh</hi> be divided without ſore <hi>Rents</hi> and Wounds? Again, <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> are but the <hi>Parts</hi> of their own Parents, and can any <hi>part,</hi> that is <hi>quick</hi> and living, be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the <hi>whole,</hi> without ſenſe of much <hi>pain</hi> and anguiſh? And as for <hi>Servants,</hi> they are their <hi>Maſters Truſtees</hi>; and if they bear a grudge to their Maſters <hi>Perſon,</hi> 'tis ten to one but they will falſify their <hi>Truſt</hi> too.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:107558:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>But where Husbands and Wives are of the <hi>ſame mind,</hi> and draw the <hi>ſame yoke,</hi> and in the <hi>ſame way</hi>; where Parents love their Children, and Children love their Parents; where Maſters are kind to their Servants, and Servants chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obey their Maſters; where the <hi>inferior</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation doth <hi>readily do</hi> what the <hi>Superior</hi> doth <hi>prudently require</hi>: In ſhort, when the <hi>Hand</hi> doth willingly <hi>execute</hi> what the <hi>Head</hi> doth wiſely <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive</hi> and dictate. Where the caſe ſtands thus, ſuch Families are in the ready way, and take the right courſe to thrive.</p>
            <p>But on the other hand, if Strifes and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions ariſe and grow in a Family; if, as our Lord ſpeaks, <hi>The father ſhall be divided againſt the ſon, and the ſon againſt the father</hi>;<note place="margin">Luke 12.53.</note> 
               <hi>the mother againſt the daughter, and the daughter againſt the mother;</hi> where Relations, who are ſo <hi>near</hi> in <hi>Blood,</hi> are at ſuch <hi>diſtance</hi> in point of <hi>Affection,</hi> ſuch Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies can never expect God's Bleſſing to make them Proſper; nor indeed can they heartily unite any joint Petitions to beg it.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Now, much like to this Caſe of the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> is the preſent Caſe of the Church of <hi>England</hi> too; for, as they were divided about their Preachers, ſo are we; as, among them, one was for <hi>Paul,</hi> another for <hi>Apollo,</hi> and a third for <hi>Cephas</hi>; ſo, among us, one is for an <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal</hi> Preacher, another for a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> a third for an <hi>Independent</hi>: One Man is for thoſe <hi>ſet Forms</hi> of Prayer which our very Excellent <hi>Liturgy</hi> preſcribes, and I cannot blame him; another Man is for <hi>extempore</hi> Effuſions; and ſure I am, that even theſe alſo are <hi>ſet</hi> and <hi>ſtinted</hi> Forms, though not to the <hi>Speaker</hi> himſelf, yet to every other Man that hears them: Again, one Man is for performing the Duties of our Publick Worſhip in a <hi>Church,</hi> a place Built and Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the Service of God alone; but another Man is for Worſhipping the Great Majeſty of Heaven in an homely <hi>Barn,</hi> a place built and deſigned only for the <hi>Civil</hi> and Common Uſes of men. Once more; One Man is for our Publick <hi>Aſſemblies,</hi> which are Eſtabliſhed by our Laws; another Man is for <hi>Conventicles</hi> in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:107558:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Private <hi>Houſes</hi>; and ſince theſe <hi>Conventicles</hi> have been ſo very <hi>numerous,</hi> and ſince ſo many <hi>ſorts</hi> of <hi>Diſſenters</hi> have reſorted to them, 'tis from the Good Providence of God that theſe <hi>Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi> have not yet emptied our <hi>Churches,</hi> that theſe <hi>back Ditches</hi> have not yet drawn the <hi>main Stream</hi> quite dry.</p>
            <p>But can the Wiſeſt of men amongſt us fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee what the end of our Diviſions may prove? Sure I am, its preſent Effects are but ſad ones; for, by theſe Diviſions we do prejudice the beſt Religion in the World; we do thereby very much diſcourage <hi>Jews, Papiſts, Turks,</hi> Men of all <hi>other</hi> Religions, from embracing <hi>ours.</hi> For, may they not juſtly ſay, the <hi>true</hi> way of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping God being but <hi>one,</hi> ſince there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſuch a <hi>diverſity</hi> of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about it, who can aſſure us, which may be the only right one?</p>
            <p>Beſides, this Difference in <hi>Judgment</hi> doth naturally produce <hi>Difference</hi> in <hi>Practice</hi> too; and difference in Practice doth commonly create difference in <hi>Affection</hi>; and when theſe Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences meet together, they are wont to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>Schiſms</hi> in the <hi>Church, Seditions</hi> in the <hi>State,</hi> and <hi>Confuſions</hi> in <hi>both.</hi> Nay, when Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:107558:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in matters of Religion ferment and grow high; when divided Parties are zealous every one for his own Opinion, how oft do they break out into <hi>Civil Wars,</hi> ſome of them defending their Errors by the <hi>Sword,</hi> which they could never have defended by any <hi>other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now then, if theſe be the uſual Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of Diviſions in matters of Religion, how deſirable a Bleſſing muſt Unity and Peace be in the Church of God?</p>
            <p n="3">III. Peace is a Bleſſing very deſirable in the <hi>Civil</hi> Societies of Men, in <hi>Towns</hi> and <hi>Cities,</hi> in the <hi>Commonwealths</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms</hi> of the World; at Home amongſt our ſelves, and Abroad with all other Nations too.</p>
            <p>I need not tell you, that in <hi>Halcyon</hi> days, when things are quiet at Home, the <hi>Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> may ſafely mind his <hi>Shop,</hi> and the <hi>Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> his <hi>Plow</hi>; In times of Peace, our <hi>Flocks</hi> and Herds are wont to Multiply, our <hi>Corn</hi> comes ſafe into the Barn, our <hi>Markets</hi> are full, our <hi>Courts</hi> are open, our <hi>Laws</hi> retain their Force, and <hi>Juſtice</hi> betwixt Man and Man may freely be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred; In times of Peace every Man may ſit under his own Fig-tree, under his own
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:107558:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Vine, and quietly eat the Fruit of his own La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
            <p>And when we are at Peace abroad with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations; how cheerfully may our <hi>Merch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants</hi> Tranſport their Goods beyond the Seas, and bring back their Ships richly laden with Silks, Silver, Gold and Diamonds? In ſhort, when we have Peace both at Home and Abroad, we of this Nation can want for nothing that tends to make a Kingdom happy.</p>
            <p>But the beſt way to underſtand and value the <hi>Benefits</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> is to conſider the <hi>Calamities</hi> of <hi>War</hi>; methinks <hi>Drums</hi> and <hi>Trumpets, Carbines</hi> and <hi>Piſtols, Muskets</hi> and <hi>Canons</hi> are Names which ſound like to dreadful Claps of <hi>Thunder,</hi> and Ten thouſand <hi>glittering Swords</hi> ſeem as terrible as ſo many <hi>flaſhes</hi> of <hi>Lightning</hi>; for where War is raiſed, Trade decayeth, Merchants break, Taxes grow High, Mony grows Scarce, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are Exhauſted, Laws are Interrupted, Houſes are Plundered, Towns and Cities are burnt to Aſhes, Corn-fields are Devoured, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Blood is ſhed, and whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries are often laid Waſt and Deſolate.</p>
            <p>Now then, if the <hi>Benefits</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> and the <hi>Miſeries</hi> of <hi>War</hi> be indeed ſo exceeding great, we
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:107558:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
may well conclude, that Peace is a Bleſſing ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deſirable by all Mankind, unleſs perhaps it be by ſome proud Tyrannical and Ambitious Princes, or ſuch Soldiers of Fortune as know not how to live without Rapine, Plunder and Wages to deſtroy the Lives and Fortunes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men. Now, to apply this</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider we the great Reaſon we have to keep a ſolemn <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> with all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of <hi>Gratitude</hi> for that welcome Peace, which after a tedious War, is now ſetled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us and our Neighbour Nations.</p>
            <p>For by this happy Peace we are, for time to come ſecured from thoſe Calamities, which we have ſuffered by the late War for ſo many Years together: I need not here again enumerate the Miſeries of War, nor mind you that it hath <hi>drained</hi> our <hi>Purſes,</hi> that it hath <hi>coſt</hi> a World of <hi>Treaſure,</hi> and which is a great deal worſe, that the <hi>Sword</hi> hath <hi>drunk</hi> whole <hi>Barrels</hi> of <hi>Engliſh Blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if the Miſeries of War be ſo exceeding dreadful, our Deliverance from them muſt needs deſerve our Thanks, and thoſe Thanks are due both to our <hi>God,</hi> and to our <hi>King.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:107558:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Our Thanks for Peace are due to our <hi>God</hi>; for he who is our God, is the God of Peace, the great Author of it; ſo doth the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt tell us,<note place="margin">Pſal. 46.9.</note> 
               <hi>He maketh Wars to ceaſe to the end of the Earth; he breaketh the Bow, and cutteth the Spear in ſunder; he burneth the Chariot in the Fire.</hi> When it is his good Pleaſure ſo to do, he can, and doth incline the Hearts of Men to Peace, and in order to that, they ſhall lay aſide the uſual Engines of War; ſo the Prophet tells us, <hi>they ſhall beat their Swords into Plowſhares,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 2.4.</note> 
               <hi>and their Spears into pruning Hooks; Nation ſhall not lift up Sword againſt Nation, neither ſhall they learn War any more.</hi> The doing of this is a peculiar Prerogative, which the Glorious Majeſty of Heaven doth moſt juſtly claim to himſelf.<note place="margin">Iſa. 45.7.</note> 
               <hi>I make Peace, and create Evil; I the Lord do all theſe things.</hi> 'Tis he that raiſeth War in his Wrath; and 'tis he who puts an end to War; and creates Peace in his Mercy; and if ſo, ſince by him we now enjoy the Bleſſing of Peace, can we do leſs than bleſs him for it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Our Thanks for Peace are alſo due to our <hi>King,</hi> as being the great <hi>Inſtrument</hi> in God's hand to procure it for us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:107558:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>We have now a King well qualified with <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Policy</hi> to manage our <hi>civil Affairs</hi> in times of <hi>Peace,</hi> and we have a Prince of wiſe <hi>Conduct</hi> and moſt excellent <hi>Courage</hi> to lead our Armies in a time of <hi>War</hi>; a King who for his Conduct and Courage, doth deſerve a greater Renown, than <hi>Hannibal, Scipio, Julius Ceſar, Alexander</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> or any other <hi>General</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Stories.</p>
            <p>To this King of ours, not only <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> but the <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Holland,</hi> the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the <hi>Emperour</hi> himſelf does under God, owe their Preſervation; for had not our King interpoſed, the <hi>French</hi> King, who is ſo Ambitious and ſo Strong, eaſily <hi>might,</hi> and certainly <hi>would</hi> have overcome them all: And in that caſe the only Favour which <hi>England</hi> could have expected, would have been this, namely, to have been devoured <hi>laſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But thanks be to God and to our King, that Danger is now quite over; for, the French King found his Kingdom reduced to ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, that he was forced to deſire a <hi>Ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>Arms</hi>; but that being deny'd him, he ſaw himſelf conſtrained to conclude a Peace; that

Peace, which no man could have hoped for, had not <hi>our King</hi> diſabled <hi>France</hi> to continue the War.</p>
            <p>And what Returns ſhall we make to our King for this? Let our <hi>Hearts</hi> be <hi>with</hi> him, and our <hi>Prayers for</hi> him; and if any juſt Occaſion ſhall once more ſo require, let him have our <hi>Hands</hi> and our <hi>Purſes</hi> too.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Since we have now a ſetled Peace betwixt us and other Nations <hi>beyond</hi> the <hi>Seas,</hi> let us endeavour to <hi>reſtore</hi> and ſettle a laſting Peace amongſt our ſelves here <hi>at Home</hi>; I do not mean <hi>Civil</hi> Peace only, but a Peace <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical</hi> and Sacred.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The Subſtantial parts of God's Worſhip are all Commanded by himſelf; but it's neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Circumſtances are not ſo; the Miniſter, who is to Read, Preach and Adminiſter the Sacraments, muſt wear <hi>ſome Garment</hi> or other, but whether it ſhall be of <hi>Linnen</hi> or <hi>Woollen,</hi> of <hi>Stuff</hi> or <hi>Silk,</hi> a <hi>Cloak</hi> or a <hi>Gown,</hi> of this <hi>Colour,</hi> or that, the Scriptures do not tell us.

Diſorders, be determined by the <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> of our <hi>Church Governours</hi>; and when once they in order to <hi>Decency, Uniformity,</hi> and the more <hi>ſolemn</hi> Adminiſtration of our Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, have upon mature Advice and Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, preſcribed us ſuch Rules, as are no way contrary to the Word of God, by the ſame Word do we all ſtand obliged in Conſcience to obey them; and were this generally done, our Diſputes and Quarrel about our <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> which are but <hi>few</hi> and <hi>innocent,</hi> would be at an end.</p>

               <hi>The Lord ſhall bring a Nation againſt thee, whoſe Tongue thou ſhalt not underſtand; a Nation of fierce Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, which ſhall not regard the perſon of the old, nor ſhew favour to the young; and he ſhall eat the fruit of thy Cattle, and the fruit of thy Land, until thou be deſtroyed.</hi> An Invading and Conquering Enemy doth God here threaten to raiſe againſt a Wicked Nation.</p>
            <p>But on the other hand, if a Nation prove Religious and Holy, what the Event is like to be, we may learn from <hi>Solomon,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>When a Man's ways pleaſe the Lord,</hi>
