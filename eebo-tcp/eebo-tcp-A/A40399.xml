            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THESE two following Tracts were ſent up hither to be printed, by a Learned Friend of the acute, and judicious Authour, who lately preached them to a Country-cure. They have been peruſed by competent Judges, who think them very worthy to accompany the other <hi>Little Treatiſes,</hi> which have been lately pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in great charity for the better information of the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> and in hopes to reconcile the ingenuous, and inquiſitive among them unto the Church.</p>
            <p>They are, as I am informed, ſhort, full, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, and clear Diſcourſes, and fit for thoſe, who deſire to reade much in little, or whoſe occaſions will not let them ſpend much time in reading
<pb facs="tcp:93179:3"/>
Books. This character I have received of them, and if it may contribute to the better diſperſing of them, I ſhall be glad, not ſo much upon the account of my private intereſt, which cannot be much advanced by ſo little a book, as for the publick good; which I deſire to ſerve in my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and will ever prefer before any private gain, as every good Chriſtian, and Loyal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ought to do.</p>

            <head>A DISCOURSE OF The Lawfulneſs of Compliance With all the CEREMONIES OF THE CHURCH of <hi>ENGLAND.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>HERE it may be demanded in the firſt place, how indifferent actions, or actions of a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle nature betwixt moral good and evil, which are neither neceſſary, nor unlawfull, neither comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded nor forbidden by the Word of God, and in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of which we can ſhew neither obedience nor diſobedience, but are left to our diſcretion, can lay any obligation upon the Conſciences of men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> They may oblige the Conſcience upon a fourfold account; As <hi>firſt.</hi> When we bind our ſelves with a Vow to God to doe ſuch things, to which we were not before obliged. If the thing be lawfull and indifferent in it ſelf, we are bound to perform it, not for the things ſake, but for the Vows ſake. For when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Vow is not unlawfull, the bond or tye of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93179:4"/>
Religion is contained in it; and therefore that which before was free, is now by reaſon of the Vow made due worſhip to God, or at leaſt for us neceſſary to be done. Although the ſubject-matter, or the thing it ſelf vowed, be indifferent, yet the obſervation of that Vow, doth directly belong to that honour, which by our Religion we owe to God. Of this nature were the Vows and Laws of the <hi>Nazarites,</hi> of which we reade <hi>Numb.</hi> 6. And by ſuch a Vow <hi>Jephthah</hi> was entangled; having raſhly made a vow to offer unto God, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thing came out firſt to meet him, after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from battel and victory, for a Burnt-offering; which proved to be his own Daughter: and therefore was neceſſitated by his Vow, though not to offer her up for a Burnt-ſacrifice, which was an abomination in the ſight of God; yet to doe to her ſo much, as he thought the Law of God would permit, to ſhut her up, and to keep her in perpetual virginity, which the Daughters of <hi>Iſrael</hi> bewailed, <hi>Judges</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Indifferent Rites and Ceremonies, are then to be obſerved, and oblige the Conſcience, when any for want of ſufficient information, and inſtruction is fully perſuaded in his Conſcience that they are not things indifferent, but neceſſary duties: this was the caſe of the <hi>Jews,</hi> when St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote his Epiſtles: The Ceremonies commanded by <hi>Moſes</hi> were aboliſhed by the death of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and therefore no man was any longer bound to conform to them: yet they being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſtrongly perſuaded, it was ſinfull to act againſt the dictates of their Conſcience. So <hi>Rom. 14. 5. Let every one be fully perſuaded in his own mind:</hi> It was lawfull for a Chriſtian to eſteem the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Feſtivals all one with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther days; but unlawfull to profane thoſe days which he thought holy. v. 14. <hi>I know and am perſuaded by
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93179:4"/>
the Lord Jeſus that,</hi> &amp;c. It was an indifferent thing to eat Swines fleſh, or not to eat it; yet if any man was perſuaded in his Conſcience the eating to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, he ought to forbear. v. 23. <hi>For whatſoever is not of faith, is ſin.</hi> Where by Faith we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand a particular perſuaſion concerning things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which we are exerciſed; as that it was lawfull to eat, or unlawfull to eat ſuch or ſuch meats; not true ſaving Faith, by which we become Chriſtians, and lay hold on our Saviour for life and ſalvation, and which alſo the believing <hi>Jews,</hi> miſperſuaded in ſome ſuch particulars, as I have already mentioned, were endued with.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The third caſe is of evident and manifeſt Scandal; that is, when the obſervation, or not obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of things indifferent, doth manifeſtly endanger the Faith of weak Chriſtians, and harden others in their unbelief. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 27, 28. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 8, 9, 10. And indeed one great deſign of the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> was to perſuade the ſtrong Chriſtians, not to put a ſtumbling block before the weak <hi>Jews,</hi> who ſtill adhered to <hi>Moſaical</hi> Ceremonies. So alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. ſuch was the condition of the believing <hi>Jews,</hi> that though they embraced the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith, yet they ſuppoſed that our Saviour came not to aboliſh Ceremonies, but onely to reveal a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther light; and that the Goſpel was not to terminate, or give a period to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but onely that it was a ſuperſtructure upon the foundation of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets:</hi> and therefore they thought, that they might as well part with their Chriſtianity, as with their ancient Rites and Cuſtoms. So that the total neglect of them by the faithfull among the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> deterred the unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> from embracing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93179:5"/>
the Goſpel; and tempted almoſt thoſe who already believed to renounce their Faith. And therefore the Apoſtle doth exhort the believing <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to abate their Liberty, and not to endanger the Faith, and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of ſo many Souls.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Although indifferent Rites do not oblige us to their obſervation directly of themſelves, or of their own account, yet our Conſciences are obliged to the obſervation of them indirectly and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence when they are commanded and enjoined by the Supreme Civil Magiſtrate, and our Sovereign Lord. And this is by virtue of that Divine Precept, <hi>Let every ſoul be ſubject to the higher powers,</hi> which bindeth the Conſcience directly. The command of God to obey the King, as Supreme in all lawfull things (and ſuch all indifferent things are) doth oblige the Conſcience directly, and of it ſelf, as all the Commands of God do; And therefore all things commanded by him, if not unlawfull, do likewiſe bind the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience indirectly by virtue of the Command of God. So when Parents employ their Children, and Maſters their Servants about any buſineſs, the buſineſs it ſelf doth not oblige the Conſcience directly, becauſe not commanded by God; but it doth indirectly and by conſequence, by virtue of the Command of God to honour Parents, and obey our Maſters in all things.</p>
            <p>And that the Magiſtrate may impoſe in Religion things lawfull in themſelves will appear; becauſe if he think the impoſition of them expedient ſome ways or other, as for the peace, and quietneſs, or the unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and the ſettlement of the People, whom he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns, and the keeping of them from diſtractions, and innovations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he may certainly impoſe them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he doeth it as a good and expedient thing. And
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93179:5"/>
what a private man may doe by himſelf in things lawfull, if he think the uſe of them to be expedient for his better ſervice of God; that alſo may the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate impoſe for uniformity on his Subjects. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I ſuppoſe that no Prince would impoſe Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies on his People againſt their will, merely becauſe they are indifferent things, unleſs he thought them alſo ſome way fit and expedient. Now although Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Perſons may be thought the fitteſt judges, of what Ceremonies are moſt convenient for the Church, yet in impoſing them they ought to have regard to the Supreme Magiſtrate, and not to act without, much leſs againſt his conſent. Under the Old Teſtament the Legal Miniſtery, which conſiſted in Ceremonies, and Sacrifices, was not ordered by the hand of <hi>Aaron</hi> the High-prieſt, but by the hand of <hi>Moſes</hi> who was King in <hi>Jeſhurun, Deut.</hi> 33. 5. And after him <hi>David, Solomon, Aſa, Jehoſaphat, Ezekiah, Joſiah</hi> Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> inſtituted the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle and Temple Service, ordered and regulated ſeveral things in which they varied from the Law of <hi>Moſes, 2 Chron. 29. 34. Lev.</hi> 1. 6, 7. erected Altars, and dedicated them to the Lord, deſtroyed Idolatry, reformed abuſes in the Worſhip of God; ſetled both the ſtanding Worſhip of God, with occaſional Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings, and Humiliations.</p>
            <p>The like power have Chriſtian Kings and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours had ſince <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as might be made evident and apparent by Hiſtory. And therefore it is an Article of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which likewiſe all do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, that the King's Majeſty within his Dominions and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries is in all cauſes, and over all perſons, as well ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical as civil, next under God ſupreme Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93179:6"/>
and Governour. And therefore it is by his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority that Eccleſiaſtical Canons are made, and enac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Laws of the Nation; without which men of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring judgments might excommunicate each other but to little purpoſe.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now in the next place briefly compare theſe Obligations together, which many times croſs and contradict each other. The obligation then to obſerve indifferent Ceremonies which ariſeth from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Superiour Powers is generally greater than any which ariſeth upon other accounts. And here <hi>firſt</hi> as to Vows and Covenants, we have the caſe ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted between Father and Child, Husband and Wife, <hi>Numb.</hi> 30. and the ſame is the reaſon between Princes and Subjects: for no man ought to bind himſelf with a vow, unleſs in ſuch caſes which God and his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours have left to his liberty. Otherwiſe Children, Servants and Subjects might by making vows ſhake off all obedience to Parents, Maſters and Princes. Whenſoever therefore he knows the Will of the Prince, or the Laws of the Land to be contrary to the intention of the Vow, the Vow is unlawfull; and if his Will be unknown, it ought to be made conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, and be of no longer force than it is permitted by the Superiours. For as if there ſhould be a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry command of God, it would immediately take off the obligation to the Vow, and make it null and void; ſo alſo a contradictory command of Parents, Maſters, Princes, to which laſt we ought to be obedient, and not to reſiſt upon pain of damnation, doth alſo, though not immediately, yet conſequentially by virtue of the Divine Precept concerning ſubjection, cauſe it to ceaſe. It being not to be ſuppoſed in lawfull Vows and Oaths, that they are againſt the Will of God or of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93179:6"/>
powers, whom by our Oaths we are bound to obey.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to an erring and doubtfull Conſcience; 'tis true that if a man through an erroneous judgment, which is by reaſon of education or otherways invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſuch, be fully perſuaded that to be unlawfull which is in it ſelf lawfull, although the commands of Superiours lay an obligation, yet the greater ſin is to act againſt Conſcience. So <hi>Rom. 14. 23. Whatſoever is not of faith is ſin;</hi> and the Apoſtle adds, <hi>that he that eateth and doubteth is damned;</hi> though not always in the World to come, yet he is condemned in his own Conſcience; which how great a puniſhment it is we may know by divers Examples.</p>
            <p>But if there be onely ſmall inconſiderable Scruples, or Arguments, which draw the mind equally, ſo that the judgment is rendered uncertain, but cannot pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily determine the thing to be abſolutely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, the ſafeſt way is to obey the command, and the duty we owe to the Superiour Powers ought to turn the ſcales: Diſobedience being one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſins, and Obedience a neceſſary duty; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought not to be neglected, for trivial Scruples and Objections, but upon very conſiderable and weighty reaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As for caſe of Scandal; we muſt firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge our duty to our Sovereign, and prefer obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the King before ſatisfaction of Fellow-ſubjects. And to let paſs that uſual argument which is brought, that obedience to Higher Powers is an act of Juſtice, it being their due right given to them from God the King of Kings; But the condeſcention to the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a weak Brother is an act onely of Charity, and acts of charity muſt give place to acts of juſtice onely;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93179:7"/>
nay, charity ſuppoſeth that we rob not others of their dues: But in this caſe of obedience there is a concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence both of juſtice and charity, which ſurely ſhould be of more prevalent obligation than a ſingle one, and that the weaker too; to let this paſs; I ſay that the caſe is far different from what it was when the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote his Epiſtles, for then their Faith was ſo much endangered, that they could not tell well which ſooner to part with, their Faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or Moſaical Ceremonies. But the Diſſenters Faith now-a-days is not ſo much endangered, but they ſeem to be the more confirmed and obſtinate in their reſolutions, and affirm themſelves almoſt to be the onely Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>But foraſmuch as this Point hath been vehemently inſiſted on, by ſeveral Separatiſts, who having firſt made others to be ſcandalized at the Ceremonies and Orders of our Church; and then pretend they cannot conform for fear of deſtroying the Souls of their weak brethren, whoſe ruine they accuſe our Church to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour; I ſhall retort the argument on themſelves, and affirm in the next place, that diſobedience to the Higher Powers is it ſelf the greateſt ſcandal to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, and endangereth the Salvation of moſt Souls.</p>
            <p>It was by this Jealouſie, raſhly and without ground taken up; <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Chriſt</hi> and Chriſtian Religion, were an enemy to government, that the Devil hath in all ages, ſtirred up men to perſecute the Church; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this pretence our Bleſſed Saviour, the moſt inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent perſon, who lived upon Earth, who payed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to <hi>Caeſar</hi> with the expence of a Miracle, was yet condemned and executed: <hi>If thou let him go, thou art not Caeſar's friend,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Jews</hi> to <hi>Pilate.</hi> It was on
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93179:7"/>
this account that the Apoſtles endured bonds, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonments, as men that would turn the World up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide down. It was upon this pretence that the Primitive Chriſtians for above 300 years together, were oppreſſed with the rage of heathen Emperours, becauſe thought diſturbers of the publick peace. So we ſee how the very pretence of indiſpoſing men for ſubjection, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Apoſtles by their doctrine, and the Primitive Chriſtians by their example clearly reſured, is apt to bring Religion into diſeſteem, and render it odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. But theſe diſobeyed onely where God's Law was contrary to the Emperour's, and when they could not obey they patiently ſuffered. But if we will ſtand out againſt our King in thoſe things, which God requires not of us, if we will diſobey our Sovereign, and be never the more obedient to God, if every ſcruple be an excuſe from ſubjection and obedience; theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences will be turned into realities, and we ſhall be left without excuſe, if we will have no regard to the Laws of Men, which are the bond of humane Society, though no ways hindered by the fear of the Laws of God. If tumults and inſurrections ſhall be the appendixes of every command we find not expreſly and in ſo many words contained in the word of God; we may fear that the frequent calamities which will attend men on this account, may cauſe, to ſay no worſe, a great decay of Chriſtian Religion. Let us a little conſider what the effects of mens contumacy and oppoſition of decent Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies eſtabliſhed by Law, by which our late Wars were begun, maintained and carried on in <hi>England,</hi> hath been in our own Nation. How much Religion hath been eſtabliſhed and propagated, by ſtumbling at ſtraws and leaping over blocks, by loathing indifferent Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, when the great duties of holineſs and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93179:8"/>
required conformity? Hath not this been the introduction of Atheiſm and irreligion, the greateſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper among us? hath not this been the original of all Sects and Schiſms? hath it not nouriſhed thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold Errours and Hereſies, which cauſed profane Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to ſit down in the ſeat of the Scorners? and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as we tender the honour of our Religion, and would vindicate it from being an enemy to govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and deſtructive to humane Society preſerved by government, unleſs we would drive the ſame deſign with the Devil, the common enemy of mankind, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of Chriſtians, to bring an univerſal ſcandal on our Profeſſion, and render it odious to mankind; we muſt not be refractary or diſobedient to humane Laws, when the Laws of God permit us to obey them, and give an eedleſs occaſion of offence to thoſe, whom God hath placed in authority over us. And therefore in this caſe, though eccleſiaſtical Perſons are the beſt judges of what ought to be introduced into the Church, yet if there ſhould ariſe a diſſention, for the avoiding Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, the Fathers of the Church ought to give place to the Father of their Country.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 20, 21. that <hi>unto the Jews</hi> he <hi>became as a Jew, that he might gain the Jews; to them under the law, as under the law; to them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the law, as,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to the weak, as weak, to all men all things, that he might by all means ſave ſome.</hi> What think you he would have done, nay, what would he not have done, if the Emperours by his condeſcenſions ſhould have become Chriſtians, by which means a free paſſage to the Goſpel would be laid open throughout the whole World? would he that ſo ſeverely injoined obedience to the higher Powers on pain of damnation, and that ſo readily and willingly complied with all ſorts
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93179:8"/>
of men for the ſalvation of their Souls, have ſcrupled a few indifferent Ceremonies, whereby Governours and Magiſtrates might be alienated from the love of Chriſtianity? he had the ſame reaſon to comply with theſe, as with all other ſorts of people for their good.</p>
            <p>And thus theſe things being premiſed, I ſhall come to ſhew the lawfulneſs of compliance with all the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and this I ſhall doe by one general and comprehenſive argument.</p>
            <p>If then the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremonies commanded in the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law, were indifferent, and might lawfully be obſerved, after the Death, Reſurrection and Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our Saviour, who put a period unto them, even by thoſe who knew the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law aboliſhed at that time; much more are the Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>England</hi> indifferent, and may be lawfully uſed; But the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremonies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of theſe Propoſitions in order; now the ſequel or conſequence will evidently appear, if we compare theirs and ours together. 'Tis true indeed, the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremonies had their inſtitution, and ſignification gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto them at firſt immediately from God himſelf. And the <hi>Jews</hi> ſtill thought that this obligation from God remained on them. But however, they were inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted onely for a certain time, till <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould come in the fleſh, and by oblation of himſelf once, purchaſe the remiſſion of our ſins. And then their ſignification to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the obligation to obſerve and perform them utterly periſhed, ſo far forth as it was from God. For this was the end of the inſtitution of the Sacrifices, and moſt of the Ceremonies, to ſignify <hi>Chriſt</hi> to come, and the offering him up as a Sacrifice for us all, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 23, 24. And therefore the continuation of them afterwards was not from Divine Authority, but depended on the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93179:9"/>
of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and prudence of the Apoſtles; the <hi>Jews</hi> were zealous of the Law, and the Apoſtles were willing to permit it, as long as they embraced Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. But God's inſtitution and injunction being then expired, they were for the time they were afterwards uſed, as much humane and depending on the will of man, as our Ceremonies are now; and ſo in this caſe there is an equality; And it is all one to think that to be appointed by God, which is not appointed by him, and to know it to be appointed by God's Vicegerent.</p>
            <p>But if we will conſider other circumſtances, we ſhall find, that thoſe which attended the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremonies, were very dangerous, and had ſuch tendency to evil, which ours are exempted from.</p>
            <p>For <hi>firſt,</hi> They might well be accounted vain, and as the Paſſover Sacrifices for ſin unreaſonable, <hi>Chriſt</hi> being already offered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It might ſeem to be a mocking of God, and abuſing his Inſtitution, to uſe Ceremonies ſignifying <hi>Chriſt</hi> to come, who was then aſcended into Heaven, and which repreſented his merits as future, when they were already conſummated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The uſe of them was joined in moſt <hi>Jews,</hi> with this erroneous opinion, that they were neceſſary parts of God's worſhip. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Our Ceremonies ſignify onely <hi>ex parte hominis,</hi> or on the part of man; they either ſignify our duty, and what we are, or ſerve to put us in mind of what we ſhould be; but the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremonies did ſignify not onely <hi>ex parte hominis,</hi> but <hi>ex parte Dei</hi> too; they were uſed, not onely as ſigns to put us in mind of our obedience to God, but as means of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying divine benediction upon us; they were uſed not onely as mere Ceremonies, but as Sacraments too,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93179:9"/>
and as proper parts of Divine Worſhip, and as ſeals of the Covenant, as Circumciſion and the Paſſover.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The obſerving of them among the <hi>Jews</hi> by the allowance of the Apoſtles might endanger, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it did, the intruſion of them on the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> And it being impoſſible for the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to obſerve all the Ceremonial Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and come up all of them to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to keep the Paſſover, and offer ſacrifice, it might cauſe them utterly to reject the Goſpel, which was incumbred with ſuch impoſſible obſervations. And here, by the way, I ſuppoſe that <hi>Chriſt</hi> came not onely to aboliſh the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremonies, but alſo to leave all people to the indifferent uſe of ſuch Ceremonies, which were conſiſtent with the ſervice of God, and agreeable to their own Country and temper; which is a true kind of liberty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> It might ſtir up the <hi>Jews</hi> to ſeek righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and juſtification by them. Of how dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence the obſervation of theſe Ceremonies was, may be gathered out of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians.</hi> The main deſign of the Apoſtle in that whole Epiſtle is to reclaim the <hi>Galatians</hi> from adhering to <hi>Moſaical</hi> Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, by putting them in mind of the Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt, Gal.</hi> 4. 10, 11. He blameth them for obſerving the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Feſtivals, to which the <hi>Jews</hi> living among them perſuaded them; which were however the moſt inconſiderable Ceremonies. And in <hi>Gal. 5. 2, 3. Behold I: Paul teſtify unto you,</hi> &amp;c. that is, if thoſe who were circumciſed looked on Circumciſion, as that to which they were bound by the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> then they muſt obſerve the whole Law, for <hi>à quatenus ad de omni valet conſequentia.</hi> And alſo if they ſtood upon that, as a work of the Law by which they ſhould be juſtified, then <hi>Chriſt</hi> would profit them nothing, they being
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93179:10"/>
debtours to doe the whole Law, and therefore would have no benefit by the death of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that you ſee, that though theſe Ceremonies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered abſolutely in themſelves, were indifferent, yet by reaſon of ſome circumſtances, which might be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to them, they were very perilous, and of dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conſequence. Wherefore as ſome indifferent actions (though abſolutely in their own nature all may be ſaid to be equally indifferent) by reaſon of good circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces uſually attending them, are of good report, as tilling the ground, and the like; and ſome, by reaſon of evil cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances uſually annexed to them, are of ill report, as performing the office of an Hangman, or an Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner, which though lawfull, is yet accounted infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous: ſo if we compare the Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>England</hi> with the <hi>Levitical</hi> Ceremonies, as uſed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Aſcenſion of our Saviour, and promulgation of the Goſpel by the Apoſtles, we may ſay that ours are as the former, theirs as the latter.</p>
            <p>Some indeed excuſe the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremonies in that they being inſtituted by God at firſt, ought to have a decent Sepulture; that the <hi>Jews</hi> being perſuaded of their neceſſity, muſt be tolerated, and born with in their opinion. But theſe excuſes are nothing pertinent to the buſineſs in hand; God's Inſtitution when expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red was extrinſecal, and they were no longer to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by his appointment, being aboliſhed by the death of <hi>Chriſt, Col.</hi> 2. 14. Now, if a Maſter appoint buſineſs for ſo long time, and no longer, if his Servant continue in it afterwards, what he doeth, is of his own will, and he may be puniſhed for it. And that the <hi>Jews</hi> muſt be born with, I do not deny; but however, this proveth not but that the obſervation of the <hi>Moſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Ceremonies for that time was of very dangerous
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93179:10"/>
conſequence. And though ignorance might excuſe the generality of the converted <hi>Jews,</hi> yet it could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the Apoſtles and Elders, who knew them to be aboliſhed by the death of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Neither is the queſtion whether the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremonies ought to have a decent Scpulture, or no, but whether ſuch Ceremonies of ſo dangerous conſequence, and ſo highly bordering on un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulneſs, might not however be born with upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more important cauſes?</p>
            <p>So much of the firſt Propoſition, or demonſtration of the Sequel; by which it is manifeſt, that if the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremonies, which ſignified <hi>Chriſt</hi> to come, who was already come, and did aboliſh them by his death, which were vain repetitions of Sacrifices for ſin, <hi>Chriſt</hi> being already offered up for all, which were uſed as Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, looked on as neceſſary parts of Divine Worſhip, were thought ſignificant not onely on our part, but God's too; whoſe obſervation among the <hi>Jews</hi> did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger their intruſion upon the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> for whom it was utterly impoſſible to obſerve them all; nay, whoſe obſervation did tend to confirm the <hi>Jews</hi> in ſeeking righteouſneſs by the works of the Law; did infect ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as the <hi>Galatians</hi> with the ſame errour, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was like to profit them nothing, and their faith to be in vain; if theſe Ceremonies might at any time under ſuch circumſtances be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully uſed; certainly much more the Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which are not liable to ſuch inconveniences, and many of which have been derived down unto us from the Primitive Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>So I come now to prove the ſecond Propoſition or Aſſumption; but theſe <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremonies were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times lawfully uſed even by thoſe who aſſuredly knew them to be aboliſhed by the death of <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> I ſhall not
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93179:11"/>
here inſtance in the generality of the converted <hi>Jews,</hi> eſpecially thoſe who lived in <hi>Judea,</hi> who obſerved them all, becauſe they might not at that time, and ſo ſoon, be fully inſtructed, nor yet till the Temple it ſelf was deſtroyed; nor yet underſtand the extent of Chriſtian Liberty. But I ſhall prove my aſſertion, as by the other Apoſtles, ſo alſo by the doctrine of St. <hi>Paul</hi> and his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, conformable to his Precepts, who knew the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to all theſe things to be aboliſhed by the death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and did among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to whom their obſervation muſt needs prove an intolerable yoke and burthen, moſt oppoſe them.</p>
            <p>As for the Apoſtles, we ſee their conformity, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 1. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us how he reproved St. <hi>Peter</hi> for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carried away with diſſimulation among the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> as we reade, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>And as for St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, we may ſee his Precepts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 14, 15. wherein he exhorteth the ſtrong among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> not to offend their Brethren the <hi>Jews</hi> by their overmuch freedom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let us take notice of his glorying as it were in his compliance and conformity with all ſorts of men for their Salvation in theſe indifferent Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 19. 9, 20, 21, 22, 23. where we may note, that as long as the Goſpel is propagated, we need not ſtand upon indifferences; the Apoſtle did in theſe matters obſerve that rule,</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Dum fueris Romoe Romano vivito more,</l>
               <l>Si fueris alibi vivito ſicut ibi.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Now how the Apoſtle did put his doctrine of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance and conformity in practice, will be ſeen by theſe particular inſtances.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> by his circumciſing <hi>Timothy, Acts</hi> 16. 1, 2, 3. where we find that Ceremony which the Apoſtle
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93179:11"/>
declared ſo much againſt in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> telling them, that if they were circumciſed <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould profit them nothing; <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 2. was now by him applied to <hi>Timothy</hi> notwithſtanding. That he might not give offence to the <hi>Jews,</hi> he took and circumciſed him. The fault was not then in the materiality of the action, which was lawfull enough in it ſelf, but in the formality of the application among the <hi>Galatians.</hi> And therefore Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion certainly was not unlawfull in it ſelf, though it was unlawfull to put any confidence in it, as a work of the Law, which the <hi>Galatians</hi> did. For otherwiſe <hi>Paul</hi> would never have circumciſed <hi>Timothy.</hi> And ſo in like manner, if any one ſhould put any truſt and confidence, or think there is any merit, or efficacy in the ſign of the Croſs, if he ſhould adore and worſhip it, as his God, he might well be counted an Idolater; but as long as it is uſed, as an indifferent Ceremony, according to the directions of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> none ought to be offended. For it was borrowed from the Primitive Chriſtians, who gloried in the ſign of the Croſs.</p>
            <p>But we have yet an higher example of conformity and compliance in the Apoſtle, which he did not out of his ſingle judgment, but with the advice of an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of Apoſtles and Elders. As in the <hi>Acts,</hi> 21. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25. where we ſee, that though the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders received with much joy the news concerning the converſion of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to the Faith, yet conſidering how many <hi>Jews</hi> there were who believed, and yet were alſo zealous for the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and that they were offended with <hi>Paul</hi> for preaching among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and his Ceremonial Law, and that therefore his perſon would not be acceptable to them; they adviſed him by all means to ſhew his compliance with them in his conformity to their Rites
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93179:12"/>
and Ceremonies, as doth there appear. Now <hi>v.</hi> 26. we find the Apoſtle following and obeying their counſel; he did not onely comply with them in ſhewing reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Temple, obſerving Rites about Vows and Purification; but likewiſe in their Offerings and typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Oblations. Certainly, ſhould any men doe half ſo much now, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did then, ſome furious Zealots, who place their Religion as much in oppoſing Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did in obſerving them, would cry out againſt him as they did againſt St. <hi>Paul</hi> on another occaſion, <hi>Acts 22. 22. Away with ſuch a fellow from the earth; for it is not fit he ſhould live.</hi> And here, farther, we cannot imagine that this was ill done by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, becauſe he was never guilty of ſinfull compliance in the greateſt danger, and becauſe it was agreeable to his Precepts, and courſe of life all along, and becauſe this counſel proceeded from the joint conſent of the Apoſtles and Elders, in whoſe aſſemblies the Holy Ghoſt was always preſent. Wherefore it followeth that the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremonies, liable to ſo many exceptions, were not however ſo odious and ſinfull abſolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, but that, as occaſion required, they might be obſerved, and lawfully uſed, even by thoſe who knew them aboliſhed by the death of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And therefore ſurely the Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which are harmleſs and innocent, if not pious; which are as no-ways burthenſome in themſelves, ſo inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted onely for decency and uniformity, ought to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. For by thus doing Faction and Schiſm will be avoided, brotherly love maintaintained, peace and unity, the glory of our Profeſſion, preſerved.</p>

            <head>OF THE NECESSITY Of the USE of COMMON-PRAYER IN PUBLICK.</head>
            <p>THE Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> lays down two Rules to guide our Prayers by; 1 <hi>Cor. 14. 15. What is it then? I will pray with the ſpirit, and I will pray with the underſtanding alſo; I will ſing with the ſpirit, and I will ſing with the underſtanding alſo.</hi> And in the 16. and 17. verſes preſſeth the praying with the underſtanding alſo; becauſe otherwiſe, <hi>he that occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the place of the unlearned could not ſay Amen at his giving of thanks, ſeeing he underſtood not what was ſaid; and was not at all edified thereby.</hi> And v. 19. he tells us, that <hi>he had rather ſpake five words with underſtanding, that the Church might be edified, than ten thouſand words in an unknown tongue.</hi> It ſeems the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did much affect praying with the Spirit, as they thought it to be; though they regarded not the underſtandings and edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of their hearers. I wiſh the like may not be ſaid of many among our ſelves, who cry up extemporary praying for the onely praying with the Spirit, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning Common-prayer as carnal and formal; but
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93179:13"/>
if we will examine theſe two ſorts of Prayers, with the Rules laid down by the Apoſtle, we ſhall find that Common-prayer, or Forms of Prayer, are every way as conſiſtent with praying by the ſpirit, and are beſt for edification, and the underſtanding of the hearers. 'Tis true, our underſtandings and inventions too, both of Speaker and People, ought to be under the guidance, directions, and aſſiſtence of the Spirit; as well as our Affections; the former being the nobler, and the latter the more ignoble, and lower faculties of the Soul. And therefore as to praying with the Spirit, it's requiſite that theſe too be ſanctified, that we may clearly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne, apprehend, and find out thoſe truths which God hath revealed, and thoſe ſins which are apt to beſet us, and thoſe mercies we ſtand in need of. But however, it's not to be expected that in all our Prayers the Spirit ſhould help our inventions in finding out new matter, much leſs new words. For the ſanctification of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding doth not conſiſt in theſe. We ought to judge the quite contrary; for the ſame judgments we pray againſt, the ſame mercies we pray for in one pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, we muſt pray for often; and though God's Spirit may diſcover more and more our ſinfulneſs to us, yet the ſame ſinfulneſs on one hand, and grace on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which afford matter for prayer now, may afford us matter to our lives end. As for particular occaſions, they have their particular Prayers. But he is in a very ſad and ſtrange condition, that when he comes to pray to Almighty God, knows nothing at all before-hand what he ſhould pray for, nor what he ſhould pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt, but expects that the Spirit ſhould furniſh him with new matter for his Prayer, or elſe he will be at a loſs. For 'tis to be ſuppoſed, that we are acquainted with our own wants before-hand; and the ſenſe of our
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93179:13"/>
miſery and wretchedneſs in our ſelves, is uſually the firſt motive and inducement to prayer. And therefore the aſſiſtence of the Spirit, and operation on the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and invention, is not to furniſh us with new matter, and words at prayers; but in keeping alive a ſerious and conſtant apprehenſion of our condition, which ſhould remain with us, not onely in times of our devotion, but alſo be a continual guide throughout the courſe of our life. He is to be accounted rather an infidel, heathen or unbeliever, than a true Chriſtian, a man altogether unacquainted with his ſpiritual eſtate, and condition, that knows no Attributes of God to be celebrated, no ſins he is guilty of, no judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he is afraid of, no graces in which he is deficient, no mercies he ſtands in need of; but all of theſe are the matter of Prayer, and all of theſe, every one that knows any thing of Chriſtianity, muſt be in ſome meaſure acquainted with before he performs the duty of Prayer. The knowledge of them being not onely requiſite to that duty, but neceſſary to conſtitute, and denominate him a Chriſtian. And though ſome may think they have new diſcoveries in time of Prayer, which I ſhall not now diſpute of what nature they are, yet the general ground and foundation of their Prayer, is no new-invented matter, but ſuch which before-hand they muſt be acquainted with: and ſo invention of new matter, is not requiſite to the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual performance of the duty. And as for new words, to think the change of theſe ſo needfull, would be to place the excellency of this divine duty in a tone; and to turn this ſpiritual into formal and lip-ſervice; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, if the Spirit ſhould dictate every new word to us, all theſe Prayers might paſs for canonical, and be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the word of God indeed. And yet moſt people
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93179:14"/>
through their ignorance have placed the ſpiritual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this duty in invention of new matter and words; which is quite otherwiſe, and conſiſts in the ſanctification of the whole man, as to body, ſoul, and ſpirit: in the ſanctification of the underſtanding, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, will, and affections by the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>And yet farther, that we may pray with the Spirit, uſing a form of words, may appear from that Prayer which <hi>Chriſt</hi> taught his Diſciples, <hi>Luke 11. 2. When ye pray, ſay thus:</hi> which was ſpoken in anſwer to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of one of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Diſciples to teach them to pray.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That in ſinging of Pſalms, we ſing with the Spirit; and yet almoſt all the Pſalms are Petitions or Thankſgivings to God; that is alſo, Prayers which comprehend both Petitions and Thankſgivings. And the Apoſtle joineth both together, praying with the Spirit, and ſinging with the Spirit. No Sect yet howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have been ſo diſtracted as to venture on ſinging <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempore.</hi> And it is the practice of thoſe who condemn Forms of Prayer, to uſe notwithſtanding Pſalms, which although they owe their matter to divine inſpiration, yet their compoſition afterwards to the art of man. And very good reaſon, for if they undertook to ſing <hi>extempore,</hi> every body would preſently perceive that they were out of tune, or rather never in it; and that their ſongs were as void of rhime as reaſon. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if verſes and metre, though compoſed forms by humane invention, are fit for, and conſiſtent with the ſpiritual elevation of our hearts to God by way of thankſgiving, why is not proſe in elevation of our hearts by way of petition; not to ſay, that ſome Pſalms are perfect petitions; as the 51 Pſalm.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I would willingly be reſolved by thoſe who are altogether for <hi>extempore</hi>-praying Miniſters, becauſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93179:14"/>
thoſe Miniſters pray by the Spirit, whether they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when they hear them, pray with the Spirit or no. And I ſuppoſe that they have a better eſteem of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves than to think otherwiſe, or to deny that they pray with the Spirit. Praying by, or with the Spirit, as it reſpects the ſpiritual performance of the duty, is actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally incumbent on the people, as well as the Miniſter. But yet they themſelves have no extemporary expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, nor will be allowed to have extemporary en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largements of heart. Their Spirits are bound up by the Spirit of their Miniſter, who, if they ſhould not diligently heed his words, and give their full aſſent and conſent, and go along with him in every ſentence, would doubtleſs accuſe them of negligence, profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or hypocriſie; becauſe they do not mind the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of the Lord, that is, that Prayer which he dictates to them, and tieth up their ſpirits and thoughts, that they keep cloſe to it without wandring. Should any of his Congregation pretend that God had put ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoughts into his heart, that he could not attend to all that he ſaid, this pretence would be ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made a note of the Spirit, that it would be thought ſome diabolical ſuggeſtion, which withdrew his heart from giving attention to his Prayer. So this people by the ſame breath they cry up their Miniſter, condemn themſelves. For if it be legal and carnal to be tied to a form of ſound works, which others have compoſed for us, without enlargements of our own; if it be carnal, not to make uſe of our own parts and inventions, in offering up our petitions; if it be carnal to have our Spirits bound up, limited, and confined by words which others have dictated to us, then are all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation carnal, no ſpiritual perſon, not onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of office, but alſo of real qualifications, beſide the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93179:15"/>
Miniſter, who is their mouth and ſpokeſman; for, dare any of his hearers pretend to other revelations? are not their ſpirits confined to his ſpirit, words, and ſentences? for enlargement of matter is denied, onely that of affections in admiration of his matter allowed. Deviations from it, or digreſſions, would be a note of profaneneſs and irreligion, the ſowing of tares among the wheat. But if their Miniſters were not partial, they ſhould, by their own Principle, allow every member of their Congregation, that liberty at the ſame time, which they challenge to themſelves; leave every man to his particular enlargement, and not confine them to his own Prayer, leſt the Spirit be ſtinted in his Brethren, who may have at the ſame time ſeveral motions, raptures, and illuminations: much like the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Church: 1 <hi>Cor. 14. 26. How is it, brethren? when ye come together, every man hath a pſalm, hath a tongue, hath a doctrine, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation.</hi> But ſeeing we muſt join in Prayer, or elſe the Congregation be left diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it followeth even hence, that praying with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit conſiſts not in new invention of matter and words.</p>
            <p>I now come to conſider the ſecond qualification of Publick Prayer, by which all our ſpiritual gifts in their uſe and exerciſe ought to be directed and regulated, that is, The good and edification of the hearers. This is that which the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor. 14. 15, &amp;c.</hi> and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole chapter aims at; that let mens pretences to the Spirit be what they will, yet neither they, nor their pretences are to be regarded, if they intend not edification. The great care of the Miniſter ſhould be, that the people may underſtand him, and be profited by him. This is alſo farther evident from the 16 verſe, which doth explain the former; <hi>Elſe when thou ſhalt bleſs with the ſpirit, how ſhall he that occupieth the room
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93179:15"/>
of the unlearned ſay Amen at thy giving of thanks, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he underſtandeth not what thou ſayeſt.</hi> This is alſo evident from the proteſtation of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the 19. v. <hi>to ſpeak five intelligible words in the Church, than a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude unintelligible.</hi> This is alſo evident out of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent verſes; the deſign of the Apoſtle being, that by plain preaching and praying, they ſhould edifie the Church of God. So v. 9. <hi>So likewiſe ye, except ye ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the tongue, words eaſie to be underſtood, how ſhall it be known what is ſpoken? for ye ſhall ſpeak into the air.</hi> Now that forms of Prayer, as they are compoſed, may beſt be underſtood, by all ſorts of people, is ſo evident, that it needs no demonſtration. 'Tis true, men may, if they pleaſe, compoſe ſuch forms, which are unintelligible, as the Popiſh Prayers, which are in an unknown Tongue, and not underſtood by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality; or we may compoſe ſuch intricate forms in our own Tongue, which few can underſtand. But whatſoever qualification is deſired for clearneſs of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, may better be done in a ſet form, which is made upon mature deliberation, than in <hi>extempore</hi> Prayers, which are composed on a ſudden, whether we reſpect the propriety of words, the eaſineſs and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficancy of the phraſes, the plainneſs of the ſtyle, the diſtinction of the ſentences, and the methodical diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the whole. And beſides, ſet forms publickly and conſtantly read in the Church, have this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, that though ſome expreſſions ſhould not be very clear in themſelves, yet long uſe, whereby people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come acquainted with them, will render them intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But there are but few that can ſpeak on a ſudden ſo pertinently and clearly to any buſineſs, as they can upon mature deliberation. And in this caſe, as ſet forms are likely to go beyond unſtudied Prayers, ſo thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93179:16"/>
and compoſed by the Fathers of the Church, are likely to excel the compoſitions of any ſingle perſon. And if we ſeriouſly conſider the compoſition of our own publick Prayers, there cannot well be any better framed for perſpicuity and information of the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or moving the affections. The words are plain, familiar, and eaſie to be underſtood, the method is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and perſpicuous. The Prayers being digeſted into ſeveral Collects, ſo that we know when we are to confeſs our ſins, when to give thanks, when to pray for grace, and when for peace, and when for the King and State, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, <hi>qui bene diſtinguit, bene docet.</hi> In the Litany we have a brief and pathetical enumeration of thoſe ſins and judgments we ſhould pray againſt, of thoſe mercies ſpiritual and temporal we ſhould pray for, and this in plain terms, not obſcure to thoſe who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand their Mother-tongue. In the ſecond Service, we have the Commands of God, the ſum of what we have to doe, and throughout, a frequent intermixture of the Creed, Epiſtles, and Goſpels, by which in all points we may be ſufficiently inſtructed.</p>
            <p>But now, for other Prayers, which men make with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out premeditation, although this ſhould be granted, that every Prayer be coherent, and that every word and ſentence in the Prayer, might be underſtood by judicious auditours; yet if we conſider how hard it is, to make the generality of people to underſtand thoſe truths neceſſary to ſalvation, what can we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from them, when, beſides the things themſelves, their memories muſt be burthened with variety of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and they muſt be more perplexed to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand variety of words, than variety of matter; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry new Prayer more and more amazing their thoughts,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93179:16"/>
and confounding their apprehenſions, in which, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, its requiſite that every member of the Congregation ſhould join. Whereas one comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Prayer, which ſhould be uſed in all our ſolemn aſſemblies ſignificantly expreſſed, might by care and ſtudy in time be underſtood of all. Nay, though va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety may delight the fancy, and draw the affections the more to the ſpeaker, yet it will be apt to diſtract the thoughts, and a little diſturb the affections, as to the matter, even in thoſe who are underſtanding. For it's not in hearing Prayers as in hearing Sermons, when we come to learn and be inſtructed in the will of God, where, if any thing be not truly and clearly delivered, we may leiſurely conſider of it, without offence to God, or ill performance of the duty; but in Prayer we are to offer up our petitions, which if not clearly expreſt, and our apprehenſions are not eaſie, ſo that the things delivered be no ſooner heard, but underſtood and aſſented to, and paſs immediately to the affections, we ſhall be at a loſs for joining. Now theſe things cannot be ſo well attained to even by thoſe of competent underſtanding in <hi>extempore</hi> Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as in ſet forms: for in theſe latter we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand things before-hand, and ſo have nothing to doe, but to join in putting up our petitions, which is the proper work of Prayer. But <hi>extempore</hi> Prayers are obnoxious to ſeveral impediments, which ariſe from the nature of the Prayers themſelves. For here is a neceſſity of an inſtantaneous weighing and judging the ſeveral expreſſions, continually following each other; together with the application of them to the will, for the ſtirring up the affections to embrace them, which is not eaſily done, unleſs by thoſe who have their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties well exerciſed: as the greateſt part of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditours
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93179:17"/>
uſually have not. For whilſt the underſtanding is conſidering and eſtimating the truth of things, the goodneſs is not repreſented to the will, as deſirable. And beſides, the due underſtanding of a Prayer, depending on the connexion of one part, and one ſentence with another, there will be need of ready animadverſion to take notice of it, and a competency of memory to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it; which qualifications, many perſons, otherwiſe godly and intelligent, may be deſtitute of. And yet farther, the errours to which ſuch Prayers may be lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and obnoxious, from the defects of the perſon praying, are manifold; but I ſhall not now inſtance in any. And therefore I conclude, that ſet forms are ſuch which the beſt may join heartily with, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the generality cannot come to knowledge very well, and that they are the ſureſt ground for the underſtanding to proceed upon.</p>
            <p>But yet there remains an objection to be reſolved, which muſt be, if they underſtand themſelves, the foundation both of their Miniſters plea, and of the Peoples admiration of them; which is thus:</p>
            <p>Though the uſing of ſet forms may conſiſt with praying with the Spirit, <hi>formalitèr,</hi> yet it doth not <hi>effectivè</hi> ſo much as <hi>extempore</hi> Prayers. It's accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the known rules of Oratory, that Speeches read out of a Book, are not apt to affect ſo much, as when retained <hi>memoriter,</hi> and delivered with a lively and gratefull pronunciation. That which ſeems to flow from the heart of the Speaker, works the more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually on the hearts of the Hearers. Now, foraſmuch as God worketh by means, in our converſion and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, which are ſuted and accommodated to our capacities and natures, we ought to make uſe of thoſe which are moſt apt to excite our devotion. Our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93179:17"/>
faculties have need of aſſiſtence, and a meet help, as well as our ſuperiour. And who would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn on this account a careleſs and ſupine reading of Common-prayer it ſelf, as a thing tending to alienate mens affections from it, and to quench their devotions. And therefore ſuch Miniſters, who ſuppoſe themſelves thus gifted, as to be able to excite mens affections by their Rhetorical Prayers, and lively pronunciation and actions, conclude it neceſſary, that they ſhould make uſe of their Talent, and not lay it up in a Napkin.</p>
            <p>This argument or objection at firſt ſight may ſeem ſpecious and plauſible, but if throughly examined, will appear as a rotten-Fabrick, built on a ſandy foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; or, as a painted Sepulchre, which, though beautifull to look on, yet within is full of dead-mens bones. I confeſs, if we compare reading Prayers, and a delivery of an eloquent Prayer without-book, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractedly and abſolutely, onely in order to the exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the affections, the latter may take place; but if we conſider them with thoſe circumſtances, which in general and publick uſe muſt attend them, ſet forms will challenge the preheminence.</p>
            <p>But for anſwer, in the <hi>firſt</hi> place; I have already ſhewed, that the uſe of forms is beſt for the inſtruction of the generality, and ſettled information of the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore on that account may at leaſt be laid in equal ballance with exciting the ſenſitive affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with preſent heats and ſudden commotions, which are not durable. Good affections are but one requiſite to praying with the Spirit, and according to thoſe who place all almoſt in new inventions, ſhould be the leaſt; and muſt be directed by the illumination of the underſtanding.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe ſet forms are beſt for inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93179:18"/>
and fixing the judgment; they are beſt alſo for a due excitation of the affections, ſo that they may be acceptable and well-pleaſing to God. For here is to be obſerved, that there is a great difference between divine and heathen Oratory. A <hi>Roman</hi> Oratour ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not ſo much for information of the judgment, all his deſigns were to engage mens affections to his cauſe, though by blinding their underſtanding and reaſon. Such arts as theſe the Apoſtle declares againſt in the beginning of the Firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and elſewhere, calling them the wiſedom of words, and of the fleſh. But in offering up our Petitions to God, our affections ought not to be led by tones and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, but proceed from the ſenſe and apprehenſion of God's Majeſty, and our own wants. If we will pray acceptably to God, we muſt have our hearts and minds before-hand enflamed with a due conſideration of his glory, and our own miſery. This ought to be had in the firſt place; and then for quickning the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, a lively, ſerious, and decent pronuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of publick Prayers will be ſufficient, which every Miniſter ſhould endeavour after. But when mens af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections riſe and fall according to the variation of the Speaker's tone, it muſt needs be their meaſure and foundation. Now theſe affections, moved after this manner, being onely turbulent commotions of the bloud and ſpirits, and not real longings of the ſoul af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God, are little more of themſelves regarded by him, than mere bodily ſervice; being but the next ſtep higher. Nay, many times they may become pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to ſpiritual ſervice; for, as it hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, <hi>perit omne judicium cùm abit in affectus,</hi> ſo in this caſe, when the tide of mens affections is up, and they carried by external action and pronunciation,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93179:18"/>
without due underſtanding of the matter, they will have but little room for the true ſenſe of want and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. And common people being unable to paſs a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy judgment on the things delivered, and unacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with new expreſſions, muſt be led wholly by the geſture, tone, and pronunciation; and if they be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced for the man, and the delivery be good, all goes down, all paſſeth with them for gold that gliſters. But God is in thoſe affections which are more ſettled and compoſed, (as in the ſtill ſmall voice we reade of, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. 11, 12.) though they do not flame, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, and break down ſo much; as thoſe more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent affections did indeed in our laſt Wars, by miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deſtroying both Church and State; and of ſuch we may ſay, that God is not in them. I do not deny, but that our affections ought to be ſometimes fervent, and vehement, but ſo as they ſubvert not, but are regulated by our judgments; and when the height of them depends on the depth of the ſenſe, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of God's Majeſty, and our own miſery by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and not kindled by the loudneſs of an enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtick voice, or tone.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Hence alſo it will appear, that the whole caſe is clearly miſtaken; for Prayer is by its eſſential definition a repreſentation, or a religious repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our wills and deſires to God. And then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, if it be a repreſentation of our wills to God, we muſt have ſome deſires in our wills to repreſent to God, when we come to pray to him. And therefore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one that prays, ſhould either pray to God, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up his own Petitions by himſelf, or ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the matter before-hand which another puts up for him, that he may ſay, he repreſents his own will to God; ſo far forth as it is conformable to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93179:19"/>
the will of God. As it hath been the cuſtome, when any one is to be particularly prayed for, not onely the Miniſter is acquainted with his deſire, but he alſo gives notice to the People of the ſame. Prayer is the action of the Church; not the declaration of the mind of God to us, but the repreſentation of ours to him; and therefore doth ſuppoſe our affections already engaged. There is none who needs excite a Beggars affections, who is ſenſible of his wants; theſe will make him pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical. And therefore all the compoſitions in our Prayers ſhould be rather to expreſs, and not to incite our affections ſo much, becauſe we come to put up our deſires to God. I confeſs, that in preaching, the caſe is quite otherwiſe, and a greater latitude may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed as to theſe things, becauſe it is ordained, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the edification of the Church, but converſion of unbelievers, who may be drawn by the love of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, to the love of the things themſelves. And herein every one that is endued with the gift, may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe his Rhetorick, and not bury his Talent in a Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin. And likewiſe, becauſe hereby the will of God is declared to us, ſpiritual things, by ſenſible repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, may become familiar to us; and make the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter impreſſion upon us; yet the Apoſtle uſed all plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpeech in preaching, and therefore certainly likewiſe in praying.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Rom. 8. 26. Likewiſe the ſpirit alſo helpeth our infirmities; for we know not what we ſhould pray for, as we ought; but the ſpirit it ſelf maketh interceſſion for us with groanings, which cannot be uttered.</hi> Where, I ſuppoſe, the Apoſtle ſpeaketh in the perſon of weak Chriſtians, or new Converts, who could not well expreſs their minds to God; but yet they knew in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral what was to be prayed for, though they could
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93179:19"/>
not particularly expreſs themſelves; <hi>for we know not,</hi> &amp;c. which doth ſuppoſe, that they knew however in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, though not in particular, before-hand, what they ſhould pray for. And therefore to the due performance of this duty, there is requiſite in the firſt place a <hi>ſcala deſcenſoria</hi> from the ſuperiour faculties to the inferiour, and not a <hi>ſcala aſcenſoria</hi> from the inferiour faculties to the ſuperiour. And hence the inventive faculty of the Miniſter, or thoſe gifts and abilities which God hath given him, whereby he is able to expreſs his mind in more full and ſignificant phraſes, than ordinary people, ſhould not be employed in praying <hi>extempore,</hi> ſo much as in compoſing ſet forms before-hand, both private, wherein thoſe who would ſpeak out of the abundance of the heart, but by reaſon of ignorance to expreſs themſelves cannot, may be furniſhed with apt and meet ſentences; and publick, that thoſe whoſe affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are engaged might, knowing and underſtanding the Prayer before-hand, with more freedom, and without heſitancy join with mutual conſpiration of thoughts, ſpirits, and affections.</p>
            <p>And hence Liturgies were in uſe early in the Church, as ſoon as they could well be compoſed; as is alſo done in the other part of worſhip, in praiſing God, where Pſalms and Hymns are compoſed and accented for the ſweeter melody, harmony, and conſent. And when this is done, he that prayeth ſhould endeavour after the beſt pronunciation, and moſt decent delivery; that though theſe ſhould not be the firſt motives, yet that hereby the outward man, and lower faculties may be ſo far quickned, as not to be an impediment to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour. But to begin, and lay the foundation upon theſe, would be like the affections of a perſon raiſed by the noiſe of Organs and Singing-men, who yet knows not a word of the Hymns compoſed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:93179:20"/>But, if any pretend that the very uſe of a form is apt to dull the affections, and produce formality and lip-ſervice, it's a ſign that words and phraſes lead their affections, and are not expreſſive of them: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, the words being ſignificant, and their hearts ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly engaged, they would be no more wearied with the uſing the ſame good form, than the <hi>Abderites</hi> were, when, after a play written in their own Language, they heard, <hi>O Cupido,</hi> Prince of gods and men! cried out inceſſantly, <hi>O Cupido,</hi> Prince of gods and men, till it caſt them all almoſt into violent fevers. Or than the <hi>Epheſians</hi> were, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 34. who <hi>cried out, for the ſpace of two hours, great is Diana of the Epheſians.</hi>

            <p>Certainly, had thoſe, who condemn our ſaying, <hi>Good Lord deliver us; We beſeech thee to hear us good Lord; Lord have mercy upon us; Chriſt have mercy upon us; Lord have mercy upon us,</hi> often in our Prayers, had they but half ſo much zeal for <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as theſe men for <hi>Cupid</hi> and <hi>Diana,</hi> they might eaſily be of a better mind, and join with us in our Litany, which hath had the approbation, even of ſome Presbyterian Miniſters, for an affectionate Prayer. So far is the reiterating or repeating of the ſame expreſſions, ſuitable to our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, from dulling and quenching them, that it doth rather kindle them anew, and cauſe them to burn with the greater flame. The ſum then, and reſult of theſe anſwers is this; that foraſmuch as clearneſs of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and judgment is annexed for the moſt part to forms, which we may know before-hand, ordinary peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being not able to paſs a ready judgment on new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions; that forms are neceſſary for the due excita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and regulation of our affections, becauſe beſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; that the exciting the ſenſitive affections merely by elocution and pronunciation, may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93179:20"/>
rather an impediment than a furtherance of the ſpiritual performance of the duty; that Prayers are the repreſentation of our wills to God; and the intent of vocal Prayer is rather to expreſs, than raiſe our affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and as far as may be, thoſe unutterable groans of the ſpirit, which by forms may be done moſt ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficantly, and moſt for the underſtanding: And yet the uſe of them doth nothing tend to abate the affections, but to unfold diſtinctly thoſe deſires of the Soul, which were laid before, wrapped up, as it were, in a Napkin; it therefore followeth, that nothing is more neceſſary, than a comprehenſive form of Prayer to be uſed in all publick Aſſemblies; which all being acquainted with, may better underſtand, and may the more freely, knowingly, and cordially join with. And ſo I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a ſufficient Anſwer to the Objection, but yet I ſhall, <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> add another argument or two, to confirm this Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It may be conſidered, that in order to the exciting the affections themſelves, thô an excellent delivery and invention may go beyond bare reading, yet theſe gifts are to be conſidered in the uſe of them, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>abſtracto,</hi> but in <hi>concreto,</hi> as to the perſons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who are endowed with them. Now thô we may grant that ſome of them are able to pray for a long time ſignificantly, methodically, and comprehenſively, yet, have all of them, have moſt of them, theſe abilities? Can they always have ready a new Prayer comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of matter, and yet cloathed with new phraſes and expreſſions, and brought forth pertinently without he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitancy or confuſion? Have all of them at their fingers or tongues-end, <hi>Eraſmus de copiâ rerum &amp; verborum?</hi> No; ſurely we ſhall find moſt of them deſtitute of theſe faculties, and that the efficacy of their Prayers depends
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93179:21"/>
on the peoples fancy, and their own confident delivery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Foraſmuch as people may be as duly affected, and as much edified by forms, as by <hi>extempore</hi> Prayers, we muſt not forget in the laſt place, the peace of the Church and State, which is by far more expoſed by the uſe of the latter than the former. The effect of the one is unity and uniformity, brotherly love, and joining to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in mutual building of our ſelves up in our moſt holy faith: of the other, for the moſt part, diviſions in Church, and rebellions in State; when it is left to every one to doe what is right and good in his own eyes, as our late times have ſufficiently demonſtrated. The <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi> themſelves would not leave us without a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory But, if private Men and Miniſters be left to themſelves, to pray as they pleaſe, both Church and State had need of very good ſecurity for their integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as well as their ability. An heretical, factious, and ſchiſmatical Miniſter, the more eloquent Oratour he is, the more dangerous Impoſtour and Firebrand he may prove. And ſo it is incumbent, both on the Prince, in regard of the State, and on the Biſhop, in regard of the Church, to have an eye to ſuch perſons. And were not our Common-prayer ſufficient in it ſelf, yet being free from all juſt exceptions, the very command of King and Parliament ſhould commend it to our uſe. And therefore let us not imitate, by giddineſs and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wilderneſs, who loathed heavenly Manna, Angels food, becauſe it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; wherefore, though <hi>God ſent them Quails to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie their luſts, yet he deſtroyed many of them, whilſt the meat was in their mouths.</hi> We may all know what enſued the aboliſhing Common-prayer among us; <hi>Let us ſin no more, leſt a worſe thing come upon us.</hi>
