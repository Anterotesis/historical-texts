            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

How then (may any and will ſome man ſay) do you of purpoſe go about to deceiue vs with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing titles, which haue vnder them no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of matter? or were you your ſelues de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in taking in hand that which you were not able to accompliſh?

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ir, my dutie remembred vnto you, deſiring of God your welfare as heartely &amp; more earneſtly, then I either do, or euer did mine owne. I had once purpoſed not to make any dedication of this litle pamphlet, that ſo none ſhould need to be troubled with it, ſaue only they (if there were any ſuch) that wold trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with it. But the perſwaſions of ſome friends wiſhing that this litle bodie going abroad, might haue ſome head to direct it, haue preuailed ſo far, that I began to thinke of ſome friend with whom I might make ſo bolde as to vſe his name (at leaſt vnderstoode the whiche may ſerue for once, vnleſſe wee haue imitated that vnskilfull painter, who muſt needs ſet this epigramme ouer euery thing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he painted: <hi>This is ſuch a thing)</hi> the forefront of this treatiſe, to giue to theſe fewe
<pb facs="tcp:1440:4"/>
ſheetes of paper, the name and title of a perfest booke, the which they doo ſo earneſtly affect. Wherevpon while I did bethinke my ſelfe of the reaſons and reſpects which vſually men follow in dedicating bookes, among the reſt (for there are diuers beſides) yet aboue the reſt (for they are the chiefe) theſe three came to minde, the first is <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarium,</hi> the ſecond <hi>vtile,</hi> and the third <hi>hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum.</hi> Neceſſitie maketh men (writing of matters not only greatly controuerted, but euen flatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted, yea perhappes ſpightfully oppugned) as is almoſt euery trueth by one or other) ſhrowde themſelues vnder the authoritie &amp; countenance of ſome great perſonage, that ſo they may haue ſhelter againſt the ſtormes and tempeſts, which their malitious enemies raiſe againſt their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and the trueth which they do profeſſe. But this ſeemed not needfull for this treatiſe, which beeing rather a Philoſophical then a Theological diſcourſe, of the nature of God in general, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, not only all Chriſtians, but alſo the Iewes, yea the very Turkes and all other infidels doo agree, may ſafely trauel into any country without a ſafe-conduct, or arriue on any coaſt without a conuoy. The ſecond motiue is <hi>vtile,</hi> a Planet that now adaies raigneth by his powerfull influence in the very wils of men, (the which God himſelfe cannot compell) and is the Cynoſura or North ſtar, by whoſe aſpect moſt men lay their plots &amp; courſes.
<pb facs="tcp:1440:4"/>
And ſurely men are not to bee blamed, if by this officious kinde of ſaluting and acknowledging the vertues of woorthie men (it beeing done without flatterie) they labor to procure vnto them deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued fame &amp; renowne, &amp; to purchaſe to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues ſome lawful fauor, as a recompence of their good affection. This may be done, yet it is more lawfull then commendable, for it is better to giue then to to take, and (in the opinion of ſome men) to want then to craue. The third reſpect, is the moſt honeſt and praiſe woorthie, for it hath an eye not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſafetie, or to future profit, but to benefites paſt and gone, and in a maner worne out of mind, the voluntarie acknowledging whereof, eſpecially before ſo many witneſſes, ſheweth a good nature, and a moſt ingenuous minde. Here I did ſet down my ſtaffe, as minding out of this companie to make my choiſe, yet was I not as yet come to my iourneyes end: for as wee all haue many benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, to whom wee are much indebted, ſo it may bee doubted, which of them may by beſt right challenge this dutie to himſelfe. Our beſt bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factour is hee, from whom onely commeth euery good and perfect gift, who hath enriched vs both with temporall and with ſpirituall bleſsings, and therefore doth moſt woorthely deſerue to bee honoured aboue all others, with the firſt and beſt of all the things we haue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1440:5"/>
And without question, the zeale and good affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe men, who (euen in this our age) in thankfulneſſe to God the giuer of all knowledge and wiſedome, haue made him and no other, the Patrone of their bookes and labours, yea though they were not directly written of his nature, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth highly to bee praiſed: yet me thinkes as it is not lawfull to giue to man, the honors which are due and proper to God, ſo it ſoundeth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what harſh (though in trueth it bee not euill, and to bee condemned as ſimply vnlawfull) to giue thoſe honours to God, which are commonly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on men: and therefore euen the godlieſt men haue thought it moſt meete to dedicate their bookes to men like to themſelues, and themſelues both bodie and ſoule to God. So then we muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to humane benefactours, of all which wee muſt acknowledge the publick Patrons &amp; fathers of our countrie, to bee as moſt beneficiall to vs (howſoeuer the enuie which men bear to the good one of another, maketh common benefites not to bee eſteemed) ſo moſt worthie, to whom in the firſt place all honour, loue and dutie, ſhould bee performed both by this, and by all other meanes whatſoeuer. Yet wee are not to ſtay here, for tho publicke perſons be to be preferred, yet priuate duties muſt not bee neglected: the which thing the very heathen did ſee by the light of nature, and therefore aſſoone as they had ended their publicke
<pb facs="tcp:1440:5"/>
ſeruices and ſacrifices to the publicke Gods of their countries and cities, they did without faile look homewards &amp; carefully (thogh ſuperſtitiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly &amp; fooliſhly) honor with due rites and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies their <hi>deos penates,</hi> their houſhold Gods. Neither did they herein think their publike gods to bee iniured or diſhonoured: for being (though fondly) perſwaded that they receiued much good euen from their priuate Gods, herevpon they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred as a moſt vndoubted trueth, which no man endued with common ſence would deny, that whoſoeuer was ſufficient to beſtowe benefites on men, the ſame was ſufficient to receiue honor and thanks at the hands of men. And in very truth, he that would make a ſeparation &amp; diuorce betwixt the beſtowing of benefits, and the receiuing of thankes, hee ſhould go about to take heate from the fire, light from the ſunne, and all ſence of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie out of the hearts, and from the ſocieties of men. But howſoeuer this dutie of thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ought moſt religiouſly to bee performed, yet wee ſee that none is more prophanely neglected: eſpecially towards thoſe, to whome in reſpest of neare coniunction of nature, we owe double loue and dutie: but they what good ſoeuer they doo to vs, ſerue thankleſſe Maisters, whereas wee knowe that Idolatrous and vniuſt <hi>Laban</hi> could ſay to <hi>Iacob,</hi> Though thou bee my near kinſman, yet it is no reaſon, that thou ſhouldſt ſerue for
<pb facs="tcp:1440:6"/>
nought, and be defrauded of the wages due vnto thee. And now at length to come to our purpoſe, I do moſt willingly confeſſe (as I would more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly haue done long ere this, if it had pleaſed you to accept that homage, which I thinke you could bee content ſtill to ſpare) that if euer any man might of an other, then may you of me expect and require all thankefulneſſe of minde, all thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in word, and all actuall teſtification of it by this or by any other means, whatſoeuer is or may at any time lie in mee to performe. Your title is as good as is his (who hauing with great expence purchaſed the feeſimple of a faire and fruitefull Orchard, and enioying it in quiet poſſeſſion for many yeares togither, no man making any claime to it, or to any part or parcel of it, or once offering to ſet eyther foote or face into it: yea planting it with the beſt trees that could be had, and not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering them to growe wilde, and to bring foorth ſower fruite, but pruning and lopping them (yet almoſt ſo as it is ſaid of <hi>Dauid, 1.</hi> King. <hi>1. 6.)</hi> and grafting them with the beſt ſciences that could be had eyther at home or in forrein coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys) to take and taſte an apple of ſome tree in this his own Orchard. If you ſhould ſay, the which I am perſwaded you did neuer thinke, that this were a deare apple, and a ſory recompence for ſo great coſt and care: Indeed I muſt confeſſe, that you might haue bought ten thouſand ſuch bookes
<pb facs="tcp:1440:6"/>
with leſſe charges, yet we ſee this to be the courſe of the world, that when as men haue moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly both charged and toyled themſelues in planting Orchards &amp; ſetting Gardens, yet if they do but taſte of the fruite of the one, and ſmell of a flower of the other, they thinke that they haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for their mony, and are better apaid, then if they had had giuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a thouſand cart-loads of any other (though farre better) eyther fruite or flowers. For all things are not to bee esteemed by profit, or to bee numbred by Arithmeticall, but rather to bee waighed by Geometricall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, which is the better: and truly I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies thought, and ſo it may be, that many others thinke, that you do make more account of a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke good, (the which happely euen theſe ſmall treatiſes may procure more or leſſe) then of a great deale of your priuate profit: As I haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten heard you ſay, that you thought it meete that the firſt borne ſhould bee dedicated to the ſtudie of Diuinitie and the ſeruice of God accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the equitie of <hi>Moſes</hi> lawe made to that effect, the which ought ſtil to remaine in ſome ſort, though it do not neceſſarely binde.</p>
            <p>And therefore inſtead of a better teſtimonie of a thanking, yet more thankfull minde, I am bolde to ſend vnto you, togither with a little treatiſe of <hi>repentance,</hi> for the which you wrote in your laſt letter, another of the ſame pitch and ſtature, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

It is needleſſe I knowe, to vſe many or any wordes, in commending them to you, <hi>Nepotesauis, quam filij patribus chariores eſſe ſolent:</hi> Admit them I pray you into your familie, as did olde <hi>Iacob, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> the ſonnes of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and let your name bee named vpon them. Yea, if you pleaſe, lay your hands vpon them, in peruſing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as your leiſure will permit. Yet do not imitate him in croſsing his hands, and in preferring the latter before the former, (for hee was by the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie ſpirit of prophecie, priuiledged to croſſe his hands, and with all the lawe of God, yea which is more, becauſe they are more the lawes of God, the lawes of nature, and of nations) for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is fitter for your purpoſe, and will bee more profitable for you, ſo much as the true practiſe of Chriſtianitie, ſet downe in ſome ſort in that trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of <hi>repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,</hi> is to be preferred before naked ſpeculation, to the which kinde I muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that this latter treatiſe doth more properly belong. I do heartely wiſh and earneſtly deſire of God, that as you haue been the means of exiſting to them, ſo they may returne vnto you in way of thankfulneſſe, ſome ſpirituall good, the one for practiſe, which is the better part, and the other for knowledge, which is not to bee neglested.

Yet I muſt needs tell you plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that you are too careful of your owne eaſe,

                     <p>I may for faſhions ſake, but I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that it is in a manner needleſſe, and that you are not now to learne, how that God, hauing reuealed himſelfe ſufficiently by diuers euident meanes, doth now in a manner hide and abſent himſelfe from the world, yea euen from his church and choſen people, and that vpon good ground, in reſpect both of the elect, and of the reprobate. Firſt for the elect, we knowe that in the firſt ages of the world, God did reueale himſelfe vnto them by many meanes, which now he hath laid aſide, as firſt in ſenſible apparitions, viſions, voyces, and dreames, yea ſometimes in as plaine and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar manner, as men vſe to talke and conuerſe with their frends, face to face, without any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, ſhewes or vizards. Secondly, God did vſually beſtow vpon his ſeruants many tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall bleſsings, and powre foorth vpon the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, greeuous plagues and puniſhments. This was done in reſpect of the infancie and weake eſtate of the Church and the godly, who being as yet indued but with a ſmall meaſure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and faith, (the time beeing not come, wherein the miſterie of eternall ſaluation in Chriſt, was to be vnfolded) would ſoone haue fallen into diſtruſt and forgetfulneſſe of God, if that he had beene ſtraunge with them: and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1440:15"/>
therfore it pleaſed him in mercie to viſit them often in this ſencible manner of bodily appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions, and of temporall bleſsings, that ſo he might (as it were) keep his acquaintance with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the which otherwiſe wold ſoon, by reaſon of that ſmall meaſure of ſpirituall graces which they had, haue beene forgotten and come to nought. But now in this time of the Goſpell, wherein ſpirituall graces are plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully giuen, and eternall glorie ſo certainely promiſed to the faithfull, yea euen poynted at with the finger, as being hard at hand, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in ſight, ſhould God ſtill dandle them in in his lap with temporall bleſsings, as with lakings to toy and playe with? and ſtill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in viſible maner, as if the Goſpell could not be, either for doubtfulneſſe beleeued, or for obſcuritie vnderſtood? We ſee that when as children are growne vp to any ſtature and ſtrength, they are not onely aſhamed, once to thinke of ſucking the dug againe, but alſo are by painfull toyle &amp; labor continually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, for the increaſe both of ſtrength in their bodies, and of patience in their minds, howſoeuer it bee greeuous vnto them, and make them doubt of the loue of their parents, by whom they are tied to ſo vnwelcome a taske.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="14" facs="tcp:1440:16"/>
In like manner it pleaſed God to deale with his children, not only in withdrawing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe temporall toies, (yet not leauing them comfortleſſe, who haue both plentie of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall graces in preſent fruition &amp; the inſtant hope of eternall glorie, wherewith to ſolace themſelues) but alſo in exerciſing their faith, hope, patience, and loue, by continuall trials and temptations, croſſes and afflictions, as if he had clean forgotten the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and caſt them off for euer. Wheras indeed he doth it onely for the triall and commendation of their faith; which by this meanes is found to be firme and ſound, euen as gold is tried by the fire. For if whenſouer wee are pinched with any griefe, miſerie, or want, God were ſtraightway at our elbowes, with comfort and with ſuch things as wee deſire, either for neceſsitie or pleaſure, what great matter were it to depend vppon him, and to loue him. The moſt blockiſh ſot in the world, would truſt that which he ſeeth with his eies: and there is no brute beaſt in the world of ſo ſauage a nature, but would beare good affection to him, that did daily ply him with good and pleaſant things, one in the necke of another, neither is it poſsible for a man to hope for that which hee alreadie hath.</p>

                        <pb n="15" facs="tcp:1440:16"/>
But when as by faith and hope, we take ſuch hold of God and the promiſes of eternall life, that no temptations can make vs let our hold go: when as in the moſt bitter afflictions we feele the ſweet taſte and relliſh of the loue of God, when as wee doo ſteadfaſtly beholde that which is far out of ſight, then is our faith found to be not baggage droſſe, but pure and precious gold, fit for the ſeruice of the king of heauen. Thus Chriſt ſpeaketh vnto <hi>Thomas,</hi> Ioh 2. 20. 29. <hi>Thou haſt ſeene, felt, and therevpon doeſt beleeue, that I am riſen from the dead, but bleſſed are they that do notſee, or feele, and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue:</hi> that is, their faith is more ſtrong and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and therefore their ſaluation and bleſſedneſſe more certaine. Likewiſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the wicked, it is needfull, that God ſhould by deferring thoſe plagues, that their blaſphemies and other outragious ſinnes, do deſerue, ſuffer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to go on in hardning their hearts, and in filling vp the meaſure of their ſinne.

For although wee cannot imagine any more plaine and euident proofes of the deitie, then the three aforeſaid meanes: namely the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and preſeruation of the world, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall aſſent and voice of all the Nations vnder heauen in al ages, eſpecially of the lewes, who doo generally abhorre this opinion of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſme: and laſtly, the doctrine of the Goſpell, wherein the whole will and counſell of God is fully and finally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed, by ſome or all whereof, many are broght to acknowledge God, and to haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not a full ſight, yet a glimmering of him: yet notwithſtanding all theſe meanes, wee ſee that many remaine in the palpable blindneſſe of Atheiſme, neither knowing in minde, nor acknowledging by word, any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God, then the ordinarie and ſet courſe of nature, becauſe as yet their eyes are faſt ſhut and ſealed vp: ſo that they cannot ſee the light, although it be moſt cleare. But the ſpirit of God is that oyntment, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 20. which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth our eyes, and maketh vs cleare ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: ſo that now it fareth with vs, as with that man, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9. 1. that hauing beene borne blinde (had no doubt) often heard men ſpeak of the Sunne, and the light thereof, and did beleeue it to bee ſo, yet not without ſome doubting, &amp; not at all knowing what to make
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1440:22"/>
of it, or wherunto to reſemble it. But aſſoone as his eyes being opened, he did plainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde the Sunne, with the light and beames thereof, he did no more doubt of the Sunne, then he did of himſelfe, and of his owne bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: ſo men before they bee enlightned by Gods ſpirit, they ſee little or nothing of the glory of God, which after regeneration, is as cleare vnto them as the Sunne at mid-day, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as we read, 2. <hi>Kin.</hi> 6. 17. that <hi>Eliſeus</hi> his ſeruant could not ſee the huge armie of horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and chariots, which was hard at hand, till ſuch time, as God, at the prayer of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet opened his eyes. The fift and laſt means, by the which God is made knowne, are his extraordinary and miraculous works, by the which he hath reuealed himſelf, not onely to ſome fewe of his ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, who haue bin the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments by whom they haue bin wrought, but alſo in the eyes of the world, beholding them. And without queſtion, when theſe are added to the former, they bring with them, to the true beleeuers, euen a huge heape of faith, and aſſurance, howſoeuer to carnall vnbeleeuers, they are often vaine and of no effect. For if vnto that knowledge of God which we haue by the creatures and the light of nature, by his word and ſpirit, God ſhould adde ſuch immediate reuelations, familiar
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1440:22"/>
conferences, viſible apparitions, &amp; ſencible viſions, ſuch ſignes &amp; wonders as he wroght in olde times in and by his ſeruants, we could not but by theſe meanes bee much more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly perſwaded of the power, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and prouidence of God, then now we are, howſoeuer the wicked did ſtill continue in their vnbeleefe, yea though one ſhould riſe from rhe dead and preach vnto them. To ſpeake any more of this matter to you, were no otherwiſe then if I ſhould light a candle to ſhew you who are ſound and cleare ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the ſunne ſhining heere before vs. You ſee that the creatures and light of nature to the heathen, the ſcripture and word of God to the Church, the ſanctifying and illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſpirit of God to the faithfull, the gifts of prophecie, reuelation, and other miraculous actions (the which are not now needfull in the Church, as they were before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt, and in the firſt publiſhing of the Goſpell) to all that either haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, or behold them in others, are infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble demonſtrations of the Godhead, &amp; ſuch againſt the which no exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can be made: yet not withanding al this, it is a wonder (but that it is ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon) to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider how Atheiſme doth daily preuaile among men, yea far more then it did amongſt eyther the ſuperſtitious papiſts, or the idolatrous heathen, of whom
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1440:23"/>
there were very fewe, which had not their religion and Gods in great reuerence, and moſt high eſtimation, whereas now a dayes, fewe do make any account of religion or of the worſhip of God, but as of a formall and ordinarie matter of courſe, which for order and faſhions ſake, is to be performed. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, it pleaſeth God to deale with them in his iuſt iudgement, for the hardening of their hearts, that for ſo much as they haue ſo wilfully reiected ſo many meanes of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, he doth wholely abſtain from any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reuealing of himſelfe by any extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary meanes, but ſuffereth euery one to go on and to proſper in their owne deuiſes and wicked wayes, that ſo their impunitie may confirme them in their ignorance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of God: the which is more to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at, and to be lamented, many of them that haue had ſome knowledge and ſence of religion reuealed vnto them, and haue made conſcience of it in their liues, yet ſeeing no great matters or effects to come of it, but the ordinary courſe &amp; faſhion of the world, they faint in faith by little and little, till at length they become if not open, yet ſecret contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of God &amp; all religion. And ſo is fulfilled the prophecie of Chriſt, <hi>Math.</hi> 24. 12. 24. That in the laſt ages of the world, iniquitie

ſhall ſo abound, that it ſhall coole the luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme loue of many, in ſo much, that if it were poſſible, the very elect ſhould fall away from the faith, and be deceiued: but I doubt not but that you are farre from that fearefull eſtate. <hi>Gen.</hi> That which you haue ſaid, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the exiſtence of God, dothfully ſatiſfie me and may content any reaſonable man: yet becauſe I do ſometimes meete with men that are euen rooted and confirmed in Atheiſme, and will not ſticke to denie that there is a God, I pray you furniſh mee with ſome fewe arguments, wherwith to conuince and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found them.</p>

                     <p>Indeed there are many, which are to be accounted Atheiſts, for that they denie the doctrine of Gods prouidence, and the truth of his word and promiſes, made to his Church of eternall glory (the proofe and declaration whereof muſt bee referred to theyr proper places) wherein we did both agree: but ſure I thinke, you meete with fewe or none, that are either ſo brutiſh in mind, or ſo ſhameles in face, as to denie that there is a God, neither to my remembrance haue I euer either heard or read of any ſuch. The Epicurean Philoſophers among the heathen, were counted Atheiſts, as they might wel be, for they exempted God from the care of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane

things, and from the the gouernment of the world, but they neither denied nor doubted but that there was a God. And ſo I thinke of our epicures and Atheiſts in theſe dayes, that howſoeuer they might as well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie God to exiſt, as to contemne and reiect his word, threatnings, and promiſes, as meere fables, and to be altogither voyd of any care or regard of him, yet if they were examined, I thinke they would confeſſe, that they think there is a God, tho they haue neither know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge nor care of him.</p>

Yea to tell you plainly, I think that ſuch ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing liued in the Church, and in the light of the Goſpell and word of God, are not to bee diſputed with, or perſwaded by reaſons, but rather as men giuen vp to a reprobate ſence, and branded with the moſt fearefull marke of the wrath and vengeance of God, to bee leſt to his iuſt iudgement.

Now the firſt kind of theſe arguments is to be vſed againſt the temptations and doubtes ariſing in the mindes of beleeuing Chriſtians, but not againſt the horrible blaſphemies of theſe ſhameleſſe Atheiſts, and therefore you muſt inſiſt in the workes of God, the which being ſenſible, cannot be denied by them.

And therfore, you muſt lay before the eyes of your Atheiſts, the ſtrange &amp; miraculous things, which haue bin done in all ages of the world (more or leſſe) contrary to the courſe of nature: and if hee reiect all ſtories, both diuine and prophane, yet God doth neuer leaue himſelfe without ſome of of theſe extraordinary witneſſes.

Whereunto ſhall we compare or liken God? or how can we not thinke it to be vnlawfull, and flatly forbidden by the law of God, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble him to any thing, eyther in, or within heauen? or to frame any Image or ſimilitude of him, eyther by outward action in deed, or by inward imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n in our mindes?

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt? the infinitneſſe of the nature of God doth hinder the full comprehenſion, but not the true knowledge of it ſelfe to be in the minde of man: the ſight of the eye, no not the whole eye, is able to containe the body of the Sun, and yet by it, we do plainly beholde, and truly know the Sun, Moone, &amp; Starres, yea the whole heauen.

Firſt, the obſeruation of the effects or actions proceeding from it, the which being ſenſible, will giue vs ſome light to know the nature of the thing it ſelfe, from the which they did proceed, as we ſee the nature of the father to appeare in the ſonne, of the roote in the fruite, and of the fountaine in the ſtreams iſſuing from it.

Yet wee haue not attained to that which we deſire, for we haue not the thing it ſelfe, but onely a patterne or example, a likeneſſe or reſemblance of it: and therefore in the third and laſt place, we muſt adde to this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample or patterne, that which is wanting: ſquaring it in all reſpects to the idea and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit which we firſt had of the nature of the thing.

                        </gap>nd that therefore hee muſt go ſome other way to worke, and ſearch out their nature, by the eyes not of his bodie, but of his mind, and geſſe at their natures, by that which he hath heard and read of their effects, functions and actions. As touching the which, hee findeth in ſcripture that they are Gods ſeruants, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually attending his pleaſure, and praiſing him, and readily performing whatſoeuer hee commaundeth. Wherevpon hee inferreth, ſurely the Angels liue, for they mooue: and they are not brute beaſtes, but reaſonable creatures: yea, not ſimple ideots, but of great vnderſtanding and wiſedome, without the which they could neuer diſpatch thoſe affairs aright, about the which God imployeth them: and further, that they are not weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, but of great ſtrength, for otherwiſe one of them could not haue deſtroyed in one night, an hundreth foureſcore and fiue thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of the Aſſyrians, as we read 2. <hi>Ki.</hi> 19. 35.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:1440:34"/>
and laſtly, that they are not baſe or contemti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but moſt glorious creatures, fit to ſtand and ſerue in the preſence of God. Thus he conceiuing and imagining them, to bee moſt mightie, wiſe, and glorious creatures, to what thing in the world can hee reſemble them more fitly, then to the moſt excellent men in the world, endued with the greateſt meaſure of power, glory, authoritie, knowledge and wiſdome?</p>
                     <p>Now we are come as neare them as wee can in any one thing, for there is nothing more like to an Angell, then is an excellent man, whereof it commeth, that the name of an Angel, is often giuen to men: yet we haue not attained our purpoſe, for there is yet great difference and oddes betwixt them, therefore to make them euen, wee muſt take from this excellent man, this groſſe body of clay and earth, and giue vnto him a pure and ſpirituall body, voyd of all mixture of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and moyſture, the which debaſeth and keepeth him downe beneathe the Angels, who being not clogged and preſſed downe with ſuch heauie lumppes of clay, nor hauing their cleare vnderſtandings dimmed with ſoggie myſtes of moyſture, excell him farre in nimbleneſſe, quickneſſe of wit,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:1440:34"/>
and in all other reſpects. But what need we ſuppoſe this Angelicall man, whom we haue truly exiſting? for we know that in heauen the bodies of the Saints ſhall bee pure and ſpirituall, free from all heauie lumpiſhneſſe: yet the faithfull being glorified, ſhall not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Angels, but ſtill be men, for neither in ſubtilitie of body, nor yet in excellencie of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward gifts, ſhall they bee made equall to the Angels.</p>
                     <p>Thus we haue with much ado, make the humane and the Angelical nature meet togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and vſed the one as a Glaſſe, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and make knowne the other vnto vs.</p>
                     <p>Now then to apply all this to our purpoſe, for the finding out of Gods nature, wee muſt doo theſe three things: firſt, we muſt get an idea, or conceit of it into our mindes, by ſearching what manner of thing God is, and ſo to what kinde his nature doth belong, and is to bee referred: in the ſecond place, we muſt get a patterne, example, or reſemblance of it in ſome thing really exiſting: and laſtly, we muſt by adding and detracting, make them euen or equall. For the firſt, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the nature of God cannot bee knowne, eyther by any eſſentiall cauſes or
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:1440:35"/>
by ſenſible qualities, we muſt imagin it by the effects, actions and workes, whether they be ordinarie, or extraordinarie: <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. The inuiſible things of God, that is, his eternall power and Godhead, are ſeene by the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world, beeing conſidered in his works. For ſo it hath pleaſed God (to the end he might make himſelfe knowne to man, and man happie by knowing him) after a ſort to take vnto this his inuiſible and inſenſible na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, this viſible and ſenſible ſhape, and to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer himſelfe with the creatures, as with a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that ſo he might diſcouer and reueale his hidden nature to man, as we know, that both he himſelfe, as alſo his Angels, haue ſhewed themſelues to men, by putting on the nature and ſhape of man. Not that we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, as ſome haue done, that God is the ſoule or life of the world, and the world the body of God: for God is not in the creatures, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as their matter, or as their forme, but onely is to them the efficient: but becauſe the creatures make Gods inuiſible nature to be knowne, therfore we call them, the ſhape or forme of God. For by this meanes it is broght to paſſe, that althogh God <hi>Iehoua,</hi> as he exiſteth in himſelfe, and as he did exiſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the creation, be inuiſible, yet God the Creator of heauen and earth, is as viſible, as
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1440:35"/>
are the Starres by night, or the Sunne at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day in the heauen, and as palpable, as is the groſſe earth whereon we tread: as it is, Act. 17. 27. God hath made the world, that in it men might ſeeke him, yea grope after him and feele him. Thus both the creatures, and alſo the extraordinary workes of God, done both within and alſo without the Church, and recorded both in holy Scripture, as alſo in other true Records and. Hiſtories, teach vs what God is: yea thus they preach to the whole world, as touching God their maker &amp; Author, that he is a liuing and working, yea a mightie and wiſe nature, excellent, yea infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit in all goodneſſe: to wit, in knowledge and wiſdome, in truth and iuſtice, in loue and mercie, in power and ſtrength, in glorie and maieſtie. Thus hauing conceiued in our mindes an idea or imagination of Gods na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we are in the next place, to bring it forth into the world, by getting an example or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of it, in ſome thing not vnlike vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. But againſt this patterne or reſemblance it will bee obiected (the which you touched before) that both it is impoſsible to finde any thing in the world, that is like to God, or fit to be a reſemblance, and alſo, that if there could any ſuch thing be found, yet it were Idolatrie, to reſemble God to any creature.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:1440:36"/>
Whereunto we anſwere, firſt to the former part of the obiection, that although the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likeneſſe to God, be farre greater in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, then the likeneſſe, yet that there is no creature, which is not more or leſſe in one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect or other, like vnto him: for whatſoeuer is good, commendable, or excellent in any creature (as all the creatures are good, yea e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one of them endued with a proper and peculiar goodneſſe) that commeth from God, who is the fountaine of all goodneſſe, and maketh the creature to bee like to God. So then if the meaneſt and baſeſt creatures haue ſome likeneſſe to God, without doubt the excellent creatures cannot but haue a great likeneſſe and reſemblance vnto him: the which wee knowe, that GOD him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the Scripture doth graunt vnto them, calling man his owne ſimilitude, God made man in the likeneſſe of GOD. <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 5. 1. Yea, although there were no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of likeneſſe or reſemblance betwixt GOD and the creatures, but rather all contrarietie and flat repugnancie, yet they might profitably bee vſed for the illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his nature, as wee knowe that all contraries doo argue and illuſtrate each other. The which way of teaching, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it bee not the readieſt to attaine
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:1440:36"/>
the truth: for that doctrine and knowledge are poſitiue not priuatiue, conſiſting not in the negation of that which is not, or is not true, but in the affirmation of that, which doth truly and really exiſt, yet it is alwaies an helpe, and ſometimes the onely meanes.</p>
                     <p>To the other parte of the obiection, wee aunſwere, confeſsing that it were flat Idolatry, and vtterly vnlawfull, to make or ſuppoſe God to be ſimply like or equall to any creature, for that were to pul him downe from his Throne of maieſtie, and to place him among the creatures: yet affirming it to be very lawfull, to reſemble him to any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the difference which is betwixt them, being obſerued and mentioned. Thus <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 29. the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> reſembleth the diuine nature to the humane, proouing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Idolatrons Athenians, that God is not like to thoſe ſtocks and ſtones, wherin the heathen did worſhip him, becauſe hee is like vnto man, who is of a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary nature to ſence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe things. We men (ſaith he) being the kind of God, it cannot be, that God being like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, that he ſhuld be like to ſiluer, gold, or to any ſenceleſſe thing: where tho he make theſe two natures of God &amp; man like to each other, yet he maketh them not equall, but putteth
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:1440:37"/>
the difference, in that hee maketh man to come and flowe from God, as a little arme or creeke of the ſea, from the great Ocean. Yea thus God hath throughout the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture reuealed himſelfe vnto vs in the forme and ſhape of a man, aſcribing to himſelfe the parts of his body, as his eyes and eares, his hands and feete, yea all the faculties, affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and paſsions of his minde and will, and that both ſeuerally, ſometimes one and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times an other, and alſo al togither, aſſuming to himſelfe, the whole ſhape and forme of a man, as namely, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 1. 26. vpon the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of the Throne, there was as it were a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of a man vpon it: whereof is ſaid, Verſ. 26. This was the appearance of the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of the glory of the Lord: and when I ſaw it, I fell vpon my face: ſo <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 9. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held till the thrones were ſet, and the ancient of dayes did ſit, whoſe garment was white as ſnowe, and the hayre of his head like the pure woll. Likewiſe, <hi>Eſ.</hi> 6. 1. the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaith: I ſawe the Lord ſitting vppon a high throne. By the which ſitting vpon a Throne, althogh ſignifying royall glorie and maieſtie, God doth not exalt or aduance, but rather debaſe himſelfe, and that for our ſakes, that we by this meanes might get ſome conceit and knowledge of him into our
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:1440:37"/>
mindes: yet if we ſhould continue and reſt in theſe formes, without adding the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence vnto them, wee ſhould not helpe, but hurt and hinder our ſelues, and get not the knowledge, but the ignorance of God.</p>

                  <p>NOw let vs go on, and ſee what creature in all the world is to be accounted likeſt vnto God, and fitteſt to reſemble his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture vnto vs, as wee gathered it to bee by the conſideration of his workes. The queſtion is not hard to be anſwered: for this being taken for granted, that God hauing made al things, is far more excellent then any or all of them, it will follow, that that creature, which of all other, is moſt excellent, is the likeſt, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth neareſt to the nature of God, and doth more fitly reſemble him, then any of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: as we know that among men, not any of the raſkall ſort, but ſome great Noble man or Prince of the blood, is moſt fit, in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence or nonage of the king, to hold his place, and repreſent his perſon. For although euery creature bee good in his owne kind, as (wee reade in <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 1. 31.) yet looke how many diuers kindes of creatures there are, ſo many diuers degrees of goodneſſe there are, the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:1440:38"/>
higheſt whereof are to bee accounted excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, as we ſee all the ſtarres to be bright and glorious, yet the ſunne, moone, and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to be the moſt excellent in light &amp; glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; as they were in the beginning, called by God himſelfe by the name of great lights. Thus no man will denie but a common pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtone, is better then a raw lumpe of clay, or a handfull of earth: that a tree is more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious then a ſtone, that a liuing beaſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth a tree, that a reaſonable man is better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a brute beaſt, an Angell then a man, and an Archangell then one of lower degree: and ſo will any man conſeſſe that God, whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit knowledge and wiſedome, appeareth in the creation of the world, is not to be placed among the ſenceleſſe and brutiſh creatures, but to be referred to the kinde of reaſonable things. And ſo indeed throughout the whole ſcripture, we ſee that God is content to take a place among his reaſonable creatures, to be accounted to be of their nature and kind, as hath beene ſhewed out of <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 26. to call them, to wit, both men and Angels, his image and ſimililtude, and in that reſpect, his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, ſonnes and children, yea to appeare and ſhewe himſelf, in the forme and ſhape, ſomtimes of the one, &amp; ſomtimes of <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                     </hi> other. But to come as neare the marke, we ayme at,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:1440:38"/>
as we can, although both the humane &amp; the angelicall nature, be notable images, ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, and reſemblances of God, yet as the Angels are farre more excellent then men, ſo they are (in themſelues) farre more fit tipes and examples of the diuine nature, then men are, for that they haue many properties of the diuine nature which man wanteth. For man is mortall and corruptible, but both the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and God are immortall and incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: hee conſiſteth of a medley of contrarie qualities, continually iarting and fighting togither, vntil at length one deſtroy another: but their nature and ſubſtance is vniforme, not waſting it ſelfe, or wearing away, but ſtedfaſt permanent, and the ſame for euer: he is viſible, yea groſſe and palpable, but they are inuiſible, inſenſible, ſubtile, pure and ſpirituall: hee hath litle ſtrength with much weakneſſe, they haue great power and might without impotencie or infirmitie: hee hath knowledge with ignorance: truth with error: wiſedome, with folly: will with peruerſeneſſe and obſtinacie: affection with paſsion and perturbation, loue with luſt: abundance with many wants, contentment with complaint: day with night: ioy with ſorrow: glorie with ſhame: and happineſſe with miſerie: but they are perfectly wiſe, vertuous, mightie, glorious and happie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:1440:39"/>
Yea, by this excellencie aboue man, the Angelical nature is prooued (againſt thoſe who will not beleeue the word of God, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe their owne ſences ſay amen) to exiſt as a meane betwixt man and god, although farre nearer the lower, then the vpper extreame. For if there were no nature exiſting betwixt God and man, the diſtance and downfall would be greater then is meete, in reſpect of that dependance &amp; cohaerence, which ſhould be betwixt the creature &amp; the creator, cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly combined togither without any ſuch wide and abrupt gappe, in order and due propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The which wide gap betwixt God and man, the angelical nature doth fill vp, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipating ſomewhat of each nature, as it were hanging and houering in the middle region betwixt heauen and earth, hauing had a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with man, and n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

one word, being euerie way finit as is man, yet perfect in al reſpects as is God. Thus we haue by the degrees of the creatures, as it were by the ſtaires and ſteppes of <hi>Iacobs</hi> ladder, clim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed vp to heauen, and leauing men with the reſt of the earthly creatures, groueling heere in the duſt belowe, by the wings of Angels ſoared aloft to the diuine nature, or rather (to ſpeake more properly) toward it. Neither is it poſsible for vs to goe any higher, or to finde more of God in any thing, then wee haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie found in the angelical nature. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon our Sauiour Chriſt doubteth not to put on Gods backe, this glorious robe of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical naure, hauing amongſt all the formes and ſhapes in the world, none more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent wherewith to inueſt him, and therefore he ſaith, <hi>Ioh</hi> 4. 24. God is a ſpirit, as he is elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in ſcripture called an Angell, and an Archangell. But this ſaying is warely to be taken, and wiſely vnderſtood, leaſt that in ſtead of true doctrine, wee gather out of it a blaſphemous hereſie. For in trueth, God is no more a ſpirit, or an angell, (the which two words, are in diuinitie to be accounted of the ſame ſignification and compaſſe) then he is a ſoule or a bodie: what then may you ſay, is the ſignification of theſe words? Surely, they are not poſitiue, but priuatiue: they ſhew not
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:1440:40"/>
what God is, but what he is not, namely, that hee is not a formall, viſible, and ſenſible bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. For ſo they containe in them, a refuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that groſſe opinion of the carnall and hypocriticall Iewes, who thought that an outward and bodily worſhip, voyde of the ſpirituall ſinceritie of the heart, would well ynough fit and pleaſe God: as if a man ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to deale with thoſe heatheniſh idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, that thinke brute beaſtes or ſenceleſſe ſtockes to bee Gods, ſhould ſay vnto them, you are fouly deceiued in this point, for God is not a dead ſtocke, or a brute beaſt, but <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be reſembled to</hi> a liuing man. So then, the meaning of Chriſtes words is this, God although in trueth hee bee not a ſpirit or an angell, yet becauſe that nature commeth nearer him, and doth more reſemble him then any other, therefore hee may fitly for your capacitie be ſo called.</p>

                  <p>YOu remember I doubt not, that it was ſaid, that there are three things required to the ſearching out of Gods nature: firſt, a conceite of it in the minde, gathered by the effects of it: ſecondly a reall example or patterne, wherein that conceit doth exiſt, and may bee ſeene: and thirdly, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the conceite &amp; the example the one being in <hi>abſtracto,</hi> the other in <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creto:</hi> the one exiſting onely in the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the minde, the other in ſome creature and reall ſubiect.

For although we haue alreadie aſcended, and come to the higheſt ſteppe of <hi>Iacobs</hi> ladder, for that it is impoſsible to find any more of the diuine eſſence in any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then wee ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:1440:41"/>
for although there be as great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Angels and men, as there is diſtance betwixt the heauen and the earth, yet there is tenne times, yea ten thouſand times grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter oddes betwixt the Angels and God, and the ſpace is infinitly greater from the heauen of the Angels and ſaints, to the heauen of heauens, where God dwelleth. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are now in the laſt place, to ſeeke out the difference, which exalteth the nature of God thus farre, or rather thus infinitly aboue the Angels: this is the verie true eſſentiall forme of God, the which if it could bee once named, the matter were at an ende, the caſe cleare, &amp; much labor might be ſaued, which muſt be ſpent, or rather moſt profitably and happily beſtowed, in geſsing, coniecturing, &amp; imagining that, by many properties, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, actions, and effects, which by this meanes might be fully knowne all at once. But it is not the will of God, neither were it profitable for vs, that ſo ineſtimable a iewell ſhould bee ſo eaſily gotten: who would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme the moſt precious pearles, if ſo be that they lay in the ſtreetes for the vptaking? and if the nature of God were once fully known, how could it afterwardes bee ſo earneſtly ſought and deſired as is m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>We will doo as we may ſir: and if all ſhould faile, I hope that you will helpe at a dead lift, according to your promiſe: but to proceed. Seeing that the true forme of gods nature cannot be had, we muſt take in ſtead of it, ſome eſſentiall propertie flowing from the forme, the which will make thoſe things which are attributed to God, differ from the ſame things as they are in the Angels. For example, knowledge, wiſedome, might and maieſtie, haue place both in God, and alſo in the Angels, yet they are not alike in both: for in the Angels they are, although great and perfect, yet finit, but in god they are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and infinit. So then, if we adde this difference of infinitneſſe to the Angelicall nature, there will come forth a diuine nature, which may not vnfitly be deſcribed an ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical nature euery way infinit: and ſo God be defined an infinit Angell, as an Angell may be ſaid to be a ſpiritual man. For as ſurpaſsing excellencie doth diſtinguiſh the Angelicall nature from the humane (for although they bee both of one kinde, to wit, reaſonable, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with wit, knowledge, wiſedome, and will, yet they differ, in that the Angelicall nature hath all theſe in farre greater meaſur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1440:42"/>
doth diſtinguiſh the diuine nature from the angelicall, for they both being rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable or vnderſtanding natures, indued with wit and will, and with all things belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there vnto, differ in this reſpect, that the one is excellent in vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, knowledge, wiſedome, will, power, puritie, and glorie, but the other is infinit in all theſe reſpects: the one hath all theſe things in an excellent meaſure, the other hath them without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: the one hath much, the other hath all. And thus by gathering the nature of God out of his workes and word, by finding out a patterne of it in the Angelicall nature, and laſtly, by adding vnto this angelicall nature that wherein it commeth ſhort of God, we haue in ſome ſort made vp the diuine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or rather indeuoured to do that, which it is impoſsible to performe: for in this caſe, the leaſt glimſe of the truth is to be eſteemed knowledge.</p>

Yet for ſo much as fewe can clime vp to the toppe of this high hil, for that fewe off vs that are vnlearned, are ſo well acquainted with the angelicall nature, as to haue any certaine idea or notion of it ſetled in our mindes, I doubt that his demonſtration of the diuine nature by the angelicall, which indeed, and to thoſe that are learned, is the moſt fit and direct that can be imagined, will to vs (who for the moſt part either doubt whether there bee any ſuch thing as an Angel in the world, or if we beleeue the ſcripture, telling vs that there are ſuch ſpiritual creatures, yet we know no further of them, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as we haue ſeen them

And without queſtion, it is the ſafer and the better courſe, whenſoeuer we thinke of God, and therfore muſt of neceſsitie coin in our minds ſome idea or forme of him, to reſemble him to this inuiſible bodie, then to any beaſt or man, to the ſunne, moone, ſtarres, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther viſible creature.

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:1440:45"/>
compariſon betweene this or any other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and God the Creator, but onely a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance, which may bee, where there is no ſhewe of equalitie. As in this inſtance the ayre is to our ſence and capacitie, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of other creatures, ſubtile, ſimple, pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, inſenſible, mightie, large, and vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall: but in compariſon of the diuine nature, it is more groſſe, confuſed, blunt, palpable, weake, narrowe, and wanting, then can bee ſaid. And therefore in reſembling God in word or in imagination, either to Angels, or to the ayre, wee muſt remember to adde the difference, for otherwiſe wee commit groſſe and hainous idolatrie. For there is no creature in the world, which howſoeuer it be perfect in the owne nature, yet if it be vſed as a reſemblance of God, will not bee found wanting in many reſpects. Man is indeed the image of God, yet he is too little and weak, to fill his chaire of eſtate, yea indeede too groſſe for that purpoſe, how ſoeuer it hath pleaſed Gnd ſometimes to reueale himſelfe to <hi>Moſes, Daniell, Eſay, Exechiell,</hi> and other of his Prophets, in the likeneſſe of a man, for ſome reſpect and ſignification. The Angels are not litle, weake, and groſſe as man is, yet before we can make them a fit type of God, me muſt ſtretch them far beyond their owne
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:1440:46"/>
compaſſe, euen throughout the whole world. The aire is large and vniuerſal, but it wanteth life, ſence, and an internall beginning of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: howſoeuer it moue as nimbly as if it had a thouſand liues: annd therefore to make it a fit reſemblance of God, wee muſt inſpire it with life, or rather (if we thinke that life is not properly attributed to God) with reaſon and vnderſtanding, the which without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion doth moſt properly and eſſentially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to God. And ſo we may for the weake capacitie of the vnlearned, deſcribe God, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing him to bee a reaſonable element of aire, as before to the vnderſtanding of the learned, wee made him to bee an infinit An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell. Thus to make vp and finiſh this patterne and picture of God, we are conſtrained to imitate <hi>Apelles</hi> that famous Painter, who going about and enterpriſing by the curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his art and cunning, to counterfaite, yea to ſurpaſſe the perfection of naturall bewtie, would not inſiſt in any one particular, but out of diuerſe perſons, made choiſe of that, which in each one of them ſeemed moſt excellent: taking from one the complection and colour of the eye and haire, from an other the forme and ſtraightneſſe of the noſe: from the third the breadth and largeneſſe of the forehead, &amp; ſo forth, in all the other parts of the viſage, vntill at length, with much ado, he got togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

into one face or countenance an exquiſit and abſolute, idea of bewtie. In like manner we are not to thinke that any one creature is able to affoord ſufficient matter, whereof to make this infinite Image, that doth fill both heauen and earth, or that the ſhop of any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (how excellent ſo euer) hath ſufficient varietie of colours, wherewith to ſet it forth, as the dignitie of it doth require: it is well, if that all the perfections of all the creatures in the world, brought togither into one picture, do make but a reſonable reſemblance of him.</p>

                     <p>Then to tell you plainly, me thinkes that although theſe definitions which you bring, may haue in them ſome ſubſtance of trueth, and alſo ſome plauſible ſhewe of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular facilitie, which I wil not denie, yet they haue no Art in the world in them, and for that cauſe are not onely not curious, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen confuſed and obſcure, and want that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidencie, which you ſeemed in framing them wholly to affect.</p>
                     <p>I haue heard and read many diſcourſes of this matter, yet neuer knew I any take ſuch a courſe, as to define one thing by another, and to inmble vp into one definition, things of diuers natures, as you do in defining god, to bee an infinit Angell, or a reaſonable aire: for thus you make a mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſter of him, as it were
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:1440:48"/>
an Hermaphrodite, halfe of one nature, and halfe of another, halfe reaſonable, and halfe vnreaſonable. You deale with me as men do with naturall fooles, when they cannot make them conceiue that three and foure make ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, but by a mathematicall demonſtration, ſetting ſeuen leauen horſe loanes one vppon another: ſo you heap vp diuers particulars in ſtead of one generall. It had beene a better courſe, if according to the olde and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie manner of handling and defining, in the firſt place you had ſought out the generall kinde or nature: (which you in the Schooler call the <hi>Genus</hi> in definition) to the which the diuine nature doth belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, &amp; is to be reſerred, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue added either the proper form, or (if that could not be found, as I think that in this caſe it cannot) ſom formal proopertie, pointing as it were with the finger at the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne forme. As in this example, you haue found out of Act. 17. 29. the <hi>Genus</hi> or kind of God, to wit, that hee is of the ſame kinde and nature that man is, in reſpect not of his bodie, but of his ſoule: and indeede ſo hee is, God is of a reaſonable nature, for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now thisis but the genus of the definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for both men and Angels are reaſonable natures, and therefore you muſt adde the difference, which diſtinguiſheth God from al other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable natures: but how can you make this infinitneſſe to containe in it, all the attributes of Gods nature I ſee not as yet: and ſo you define God infinit reaſon, or the infinit reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nature.

much truſt my owne wit in conceiuing aright of the nature of God, but that I ſhould bee glad in learning it, to haue the helpe of a type or particular example to direct me. But in one thing, you do me manifeſt wrong, in that you ſay, that I make a monſter of the diuine nature, compounding it of the Angelical, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and elementarie natures. I dare war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant you, that the differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce which was broght, to wit, infiniteneſſe, being put to the definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or to the aforeſaid natures, will ſo purge them, that there ſhall not be one dramme of the droſſe of any created nature left in them. Yea, try it when you will, and you ſhall finde it to bee the right Philoſophers ſtone, which turneth all mettalles into golde, and that one dramme of it being put, not onely to an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, or to a whole element, but euen to the leaſt flye in the world, or the leaſt mote in the Sunne, is of force to make it true and very god.</p>
                     <p>For firſt it maketh it to bee the primary and authenticall nature, or (if this word import generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the eare of a curious grammatiſt) the firſt eſſence deriued from none other, for then it was contained in that other, and then it was finite, for the thing containing, is the limit and bounds of that which is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>

                        <pb n="82" facs="tcp:1440:50"/>
Secondly, this infinitneſſe maketh it to be but one, becauſe there cannot be two infinits: for wher there are two, there is diuiſion of <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                        </hi> one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other: &amp; where there is diuiſion, there is the end of the one, and the beginning of an other, and ſo no infinit. Thirdly, infinitnes maketh the ſubiect to be immateriall, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeall, for no matter or bodie can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit, for a bodie is of neceſsitie contained and circumſcribed by a place, but if it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, then it is not infinit: whereof it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that the infinit thing being without matter, is alſo without paſsion, for <hi>ſola mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria patitur:</hi> and ſo it be commeth alſo immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, for there can be no change without paſsion.

And thus we are to thinke of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine nature, that although it be of the kind of reaſonable natures as ſome creatures are, yet in that it onely is infinit, it is ſufficiently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from them all: and is made firſt primarie or authenticall, without cauſe or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, but exiſting abſolutely in himſelfe,

and of himſelfe. Yea as he is himſelfe without cauſe, or beginning, ſo hee is to all the other things, the cauſe and beginning: hee is the roote and fountaine, from the which all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and beings, do ſpring and proceed: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from him, yet not diminiſhing him, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing all their eſſence, but no part of his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence from him. For this alſo is a proper ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the infinite, to be the originall of all things, the which if they came from any fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite thing, they ſhould at length draw it drie, and ſo the nature or beeing of all the things in the world ſhould periſh, or beeing preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by mutuall tranſinutation, yet they want an omnipotent agent to begin them. For (by the confeſsion of all men) the firſt creation of the world, requireth a power not limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but infinit, for that it is impoſsible to any finite power, to create: that is, to make ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of nothing: &amp; if the power be infinit, the ſubiect wherein it is, muſt be of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Again, God is one and but one, becauſe he is God, to wit, that infint nature, which is ſufficient of it ſelf, to occupie, &amp; fill ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand wordls: neither can abide to be iuſtled by a pewfellow, but muſt ſit and raigne alone: this point of doctrine the whole world, euen the Iewes and Turkes do hold, abhorring all ſound or ſhew of any pluralitie of Gods.</p>

                        <pb n="84" facs="tcp:1440:51"/>
Again, God is immateriall and incorporeall, not exiſting as we do in earthly and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible bodies, or as the Angels doo in ſome more pure, ſolide and firme ſubiects, which may in ſome ſenſe bee called bodies, or in the moſt ſubtile and pure matter that can be imagined, but as a pure actuall and ſubſtantiall forme, ſubſiſting of it ſelfe. And therefore we are (interpreting euery doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing, in the beſt ſenſe) to thinke that <hi>Tertullian</hi> giuing a body not onely to the Angels, but euen to God himſelfe, ment him to be not a phantaſticall imagination, or an accidentall qualitie of ſome other thing, but a true, real, ſubſtantiall, and eſſentiall nature, ſubſiſting as truly and really as doth a body which we ſee and feele. Otherwiſe, by giuing God a body, we take from him his infinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, &amp; ſo his diuine nature, making him lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, mutable and mooueable. The which are in no caſe to bee admitted: for God is not contained in any place, but containeth in himſelfe all places, bodies and natures what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, 1, <hi>King.</hi> 8. 27. How ſhall God dwell in this houſe, when as the heauen of heauens cannot containe and comprehend him? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is he ſubiect to mutation, paſsion or alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as he ſhould of neceſsitie bee, if hee were materiall, but is the ſame this day, and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:1440:51"/>
yeſterday, now and for euer.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, we are not to admit motion in the diuine nature, for that in motion, there is a poſsibilitie of good, or ſome degree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which is not yet in act, nor attained vnto, and ſo there would be imperfection in God: but the diuine nature is not in any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing poſſibilitie tending to any other ſtate, but is euer in complete act and in abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute perfection, and reſteth and remaineth in it ſelfe without motion, far more firme, and ſtedfaſt, then is any Rocke in the ſea, or the earth or whatſoeuer can be imagined moſt immooueable: moouing all things, yet hee himſelfe reſting, for all things tend to him, but he to nothing. Laſtly, the diuine nature is moſt ſimple and vniforme, all alike throughout all: voyde of all mixture, compoſition, combination, diuiſion or diſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude.</p>
                     <p>It is not compounded of matter and forme, for it is a forme needing no matter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to be vpheld, or wherein to exiſt, but vpholdeth it ſelfe, and ſubſiſteth in it ſelfe: In it there is not cauſe and effect, for it is an efficient without an effect, and of that which is no effect, euen of it ſelfe: It is a <hi>totum,</hi> a whole without parts, for it is euery where
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:1440:52"/>
the ſame, and like it ſelf, or rather it ſelfe, and therefore cannot bee diuerſely diuided, or diſtinguiſhed into parts: and if our finite co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations muſt needs make him haue parts, &amp; conceiue him by peecemeale and parts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wee cannot take the whole, then muſt wee needes make euery part to bee the whole: and laſtly, it is a ſubſtance without accidents, for nothing can either accidere or accedere to that which alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is all and infinit, neither doth it, as other ſubſtances do, extenuate it ſelfe into accidentall qualities, but whatſoeuer it ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth foorth from it ſelfe (or rather to it ſelfe, for from it ſelfe it cannot go) that is it ſelfe, not any way extenuated, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in the ſame plight, which it had before.</p>

                     <p>You miſtake my meaning, which was not to exempt God from all logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call relation, and the groundes and rules of reaſon, without the which, I confeſſe, that
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:1440:53"/>
neither the diuine, nor any other nature, can bee either declared or learned, or in truth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt in it ſelfe. For reaſon and logicke, which is the act and operation of reaſon, ſtretch themſelues ouer all things that exiſt, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they exiſt whether finitely or infinitely, although (in vs) it cannot fully compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, that which is infinite, yea and a little further too, euen to thoſe things, which doo not exiſt. As for the diuine nature, it is as hath bene ſaid, an eſſentiall and infinite rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or vnderſtanding, euen the fonndation and fountaine of all reaſon: and therefore, wee cannot thinke that it ſhould aboliſh or deſtroy reaſon, for ſo it ſhould deſtroy it ſelf: but rather are to acknowledge that it doth eſtabliſh it, and agree vnto it. Indeede the grounds and principles of naturall Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie, as they haue bene laid downe by heathen Philoſophers (who hauing little or no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, had the more leiſure to looke into naturall things) doo fight with the grounds of diuinitie, and by not admitting any actuall infinite, do deſtroy the nature of god, as in other points we know, that the beſt Philoſopher that euer was, was but a ſory di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, yet we may not in any wiſe thinke, that reaſon and diuinitie doo iarre or croſſe each one the other, the which indeede are
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:1440:53"/>
both one in effect: and therefore neither I, nor any other (vnleſſe he be voyde both of naturall &amp; alſo of artificial logick) can doubt or denie that God hath ſubſtance, eſſence, nature, forme, yea his proper attributes and effects: and the diſtinction of eſſence and attributes, which all Diuines make in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the nature of god, is good &amp; true. They deny indeed, that there are any accidents in God, and ſay that whatſoeuer is in God, is the eſſence of God, but then they meane by accidents, ſeparable and mutable qualities, and by eſſence, eſſentiall and inſeparable properties.</p>
                     <p>So there are no accidents in God, as in a man or an Angell are knowledge, wiſedome, puritie, holineſſe, ſtrength, and happineſſe, which are no part of their nature or eſſence, nor yet eſſentiall properties, for they may be remoued and ſeparated from their ſubiects, as we know that many both men and angels are ignorant, fooliſh, wicked, vile, weak and miſerable: but nothing that is in god, or doth belong vnto him, can be augmented, dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, or any way altered, for as hee is once at any time, ſo is he alwaies at all times. Yet it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be denied, but that god hath his eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall properties or attributes, and that they are and may be truly and really diſtinguiſhed
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:1440:54"/>
from his ſubſtance, eſſence, or forme, and ſome things (I confeſſe) are attributed to God, in reſpect of our weakneſſe, which are not proper, but rather contrarie vnto the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, as namely, the parts and ſences of mans bodie, as hands, eyes, feete, going, ſeeing, and likewiſe the paſsions and pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations of men, as anger, furie, hatred, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, repenting, forgetfulneſſe, and diuers other: all which are as farre diſcrepant from the nature of god, as darkneſſe is from light: and therefore they are to bee vnderſtood as improper, and metaphoricall ſpeeches, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from our nature, to repreſent &amp; make knowne vnto vs, the diuers actions of God. Againe, God is the Creator, Preſeruer and Redeemer of the world: theſe attributes and many others of the ſame kind, are truly giuen to him, yet they are not to bee accounted his eſſential attributes, becauſe they are not coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall with God: therefore not inſeparable, although creation import omnipotencie, and ſo an eſſentiall attribute. Beſides, there are diuers other things attributed to God, but the true and eſſentiall attributes of God, are thoſe which ariſe and ſpring from his eſſence and forme, as naturally, neceſſarely, directly, continually, and immediately as the beames, light and heate iſſue from the ſun,

As for the methode which diuers Diuines vſe, in putting the knowledge and wiſedome of God among his attributes, in that they put them in the forefront of them, as you ſaye truly, it is plaine that they make them the beginning and foundation of the reſt: yea, I could ſhewe you ſome of the lateſt of them, which make the knowledge and wiſedome of God to be his life: and by life wee knowe that all things are ſaide to exiſt. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, howſoeuer it bee impoſsible for vs to ſound the depth of the diuine eſſence, and to ſhew fully and plainly, wherin the form of it doth conſiſt, yet forſomuch as wee need not doubt, but that of all that is in ſcripture attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to God, and ſaid to be in him, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit vnderſtanding hath the firſt place, both in excellencie, and alſo in order of nature, we may be bold to make it the roote, fountaine, and foundation of his eſſence, and the reſt of his attributes the branches, ſtreames, and progreſſe of it.

But by this meanes you incurre two great inconueniences: firſt in making it finite, the which you confeſſe, although in my minde it is not to bee admitted, for all Diuines make the knowledge of God infinit: and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in making it to bee accidentall, and not of abſolute neceſsit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This will plainly followe, if the knowledge of God be limitted to the things in the world which are knowne: for although it was neceſſary that the world ſhould be created, God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſo decreed, yet this neceſsitie is not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, becauſe God might haue exiſted, though hee had neuer made the world, and then hee ſhould haue wanted this knowledge of things, becauſe the thinges themſelues were wanting.</p>

Yet I will not wholly reiect or deny this deſtinction which you make of the vnderſtanding of God from his knowledge: for although of all Gods at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, his knowledge doth moſt proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and immediately flow from his vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, yet me thinkes that there is a difference to bee put betwixt God and his knowledge, as well as betwixt God and his power: yet for ſo much as through ignorance of Gods true forme, wee are not able to declare the nature of his eſſentiall vnderſtanding, (the which we are conſtrained to put in the place of his forme) heereof it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth, that we are not able to diſtinguiſh this eſſentiall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding

                     <p>Wee are rather to account it to bee a great praiſe and glorie to God, that as hee himſelfe is moſt perfect, ſo he is able to make other things alſo, not onely imperfect (as ſome of the creatures, to wit, thoſe which wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſence, may bee called, although they alſo be perfect in their kindes) but alſo perfect and abſolute in themſelues, able to mooue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues (within the compaſſe of their naturall power) when and as it pleaſeth themſelues, without any outward helpe whatſoeuer. Let vs ſuppoſe (for wee may reade of ſuch a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) that ſome cunning Mathematican made a doue of wood, or ſome ſuch matter, which could flie out, and returne to him home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: ſhould hee thinke it a diſgrace vnto him, that this doue needed not his helpe, or that hee ſhould carrie it abroad, when as it could flie of it ſelfe: and not rather thinke it a matter of incomparable praiſe, that hee could make ſuch an abſolute and admirable
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:1440:71"/>
peece of worke? yes ſurely, for the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and abſoluteneſſe of the worke, doth not detract, but addeth to the praiſe of the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: as no doubt but that it is a great glorie to God, that all the creatures in the world mooue, preſerue, and increaſe themſelues, by the ſole means of that vertue &amp; ſtrength which hee put into them in the beginning, without any other ſupply or ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, althogh without queſtion, they do many waies both need &amp; feele his helping hand. Yet hath not the creature hence any matter of boaſting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt god, for that all that abſoluteneſſe and perfection, which it hath, came not of it ſelf, but from God: who as hee gaue it, ſo hee is able to take it way, and as hee made all the creatures of nothing, ſo alſo to conſume them all to nothing, if it were his will. Beſides, if wee did make the will of God the beginning and fountaine, not onely of his own actions, but alſo of the actions of the creatures, wee ſhould admit many inconueniences and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities: for then all the enormities, mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous confuſions &amp; ſinnes, which are in the world, ſhould bee aſcribed and referred to God, as to the fountain from the which they ſprang. Yea, wee ſhould fall into their here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, or rather extreame madneſſe, who ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the whole world, and all the creatures
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:1440:72"/>
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained in it, to be the bodie of god, &amp; god to be the ſoule of euery liuing thing, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the which nothing can be imagined more groſſe and impious. So then in this compariſon of the will of God with the will of the creature, we ſee in the firſt place, that as God, ſo alſo the perfect, that is, all liuing and moouing creatures, haue their proper wils, not onely diſtinct and diuers from the will of God, but alſo free and abſolute in themſelues, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from being conſtrained or enforced by the authoritie or power of God, yea it may be ſaid truly, if it can bee ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aken and vnderſtood, that the will of the creature is no leſſe free in the own kinde, then is the wil of God, for nothing can bee added to that which is in the higheſt degree. Whereof it commeth, that this freedome of will is alike in all things, in the brute beaſt as in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable man, in men as in angels, in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as in the creator, yea <hi>(ſi paruis componero magna liceret)</hi> in the leaſt flie or weakeſt worme, as in the mightie God of heauen and earth. Not that any creature hath ſo effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall a will as God hath for there is no compariſon between the power of God, and of all the creatures in the world ioyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither in one: as a poore ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not of ſo great abilitie as is a great Lord, yet his freedome
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:1440:72"/>
may bee as great, The creature can doo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but it may will any thing againſt the will of god: the mightieſt creature is not free to doo what it liſt yet the weakeſt is free to do whatit liſt, as can be imagined, euen as the priſoner that lieth bound in chaines in the corner of a ſtraight priſon, is as free in will, as the king that ſitteth on his throne. Freedome therefore is ſo inſeparable and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall a propertie of the will, that it cannot poſsibly by any meanes or power whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, be taken away eyther from the bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh, the reaſonable, or the diuine will. Will may be taken from the creature, &amp; the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture out of the nature of things; yet cannot freedome be taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the will, for it wil fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it, either exiſting or at the leaſt deſiſting with it. Laſtly herein agree the wils of <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                        </hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with the wil of God, rhat all of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther created or vncreated, tend &amp; incline to good, not all to that which is in trueth good, yet al to <hi>y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
                        </hi> which is in appearance good. For as it is the nature of euery thing to preſerue, &amp; to delight it ſelfe, ſo for that purpoſe it eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheweth whatſoeuer ſeemeth euil, and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth it ſelf towards <hi>y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
                        </hi> wich it iudgeth good &amp; pleaſant. And as euery nature is diuers from all other, ſo euery one hath a particular good to the attaining wherof itmoueth it ſelf, and alſo the ſubiect which it hath in ſubiection,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:1440:73"/>
and in the fruition whereof, it reſteth and pleaſeth it ſelfe, as in happineſſe &amp; the chiefe good. Thus the nature of God hath a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per kinde of good belonging to it, the which is ſimply and chiefly good: to wit, his owne glorie, wherevnto the will of God in all the actions of God doth ayme and incline: for in it, riſing out of it ſelfe before the creation, &amp; ſince gotten, or rather continued by meanes of the creatures, it doth reſt and pleaſe it ſelfe for euer.</p>

                  <p>THus farre the will of God agreeth with the will of the creature: now followeth the difference, the which cannot but be great. Firſt they differ in that reſpect, which hath alreadie beene named, to wit, that the will of God is alwaies effectuall and actuall, alwaies bringing it ſelfe into act without faile, or any difficultie, and therefore is neuer in vaine, whereas the creature doth often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline and mooue it ſelfe inwardly towarde ſome obiect, but cannot goe forward in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing and bringing foorth into act that inward motion: being hindred either by the impotencie of the ſubiect wherein it is, or by ſome greater power, but nothing can
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:1440:73"/>
reſiſt the will of God, or make his purpoſe fruſtate. This is the firſt difference, and yet to ſpeake properly, and to ſay the truth, this is not a difference of the wils, but of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and their power: For the wil being hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered from putting it ſelf into executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, may be as ſtrong, yea vſually is more ſtrong then when it hath outward power ioyned vnto it. Secondly, the will of God is immutable and the ſame for euer, that which he willeth once, hee willeth alwaies, but the will of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is more variable then is the winde neuer conſtant, but continually altering it ſelf from one obiect to another, yea often to that which is cleane contrary to the other: &amp; that not onely in particular obiects, but euen in regard of the general kinds of good, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eiecting the true good for a falſe appearance, &amp; with all true happineſſe, for a vaine and tranſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſhadow of pleaſure. Neyther is it any mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, that the will of the creature is ſo varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when as it is ſo eaſily deceiued, and ledde out of the way by error and ignorance, or elſe ouerruled by headſtrong affections, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both which the nature of God being free, admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth no manner of alteration in will. The reaſons which may ſeeme to inferre altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of will in God, are drawne out of thoſe places of ſcripture in the which it is ſaid, that
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:1440:74"/>
God hath not performed, that which hee hath ſpoken and purpoſed: as when he being mooued either with the ſinnes and vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of the wicked, or by the prayers and repentance of the godly, doth confeſſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to repent of that good which hee hath done to the one, or of thoſe afflictions which he had threatned to the other. But the trueth is, that God neuer repenteth himſelfe eyther of the one or of the other but taketh to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the perſon and manner of men, who not foreſeeing what will follow, do often repent themſelues, and are ſorrie both for benefites beſtowed on vnthankfull &amp; vnworthie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and alſo for too great ſeueritie and raſh anger vpon thoſe whom they loue.</p>

                     <p>The anſwere is as you ſay, eaſie &amp; ordinarie, for God willeth and worketh (or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily) nothing but by the ordinarie means effectuall for that purpoſe, the which he hath commanded vs to vſe: and therefore we are to thinke &amp; hope that our endeuours are the meanes which hee hath appoynted for our good. If our endeuors take not effect, we are to acknowledge thoſe wants &amp; harmes to be ſent from God, the which (otherwiſe) we could not haue denied to haue happened through our owne default: and therefore we are to be carefull in vſing all good means ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall for any good purpoſe, and eſpecially of prayer, which you bring for an inſtaunce: for to imagine that God hath ſo tied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to a ſtoicall fate and neceſſarie courſe of things that hee can not, though hee would, grant our deſires, is moſt fond &amp; fooliſh, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:1440:75"/>
                        <hi>God would haue all men to be ſaued, and come to the knowledge of his trueth.</hi> This is true, for it is the word, yea the very words of god, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 4. Againe, it is his wil that ſom ſhould pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, for it is certaine that ſome do periſh, and that neyther without nor againſt the will of God, but by his will &amp; purpoſe, as the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth plainly teach vs euery where. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it was the will of God, that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould not eyther taſte or touch the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fruite, for hee forebad him: and yet wee cannot doubt, but that God had foreappoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould fall by eating the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit, and ſo in infinit other inſtances: for anſwere of all which, wee are to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the commaundements of God giuen to vs from his will, which hee keepeth, to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: he commaunds things impoſsible, to ſhew vs what we ought to doo and to ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor, as is the fulfilling of the lawe, and the conuerting of all men, as farre as we can, to the obedience of the Goſpell: both which are good, and to be endeuored by vs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore commanded by him, but both of them impoſsible, and therefore not to be thought to be willed by him. Againe, God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth ſometimes to this end, to giue occaſion of ſin, for the which end he forebad <hi>Adam</hi> to eate of the fruite of the tree of good and euill, and ſo
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:1440:75"/>
the Apoſtle ſaith, that the law was giuen to make ſin abound: yea God ſometimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth that he wold not haue done, to make triall of our faith, as he commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to ſacrifice his ſonne <hi>Iſaac.</hi> But theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements are not to be accounted the wil of God: yea if hee command any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his written word, this argueth no change or contrarietie in his will, but onely, that God is not nor will bee bound to any law. Laſtly, the wil of God differeth from the will of the creature, in that it onely inclineth it ſelf naturally and neceſſarely to that onely that is good: whereas the willes of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures although they do incline to good only as we ſee in <hi>the</hi> elect angels, yet it is not of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture &amp; neceſsitie, but of grace, &amp; ſo of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencie. For naturally their wil is free as wel to euill as to good, neyther is it poſsible, that the wil of any creature ſhould be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, howſoeuer by grace &amp; the aſsiſtance of God it continue, in affecting only that which is good. But the wil of God doth neceſſarely mooue to good onely, becauſe whatſoeuer God willeth, it is therfore good, becauſe he willeth it, his wil being the ſquare &amp; rule of good, ſo that whatſoeuer agreeth to it, that is good as contrariwiſe, if it diſſent from it, it is to be accounted euill. Hence it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth that
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:1440:76"/>
God when he willeth and commandeth any thing contrary to the morall law, as when hee did bid <hi>Abraham</hi> kill his ſonne, the Prophet <hi>Hoſe</hi> to company with a harlot, and the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes to ſpoyle the Egyptians, or in that he decreeth that their ſhall be ſin in the world, yet in ſo doing, he willeth nothing but that which is good, for by willing it, he maketh it good. Yet in proper ſpeech, theſe actions of men, although commaunded by God, are not to be accounted the proper obiect of the will of God, the which we muſt needs thinke to haue a larger ſcope and obiect, yea a more excellent obiect then are a fewe particular actions of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For the proper obiect of gods will, is that wherevnto it doth totally, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, and naturally incline and tend as wee knowe the obiect of mans will, to bee appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant good and pleaſure, this beeing the ſcope wherat our nature doth wholly ayme, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue it ſelfe in a good and pleaſant eſtate. In like manner the good whereat Gods will doth wholly ayme, is his owne glorie, the maintaining, aduancing and inlarging of it is that which he doth deſire aboue all things, to this end and purpoſe are all his counſelles, creatures and actions to be referred, &amp; in this being obtained, as in his chiefe good, pleaſure &amp; happineſſe he doth delight and reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented.</p>

But that wee may knowe the particulars of this loue of God, it is needfull that wee firſt ſearch out, and conſider the nature of loue in generall, the which may thus after a ſort bee deſcribed. Loue is an inclination of the will to a pleaſan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>This deſcription is to be explained by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging the ſeuerall obiects of loue, or of thoſe things which men do vſually loue, in all which it will appeare that the cauſe why they are loued and ſought vnto, is ſome ſweetneſſe or pleaſure, which may be ſucked out of them, &amp; that nothing is loued, which doth not bring with it ſome delight and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: thus <hi>Iohn</hi> reaſoneth, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 20. <hi>How can he that loueth not his brother whom he hath ſeene,</hi> that is, with whom hee hath conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and ſo might haue taken delight &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure by him, <hi>loue God whom hee hath not ſeen?</hi> and wee read <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. 28. that <hi>Iſaac loued</hi> Eſau <hi>becauſe his veniſon taſted ſweete in his mouth,</hi> and <hi>Leah</hi> ſaith, <hi>Gen.</hi> 29 32. <hi>Now my huſband will loue mee, hauing borne him a ſon.</hi> By theſe and infinite other examples it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that all men incline to that wherein they finde and feele ſome pleaſure and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:1440:80"/>
and this inclination is called the loue of that thing. Yet this is not all in loue, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt adde the ſecond part of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which ſaith, that the pleaſure in true loue procureth a deſire in him that loueth, and enioyeth the pleaſure, to return pleaſure, delight and any good whatſoeuer can bee done vnto it, to the thing loued. For without this mutual relation of pleaſure, it is not to be called loue but rather luſt: as the inclination which men haue to thoſe meates, drinks, and ſuch other things, the which they loue, is not true loue but rather luſt, and thoſe things are properly ſaid to be loued, to the which wee may returne that pleaſure and delight, which wee receiued from and by them, and procure their good, as well as they procured our pleaſure. For example, the inclination which a man hath to an harlot, and to the pleaſure that may bee hadde by her, is not true loue, but onely luſt, becauſe heerein a man hath reſpect onely to himſelfe, and to his owne pleaſure, not caring what become of her, when his luſt is ſatisfied. But the affection which a man beareth to his wife, is of an other kinde, and is true loue, becauſe he doth not reſt in that pleaſure which hee enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by her meanes, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

an earneſt deſire and indeuour, by all meanes poſsible to procure her good, beeing farre more deſirous to pleaſe and profit her, then to pleaſe himſelfe by her: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is not true loue, but ſelfe loue, for true loue hath a hand to giue, as ready yea more ready then one for to take.</p>
                     <p>And therefore meates and drinkes, and ſuch other pleaſant things, although they doo greatly delight vs, yet they cannot bee ſaid to bee loued, becauſe they periſh with the vſe, and though they did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>emaine, they are not capable of any pleaſure or good to bee done in way of requitall, which is the cheefe part of loue. But men are truly ſaid to loue theyr friends, wiues and children becauſe as they doo many wayes receiue pleaſure, comfort, ioy, delight and profit by them, ſo theyr whole deſire is, to returne all that good backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine into theyr boſomes with double inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt.</p>

                     <p>Indeed this is good honeſt dealing, and

                     <p>If you thinke that our Sauiour Chriſt meaneth, that wee ſhould beare as great loue to ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers &amp; to our enemies, as to our friends, you are farre deceiued: for ſo he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy nature it ſelfe, which hath with her owne fingerwritten in our hearts this deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of loue, which I haue brought: to wit, that our loue ſhuld be greater towards them, at whoſe hands we haue receiued pleaſure and comfort, then to them who are ſtrangers or enemies vnto vs. But his meaning is, that to our enemies wee ſhould not bee full of anger and reuenge, but patient, gentle, yea louing and helpful, labouring by good to ouercome their ill: and that by doing good to ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, from whom, or from any in their name, we are neuer like to receiue any retribution, we ſhould ſhewe the faith and loue which we beare vnto God, in obedience of whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement we do that, which of it ſelfe is hurtfull vnto vs. But that a man ſhould loue a malitious enemie as earneſtly as a louing and faithfull friend, a ſtrange and vnknowne woman as well as his owne wife, other mens children as well as his owne, it is not onely not commendable, but euen monſtrous, and contrary both to the light of nature, &amp; to the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:1440:82"/>
law of God. For ſo we ſhould be vniuſt and iniurious to our owne friends, to whom our loue and the duties of it do belong, in beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it vpon others, and in ſuffering them to to reape the croppe where they did not ſowe any ſeed. yea then Chriſtians ſhould endeuour to procure to themſelues, the good will of their brethren, not by duties of loue, but by iniuries, then the which what can bee ſaid or ſuppoſed more abſurd. Now as touching the loue of God towards vs, the which you affirme to come of the free mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his will, not proucked, cauſed, or occaſioned by any good or pleaſure, which he getteth by vs, I confeſſe that GOD electeth to ſaluation without any motiue of goodneſſe foreſeene in vs, euen of hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> mere will and good pleaſure: and that it were mere madneſſe to imagine, that there is any thing in vs or in any creature, by the which we might eyther pleaſure or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit God: yet I anſwere you, firſt that we are to diſtinguiſh betwixt the election, and the loue of God, for God chuſeth and predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nateth to loue of his owne mere will, but hee loueth not, but for ſome cauſe. For as his loue is in the generall notion inclined to good, &amp; not to euill, ſo he loueth nothing but that which is good, yea and hee loueth it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:1440:82"/>
it is good, and for the goodneſſe ſake. If you ſay what is our goodneſſe to God, that he ſhould loue vs for it, what doth it profit or pleaſure him: indeed he ſtandeth in no need of it: yet he taketh pleaſure in it, the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth in the righteouſneſſe of his Saints, their ſins are as eyeſores, &amp; vnpleaſant ſights vnto him. For why God delighteth in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and euery thing in that which is like it ſelfe: he taketh pleaſure to behold his own Image in vs euen as the greateſt ioy &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can haue in any worldly thing, is to behold his owne fauour and faſhions, his owne countenance and conditions, in his ſon. And therefore the more that a man in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe reſembleth god, the more he is beloued of him, as being ſo much, liker to him, as it is ſaid of <hi>Dauid,</hi> that he was a man according to the heart of God.</p>

ſtrange to them that haue not conſidered of it: but the doctrine is, as I thinke, good and ſound, that God neither hateth any but for ſin, neither loueth any but as they are holy.

The proper obiect of Gods loue, is the holineſſe of the reaſonable creature, vnto the which, as being agreeable to his owne nature, God doth encline himſelf by dooing good vnto it, as hee receiueth a kind of contentation in it, and from it. As for the eſtate of the elect before they bee called and ſanctified, we know that whom God lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth once, he loueth alwaies: and <hi>Paul</hi> euen in the heate of his furie againſt Chriſt, was belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of God, as one whom hee had choſen and predeſtinate to beare at the appointed time his owne Image of holineſſe, and ſo the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of holineſſe in him may be ſaid to be the the cauſe of Gods loue, though not of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, For God may chuſe to loue whom he liſt, but hee cannot loue, but according to his owne nature, neither any thing, but that which is in ſome ſort agreeable to his nature: for he cannot loue or like, but muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsitie hate and abhorre euill, as well in

mutuall loue towards God, whom although they cannot by any meanes eyther profit or pleaſure, yet they endeuour with all care to glorifie him by their holy obedience, and ſo to teſtifie that vnfained loue which they beare vnto him. But the vnreaſonable creatures wanting this ſence of the loue and goodneſſe of GOD, and ſo the reciprocation of loue which ſhould bee in them, wherein the force of loue conſiſteth, are for this cauſe not to bee admitted into the participation of the loue of God.</p>

Nay rather wee knowe, that God doth moſt iuſtly hate and abhorre them, for that their perſons are not in regard of theſe reliques of goodneſſe to bee accounted good, becauſe it doth not preuaile in them, but is ouercome and captiuated, or rather aboliſhed by the contrarie corruption of ſinne, the which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the poſſeſsion and commaund of them, ought of right to haue the title and name of them.

But wee will leaue the brute beaſts to their praies, &amp; come to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this doctrine of gods hatred doth

concerne in reſpect of the ſinfulneſſe of their natures, into the which they haue tranſfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med themſelues from that image of Gods holineſſe, wherein they were created. Yet not any meaſure of euill is ſufficient to procure this perſonall hatred, for then God ſhould hate the godly, in whom there are reliques of euill, as there are in the wicked of good, but onely raigning and preuailing euill. It is true indeed, that God hateth the leaſt ſinne that can be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted or imagined, yea almoſt the ſhew of it, and euen the garment ſpotted with the fleſh, yet hee hateth not the perſon in regard of it, it beeing ſuppreſſed and kept vnder, for godlineſſe is ſtronger in them that are ſanctified (thogh imperfectly) &amp; hauing ouercome ſinne, hath wonne the full intereſt of God and his loue. The other thing which you deſired to know before you would come to the queſtion it ſelfe, was the manner of Gods hatred, the which is two folde, inward, and outward. The ſirſt is the true maner of it: the other is the ſencible declaration of the inward, &amp; is indeed the effect of it, as amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt men, outward harme is aſigne and alſo an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of inward hatred.

Then followeth the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward manner, which is the effect and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the inward hatred by bringing or doing euill to the perſon thus polluted with ſinne, from whom God hauing once turned away his face and fauour, it cannot bee, but that all maner of euils, as it were whole legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of diuels ſhould inuade him, as finding him not onely out of Gods protection, as a traitor &amp; rebell, but alſo by gods iuſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment appointed to many kinds of moſt fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full iudgements.</p>

Onely hereby is ment, firſt, for the nature of God, that as he liketh and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooueth the obedience and puritie of the godly, ſo hee miſliketh the impuritie of the wicked as greatly, as men doo thoſe things whereat they are inflamed to anger, which is a certaine ſigne of diſcontentment. And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, for the outward and ſenſible actions of God, that hee vſeth as great ſeueritie (yet not paſsing <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

and paſſe the boundes of moderation in this behalfe: yea if we ſuppoſe (the which wee need not, it beeing ſo common a thing) the moſt outragious blaſphemies and horrible villanies which can be imagined, to bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by men, yet God is not thereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked to anger, or any whit chaunged other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then he was before. He doth indeed ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre ſinne, and puniſh ſinners as they do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, but not in choller, or any violent paſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but by the eſſentiall and eternall motion, or rather immoueable act of his will, ſo affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to theſe obiects, as they doo eyther agree or diſagree from his diuine nature: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this affection in God may more fitly be termed hatred, it being ſo conſtant and inuete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate: to wit, eternall, not a ſudden and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentanie anger. Thus God ſaith, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 10. <hi>Let me alone and I will be angry at this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and conſume them:</hi> that is, I will conſume them as if I were angry: but if this affection of anger had bene truly ſtirred vp in God, he would haue ſaid I am angry, not, I will be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry. Likewiſe for ioy &amp; ſorrow theſe affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons alſo are attributed to God in ſcripture: yet no man is ſo ſimple, as to thinke that they do belong to God in truth: for nothing can happen to him eyther profitable or vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, nothing eyther pleaſant or vnpleaſant:
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:1440:94"/>
or rather nothing, but that which is not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant vnto him, becauſe nothing can bee done againſt his will. But as for pittie and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which is a ſorrow and greeuous ſenſe of the miſerie of an other, that the ſcripture doth ſo earneſtly aſcribe to God, and God in ſcripture ſo carefully challenge to himſelfe, as that wherein his cheefe glory doth conſiſt, that it may ſeeme very hard and not to bee admitted, that ſuch great matters ſhould bee turned into ſhadowes and reſemblances. For ſo we reade, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 19.

                  <p>But the truth is, that there are no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of paſsions in God, his nature beeing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsible:
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:1440:94"/>
onely by the pittie of God in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ment, that God as hee is infinitly and onely good, yea the fountaine of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſo he is moſt prone and ready to impart and extend the ſame to all his creatures, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially vnto thoſe which being miſerable, doo ſtand in greateſt need of his helpe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
                  <p>This may be plainely ſeene in thoſe iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall lawes, which hee gaue to his people by <hi>Moſes,</hi> wherein it may worthely bee noted how carefull the Lord is for the helping and releeuing of all thoſe which are any way diſtreſſed, as namely the poore, the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe, the orphane, and the ſtraunger, that men ſhould not onely take heede of iniury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them any way, (for ſaith he, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 27 although thou bee cruell in oppreſſing thy poore brother, yet <hi>I am pittifull</hi> and cannot abide it, but will puniſh thee for it) but alſo be carefull to releeue them with the crop and vintage of the ſeuenth yeare, and by leauing them ſome gleanings in the yearely harueſt, by ſetting them free out of bondage at the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth yeare.

You know that thoſe good and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſpoſitions of the minde, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called morall vertues, are of two ſortes, whereof the one looketh inwardly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward our ſelues, the other outwardly toward others.</p>
                     <p>The firſt kinde conſiſteth in the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the deſire and vſe of worldly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, as of meate, drinke, eaſe, paſtime, riches, honour, and whatſoeuer elſe is pleaſant in the life of man.</p>
                     <p>Theſe vertues are not to bee attributed to GOD, becauſe his nature is not capable of theſe pleaſures. He indeed liueth or rather exiſteth in the perfection of pleaſure, for hee doth continually and eternally delight and reioyce in himſelfe and in no other thing (in compariſon, as no other thing is to bee compared to him in goodneſſe) for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hee take pleaſure in the goodneſſe of his creatures, whereby they reſemble him, as in their knowledge wiſdome, puritie, bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and whatſoeuer elſe is good in them, yet all this is nothing to that infinit goodneſſe which is reſident in himſelfe, affoording vnto him matter of vnſpeakeable pleaſure, the whieth is not to be limitted within the bounds of any vertues, for it cannot haue either defect, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration or exceſſe, and al, for that it is infinit.
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:1440:97"/>
And what maruell is it, if God be exempted from theſe vertues, and the pleaſures which are the obiects of them, when as the Angels, which are creatures, are not ſubiect vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? for they cannot be ſaid to bee eyther tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in regard of meate and drinke, or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in reſpect of bodely pleaſures, for that their nature is not capable of thoſe pleaſures, no more then are trees or ſenceleſſe ſtones. Yet theit nature is capable both of vertue and alſo of vice: for as by vertue ſome of them ſtand in happineſſe, ſo by vice many of them fell into miſerie: to wit, through ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as it is thought, for deſiring to be higher, they became lower then they were created. This vice (as alſo the vertue of it, which being but the moderation of it, muſt needs be of the ſame kinde with the vice) is incident into all excellent natures: as wee knowe that euery nature doth deſire to increaſe in that good, wherewith it is already endued: yea the more it hath of it, the more it doth deſire, becauſe it feeleth ſo much the more the ſweetneſſe of it, and ſo we ſee it to come to paſſe, that none are ſo deſirous of riches, as is the richeſt, of knowledge, as are the beſt learned: and of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie: as thoſe that are alreadie moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, euen as the fire, the pureſt of all the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements, doth neuer reſt, till it be aboue all
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:1440:97"/>
the reſt, and in the higheſt place of dignitie Yea as the vertue which is care of credit and honour, and alſo the exceeding extreame, which is ambition, ſo alſo humilitie (which may ſeeme to be the lower extreame, but is in truth, the higheſt and moſt excellent vertue) may be moſt plainely ſhewed, and fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in that nature which is moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. For as none can haue ſo great a fall, as he that hath the higheſt place, ſo none can ſhewe ſo great humilitie, as he that is moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, becauſe none can debaſe himſelfe ſo far, as he that is higheſt in excellencie. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it may be gathered, that although God cannot be ſaid to bee ambitious in deſiring greater honour then is due vnto him for that he hath by right, all honour that can bee ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had or deſired, yet we may truly ſay that he may haue both the greateſt humilitie in laying aſide the greateſt excellencie, and alſo a due care of credit and of maintaining his iuſt honour againſt al vniuſt vſurpers whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer.</p>
                     <p>Thus the ſcripture teacheth vs, that God is not onely carefull, but euen curious, as wee may ſay, and as it ſelfe ſaith, iealous of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, the which he cannot abide that it ſhuld bee any touched or impared, as hee doth openly profeſſe of himſelfe, <hi>Eſ.</hi> 48. 11. <hi>My</hi>

                     <p>I haue often thought vpon occaſion of heating this doctrine, that the puniſhment due vnto the leaſt ſinne, is by the iuſtice of god eternal death, that ſome Atheiſts might ſay of Gods lawes, as it was ſaide of <hi>Dracos</hi> laws giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Athenians, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with blood, &amp; wold accuſe God of cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, for infflicting ſo great or rather ſo endles and infinite a puniſhmen vpon ſmall ſinnes, yea vpon thoſe which may be doubted whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be ſins or no, as namely to let paſſe the inward thoughts and deſires, (the which although they bee actuall, yet they are in the loweſt degree of act that can bee) originall ſinne in infants, the which is eyther <hi>alienum,</hi> another mans, and therefore not iuſtly impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or if you take it as it is inherent in themſelues, it is but an inclination to ſinne,

                     <p>I am not of your opinion, or rather that opinion which you name, that it were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtice in God, to puniſh a righteous man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither voy de of ſin: for not to alleadge the promiſe and couenant of life, which god hath made to man beeing righteous, but to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that God had not bound himſelfe by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:1440:102"/>
ſuch promiſe, the abſolute power of God ouer his creatures, will indeed bee a warrant vnto him, not onely to diſpoſe of them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own pleaſure, but euen to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al to naught, as in the beginning he made them all of naught, but yet not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict extream puniſhments where there is no ſinne: for ſo God ſhould doo that which is contrarie to his owne nature, the which doth neceſſarely incline it ſelfe towards the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the creature, by doing to it not euill but good, and therefore hee ſhould doo euill and that which is vniuſt, or rather hee ſhould do that, which it is impoſsible for him to do.

dignities and commodities, whatſoeuer they did enioy by the liberalitie of the Prince, or yet within his dominions.

Yet there is a difference betwixt their ſuffering, and the ſuffering of Chriſt, who did ſuffer for this end, to ſatiſfie Gods iuſtice for the ſins of the elect, the which they cannot do either in whole or in part: for if they were put to ſatiſfie Gods iuſtice but for the leaſt of their ſinnes, they ſhould ſuffer not onely tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, but alſo eternally, and ſo ſhould periſh: but Chriſt onely ſuffereth for the ſatiſfaction, and they for the declaration of Gods iuſtice.</p>

                  <p>THere remaineth now to be conſidered in a word or two, the laſt knot of diuine vertues conſiſting in Gods naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to do good vnto his creatures: they may be called by the generall name of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to the which his general fauour to all, his particular friendſhippe with ſome fewe and his fidelitie or faithfulneſſe both to the one and to the other, may bee referred. For as hee is onely good, that is, the firſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and ful treaſure of all good things, ſo he doth not enuiouſly keep it wholy to himſelf, but doth graciouſly impart it to others, euen to all liuing things, baſe and excellent, good and euill, reaſonable and vnreaſonable, one
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:1440:108"/>
and other, all of them doo eyther drinke or taſte of this ſweet cuppe of Gods goodneſſe and bleſsings. Hee ſuffereth his raine to fall vpon the iuſt and vpon the vniuſt, hee feedeth and filleth all thinges liuing with a plentifull hand, there is no ende or meaſure of his goodneſſe. For why, he hath a fauour vnto them, as a father hath to his children, and as a ſkilfull workeman to the workes of his owne handes, wherein his nature and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, or his ſkill and cunning do plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.</p>
                  <p>Yea, ſo great is his goodneſſe towardes them, that hee vouchſafeth to enter into bondes and couenants with them, binding himſelfe to them by promiſes and oathes, for the performance of that good vnto them, which commeth from him, not as of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie and by conſtraint, or yet by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, but onely of meer fauour and his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall goodneſſe. In the performance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hee is ſo ſure, yea ſo carefull as wee ſee honeſt men to bee in keeping their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, that the whole worlde ſhall ſooner faile, then any iot of that which hee hath promiſed. Whereof we may gather, how odious to God is the impietie of thoſe men or rather blaſphemous monſters, that are
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:1440:108"/>
not aſhamed to call into queſtion, if not flatly to denie, the trueth of that which God hath from time to time promiſed to his Church, as touching eternall happineſſe in the world to come: yea, and that the faithfull themſelues, while they often doubt within themſelues of the trueth and fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of GOD, in making good whatſoeuer hee hath ſpoken, doo no doubt greatly both diſpleaſe and diſhonour God.</p>
                  <p>But moſt of all in this kinde, wee are to admire the friendſhippe and familiaritie which it pleaſeth God to haue with men, yea with ſinfull and mortall men, to ſome of whom hee vouchſafeth not onely this generall fauour, whereof all the creatures in the world are partakers, and that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall loue which bringeth with it eternall ſaluation, but alſo a more ſpeciall fauour, admitting them into his ſecret counſell and acquaintance, as men doo ſome ſpeciall and approoued friends.</p>
                  <p>Thus wee reade that <hi>Enoch</hi> walked with GOD, that <hi>Moſes</hi> did ordinare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly talke and conferre with him face to face, as one friende doth with an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: thus he did (as it were in ſporte) fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly wraſtle with <hi>Iacob,</hi> and continually
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:1440:109"/>
both accompany and aſsiſt him: thus he was to <hi>Dauid</hi> as a Counſeller, to direct him in all his affaires, and thus hee tooke <hi>Paul</hi> vppe to heauen, and ſhewed him things not to be vttered. But of all other, moſt notable in this reſpect was <hi>Abraham,</hi> called often in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by the name or rather by the moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and glorious title of Gods friend, as 2: <hi>Chro.</hi> 20. 7. <hi>Eſ.</hi> 41. 8. <hi>Iames</hi> 2. 23. And in trueth ſo might hee well bee called, for God did both make and keepe with him very ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnely, all the lawes of true friendſhip. For firſt hee made a couenant of perpetualloue, with him and with his ſeed for euer, calling <hi>Abraham</hi> Gods friend. and himſelfe <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> God. Secondly, hee did beſtowe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him all his bleſsings both temporall and ſpirituall, yea the greateſt honour that could bee, namely to bee as it were the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Church and choſen people, and the firſt of the progenitours of Chriſt. And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hee did impart to him his purpoſes and counſels in all things that did any way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne him, or might make for his good.</p>
                  <p>Yea, wee reade that God was ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the performance of this dutie (for ſo it pleaſeth God to binde himſelfe in duties to men) of friendſhippe, that beeing
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:1440:109"/>
about to deſtroy thoſe wicked Citties of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> and <hi>Gomorra,</hi> he thought it needfull to impart the matter to his friend <hi>Abraham,</hi> yea to haue his aſſent for the doing of it. Thus it pleaſeth God of his mercie and goodneſſe to exalt wretched men to this higheſt degree of honour, which indeed is ſo high, as that the Angels in heauen do ſeldome attaine vnto it. So that in this reſpect, and in many other heretofore mentioned, wee may well burſt forth with the Prophet. Pſal. 8. 5. And ſay, what is man that thou that art the great God of heauen and earth ſhuldeſt remember him, or the ſonne of man that thou ſhouldeſt thus viſit him.</p>

You know that men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue things by imagination and retaine them
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:1440:110"/>
by memory, are theſe faculties in God? like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, conſcience in man is a diſtinct facultie, or rather an act of the mind, and there are in him diuers affections, as ioy and greefe, and diuers vertues not as yet mentioned, what are we to thinke of theſe things?</p>

                     <p>I hope you do not looke to heare at this time, whatſoeuer might be ſaid of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God: you are not now ſo deſirous, but if that were taken in hand, you would bee as wearie of hearing, ere it were halfe done: if the cheefe matters be declared, they will giue ſufficient light, whereby the reſt may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, and ſo by thoſe which haue beene handled, you may eaſely vnderſtand the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the reſt of thoſe good affections, and vertuous diſpoſitions, which are in ſcripture attributed to God. So for the eſſentiall facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the ſoule, you ſay very truly, that they are moſt like to the diuine nature, and euen a plaine and expreſſe Image of it: yet this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference muſt be noted, that whatſoeuer thing is in them that argueth weakeneſſe or ſuture poſſibilitie, that hath not truly place in the diuine nature, which is a perfect and complete act. As in theſe particulars which you haue named, imagination is but a poſſibilitie or meanes of knowledge, but the knowledge of God hath beene ſaid to bee eternall and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall.</p>
                     <p>

It is hard, I confeſſe, and euen impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for vs to ſee or imagine how all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars in the world ſhould exiſt actually in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vnderſtanding from all eternitie, but wee muſt not meaſure the infinitneſſe of Gods vnderſtanding by our ſhallow braines. But as touching the queſtion which you mooue of imagination and the meanes and manner of knowledge in God, how the ideae or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of things enter into his mind, or rather how they exiſt eternally in it without any entering in or beginning, firſt it muſt bee helde, that although they exiſt eternally in GOD, yet they are not eſſentiall to him, that is, ſo naturall and neceſſary as that without them he could nor exiſt, as is the knowledge of himſelfe and the idea of his owne nature, yea all the reſt of Gods eſſentiall attributes, of all which if wee ſhould detract but one from God, wee ſhuld quite deſtroy and ouerthrow his whole nature and eſſence.</p>
                     <p>But the knowledge of the creatures is not of that kinde, for God beeing in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe abſolute and all ſufficient, might haue (if it hadde ſo ſeemed good vnto him) exiſted without euer eyther making or knowing any creature, and therefore the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:1440:111"/>
knowledge of them in God, muſt be thought to ariſe not from the abſolute neceſsitie of his nature, but from the free libertie of his will, moouing (yet eternally) his vnderſtanding to this actuall knowledge of the creatures. Yea that as the knowledge oridea of his own nature is (according to <hi>y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
                        </hi> order of nature, not any difference of time) firſt in the eſſentiall vnderſtanding of God, and then in his will, ſo the knowledge or idea of the creatures hath his beginning not in the vnderſtanding but in the will of God. This difference we haue and ſee more plainely in our ſelues, for as we haue ſome general notions engrauen in our mindes by nature it ſelfe, and ſo in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner both bred and borne with vs without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny helpe of our wils, ſo the knowledge of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things hath the beginning in the will, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing and inclining the minde to this or that knowledge, as it ſeemeth beſt vnto it. Secondly as touching this (in a manner acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall) knowledge of God, it muſt bee held that God hath it of himſelfe and not by the means, or from the creatures, as we haue, that by ſence and imagination get the reſemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of things into our mindes, the which way of knowledge if it were admitted to bee in God, it would follow, that his knowledge of the creature doth not go before, but follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:1440:111"/>
after it and ſo is not the cauſe but rather an effect of it, and not eternall but temporall, whereas wee holde that the will and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall foreknowledge of God are the cauſe of all things.</p>

                     <p>I haue heard it ſaid, that the diuine nature is as it were a Glaſſe, wherein al things that do at any time exiſt in the world, may be ſeene and knowne, and that by the Saints and Angels in heauen, much more then by God himſelfe, who knoweth all things by his owne eſſence, it being the ſimilitude of all things.</p>

                     <p>Some haue thought as you ſay, but it is a mere fable to ſay that eyther the Saints or the Angels do or can ſee the eſſence of God, much leſſe all things in it. It is true that God knoweth all things, and that by his eſſence, if thereby we meane his eſſentiall vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and that by the ſimilitude which his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall vnderſtanding hath to the creatures, if thereby wee meane the ſimilitude which is betwixt the generall idea or notion and the particular inſtance. For as it is eſſentiall and naturall to God to know himſelfe, ſo it is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall and natural to him to know the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall differences of things, without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge whereof he could not knowe himſelfe. As namely it is eſſentiall to God to know

                     <p>I am far from that abſurd error, and I hope from any ſuch: I do not doubt but that God knoweth euery particular thing in the world ſeuerally and diſtinctly from all other, yea, that hee hath in his eternall counſell di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed them, as namely men, of whom he hath appointed ſome to glory and others to confuſion: yea, that he knoweth euery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular thing farre more diſtinctly and truly then we do, that ſee and feele them: for hee knoweth them in their cauſes, and eſſentiall formes, the which only is the true knowledge, whereas we do but geſſe at their natures by their qualities and effects.</p>

                     <p>We cannot ſay, if we ſpeake proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that God knoweth any particulars, but thoſe which do ſometime exiſt. He knoweth himſelfe able to make ſuch particulars, if it were his will, but they are not particulars, vntill his will do bring them into act: for as vniuerſall notions are in Gods vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding as in their firſt fountaine, or rather in their proper place, ſo particulars come from the will of God: And therefore wee muſt needs thinke that God knoweth thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars which do or ſhal exiſt, or haue exiſted otherwiſe then thoſe which doo neuer exiſt, for hee knoweth the one and not the other.</p>

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:1440:114"/>
vnderſtanding is merely actiue not paſsiue: yet wee cannot doubt, but that as God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs to perceiue things by ſence, and the Angels by ſome other meanes, ſo hee is able by meanes to make himſelfe capable of the qualities of particular obiects, but of himſelfe and in his owne nature, hee is altogither vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of them, or of any knowledge by them.</p>

                     <p>You haue no liſt to anſwere me di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the queſtion: I do not thinke that God doth ſuffer from the obiects, but that is all one, I would know whether that hee doth not know and ſee vs, as we go here other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then he did, when we were in the loines of our firſt father <hi>Adam,</hi> and whether that he doo not plainely ſee vs two particularly and diſtinctly, whether he do it <hi>intromittendo,</hi> as we doo, or which is more agreeable to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being impaſsible) <hi>extramittendo,</hi> that is not the queſtion: but I cannot be perſwaded but that although hee knoweth vs fully and certainely before we exiſt, yet when once we do exiſt in nature, he then doth ſee &amp; behold vs after an other manner.</p>

                     <p>You ſay true, I haue no minde to wade farre into this matter, for it is very hard, yea impoſſible for vs to know the manner of the actual knowledge of God: and therfore I did
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:1440:115"/>
paſſe it ouer in the proper place, neither wold I haue mentioned it but that you vrge mee ſo hard: for I thinke it ſufficient for vs to know that God knoweth all things, euen the moſt ſecret thoughts of our mindes, although wee be ignorant how he commeth to that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. But for your queſtion I haue told you my opinion, that howſoeuer you ſeeme to thinke that God knoweth things not exiſting and ſeeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as it were with eyes, when they do exiſt, yet it ſeemeth more conſonant to the truth to ſay, <hi>y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
                        </hi> the creatures whither exiſting or deſiſting, are all alike knowne to God, and I pray you reſt in this anſwere, for this time. Now as touching memorie, as God hath no vſe of imagination, becauſe he hath nothing to learne, ſo he hath no need of memorie, for that he cannot looſe any thing by forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, all things being preſent vnto him both paſt &amp; future. Likewiſe for conſcience, which is the teſtimonie giuen by the minde in the preſence of God of the innocencie and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie or of the guiltineſſe of this or that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creature, and ſo eyther of the want or of the deſert of blame, it may in ſome ſort bee attributed to God, and that in reſpect both of himſelfe as alſo of the creature: for firſt, God as he is in all reſpects moſt pure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, yea moſt holy and good, ſo before
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:1440:115"/>
himſelfe and in his owne preſence, hee both knoweth and acknowledgeth himſelfe ſo to be, and for that cauſe not onely to be free fio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all deſert of blame, but alſo to deſerue moſt worthely al praiſe and glory. But more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this facultie hath vſe in reſpect of men, who do often charge God with euill, iniurie, iniuſtice, crueltie, and many other grecuous crimes, in the which plea this facultie of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience doth cleare and abſolue God, from all thoſe blaſphemous reproches which wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched men ſpew out againſt him. Rom. 3. 4. <hi>Let God be true and euery man a lyer that thou mayeſt be iuſtified in thy ſayings, and ouercome when thou art iudged.</hi> Thus much of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the minde, which you thought o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the former diſcourſe: as for the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and vertues, as ioy greefe, and diuers other, which in ſcripture ate often attributed to God, their nature may be knowne by thoſe which haue bene handled.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hus I haue declared vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, thoſe things which for the preſent I could call to my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance as touching the nature of God, his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, eſſence, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, eyther truly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or typically borrowed from the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a reaſonable ſoule. To the which if you adde the externall attributes which are borrowed from the body or outward per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of man, as is the eternitie of GOD from the age or continuance of man, his vbiquitie from the greatneſſe or ſtature of man, his omnipotencie from the ſtrength of man, with others of the ſame kinde, you haue a perfect picture of the nature of God ſhadowed out, though rudely and imperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, vnder the ſhape of man.</p>
               <p>This laſt kinde of attributes hath beene touched already in ſpeaking of the infinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God, the generall and eſſentiall dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference

ſo we ſhal haue the more time for conference but for our lodging wee will not trouble our ſelues as yet, but rather take it as we finde it, and therfore I pray you let mee heare and knowe ſomewhat of theſe alſo in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and firſt why you call them externall attributes.</p>

                  <p>I hope your meaning is not that we ſhall go reaſoning into the towne, for ſo we ſhould haue moderatours inow to cut vs off: but to ſhut vp theſe things breefely: They are called externall, not as if there were any ſuch difference of externall &amp; internal in god as in man, conſiſting of an outward body and an inward ſoule, for in God there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without nor within, but all alike: but they are ſo called in GOD becauſe they are ſo in truth in man from whoſe nature the reſemblance is taken. Yea further they may bee ſo called, howſoeuer they bee as eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall as the other: for that they doo not come ſo immediately from the roote of Gods eſſence, which is an infinit vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, neither ſo properly belong to the nature of it, but are as it were, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by the coniunction of the difference which is infiniteneſſe to the eſſentiall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of GOD: the which bringeth forth knowledge, wiſedome, will and the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:1440:117"/>
reſt of the aforeſaid attributes, more natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and properly then it doth eternitie and vbiquitie, the which are found onely in this one vnderſtanding, whereas the other are common to al vnderſtandings, both finite and infinit. And therefore we may truly ſay that the infinit knowledge of God is more inward and neare the vnderſtanding which is the root of Gods eſſence, then is his infinit continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, although not more eſſentiall: euen as we ſee that thoſe parts of a tree, which are nearer the roote, may be ſaid to be the inner parts, and the ſmal twigs the vtter parts, altho the one bee no more eſſentiall to the tree then the other. Now for the particulars: and to begin with the eternitie of God which is his euerlaſting age or continuance, repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to vs, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 9. by an old aged man, whoſe head and haire are as white as ſnow, or <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                     </hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt wolle, the which teſtifieth that hee is no babe of yeſterdaies birth, but that he hath li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and continued in the world many yeares: euen ſo it is with god, or rather ſo it is not with god, for the oldeſt man that is had a time of birth and beginning, tho long ſince, and ſhall haue a time of end euen hard at hand but god is without father or mother, and hath neither beginning of dayes nor end of life, but is the ſame this day, yeſterday &amp; for euer. He is not by
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:1440:118"/>
the gray or white hayres of olde age ſummo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the court of death, for he is alwaies in his freſh and flouriſhing youth: his ſubſtance doth not weare and waſte away, for it is not as are the bodyes of men, as a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome deuided in it ſelfe, which therefore cannot ſtand but is ſimple without mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or diuerſitie, and therefore without iarring, yea all perill and peraduenture of ruine.</p>
                  <p>So then this eternitie of God is to bee defined, the euerlaſting exiſtence of his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence without eyther beginning or end. For if it had beginning, then it did not alwaies exiſt, for it could not exiſt before it hadde a beginning: And if it did not alwayes exiſt, then ſometime there was nothing, but that cannot bee, for if there were time, there was diſtinction of motion which made that time, but where there is nothing, there is no motion, for nothing cannot mooue.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, if the time euer were, wherein there was no thing nor nature exiſting (for if God were not exiſting there was nothing, for whatſoeuer did then exiſt was god, becauſe it did primarely exiſt) nothing ſhould euer haue exiſted: for if the Philoſopher could not ſee how the moſt mightie and omnipotent
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:1440:118"/>
God could make <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                     </hi> firſt matter of the world, for that hee had nothing whereof to make it, and iuſt nothing ſaith hee, (though falſely) is made of nothing, what would hee ſay to this paradoxe, that nothing did of nothing make ſomething, yea all things, not onely materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all bodies, but euen the moſt pure and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue formes? But wee knowe that God is eternall, that is, hee euer was, and neuer was not, hee was not made by nothing, for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing makes nothing, nor by any thing, for that which could make God, was before god and greater then God, and therefore onely God: but God made himſelfe, not by giuing or rather by taking a beginning to himſelfe, but by being himſelfe, as he doth ſtill, and ſhall for euer make himſelfe. Hee was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, as hee will bee euermore, neuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, nor euer ending, but alwaies being. Hee exiſteth not of nothing, but of himſelfe, not by another, but by himſelfe, in no other but in himſelfe, and for no other but for himſelfe, and ſo hee is to himſelfe all in all. Yea as God is eternall, ſo euerie eternall is God, for no creature can bee eternall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe with the creature there comes in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and motion, &amp; with motion time, and ſo eternitie is abandoned: for time and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie are contraries, as are finite and infinite,
.
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:1440:119"/>
the meaſure and that which is vnmeaſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But (you may ſay) how could God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt without the creature, for how could hee exiſt without working and doing ſomething, he being a moſt actuall and operatiue forme, and how could hee worke, if hee had no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to worke on? how could God extend his goodneſſe, there beeing nothing to receiue it, or how could hee haue glorie and honour, there beeing none to giue it, for honour is in the giuer, not in the taker? or what diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would it haue beene to God, if hee had made the creature to exiſt from all eternitie, more then it is that hee will make it to exiſte to all eternitie, as wee knowe that hee hath promiſed in holy ſcripture? yes ſurely, God is not pind vpon the ſleeue of the creature, that hee could not exiſt and that in perfect happineſſe and glorie, without the helpe or company of any creature, the which howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it do ſet foorth the glorie of God after another manner, then that wherby God was glorious in and to himſelfe ftom all eternitie, yet it addeth nothing to the perfection of Gods glorie, which before was abſolute, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not in the ſame manner. Neyther can wee doubt but that this eternitie of the creature would bee a great blot to the glory of God, wherof his eternitie is now a notable
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:1440:119"/>
part, but ſhould not bee if that the creature were eternall as well as God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt bee content to bee a degree beneath him, rather then to ſtriue in vaine to fetch the pedigree from ſo auncient a ſtocke: eternitie muſt be left to God as a royall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue proper to his houſe and crowne, for the antiquitie of a fewe thouſand yeares may ſerue to make <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                     </hi> creature noble. Now that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which ſaith, that God could not exiſt without the creatures, becauſe without the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he could not worke, is eaſely anſwered: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the creation, God did no way mooue or worke: yet he was not idle, for hee did as hee doth ſtill, giue himſelfe to the contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of himſelf, euen of his own infinit eſſence and glorie.</p>

We ſee how the ayre (to the which wee haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore compared the vbiquitie of God) is deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to inlarge his dominions, and therefore aſſoone as euer it findeth any place emptie, it ſtraightway taketh poſſeſsion: but if there be any bodie in it to keepe poſſeſsion, it is kept out a doores, and can haue no title to it: and ſo in all other bodies wee ſee that the weaker giueth place to the ſtronger, for it is impoſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that two bodies ſhould bee togither in one place. But it is not ſo with God, for no creature is able to put him out of any place: hee doth ſuffer the creatures to haue their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall places, but not to vſurpe his place, the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:1440:120"/>
which is euery place, as well where the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are, as where nothing is. For their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in place doth not hinder him from being there, for he is there as well as they, and euen where they are. Hee is where the earth is, for hee is in the earth, and both heauen and earth are in him, and ſubſiſt in him as in their ſubiect and foundation, vpholding and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining them. And therefore his title is better to that place which they haue, then is theirs, for hee was there in peaceable poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it, before they were any where exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, and ſo he will bee there when they are conſumed to aſhes and gone.</p>

profeſſe himſelfe to bee there onely, and no where elſe, ſpeaking according to the errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conceit of men, that thinke him to be no where preſent in eſſence, but where he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelfe and his power by ſome outward ſigne. Thus God was preſent in the Temple of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and more ſpecially in the holy of holieſt, and in the propitiatorie ſeate more then in other places, not by his eſſence but by his mercie and goodneſſe, the which hee did there reueale and ſhew to the Iewes more then to any other people. Thus God is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in his ſpirit in the faithfull, more then in the carnall man, not by the eſſence, but by the effectuall operation of it, reneuing in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his owne image of holineſſe and trueth, the which thing hee doth not in the other. Thus God is preſent in heauen more then in hell or heere on earth not in eſſence, but in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and maieſtie, the which ſhineth more in heauen, then any where elſe. For euen as a man hauing been kept all his life in a darke dungeon from the light of the ſunne, and the ſight of the creatures in the world, if he were on a ſuddaine brought vppe into the open ayre, and ſuffered to behold all theſe glorious creatures, would not ſticke to ſay and affirme, this world to bee the very dwelling place and pallace of God: ſo doth

                     <p>The omnipotencie of God is reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in man by the ſtrength of his bodie, or the power of his perſon, yet there is as great difference, as is betwixt the age of man and the eternitie of God, or the ſtature of man, and the incomprehenſible greatneſſe of god. For as God is, ſo is his power, by the which hee is able and ſufficient to doo whatſoeuer pleaſeth him, as it is defined <hi>Pſal.</hi> 135. 6. <hi>The Lord is great aboue all Gods, and hath done whatſoeuer hee woulde in heauen and in the earth, in the ſea and in the deeps:</hi> &amp; what neede there to bee more power then will, or to what purpoſe is that power, which is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the will. So that the obiect of Gods po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:1440:123"/>
is the whole world, in the which, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the which, God hath ſo ample and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute authoritie, that neither the greatneſſe, ſtrength, nor multitude of the creatur is able to reſiſt his wil and power, who is able (if hee were willing) to turne all things vpſide down, to make the heauen &amp; the earth change pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the one with the other, ſo that the heauen ſhould reſt in the middeſt, &amp; the earth turne about in the circle.</p>
                     <p>Yea as hee made both heauen and earth, and all things in them contained of nothing, ſo hee is able to turne them all to nothing, and that without any labour or difficultie, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by the breath of his mouth, and the meer inclination of his will.</p>
                     <p>But howſoeuer this power of God cannot bee matched by any creature, yet it doth both match and ouermatch it ſelfe, reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it ſelfe ſo, that it is not able to doo any thing againſt it ſelfe, for that which God by his power doth at any time, hee cannot by his power make it to be not done or vndone at the ſame time, for ſo the power of God ſhould bee contrarie to it ſelfe.

And if God cannot make any repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancie in the nature of the creatures, much leſſe can hee doo it in his owne nature, and therfore he cannot do any thing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie vnto it, as namely to iuſtifie a wicked man, or to condemne the righteous, to loue one that is ſinfull, or to hate him that is indued with his owne image of holineſſe, to diminiſh, deſtroy, or any way to alter himſelf, who is vnchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.

For ſo wee ſhould pull downe all that wee haue built vp, and gaineſay all that hath hithertoo beene affirmed of the nature of God. For we cannot make him both eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and alſo compounded of matter and forme, for in compoſition there is motion, &amp; in motion time, and time taketh away eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, yea wee muſt graunt the matter wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

Yea thus wee ſhall take from him his omnipotencie, which ariſeth of the puritie of his ſimple forme beeing mere actuall, becauſe it is inmateriall, whereas if it were compounded of matter and forme, it ſhould be compounded of impotencie and of power, of paſsion as well as of action, for it muſt participate the nature of both the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, taking from the one operatiue power, and from the other paſsible impotencie, and ſo bee not a pure act, but clogged and blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the groſſeneſſe of matter, and by it made vnable to worke, yea as like and readie to ſuffer it ſelfe, as to worke in others.

With this ſimplicitie of the diuine eſſence we may ioyne the vnitie of it, for as it is ſimple without partes, ſo it is one without kindes, neither can we imagin it to be moe then one for many cauſes. For if we ſuppoſe two infinits, wee make no inſinit, for each of the two is the limit of the other, for it

                  <p>THis attribute giueth vs to vnderſtand, that god is not ſubiect to motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is the mutation of ſtate or place, but is in all reſpects immutable and immoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: he doth not ſhift his dwelling place, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring vp and downe like a Pilgrime, this day in one countrey and to morrow in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, at one time in heauen, and at an other time on earth, but continueth where hee is and where hee hath bene alwaies, more firme and ſteadfaſt then the hugeſt mountaine, or the whole earth, like to a Rocke in the ſea, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the which though the waues do beate, and ſo breake themſelues, yet they cannot either moue it in or remoue it out of the place where it is: euen ſo it is with the creatures in the world, the which doo continually toſſe and tumble themſelues from one eſtate to an other, but the Lord remaineth the ſame for euer.</p>

                     <pb n="236" facs="tcp:1440:128"/>
For why, as we our ſelues muſt not ſit downe, but go on till we come to the end of our iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, euen ſo the creatures, when they are in their beſt eſtate, are not there to reſt in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, as if they had made themſelues for themſelues, but they muſt moue and go on towards God and his glory by performing thoſe duties, which do naturally belong vnto them, and ſo continually better their eſtate. But it is not ſo with God, whoſe perfection is and euer was in complete act, not in hope &amp; poſſibilitie, and therefore hauing all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, that he can haue, he need not ſtir for the obtaining of any more, or mooue for any mans pleaſure: his laſt ende and cheefe good is in himſelfe, and in no other thing whatſoeuer, and therefore hee need not by motion purſue that, which he enioyeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in reſt, or ſeeke that from an other which he hath in himſelfe. Yea it is needefull that God ſhould be immoueable, hee beeing the foundation, whereon all things whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer do any way exiſt, do ſtand and rely: ſo that if it did moue and were fickle and waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, there muſt neceſſarely enſue vniuerſall confuſion &amp; diſorder in nature: in the which reſpect (as was noted in the former attribute) God being both <hi>terminus a quo,</hi> and <hi>terminus ad quem,</hi> all naturall motion motion is made,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:1440:128"/>
muſt needs be ſuppoſed to bee vnmoueable. for otherwiſe both diſorder would enſue, and alſo motion ſhould be made to motion, as it were in an endleſſe iourney, and with boote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe labour.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly how ſhould wee suppoſe God to moue, whom we know to haue no place whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to moue: for hee himſelfe is euery where and therefore whither ſoeuer he moueth, hee moueth to himſelfe, or rather he moueth not at all, becauſe he is ſtill where he was, euen in himſelfe. Now ſir, I haue as I could, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured to ſatiſfie your requeſt, neither can you require any more of me, ſaue only thanks for your gentleneſſe and curteſie in atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſo patiently theſe ſimple and rude diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes: your wiſedome is ſuch, that I am perſwaded, you did not expect any perfect declaration of the nature of God, eſpecially at my hands, and at this time: in the which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect I hope that you will take in good part, that which hath bene ſaid, how rudely and rawly ſoeuer.</p>
