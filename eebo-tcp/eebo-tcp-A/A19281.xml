            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Worshipfull, two causes there are which haue moued me to put forth these plaine and vnpolished meditations: the one is the generall good which we haue all receiued from the hand of our graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God in this late great deliuerance of Prince and people, Church and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, from that bloudie and hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish practise of our desperate aduersaries: the other is that particular good which I haue receiued from you, since my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming among you. Concerning the common good which we haue all beene partakers of: surely it hath beene such, and so great, as that if we should holde our peace, the very stones would speake. And therfore that they may not be a witnesse against me, I haue in your hearing spoken of this deliuerance. And because it is required that we should not onely declare the worke of God, but commend it also by writing vnto the generations to come: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue I taken this further paines, to commit to writing such notes as I haue obserued concerning this great worke, that they may be trials of our present thankefulnesse, for the blessings receiued, and furtherances also to strengthen our faith, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish our posteritie, that they may waite vpon the Lord in the affiance of the like mercies.</p>
            <p>And the rather haue I beene incouraged herevnto, by that particular good which from time to time, since my comming among you, I haue receiued from you, that so it might be some pledge of my thankefulnesse vnto you for the same. I may well say you haue comforted my body, and my soule: not onely my
<pb facs="tcp:9124:4"/>
outward man, when I was a stranger to you, and by reason of the visitation of my familie, in some affliction. A kindnesse which by Gods mercy I shall not faile to leaue recorded to posteritie, when opportunitie shall serue: but specially my soule and inward man: in beholding your Order and loue vnto the Gospell. Which though it hath made you stincke in the Nostrels of the common aduersarie: yet hath this sauour of your oyntmens, caused the Saints to loue you: yea the hatred of your enemies hath the Lord recompenced with such extraordinary pledges of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, As that you haue not onely your liues &amp; liberties giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you for a prey, but further also the Lord hath honoured your Cittie with the presence and protection of a gracious Princesse: not onely by making your Cittie an harbour for a season vnto that royall branch, but thereby in mercy opening a way (if you shall accept it) by so comfortable a protection, to the strengthening &amp; continuance of your holy libertie in the <hi>waies of God,</hi> And surely if you shall not vse your libertie as an occasion, to the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hen that which is ready to die, and doe the first workes, and continue therein: you shall vndoubtedly be a sweete swelling sauour in the nostrils of the Lord, and so not onely haue your Cittie blessed with the dew of heauen, and fatnesse of the earth, but by the mercie of God, you shall be lead forth in your most holy faith, to receiue the ends therof euen the saluation of your soules: Which, as I do heartily sigh and long after, so haue I to this end thought fit to stirre vp your pure mindes by these meditations: that you might haue somewhat of mine with you, as a pledge of my thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse vnto you, for your loue towards me: and a Spurre to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke and continue our thankefulnesse vnto God, for his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full mercies, renued and continued vnto vs, in this great deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance: and that herein I may free my selfe from imputation of vanity and negligence, which may happily arise from the strangenesse of the Title, and plainenesse of the matter, giue me leaue (I pray you) to yeeld you reasons of them both.</p>
            <p>Concerning the Title, my purpose is therein to discouer the nature of our aduérsaries, who would haue done vs so great
<pb facs="tcp:9124:4"/>
euill. A very cursed generation, and full of deadly poyson, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly cruell where they can preuaile: and yet by the Iustice of God, breeding their owne bane, when their sinne is full, euen bursting a sunder with the poyson thereof, and iustly confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with their owne malice. So is the Spider, Yea as the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Webbe is cunningly Wouen, and quickly broken, so are and shal be the deuises of our aduersaries: they shall not be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by their iniquitie: but their owne cunning hath and shall be their confusion. And let this satisfie you concerning the Title.</p>
            <p>As for the plainenesse, and rudenesse of the matter, if you doe duly consider the rule of my direction. I trust you will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that the power of the spirit is best seene in weaknes: and that plaine lines, doe best answer a straight and euen leuell: the euidence of the spirit, is best seene in plainenesse. You see I haue informed my selfe in these meditations, by the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Paterne: a Psalme of that Princely Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> that man of afflictions: when his life was indangered by the subtiltie and violence of his close and trecherous enemies. To be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from these, he flies vnto his God in prayer: and the rather to preuaile, he layes before the Lord the desperate practises of his enemies: thereby implying: that vnlesse the Lord stood vnto him, hee iustly feared that they would swallow him vp. This feare of his, is the rather confirmed: because he saw them sod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine and fearelesse in their mischieuous practises: And why they should be thus fearlesse, he discouers in the next words: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they did by many sorts of incouragements meet with this feare. And here begin our meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: deriued as you see fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this pure fountaine: and watered all along with the streames ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. If this heauenly treasure hath so shined in this earthen ves sell, that the excellencie of that power, may appeare to be of God, and not of vs: giue God the glory in the treasure, and be humbled in respect of the vessell. If the vessell hath receiued that honour from this beauenly treasure, as not to haue handled it craftily and deceitfully: but in declaration of the truth shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be approued, to euery mans conscience in the sight of God.</p>

For whereas of all other
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:9124:6"/>
sinnes, the sinne of treason hath cause most to affright the heart of man, not onely in regard of the maiestie of the Prince, who carries the Image of God, full of terror and astonishment to the wicked, but also in respect of the haynous punishment that attends the same, (not to omit <note place="margin">In that this sin beee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth feare.</note> the racking of the conscience in the horrour of the sinne) may it not therefore seeme strange, that wretches should not feare to commit so great a sinne, that Subiects should runne of boldly, and desperately to lay hands vppon the Lords annointed? The Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> was so affected, <note place="margin">1. Sam. 24.</note> when hee had but cut off the lappe of <hi>Saules</hi> garment, a wicked and reprobate King, that his <hi>heart smote him</hi> with conscience of some great euill, <hi>in lifting vp his handa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Lords Annointed.</hi> And when the Amalekite <note place="margin">2. Sam. 1. 15.</note> brought newes vnto <hi>Dauid,</hi> that he had slaine his enemy <hi>Saule,</hi> hoping to receiue some great reward, the good King was so farre from delighting in the death of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, as that rather remembring him to bee the Annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Lord, hee not onely <hi>bewailes</hi> his death with a great lamentation, but further reprooues the <hi>Amalekite</hi> with this seuere checke: <hi>How wast thou not affraide to life vp thy hand against the Annointed of the Lord?</hi> and rewards him with such wages, as so haynous a murther did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. To feare then in attempting against the li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of a Prince, as there is great reason, in regard of the haynous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the sinne, and the Maiestie of the person against whome it is committed, so there had neede be great poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie vsed to banish this feare.</p>
            <p>What this policie was, the holy Ghost proceedes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late vnto vs, in these two verses following: leading vs <note place="margin">Foure Policies of the wicked to giue them encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their mifchiefes.</note> to the consideration of diuers notable points of policie, in the practises of these Traytours against their <hi>Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne,</hi> to make them <hi>confident</hi> and <hi>secure</hi> therein, that so they may bee taken in the pit, which they haue digged for others.</p>
            <p>The first whereof, respecteth the manner of their plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and it is here set out vnto vs to be two-fold.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:9124:6"/>
First, (saith the spirit) <hi>They encourage themselues in a wicked purpose, they commune together,</hi> wherein the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the holy Ghost is, to lead vs to a policie verie vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in great and desperate attempts, that they are vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken <note place="margin">1. Leagues and Confederacies.</note> and prosecuted by combination of all sorts of strength, as so many helps to further the accomplishment thereof.</p>
            <p>Secondly, whereas close carriage &amp; conueyance is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speciall helpe to further dangerous designes, therefore the holy Ghost addeth, that the speciall matter of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell was, how they <hi>might lay snares priuily,</hi> signifying there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that they did not onely encourage themselues by mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall <note place="margin">2. Secrecie.</note> aduise, laying of their heads and purses together, but that a speciall part of their aduise was this, so to carie their Treasons, that none might see them: hoping by this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of plotting, to haue speedie, and suddaine execution, and discouering therein the ground and moouing cause of all these desperate practises, namely, they say in their hearts, <hi>who shall see them,</hi> that is, they say in effect, <hi>there is no God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, because malice is insatiable, and yet iealous too, doubtfull to be discried, and yet desirous to preuaile; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore behold, a second policie in these traiterous practises, both to delude secrecie, and more effectually to preuaile, <hi>they haue sought out iniquities</hi> (saith the blessed spirit) that is, they haue deuised store of snares, to entrap the life of the <hi>King,</hi> that so if one should faile, the other might take <note place="margin">3. Varietie of Plots.</note> effect, if some be discouered, and so breed securitie, (as v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually they doe) the other, that lye hid might come more suddenly, and surprise more fearefully, without auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
            <p>The snares being thus co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>triued in such <hi>secrecie</hi> &amp; <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">4. Confidence and presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of good successe.</note> that if the <hi>secrecie</hi> should faile in some, yet the rest might afterward preuaile. Here vppon doth vsually fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a double effect. The one in the wicked, whose pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty is, not onely to set a good face vppon a bad matter, but further also, in regard of such exquisite cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning, which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:9124:7"/>
they haue vsed therin to grow secure, and confident in the executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their intended attempts, vndoubtedly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading them selues of such successe therein, as that they shall haue their full desire against the serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of god. This doth the holy Ghost further expresse vnto vs, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he saith <hi>that they haue accomplished that, which they sought for, euen euery one in his secret thought, and in the depth of his hart,</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying vnto vs thereby, thus much; that what plots were layed by the wicked against the life of the King, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triued with such <hi>secrecie,</hi> and managed with such <hi>skill</hi> &amp; <hi>variety,</hi> as that the Contriuers thereof, made full account that they should preuaile, though not in the profession of their mouths, lest they should be descried, yet in the <hi>depth and secret of their hart,</hi> wherein they flattered themselues.</p>
            <p>And herevppon followeth another effect in the Saints <note place="margin">The godly on the contrarie, feare the worst.</note> of God, who being wise to see the plague which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming vppon them, notwithstanding the secret and cunning conueyance thereof, finding their sinne iustly to haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued no lesse, and the malice of the wicked ready to inflict vppon them much more, doe herevpon grow to a distrust in them selues, that surely so far as they see, there is no meanes to escape; and so in respect of their sinnes, submit them selues vnder the mightie hand of God, and manie times in their infirmity, do not sticke to complaine that they shall certainely be ensnared with the practises of the wicked. And so also the words may be referred as being spoken in the persons of Gods children assaulted with these troubles.</p>
            <p>Wherein we may behould the admirable wisdome of the lord, who hauing certainly determined to free his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants <note place="margin">These contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry effects make away to the manifestation of Gods mercy and iustice.</note> from the rage of the wicked, in disappoynting their practices, &amp; turning them vppon their owne pates: doth by these two effects, of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence of the wicked, and despaire of Gods seruants in them selues, prepare a notable way therevnto: For, concerning the distrust of Gods children in themselues, seeing no meanes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> flesh to auoid the danger, as this must needes cause them to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:9124:7"/>
renounce all confidence in the flesh, so doth it more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently cast them vpon God, and prouoke them more earnestly to call for his assistance, the more they see them selues stripped of all helpe from man: Wherby it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to passe, that <hi>calling vpon the Lord in the day of trouble</hi> in this full affiance of helpe in him alone, <hi>they are deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by him,</hi> that <hi>so they may glorifie him,</hi> As for that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie <note place="margin">Psa. 50. 15.</note> of the wicked, grounded vppon the <hi>secrecie</hi> and <hi>multitude</hi> of their mischiefes, what is this else but a mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger of their distruction? and the more confident they are in the successe of their proiects, the nearer is their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to the confusion &amp; subuersion of them; yea herein will the Lord reiect their confidence, that a <hi>suddaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Thes. 5. 3.</note> 
               <hi>shall come vpon them,</hi> and <hi>they shall not be able to auoyd it.</hi> For so it felloweth in the next words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But God shall shoot an arrow at them suddenly &amp;c.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <note place="margin">VVhich is most wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall policies of the wicked.</note> marke I pray you the wonderfull power and wisdome of God, in meeting with their seuerall policies, by his most iust and answerable Iudgements.</p>
            <p>For are the wicked wise, and deliberate in plotting their enterprises? are they long in weauing, &amp; warie in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triuing? behold, the Lord doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>found this their wisdom <note place="margin">1. Their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berat plotting is confounded by sudden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feature.</note> by coming vpon them <hi>suddenly,</hi> that they which had such store of wisdome to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>triue mischeife against others, shall now be to seeke of any wisedome for the auoiding of such sudden arrowes of Gods vengeance as shall come vpon them. Behold here their wisedome turned into folly.</p>
            <p>Againe, are the wicked subtill in deuising many stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems? <note place="margin">2. Their mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold snares with one ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible blow.</note> behold, the lord will with one blow cut them <hi>of at once. Affliction shall not rise vppon them the second time;</hi> who had hoped many times to haue ensnared the Saints of God: Behold here the multitude of their wicked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracies confounded with one stroake of Gods righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous vengeance.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, were they so secret in the contriuing of their mischiefes, that they gaue it out confidently that <hi>none shall see:</hi> behold the spirit of God giues them the lie, and tels
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:9124:8"/>
them playnely, that <hi>All men shall see it,</hi> yea, they who had thought so cunningly to haue caried their wickednes, as to haue gone clearely away with it, the spirit tells them they shalbe discouered, and to confound them the more, in this discouery, he tells them plainely, that <hi>their owne tongues shall fall vppon them.</hi> They that say, <hi>their tongues</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psa. 12. 4.</note> 
               <hi>are their owne, who is Lord ouer them?</hi> shall now see, that the mighty God ouer-rules their tongues, and makes them the instruments of his glory, in the discouery of sinne, and the executioners of his vengeance, in the punishment of the sinner. Behold their secrecie, euen confounded from their owne mouthes.</p>
            <p>Lastly, do the wicked strengthen themselues in their mischeifes by confederacies and leagues? Loe, the Lord <note place="margin">4. Their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacies scattered.</note> will scatter their companies when he comes to Iudgment against them, so that <hi>whosoeuer doth see them shall flye away:</hi> Behold here the disvniting and breaking of their confederacies.</p>
            <p>The practices of the wicked thus wonderfully defeated, <note place="margin">Here follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the vse that is made thereof. 1. Generall, All men shall see it.</note> and they being iustly met with all in their mischeifes, by answerable iudgments, what now is to be done by those that are deliuered? what must we repay vnto the Lord for all his wonderfull mercyes?</p>
            <p>The holy Ghost proceedeth in the two next verses to informe vs in such duties as concerne vs in this case, <hi>All men shall see it</hi> (saith the blessed spirit) that is, the eyes of all men shalbe fastened vpon it, to obserue and behold the wonderfull workes of God. And whosoeuer shall duely obserue these great workes of God, and shall giue him the reuerence that is due vnto his name, for the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of so great iudgments, his mouth shalbe <hi>opened to</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2. Shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it.</note> 
               <hi>declare the worke of God,</hi> he cannot be silent in a day of so good tydings, nay, he shall not onely speake of what is done, but his vnderstanding shalbe convinced, that it was not the arme of flesh but the Lords owne doing, nay, he <note place="margin">3. Vnderstand it to be Gods doing.</note> shall further <hi>vnderstand</hi> the greatnesse of the deliuerance, he shall <hi>vnderstand</hi> (sayth the holy Ghost) <hi>what God hath
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:9124:8"/>
done.</hi> And this vse shall euerie one make of great deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances. But the righteous, who onely hath true inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest <note place="margin">2. Particular to the saints.</note> therein, when he hath apprehended in his iudgement the greatnesse of this mercie; when hee hath attained in some measure to a large knowledge thereof; then shall his heart bee enlarged to <hi>reioyce-therein,</hi> and finding it to <note place="margin">1. To reioyce.</note> be the <hi>Lords doing,</hi> which <hi>is maruailous in his eyes,</hi> this shall bee a meanes to make him <hi>trust in God,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <note place="margin">2. To trust in God.</note> finding his <hi>heart vpright</hi> vnto the Lord his God, hee shall <hi>againe reioyce</hi> in the greatnesse of his mercie. Thus shall the righteous doe, whose hearts are vpright in the Lord. Thus shall a great deliuerance bee entertained by them.</p>
            <p>Now, that wee may approoue our selues to bee of the number of these, hauing thus briefly deliuered the sum of the Scripture, let vs turne backe againe, and consider the seuerall lessons therein contained, that so we may lay them vnto our hearts, as they lye in order, and make fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther applicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them, to our building vp in Christ Iesus.</p>
            <p>And first, let vs consider the policies, whereby Rebels and desperat persons so animate themselues in their trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous practises, that they are fearelesse, and exceeding presumptuous in the deuising, and prosecuting thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They encourage them selues &amp;c.</hi> (saith the holy Ghost) <note place="margin">1. Obseruation The wicked strengthen and encourage the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in their wickednesse, and why?</note> in a wicked purpose: That is, they vse all outward and carnall meanes to strengthen, and confirme them selues therein, that so they may not be daunted, &amp; driuen from their purposes. A policie very vsuall among the wicked in plotting of desperate attempts, and indeede uery ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to the effecting thereof. For where the conscience of so great euill must needs disharten them, there all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward encouragements will proue litle ynough. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in doth appeare the wisedome of the world, that what is wanting in the inward approbation, shall outwardly be supplied by carnall comforts. But aboue all the cunning of Satan, is heere most liuely discouered, who, purposing to bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to confusion by these desperate practises, doth
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:9124:9"/>
therefore oppose these outward encouragements, to the inward checkes and discouragements of the conscience, that so the checks of the conscience might in some sort be counteruailed, and therby neglected: and the <hi>hart</hi> being by this meanes <hi>hardned,</hi> and so in the end made <hi>past fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">4. Ephes. 19.</note> the wicked may break out more desperately in their attempts, as being now possessed with a deadly securitie, whereby, hauing made vp the measure of their sin, <hi>when they shall say peace, and securitie, and feare no euill, then shall</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Thess. 5. 3.</note> 
               <hi>a suddaine destruction come vpon them, and they shall not be able to auoide it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Loe, heare the wisedome of the wicked in this encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of themselues; and yet behold a further depth of their wisedome in the <hi>meanes,</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of this encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, and yet all tending to their further confusion.</p>
            <p>These <hi>meanes</hi> I haue obserued to be of two sorts; The first are <hi>carnall,</hi> seruing onely to satisfie the <hi>flesh;</hi> but the <note place="margin">Two sorts of meanes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the wicked doe encourage themselues.</note> second are <hi>spirituall,</hi> pretended to satisfie the <hi>minde</hi> in these lawlesse and monstrous actions, and so to giue co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of <hi>iustifying</hi> the same.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Carnall</hi> furtherances, to these desperate attempts <note place="margin">Carnall, and they are two.</note> are of diuers sorts. <hi>First, a combining and vniting of forces together,</hi> by <hi>leagues,</hi> and <hi>associations;</hi> and that for diuers ends. <hi>First,</hi> to giue <hi>credite</hi> vnto their attempts in regard <note place="margin">Leagues and Confederacies.</note> of the multitude; secondly, to breed <hi>terrour</hi> of their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, as proceeding fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so many; &amp; lastly, that what can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be don secretly, may by <hi>force openly</hi> be maintained. So did <hi>the nations of the earth, band the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues against the Lord, and against his Annointed.</hi> So did <hi>the Tabernacles of Edom</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psa. 2. 2.</note> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>spire with the <hi>Israelites, Moab with the Ammonites, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal, Amelech, the Philistines,</hi> and the rest, when they sayd: <hi>Come &amp; let vs cut them off fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being a nation, &amp; let the name</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psa. 83. 3.</note> 
               <hi>of Israel be no more in remembrance.</hi> So did the enemies of God, combine themselues in that <hi>vnholy League,</hi> euen in our age, for the rooting out of the poore Church of God. And so did that viperous brood, thus incourage it selfe by <hi>secret leagues</hi> and <hi>associations</hi> at home, and abroad, to rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,

and destroy vtterly the most excellent estate of the <hi>blood Royall,</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Common wealth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And shall the wicked be thus wise in their generation, to strengthen themselues in their mischiefes, against God, and his Church, by combining their forces together: and shall not wee which are the children of light, much more be knit together in the <hi>bond of peace,</hi> that wee may ioyntly bend our strength against the common enemie? shall the the shadowes separate vs, when the substance is endangered? It was a comfortable speech of <hi>Iudah</hi> vnto <note place="margin">So let vs strengthen our selues against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>Iudg.</hi> 1. 3</note>

            <p>Loe here, a second policie of the wicked in laying their snares, that which they doe, shalbe done secretly, that so it may clenly, and without danger be conuayed. And that wee may perceiue it is a matter of importance, the holy Ghost tels vs, that it is not don, without great aduise, <hi>They commune together</hi> in their best aduizements. Thus did the Iewes often consult together, against our Sauiour Christ, and the manner of their councell was, to surprise him pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uily, <note place="margin">As did the Iewes.</note> and to remooue him secretly, (as building on that false God, that if hee stood, their Kingdome must needs downe) because both they feared the people, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore durst not openly at the first set vpon him, and indeed standing vpon the credite of their seeming holinesse, they would if so they might, haue auoyded the open shame, as to bee counted the murtherers of so holy a man. And
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:9124:12"/>
so for the same cause those murtherers of Princes, howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer <note place="margin">And so doe our aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries carrie their mischiefs secretly.</note> it be a ruled case in the books of their diuelish policy, that all power, that spurnes at that vsurped Hierarchie, &amp; will not bowe to their triple Crowne, must necessarily bee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> remooued (as being conuinced in their conscience with that true ground, that the ordinance of God which is lawfull gouernement, will certainely ouerthrow their vsurped tyrannie:) yet neither will they be seen (if it may be,) in so horrible a practise, neither will any of their wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser Patrons openly iustifie the doing thereof, but vpon the vnhappie successe of the same. And the reasons are; <note place="margin">1. Least they which professe humilitie should openly be taxed with pride and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition. 2. Least they which professe holinesse, should be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly charged with such hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible impietie.</note> first, least that they which (in the greatest) professe so great humility, (as to be the seruant of seruants) should o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly discouer their vnsatiable ambition, that they will be exalted aboue all that is called God. And secondly, least they which professe so great holynesse, and teach such strictnesse of obedience vnto others, should apparantlie be conuinced of such monstrous impiety &amp; disobedience.</p>
            <p>And as their religion is nought else but a mistery of iniquity, cloaking sinne from the eye of the world; so in their seuerall policies for the managing of that Kingdom, and in those manifold weapons of their warfare, whereby they mantaine their Diadem, &amp; resist all opposite powers, we shall find that <hi>secrecie</hi> hath been an espetiall poynt, which herein they haue aymed at, that they might not be <note place="margin">That they delight in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecie, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in their weapons.</note> seen in these their stratagems. It was the policie of the Iewes that they might not be seen in the fact, or else devolue the hatred &amp; enuie vpon others, to execute their malice against our Sauiour Christ by others. So did they hyre <hi>Iudas to betray Christ vnto them:</hi> so brought they in <hi>Pylate to giue</hi> sentence vpon him. And surely such hath been the cunning of these Antichristian Locusts, if wee <note place="margin">In the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their inquisition.</note> shall obserue the manner of their bloody inquisition. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused we must be, and yet we shall not know by whome; tormented wee shall be, and yet not see by whome. Yf any be seen herein, it shalbe some of our owne house, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther some weake Protestant, that hath yeilded for feare

Thus as their practice hath been to lay their snares secretly, &amp; to accomplish their malice by the deputation of others: so that their posterity might haue a president of such practices, and haue continuall war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to the accomplishment of the like, behold their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelish subtilty in <hi>incorporating of their cruell lawes, into the lawes of such nations,</hi> among who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e they haue erected their <note place="margin">Their incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porating of their Canon law into the lawes of nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

That ordinarie meat should be subiect to this infection, that apparell and such like, should be infected therewith, this, as it is a matter suspitious, so is it prouided for, by tasting, ayring, perfuming, and such like: but who wold euer suspect such abhominable impietie in so prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall a part of their diuine worship? what charitable or religious heart, would once dreame of any snare couched in so holy misteries? their tasting is not vsed, because there is no suspition, there danger is not feared, where so great deuotion is pretended.

that wisdome <hi>shall not onely be iustified of her children,</hi> but euen of her enemies, our very aduersaries shall giue testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony vnto the goodnesse of our cause, oh what a terror is this vnto the wicked, that they shall thus desperately fight against the light of their owne consciences, that when they see that the Lord doth maintaine his owne cause, and when they haue beene compelled to acknowledge, that our cause is Gods, yet they shall continue their malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst so good a cause, yet they shall thus desperately fight against heauen, and prouoke the holy one of Israel to their iust confusion.

            <p>It was much that <hi>Saul</hi> should iustifie the innocencie of <hi>Dauid,</hi> wonderfull was the Lord herein, to wring from a reprobate, the approbation of his seruant, and very holy herein was the Iustice of God, in discouering this wilfull obstinacy of a cast-away, that so hee might prepare him thereby to his further condemnation.

and the searching thereof, doeth onely belong to God, therefore as we dare not vndertake herein any certen de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination concerning the hearts of others, yet because the Lord doth vouchsafe vs the assurance of our saluation in this life, the test mony whereof especially proceedeth from <hi>the spirit of God, witnessing vnto our spirits that we are his children:</hi> as by this we are sure of the soundnesse of our <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 19.</note> owne hearts, so do we not want many excellent markes of this inward sincerity.</p>
