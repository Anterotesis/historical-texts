            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This Gallimawfrey of Fragments was first publish'd in 1649. in favour of <hi>Cromwells</hi> Proceeding, and Government: the main Stress of the Discourse, resting upon these two Points. <hi>First,</hi> that <hi>the Late King was lawfully put to death. Secondly,</hi> that the <hi>English Monarchy</hi> is not <hi>Hereditary,</hi> but Elective: And so the Author, by Presidents, either Impertinent, Unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Perverted, or misapply'd, supports his Pretensions the best he can.</p>
            <p>Finding this Treasonous Piece to be now Re-printed, I could not but bethink my self <hi>To what end</hi>? And this Curiosity put me upon comparing the <hi>Two Editions,</hi> to see, how far they <hi>Agreed</hi>; wherein they <hi>Differ'd</hi>: or whether this <hi>Latter Impression</hi> were the very same with the <hi>Original.</hi> Upon the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, I find severall sly Variations, and Additions, and many things Omitted in the Latter Copy; which gives first to understand that this is not the work of a Bookseller, or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for profit; but a Regular, and Industrious Disposition of the matter for some other purpose: And what that Purpose is may be easily gather'd from the Pulse and Biass of the Treatise; For the <hi>Omissions,</hi> though <hi>Many,</hi> &amp; <hi>Large</hi> are only such as apply the Arguments for the Sovereign Power of a <hi>Parliament</hi> or the <hi>People,</hi> to the <hi>Defence</hi> of the <hi>Late Kings Murther</hi>; or else such as strike so directly at the <hi>Subversion</hi> of the <hi>Monarchy</hi>; that the Age is not as yet either so Mad, or so Wicked as to bear it: But his Arguments, and Reasonings all this while, for the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Right</hi> of Calling their <hi>Kings</hi> to an <hi>Account,</hi> remain <hi>Whole,</hi> and <hi>Vntouch'd</hi>; So that his <hi>Maintenance</hi> of the <hi>Peoples Power</hi> over the <hi>King,</hi> even to the <hi>Deposing</hi> and putting of him to <hi>Death,</hi> stands

as good against <hi>this King</hi> as it did against his <hi>Father</hi>; and speaks the <hi>Publisher</hi> and the <hi>Author</hi> to be both of a mind in the Case. In One word, the <hi>two Pos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <q>
               <p>I cannot see (<hi>says he</hi>) why it should be a Crime for any to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire that an Action of such Concernment (<hi>putting the King to death</hi>) might be fully Clear'd to be Just, and acted Justly. Page <hi>2. And again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would gladly have spoken all that I justly might, to have saved him from death, till I had seen that his Life could not consist with Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Peace and Safety, which I may acknowledge to be the Supreme, and Highest Law Humane, P. <hi>3. Further,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My work shall be to Enquire of matters of Law: And how by the Laws and Customs of this Kingdom, it may be known, Adjudged and Declar'd what is the Duty of our King, and whether he hath done it or not; and in case of failure, how it may be judg'd, who they be that must determine it, so that the Subject may and should be quiet, and submit to such an Act Judiciall and Conclusive. Pag. <hi>4. Once again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may seem a short work and soon sayd when the King breaks his Trust, the Parliament must Judge him, and when the Lords refuse, the Commons might and must, because it was <hi>Necessity</hi>; but I am loth to hide my self in a Dark <hi>Chaos,</hi> I had rather see it Cleared in the Open Sun. P. <hi>4.</hi>

            </q>
            <p>This is sufficient to shew the Opinion, and the Drift of the Author; wherein he declares himself, that the Late King was Justly put to death, and undertakes by Law and Reason to prove it; So that his Pretended Proofs being now Expos'd to the Publick, by <hi>Kidgell,</hi> and <hi>Baldwin,</hi> in the very same terms

            <p>[<hi>Let us Discusse it</hi> (says he) <hi>by Law and Reason, what is our Legall</hi> Fcalty; <hi>how made, how Limited, how kept, or how DIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SOLV'D.

[Allegeance <hi>was</hi> ad Legem <hi>to the</hi> Laws, <hi>the</hi> Kingdom, <hi>and the</hi> Kingdoms good, <hi>or</hi> Profit, <hi>together with the</hi> King. <hi>P.</hi> 18.] We'l see now what he says to the Point <hi>of Election</hi> or <hi>Succession.</hi> [<hi>In the time</hi> (says he) <hi>of</hi> Hen. 1. <hi>and</hi> Hen. 2. <hi>there were some Speciall Acts of Parliament for settling the Crown on</hi> Maud <hi>the Empress, or her Issue. P.</hi> 24. — <hi>But all such Acts (for Tying the Crown to such or such a Family) do not Evince a Former Right of Succession. P.</hi> 25.—And then further [<hi>I say not</hi> (says he Ibid.) <hi>how often it hath been adjudg'd that</hi> Affirmative <hi>Statutes do not annull the</hi> Common Law; <hi>and that one may</hi> Prescribe <hi>against a Statute</hi> Negative, <hi>but in</hi> Affirmance <hi>of the</hi> Common Law,—<hi>So that if an</hi> English King <hi>was Elective by the</hi> Common Law, <hi>the</hi> Kingdom <hi>might Prescribe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Late Statutes, which might Erre much more then they could Oblige All Future Parliaments, but they might still be free and most of all in what was due before by</hi> Common Law. Ibid.] And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over <hi>P.</hi> 75. <hi>He grounds his Pretence upon the Speech of</hi> Hubert <hi>at the Coronation of King</hi> John (an Excellent President for his turn) [<hi>It is well known to you all that no man hath Right of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession to this Crown, Except, that by Unanimous Consent of the Kingdom, with Invocation on the Holy Ghost, he be Elected from his own Deserts; but if any of the last Kings race be more worthy and better then others, his Election is more Proper, or more Reasonable, as it now is in Earl</hi> John <hi>here present.—Which</hi> (says he, Ibid.) <hi>seemeth most rightly to State the nature of</hi> Succession <hi>as it was in this Kingdom. So that all did amount but to this, That if a King had such Children; so Qualify'd, and so Educated, that they were above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in Virtue, Wisdom, and True worth</hi> (<hi>or at least</hi> Caeteris Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res) <hi>they were the most likely Candidates for the Crown.</hi>] So that his Malitious Imposture resolves at last wholly into this. He sets the Parliament and the People above the King; and makes the Government <hi>Elective,</hi> by the <hi>Common Law,</hi> and from thence

            <p>Having here laid before your Lordship both the <hi>Quality</hi> of the <hi>Crimes</hi> suggested, and the <hi>Names</hi> of several of the <hi>Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals</hi>; and all of them Persons too, within the reach of your <hi>Command:</hi> It is not so much <hi>L'Estrange,</hi> as the <hi>Common Voice</hi> of an <hi>Injur'd Government</hi> and <hi>People</hi> that makes this Application.</p>
            <p>But I am further to represent to your Lordship, that at the same time, while these Libellous Papers and Agents go Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>free, the Authors and Publishers of other Books and Papers,

whose Business is only to vindicate the Government from the Forgeries, Calumnies, Malice and Sedition of the Dayly Libels of <hi>Care, Curtis, Janeway, Baldwin,</hi> &amp;c. are <hi>Presented,</hi> and the <hi>Bills found</hi>; as Mrs <hi>Brome</hi> particularly, for the <hi>Observator,</hi> by a a c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rtain <hi>Grand Jury,</hi> who, according to their Oath, could neither <hi>see,</hi> nor <hi>hear</hi> of any thing on the other hand; while yet at the same time, almost every <hi>Stall</hi> is <hi>cover'd,</hi> and every <hi>Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee-House furnished</hi> with <hi>News-Papers</hi> and <hi>Pamphlets</hi> (both <hi>written</hi> and <hi>Printed</hi>) of <hi>Personal Scandal, Schism</hi> and <hi>Treason.</hi> But I shall now desire your Lordship and your Right Worshipful Brethren to take Notice what it is that the <hi>Animals</hi> of this Age call the <hi>Favouring of Popery,</hi> and the <hi>Creating of Misunderstanding betwixt His Majesty and People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Observator,</hi> Num. 27. (after some Remarks upon the <hi>Practices</hi> and <hi>Positions</hi> of a <hi>Phanatical Party</hi>) says to this purpose; [<hi>Never Mince the Matter; but instead of Demanding This or That, under a Disguise, speak plain, and put the Sence of the Party into the Form of a Petition</hi>:] And then follows the Petition at length, in these very Syllables.</p>
            <p>Your Majesties most Humble and Obedient Subjects, having suffered many Disappointments, by reason both of <hi>Short</hi> and of <hi>Long Parliaments</hi>; and the late Executing of the Law against <hi>Dissenters</hi>; the Pretences of <hi>Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> and <hi>Popery</hi> being grown stale, the <hi>Popish Plot</hi> drawn almost to the Dregs; and the Eyes of the People so far open, that they begin to see their <hi>Friends</hi> from their <hi>Enemies</hi>; to the Disheartning of All <hi>True Protestants,</hi> and the Encouraging of the Sons of the Church: We your Majesties <hi>Dissenting Subjects,</hi> being thereby brought unto so low a state, that without a Timely Relief, We the <hi>Godly People of the Land,</hi> must inevitably Perish.</p>
            <q>May it please your Majesty to Grant the Right of <hi>Calling</hi> and <hi>Dissolving Parliaments,</hi> Entring into <hi>Associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Leagues</hi> and <hi>Covenants</hi>; the Power of the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61456:8"/>
               <hi>Militia, War</hi> and <hi>Peace, Life</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Enacting, Suspending</hi> and <hi>Repealing Laws,</hi> to be in your Liege People the <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> And these Things being Granted, (whereof your Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners stand in great need) if your Majesty wants ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Men</hi> or <hi>Monies,</hi> for the Support of Your Royal <hi>Dignity</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> your Majesty shall see what we your Loyal Petitioners will do for you.</q>
            <p>The <hi>Observator</hi> above-mention'd, concludes in these Words; [<hi>All the Rest is</hi> Cant <hi>and</hi> Gibberish; <hi>but This is</hi> English.] This <hi>Personated Petition</hi> is no more, in fine, than a <hi>Compendium</hi> of their <hi>Demands</hi> and <hi>Cemplaints,</hi> dress'd up in their own Hypocritical Terms: So that the <hi>Sedition</hi> lies in the <hi>Defending</hi> of the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Crown</hi> and <hi>Dignity,</hi> and the <hi>Laws of the Land</hi>; which necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly implies an <hi>Allowance</hi> and <hi>Justification</hi> of the <hi>Libellous Opposers</hi> of the <hi>Government.</hi>
