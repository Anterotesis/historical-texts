         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

THE
Commons of England Assembled in

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Need not give any other account of
my Publishing this ensuing short
discourse, then that which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the ground and reason of its
preaching, namely <hi>your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</hi>
Those who are not satisfied therewith, I
shall not endeavour to tender further grounds of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
unto, as not having any perswasion of
prevailing if I should attempt it. Prejudice so
far oftentimes prevails even on good <hi>soyls,</hi> that
satisfaction will not speedily thrive and grow in
them. That which exempts me from <hi>solicitousness</hi>
about the frame and temper of mens minds and
spirits in the entertainment of discourses of this
<pb facs="tcp:104602:3"/>
nature, is the annexing of that injunction unto our
commission in delivering the word of God: it
must be done <hi>whether men will hear or whether
they will forbear.</hi> Without therefore any plea
or Apologie, forwhat ever may seem most to need
it in this <hi>Sermon,</hi> I devolve the whole account of
the rise and issue it had, or may have on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of God in my call, and your command.
Onely I shall crave leave to adde that in my wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for a little leasure to recollect what had I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered;
out of my own short notes and others (that
I might not preach one Sermon and print another)
there were some considerations that fell in exciting
me to the obedience I had purposed. The desire I had
to make more publick at this time and season the
Testimony given in simplicity of spirit to the <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest</hi>
of Christ in these nations, and therein to the true
real interest of these Nations themselves, which was
my naked designe openly managed and persued with
all plainnesse of speech as the small portion of time
alotted to this exercise would allow) was the
chief of them. Solicitations of some particular
friends, gave also warmth unto that consideration.
I must further confesse that I was a little moved by
some <hi>mistakes</hi> that were delivered into the hands
of <hi>report,</hi> to be mannaged to the discountenance of
<pb facs="tcp:104602:3"/>
the honest and plain truth contended for, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when I found them without due considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
exposed in Print unto publick view. That is
the manner of these dayes wherein we live. I know
full well, that there is not any thing from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
to the ending of this short discourse that
doth really <hi>interfer</hi> with any form of civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
in the world, administred according to
righteousnesse and equity: as ther is not in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
of Christ or in any of the concernments of it. And
I am assured also that the truth proposed in it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraps
the whole ground of any just expectation
of the coutinuance of the presence of God amongst
us, and his acceptation of our endeavours about
the alotment and just disposal of our civil affaires,
let other lay what waight they will or please, upon
the lesser differences that are amongst us on any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
what ever; if this shield be safe, this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
maintained and established, that is here laid
down, and the just Rights of the Nation laid in a
way of administration suited unto its preservation
and furtherance I, shall not easily be cast down
from my hopes, that amongst us poor unprofitable
unthankful, creatures as we are, we may yet see
<hi>the fruit of Righteousnesse to be peace, and
the effect of Righteousnesse quietnesse and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance

cast their eye on this paper, I would begg of them
to lay aside all those <hi>prejudices</hi> against persons or
things which their various contexture in our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
affaires may possibly have raised in them. I
know how vain, for the most part expectations of
prevailing in such a desire, by naked requests, are
But sick men must be groaning though they look for
no relief thereby. Wherefore commiting it into that

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He design of this Chapter is to give in relief
against <hi>outward</hi> perplexing extremities from
<hi>Gospel</hi> promises, and the <hi>presence</hi> of Christ
with his people in those extremities.</p>
            <p>The next intendment of the words in the
<hi>Type,</hi> seems to relate to the deliverance of the People of
the <hi>Jews</hi> from the <hi>Babilonish</hi> captivity, and the presence
of God amongst them upon their return; God frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taking occasion from <hi>thence,</hi> to mind them of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi>
of Grace, with the full ratification and publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it by Christ, as is evident from <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. and 32. and
sundry other places.</p>
            <p>As to our purpose, we have considerable in the <hi>Chapter,</hi>
the <hi>Persons</hi> to whom these promises are given; the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi>
wherein they were; and the <hi>promises</hi> themselves,
that are made to them for their supportment and conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
            <p>The persons <hi>intended</hi> are the Remnant, the <hi>Escaping,</hi>
the <hi>evasion</hi> of <hi>Israel;</hi> as the word signifies, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. they
that are <hi>left, that remain, ver.</hi> 3. who escape the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation
that was to come on the body of the People, the
furnace they were to pass through. Only in the close of
that <hi>verse,</hi> they have a farther description added of them,
from the purpose of God concerning their <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:104602:5"/>
they are <hi>written among the living,</hi> or rather <hi>written un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
life;</hi> every one that is <hi>written,</hi> that is <hi>designed unto life
in Jerusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the persons in themselves considered, the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is easie unto this <hi>Assembly:</hi> Are you not the <hi>rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
the escaping of <hi>England?</hi> Is not this a <hi>brand plucked
out of the fire?</hi> Are you not they that are <hi>left,</hi> they that <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,</hi>
from great trials and desolations; the Lord grant
that the <hi>application</hi> may hold out, and abide to the end of
the Prophesie.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>condition</hi> that this <hi>remnant</hi> or escaping had been
in is laid down in some <hi>figurative</hi> expressions concerning
the <hi>smalness</hi> of this remnant, or the <hi>paucity</hi> of them that
should escape, and the greatness of the extremities they
should be exercised withal. I cannot insist on particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars;
it may suffice that great distresses and calamities
are intimated therein; and such have the days of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
trials and troubles been to some of us.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Promises</hi> here made to this People, thus esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
from great distresses are of two sorts. 1. <hi>Original</hi> or
fundamental, and then <hi>consequential</hi> thereon.</p>
            <p>1. There is the great spring or <hi>fountain promise,</hi> from
which all others as lesser <hi>streams</hi> do flow; and that is the
promise of <hi>Christ</hi> himself unto them, and amongst them;
<hi>ver.</hi> 2. He is that <hi>branch</hi> of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and that fruit of the
earth, <hi>which is there promised.</hi> He is the bottome and
foundation, the spring and fountain of all the good that is
or shall be communicated unto us, all other promises are
but <hi>rivulets</hi> from that unsearchable <hi>ocean</hi> of Grace and love,
that is in the promise of Christ; of which afterwards.</p>
            <p>2. The promises that are derived and flow from hence
may be referred unto three heads. <hi>I.</hi> Of <hi>beauty and glory,
ver.</hi> 2. 2. Of <hi>holiness and purity, ver.</hi> 3, 4. 3. Of <hi>preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
and <hi>safety, ver.</hi> 5, 6.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:104602:5"/>
My <hi>Text</hi> lies among the <hi>last</hi> sort, and not intending
long to detain you, I shall passe over the <hi>other,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
close with that of our present concernment.</p>
            <p>Now this promise of <hi>v.</hi> 5. is of a comprehensive nature,
and relates to <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>temporal</hi> safety or preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
Godlinesse though it be not much believed, yet
indeed hath the promises of this life, and that which is
to come.</p>
            <p>I shall a little open the <hi>words</hi> of the verse, &amp; thereby give
<hi>light</hi> to those which I have chosen peculiarly to insist upon
It is, as I have said <hi>safety</hi> and preservation both <hi>spiritual</hi>
and <hi>temporal</hi> that is here ingaged for; and concerning it
we have considerable;</p>
            <p>1. <hi>The manner of its production;</hi> I will <hi>create</hi> it saith
God. There is a creating power, needful to be exerted,
for the preservation of <hi>Sions</hi> remnant. Their preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
must be of Gods creation. It is, not onely, not to be
educed out of any other <hi>principle</hi> or to be wrought by any
other <hi>means;</hi> but it must, as it were by the Almighty pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of God, be brought out of <hi>nothing;</hi> God must create
it. At least, as there were two sorts of Gods creatures at
the beginning, that <hi>dark body</hi> of matter, whose rise was
meerly from nothing; and those things which from that
dark confused heap, he made to be <hi>other things,</hi> then what
they were therein; it is of the last sort of <hi>creatures</hi> if not
of the first. If the preservation of this <hi>Remnant</hi> be not
out of <hi>nothing,</hi> without any means at all; yet it is for the
most part from that darknesse and confusion of things,
which contributes very little or nothing towards it; I will
<hi>create</hi> it sath God; and whilst he continues possessed of
his <hi>creating power,</hi> it shall be well with his <hi>Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. For the <hi>nature</hi> of it, it is here set out, under the
termes of that <hi>eminent</hi> pledge of the presence of God
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104602:6"/>
with the people in the Wildernesse, for their guidance
and protection, in the mid'st of all their difficulties and
hazards, <hi>by a pillar of cloud,</hi> and a flaming fire; this guided
them thorow the Sea, and continued with them after the
setting up of the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> in the Wildernesse 40. years.
The use, and efficacy of that <hi>pillar,</hi> the intendment of God
in it, the Advantage of the people by it, I cannot stay to
unsold. It may suffice in general that it was a great and
signal pledge of Gods presence with them for their gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
and preservation; that they might act according
to his will, and enjoy safty in so doing. Onely whereas
this promise here respects <hi>Gospel times,</hi> the nature of the
mercy promised is enlarged, and thereby somewhat
changed. In the wildernesse there was but <hi>one Tabernacle;</hi>
and so consequently <hi>one cloude</hi> by day, and <hi>one pillar</hi> of
fire by night was a sufficient pledge of the presence of
God with the whole people: there are now <hi>many dwelling
places,</hi> many <hi>Assemblies</hi> of mount <hi>Sion;</hi> and in the enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of mercy and grace under the Gospel, the same
pledge of Gods presence and favour is promised to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of them as was before to the whole. The word we
have translated <hi>a dwelling place,</hi> denotes not a <hi>common ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation,</hi>
but a <hi>place prepared</hi> for God; and is the same with
the Assemblies and Congregations in the expression fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.
The sum of all is; God by his creating power,
in despite of all opposition will bring forth preservation
for his people, guiding them in paths wherein they shall
finde peace and safty.</p>
            <p>Onely ye may observe the <hi>order</hi> and dependance of
these promises; the promise of <hi>holinesse v.</hi> 4. lies in order,
before that of <hi>safety v.</hi> 5. Unlesse our <hi>filth</hi> and our <hi>blood</hi>
be purged away, by <hi>a spirit of judgement, and a spirit of burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi>
its in vain for us, to look for the <hi>pillar</hi> and the <hi>cloud.</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:104602:6"/>
If we are not interested in <hi>holinesse,</hi> we shall not be inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested
in <hi>safety;</hi> I mean as it lies in the promise, and is a
mercy washed in the blood of <hi>Jesus;</hi> for as for the peace
of the world, I regard it not. Let not men of <hi>polluted
hearts,</hi> and <hi>defiled hands,</hi> once imagine, that God cares
for them in an especial manner. If our <hi>filth</hi> and our <hi>blood,</hi>
our sin and our corruption abide upon us, and we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered,
it will be for a greater ruine; the way unto
the <hi>cloud</hi> and <hi>pillar,</hi> is by the spirit of judgement and
burning.</p>
            <p>The words of my Text are a recapitulation of the whole
<hi>verse;</hi> and are a <hi>Gospel promise</hi> given out in Law termes,
or a <hi>New Testament mercy,</hi> under Old Testament ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions.</p>
            <p>I shall then briefly shew you these tow things; 1. What
is here expressed as to the <hi>Type</hi> and <hi>Figure.</hi> 2. What
is here intended as to the <hi>Substance</hi> of the mercy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised.</p>
            <p>1. For the <hi>Figure;</hi> by the <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>defence, a double con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort,</hi>
or two <hi>paires</hi> of things seem to be intended; 1. The
<hi>Ark</hi> and the <hi>Mercyseat.</hi> 2. The <hi>Tabernacle</hi> and the <hi>pillar
of fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the <hi>first;</hi> the <hi>Ark</hi> is oftentimes called the <hi>Glory of
God;</hi> Psal. 78. 61. <hi>He gave his strength into Captivity, and his
Glory into the hand of his enemies.</hi> Where he spakes of the
surprisal of the <hi>Ark</hi> by the <hi>Philistines;</hi> which when it was
accomplished, <hi>Phineas</hi> his wife called her son <hi>Ichabod,</hi> and
said the <hi>Glory is departed.</hi> 1 Sam. 4. 21.</p>
            <p>2. The word which we have rendered a <hi>defence</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
signifies a <hi>covering;</hi> as was the mercy seat, the <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
of the Ark.</hi> So that <hi>upon the Glory shall be a defence,</hi> is as
much as unto you, the <hi>mercy seat shall be on the Ark,</hi> or you
shall have the mercy represented and intimated thereby<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:104602:7"/>
2. The <hi>Tabernacle</hi> and <hi>cloud,</hi> or <hi>pillar</hi> of <hi>fire,</hi> are also
called to mind; so the words are expressive, of that fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of Gods gracious presence with his people, which
we have recounted, <hi>Exod. 40. 34. Then a cloud covered the
tent of the congregation, and the Glory of the Lord filled the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle.</hi>
So it continued, the <hi>Glory of God</hi> was in the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle,
and the <hi>cloud</hi> upon it, or <hi>over it;</hi> as the word
here is; and so <hi>upon all the glory there was a defence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I need not stay to prove that all those things were <hi>typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
of Christ; he was the end of the law, represented by
the <hi>Ark,</hi> which did contain it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3, 4. he was the
<hi>mercyseat;</hi> as he is called and said to be, <hi>Rom. 3. 25. 1 Joh.</hi>
2. 2. Covering the law from the eye of justice, as to those
that are interested in him; he was the <hi>tabernacle</hi> and <hi>temple</hi>
wherein dwelt the <hi>Glory</hi> of God, and which was recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced
with all <hi>pledges</hi> of his gracious presence.</p>
            <p>Apply then this promise to Gospel times, and the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of it is comprehended in these two propositions.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>The presence of Christ with any people, is the Glory of any
people.</hi> This is the glory here spoken of, as is evident to
any one that will but <hi>read</hi> over the second verse, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
its <hi>influence</hi> into these words. <hi>The branch of the Lord
shall be to them beautiful and glorious, and upon all the glory
shall be a defence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>The presence of God in special providence over a people,
attends the presence of Christ in grace with a people;</hi> if Christ
the glory be with them, a defence shall be upon them;
what lies else in <hi>allusion</hi> to the <hi>mercy-seat,</hi> not drawn forth
in these propositions, may be afterwards insisted on.</p>
            <p>For the first; what I pray else should be so. This is
their <hi>Glory</hi> or they have none; is it in their <hi>number,</hi> that
they are great, many, and populous? God thinks not so,
nor did he when he gave an account of his thoughts of his
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:104602:7"/>
People of old, <hi>Deut. 7. 7. The Lord did not set his love upon
you nor chose you, because you were more in number then any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
for you were the fewest of all people.</hi> God made no reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning
of <hi>numbers;</hi> he chose that People that was fewest
of all. He esteemed well of them, when they were <hi>but
a few men in number, yea very few and strangers;</hi> Psal. 105.
12. You know what it cost <hi>David</hi> in being seduced by
<hi>Sathan</hi> into the contrary opinion. He thought the glory
of his People had been in their <hi>number,</hi> and caused them
to be reckoned; but God taught him his error, by taking
off with a dreadful judgement no small portion of the
<hi>number</hi> he sought after. There is nothing more common
in the <hi>Scripture</hi> then for the Lord to speak <hi>contempt</hi> of the
<hi>multitude</hi> of any people, as a thing of nought; and he takes
pleasure to confound them by weak and despised means.
Is it in their wisdome and counsel, their understanding for
the ordering of their affairs? Is that their <hi>glory?</hi> Why,
see how God derides the <hi>Prince of Tyrus,</hi> who was lifted
up with an apprehension hereof; and counted himself as
God, upon that account; <hi>Ezek. 27. 3, 4, 5. 6. &amp;c.</hi> The
issue of all is; <hi>Thou shalt be a man and no God in the hand of
him that slays thee;</hi> God will let him see in his ruin and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
what a vain thing that was, which he thought
his glory. Might I dwell upon it I could evince unto you
these two things.</p>
            <p>1. That whereas the end of all <hi>humane wisdom,</hi> in nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or the Rulers of them is, to preserve humane society
in peace and quietness, within the several bounds and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotments
that are given unto them by the providence of
God, it so comes to pass for the most part through the
righteous judgment and <hi>wise disposal</hi> of God, that it hath
a contrary end, and bringeth forth <hi>contrary effects</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the world. Do not the inhabitants of the earth, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104602:8"/>
owe all their <hi>disturbance,</hi> sorrow, and blood to the
wise contrivances of a few men, not knowing how to take
the Law of their proceedings from the mouth of God,
but laying their deep counsels and politick contrivances
in a subserviency to their lusts and ambition. And what
<hi>Glory</hi> is there in that which almost constantly brings forth
contray effects to its own proper end and intendment?</p>
            <p>2. That God delights to mix a <hi>spirit of giddinesse,</hi> error,
and folly in the counsels of the <hi>wise men</hi> of the world;
making them reel and stagger in their way like a drunken
man, that they shall not know what to do, but common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in their greatest concernments, fix upon things, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
of true reason and sound wisdom, as any children
or fools could close withal. <hi>He taketh the wise in their own
craftinesse, and the Counsel of the froward is carried headlong;</hi>
Job 5. 13. 14. so at large Isa. 19. 11. 12, 13, 14. and now
where is their glory? I could give instances of both these,
and that plentifully in the dayes and seasons that have pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
over our own heads.</p>
            <p>The like also may be said of the strength, the power,
the armies of any people; if their number and wisdom
be vain, be <hi>no Glory,</hi> their strength which is but the result
or exurgency of their number and wisdom, must needs
be so also. But you have all this summed up together.
Jer. 9. 23. 24. <hi>Thus saith the Lord, Let not the wise man glory
in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let
no<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the rich man glory in his riches; but let him that glorieth,
glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am
the Lord:</hi> It is neither <hi>Wisdom</hi> nor <hi>might</hi> nor <hi>riches,</hi> that
is our <hi>Glory;</hi> but our interest in <hi>Jehovah</hi> onely.</p>
            <p>This I say is in the presence of Christ only: Now
Christ may be said to be <hi>present</hi> with a people two
wayes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:104602:8"/>
1. In respect of the dispensation of his Gospel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, the profession of it, and subjection to the
Ordinances thereof. The Gospel of Christ is <hi>a blessed Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi>
a <hi>glorious Gospel,</hi> in its self, and unto them that embrace
it. But yet this profession seperated from the <hi>Root</hi> from
which it ought to spring, is not the Glory of any people;
<hi>Christ is not their glory who are his shame.</hi> Empty profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is the shame of Christ in the world; and shall not
be others glory. The Apostle tells us that this may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
with a litter of unclean lusts, making them in whom it
is abominable to God and man. 2 Tim. 3, 4. &amp;c. If the
bare <hi>profession</hi> of the truth, would render a nation <hi>Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi>
Oh how <hi>glorious</hi> were this nation. So would have
been the people of old, who cryed the <hi>temple of the Lord,
the Temple of the Lord.</hi> But when men professe the truth of
Christ, but in their hearts and wayes maintain and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
an enmity to the power of that truth, and to all of
Christ that is in reality in the world, this is no <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Christ is present with a people in and by his <hi>spirit,</hi>
dwelling in their hearts by his <hi>spirit</hi> and faith, uniting
them to himself: I do not distinguish this from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
as inconsistent with it; for though the <hi>former</hi> may
be without this, yet where <hi>this is,</hi> there will be the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
also. <hi>Profession</hi> may be without <hi>union,</hi> but <hi>union</hi> will
bring forth <hi>profession.</hi> There may be a form of Godliness
without power: but where the power is, there will be the
appearance also. Now when Christ is thus present with
a people, that is, they are united to him by his spirit, they
are members of his <hi>mystical</hi> body, that is, their <hi>glory.</hi> Be
they <hi>few</hi> or <hi>many</hi> in a <hi>nation</hi> that are so, they are the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of that nation, and nothing else: and where there is
the most of them, there is the most <hi>glory:</hi> and where
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:104602:9"/>
they are diminished, there the <hi>glory</hi> is eclipsed. Christ
<hi>mystical,</hi> the Head, and his body is all the <hi>glory</hi> that is in
the world. If any nation be <hi>glorious</hi> and honourable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
others, it is because of this presence of Christ in that
nation. Christ is the <hi>glory</hi> of his Saints. Isa. 4. 2. In him
they <hi>glory:</hi> Isa. 45. 25. And the <hi>Saints are Christs glory,</hi> 2 Cor.
8. 23. They are the glory of Christ: and he glories in
them, as God of <hi>Job,</hi> to <hi>Sathan, Seest thou my servant Job,</hi>
Chap. 1. 8. He doth as it were glory in him against the
wickednesse of the world; and Christ in them, and they in
him, are all the glory of this world.</p>
            <p>So Zech. 2. 8. Christ was in the pursuit of the collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his people from their dispersion: what seeks he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
what looks he for? he <hi>goes after the glory.</hi> Even to
finde out them who are <hi>Gods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> glory</hi> in the world.</p>
            <p>Now this is the <hi>Glory of any people</hi> upon a three fold
account.</p>
            <p>1 This alone makes them <hi>honourable</hi> and <hi>precious</hi> before
God. So says God of them Isa. 43. 1. <hi>I have redeemed thee,
I have called thee by thy name, thou are mine;</hi> those are they
of whom I spake: what then, <hi>v. 4. thou art precious
in my sight, thou art honourable, I have loved thee;</hi> how
doth God manifest his valuation of them <hi>v.</hi> 3. Why he
will give all the world, the greatest, mightiest,
wealthiest nations for them. <hi>v.</hi> 5. all is as nothing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of them, who are his portion and the lot of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance.
The Lord keep this alive upon your hearts,
that, that may be in your eyes the <hi>glory</hi> of this nation, on
the account whereof, it is <hi>precious</hi> to God, and <hi>honourable</hi>
in his sight.</p>
            <p>2. Because this <hi>presence</hi> of Christ makes men <hi>comely</hi> and
<hi>excellent</hi> in themselves, with what eye soever the world
may look upon them. The whole world out of Christ
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:104602:9"/>
lies in evil, under the curse of God, and defilement of sin:
in all the glitering shews of their wealth and riches, in the
state and magnificence of their governments, the beauty
of their laws and order, (as they relate to their persons)
they are in the eye of God a <hi>filthy</hi> and an abominable
thing, a thing that his soul loatheth. Curse and sin will
make any thing to be so: but now Christ is to them and
in them beautiful and glorious. Isai. 4. 2. Christ is so in
himself, and he is so unto them: and makes them to be
so. There is through him <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>excellency</hi> and <hi>comli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>
every thing that may make them lovely and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.
That the world looks not on them as such, is not
their fault, but the worlds misery: it looked on their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Christ himself, the brightnesse of his fathers glory,
who is altogether lovely, the chiefest of ten thousand,
with no other eye. Isa. 53. 2. They are so <hi>in themselves,</hi>
and are so to Christ; being exposed indeed to many tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations,
oftentimes they are made black and sully by
them: but yet they are <hi>comely</hi> still. Cant. 1. 5. The wayes
whereby they are made black for the most part, we have
expressed <hi>v.</hi> 6. when the Sun shines on them, and they are
made keepers of the <hi>Vineyard</hi> it comes upon them. Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and publick employment oftentimes so sully them,
that they are made black to the reproach of the world: but
yet to Christ who forgives, and washes them, they are
<hi>comely.</hi> Yea this is all the excellency that is in the world.
Sin with honour, with wealth, with power, with wisdom,
is a deformed and contemptible thing: it is grace onely
that is beautiful and <hi>glorious:</hi> it is the <hi>gratious</hi> onely that
are <hi>excellent</hi> in the earth. Psal. 16. 3.</p>
            <p>3. This alone makes any truely useful unto others; and
that either for <hi>preservation,</hi> or <hi>prosperity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Here lies the preservation of any nation from ruine.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:104602:10"/>
Isai. 65. 8. 9. <hi>Thus saith the Lord, as the new wine is found in the
cluster, and one saith, destroy it not, for a blessing is in it: so will
I do for my servants sake, that I may not destroy them all.</hi> This
is the <hi>blessing in the cluster,</hi> the hidden and secret blessing,
for the sake whereof, the whole is not destroyed. The
<hi>remnant</hi> left by the Lord of hosts Isa. 1. 9. that keeps the
whole from being as <hi>Sodom</hi> or <hi>Gomorrah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If <hi>Elisha</hi> a servant of the Lord told the King of <hi>Israel</hi> in
his distresse, that if he had not regarded the presence
of <hi>Jehoshaphat</hi> the King of <hi>Judah</hi> he would not so much
as have spoken to him; how much more will the
Lord himself let a people know in their distresse, that
were it not for the regard he hath to his <hi>secret ones,</hi> he
would not take the least notice (as to relief) of them or
their concernments. <hi>Sodom</hi> could not be destroyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
<hi>Lot</hi> was delivered. The whole world owes its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
and being, to them, whom they make it their
businesse to root out of it: they are as the foolish wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
that pulls down her own house with both her hands.
It is not your <hi>counsels,</hi> you know how they have been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
intangled, ensnared, it is not your Armies, as such;
what have they been to oppose against the mighty floods
that have risen up in this nation; and they also have
been as a reed driven to and fro, with the wind, (Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde
is no better; <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptists</hi> sayes it of himself)
but it is this presence of Christ in and with his, that hath
been the preservation of <hi>England,</hi> in the middest of all the
changes and revolutions that we have been exercised with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.
Mich. 5. 5.</p>
            <p>2. Not onely <hi>preservation</hi> but <hi>prosperity</hi> is from hence
also. Mich. 5. 7. <hi>And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst
of many people, as a dew from the Lord, as the showers upon the
grasse, that tarrieth not for man, that waites not for the sons
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:104602:10"/>
of men.</hi> It is the <hi>Remnant of Jacob,</hi> of whom he speakes,
that is, <hi>this people of Christ,</hi> with whom he is so present as
hath been manifested; and where are they; they are in the
<hi>midest of many people,</hi> in their <hi>inside,</hi> in their bowels; they
are woven by their Relations and imployments into the
<hi>bowels</hi> of the nations; and on that account there is neither
<hi>this</hi> nor any <hi>Nation</hi> about us, but shall spin out their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
or their misery from their own bowels; their provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential
fates lie in them; as is their deportment towards
this remnant, such will their issue be. But what shall this
<hi>remnant</hi> do? why it shall be be <hi>as dew from the Lord,</hi> and
as <hi>showers, on the grasse.</hi> It shall be that alone which makes
them <hi>fruitful,</hi> flourishing and prosperous; it may be it
will be so, provided there be good assistance, counsel and
strength, to carry on their affaires: yea blessed be God
for <hi>counsels,</hi> and for <hi>armies,</hi> he hath made them useful to
us: but the truth is, the blessing of this dew depends not
on them, it <hi>tarrieth not for man it waiteth not for the sons of
man:</hi> it will be a blessing, let men do what they will; it
depends not on their <hi>uncertain</hi> and unstable Counsel, on
their weak and feeble strength. This Remnant is as the
<hi>Ark</hi> in the house of <hi>Obed Edom,</hi> as <hi>Joseph</hi> in the house of
<hi>Potiphar,</hi> all is blessed and prospered for their sakes. It is
not the glorious <hi>battlements,</hi> the painted <hi>windows,</hi> the
crouching <hi>Anticks,</hi> that support a building, but the stones
that lie unseen in, or upon the earth. It is often those
who are <hi>despised</hi> and trampled on, that bear up the weight
of an whole nation. All the fresh springs of our blessings
are in <hi>Sion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It were easy to manifest that in all our late <hi>Revolutions</hi>
we have turned on this hinge. According as the presence
of Christ with his people, in the power of his spirit hath
received entertainment in these <hi>nations,</hi> so hath our state
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:104602:11"/>
and condition been. For many yeers before the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of these <hi>troubles</hi> the Land had been full of oppression,
I mean in respect to the people of God. Poverty, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment,
dangers, banishment, reproaches were their
portion. God was long <hi>patient;</hi> at length the heighth of
their Adversaries came to this, that they set not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
so much against their <hi>persons</hi> or wayes, as against
the spirit of Christ in and with them: that was made
their reproach, that the <hi>by-word</hi> wherwith they were des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pised
in the mouthes of their adversaries, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
multitude: when things were come to this, that the
very <hi>presence of Christ</hi> with his people, was made the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
object of the hatred of men, the Lord could bear it
no longer; but sware by himself, that <hi>time should be given</hi>
them no more: in this very <hi>house</hi> he raised up Saviours
and deliverers on mount <hi>Sion</hi> to judge the mount of <hi>Edom;</hi>
and how did he carry on his work, not by <hi>might, nor by
power,</hi> but <hi>by the spirit of the Lord of hosts:</hi> as Zac. 4. 6. Even
by that <hi>very spirit</hi> which had been reviled and despised.
Give me leave to say, the work <hi>of judging this nation</hi> was
carried on by the <hi>presence of the spirit of Christ</hi> with his in
faith and prayer: it was not by <hi>prudence</hi> of counsels, or
<hi>strength</hi> of Armies above that of our enemies, that we
prevailed, but by <hi>faith</hi> and prayer; and if any one be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
minded, I leave him for his resolution to the
judgement of the great day, when all <hi>transactions</hi> shall be
<hi>called</hi> over again: The Adversaries themselves I am sure
acknowledged it, when they openly professed, that there
was nothing left for them to <hi>overcome,</hi> or to <hi>overcome</hi> them,
but the prayers of the <hi>fanatick Crew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After some years contending, when the Lord had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
to give us <hi>deliverance</hi> by breaking the power of the
enemy, at least in this <hi>nation,</hi> besides those <hi>bitter divisions</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:104602:11"/>
that fell out among the people of God themselves, and
the backsliding of some, to the cause and principles
they had opposed, this <hi>evil</hi> was also found rising again a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us; <hi>slighting, blaspheming,</hi> contemning under seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
pretences, of the <hi>Spirit</hi> and presence of Christ in and
with his Saints: You know what ensued; what <hi>shakings,</hi>
what <hi>revolutions,</hi> with new wars, bloodshed, and desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
over the three Nations. And give me leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
you as one that had opportunity to make obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
of the passages of providence in those dayes, in all
the three Nations, in the times of our greatest hazards,
give me leave I say, to remember you, that the <hi>publick
declarations</hi> of those imployed in the affaires of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in the face of the enemies, their addresses unto God
among themselves, their <hi>prayers</hi> night and day, their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
discourses one with another, were, that the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the <hi>interest of Christ</hi> in and with his people was
the great thing that lay in their eyes; and that if it were
not so, they desired that God would <hi>stop</hi> them in their
way, yea rather cause their <hi>carcases</hi> to fall in the high
places of the field, then to prosper them in that which
should be <hi>contrary</hi> thereunto: and we know what ensued.
How we have used our mercies is another matter:
this was the Principle that prevailed with God and
man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. If you desire the <hi>Glory of these Nations,</hi> labour
to promote the <hi>interest of Christ</hi> in these nations; I am not
speaking unto you about <hi>disputable</hi> things, differences
among the people of God themselves, nor am I inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
my advise in <hi>your civil affaires,</hi> but I speak in
general about those with whom Christ is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
by his spirit, his chosen ones, against whom
there is an <hi>old enmity</hi> in Sathan and the world. The <hi>glory</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:104602:12"/>
of these nations is, that there is a <hi>people in them,</hi> that have
Christ in the midst of them; let it be your businesse to
take <hi>care</hi> for that Glory. But how shall we do it?</p>
            <p>1. Labour <hi>personally,</hi> every one of you to get Christ in
your own hearts. I am very far from thinking that a
man may not be lawfully called to magistracy, if he be not
a believer; or that being called, he should be impeded
in the execution of his trust, and place, becanse he is not
so; I shall not suspend my obedience whilst I enquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
my Lawful Governors conversion; but yet this I say
considering that I cannot much value any good, but whar
comes in by the way of <hi>promise,</hi> I confesse I can have no
great expectation from them whom God <hi>loves</hi>
not, delights not in; if any be otherwise minded,
I shall not contend with him; but for this I will
contend with all the world, that it is your duty to labour
to assure Christ in your own hearts, even that you may
be the better fitted for the work of God in the world. It is
the promise of God to Sion; that her <hi>officers shal be peace,
and her exactours righteousnesse,</hi> Isa. 60. 17. and then shall
she call her walls salvation, and her gates praise:
<hi>v.</hi> 18. It will be little advantage to any, to have the work
of God raised in the world, and not to have the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
stone laid in their hearts: If there should be in any
of you an enmity unto Christ, and the power of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse,
and hatred and contempt of the people of God,
an evil heart of unbelief, an evil course of life, <hi>worldlinesse,
oppression,</hi> vanity of minde, &amp;c. would it advantage you
to be entrusted with power in these nations? Would it
not hasten your destruction, and increase your account?
It is a noble promise that we have. Isai. 32. 17. <hi>And the
work of righteousnesse shall be peace, and the effect of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
quietnesse and assurance for ever.</hi> It is a Gospel righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:104602:12"/>
that is spoken of; and that not of the <hi>cause</hi> as
<hi>such</hi> onely, but of the <hi>Persons;</hi> the Persons being righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and that with the righteousnesse of Christ, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
mentioned, shall follow their righteous undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
we have peace now, outward peace; but alasse,
we have not <hi>quietnesse;</hi> and if any thing may be done that
may give us <hi>quietnesse,</hi> yet perhaps we may not have <hi>as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance;</hi>
we may be quickly shaken again; but when the
<hi>righteousnesse</hi> of the <hi>Persons,</hi> and <hi>cause</hi> meet, all the rest will
follow.</p>
            <p>2. Set your selves to oppose that <hi>overflowing flood of
prophanesse,</hi> and opposition to the power of Godlinesse,
that is spreading it self over this Nation. Know you
not that the Nation begins to be overwhelmed by the
powrings out of a profane, wicked, carnal spirit, full of
rage and contempt of all the <hi>work of Reformation</hi> that hath
been attempted amongst us? Do you not know that if
the former <hi>prophane principle</hi> should prove predominant
in this Nation, that it will quickly return to its former
station and condition, and that with the price of your
dearest blood; and yet is there not already such a <hi>visible
prevalency</hi> of it, that in many places, the very <hi>profession</hi> of
Religion is become a scorn; and in others, those old
formes and wayes taken up with greedinesse, which are
a badge of apostacy from all former ingagements and
actings; and are not these sad evidences of the Lords de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
from us; if I should lay before you a compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
between the degrees of the appearances of the Glory
of God in this nation, the steps wereby it came forth,
and those wherby it seems almost to be departing, it
would be a matter of admiration and lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
I pray God we loose not our ground faster then we
won it. Were our hearts <hi>kept</hi> up to our good old prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:104602:13"/>
on which we first ingaged, it would not be so with
us; but innumerable evils have laid hold upon us; and the
temptations of these dayes have made us a woful prey,
<hi>gray haires are here and there,</hi> and it will be no wonder if
<hi>our ruine</hi> should come with more speed, then did our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance.
O then set your selves in the gap; by all wayes
and means oppose the growth of an <hi>evil, prophane, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
malignant spirit</hi> amongst us. But I hast.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Value,</hi> encourage, and close with them, <hi>in</hi> and with
whom is this presence of Christ. They are the Glory of
the Nation; it's <hi>peace,</hi> safety and prosperity will be found
wrapped up in them. I know there lie divers considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
objections against the practise of this duty; I shall
name some few of them, and leave the exhortation unto
your considerations.</p>
            <p>1. Who are <hi>those</hi> persons in whom is this presence of
Christ? are they such as professe indeed <hi>Religion,</hi> but
neglect all <hi>Rules of righteousnesse;</hi> that would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
<hi>Godly,</hi> but care not to be <hi>honest?</hi> the <hi>markes</hi> of
whose miscarriages are written on their foreheads; are
not these so far from being the <hi>Glory,</hi> that they are the
<hi>shame</hi> of any nation. I pray give me leave to endeavour
the rolling away of this great stone of offence, in these
few ensuing considerations.</p>
            <p>1. Then I shall willingly lay this down for a principle,
<hi>that he is not Religious, who is not also Righteous;</hi> as also I
shall not much value his Righteousnesse, who is not Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious.
He that is righteous doth righteousnesse; he <hi>doth</hi>
so, in the bent of his spirit and course of his wayes and
walkings. If a man be <hi>froward, heady, highminded, sensual
unjust, oppressive, worldly, selfseeking, a hater of good men,
false, treacherous,</hi> let him pretend to what he will; that
mans religion is in vain; he may have a <hi>form of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:104602:13"/>
but he hath not the power of it. This principle we
shall agree upon;</p>
            <p>2. There have been in the dayes wherein we live, many
<hi>false professors, hypocrites,</hi> that have thought gain to be
Godlinesse, by reason of whose wicked lives, wayes and
walking, the <hi>name</hi> of God hath been evil spoken of; and
<hi>woe</hi> to them by whom these offences are come; but yet
also woe to the <hi>world</hi> because of offences; if these offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
turn off men, from an esteem of the Remnant of Christ
in whom is his presence, <hi>woe to them also.</hi> I acknowledge
these dayes have abounded with offences; but <hi>woe</hi> to them
who are turned aside by them, from owning the portion
and inheritance of Christ.</p>
            <p>3. It cannot be denied, but that many of them who do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
unto Christ, have woefully miscarried in these dayes.
O tell it not in <hi>Gath,</hi> publish it not in <hi>Askelon;</hi> Oh that our
souls could mourn in secret on that account, that we
could go <hi>backward,</hi> and cover the nakednesse and folly of
one another; but alasse, this hath been far from being our
frame of spirit; we have every one spread the <hi>failings</hi> of
his brother, before the face of men and devils; but yet
not withstanding these miscarriages, those that are the
<hi>people</hi> of Christ, are his <hi>people</hi> still; and he loves them still.
whether we will or no; and commonly those who are
least able to bear with the miscarriages of others, have
must of their own.</p>
            <p>4. That differences of <hi>judgments</hi> in civil affaires, or
<hi>Church matters</hi> ought not presently to be made Arguments
of men; not being <hi>Righteous.</hi> Some men think that none
are <hi>Righteous</hi> that are not of their principles; then which
principle there is nothing more unrighteous. Let men
that differ from them walk never so <hi>holily,</hi> professe never
so <hi>strictly;</hi> yet if they are not of their <hi>minde,</hi> they are not
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:104602:14"/>
Righteous. If men are offended on such accounts, it is
because they wil be so.</p>
            <p>5. This hath ever been the way of the men of the
world; that when any have been <hi>unblamable</hi> and zealous
upon the account of <hi>Religion,</hi> they will attempt their
Reputation, though without any ground or colour, upon
the account of righteousnesse. So suffered the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
of old; and so the <hi>Puritans</hi> of former dayes, unjustly
and falsly, as God will judge and declare. The world
then in this matter is not to be beleeved; the common
reports of it are from the devil, <hi>the accuser of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;</hi>
who accuses them in the same manner before God
night and day. These are but pretenses, whereby men ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of the mystery of the Gospel, and the power of
Grace, harden themselves to their ruine.</p>
            <p>6. This <hi>remnant</hi> of Christ with whom his presence is,
who are the glory of a nation, is to be found onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the <hi>professors</hi> of a nation. For although of those
who are <hi>professors,</hi> there may be many <hi>bad,</hi> yet of those
that are not <hi>professors,</hi> there is not one good. Where there
is faith there will be a <hi>profession.</hi> If I should not know
well where to finde them; I am sure I know where I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
finde them; I cannot finde them, in the wayes of the
world, and conformity to it; in darknesse, ignorance, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of dutie, and utter unacquaintednesse with Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
truths, the gifts and graces of the spirit; there I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
finde them; I shall not say of them, <hi>behold the Lords
anointed,</hi> let their outward worldly appearance be what
it will. now by the help of these considerations, those who
have in themselves principles of life and light in Christ,
will or may be, seting aside their temptations inabled to
discover this generation of the Lords delight; and for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
I cannot take down the enmity that God hath set
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:104602:14"/>
up. So then notwithstanding this objection I shall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
esteem this remnant of Christ to lie among those,
who haveing received <hi>Gospel light, and gospel gifts</hi> evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,
do make also profession of Gospel grace, <hi>union</hi>
and <hi>communion</hi> with Christ, seperation from the world,
and the wayes of it, in a conversation acceptable unto God
in Christ; and to this portion shall I say as <hi>Ruth</hi> to
<hi>Naomi.</hi> Let what will be glorious, or uppermost in the
world, <hi>whether thou goest I will go, where thou lodgest I will
lodge; thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God; the
Lord do so to me and more also, if ought part thee and me;</hi> with
them let my portion be, and the portion of my family,
whatever their lot and condition in this world shall
be; and the Lord say <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. But it will be said secondly, we are still at a
losse; for what woful divisions are there amongst this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation
of professors? some are for one way, and some
for another; some say one sort are the people of God,
some another; some say the <hi>Prelatists</hi> are so, some the
<hi>Presbiterians,</hi> some the <hi>Independents,</hi> some the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi>
some the <hi>fifth Monarchy men,</hi> some others, and on whom
should the valuation pleaded for be cast.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Some do say so, and plead thus, it cannot be
denied; but the truth is, the greater is their weaknesse and
folly. It is impossible men acquainted with the spirit of
Christ and the Gospel, should <hi>say so,</hi> unlesse they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the power of one <hi>Temptation</hi> or other. But it is no <hi>party,</hi>
but the <hi>party</hi> of Christ <hi>in</hi> the world, and <hi>against</hi> the world,
the seed of the woman, against the seed of the serpent
that I am pleading for; that men as to their interest in
Christ should be judged from such <hi>denominations,</hi> as
though they make a great <hi>noise</hi> in the world, yet indeed
signifie very little things in themselves, is most unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:104602:15"/>
and unequal; nor will men finde peace, in such rash
and precipitate judgments.</p>
            <p>2. There may be many divisions amongst the people
of God, and yet none of them be divided from Christ
the head. The branches of a tree may be entangled by
strong winds, and stricken against one another, and yet
none of them broken off from the tree its self; and when
the storm is over every one possesses its own place in
quietnesse beauty and fruitfulnesse. Whilest the strong
winds of temptations are upon the followers of Christ,
they may be tossed and entangled; but not being broken off
from the root, when he shall say to the winds, <hi>peace,</hi> be <hi>still,</hi>
they will florish again in peace and beauty.</p>
            <p>3. Let not Sathan cheat you of your duty, by this tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial
objection. If he can keep you from duty, whilst he
can make divisions; he hath you sure enough. They of
whom I speak, be they under what reproach or obloquies
soever, they are all true men, all the children of one fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
though they are unhappily fallen out by the way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse.</hi> 2. Of incouragement to those that have the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense
of Christ with them in the manner declared; they
shall be safe; In vain it is for all the world to attempt
their security; either they shall not prevail, or they shall
mischief themselves by their own prevalency. Mich. 5.
8. As they shall be a dew where they are appointed for
a blessing, so as a <hi>Lion,</hi> where they are oppressed. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
will come forth on their account, and that <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly</hi>
like the destruction of <hi>a Lion,</hi> speedily, in passing
through it shall be done. And whence is it that this fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
generation shall be as a Lion? It is from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of Christ among them, who is the <hi>Lion of the
tribe of Judah,</hi> and to honour them, he assignes that to
them, which is his own proper work; let men take heed
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:104602:15"/>
how they provoke this <hi>Lion:</hi> for the present (Gen. 49. 9.)
he is <hi>gone up from the prey,</hi> he stoopeth down, he coucheth
as a Lion and as an old <hi>Lion,</hi> who shall rouse him up?
He hath taken his prey in these Nations, in the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of many of his enemies: he seemeth now to take his
rest, to couch down, his indignation being overpast, but
who shall rouse him up? Why what if he be provoked?
what if he be stirred up? why he will not lie down, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
he eat of the prey, and drink the blood of the slain.</hi> Numb.
23. 24. There is no delivery from him: No, but what if
there be a strong combination of many against him, will
he not cease and give over? Isa. 31. 4. Be they who they
will, the <hi>sheaperds</hi> of the people, be they never so many
<hi>a multitude of them,</hi> let them lift up their voice and rage
never so much, all is one, he will perform his work and
accomplish it: untill you have him in the condition men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
Isai. 63. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Blessed are the people that are
under his care and conduct, yea blessed are the people
whose God is the Lord.</p>
