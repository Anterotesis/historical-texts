         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>in heauen, but in hell vnder the earth, and therefore Christ, which descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the place of soules, went down to hell vnder the earth,</hi> These places are; the first, Act. <hi>2. 27.

into hell, which is the priuate opinion of some learned men of our Church, yet in diuers places of the booke he rubbeth vpon <hi>Limbus Patrum:</hi> as may be euident to the reader in these three: first, pag. <hi>9.

Hence it followeth, that if Christ loosed the sorrowes of hell (and I thinke hee is not so absurd to thinke, that he loosed them for himselfe, who was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in the sorrowes of hell after his death) then it will follow that he loosed them for others, and for whom els, but for them which were there detained? The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place is, pag. <hi>36,</hi> where he striueth mightily, that the place in S. <hi>Peter</hi> must not bee read; <hi>the spirits which are in prison, but which were:</hi> whereupon it followeth, that they <hi>were in hell, but are not, to whom Christ preached;</hi> or els he striueth about words: his opinion then seemeth to be this, that some soules were in hell at Christs comming thither, which now are not. The third place, which I note, is pag. <hi>52,</hi> where he hath these words: <hi>In that Christ perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally descended into hell, it doth more amplifie and set foorth his goodnes toward mankinde, than his only comming downe into the world: for, so much as the more vile and loathsome the dungeon is, the greater is the loue of that Prince, who to enfranchise and set at libertie his captiues there enthralled, disdaineth not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:20714:6"/>
into it in his owne person.</hi> Now, who els can bee imagined to bee set at libertie in hell, but the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in <hi>Limbo Patrum?</hi> For out of the nethermost hell of the damned, of each side it is confessed none can be deliuered.</p>
            <p>Perceiuing then, how cunningly the Answerer doth seeke to winde in an old Popish error, setting his face one way, and going another: and as <hi>Hierom</hi> saith out of <hi>Plautus, To hold a stone in one hand, and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Juxta Plauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam sententia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, altera manu la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidem tenere, panem offerre altera. Hierom. Russin.</note> 
               <hi>reach bread with the other:</hi> I thought good to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>case this masking Mummer, and to pull off his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard: not preiudicing hereby by this speedie replie, the more mature and deliberate answere of those lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men that are by him taxed.</p>
            <p>But before I enter into any particular defence, foure things I would premonish this secret <hi>Censor</hi> of: first, that if he be a professor of the Gospell of Christ, what came in his minde to ioyne with the common aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie, in disgracing the defence of the Gospell by one vndertaken in his <hi>Synopsis:</hi> may I not say vnto him with the Prophet, <hi>Wouldest thou helpe the wicked, and loue them that hate the Lord?</hi> I may very fitly applie against him that saying of <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom; You that professe your selfe a</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Qui Christianum te dicis, Gentilium arma depone, aut si tu de numero hostium es, often de te liberè aduersarium, vt Ethnicorum suscipias vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nera.</note> [Protestant] <hi>lay aside the weapons of</hi> [Papists] <hi>or vncase your selfe, that we may know you to bee an aduersarie, that you may receiue the wounds of the</hi> [Papists].</p>
            <p>Secondly, it had bin much more commendable, if the <hi>Answerer</hi> had bent his force against the common aduersarie. There are lately diuers Popish bookes come
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:20714:7"/>
ouer, which might haue set him on work: what profit can it bee to him, the field being pitched against the Papists, to pick quarrels with his fellow souldiers? He might haue thought of <hi>Abrahams</hi> reason; <hi>Let there be no strife betweene thee and mee, for wee are brethren.</hi> But this is no straunge thing, for a man euen among his brethren &amp; companions often to find an aduersarie: as <hi>Origen</hi> well noteth vpon these words of our Sauiour, Mat. <hi>26. 23. He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish shall betray mee: This is the vse of many, that they lie</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Haec est consuetudo hominum multorum, vt post salem &amp; panem insidientur homini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus: etiam cum quibus ad eandem me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sam corporis Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti, &amp; ad e<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, it is against the rule of charitie, to bring mens priuate acts into publike view, and to proclame openly what is written secretly. Our blessed Sauiours rule is, <hi>If thy brother trespasse against thee, goe and tell him his fault betweene thee and him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, Matth. 18. 15.</hi> In my iudgement then the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plier had small cause to confute in print, a priuate let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter written to a Gentleman: It had bin a better course priuately to haue conferred with him, than publikely to haue censured him. <hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi> saith; <hi>If thou</hi>

               </note> 
               <hi>hast heard a word let it die with thee, for it will not burst thee. Hieroms</hi> counsel here had bin good; <hi>Other matters which you desire to</hi>

nor iudge, it may die in a faithfull eare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Christian policie would haue required, that seeing we all hold the foundation, The article of Christs descension, we should not raise any contention, or mooue questions about the manner, nor breake the peace of the Church, seeing there are most reuerend learned men of both opinions. But the Apostles reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution should stay vs: <hi>Let vs as many as be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect be thus minded, and if yee be otherwise minded, God shall reueale it vnto you, Philip. 2. 15.</hi> They which hold not the locall descent of Christs soule to hell, should not condemne the other as Popish or superstitious men, that are so perswaded: They which affirme it, ought not account them as enemies or aduersaries of the truth that dissent from them therein; they both holding the foundation. What in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate dealing then is this, for the Answerer in his Preface so vncharitablie to charge his brethren; <hi>irreligiously and vnchristianly to call the maine <note place="margin">Preface to the Christian rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> grounds and principles of our faith into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion?</hi> saying further, <hi>to plant by writing, or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by speaking, the cursed roots therof; to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a way to heathenish Paganisme;</hi> terming them further, <hi>prophane Anaxagorists, Masters of error, aduersaries of the truth?</hi> This is an hard course thus to censure men of the same profession, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they concurre not with him in the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of some places of Scripture. With how much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter moderation did the Reuerend Fathers of this Church, set down this article of Christs descension, in their Synode held <hi>anno 1562.</hi> that whereas the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle was thus framed before, in the Synode held <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:20714:8"/>
1552</hi> in King <hi>Edwards</hi> raigne: <hi>As Christ died for vs and was buried, so it is to be beleeued that he descended into hell: for his bodie lay in the graue vntill the Resurrection: his spirit being sent forth from him, was with the spirits which were detained in prison, or in hell, and preached vnto them, as testifieth that place of Peter.</hi> The Reuerend Fathers qualified it thus: <hi>As Christ died for vs and was buried, so also it is to be beleeued that he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t down to hel.</hi> Thinking it sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that we agreed in the substance of the article of Christs descension, though all consented not in the manner. And I could wish that wee might there hold vs, and that men content themselues with their priuate opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and seeke not one to grieue another with their mutuall inuectiues either in speaking or writing. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> saith well to <hi>Hierome: I am</hi>

               <hi>As for my part I will not deale of purpose with this question, as it is controuersed among our selues, nor reuiue any domesticall strife, but onely iustifie those places, which are vrged by some of our writers against the Popish opinion of Christs descending to</hi> Limbus Patrum, <hi>and are now by the Answerer either by name, or by way of consequence excepted against. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will I take vpon mee to defend others, whom hee personally toucheth, they are sufficient to speake for themselues: And I wish that from hencefoorth these home-bred quarrels may cease: and that one bond of</hi>

faith, in the diuersitie of some priuate opinions, may containe and keepe vs in peace: that same, <hi>vnum fidei lintheum, quod vidit Petrus, quatuor E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelijs alligatum: That sheet of faith, which Peter saw, tied with the foure Gospels in the corners:</hi> as <hi>Origen</hi> applieth it, <hi>Hom. 2. in Genes.</hi> Now I come to the particular examination of the places.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. But if it were admitted, that these words proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:20714:9"/>
could not be so taken here for the life and the graue, as yet is prooued before, and confessed by the Answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer: yet in regard of the manifold inconueniences, that would ensue vpon the other sense, a figuratiue speech should be admitted. First, one inconuenience <note place="margin">The inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences which follow in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding S. Peter to speake of hell, Act. 2. 27.</note> is the contradiction of Scripture; because elsewhere Christ saith, <hi>This day shalt thou be with me in paradise,</hi> Luk. 23. 43. which must be vnderstood of Christs soule, as shall be shewed afterward. Secondly, seeing Christ commended his soule into the hands of his father, it would follow, that descending into hell, and to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the infernall and damned spirits, should bee a commending of the spirit to God. Thirdly, this hell that Christ went to, <hi>hee loosed the sorrowes of,</hi> Act. 2. 24, which had seased vpon him, but could not hold and detaine him: but hell sorrowes hee neuer felt in that place of torment. Vpon these and other inconuenient and absurd consequents, we should be forced to finde out a figure in the vse of these words, if their proper signification did not beare that sense.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The inconuenience that he findeth out, that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Christs soule here for his whole person, it would follow that his bodie and soule should be in hell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, pag. 6, they neede not to feare that take the soule for the whole person; for the one part onely, namely the bodie is meant, that lieth in the graue, though the whole be named: as our Sauiour saith, <hi>Our friend Lazarus sleepeth,</hi> Ioh. 11. 11, and yet his bodie onely was asleepe. But whereas I rather take the other sense, that the soule here signifies <hi>life;</hi> this absurditie is further off then before: for this phrase is vsuall with the Prophet, to take his soule for the life; as Psal. 7. 2. <hi>Lest he deuoure my soule like a lion.</hi> Vers. 5. <hi>Let the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie persecute my soule and take it, let him tread my life downe vpon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust.</hi> Likewise Psal. 88. 3. <hi>My soule is filled with euils, and my life draweth neere to the graue.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. We rather affirme that the soule is taken here <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> for the life, the cause for the effect, than by a <hi>Synecdoche</hi> the part for the whole. And that the soule is taken for the life separated from the bodie, is euident by these places before alledged: Exod. 21. 23. <note place="margin">The soule ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the life.</note> 
                     <hi>He shall giue soule for soule,</hi> that is, life for life: his life shall be taken from him. So Numb. 23. 10. <hi>Let my soule die the death of the righteous.</hi> Here the soule separated from the body is taken for the life: for the soule dieth not, nor yet the life ceaseth not, as long as the soule is in the bodie.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though <hi>Dauid</hi> doth prophesie of Christ, yet so, as he speaketh in his owne person, as a type of Christ: so, that which historically was to bee performed in Christ, was typically true of <hi>Dauid,</hi> as shall be euen now shewed more at large.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Dauid</hi> in this place, though specially prophecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the death and resurrection of Christ, yet also sheweth his owne hope that hee had, when his flesh should rest in the graue, which he groundeth vpon the power and vertue of Christs resurrection: neither doth <hi>Dauid,</hi> where he vseth this phrase, speake onely of the soule ioyned with the bodie, but separated also from <note place="margin">

                     <hi>Obiect.</hi> 3. First, the word <hi>sheol,</hi> is ordinarily taken for

the infernall place of soules; for the graue seldome or neuer: <hi>Bellarm. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de anim. Christ. c.</hi> 10. Secondly, to the same purpose the Answerer alledgeth two places: Psal. 9. 17. and Psal. 31. 17. where <hi>sheol</hi> is taken for hell. <note place="margin">Pro sepulchro rarò velnun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam.</note> Thirdly, he telleth vs further, howsoeuer some curious Linguists may wrangle with the word <hi>sheol</hi> in the Old Testament, <hi>yet most certaine it is, that the Greeke word</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in saying, that <hi>sheol</hi> is seldome or neuer taken for the graue, doth not shew himselfe answerable to the opinion he would haue conceiued of his great learning: for beside these places already cited; Genes. 37. 35. Genes. 42. 38. 2. King. 2. 6. Psal. 6. 4, 5. Prou. 30. 16. Psal. 89. 48, where <hi>sheol</hi> cannot be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise taken than for the graue: whosoeuer list to make search, shall finde this word in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment oftner taken for the graue, than for hell.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Answerer hath made but bad choise of his two places: in both which the best Interpreters sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of this age, <hi>Pagnin,</hi> and <hi>Arias Montanus,</hi> and <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mellius</hi> doe translate <hi>sheol</hi> for the graue: for thus they reade; Psalm. 9. 17. <hi>The wicked shall be turned into the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Of the diuers acceptions of <hi>sheol</hi> in the Scriptures.</note> 
                     <hi>graue:</hi> Psal. 31. 17. <hi>Let the wicked be put to silence in the graue:</hi> for in hell, where there is weeping and gnash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of tecth, there is no great silence. But to yeeld him these places: what hath hee gained? hee fighteth but with his owne shadow: none that I know denieth, but that <hi>sheol</hi> is sometime taken for hell. Or if hee will bee thought to say somewhat; what kind of reasoning is this, <hi>sheol</hi> in two or three places is taken for hell, <hi>Ergo</hi> in all other places it is so taken?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And are they wranglers, that finde <hi>sheol</hi> taken in the Old Testament for the graue? See what a presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous censure hee giueth of all the learned Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters both old and new: and hee maketh himselfe a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:20714:11"/>
wrangler also, who findeth fault with his Antagonist for reading <hi>hell,</hi> and not the <hi>graue,</hi> in these two places Genes. 37. 35, and Psal. 6. 5. But <hi>Hades is not taken in the new, as Sheol in the old Testament.</hi> This word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, in this text, being cited out of the old Testament, must be vnderstood according to the phrase of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament: otherwise who knoweth not, but that some words borrowed out of the old Testament, are in the new vsed in another sense, than in the old? as the word <hi>gehenna</hi> is taken in the new to signifie hell, Mat. 5. 22. which in the old is called the valley of the sonne of <hi>Hinnon,</hi> Iere. 7. 31. where they tormented their sonnes, when they offered them vp in sacrifice to their Idols: whence they applied the name to signifie the place of torment for the wicked.</p>
                  <p>And whereas he would prooue, that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> here signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth hel, because the Apostle calleth it death, Act. 2. 24, he hath made a good argument against himselfe: for if hee make death and hell all one, then hee will fasten vpon Christ the death of hell, which is the second death. Neither will it helpe him, that the Syrian tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slator retaineth the same Hebrue word <hi>sheol:</hi> for wee must follow the authentike origin all, which is the Greeke: and yet the Syrian Interpreter readeth in the same place, <hi>sepulchrum,</hi> which I thinke vnderstood the <note place="margin">

                  <p>Is not this also a proper argument, S. Luke in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, Luk. 8. 31, taketh the word <hi>abyssus</hi> for hell, <hi>Ergo,</hi>

                     </gap> in this place signifieth hell? He that findeth such fault with the priuate writer for loose conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, should haue remembred himselfe to haue made better arguments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obiect,</hi> 4. In this place, the <hi>soule</hi> is opposed to the <hi>flesh,</hi> therefore two distinct parts must be vnderstood: <hi>Bellarm. ibid.</hi> To the same purpose the answerer, <hi>when the Scripture diuideth the kinds, as the soule and the body,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:20714:11"/>
it alwaies notifieth vnto vs two distinct things.</hi> But here, by the holie one, the flesh of Christ is vnderstood, as S. <hi>Peter</hi> expoundeth Act. 2. 31. and the Syrian doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly call it bodie. pag. 14.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Here wee haue another schollerlike argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: he would prooue <hi>idem per idem,</hi> the same thing by it selfe: the Scripture here diuideth the kindes of soule and bodie: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it speaketh of two distinct things of the soule and the bodie.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Indeede as you translate, the <hi>soule</hi> and the flesh must needes signifie the soule and the flesh: but the word <hi>nephesh</hi> doth not alwaies signifie the soule but the life, when it is named with the flesh: as Genes. 9. 5. <hi>the flesh</hi> with the <hi>nephesh, the life thereof, shall ye not eate:</hi> Leuit. 17. 14. the <hi>nephesh, the life of the flesh, is the bloud:</hi> and so is soule to be taken in this place for the life.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Syrian translator readeth thus: vers. 31. hee saw before and spake of the resurrection of Christ, <hi>that he was not left in the graue, nor his bodie saw corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> If ye will stand to your owne text, you are gone: for here no mention is made neither of his soule, nor of hel. The Latin text also readeth, for <hi>his soule, he,</hi> was not left in graue: wherefore these Interpreters by <hi>soule</hi> vnderstand himselfe, his person.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As the holy one, being the whole consisting of bodie and soule, is yet taken for a part, that is the flesh; so by the same figure, why may not the soule being but a part, be taken for his whole person?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obiect.</hi> 5. Now that they are two distinct seuerall clauses, is prooued by the two negatiue disiunctiue particles, <hi>not</hi> and <hi>neither</hi> carefully retained: as may <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </note> appeare Psal. 16. 5. and 44. 19. &amp;c. Ans. p. 13.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. His argument is weake, these words <hi>not</hi> and <hi>neither,</hi> in some places doe signifie two distinct things, therefore in all. In the 89. Psalme vers. 22. the Prophet saith, <hi>the enemie shall not oppresse him, nor the wicked hurt him:</hi> here these two negatiues, <hi>lo, lo,</hi> are
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:20714:12"/>
vsed, and yet there is no great difference in these two clauses. So likewise Psal. 31. 1. <hi>Mine heart is not exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nor mine eyes lifted vp.</hi> These negatiues iterated, shew no great diuersitie of matter.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But be it admitted that these particles doe inferre a distinction in the sentences, doth it follow, These are two diuers clauses, <hi>Ergo,</hi> one must be referred to the soule, the other to the bodie?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Neither doe wee say, that these words containe a superfluous repetition of the same thing: for the latter sentence expoundeth the former: that although the life of Christ seemed to be raked vp in the graue, yet his life should not so leaue him, but that his bodie being preserued from corruption, should presently be raised vp againe: the second clause therefore sheweth, how and in what manner, Christs life and person was not forsaken, in that his bodie by the power of God was defended from corruption. And such are the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections, as wee haue heard, against the exposition of the first place: our arguments follow for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation thereof.</p>

The assumption, or second part is prooued by the Scripture: Coloss. 2. 14. 15. <hi>Hee hath blotted out the hand-writing of ordinances, which was against vs, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened them to the crosse, &amp;c. and hauing spoiled principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and powers, hath made a shew of them openly, trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing ouer them in the same.</hi> So readeth and expoundeth <hi>Origen</hi> this place, of Christs triumph vpon the crosse: vpon these words, Numb. 24. 9. <hi>He couched as a young lion: He lay downe like a lion, when hanging</hi>

the first escaped out of the snare: the diuell reioyced when Christ was dead, but by his death he was ouercome: he took his baite as in a trap: the crosse was the trap, the bait that caught the diuell was our Lords death. Durand</hi> a Popish champion vrgeth this very argument against Christs descension, because in the very instant of Christs death the soules of the faithfull were deliuered and made happie: and therefore Christ needed not to descend for any such cause. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is driuen here to this shift: to graunt, <hi>that although the presence of Christs</hi>

Can this be called a commending of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit into the hands of God, to goe downe to hell, and to remaine among the infernall spirits? Again: if they that die in the Lord doe after death rest from their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, Reuel. 13. 14. much more the Lord himselfe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted from his labours after his death: but if hee had hell to conquer and the Patriarks to deliuer after his death, a great part of his labour remained: what then is become of that <hi>consummatum est,</hi> all was finished vpon the crosse, Ioh. 19. 30. that is, whatsoeuer apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to Christs suffrings, trauaile and labour, was now accomplished: his glorie victorie and triumph onely remained. <hi>Augustine</hi> hereunto giueth some light, thus applying these words of Christ, <hi>My soule is heauie vnto death: Tristis vs<expan>

                  <p>The first part is prooued by the words of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, Luk. 23. 43. vttered to the conuicted theefe: <hi>This day shalt thou bee with mee in paradise:</hi> which words <note place="margin">Christs words to the theefe must be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of the presence of his soule in Paradise.</note> must be vnderstood of the presence of Christ in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, not in respect of his Godhead onely, but of his whole person, as hee was the Mediatour. And that hee directly speaketh of the presence of his soule in para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, it may euidently appeare by these reasons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Christ answereth the theefe according to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest: but he desireth to be remembred, when hee as the Messiah should enter into his kingdome: <hi>Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member me when thou commest into thy kingdome:</hi> but Christ as God was neuer out of his kingdome.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The phrase of speech giueth this sense: Christ is said to be with vs, in respect of his Godhead: Mat. 28. 20. <hi>I am with you to the end of the world:</hi> but we are said to be with him, as our Messiah: as S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>I desire to be dissolued and to be with Christ,</hi> Philip. 1. 23. <hi>Bernard</hi> noteth this distinction well: <hi>Christ us nobiscum est, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3.

                     <hi>was called into paradise, shall wee thinke any to bee so impious that dare say, that the soule of our Sauiour was three daies kept in hell by his bodily death?</hi> He reasoneth from the lesse to the greater, that if the theeues soule went presentlie to Paradise, much more Christs. For whereas our Sauiour saith; <hi>Where I am, there shall my seruant be,</hi> Ioh. 12. 26. it must follow, that either the soule of the theefe must be in hell with Christs, or that Christs soule was in para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise with the theeues: for it were a dishonour, for the seruant to preuent the Master: <hi>The seruant is not grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than his Master,</hi> Ioh. 13. 16. but now should the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant haue the preeminence, if his soule should goe to paradize, and his Masters to hell.</p>

what went before and after these words, <hi>with me, where I am,</hi> he would not haue vented foorth such an vncertaine glosse: for first our Sauiour saith, <hi>I will, that they which thou hast giuen me be with me:</hi> were they gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto him as God? I thinke not, for who can giue vnto God? then they were giuen vnto him as the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah: he therefore prayeth, they may be with him, as the Messiah.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It followeth immediatly, <hi>that they may behold my glorie, which thou hast giuen mee:</hi> doth hee not speake here also of that glorie, which was giuen him as the Messiah, for the which he prayeth vers. 5. <hi>and now glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie me, &amp;c?</hi> I trust, as he is God, he praieth not for glorie to bee giuen him: for hee that prayeth, is inferiour in that hee prayeth: But Christ as hee is God is not infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to his Father. Doth hee then pray as God, that they may bee with him? take heede of Arianisme, if you be too rash in this point: he prayeth then as the Messiah.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> saying <hi>where I am,</hi> speake of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, his request was euen then fulfilled: for his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles were with him then present as God: for his Godhead filleth heauen and earth: But his request was, not then, but in his kingdome of glorie fulfilled: therefore he speaketh not of his Godhead.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Though our Sauiour speake in the present tence, <hi>where I am;</hi> that is so spoken, in respect of the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and certaintie of his kingdome purchased for his: which was as sure, as if alreadie he were in it: and so doth our Sauiour with like certaintie pronounce of those which beleeue in him, that <hi>they haue euerlasting life, and are passed from death to life.</hi> Ioh. 5. 24.</p>

                     <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. These sorrowes of death had fastened of Christ, though they could not still hold him, because <note place="margin">Christ loosed not the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes of hell after his death.</note> they remained to the resurrection: for this followeth as a reason of Christs raising vp: <hi>whom God raised vp loosing the sorrowes of death:</hi> if the sorrowes of the death and graue had not kept Christ a while, hee should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently haue been raised vp. 2. Againe, Christ could not be held or detained of death: death then had fastened vpon him, but could not hold him. One cannot be said to let go their hold, or not to be able to hold, vnlesse first they lay on hold: but hell sorrowes did not so much as assay or assaile Christ after his death.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He saith that Christ loosed the sorrowes of hell not for himselfe, but for others. Our answerer also hath the like saying: <hi>S. Peter mentioneth sorrowes, which were loosed at Christs resurrection, which could not be in the sepulcher, where his body lay dead and senselesse.</hi> Ans. pag. 9.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. The Apostle speaketh directly of Christ: the sorrowes were loosed for him that was raised vp;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:20714:17"/>
but Christ onely was raised vp. The sorrowes of death were loosed onely for him that could not be held of them; but Christ onely could not be held of them: <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> the sorrowes of death here spoken of were onely loosed for the resurrection of Christ.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As for our answerers position, it doth manifestlie <note place="margin">The answerer detected to be a Limbist.</note> bewray him to bee a <hi>Limbist:</hi> for if Christ loosed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, and not for his bodie which was senselesse, then hee must either graunt, that the sorrowes of hell were vpon Christ himselfe, of the which hee was loosed at his resurrection, or that hee loosed them for others: and so hee is detected to be also an hell-harrower, for the soules of the Fathers deliuered thence.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. What then though Christs bodie were without sense in the graue? We say not it felt sorrowes, but was vnder the sorrowes or bonds of death: for it was a time and state of sorrow, while Christs bodie lay in the graue, till it was raised vp againe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. S. <hi>Peter</hi> saith, vers. 31. <hi>he spake of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of Christ, that his soule should not be left in hell or the graue, &amp;c.</hi> The Prophet in these words speaketh of Christs resurrection: but the descending of Christs soule to hell belongeth no waies to his resurrection, but the not leauing of his life in the graue implieth the resurrection: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Prophet meaneth no such being or going of Christs soule to hell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. That which <hi>Dauid</hi> prophecieth of Christ was wholly and fully performed in Christ, and not in <hi>Dauid:</hi> But the not being or leauing of the soule in hell was as well performed in <hi>Dauid,</hi> as in Christ, for his soule was not at all in hell: <hi>Ergo, Dauid</hi> prophesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not of the not leauing of Christs soule in hell.</p>
                  <p>First, for the proposition the Answerer telleth vs, that the true <hi>Antithesis between Christ and Dauid is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his incorruption, resurrection and ascension, and not in any thing els.</hi> pag. 17.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Contra.</hi> The whole prophecie of Christ, <hi>Thou shalt
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:20714:17"/>
not leaue my soule, nor suffer thy holy one to see corruption;</hi> is by the Apostle applied to Christ, vers. 31, and denied to <hi>Dauid,</hi> ver. 29. for the whole is a peculiar prophecie of Christ: <hi>he spake of the resurrection of Christ,</hi> vers. 31, in this whole sentence, not partly of Christ, partly of them both. This prophesie then was historically onely true of Christ, though typically and in some similitude also it agreeth to <hi>Dauid,</hi> who hoped in Christ to rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and not for euer to dwell in corruption: but li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally the whole prophesie is referred to Christ, as S. <hi>Peter</hi> expoundeth.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Obiect.</hi> 1. <hi>If the meaning be that Christ dying in the flesh, was raised to liue by his diuine spirit: it ascribeth a foule error to the Apostle, as placing Christs resurrection befare his descension; whereas Peter speaketh not at all here of the resurrection, &amp;c.</hi> Ans. p. 22.</p>

                     <hi>Ans.</hi> First, here is no mention of Christs descension
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:20714:18"/>
at all: thus he beggeth the thing in question, and buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vpon that which is most doubted of. Secondly, if the Apostle had treated of Christs descension before his resurrection; is this such a foule error, in the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of things, not to obserue the order of time? Doth not S. <hi>Paul</hi> as much, that first speaketh of Christs ascension, Ephe. 4. v. 8. and afterward of his descension, vers. 10? Thirdly, how can he say that in this place hee speaketh not all of the resurrection of Christs bodie, when he maketh direct mention thereof, vers. 21. <hi>by the resurrection of Iesus Christ, &amp;c?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obiect.</hi> 2. <hi>Here is no opposition betweene the humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and diuinitie of Christ, because he speaketh of the death and passion of Christ, which touched his humanitie onely.</hi> Ans. p. 24.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> First, is not here now a good argument: the Apostle speaketh of that which concerneth Christs humanitie onely: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he toucheth not his diuinitie? To make it a good argument, hee should haue said, he speaketh <hi>onely of the death and passion &amp;c.</hi> Secondly, but then had hee said vntruly, for the Apostle maketh expresse mention of his quickning in the spirit, which is no part of his death or passion.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Thus hee still committeth the same fault, which is called <hi>petitio principij,</hi> the begging of the question: for this is the point controuerted, whether by the flesh and spirit, Christs bodie and soule are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood. 2. Though the Syrian Interpreter reade bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, yet so doth not the originall, which we are to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. 3. And though by flesh, Christs bodie be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, yet it followeth not that the spirit signifieth the soule: for the like opposition is vsed by the Apostle, Rom. 1. 3, betweene the flesh and the spirit, where, by the spirit, the diuine nature is manifestly expressed.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The answerer much contendeth, pag. 25, to haue the preposition <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Obiect.</hi> 5. <hi>If by flesh you vnderstand the whole humane nature, that is, his body and soule, then it will follow that he was done to death both in body and soule.</hi> Ans. p. 24.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> First, there is no more necessitie here, by flesh <note place="margin">What is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood by this word <hi>flesh.</hi>
                     </note> to vnderstand the whole humanitie of Christ, his soule and bodie; than in that place of S. <hi>Paul</hi> named before Rom. 1. 3, <hi>Christ was made of the seede of Dauid ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the flesh.</hi> Here the flesh, that is Christs hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie, is set against the spirit, his diuinitie: and yet if the soule should necessarily be comprehended vnder the name of flesh, it would follow that Christ receiued his soule from the seed of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and so <hi>anima</hi> should be <hi>ex traduce;</hi> be deriued from the parents, as the flesh is: whereas the Scripture saith, that God formeth the spirit of man within him, Zachar. 12. 1. Secondly, yet if the soule be here conceiued, no great absurditie will follow: for either by being mortified according to the flesh, all other suffrings are implied: as S. <hi>Paul</hi> set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down a briefe summe of the Gospell, <hi>that Christ died for our sins, was buried &amp; rose again, &amp;c.</hi> 1. Cor. 15. 3.

by dying vnderstandeth all other of his suffrings: as S. <hi>Peter</hi> saith, <hi>he hath suffered for our sinnes,</hi> 1. Pet. 2. 18: or els such a death of the soule may be vnderstood, as Christs soule was subiect vnto, neither by <hi>sinne,</hi> nor <hi>damnation,</hi> but in respect of his inward afflictions: in which S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>I die daily,</hi> 1.

thus wrote: so that by the figure <hi>Prolepsis,</hi> which is vsuall in Scripture, he describeth them by their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent state, not as they were at the time of the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. So in the next chapter he saith, the Gospell was preached to the dead: now dead, but then liuing when the Gospel was preached: as <hi>Augustine</hi> well expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth: <hi>It appeareth by the circumstance of</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Obiect.</hi> 8. <hi>To denie the word</hi> spirit <hi>in this place, as also the word</hi> soule <hi>in the prophecy of Dauid to signifie the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane soule of Christ, iustifieth those wicked heretikes which denied Christ to haue an humane soule, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently condemneth those good Catholikes, which by these testimonies of holy Scripture conuinced them, as Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius, Epiphanius, Fulgentius, Theodoretus, &amp;c.</hi> Ans. p. 48.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The argument is denied: for thus the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is framed; if the spirit here doe not signifie Christs soule, then the heretikes are iustified that say Christ had no soule: as though there were no other place of Scripture to prooue that Christ had an humane soule. 2. But diuers Fathers conuicted the heretikes, that so thought, by these places. They might dispute against them, but confute them they could not by a place of Scripture mistaken: to ouerthrow one error by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is but to establish error. <hi>Augustine</hi> hath a good saying to this purpose: <hi>It were lesse danger</hi>

The Fathers haue found out more pregnant places to prooue that Christ had a soule, than this. As that scripture was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly alledged against the Monothelites, to shew
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:20714:20"/>
that Christ had two willes, an humane and diuine will, by <hi>Athanasius, Origen, Agatho, Chrysostome,</hi> as they are alledged in the sixt generall Councell assembled against the Monothelite heretikes.

Is their authoritie good for the descension of Christs soule, and is it not as strong for <hi>Limbus Patrum?</hi> Will you receiue them for the one, and refuse them in the same place and sentence for the other?</p>

                     </gap>, to preserue and to make aliue. Secondly; and was he so blind, that he could not see, that the Prophet here speaketh in the same sentence, as well of <hi>killing of soules, as preseruing soules aliue?</hi> how then is he so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfull, to say, that this place prooueth, that the soule, <hi>which cannot die,</hi> is yet said to be <hi>viuified?</hi> Thirdly, he misreporteth his words, whom he blazeth in his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin: for it any list to see the place the words are these: <hi>Secondly the examples are not alike, for they are said to be</hi>

                     <hi>reuiued, because they might die, though they died not; but the soule cannot die: wherefore vnlesse he can shew out of scripture, that some thing is said to bee reuiued, or quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that neither doth nor can die, he faith nothing; but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath he nor can produce any such such example out of scripture.</hi> Is not the summe of the words euidentlie this, that nothing is said in scripture to be quickened, but that which also may die, either a naturall or a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall death? The soule as it may spiritually liue, so it may spiritually die: as the Prophet speaketh both of killing and sauing of soules in the same place. He shall neuer bee able to shew out of scripture any such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample or place, that affirmeth anything to be quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:20714:22"/>
which is not apt to die in the same sense. Christs soule then being not subiect to any spirituall death, either by sin in this life, or by damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in hell, cannot be said to be quickened.

We can giue him many reasons, why Christ is said to haue preached in the daies of <hi>Noe,</hi> rather than in any other time. 1. Because he onely was in those dayes in all the world, <hi>the preacher of righteousnesse,</hi> 2. Pet. 2. 5. and the like example cannot be shewed againe in all the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. 2.

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:20714:25"/>
speake euill of our conuersation in Christ, 16; from the efficient cause, the will of God, vers. 17: then hee doth illustrate his doctrine by two examples; first of Christ, who suffered as a iust man, and was sustained in his suffrings and quickened againe; secondly of <hi>Noah,</hi> whom the Lord vpheld in his preaching and profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, against all the professors of the old world, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning them, and sauing him. 3. Because this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Noahs</hi> deliuerance by the Arke did mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster iust occasion to the Apostle to speake of Baptisme, where of the other was a figure, of the which he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to speake.

The preaching of Christ to the spirits in prison, sometime disobedient in the daies of <hi>Noe,</hi> is a forme and figure of the state of the Church vnder the Gospell: for so S. <hi>Peter</hi> seemeth, not onely to make the Arke a figure, but the whole storie: for the word that signifieth the Arke, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, is of the neuter: so that the meaning is, to the which (not Arke) but to the which thing, Baptisme agreeth, &amp;c.

                  <p>But Christs descending in soule to hel hath no figure or forme of things to come: for Christ is the bodie, not the shadow, Coloss. 2. 17: yet the preaching of Christ by <hi>Noah</hi> to the disobedient world, and the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of him and the rest in the Arke, is a liuely forme and patterne of the state of the Church now: as <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> expoundeth; <hi>They which now beleeue</hi>

                  <p>First, whereas the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> thus prophesieth of Christ: <hi>I haue giuen thee for a light to the Gentiles, &amp;c. that thou maist bring out the prisoners from the prison, and those that sit in darknes from the prison house,</hi> Esai. 42 vers. 7: which words haue some agreement with this of <hi>Peter: Hierom</hi> vpon this place, and <hi>Cyrill</hi> both, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>or.</hi> 2, vnderstand this prison of the bonds of sinnes and errors.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Athanas. apud Epiphan. haeres.</hi> 77. saith, <hi>That the word himselfe went and preached to the spirits.</hi> It was his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine nature, not humane soule.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Beda,</hi> as hee is cited by reuerend D. <hi>Fulke,</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other a most pregnant witnesse: for thus he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth this place: <hi>He which in our times comming in the flesh, preached the way of life to the world, euen he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self also came before the flood, and preached to them which were then vnbeleeuers, and liued carnally: for euen by his holy spirit hee was in Noe, and the rest of the holy men which were at that time, and by their good conuersation preached to the wicked men of that age, that they might be conuerted to better manners.</hi> It is euident then, that this exposition is not newly deuised, but such, as many hundred yeeres agoe was approoued and receiued by that reuerend Father <hi>Beda,</hi> and others.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, <hi>Augustine</hi> (as we haue seene before) will by no meanes haue this place expounded of Christs go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in soule to hell.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans. Augustines</hi> words are these: <hi>Quis nisi infidelis negauerit fuisse apud inferos Christum?

                  <p>
                     <hi>Obiect.</hi> 3. <hi>Augustine</hi> determineth no certaintie tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this matter, but leaueth it doubtfull to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration and iudgement of others. pag. 42.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Obiect.</hi> 1. The word vsed by the Apostle, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, the lowest parts of the earth; in Hebrue <hi>tachtijoth arets,</hi> signifieth the place appointed for the damned: as Ezech. 31. 14. and 32. 24. Ans. p. 50.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The words of the Prophet in the first place are these: <hi>They are deliuered to death in the nether parts of the earth, in the middest of the children of men, among them that goe downe to the pit:</hi> And in the other thus:
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:20714:29"/>
                     <hi>They are gone down with the vncircumcised to the nether parts of the earth &amp;c. with them that go downe to the pit, &amp;c.</hi> Now, although we denie not but that these places <note place="margin">The lowest parts of the earth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies taken for hell.</note> may be expounded of hell, as <hi>Hierom</hi> doth: yet the circumstances of the place will rather leade vs to take it for the graue: First, because there are two words ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which are properly so taken: as <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>bhor,</hi> which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth a pit, and is translated by the 70: sometime <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, sometime <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to descend into the pit or caue: and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>cheuer,</hi> also which properly signifieth a graue is ioyned with the rest: <hi>whose graues are made in the side of the pit,</hi> Ezech. 31. 23. Secondly, the phrase of speech also giueth this sense, Ezech. 31. 18. <hi>Thou shalt sleepe in the middest of the circumcised with those that are slaine by the sword:</hi> and Ezech. 31. 27. <hi>They are gone downe to the graue with their weapons of warre.</hi> Now in hell men sleepe not, neither is that a place for the slaine, for the soule dieth not: neither doe men carrie their weapons thither. Thirdly, <hi>Iunius</hi> in these places interpreteth <hi>sheol, sepulchrum,</hi> the graue.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though we admit, that in these places it may be taken for hell, yet it is not so alwaies taken: as Psal. 63. 9, <hi>They that seeke my soule to destroy it, shall goe downe into the lowest parts of the earth:</hi> then it followeth vers. 10. <hi>They shall be a portion for foxes;</hi> but they that goe downe to hell are no pray for foxes: so likewise the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, Psal. 139. 15. <hi>Thou hast fashioned me in the lower parts of the earth.</hi> I trust they will not say hee was borne in hell. It is euident therefore that the Answerer more boldly than truly saith; that by these words, <hi>the lowest parts of the earth,</hi> Hell, the place of the damned, is alwaies signified: for vnlesse hee be able to proue that, he doth but trifle.</p>

                     <hi>Obiect.</hi> 2. <hi>The more vile and loathsome the dungeon is the greater the loue of the Prince, who to set at libertie his captiues there inthralled, disdaineth not to enter into it, in his owne person, &amp;c.</hi> Ans. p. 52.</p>

                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. You haue well reasoned for <hi>Limbus Patrum:</hi> you would dissemble your fansie that waies, but you cannot: I pray you what captiues were enthralled in hell, that Christ by going thither set at libertie? Let the indifferent Reader iudge, whether these words do <note place="margin">The Answerer detected to be a Limbist.</note> not smatter of <hi>Limbus Patrum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is denied, that Christs descension in soule to hell doth more set foorth his loue and fauour, than his crosse and passion. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> noteth this as the lowest point of Christs humiliation: <hi>He humbled himselfe, and became obedient vnto the death, euen the death of the crosse,</hi> Philip. 2. 8. And herein the Scripture doth chiefly set foorth the loue of Christ in dying for vs: <hi>who loued me, and gaue himselfe for me,</hi> saith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Galath. 2. 20. And in this consisteth the fauour of our Prince, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee hath visited from an high and redeemed his people, Luk. 1. 68.

The heauen and earth are as often <note place="margin">To lie owne in the graue is not to be in hell.</note> opposed one to the other in Scripture, as heauen and hell, which are set one against the other, not so much in respect of the distance of place, as different qualitie. Psal. 103. 11. the Prophet saith: <hi>As high as the heauen is from the earth, so great is his mercie toward them that feare him.</hi> Here the Prophet had occasion to alledge the places of greatest distance, to set foorth the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Gods mercie by way of comparison: but he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth not hell, but the earth against heauen.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obiect.</hi> 4. <hi>Christ before his ascension, led captiuitie captiue, as it is in the Psalme: but his conquest ouer his enemies, was not obtained by his comming downè from heauen, but by his passion on the crosse and his descending to hell:</hi> therefore that is the descending here spoken of.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> I will helpe you a little to gather your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into forme: that descending is here vnderstood, whereby Christ obtained conquest ouer his enemies: but this was done by his descension into hell, not by his comming downe from heauen. <hi>Ergo.</hi>

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:20714:31"/>
the while it was absent from the bodie, is contrarie to the Scripture: <hi>Thou wilt shew mee the waies of life, and shalt make me full of ioy with thy countenance,</hi> Act. 2. 28. <hi>Origen</hi> maketh Christs soule but one day in hell vpon these words: <hi>Hee shall raise vs after two daies; prima dies &amp;c. the first day to vs is the passion of our Sauiour; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunda qua descendit &amp;c. the second wherein he descended to hell; the third of the resurrection.

                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. Where Christ visited, thither he descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: but he did not visit hell, therefore he descended not thither. The proposition cannot be doubted of: the assumption is thus proued. Where Christ visited, he visited to redeeme; Luke 1. 68. <hi>Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, because he hath visited and redeemed his people;</hi> he visited them, to the end to redeeme them: but hee redeemed none in hell: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he visited not hell: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apostle speaketh of no descension thether.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. The lowest poynt of Christs humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was the lowest poynt of his descension: this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed: <hi>His ascension being but one exaltation, proueth that his descending likewise was but one humiliation:</hi> Ans. p. 55. So long then as he descended, he was in his humiliation: if Christ should be exalted in his descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, it were as much to say, hee ascended in descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. But this were absurd, as <hi>Origen</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth: <note place="margin">Si diligenter consideremus, inueniemus quia nunqua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quis in sanctum locum descendisse, neque ad vituperabilem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendisse praedicatur.

                     <hi>If wee diligently consider, we shall finde, that neuer any is said to descend into an holie place, or ascend to an vnnoble place.</hi> Christ then did not begin to be exalted, while he
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:20714:32"/>
was descending: But the death and passion of Christ and suffring vpon the crosse, and so consequently his graue, was the lowest point of his humiliation: Philip. 2. 8. <hi>He humbled himselfe and became obedient vnto the death, euen the death of the crosse. Ergo,</hi> Christ descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded no further, then to the crosse and his graue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. Christ ascended from that place whether he descended, but he ascended not in soule from hell: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he thither descended not.</p>
                  <p>The proposition is grounded vpon the Apostles words: <hi>now in that he ascended, what is it, but he descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded first,</hi> vers. 9.</p>
                  <p>The assumption is thus proued: Of the natiuitie, life, death, resurrection, ascension and all other actions per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by our Sauiour, the Apostles were witnesses. Act. 4. 20. <hi>We cannot but speake the things which we haue seene and heard.</hi> 1.

I will now lastly adioyne the exposition of some of the Fathers. <hi>Origen</hi> saith: <hi>Paulus quoniam descensionis Christi mysterium praedicat profundum no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minauit, quasi de superioribus ad inferiora venientis. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil.</hi> 2. <hi>in Genes. Paul because he preacheth the mysterie of Christs descension into hell, he named the deepe, as of one

comming from the higher to the lower parts.</hi> And againe the same <hi>Origen</hi> thus writeth: <hi>Descendere Deus dicitur quando curam humanae fragilitatis habere dignatur: quod specialiùs de Domino &amp; saeluatore nostro sentiendum est; descendit ergo, neque enim alius ascendit, quàm qui de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendit: descendit ergo Dominus non solum curare, sed &amp; portare, quae nostra sunt. Hom.</hi> 4. <hi>in Genes. God is said to descend, when he vouchsaseth to take care of humane frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which more specially is to be thought of our Lord and Sauiour: he descended therefore, for none other ascended but hee that descended: the Lord therefore descended, not only to care for, but to carrie our nature.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Augustine</hi> also thus witnesseth: <hi>Est quaedam coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stis habitatio Angelorum, illae pars rerum superna est, haec terrena vita vbi caro &amp; sanguis si illi comparatur infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na est, cum enim &amp; his sunt mortui, ne mireris si infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num dicitur.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Theodoret</hi> vpon this text thus writeth: <hi>His descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding doth not signifie any passing from place to place, but teacheth the greatnes of his dispensation, that when hee was most high, he abased himselfe so much, and endured so great abasement:</hi> He interpreteth as we doe of Christs humiliation and abasement here in earth.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, neither did all the Fathers agree in iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that Christ descended into hell to redeeme the soules of the Fathers. <hi>Origen</hi> saith, that where <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> bosome was, there were <hi>Angelorum chori; regnum Christi: The companies of Angels, the kingdom of Christ: in</hi> 1. <hi>cap. Iob. Chrysostome</hi> calleth <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome Paradise: <hi>Hom. de diuite. Augustine</hi> denieth it to be a part or member of hell: <hi>Epist.</hi> 99. In the opinion then of these Fathers, if Christ went to <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome, where the Fathers were, and that is not in hell: it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that the Fathers were not in hell, and so not deliuered by Christs descending thither.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, whereas he also produceth diuers new wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of his opinion: 1. Seeing they are but dumb wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, (they are only named, but speake nothing) a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour may be well spared in examining such silent te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies. 2. But herein hee can haue no aduantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs: for beside that wee can oppose against him as many new writers and more, that hold not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scension as he doth, as <hi>

                  <p>Fourthly, it is not to bee omitted, that euen many chiefe pillars and writers in the Popish Church, haue misliked such locall descent of Christs soule into hell, the place of the damned; vnderstanding that place in <hi>Peter</hi> of the operation of his diuine power in hell: this the Answerer himselfe denieth not to bee the opinion

All this also is by the Answerer acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest, p. 45. 46. Beside these, <hi>Durands</hi> opinion is, <hi>Christi</hi>

                     </hi> and for this cause <hi>Bellarmine</hi> taketh paines to confute him. Yea <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe confesseth, that, <hi>Licet non</hi>

Wherefore seeing neither out of Scripture, such locall descent of Christs soule into hell can be prooued, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were the ancient writers of one vniforme iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment herein, and both the professors of the Gospell doe disallow it, and Popish writers doubt of it: with what face can the Answerer affirme that his opinion, concerning Christs descension into hell, <hi>standeth as mount Sion, which cannot be remoued?</hi> pag. 58.</p>
                  <p>He saith not vntruly, <hi>that whosoeuer seeke to discredite this article of faith, corrupt and depraue the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and fall into diuers absurdities and impieties.</hi> For who denieth the article of Christs descension? We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that Christ euen vpon the crosse suffered the paines of hell: as Reuerend D. <hi>Fulk</hi> thus writeth; <hi>What may rather be called hell, than the anguish of soule, which <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> suffered, when being God he complained, that he was</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>forsaken of God?</hi> Wee also confesse, that Christ by his death ouercame hell, and shaked the powers thereof: that hee humbled himselfe to the ignominious death of the crosse, and descended from thence into the

graue, and there continued in the state of the dead till the third day, and whatsoeuer els may be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed in the article of Christs descension, hauing war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant out of the word. But to receiue such a sense as an article of our faith, which is not grounded vpon the Scriptures, wee dare not presume so farre without a warrant, nor be so bold where we haue no such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</p>
                  <p>To conclude then, I wish that from hencefoorth all such domestical contentions may cease: that we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our selues to beleeue as the Scripture teacheth vs: and that no man obtrude his priuate sense as an article of the faith. The common aduersarie will affoord vs worke enough, though we one prouoke not another: and so I end with that holie saying of S. <hi>Paul: Let vs follow the truth in loue:</hi> and to the Christian Reader I will commend that wise sentence of <hi>Augustine: Quis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis</hi>
