            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

First, to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Wrong his Lordship suffered, by a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and surreptitious Edition, of that <hi>Discourse</hi> of his, <hi>Touching a War with Spain,</hi> lately set forth. Secondly, by way of Prevention, to exempt from the like Injury and Defacements, those other <hi>Discourses</hi> of his, herein contained. Lastly, to satisfie the Desires of some, who hold it unreasonable, that any the Delineations of that Pen, though in never so small a Model, should not be shewn to the World. I know, it carries the Excuse with it, after the <hi>Authors</hi> Death, to publish <hi>Fragments.</hi> Therefore I will make none.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our Highness hath an <hi>Imperial Name.</hi> It was a <hi>CHARLES</hi> that brought the Empire first into <hi>France;</hi> A <hi>CHARLES</hi> that brought it first into <hi>Spain:</hi> Why should not <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> have his turn? But to lay aside all that may seem to have a shew of Fumes and Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and to speak Solids: A <hi>War</hi> with <hi>Spain,</hi> (if the King shall enter into it,) is a mighty Work; It requireth strong Materials, and Active Motions. He that saith not so, is zealous, but not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to knowledge. But nevertheless, <hi>Spain</hi> is no such Giant: And he that thinketh <hi>Spain</hi> to be some great Over-match for this Estate, assisted as it is, and may be, is no good Mint-man; But takes greatness of Kingdoms according to their Bulk and Currency, and not after their intrinsique Value. Although therefore I had whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sequestred my thoughts from Civil Affairs, yet because it is a new Case, and concerneth my Countrey infinitely, I obtained of my self, to set down, out of long continued Experience in Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Estate, and much Conversation in Books of <hi>Policy</hi> and <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,</hi> what I thought pertinent to this Business; And in all hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness present it to Your Highness; Hoping, that, at least, you will discern the strength of my Affection, through the weakness of my Abilities: For the Spaniard hath a good Proverb; <hi>Desuario siempre con la Calentura; There is no Heat of Affection, but is joyned with some Idleness of Brain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To a War are required; <hi>A Just Quarrel; Sufficient Forces and Provisions;</hi> And <hi>a prudent Choice of the Designs.</hi> So then, I will first <hi>justifie</hi> the <hi>Quarrel;</hi> Secondly, <hi>ballance</hi> the <hi>Forces;</hi> and lastly, propound variety of <hi>Designs</hi> for Choice, but not <hi>advise</hi> the Choice; For that were not fit for a Writing of this Nature; Neither is it a Subject within the Level of my Judgement, I being, in effect, a Stranger to the present Occurrences.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wars</hi> (I speak not of ambitious Predatory <hi>Wars,</hi>) are <hi>Suits</hi> of <hi>Appeal</hi> to the <hi>Tribunal</hi> of <hi>Gods Justice,</hi> where there are no <hi>Superiors</hi>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:64460:4"/>
on earth to determine the Cause. And they are (as Civil Pleas are) <hi>Plaints,</hi> or <hi>Defences.</hi> There are therefore three just Grounds of <hi>War</hi> with <hi>Spain:</hi> One <hi>Plaint,</hi> Two upon <hi>Defence. Solomon</hi> faith, <hi>A Cord of three is not easily broken:</hi> But especially when every of the lines will hold single by it self. They are these. <hi>The Recovery of the</hi> Palatinate; <hi>A just Fear of the Subversion of our Civil Estate: A just Fear of the Subversion of our Church and Religion.</hi> For in the handling of the two last Grounds of <hi>War,</hi> I shall make it plain; That <hi>Wars</hi> Preventive upon <hi>Just Fears,</hi> are true <hi>Defensives,</hi> as well as upon Actual <hi>Invasions:</hi> And again, That <hi>Wars Defensive</hi> for <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> (I speak not of <hi>Rebellion,</hi>) are most just; Though <hi>Offensive Wars,</hi> for <hi>Religion,</hi> are seldom to be approved, or never, unless they have some Mixture of <hi>Civil Titles.</hi> But all that I shall say in this whole Argument, will be but like Bottoms of Thred, close wound up, which with a good Needle (perhaps) may be flourished into large Works.</p>
                  <p>For the Afferting of the <hi>Justice of the Quarrel,</hi> for the <hi>Recovery of the</hi> Palatinate, I shall not go so high, as to discuss the Right of the <hi>War</hi> of <hi>Bohemia;</hi> Which if it be freed from doubt on our part, then there is no Colour nor Shadow, why the <hi>Palatinate</hi> should be retained; The Ravishing whereof was a meer Excursion of the first Wrong, and a Super-Injustice. But I do not take my self to be so perfect in the Customs, Transactions, and Priviledges of that Kingdom of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> as to be fit to handle that part. And I will not offer at that I cannot master. Yet this I will say (in pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage) positively, and resolutely: That it is impossible, an <hi>Elective Monarchy,</hi> should be so free and absolute, as an <hi>Hereditary:</hi> No more than it is possible for a Father, to have so full Power and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, in an Adoptive Son, as in a Natural: <hi>Quia Naturalis Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio fortior Civili.</hi> And again, that Received <hi>Maxim</hi> is almost Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaken and Infallible; <hi>Nil magis Naturae consentaneum est, quam ut iisdem modis Res dissolvantur, quibus constituuntur.</hi> So that, if the part of the <hi>People</hi> or <hi>Estate</hi> be somewhat in the Election, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make them Nulls or Cyphers in the Privation or Translation. And if it be said, that this is a dangerous Opinion, for the <hi>Pope, Emperour,</hi> and <hi>Elective Kings:</hi> It is true, it is a dangerous Opinion, and ought to be a dangerous Opinion to such personal <hi>Popes, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors,</hi> or <hi>Elective Kings,</hi> as shall transcend their limits, and become Tyrannical. But it is a safe and sound Opinions for their Sees, Empires, and Kingdoms; And for themselves also, if they be wise: <hi>Plenitudo Potestatis, est plenitudo Tempestatis.</hi> But the chief Cause, why I do not search into this point, is, because I need it not. And in handling the Right of a <hi>War,</hi> I am not willing to intermix mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doubtful, with that which is out of doubt. For as in Capital Causes, wherein but one Mans life is in question, <hi>in favorem vitae,</hi> the Evidence ought to be clear; So much more, in a Judgement upon a <hi>War,</hi> which is Capital to Thousands. I suppose therefore the worst; That the <hi>Offensive War</hi> upon <hi>Bohemia</hi> had been unjust; And then make the Case; Which is no sooner made, than resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64460:4"/>
If it be made, not enwrapped, but plainly and perspicuously. It is this in <hi>Thesi.</hi> An <hi>Offensive War</hi> is made, which is unjust in the Aggressour; The Prosecution and Race of the <hi>War,</hi> carrieth the <hi>Defendant,</hi> to affail and invade the Ancient and Indubitate Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the first <hi>Aggressour,</hi> who is now turned <hi>Defendant;</hi> Shall he fit down, and not put himself in <hi>Defence;</hi> Or if he be dispos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed, shall he not make a <hi>War</hi> for the Recovery? No man is so poor of Judgement, as will affirm it. The Castle of <hi>Cadmus</hi> was taken, and the City of <hi>Thebes</hi> it self invested by <hi>Ehaebidas</hi> the <hi>Lace demonian,</hi> insidiously, and in violation of League: The Process of this Action drew on a Resurprise of the Castle by the <hi>Thebans,</hi> a Recovery of the <hi>Town,</hi> and a Current of the <hi>War,</hi> even unto the walls of <hi>Sparta.</hi> I demand, was the Defence of the City of <hi>Sparta,</hi> and the Expulsion of the <hi>Thebans,</hi> out of the ancient <hi>Laconian Territories,</hi> unjust? The sharing of that part of the <hi>Duichy</hi> of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,</hi> which lieth upon the River of <hi>Adda,</hi> by the <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> upon Contract with the <hi>French,</hi> was an Ambitious and unjust Purchase. This Wheel set on going, did pour a <hi>War</hi> upon the <hi>Venetians</hi> with such a Tempest, as <hi>Padoua</hi> and <hi>Trevigi</hi> was taken from them, and all their <hi>Dominions</hi> upon the <hi>Continent</hi> of <hi>Italy</hi> abandoned, and they confined within the Salt Waters. Will any man say, that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable Recovery and Defence of <hi>Padotia,</hi> (when the Gentlemen of <hi>Venice,</hi> unused to the <hi>Wars,</hi> out of the love of their Countrey, became Brave and Martial the first day;) And so likewise the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adeption</hi> of <hi>Trevigi,</hi> and the rest of their Dominions, was matter of Scruple, whether just or no, because it had fource from a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel ill begun? The <hi>War</hi> of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Vrbin,</hi> Nephew to <hi>Pope Julius</hi> the second, when he made himself Head of the <hi>Spanish.</hi> Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineers, was as unjust, as unjust might be; A Support of desperate Rebels, An Invasion of St. <hi>Peters</hi> Patrimony, and what you will. The Race of this <hi>War</hi> fell upon the loss of <hi>Vrbin</hi> it self, which was the <hi>Dukes</hi> undoubted Right; Yet in this case, no Penitentiary, (though he had enjoyned him never so strait Penance to expiate his first Offence,) would have counselled him to have given over the pursuit of his Right for <hi>Vrbin;</hi> Which after he prosperously re-obtained, and hath transmitted to his Family yet until this day. Nothing more unjust than the Invasion of the <hi>Spanish Armada</hi> in 88. upon our Seas; For our Land was holy Land to them, they might not touch it: Shall I say therefore, that the Defence of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> or <hi>Cales,</hi> afterward, was unjust?. There be thousands of Examples; <hi>Vtor in Re non dubia Exemplis non necessariis:</hi> The Reason is plain; <hi>Wars</hi> are <hi>Vindicte;</hi> Revenges, Reparations. But Revenges are not infinite, but according to the measure of the first Wrong, or Damage. And therefore, when a voluntary <hi>Offensive War,</hi> by the Design or Fortune of the <hi>War,</hi> is turned to a necessary <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive War,</hi> the Scene of the Tragedy is changed, and it is a new Act to begin. For though they the particular actions of <hi>War,</hi> are complicate in Fact, yet they are separate and distinct in Right; Like to cross Suits in <hi>Civil Pleas,</hi> which are sometimes both just. But this is so clear, as needeth no further to be insisted upon. And

yet, if in things so clear, it were fit to speak of more or less clear, in our present Cause, it is the more clear on our part, because the Possession of <hi>Bohemia</hi> is setled with the <hi>Emperor.</hi> For though it be true, that, <hi>Non datur Compensatio Injuriarum;</hi> yet were there some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more Colour to detain the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> as in the nature of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, in Value or Compensation, if <hi>Bohemia</hi> had been lost, or were still the Stage of <hi>War.</hi> Of this therefore I speak no more. As for the Title of <hi>Proscription</hi> or <hi>Forfeiture,</hi> wherein the <hi>Emperor</hi> (upon the matter) hath been Judge and Party, and hath justiced himself, <hi>God</hi> forbid but that it should well endure an Appeal to a <hi>War.</hi> For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> is as well a <hi>Chancery,</hi> to save and debar Forfeitures, as a <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Common Law</hi> to decide Rights; And there would be work enough in <hi>Germany, Italy,</hi> and other Parts, if Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Forfeitures should go for good Titles.</p>
                  <p>Thus much for the first Ground of <hi>War</hi> with <hi>Spain,</hi> being in the Nature of a <hi>Plaint,</hi> for the <hi>Recovery of the Palatinate;</hi> Omitting here that which might be the Seed of a larger Discourse, and is verified by a number of Examples; That whatsoever is gained by an Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Treaty, ought to be restored <hi>in Integrum.</hi> As we see the daily Experience of this in <hi>Civil Pleas;</hi> For the Images of great things are best seen contracted into small Glasses; We see (I say) that all <hi>Pretorian Courts,</hi> if any of the <hi>Parties</hi> be entertained or laid asleep, under pretence of Arbiterment or Accord, and that the other <hi>Party</hi> during that time, doth cautelously get the start and advantage at <hi>Common Law,</hi> though it be to Judgement and Execution; Yet the <hi>Pretorian Court</hi> will set back all things <hi>in statu quo prins,</hi> no respect had to such Eviction or Disposition. Lastly, let there be no mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; As if when I speak of a <hi>War</hi> for the Recovery of the <hi>Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi> I meant, that it must be in <hi>lineae rectae,</hi> upon that Place: For look into <hi>Jus faeciale,</hi> and all Examples, and it will be found to be without scruple; That after a Legation <hi>ad Res repetendas,</hi> and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal, and a Denunciation or Indiction of a <hi>War,</hi> the <hi>War</hi> is no more confined to the Place of the Quarrel, but is left at large, and to choice, (as to the particular conducing Designs,) as Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Advantages shall invite.</p>
                  <p>To proceed therefore to the second Ground of a <hi>War</hi> with <hi>Spain;</hi> We have set it down to be, <hi>A just Fear of the subversion of our Civil Estate.</hi> So then, the <hi>War</hi> is not for the <hi>Palatinate</hi> onely, but for <hi>England, Scotland, Ireland,</hi> our <hi>King,</hi> our <hi>Prince,</hi> our <hi>Nation,</hi> all that we have. Wherein two things are to be proved. The one, that a <hi>Just Fear,</hi> (without an Actual Invasion or Offence) is a sufficient Ground of a <hi>War,</hi> and in the Nature of a true <hi>Defensive;</hi> The other, that we have towards <hi>Spain</hi> Cause of <hi>Just Fear;</hi> I say <hi>Just Fear;</hi> For as the <hi>Civillians</hi> do well define, that the Legal <hi>Fear is, Justus Metus qui cadit in constantem Virum,</hi> in private Causes; So there is, <hi>Justus Metus qui cadit in constantem Senatum, in causa publica;</hi> Not out of Umbrages, light Jealousies, Apprehensions a far off; But out of clear Foresight of imminent Danger.</p>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64460:6"/>
for <hi>Cause</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> but upon a Just <hi>Fear;</hi> For as much as it is a Fundamental Law in the <hi>Turkish Empire,</hi> that they may (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other provocation,) make War upon <hi>Christendom,</hi> for the <hi>Propagation</hi> of their <hi>Law;</hi> So that there lieth upon the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> a perpetual <hi>Fear</hi> of a <hi>War,</hi> (hanging over their heads,) from them: And therefore they may at all times, (as they think good) be upon the Prevention. <hi>Demosthenes</hi> exposeth to scorn <hi>Wars</hi> which are not Preventive, comparing those that make them, to Countrey Fellows in a Fencing-School, that never ward till the Blow be past: <hi>Ut Barbari Pugiles dimicare solent, it a vos bellum geritis cum Philippo, Ex his enim is qui ictus est, ictui sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per inhaeret: Quod si cum alibi verberes, illo manus transfort; Idum autem depellere, aut prospicere, neque scit, neque vult.</hi> As Country Fellows use to do when they play at Wasters, such a kinde of War do you (<hi>Athenians</hi>) make with <hi>Philip;</hi> For with them he that gets a blow, streight falleth to ward when the blow is past, And if you strike him in another place, thither goes his hand likewise: But to put by, or foresee a blow, they neither have the skill, nor the will.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Clinias</hi> the <hi>Candiaen,</hi> (in <hi>Plato</hi>) speaks desperately and wildly; As if there were no such thing as <hi>Peace</hi> between <hi>Nations;</hi> But that every <hi>Nation</hi> expects but his Advantage to War upon another. But yet in that Excess of Speech, there is thus much that may have a Civil Construction; Namely, that every State ought to stand upon his Guard, and rather prevent, than be prevented. His words are; <hi>Quam rem fere vocant Pacem, nudum &amp; inane No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men est; Revera autem omnibus, adversus omnes Civitates bellum sempiternum perdurat:</hi> That which Men, for the most part, call <hi>Peace,</hi> is but a naked and empty Name; But the truth is, that there is ever between all Estates a secret War. I know well this Speech is the <hi>Objection,</hi> and not the <hi>Decision,</hi> and that it is after refuted; But yet (as I said before) it bears thus much of Truth, That if that general Malignity, and Pre-disposition to <hi>War,</hi> (which he untruly figureth to be in all Nations,) be produced and extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a just Fear of being oppressed, then it is no more a true <hi>Peace,</hi> but a Name of a <hi>Peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the Opinion of <hi>Iphicrates</hi> the <hi>Athenian,</hi> it demands not so much towards a <hi>War,</hi> as a just Fear; but rather cometh near the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Clinias;</hi> As if there were ever amongst Nations a Brooding of a <hi>War,</hi> and that there is no sure League but Impuissance to do hurt. For he, in the Treaty of peace with the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth plain language, Telling them, there could be no true and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Peace, except the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> yielded to those things, which being granted, it would be no longer in their power to hurt the <hi>Athenians,</hi> though they would. And to say truth, if one mark it well, this was in all Memory, the Main Piece of Wisdom, in strong and prudent Counsels; To be in perpetual watch, that the <hi>States</hi> about them, should neither by Approach, nor by En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of Dominion, nor by Ruining Confederates, nor by Bloc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Trade, nor by any the like means, have it in their power
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64460:6"/>
to hurt or annoy the <hi>States</hi> they serve; And whensoever any such Cause did but appear, straightways to buy it out with a War, and never take up Peace at Credit, and upon Interest. It is so memorable, and it is yet as fresh, as if it were done ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterday, how that <hi>Triumvirate</hi> of <hi>Kings, (Henry</hi> the Eighth of <hi>England, Francis</hi> the First of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and King of <hi>Spain,)</hi> were in their times so provident, as scarce a Palme of Ground could bee gotten by either of the Three, but that the other Two would be sure to do their best to set the Ballance of <hi>Europe</hi> upright again.</p>
                  <p>And the like diligence was used in the Age before, by that League, (wherewith <hi>Guicciardine</hi> beginneth his Story, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it (as it were) the Kalendar of the good dayes of <hi>Italy,</hi>) which was contracted between <hi>Ferdinando</hi> King of <hi>Naples, Loren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo</hi> of <hi>Medici,</hi> Potentate of <hi>Florence,</hi> and <hi>Lodovico Zforza</hi> Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> designed chiefly against the growing Power of the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians;</hi> But yet so, as the Confederates had a perpetual eye one upon another, that none of them should overtop. To conclude therefore, howsoever some School-men, (otherwise Reverend Men, yet fitter to guide Pen knives than Swords,) seem precisely to stand upon it; That every <hi>Offensive War</hi> must be <hi>Ultio;</hi> A <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,</hi> that presupposeth a precedent Assault or Injury; yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do they descend to this Point, (which we now handle) of a <hi>Just Fear;</hi> Neither are they of Authority to judge this Question against all the Presidents of time. For certainly, as long as Men are Men, (the Sons, as the Poets allude, of <hi>Prometheus,</hi> and not of <hi>Epimetheus,</hi>) and as long as Reason is Reason, A <hi>Just Fear</hi> will be a Just Cause of a Preventive <hi>War;</hi> But especially, if it be Part of the Case, that there be a <hi>Nation</hi> that is manifestly detected, to aspire to <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and new Acquests; Then other <hi>States</hi> (assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly) cannot be justly accused for not staying for the first Blow; Or for not accepting <hi>Poliphemus</hi> Courtesie, to be the last that shall be eaten up.</p>
                  <p>Nay, I observe further, that in that passage of <hi>Plato,</hi> which I cited before, (and even in the <hi>Tenet</hi> of that Person, that bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Resolving Part, and not the Objecting Part,) a <hi>Just Fear</hi> is justified for a Cause of an <hi>Invasive War,</hi> though the same <hi>Fear</hi> proceed not from the fault of the Foreign State, to be assailed. For it is there insinuated, That if a State, out of the distemper of their own Body, do fear Sedition and Intestine Troubles to break out amongst themselves, they may discharge their own ill Humours, upon a Foreign <hi>War,</hi> for a Cure. And this kinde of Cure was tendred by <hi>Jasper Coligni</hi> Admiral of <hi>France,</hi> to <hi>Charles</hi> the Nineth, the <hi>French King,</hi> when by a vive and forcible Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, he moved him to a War upon <hi>Flanders,</hi> for the better Extinguishment of the <hi>Civil Wars</hi> of <hi>France;</hi> But neither was that Counsel prosperous; Neither will I maintain that Position; For I will never set <hi>Politiqu's</hi> against <hi>Ethicks;</hi> Especially for that true <hi>Ethicks</hi> are but as a Hand-maid to <hi>Divinity</hi> and <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> Surely, Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> (who had the largest heart of the

School Divines, (bendeth chiefly his stile against the depraved Passions, which reign in making <hi>Wars,</hi> speaking out of St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine; Nocendi Cupiditas, ulciscendi Credulitas, implacaius &amp; impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabilis Animus, Feritas Rebellandi, Libido Dominandi, &amp; si quae sunt similia, haec sunt qu ae in bellis jure culpaniur.</hi> And the same St: <hi>I hom as</hi> in his own Text, defining of the just Causes of a <hi>War,</hi> doth leave it upon very general Terms; <hi>Requirilur ad Billum Cause justa, ut sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licet illi qui impugnaniur, propter al qu im culpam, Impugnationem me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reantur;</hi> For <hi>Impugnatio Culpae,</hi> is a far more general word than <hi>Vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio Injurae.</hi> And thus much for the first <hi>Proposition,</hi> of the <hi>Second Ground</hi> of a <hi>War</hi> with <hi>Spain:</hi> Namely, that <hi>A just Fear is a just Cause of a War;</hi> And that <hi>A Preventive War is a true Defensive.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Second, or <hi>Minor Proposition</hi> was this, That this <hi>Kingdom</hi> hath Cause of <hi>Just Fear</hi> of Overthrow from <hi>Spain.</hi> Wherein it is true, that <hi>Fears</hi> are ever seen in dimmer lights, than <hi>Facts.</hi> And on the otherside, <hi>Fears</hi> use (many times) to be represented in such an Imaginary fashion, as they rather dazle Mens eyes, than open them. And therefore I will speak in that manner which the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject requires; That is, probably, and moderately, and briefly. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will I deduce these <hi>Fears</hi> to present Occurrences; but point onely at general Grounds, leaving the rest to more secret Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels.</p>
                  <p>Is it nothing, that the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> hath enlarged the Bounds thereof, within this last sixscore years, much more than the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans?</hi> I speak not of Matches, or Unions, but of Arms, Occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Invasions. <hi>Granada, Naples, Milan, Portugal,</hi> the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West Indies;</hi> All these are actual Additions to that <hi>Crown.</hi> They had a minde to <hi>French Britain,</hi> the lower Part of <hi>Piccardi,</hi> and <hi>Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont;</hi> but they have let fall their Bit. They have to this day, such a hovering possession of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> as an Hobby hath over a Lark; And the <hi>Palatinate</hi> is in their Tallons: So that nothing is more manifest, than that this <hi>Nation</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> runs a race (still) of <hi>Empire,</hi> when all other <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Christendom</hi> stand in effect at a stay. Look then a little further into the Titles, whereby they have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and do now hold these new Portions of their <hi>Crown,</hi> and you will finde them of so many varieties, and such natures, (to speak with due respect,) as may appear to be easily minted, and such as can hardly at any time be wanting. And therefore so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny new Conquests and Purchases, so many Strokes of the Larum-Bell of <hi>Fear,</hi> and Awaking, to other <hi>Nations,</hi> and the Facility of the Titles, which hand over head have served their turn, doth ring the Peal so much the sharper, and the louder.</p>
                  <p>Shall we descend from their general Disposition, to enlarge their Dominions, to their particular Disposition, and Eye of Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, which they have had towards us; They have now twice sought to impatronize themselves of this Kingdom of <hi>England;</hi> once by Marriage with Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> And the second by <hi>Conquest</hi> in 88. when their Forces by Sea and Land, were not inferiour to those they have now. And at that time in 88. the Counsel and Design of <hi>Spain,</hi> was, by many Advertisements, revealed and laid open to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64460:7"/>
be; That they found the <hi>War</hi> upon the <hi>Low <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> so churlish and longsome, as they grew then to a Resolution; that as long as <hi>England</hi> stood in state to succour those <hi>Countreys,</hi> they should but consume themselves in an endless <hi>War;</hi> And therefore there was no other way, but to assail and depress <hi>England,</hi> which was as a Back of Steel to the <hi>Flemmings.</hi> And who can warrant (I pray) that the same Counsel and Design will not return again? So as we are in a strange <hi>Dilemma</hi> of Danger: For if we suffer the <hi>Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings</hi> to be ruined, they are our Cut-work, and we shall remain Naked and Dismantled: If we succour them strongly, (as is fit) and set them upon their feet, and do not withal weaken <hi>Spain,</hi> we hazard to change the Scene of the <hi>War,</hi> and to turn it upon <hi>Ireland</hi> or <hi>England:</hi> Like unto <hi>Rheums</hi> and <hi>Destuxions;</hi> which, if you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a strong Repercussive to the Place affected, and do not take away the Cause of the Disease, will shift, and fall straightways to another Joynt, or Place. They have also twice invaded <hi>Ireland:</hi> Once under the <hi>Popes Banner,</hi> when they were defeated by the Lord <hi>Grey;</hi> And after in their own name, when they were defeated by the Lord <hi>Mountjoy.</hi> So as let this suffice for a Taste of their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position towards us. But it will be said: This is an Almanack for the old Year; Since 88. all hath been well, <hi>Spain</hi> hath not assailed this Kingdom, howsoever by two several Invasions from us migh tily provoked. It is true, but then consider, that immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 88. they were embroyled, for a great time, in the Protection of the League of <hi>France,</hi> whereby they had their hands full; After being brought extream low, by their vast and continual Embrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they were enforced to be quiet, that they might take breath, and do Reparations upon their former Wastes. But now of late Things seem to come a pace to their former Estate. Nay with far greater Disadvantage to us. For now that they have almost con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, and (as it were) arched their Dominions, from <hi>Milan,</hi> by the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> and <hi>Palatinate,</hi> to the <hi>Low Countreys;</hi> We see how they thirst and pant after the utter Ruine of those <hi>States;</hi> Having in contempt almost the <hi>German Nation,</hi> and doubting little oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, except it come from <hi>England:</hi> Whereby either we must suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the <hi>Dutch</hi> to be ruined, to our own manifest prejudice; Or put it upon the hazard, I spake of before, that <hi>Spain</hi> will cast at the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest. Neither is the point of <hi>Internal Danger,</hi> which groweth upon us, to be forgotten; This; That the Party of the <hi>Papists</hi> in <hi>England</hi> are become more knotted, both in Dependance towards <hi>Spain,</hi> and amongst themselves, than they have been. Wherein again comes to be remembred the Case of 88. For then also it appeared by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers secret Letters, that the Design of <hi>Spain</hi> was, (for some years before the Invasion attempted) to prepare a Party in this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> to adhere to the <hi>Foreigner</hi> at his coming. And they bragged, that they doubted not, but to abuse and lay asleep the <hi>Queen</hi> and <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> as to have any fear of the Party of <hi>Papists</hi> here; For that they knew (they said) the <hi>State</hi> would but cast the eye, and look about, to see whether there were any Eminent Head of that Party, under whom it might unite it self; And finding none worth

the thinking on, the <hi>State</hi> would rest secure, and take no appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension; Whereas they meant, (they said) to take a course, to deal with the People, and particulars, by Reconcilements, and Confessions, and Secret Promises, and cared not for any Head of Party. And this was the true reason, why after that the <hi>Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> began to blossom, and to make Missions into <hi>England,</hi> (which was about the three and twentieth year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> at what time also was the first suspition of the <hi>Spanish Invasion</hi>) then, and not before, grew the sharp and severe Laws to be made against the Papists. And therefore the Papists may do well, to change their thanks; And whereas they thank <hi>Spain</hi> for their Favours, to thank them for their Perils and Miseries, if they should fall upon them: For that nothing ever made their Case so ill, as the Doubt of the Greatness of <hi>Spain;</hi> which adding Reason of <hi>State,</hi> to Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Conscience and Religion, did whet the <hi>Laws</hi> against them. And this Case also seemeth (in some sort) to return again at this time; except the Clemency of his <hi>Majesty,</hi> and the <hi>State,</hi> do su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabound: As, for my part, I do wish it should; And that the Proceedings towards them, may rather tend to Security, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and Point of State, than to Persecution for Religion. But to conclude; These Things briefly touched, may serve, as in a Subject Conjectural, and Future, for to represent, how just Cause of <hi>Fear</hi> this <hi>Kingdom</hi> may have towards <hi>Spain:</hi> Omitting (as I said before) all present, and more secret Occurrences.</p>
                  <p>The third Ground of a <hi>War</hi> with <hi>Spain,</hi> I have set down to be; <hi>A Just Fear of the Subversion of our Church and Religion.</hi> Which needeth little Speech: For if this <hi>War</hi> be a <hi>Defensive,</hi> (as I have proved it to be,) no Man will doubt; That a <hi>Defensive War,</hi> against a Foreigner for <hi>Religion,</hi> is lawful. Of an <hi>Offensive War</hi> there is more Dispute: And yet in that instance of the <hi>War</hi> for the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> and <hi>Sepulchre,</hi> I do wonder sometimes, that the <hi>School-Men</hi> want words to defend that, which <hi>St. Bernard</hi> wanted words to commend. But I, that in this little Extract of a Treatise, do omit things necessary, am not to handle things unnecessary. No man, I say, will doubt, but if the <hi>Pope,</hi> or <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> would demand of us to forsake our <hi>Religion,</hi> upon pain of a <hi>War,</hi> it were as unjust a Demand, as the <hi>Persians</hi> made to the <hi>Grecians</hi> of <hi>Land</hi> and <hi>Water;</hi> Or the <hi>Ammonites</hi> to the <hi>Israelites</hi> of their <hi>Right Eyes.</hi> And we see all the <hi>Heathen</hi> did stile their <hi>Defensive Wars, Pro Aris &amp; Focis;</hi> Placing their Altars before their Hearths. So that it is in vain of this to speak further. Onely this is true; That the <hi>Fear</hi> of the <hi>Subversion</hi> of our <hi>Religion</hi> from <hi>Spain,</hi> is the more just, for that all other <hi>Catholick Princes</hi> and <hi>States,</hi> content and contain themselves, to maintain their <hi>Religion</hi> within their own Dominions, and meddle not with the Subjects of other <hi>States;</hi> Whereas the Practice of <hi>Spain</hi> hath been, both in <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth's time, and in the time of the <hi>League</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> by <hi>War;</hi> And now with us, by Conditions of Treaty, to intermeddle with <hi>Foreign States,</hi> and to declare themselves Protectors General, of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64460:8"/>
the Party of <hi>Catholicks,</hi> through the World. As if the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> had a little of this; That they would plant the <hi>Popes Laws</hi> by <hi>Arms,</hi> as the <hi>Ottomans</hi> do the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> Thus much concerning the first main Point of <hi>Justifying the Quarrel;</hi> if the <hi>King</hi> shall enter into a <hi>War;</hi> For this that I have said, and all that followeth to be said, is but to shew what he may do.</p>
                  <p>The Second main Part, of that I have propounded to speak of, is the <hi>Ballance of Forces between</hi> Spain <hi>and us.</hi> And this also tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to no more, but what the <hi>King</hi> may do. For <hi>what he may do, s</hi> of two kindes: What he may do as <hi>Just;</hi> And what he may do as <hi>Possible.</hi> Of the one I have already spoken; Of the other I am now to speak. I said, <hi>Spain</hi> was no such <hi>Giant;</hi> And yet if he were a <hi>Giant,</hi> it will be, but as it was between <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Goliah;</hi> for <hi>God is on our side.</hi> But to leave all Arguments that are Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, and to speak in an Humane and Politick Sense; I am led to think that <hi>Spain</hi> is no Over-match for <hi>England,</hi> by that which leadeth all Men; That is, <hi>Experience,</hi> and <hi>Reason.</hi> And with <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience</hi> I will begin; For there all <hi>Reason</hi> beginneth.</p>
                  <p>Is it Fortune, (shall we think,) that in all Actions of <hi>War</hi> or Arms, great and small, which have happened these many years, ever since <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>England</hi> have had any thing to debate one with the other, the <hi>English,</hi> upon all Encounters, have perpetually come off with honour, and the better? It is not fortune sure; She is not so constant. There is somewhat in the <hi>Nation,</hi> and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Courage of the People, or some such thing. I will make a brief List of the Particulars themselves, in an Historical Truth, no ways strowted, nor made greater by Language. This were a fit Speech, (you will say,) for a <hi>General,</hi> in the Head of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, when they wére going to Battel; Yes; And it is no less fit Speech, to be spoken in the Head of a Council, upon a Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Entrance into a <hi>War.</hi> Neither speak I this to disparage the <hi>Spanish Nation,</hi> whom I take to be of the best Soldiers in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi> But that forteth to our honour, if we still have had the better hand.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1578. was that famous <hi>Lammas Day,</hi> which buried the Reputation of <hi>Don Ihuan d' Austria,</hi> himself not surviving long after. <hi>Don Ihuan,</hi> being superiour in Forces, assisted by the Prince of <hi>Parma, Mondragon, Mansell,</hi> and other the best Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of <hi>Spain,</hi> confident of Victory, charged the Army of the <hi>States</hi> near <hi>Rimenant,</hi> bravely and furiously at the first; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Fight maintained by the space of a whole day, was repulsed and forced to a Retreat, with great slaughter of his men, and the Course of his further Enterprizes was wholly arrested; And this chiefly by the Prowess and Vertue of the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scottish</hi> Troops, under the Conduct of Sir <hi>John Norris,</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert Stuart,</hi> Colonels. Which Troops came to the Army but the day before, harrased with a long and wearisom march; and (as it is left for a Memorable Circumstance in all Stories,) the Sculdiers, being more sensible of a little Heat of the Sun, than any cold
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64460:9"/>
Fear of Death, cast away their Armour and Garments from them, and fought in their Shirts: And, as it was generally conceived, had it not been that the Count of <hi>Bossu</hi> was slack in charging the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> upon their Retreat, this Fight had sorted to an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Defeat. But it was enough to chastise <hi>Don Ihuan,</hi> for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidious Treaty of Peace, wherewith he had abused the <hi>States</hi> at his first coming. And the Fortune of the day, (besides the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of all Stories), may be the better ascribed to the Service of the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scottish,</hi> by comparison of this Charge near <hi>Rimenant,</hi> (where the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scottish,</hi> in great numbers came in action,) with the like Charge given by <hi>Don Ihuan,</hi> half a year before at <hi>Glembours,</hi> where the Success was contrary; There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at that time in the Army, but a Handful of <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scottish,</hi> and they put in disarray by the Horsemen, of their own Fellows.</p>
                  <p>The first Dart of War which was thrown from <hi>Spain,</hi> or <hi>Rome,</hi> upon the Realm of <hi>Ireland,</hi> was in the year 1380. For the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of <hi>Stukeley</hi> blew over into <hi>Africk;</hi> And the Attempt of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and <hi>Fitz Maurice,</hi> had a spice of Madness.

                     </hi> use; For their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign was no less: But withal they brought Arms for five thousand men above their own Company, intending to arm so many of the <hi>Rebels</hi> of <hi>Ireland:</hi> And their purpose was to fortifie in some strong Place of the wilde and desolate Countrey, and there to nestle till greater Succours came; They being hastened unto this Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise, upon a special Reason of State, not proper to the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise it self; Which was, by the Invasion of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the noise thereof, to trouble the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and to make a diversion of certain Aids that then were preparing from hence for the <hi>Low-Countreys.</hi> They chose a place, where they erected a Fort, which they called <hi>The Fort del Or;</hi> And from thence they bolted like Beasts of the Forest, sometimes into the Woods and Fastnesses, and sometimes back again to their Den. Soon after Siege was laid to the Fort, by the Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> then Deputy, with a smaller num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber than those were within the Fort; Venturously indeed; But haste was made to attache them before the <hi>Rebels</hi> came in to them. After the siege of four days oneiy, and two or three Sallies, with loss on their part, they that should have made good the Fort for some moneths, till new Succours came from <hi>Spain,</hi> or at least from the Rebels of <hi>Ireland,</hi> yielded up themselves without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, at the end of those four days. And for that there were not in the <hi>English</hi> Army enough to keep every man a Prisoner; And for that also the <hi>Deputy</hi> expected instantly to be assailed by the Rebels; And again, there were no Barques to throw them into, and send them away by Sea, they were all put to the sword; With which Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was afterwards much displeased.</p>

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64460:9"/>
For in the true judgement of Men of <hi>War,</hi> Honourable Retreats are no ways inferior to brave Charges; As having less of Fortune, more of Discipline, and as much of Valour. There were to the number of three hundred Horse, and as many thousand Foot <hi>English,</hi> (Commanded by Sir <hi>John Norris,</hi>) charged by the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> coming upon them with seven thousand Horse; Besides that, the whole Army of <hi>Spaniards</hi> was ready to march on. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless Sir <hi>John Norris</hi> maintained a Retreat without Disarray, by the space of some miles, (part of the way Champagne) unto the City of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> with less loss of Men than the Enemy: The <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Anjou,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Aurange,</hi> beholding this noble Action from the Walls of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> as in a Theatre, with great Admiration.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1585. followed the Prosperous <hi>Expedition</hi> of <hi>Drake,</hi> and <hi>Carlile,</hi> into the <hi>West-Indies.</hi> In the which, I set aside the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of St. <hi>Jago,</hi> and St. <hi>Domingo</hi> in <hi>Hispaniola,</hi> as Surprizes, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Encounters. But that of <hi>Cartagena,</hi> where the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had warning of our coming, and had put themselves in their full strength, was one of the hottest Services, and most dangerous As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults, that hath been known. For the Access to the Town, was onely by a Neck of Land, between the Sea on the one part, and the Harbour Water, or Inner Sea, on the other; Fortified clean over with a strong Rampier and Barracado; So as upon the Ascent of our Men, they had both great Ordnance and small Shot, that thundred and showred upon them, from the Rampier in front, and from the Galleys that lay at Sea in flank. And yet they forced the Passage, and wan the Town, being likewise very well man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. As for the <hi>Expedition</hi> of Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> in the year 1587. for the destroying of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Shipping, and Provision upon their own Coast; As I cannot say, that there intervened in that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, any sharp Fight or Encounter; So nevertheless, it did strangely discover, either that <hi>Spain</hi> is very weak at home, or very slow to move; When they suffered a small Fleet of <hi>English</hi> to make an hostile Invasion, or Incursion, upon their Havens and Roads, from <hi>Cadez</hi> to <hi>Capa Sacra,</hi> and thence to <hi>Cascais;</hi> And to fire, sink, and carry away, at the least, ten thousand Tun of their great Shipping, besides fifty or sixty of their smaller Vessels: And that in the sight, and under the favour of their <hi>Forts;</hi> And almost under the Eye of their great <hi>Admiral,</hi> (the best <hi>Commander</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> by Sea,) the Marquis <hi>De Sancta Cruz,</hi> without ever being disputed with by any fight of importance. I remember <hi>Drake,</hi> in the vaunting stile of a Souldier, would call this Enterprize, <hi>The Cingeing of the King of</hi> Spains <hi>Beard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Enterprize of <hi>Eighty Eight</hi> deserveth to be stood upon a little more fully, being a Miracle of Time. There armed from <hi>Spain</hi> in the year 1588. the greatest <hi>Navy</hi> that ever swam upon the Sea. For though there have been far greater Fleets for number, yet for the Bulk and Building of the Ships, with the Furniture of great Ordnance and Provisions, never the like. The Design was to make, not an Invasion onely, but an utter Conquest of this Kingdom. The number of Vessels were one hundred and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64460:10"/>
thirty, whereof Galliasses and Gallions seventy two, goodly Ships like floating Towers, or Castles, manned with Thirty thousand Souldiers and Mariners. This <hi>Navy</hi> was the Preparation of five whole years at the least. It bare it self also upon Divine Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; For it received special Blessing from Pope <hi>Zistus,</hi> and was assigned as an <hi>Apostolical Mission,</hi> for the Reducement of this <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> to the obedience of the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> And in further token of this holy Warfare, there were amongst the rest of these Ships, Twelve, called by the name of the <hi>Twelve Apostles.</hi> But it was truely conceived, that this Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> could never be over-whelmed, except the Land-Waters came in to the Sea-Tides. Therefore was there also in readiness, in <hi>Flanders,</hi> a mighty strong Army of Land-Forces, to the number of Fifty thousand veterane Souldiers, under the Conduct of the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> the best Commander, next the French King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, of his time. These were designed to joyn with the Forces at Sea; There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prepared a number of Flat-bottom'd Boats, to transport the Land Forces, under the Wing and Protection of the Great <hi>Navy.</hi> For they made no account, but that the <hi>Navy</hi> should be absolute Master of the Seas. Against these Forces, there were prepared, on our part, to the number of near one hundred Ships; Not so great of Bulk indeed, but of a more nimble Motion, and more serviceable; Besides a less Fleet of 30 Ships, for the Custody of the Narrow Seas. There were also in readiness at Land, two Armies, besides other Forces, to the number of Ten thousand, dispersed amongst the Coast Towns, in the Southern Parts. The two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were appointed; One of them consisting of Twenty five thousand Horse and Foot, for the Repulsing of the Enemy, at their landing; And the other of Twenty five thousand for safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard and attendance about the Court, and the Queens Person. There were also other Dormant Musters of Souldiers, throughout all Parts of the Realm, that were put in readiness, but not drawn together. The two Armies were assigned to the Leading of two Generals, Noble Persons, but both of them rather Courtiers, and Assured to the State, than Martial Men; yet lined and assisted with Subordinate Commanders, of great Experience &amp; Valor. The Fortune of the <hi>War</hi> made this Enterprize, at first, a Play at <hi>Base.</hi> The <hi>Spanish Navy</hi> set forth out of the <hi>Groyne</hi> in <hi>May,</hi> was disperst and driven back by Weather. Our <hi>Navy</hi> set forth somewhat later out of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> and bare up towards the Coast of <hi>Spain,</hi> to have fought with the <hi>Spanish Navy;</hi> And partly by reason of contrary Winds, partly upon advertisement that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were gone back, and upon some doubt also that they might pass towards the Coast of <hi>England,</hi> whilest we were seeking them afar off, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned likewise into <hi>Plimouth,</hi> about the middle of <hi>July.</hi> At that time, came more confident Advertisement, (though false,) not onely to the Lord <hi>Admiral,</hi> but to the <hi>Court,</hi> that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> could not possibly come forward that year; Whereupon our <hi>Navy</hi> was upon the point of Disbanding, and many of our Men gone ashore. At which very time, the <hi>Invincible Armada,</hi> (for so it was
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64460:10"/>
called in a <hi>Spanish</hi> Ostentation throughout <hi>Europe</hi>) was discovered upon the Western Coast. It was a kinde of Surprize; For that (as was said) many of our men were gone to Land, and our Ships ready to depart. Nevertheless the Admiral, with such Ships only as could suddenly be put in readiness, made forth towards them: In so much as of one hundred Ships, there came scarce thirty to work. Howbeit with them, and such as came dayly in, we set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and gave them the chase. But the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> for want of Courage, (which they called <hi>Commission</hi>) declined the Fight, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting themselves continually into Roundels, (their strongest Ships walling in the rest,) and in that manner they made a flying march towards <hi>Callis.</hi> Our Men, by the space of five or six days, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them close, fought with them continually, made great slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their Men, took two of their great Ships, and gave divers others of their Ships their Deaths wounds, whereof soon after they sank and perished; And (in a word) distressed them almost in the nature of a Defeat; We our selves, in the mean time, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving little or no hurt. Near <hi>Callis</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> anchored, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting their Land-Forces, which came not. It was afterwards al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> did artificially delay his Coming. But this was but an Invention and Pretension given out by the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> Partly upon a <hi>Spanish</hi> Envy against that Duke, being an <hi>Italian,</hi> and his Son a Competitor to <hi>Portugal;</hi> But chiefly, to save the Monstrous Scorn and Disreputation, which they and their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion received, by the Success of that Enterprize. Therefore their Colours and Excuses (forsooth) were, that their General by Sea had a limitted Commission, not to fight until the Land-Forces were come in to them: And that the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> had particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Reaches, and Ends of his own, underhand, to cross the Design. But it was both a strange Commission, and a strange Obedience to a Commission, for Men in the midst of their own blood, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so furiously assailed, to hold their hands, contrary to the Laws of Nature and Necessity. And as for the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> he was reasonably well tempted to be true to that Enterprize, by no less Promise, than to be made a Feudatary, or Beneficiary <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> under the Seignorie (in chief) of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> Besides it appeared, that the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> held his place long after, in the Favour and Trust of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> by the great Employments and Services that he performed in <hi>France:</hi> And again, it is manifest, that the Duke did his best to come down, and to put to Sea: The Truth was, that the <hi>Spanish Navy,</hi> upon those proofs of Fight which they had with the <hi>English,</hi> finding how much hurt they received, and how little hurt they did, by reason of the Activity and low building of our Ships, and skill of our Sea-men; And being also commanded by a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of small Courage and Experience; And having lost, at the first, two of their bravest Commanders at Sea, <hi>Petro de Valdez,</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael de Oquenda;</hi> durst not put it to a Battel at Sea, but set up their rest wholly upon the Land-Enterprize. On the other side, the Transporting of the Land-forces failed in the very foundation. For
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64460:11"/>
whereas the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> made full account, that their <hi>Navy</hi> should be Master of the Sea, and therefore able to guard and protect the Vessels of Transportation; When it fell out to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that the Great <hi>Navy</hi> was distressed, and had enough to do to save it self; And again, that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> impounded their Land-forces with a brave Fleet of thirty Sayl, excellently well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; Things (I say) being in this state, it came to pass, that the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> must have flown, if he would have come into <hi>England,</hi> for he could get neither Barqne nor Mariner to put to Sea: Yet certain it is, that the Duke looked still for the coming back of the <hi>Armada,</hi> even at that time, when they were wandring, and making their Perambulation upon the Northern Seas. But to return to the <hi>Armada,</hi> which we left anchored at <hi>Callis.</hi> From thence, (as Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> was wont prettily to say) <hi>they were suddenly driven away with Squibs;</hi> For it was no more but a Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem of Fire-boats, Manless, and sent upon them by the favour of the Wind, in the night time, that did put them in such terrour, as they cut their Cables, and left their Anchors at Sea. After they hovered some two or three days about <hi>Graveling,</hi> and there again were beaten in a great Fight, at what time our second Fleet, which kept the Narrow Seas, was come in and joy ned to our main Fleet. Thereupon the <hi>Spaniards</hi> entring into further terrour, and sinding also divers of their Ships every day to sink, lost all courage, and in stead of coming up into the <hi>Thames Mouth</hi> for <hi>London,</hi> (as their Design was) fled on towards the <hi>North,</hi> to seek their Fortunes; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing still chaced by the <hi>English Navy</hi> at the heels, until we were fain to give them over for want of Powder. The Breath of <hi>Scotland</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> could not endure; Neither durst they as Invaders land in <hi>Ireland;</hi> But onely ennobled some of the Coasts thereof with shipwracks. And so going North wards aloof, as long as they had any doubt of being pursued, at last when they were out of reach, they turned, and crossed the Ocean to <hi>Spain,</hi> having lost fourscore of their Ships, and the greater part of their Men. And this was the End of that <hi>Sea-Giant,</hi> the <hi>Invincible Armada.</hi> Which having not so much as fired a Cottage of ours at Land, nor taken a Cock-boat of ours at Sea, wandred through the Wilderness of the Northern Seas; And according to the Curse in the Scripture; <hi>Came out against us one way, and fled before us seven ways.</hi> Serving onely to make good the judgement of an Astrologer, long before given; <hi>Octuagesimus Octavus Mirabilis Annus;</hi> Or rather, to make good, (even to the astonishment of all Posterity) the wonderful Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God poured down, commonly, upon vast and proud Aspirings.</p>
                  <p>In the year, that followed, of 1589. we gave the <hi>Spaniards</hi> no breath, but turned Challengers, and invaded the Main of <hi>Spain.</hi> In which Enterprize, although we failed in our End, which was to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>Don Antonio</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal,</hi> yet a man shall hardly meet with an Action, that doth better reveal the great Secret of the Power of <hi>Spain:</hi> Which Power, well sought into, will be found rather to consist in a Veterane Army, (such as upon several Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions

and Pretensions, they have ever had on foot, in one part or other of <hi>Christendom,</hi> now the space of (almost) sixscore years,) than in the strength of their Dominions and Provinces. For what can be more strange, or more to the Dis-valuation of the Power of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> upon the Continent, than that with an Army of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thousand <hi>English,</hi> Land-Souldiers, and a Fleet of Twenty six Ships of War, besides some weak Vessels for Transportation, we should within the Hour-glass of two Moneths have won one Town of importance by <hi>Escalada;</hi> Battered and Assaulted another; Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown great Forces in the Field, and that upon the disadvantage of a Bridge strongly barracado'd, Landed the Army in three seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places of his Kingdom; Marched seven days in the Heart of his Countreys; Lodged three nights in the Suburbs of his principal City; Beaten his Forces into the Gates thereof; Possessed two of his Frentire Forts; And come off, after all this, with small loss of Men, otherwise than by Sickness. And it was verily thought, that had it not been for four great Disfavours of that Voyage; (That is to say; The failing in sundry Provisions that were promised, especially of Cannons for Battery; The vain Hopes of <hi>Don Antomo</hi> concerning the People of the Countrey, to come in to his aid; The Disappointment of the Fleet that was directed to come up the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Lisbon;</hi> And lastly, the Diseases which spred in the Army, by reason of the Heat of the Season, and of the Souldiers Misrule in Diet;) the Enterprize had succeeded, and <hi>Lisbon</hi> had been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. But howsoever, it makes proof to the World, that an Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of a few <hi>English</hi> upon <hi>Spain,</hi> may have just hope of Victory, at least of Pasport to depart safely.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1591. was that Memorable Fight, of an <hi>English Ship</hi> called <hi>The Revenge,</hi> under the Command of Sir <hi>Richard Greenvil;</hi> Memorable (I say) even beyond credit, and to the Height of some Herorcal Fable. And though it were a Defeat, yet it exceeded a Victory; being like the Act of <hi>Sampson,</hi> that killed more Men at his Death, than he had done in the time of all his Life. This <hi>Ship</hi> for the space of fifteen hours, sate like a Stag amongst Hounds, at the bay, and was seiged, and fought with, in turn, by fifteen great Ships of <hi>Spain;</hi> part of a Navy of Fifty five Ships in all; The rest like Abettors looking on afar off. And amongst the fifteen Ships that fought, the great St. <hi>Philippo</hi> was one, a Ship of fifteen hundred Tun; Prince of the twelve <hi>Sea Apostles,</hi> which was right glad, when she was shifted off from the <hi>Revenge.</hi> This brave Ship the <hi>Revenge,</hi> being Manned onely with two hundred (Souldiers and Mariners,) whereof eighty lay sick, yet nevertheless after a Fight maintained (as was said) of fifteen hours, and two Ships of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my sunk by her side; Besides many more torn and battered, and great slaughter of men, never came to be entred, but was taken by Composition; The Enemies themselves having in admiration the Vertue of the Commander, and the whole Tragedy of that Ship.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1596. was the Second <hi>Invasion,</hi> that we made upon the Main Territories of <hi>Spain,</hi> prosperously atchiev'd by that Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and Famous, <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> in consort with the Noble
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64460:12"/>
Earl of <hi>Notingham,</hi> that now liveth, then <hi>Admiral.</hi> This Journey was like Lightning; For in the space of fourteen hours, the King of <hi>Spains Navy</hi> was destroyed, and the Town of <hi>Cadez</hi> taken. The <hi>Navy</hi> was no less than fifty tall Ships, besides twenty Gallies to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them. The Ships were straightways beaten, and put to flight. with such terrour, a the <hi>Spainards,</hi> in the end, were their own Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners, and fired them all with their own hands. The Gallies, by the benefit of the Shores and Shallows, got away. The Town was a fair, strong, well built, and rich City; Famous in Antiquity, and now most spoken of for this Disaster. It was mann'd with 4000 Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers Foot, and some 400 Horse; It was sacked, and burned, though great Clemency was used towards the Inhabitants. But that which is no less strange than the sudden Victory, is the great patience of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> Who, though we staid upon the place divers days, yet never offered us any play then, nor ever put us in suit, by any Action of Revenge, or Reparation, at any time after.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1600, was the Battel of <hi>Newport</hi> in the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> where the Armies of the <hi>Arch-Duke,</hi> and the <hi>States,</hi> tried it out by a just Battell. This was the only Battell, that was fought in those Countries, these many years. For Battels in the <hi>French Wars</hi> have been frequent; But in the <hi>Wars</hi> of <hi>Flanders,</hi> rare, as the Nature of a Defensive requireth. The Forces of both Armies were not much unequal: That of the <hi>States</hi> exceeded somewhat in number; but that again was recompensed in the quality of the Souldiers; For those of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Part were of the Flower of all the Forces. The <hi>Arch Duke</hi> was the Assailant, and the Preventer, and had the fruit of his Diligence and Celerity. For he had charged certain Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of <hi>Scottishmen,</hi> to the number of eight hundred, sent to make good a Passage, and thereby severed from the Body of the Army, and cut them all in pieces: For they like a brave Infantry, when they could make no honorable Retreat, and would take no disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Flight, made good the place with their Lives. This Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Battel did whet the Courage of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> though it dulled their Swords; so as they came proudly on, confident to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat the whole Army. The Encounter of the Main Battel, which followed, was a just Encounter, not hastening to a sudden Rout, nor the Fortune of the day resting upon a few former Ranks, but fought out to the proof by several Squadrons, and not without va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of success; <hi>Stat pedi pes, densusque viro vir.</hi> There fell out an Errour in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Army, by the over-hasty Medly of some of their Men, with the Enemies, which hindred the playing of their great Ordnance. But the End was, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were utterly defeated, and near five thousand of their Men, in the Fight, and in the Execution, slain, and taken; Amongst whom were many of the principal Persons of their Army. The Honour of the Day was, both by the Enemy, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> themselves, ascribed unto the <hi>English;</hi> Of whom Sir <hi>Francis Vere,</hi> in a private <hi>Commentary,</hi> which he wrote of that Service, leaveth testified; That of fifteen hundred in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, (for they were no more) eight hundred were slain in the field; And (which is almost incredible in a day of Victory,) of the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64460:12"/>
seven hundred, two onely Men came off unhurt. Amongst the rest Sir <hi>Francis Vere</hi> himself had the principal honour of the Service, unto whom the Prince of <hi>Aurange</hi> (as is said) did transmit the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Army for that day. And in the next place, Sir <hi>Horace Vere</hi> his Brother, that now liveth, who was the principal in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive part. The Service also, of Sir <hi>Edward Cecill,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Ogle,</hi> and divers other brave Gentlemen, was eminent.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1601. followed the Battel of <hi>Kinsale</hi> in <hi>Ireland.</hi> By this <hi>Spanish Invasion</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> (which was in <hi>September</hi> that year) a Man may guess, how long time a <hi>Spaniard</hi> will live in <hi>Irish</hi> ground; which is a matter of a quarter of a year, or four moneths at most. For they had all the Advantages in the world; And no man would have thought, (considering the small Forces imployed against them) that they could have been driven out so soon. They obtained, without resistance, in the end of <hi>September,</hi> the Town of <hi>Kinsale;</hi> A small Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of 150 <hi>English,</hi> leaving the Town upon the <hi>Spaniards</hi> approach, and the Townsmen receiving the <hi>Foreiners</hi> as friends. The number of <hi>Spaniards</hi> that put themselves into <hi>Kinsale,</hi> was 2000 men, Soldiers of old Bands, under the command of <hi>Don Ihuan d'Aquila,</hi> a man of good valour. The Town was strong of it self; neither wanted there any Industry to fortifie it on all parts, and make it tenable, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Skill and Discipline of <hi>Spanish</hi> Fortification. At that time the <hi>Rebels</hi> were proud, being encouraged upon former Successes; For though the then Deputy, the Lord <hi>Mountjoy,</hi> and Sir <hi>George Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rew,</hi> President of <hi>Munster,</hi> had performed divers good Services to their prejudice; Yet the Defeat they had given the <hi>English</hi> at <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water,</hi> not long before; And their Treaty (too muth to their honor) with the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> was yet fresh in their memory. The <hi>Deputy</hi> lost no time, but made haste to have recovered the Town, before new Succors came, and sate down before it in <hi>October,</hi> and laid siege to it by the space of three Winter Months, or more: During which time, Sallies were made by the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> but they were beaten in with loss. In <hi>January</hi> came fresh Succors from <hi>Spain,</hi> to the number of 2000. more, under the Conduct of <hi>Alonzo d'Ocampo.</hi> Upon the Comforts of these Succors, <hi>Tirone</hi> and <hi>Odonnel,</hi> drew up their Forces together, to the number of 7000. besides the <hi>Spanish</hi> Regiments, and took the field, resolved to rescue the Town, and give the <hi>English</hi> Battel. So here was the Case: An Army of <hi>English,</hi> of some 6000, wasted and tired with a long Winters Siege, engaged in the middest between an Army of a greater number than themselves, fresh and in vigor, on the one side; and a Town strong in fortification, and strong in Men, on the other. But what was the Event? Thus in few words; That after the <hi>Irish</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> Forces had come on, and shewed themselves in some Bravery, they were content to give the <hi>English</hi> the honor, as to charge them first; And when it came to the Charge, there appeared no other difference between the Valour of the <hi>Irish Rebels,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but that the one ran away before they were charged, and the other straight after. And again, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that were in the Town, had so good Memories of their Losses, in their former Sallies, as the Confidence of an Army, which came for their
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64460:13"/>
deliverance, could not draw them forth again. To conclude, there succeeded an absolute Victory for the <hi>English,</hi> with the slaughter of above 2000 of the Enemy; The taking of nine Ensigns, whereof six <hi>Spanish;</hi> the taking of the <hi>Spanish</hi> General, <hi>D'Ocampo,</hi> Prisoner; And this with the loss of so few of the <hi>English,</hi> as is scarce credible; Being (as hath been rather confidently, than credibly reported) but of one Man, the Cornet of Sir <hi>Richard Gream,</hi> though not a few hurt. There followed immediate y after the Defeat, a present yielding up of the Town by Composition; And not onely so, but an Avoiding (by express Articles of Treaty accorded) of all other <hi>Spanish</hi> Forces tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowout all <hi>Ireland,</hi> from the Plaees and Nests where they had setled themselves, in greater strength (as in regard of the natural Situation of the Places) than that was of <hi>Kinsale:</hi> Which were, <hi>Castle haven, Baltimore,</hi> and <hi>Beere-haven.</hi> Indeed they went away with sound of Trumpet; For they did nothing but publish and trumpet all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches they could devise against the Irish Land and Nation; Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as <hi>D'Aquila</hi> said in open Treaty; <hi>That when the Devil, upon the Mount, did shew Christ all the Kingdoms of the Earth, and the Glory of them, he did not doubt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </p>
                  <p>I cease here, omitting not a few other proofs of the <hi>English</hi> Valor and Fortune. in their later times: As at the Suburbs of <hi>Paris,</hi> at the <hi>Raveline,</hi> at <hi>Druse</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> some Encounters in <hi>Britanny,</hi> and at <hi>Ostend,</hi> and divers others; Partly because some of them have not been proper Encounters between the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the <hi>English,</hi> and partly because others of them have not been of that greatness, as to have sorted in company with the Particulars formerly recited. It is true, that amongst all the late Adventures, the Voyage of Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Hawkins,</hi> into the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> was unfortunate; Yet in such sort, as it doth not break or interrupt our Prescription; To have had the better of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> upon all Fights of late. For the Disaster of that Journey was caused chiefly by sickness; As might well appear by the Deaths of both the Generals, (Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Hawkins</hi>) of the same sickness amongst the rest. The Land-Enterprise of <hi>Panama,</hi> was an ill measured and immature Counsel; for it was grounded upon a false account, that the Passages towards <hi>Panama</hi> were no better fortified, than <hi>Drake</hi> had left them. But yet, it sorted not to any Fight of importance, but to a Retreat, after the <hi>English</hi> had proved the strength of their first Fort, and had notice of the two other Forts beyond, by which they were to have marched. It is true, that in the Return of the <hi>English</hi> Fleet, they were set upon by <hi>Avellaneda,</hi> Admiral of 20 great great ships <hi>Spanish,</hi> our Fleet being but 14, full of sick men, deprived of their two Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals at Sea, and having no pretence but to journey homewards: And yet the <hi>Spaniards</hi> did but salute them about the <hi>Cape de los Corientes,</hi> with some small offer of Fight, and came off with loss; Although it was such a new thing for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to receive so little hurt up on dealing with the <hi>English,</hi> as <hi>Avellaneda</hi> made great brags of it, for no greater matter, than the waiting upon the <hi>English</hi> a far off, from <hi>Cape de los Corientes</hi> to <hi>Cape Antonio;</hi> Which nevertheless, in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of a Souldier, and of a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> he called a <hi>Chace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:64460:13"/>
                  <p>But before I proceed further, it is good to meet with an Objection, which if it be not removed, the Conclusion of <hi>Experience,</hi> from the time past, to the time present, will not be sound and perfect. For it will be said, that in the former times (whereof we have spoken) <hi>Spain</hi> was not so mighty as now it is; And <hi>England</hi> on the other side, was more afore-hand in all matters of Power. Therefore let us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with indifferency, these Disparities of times, and we shall plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceive, that they make for the advantage of <hi>England</hi> at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent time. And because we will less wander in Generalities, we will fix the Comparison to precise Times; Comparing the State of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>England</hi> in the year 88. with this present year that now run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth. In handling of this Point, I will not meddle with any Person<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Comparisons, of the <hi>Princes, Councellors,</hi> and <hi>Commanders</hi> by Sea or Land, that were then, and that are now, in both Kingdoms, <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>England;</hi> but onely rest upon Real Points, for the true Ballancing of the <hi>State,</hi> of the <hi>Forces,</hi> and <hi>Affairs</hi> of both Times. And yet these Personal Comparisons I omit not, but that I could evidently shew, that even in these Personal Respects, the Ballance sways on our part: But because I would say nothing that may favour of a spirit of Flattery, or Censure, of the present Government.</p>
                  <p>First therefore, it is certain, that <hi>Spain</hi> hath not now a foot of Ground in quiet possession, more than it had in 88. As for the <hi>Valto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line,</hi> and the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> it is a Maxim in State, that all Countreys of new Acquest, till they be setled, are rather matters of Burthen, than Strength. On the other side, <hi>England</hi> hath <hi>Scotland</hi> united, &amp; <hi>Ireland</hi> reduc'd to obedience, and planted, which are mighty augmentations.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in 88. the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> able alone to counterpoize <hi>Spain</hi> it self, (much more in conjunction) was torn with the Party of the League, which gave Law to their King, and depended wholly upon <hi>Spain.</hi> Now <hi>France</hi> is united under a valiant young King, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally obeyed, if he will himself; King of <hi>Navarre</hi> as well as of <hi>France;</hi> And that is no ways taken Prisoner, though he be tyed in a double chain of Alliance, with <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in 88. there sate in the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> a fierce thundering Fryer, that would set all at six and seven; Or at six and five, if you allude to his Name. And though he would after have turned his teeth upon <hi>Spain,</hi> yet he was taken order with before it came to that. Now there is ascended to the Papacy, a Personage that came in by a chaste Election, no ways obliged to the Party of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> A man bred in Embassages and Affairs of State; That hath much of the Prince, and nothing of the Fryer; And one, that though he love the Chair of the Papacy well, yet he loveth the Carpet above the Chair; That is, <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Liberties thereof, well likewise.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, in 88. the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> was a stranger to <hi>England,</hi> and rather inclined to <hi>Spain;</hi> Now the King is incorporated to the Blood of <hi>England,</hi> &amp; Engaged in the Quarrel of the <hi>Palatinate.</hi> Then also <hi>Venice, Savoy,</hi> and the <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Cities</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> had but a dull Fear of the Greatness of <hi>Spain,</hi> upon a general Apprehension onely of the spreading and ambitious Designs of that <hi>Nation:</hi> Now that fear is sharpned and pointed, by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> late Enterprises, upon the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64460:14"/>
                     <hi>Valtoline,</hi> and the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> which come nearer them.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly and lastly, the <hi>Dutch</hi> (which is the <hi>Spaniards</hi> perpetual Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ellist) hath now, at this present, five Ships to one, and the like Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion in Treasure and Wealth, to that they had in 88. Neither is it possible (whatsoever is given out) that the Coffers of <hi>Spain</hi> should now be fuller, than they were in 88. For at that time <hi>Spain</hi> had no other Wars save those of the <hi>Low Countreys,</hi> which were grown into an Ordinary: Now they have had coupled therewith, the Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> and the <hi>Palatinate.</hi> And so I conclude my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the Objection raised, touching the Difference of times; Not entring into more secret passages of State; But keeping that Charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Stile, whereof <hi>Seneca</hi> speaketh, <hi>Plus significat quam loquitur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here I would pass over from Matter of <hi>Experience,</hi> were it not that I held it necessary, to discover a wonderful Erroneous observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that walketh about, and is commonly received, contrary to all the Account of Time, and Experience. It is, that the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> where he once getteth in, will seldom (or never) be got out again. But no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is less true than this. Not long since they got footing at <hi>Brest,</hi> and some other parts in <hi>French Britain,</hi> and after quitted them. They had <hi>Calais, Ardes,</hi> and <hi>Amiens,</hi> and rendred them, or were beaten out. They had since <hi>Verseilles,</hi> &amp; fairly left it. They had the other day the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> and now have put it in deposite. What they will do with <hi>Ormus,</hi> which the <hi>Persian</hi> hath taken from them, we shall see. So that to speak truly of later Times, they have rather poched and offered at a Number of Enterprizes, than maintained any constantly, quite contrary to that idle Tradition. In more antient times (leaving their Purchases in <hi>Africk,</hi> which they after abandoned,) when their great Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> had clasped <hi>Germany,</hi> (almost) in his fist, he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the end, to go from <hi>Isburg,</hi> (and as if it had been in a Masque, by Torch-light,) and to quit every foot in <hi>Germany</hi> round that he had gotten; which I doubt not, will be the Hereditary Issue of this late Purchase of the <hi>Palatinate.</hi> And so I conclude the Ground, that I have to think, that <hi>Spain</hi> will be no Over-match to <hi>Great Britain,</hi> if his <hi>Majesty</hi> shal enter into a <hi>War,</hi> out of <hi>Experience, &amp; Records</hi> of time.</p>
                  <p>For Grounds of <hi>Reason</hi> they are many: I will extract the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, and open them briefly, and (as it were) in the Bud. For <hi>Situation,</hi> I pass it over; though it be no small point: <hi>England, Scotland, Ireland,</hi> and our good Confederates the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> lie all in a plump together, not accessible but by Sea, or at least by passing of great Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, which are Natural Fortifications. As for the Dominions of <hi>Spain,</hi> they are so scattered, as it yieldeth great choice of the Scenes of the War, and promiseth slow Succours unto such Part as shall be attempted. There be three main parts of <hi>Military Puissance; Men, Money,</hi> and <hi>Confederates.</hi> For <hi>Men,</hi> there are to be considered, <hi>Valour,</hi> and <hi>Number.</hi> Of <hi>Valour</hi> I speak not: Take it from the Witnesses that have been produced before: Yet the old observation is not untrue; That the <hi>Spaniards Valour</hi> lieth in the Eye of the Looker on; But the <hi>English Valor</hi> lieth about the Souldiers Heart. A <hi>Valor</hi> of Glory, and a <hi>Valor</hi> of Natural Courage, are two things. But let that pass, and let us speak of <hi>Number. Spain</hi> is a Nation thin sown of People; Partly
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64460:14"/>
by reason of the Sterility of the Soil; And partly because their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives are exhausted by so many Employments, in such vast Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as they possess. So that it hath bin accounted a kind of Miracle, to see ten or twelve thousand Native <hi>Spaniards</hi> in an Army. And it is certain, (as we have touched it a little before in passage) that the Secret of the Power of <hi>Spain,</hi> consisteth in a Veterane Army, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of Miscellany Forces of all Nations, which for many years they have had on foot upon one occasion or other: And if there should happen the Misfortune of a Battel, it would be a long work to draw on Supplies. They tell a Tale of a <hi>Spanish Ambassador,</hi> that was brought to see the Treasury of St. <hi>Mark</hi> at <hi>Venice,</hi> and still he lookt down to the ground; And being asked why he so lookt down, said; <hi>He was looking to see whether their Treasure had any Root, (so that if it were spent, it would grow again) as his Masters had.</hi> But howsoever it be of their Treasure, certainly the Forces have scarce any Root; Or at least such a Root, as buddeth forth poorly &amp; slowly. It is true, they have the <hi>Wallons,</hi> who are tall Souldiers; but that is but a Spot of Ground. But on the other side, there is not in the world again, such a Spring and Seminary of brave Militar People, as in <hi>England, Scotland, Ireland,</hi> and the <hi>United Provinces.</hi> So as if <hi>Wars</hi> should mowe them down never so fast, yet they may be suddenly supplyed, and come up again.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Money,</hi> no doubt it is the principal Part of the Greatness of <hi>Spain;</hi> For by that they maintain a Veterane Army; And <hi>Spain</hi> is the onely State of <hi>Europe,</hi> that is a <hi>Money grower.</hi> But in this Part, of all others, is most to be considered, the tick lish and brittle State of the Greatness of <hi>Spain.</hi> Their <hi>Greatness</hi> consisteth in their <hi>Treasure;</hi> their <hi>Treasure</hi> in their <hi>Indies;</hi> And their <hi>Indies</hi> (if it be well weighed) are indeed but an Accession to such, as are Masters by Sea. So as this Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltree whereupon their Greatness turneth, is soon cut in two, by any that shall be stronger than they by Sea. Herein therefore I refer me to the Opinions of all Men (Enemies, or whomsoever) whether that the Maritime Forces of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> be not able to beat the <hi>Spainard</hi> at Sea. For if that be so, the Links of that Chain whereby they hold their Greatness, are dissolved. Now if it be said, that admit the Case of <hi>Spain</hi> be such, as we have made it, yet we ought to descend into our own Case, which we shall finde (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) not to be in State, (for Treasure) to enter into a <hi>War</hi> with <hi>Spain.</hi> To which I answer; I know no such thing; The Mint beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth well; And the Pulses of the Peoples Hearts beat well. But there is another Point that taketh away quite this Objection: For whereas <hi>Wars</hi> are generally Causes of <hi>Poverty,</hi> or Consumption; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary part, the special Nature of this <hi>War</hi> with <hi>Spain,</hi> (if it be made by Sea) is like to be a Lucrative and Restorative <hi>War.</hi> So that, if we go roundly on at the first, the <hi>War</hi> in continuance will find it self. And therefore you must make a great difference between <hi>Hercules</hi> Labors by Land, and <hi>Jasons</hi> Voyage by Sea for the Golden Fleece.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Confederates,</hi> I will not take upon me the knowledge, how the Princes, States, and Councels of <hi>Europe,</hi> at this day, stand affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Spain;</hi> For that trencheth into the secret Occurents of the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64460:15"/>
present Time, wherewith in all this Treatise I have forborn to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. But to speak of that which lieth open and in view: I see much Matter of Quarrel and Jealousie, but little of Amity and Trust to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Spain,</hi> almost in all other Estates. I see <hi>France</hi> is in competition with them, for three noble Portions of their Monarchy; <hi>Navarre, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> and <hi>Millain;</hi> And now freshly in difference with them about the <hi>Valtoline.</hi> I see once in 30 or 40 years cometh a <hi>Pope,</hi> that casteth his eye upon the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> to recover it to the Church: As it was in the minds of <hi>Julius</hi> 2. <hi>Paulus</hi> 4. and <hi>Zistus</hi> 5. As for that great Body of <hi>Germany,</hi> I see they have greater reason to <hi>confederate</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Great Britain,</hi> or <hi>Denmark,</hi> for the liberty of the <hi>Germane Nation,</hi> and for the Expulsion of <hi>Spanish</hi> and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Forces, than they had in the years 1552. and 1553. At which time they contracted a League with <hi>Henry</hi> II. the <hi>French King,</hi> upon the same Articles, against <hi>Charles</hi> V. who had impatronized himself of a great part of <hi>Germany,</hi> through the discord of the <hi>German Princes,</hi> which himself had so wen and fomented, Which League at that time did the Deed, and drave out all the <hi>Spaniards</hi> out of that part of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many;</hi> and re-integrated that <hi>Nation</hi> in their antient Liberty and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. For the <hi>West Indies,</hi> though <hi>Spain</hi> hath had yet not much actual disturbance there, except it have been from <hi>England;</hi> yet nevertheless I see all Princes lay a kind of claim unto them; accounting the Title of <hi>Spain,</hi> but as a Monopoly of those large Countreys, wherein they have, in great part but an Imaginary Possession. For <hi>Africk</hi> upon the <hi>West,</hi> the Moors of <hi>Valentia</hi> expulsed, and their Allies, do yet hang as a Cloud or Storm over <hi>Spain. Gabor</hi> on the <hi>East,</hi> is like an Anniversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Wind, that riseth every year upon the Party of <hi>Austria.</hi> And <hi>Persia</hi> hath entred into Hostolity with <hi>Spain,</hi> and given them the first blow by taking of <hi>Ormus.</hi> It is within every mans observation also, that <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> doth think their State almost on fire, if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> hold the <hi>Valtoline.</hi> That <hi>Savoy</hi> hath learnt by fresh experience, That Alliance with <hi>Spain</hi> is no Security against the Ambition of <hi>Spain;</hi> And that of <hi>Bavaria</hi> hath likewise bin taught, that Merit and Service doth oblige the <hi>Spaniard</hi> but from day to day. Neither do I say, for all this, but that <hi>Spain</hi> may rectifie much of this ill blood, by their particular and cunning Negotiations: But yet there it is in the Body, and may break out, no man knows when, into ill Accidents: but at least it sheweth plainly that which serveth for our purpose; That <hi>Spain</hi> is much desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Assur'd and Confident <hi>Confederates.</hi> And therefore I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Part, with the Speech of a <hi>Councellor</hi> of State, in <hi>Spain,</hi> at this day, which was not without Salt. He said to his Master, the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> that now is, upon occasion: <hi>Sir, I will tell your Majesty thus much for your comfort; Tour Majesty hath but two Enemies; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the one is, All the World; And the other is, Tour own Ministers.</hi> And thus I end the Second Main Part, I propounded to speak of; which was, The <hi>Ballancing</hi> of the <hi>Forces,</hi> between the <hi>Kings Majesty,</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> if a War must follow.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongst Consolations, it is not the least, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to a Mans self, like <hi>Examples</hi> of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity in others. For <hi>Examples</hi> give a quicker Impression, than <hi>Arguments;</hi> And besides they certifie us that, which the <hi>Scripture</hi> also tendreth for satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; <hi>That no new thing is happened unto us.</hi> This they do the better, by how much the <hi>Examples,</hi> are liker in circumstances, to our own Case; And more especially, if they fell upon <hi>Persons,</hi> that are greater, and worthier, than our selves. For as it savoureth of Vanity, to match our selves highly, in our own conceit; So on the otherside, it is a good sound Conclusion, that if our Betters have sustained the like Events, we have the less cause to be grieved.</p>
                  <p>In this kind of Consolation, I have not been wanting to my Self, Though as a <hi>Christian,</hi> I have tasted (through <hi>Gods</hi> great goodness,) of higher Remedies. Having therefore, through the Variety of my Reading, set before me, many
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64460:17"/>
                     <hi>Examples,</hi> both of Ancient and Later Times, my Thoughts (I confess) have chiefly stayed upon three <hi>Particulars,</hi> as the most Eminent, and the most Resembling. All three <hi>Persons,</hi> that had held chief place of Authority in their Countries; All three ruined, not by War, or by any other Disaster, but by Justice, and Sentence, as Delinquents, and Criminals; All three famous Writers, insomuch as the remembrance of their Calamity, is now as to Posterity, but as a little Picture of Night-work, remaining amongst the fair, and excellent Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, of their Acts, and Works. And all three (if that were anything to the matter,) fit <hi>Examples</hi> to quench any Mans Ambition of Rising again; For that they were every one of them restored with great glory, but to their further Ruine and Destruction, ending in a violent Death. The <hi>Men</hi> were, <hi>Demosthenes, Cicero,</hi> and <hi>Seneca;</hi> Persons, that I durst not claim Affinity with, except the Similitude of our Fortunes had contracted it. When I had cast mine Eyes upon these <hi>Examples,</hi> I was carried on further to observe, how they did bear their Fortunes, and principally, how they did employ their Times, being banished, and disabled for Publick Business: To the end, that I might learn by them; And that they might be, as well my Counsellours, as my Comforters. Whereupon I happened to note, how diversly, their Fortunes wrought upon them, especially in that point, at which I did most aim which was the employing of their Times, and Pens. In <hi>Cicero,</hi> I saw, that during his Banishment, (which was almost two years,) he was so softned, and dejected, as he wrote nothing, but a few Womanish <hi>Epistles.</hi> And yet, in mine opinion, he had least reason of the Three, to be discouraged: For that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was judged, and judged by the highest kind of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in form of a <hi>Statute,</hi> or <hi>Law,</hi> that he should be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished; And his whole Estate confiscated, and seized; And his houses pulled down; And that it should be highly penal, for any Man, to propound his Repeal; Yet his Case, even then, had no great Blot of Ignominy, but it was thought, but a Tempest of Popularity, which overthrew him. <hi>Demost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henes</hi> contrariwise, though his Case was foul, being condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for <hi>Bribery;</hi> And not simple <hi>Bribery,</hi> but <hi>Bribery</hi> in the Nature of Treason, and Disloyalty; yet nevertheless took
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64460:17"/>
so little knowledge of his Fortune, as during his Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he did much busie himself, and intermeddle with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>State;</hi> And took upon him to Counsel the <hi>State,</hi> (as if he had been still at the Helm,) by letters; As appears by some <hi>Epistles</hi> of his, which are extant. <hi>Seneca</hi> indeed, who was condemned, for many <hi>Corruptions,</hi> and <hi>Crimes,</hi> and banished into a solitary <hi>Island,</hi> kept a Mean; And though his Pen did not freese, yet he abstained from intruding into Matters of Business; But spent his time, in writing <hi>Books,</hi> of excellent Argument, and Use, for all Ages; Though he might have made better Choice, (sometimes) of his <hi>Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These <hi>Examples</hi> confirmed me much in a Resolution, (whereunto I was otherwise inclined,) to spend my Time wholly in Writing; And to put forth that poor <hi>Talent,</hi> or half <hi>Talent,</hi> or what it is, that God hath given me, not as heretofore to particular <hi>Exchanges,</hi> but to <hi>Banks,</hi> or <hi>Mounts</hi> of Perpetuity, which will not break. Therefore having not long since, set forth a part of my <hi>Instauration;</hi> Which is the Work, that in mine own judgment, <hi>(Si nunquam fallit Imago,)</hi> I do most esteem; I think to proceed in some new paris thereof. And although I have received from many Parts beyond the Seas, Testimonies touching that Work, such as beyond which I could not expect at the first, in so abstruse an Argument; yet nevertheless I have just cause to doubt, that it flies too high over Mens Heads: I have a purpose therefore, (though I break the order of Time,) to draw it down to the sense, by some Patterns of a <hi>Natural Story,</hi> and <hi>Inquisition.</hi> And again, for that my <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Advancement of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> may be some Preparative, or Key, for the better opening of the <hi>Instauration;</hi> Because it exhibits a Mixture, of new Conceits, and old; whereas the <hi>Instauration,</hi> gives the new unmixed, otherwise than with some little Aspersion of the old, for tastes sake; I have thought good to procure a <hi>Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of that <hi>Book,</hi> into the <hi>General Language,</hi> not without great and ample Additions, and Enrichment thereof; Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the <hi>Second Book,</hi> which handleth the <hi>Partition</hi> of <hi>Sciences:</hi> In such sort, as I hold it may serve, in lieu of the <hi>First Part,</hi> of the <hi>Instauration,</hi> and acquit my promise in that
<pb facs="tcp:64460:18"/>
part. Again, because I cannot altogether desert, the Civil Person, that I have born; Which if I should forget, Enough would remember; I have also entred into a work touching <hi>Laws;</hi> Propounding a Character of <hi>Justice,</hi> in a middle term, between the Speculative, and Reverend discourses of Philosophers, and the Writings of <hi>Lawyers,</hi> which are tied, and obnoxious to their particular <hi>Laws.</hi> And although it be true, that I had a purpose, to make a particular <hi>Digest,</hi> or Recompilement, of the <hi>Laws,</hi> of mine own Nation; Yet because it is a Work of Assistance, and that, that I cannot master by mine own Forces, and Pen, I have laid it aside. Now having in the <hi>Work</hi> of my <hi>Instauration,</hi> had in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, the general Good of <hi>Men,</hi> in their very Being, and the Dowries of Nature; And in my <hi>Work</hi> of <hi>Laws,</hi> the general good of <hi>Men</hi> likewise, in Society, and the Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Government; I thought in duty I owed somewhat unto mine own <hi>Country,</hi> which I ever loved; Insomuch as although my Place, hath been far above my desert, yet my Thoughts, and Cares concerning the Good thereof, were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond, and over, and above my place: So now being (as I am) no more able to do my <hi>Country</hi> Service, it remained unto me, to do it Honour: Which I have endeavoured to do, in my <hi>Work,</hi> of the <hi>Reign,</hi> of <hi>King HENRY</hi> the <hi>Seventh.</hi> As for my <hi>Essayes,</hi> and some other Particulars of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I count them, but as the Recreations of my other Studies, and in that sort purpose to continue them; Though I am not ignorant, that those kind of <hi>Writings,</hi> would, with less pains, and embracement, (perhaps,) yield more Lustre, and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to my Name, than those other, which I have in hand. But I account the Vse, that a Man should seek, of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing of his own <hi>Writings</hi> before his Death, to be but an untimely Anticipation of that, which is proper to follow a Man, and not to go along with him.</p>
                  <p>But revolving with my self, my <hi>Writings,</hi> as well those which I have published, as those, which I had in hand, me thought they went all into the <hi>City,</hi> and none into the <hi>Temple;</hi> Where because I have found, so great Consolation, I desire likewise to make some poor Oblation. Therefore I have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen an Argument, mixt of <hi>Religious</hi> and <hi>Civil</hi> Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<pb facs="tcp:64460:18"/>
And likewise mixt between <hi>Contemplative,</hi> and <hi>Active.</hi> For who can tell, whether there may not be an <hi>Exoriere ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis?</hi> Great Matters (especially if they be <hi>Religious</hi>) have (many times) small beginnings; And the Platform, may draw on the Building. This <hi>Work,</hi> because I was ever an Enemy to flattring <hi>Dedications,</hi> I have dedicated to your Lordship; In respect of our ancient, and private Acquaintance; And because amongst the Men of our Times, I hold you in espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Reverence.</p>

                     <hi>Pollio.</hi> Here be four of you, I think, were able to make a good <hi>World;</hi> for you are as differing as the Four <hi>Elements,</hi> and yet you are Friends. As for <hi>Eupolis,</hi> because he is Temperate, and without Passion, he may be the <hi>Fifth Essence. Eupolis.</hi> If we five (<hi>Pollio,</hi>) make the <hi>Great World,</hi> you alone may make the <hi>Little;</hi> Because you profess and practise both, to refer all things to your Self. <hi>Pollio.</hi> And what do they that practise it, and profess it not? <hi>Eupolis.</hi> They are the less Hardy, and the more Dangerous. But come, and sit down with us, for we were speaking of the <hi>Affairs</hi> of <hi>Christendom,</hi> at this day: Wherein we would be glad also, to have your Opinion. <hi>Pollio.</hi> My Lords, I have journeyed this Morning, and it is now the heat of the Day; Therefore your Lordships Discourses had need content my Ears very well, to make them entreat mine Eyes to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64460:20"/>
keep open. But yet if you will give me leave to awake you, when I think your Discourses do but sleep, I will keep watch the best I can. <hi>Eupolis.</hi> You cannot do us a greater Favour. Only I fear, you will think all our Discourses, to be but the better sort of Dreams: For good wishes, without power to effect, are not much more. But Sir, when you came in, <hi>Martius</hi> had both raised our Attentions, and affected us with some Speech he had begun; And it falleth out well, to shake off your Drowsiness, for it seemed to be the <hi>Trumpet</hi> of a <hi>War.</hi> And therefore, (<hi>Martius,</hi>) if it please you, to begin again; For the Speech was such, as deserveth to be heard twice; And I assure you, your Auditory is not a little amended, by the presence of <hi>Pollio. Martius.</hi> When you came in, (<hi>Pollio,</hi>) I was saying freely to these Lords, that I had observed, how by the space now, of half a <hi>Century</hi> of years, there had been (if I may speak it,) a kind of Meanness, in the Designes, and Enterprises of <hi>Christendom.</hi> Wars with <hi>Subjects;</hi> Like an angry Sute for a Mans own, that might be better ended by Accord. Some petty Acquests of a Town, or a Spot of Territory; Like a Farmers Purchase of a Close, or nook of ground, that lay fit for him. And although the <hi>Wars</hi> had been, for a <hi>Naples,</hi> or a <hi>Millain,</hi> or a <hi>Portugal,</hi> or a <hi>Bohemia,</hi> yet these <hi>Wars</hi> were but as the <hi>Wars</hi> of Heathen, (of <hi>Athens,</hi> or <hi>Sparta,</hi> or <hi>Rome,</hi>) for secular Interest, or Ambition, not worthy the <hi>Warfare</hi> of <hi>Christians.</hi> The <hi>Church</hi> (indeed) maketh her Missions, into the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream parts of the <hi>Nations,</hi> and <hi>Isles;</hi> And it is well: But this is, <hi>Ecce Vnus Gladius hic.</hi> The <hi>Christian Princes,</hi> and <hi>Potentates</hi> are they, that are wanting, to the Propagation of the <hi>Faith,</hi> by their <hi>Arms.</hi> Yet our <hi>Lord,</hi> that said on Earth, to the <hi>Disciples, Ite &amp; prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate;</hi> Said from Heaven, to <hi>Constantine, In hoc Signo Vince.</hi> What <hi>Christian Souldier</hi> is there, that will not be touched, with a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Emulation, to see an <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Jesus,</hi> or of Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> or of Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> do such service, for enlarging the <hi>Christian Borders;</hi> And an <hi>Order</hi> of Saint <hi>Fago,</hi> or Saint <hi>Michael,</hi> or Saint <hi>George,</hi> only to Robe, and Feast, and perform Rites, and Observances? Surely the <hi>Merchants</hi> themselves, shall rise in judgment against the <hi>Princes,</hi> and <hi>Nobles</hi> of <hi>Europe:</hi> For they have made a great Path, in the Seas, unto the ends of the World; And set forth Ships, and Forces, of <hi>Spanish, English,</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> enough to make <hi>China</hi> tremble; And all this for <hi>Pearl,</hi> or <hi>Stone,</hi> or <hi>Spices:</hi> But for the <hi>Pearl</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> Or the <hi>Stones</hi> of the <hi>Heavenly Hierusalem,</hi> Or the <hi>Spices</hi> of the <hi>Spouses Garden,</hi> not a <hi>Mast</hi> hath been set up. Nay they can make shift, to shed <hi>Christian</hi> Bloud, so far off amongst themselves, and not a Drop for the Cause of <hi>Christ.</hi> But let me recall my self; I must acknowledge, that within the space of fifty years (whereof I spake,) there have been three Noble, and Memorable <hi>Actions,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Infidels,</hi> wherein the <hi>Christian</hi> hath been the <hi>Invader.</hi> For where it is, upon the Defensive, I reckon it, a <hi>War</hi> of Nature, and not of Piety. The first was, that Famous and Fortunate <hi>War</hi> by <hi>Sea,</hi> that ended in the Victory of <hi>Lepanto;</hi> Which hath put a Hook into the Nostrils of the <hi>Ottomans,</hi> to this day: Which was the Work
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64460:20"/>
(chiefly) of that excellent <hi>Pope, Pius Quintus;</hi> whom I wonder his Successours have not declared a <hi>Saint.</hi> The second was, the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, though Unfortunate, <hi>Expedition,</hi> of <hi>Sebastian King</hi> of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> upon <hi>Asrick,</hi> which was atchieved by him alone; So alone, as left somewhat for others to Excuse. The last was, the brave <hi>Incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> of <hi>Sigismund</hi> the <hi>Transilvanian Prince;</hi> The thred of whose Prosperity was cut off, by the <hi>Christians</hi> themselves; contrary to the Worthy and Paternal Monitories of <hi>Pope Clement the Eighth.</hi> More than these, I do not remember. <hi>Pol.</hi> No! what say you, to the <hi>Extirpation</hi> of the <hi>Moors</hi> of <hi>Valentia? At which sudden Question,</hi> Martius <hi>was a little at a stop, and</hi> Gamaliel <hi>prevented him, and said. Gamaliel.</hi> I think <hi>Martius</hi> did well in omitting that Action, for I, for my part, never approved it; And it seems, <hi>God</hi> was not well pleased with that Deed; For you see the <hi>King,</hi> in whose time it passed, (whom you Catholicks count a Saint-like, and Immaculate <hi>Prince,</hi>) was taken away, in the Flower of his Age: And the <hi>Author,</hi> and great <hi>Counsellour</hi> of that Rigour, (whose Fortunes seemed to be <hi>built upon the Rock,</hi>) is ruined: And it is thought by some, that the reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onings of that Business, are not yet clear'd with <hi>Spain:</hi> For that numbers of those supposed <hi>Moors,</hi> being tried now by their Exile, continue constant in the <hi>Faith,</hi> and true <hi>Christians</hi> in all points, save in the thirst of <hi>Revenge. Zebed.</hi> Make not hasty Judgment, (<hi>Gama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liel,</hi>) of that great action; Which was as <hi>Christs Fan,</hi> in those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; Except you could shew, some such Covenant, from the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> as <hi>Josuah</hi> made with the <hi>Gibeonites;</hi> That that <hi>Cursed Seed</hi> should continue in the Land. And you see, it was done by <hi>Edict,</hi> not tumultuously; The Sword was not put into the <hi>Peoples</hi> hand. <hi>Eupol.</hi> I think, <hi>Martius</hi> did omit it, not as making any Judgment of it, either way; But because it sorted not aptly, with Actions of <hi>War,</hi> being upon Subjects, and without resistance. But let us, if you think good, give <hi>Martius</hi> leave, to proceed in his Discourse; For methought he spake, like a <hi>Divine</hi> in <hi>Armour. Martius.</hi> It is true, (<hi>Eupolis,</hi>) that the Principal Object, which I have before mine Eyes, in that whereof I speak, is Piety, and Religion. But nevertheless, if I should speak only as a Natural Man, I should perswade the same thing. For there is no such Enterprise, at this day, for secular Greatness, and terrene Honour, as a <hi>War</hi> upon <hi>Infidels.</hi> Neither do I, in this, propound a Novelty, or Imagination, but that, which is proved by late Examples of the same kind, though perhaps of less difficulty. The <hi>Castilians,</hi> the Age before that wherein we live, opened the <hi>New World;</hi> And subdued, and planted <hi>Mexico, Peru, Chile,</hi> and other Parts of the <hi>West Indies.</hi> We see what Floods of Treasure, have flowed into <hi>Europe,</hi> by that Action; So that the Cense, or Rates of <hi>Christendom,</hi> are raised since ten times, yea twenty times told. Of this Treasure, it is true, the <hi>Gold</hi> was Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulate, and Store Treasure, for the most part; But the <hi>Silver</hi> is still growing. Besides, infinite is the Access of Territory, and Empire, by the same Enterprise. For there was never an <hi>Hand</hi> drawn, that did double the <hi>Rest,</hi> of the <hi>Habitable World,</hi> before this; For so a
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64460:21"/>
Man may truly term it, if he shall put to account, as well that that is, as that which may be hereafter, by the further Occupation, and Colonizing of those Countries. And yet it cannot be affirmed, (if one speak ingenuously,) that it was the <hi>Propagation</hi> of the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> that was the Adamant of that Discovery, Entry, and Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; But Gold, and Silver, and Temporal Profit, and Glory: So that, what was first in <hi>Gods</hi> Providence, was but second in Mans Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and Intention. The like may be said, of the famous Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, and Conquests of <hi>Emanuel, King</hi> of <hi>Portugal,</hi> whose Armes began to circle <hi>Africk</hi> and <hi>Asia;</hi> and to acquire not only the Trade of Spices, and Stones, and Musk, and Drugs, but Footing, and places, in those extream parts of the <hi>East.</hi> For neither in this, was <hi>Religion</hi> the principal, but Amplification, and Enlargement, of Riches, and Dominion. And the Effect, of these two Enterprises, is now such, that both the <hi>East,</hi> and the <hi>West Indies,</hi> being met in the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> it is come to pass, that as one saith in a brave kind of Expression; <hi>The Sun never sets in the Spanish Dominions, but ever shines, upon one part, or other of them:</hi> Which, to say truly, is a beam of Glory, though I cannot say, it is so solid a Body of Glory, wherein the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> surpasseth all the former <hi>Monarchies.</hi> So as to conclude, we may see, that in these Actions upon <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or <hi>Infidels,</hi> only or chiefly, both the Spiritual, and Temporal, Honour and Good, have been in one pursuit and purchase conjoyned. <hi>Pol.</hi> Methinks, with your favour, you should remember, (<hi>Martins,</hi>) that Wild, and Savage People, are like Beasts, and Birds, which are <hi>Ferae Naturae,</hi> the Property of which passeth with the Possession, and goeth to the Occupant; But of Civil People, it is not so. <hi>Mar.</hi> I know no such difference, amongst reasonable Souls; But that what soever is in order, to the greatest, and most general good of people, may justifie the Action, be the people more, or less Civil. But, (<hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis</hi>) I shall not easily grant, that the people of <hi>Peru,</hi> or <hi>Mexico,</hi> were such brute Savages, as you intend; or that there should be any such difference between them, and many of the Infidels, which are now in other parts. In <hi>Peru,</hi> though they were unapparelled People, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Clime; And had some Customs very barbarous; Yet the <hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>Incae's,</hi> had many parts of Humanity, and Civility. They had reduced the <hi>Nations,</hi> from the <hi>Adoration</hi> of a multitude of <hi>Idols</hi> and <hi>Fancies,</hi> to the <hi>Adoration</hi> of the <hi>Sun.</hi> And, as I remember, the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Wisdom</hi> noteth degrees of <hi>Idolatry;</hi> making that of <hi>Worshipping</hi> Petty and Vile <hi>Idols,</hi> more gross, than simply the <hi>Worshipping</hi> of the <hi>Creature.</hi> And some of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> as I take it, do the like, in the Metaphore, of more ugly, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial <hi>Fornication.</hi> The <hi>Peruvians</hi> also, (under the <hi>Incaes,</hi>) had magnificent Temples of their Superstition; They had strict and regular Justice; They bare great Faith, and Obedience to their <hi>Kings;</hi> They proceeded in a kind of Martial Justice with their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, offering them their Law, as better for their own good, before they drew their Sword. And much like, was the State of <hi>Mexico,</hi> being an <hi>Elective Monarchy.</hi> As for those people of the East, (<hi>Goa,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64460:21"/>
Calecute, Malaca,</hi>) they were a fine, and dainty people, Frugal, and yet Elegant, though not Militar. So that if things be rightly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the <hi>Empire</hi> of the <hi>Turks</hi> may be truly affirmed, to be more barbarous, than any of these. A cruel Tyranny, bathed in the blood of their Emperours, upon every Succession: A heap of Vassals and Slaves: No Nobles, No Gentlemen: No Free-men, No Inheritance of Land, No Stirp or Ancient Families: A peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that is without <hi>Natural Affection,</hi> and, as the <hi>Scripture</hi> saith, that <hi>Regardeth not the desires of Women:</hi> And without Piety, or care towards their Children: A <hi>Nation</hi> without Morality, without Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Arts, or Sciences; That can scarce measure an Acre of Land, or an hour of the Day: Base and sluttish in Buildings, Diets, and the like: And in a word, a very reproach of Human Society: And yet this <hi>Nation</hi> hath made the <hi>Garden</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> a <hi>Wilderness;</hi> For that, as it is truly said, concerning <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Pollio.</hi> Yet in the midst of your Invective, (<hi>Martius,</hi>) do the <hi>Turks</hi> this right, as to remember, that they are no <hi>Idolaters:</hi> For if, as you say, there be a difference, between <hi>Worshipping</hi> a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>Idol,</hi> and the <hi>Sun;</hi> There is a much greater difference, between worshipping a <hi>Creature,</hi> and the <hi>Creator.</hi> For the <hi>Turks</hi> do acknowledge <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father, Creator</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> being the first Person in the <hi>Trinity,</hi> though they deny the rest. <hi>At which Speech, when</hi> Martius <hi>made some pause,</hi> Zebedaeus <hi>replied with a Countenance of great Reprehension, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity. Zebed.</hi> We must take heed, (<hi>Pollio,</hi>) that we fall not at unawares, into the Heresie of <hi>Manuel Comnenus, Emperour</hi> of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia;</hi> Who affirmed, that <hi>Mahomets God,</hi> was the true <hi>God;</hi> Which Opinion was not only rejected, and condemned by the <hi>Synod,</hi> but imputed to the <hi>Emperour,</hi> as extream Madness; Being reproached to him also, by the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> in those bitter, and strange Words, as are not to be named. <hi>Martius.</hi> I confess, that it is my Opinion, that a <hi>War</hi> upon the <hi>Turk,</hi> is more worthy, than upon any other Gentiles, Infidels, or Savages, that either have been, or now are, both in point of <hi>Religion,</hi> and in point of <hi>Honour;</hi> Though fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility, and hope of Success, might (perhaps) invite some other Choice. But before I proceed, both my Self would be glad to take some Breath; And I shall frankly desire, that some of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships would take your turn to speak, that can do it better. But chiefly, for that I see here some, that are excellent Interpreters of the <hi>Divine Law,</hi> though in several ways; And that I have reason to distrust mine own Judgment, both as weak in it self, and as that, which may be overborn by my Zeal, and Affection to this Cause. I think it were an Errour to speak further, till I may see some sound Foundation laid, of the <hi>Lawfulness</hi> of the <hi>Action,</hi> by them that are better versed in that Argument. <hi>Eupolis.</hi> I am glad, (<hi>Martius,</hi>) to see in a Person of your Profession, so great Moderation, in that you are not transported in an Action, that warms the blood, and is appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Holy, to blaunch, or take for admitted, the point of <hi>Lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> And because methinks this Conference prospers, if your
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64460:22"/>
Lordships will give me leave, I will make some motion, touching the distribution of it into Parts. <hi>Unto which, when they all assented, Eupolis</hi> said. <hi>Eupolis.</hi> I think, it would not sort amiss, if <hi>Zebedaeus</hi> would be pleased, to handle the Question; Whether a <hi>War,</hi> for the <hi>Propagation</hi> of the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> without other cause of Hostili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, be lawful, or no, and in what Cases? I confess also, I would be glad to go a little further; And to hear it spoken to, concerning the <hi>Lawfulness,</hi> not only permissively, but whether it be not Obligatory, to <hi>Christian Princes,</hi> and <hi>States,</hi> to design it: Which part, if it please <hi>Gamaliel</hi> to undertake, the point of the <hi>Lawfulness,</hi> taken simply, will be Compleat. Yet there resteth the <hi>Comparative:</hi> That is, it being granted, that it is either <hi>Lawful,</hi> or <hi>Binding,</hi> yet whether other things be not to be preferr'd before it; As <hi>Extirpation</hi> of <hi>Heresies; Reconcilements</hi> of <hi>Schisms; Pursuit</hi> of <hi>Lawful Temporal Rights,</hi> and <hi>Quarrels;</hi> and the like: And how far this <hi>Enterprise,</hi> ought either to wait upon these other Matters; Or to be mingled with them; Or to pass by them, and give Law to them, as inferiour unto it self; And because this is a great part, and <hi>Eusebius</hi> hath yet said nothing, we will, by way of Mulct, or Pain, if your Lordships think good, lay it upon him. All this while, I doubt much, that <hi>Pollio,</hi> who hath a sharp Wit of Discovery, towards what is Solid and Real, and what is Specious and Aiery, will esteem all this but <hi>Impossibilities,</hi> and Eagles in the Clouds: And therefore we shall all intreat him, to crush this <hi>Argument,</hi> with his best Forces; That by the Light, we shall take from him, we may either cast it away, if it be found but a Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; Or discharge it, of so much as is vain, and not sperable. And because, I confess, I my self am not of that Opinion, although it be an hard Encounter to deal with <hi>Pollio,</hi> yet I shall do my best, to prove the <hi>Enterprise Possible;</hi> And to shew, how all <hi>Impediments</hi> may be either removed, or overcomen. And then it will be fit for <hi>Martius,</hi> (if we do not desert it before,) to resume his further Discourse, as well for the <hi>Perswasive,</hi> as for the <hi>Consult,</hi> touching the <hi>Means, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations,</hi> and all that may conduce unto the <hi>Enterprise.</hi> But this is but my Wish, your Lordships will put it into better order. <hi>They all not only allowed the</hi> Distribution, <hi>but accepted the</hi> Parts: <hi>But because the Day was spent, they agreed, to defer it, till the next Morning. Only</hi> Pollio <hi>said. Pollio.</hi> You take me right, (<hi>Eupolis;</hi>) For I am of opinion, that except you could bray <hi>Christendom</hi> in a Mortar, and mould it into a New Past, there is no <hi>Possibilitie</hi> of an <hi>Holy War.</hi> And I was ever of opinion, that the <hi>Philosophers Stone,</hi> and an <hi>Holy War,</hi> were but the <hi>Rendezvous</hi> of Crackt Brains, that wore their Feather in their Head, instead of their Hat. Nevertheless, believe me of Courtesie, that if you <hi>Five</hi> shall be of another mind, especially after you have heard what I can say, I shall be ready to certifie with <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,</hi> that <hi>Athens</hi> is mad, and <hi>Democritus</hi> is only sober. And lest you should take me for altogether Adverse, I will frankly contribute to the Business, now at first. Ye, no doubt, will amongst you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise and discourse many solemn Matters: But do as I shall tell you. This <hi>Pope</hi> is Decrepit, and the Bell goeth for him. Take order, that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64460:22"/>
when he is Dead, there be chosen a <hi>Pope</hi> of fresh years, between fifty and threescore; And see that he take the Name of <hi>Urban,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a <hi>Pope</hi> of that Name did first institute the <hi>Cruzada;</hi> And, (as with an holy Trumpet,) did stir up the <hi>Voyage,</hi> for the <hi>Holy Land. Eupolis.</hi> You say well; but be, I pray you, a little more serious in this Conference.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The next day, the same</hi> Persons <hi>met, as they had appointed; And after they were set, and that there had passed some sporting speeches from</hi> Pollio, <hi>how the</hi> War <hi>was already begun; For that, (he said) he had dream't of nothing but</hi> Janizaries, <hi>and</hi> Tartars, <hi>and</hi> Sultans <hi>all the night long,</hi> Martius <hi>said. Martius.</hi> The <hi>Distribution</hi> of this Conference, which was made by <hi>Eupolis</hi> yesternight, and was by us approved, seemeth to me perfect, save in one Point; and that is, not in the <hi>Number,</hi> but in the <hi>Placing</hi> of the <hi>Parts.</hi> For it is so disposed, that <hi>Pollio</hi> and <hi>Eupolis,</hi> shall debate the <hi>Possibility,</hi> or <hi>Impossibility</hi> of the <hi>Action,</hi> before I shall deduce the <hi>Particulars</hi> of the <hi>Means,</hi> and <hi>Manner,</hi> by which it is to be atchieved. Now I have often observed in <hi>Deliberations,</hi> that the entring near hand, into the manner of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, and Execution of that, which is under Deliberation, hath quite overturn'd the Opinion formerly conceiv'd, of the <hi>Possibility,</hi> or <hi>Impossibility.</hi> So that things, that at the first shew, seemed <hi>Possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> by Ripping up the Performance of them, have been convicted of <hi>Impossibility;</hi> and things, that, on the other side, have shewed <hi>Impossible,</hi> by the Declaration of the Means to effect them, as by a back Light, have appeared <hi>Possible,</hi> the way thorow them being discerned. This I speak, not to alter the Order, but only to desire <hi>Pollio,</hi> and <hi>Eupolis,</hi> not to speak peremptorily, or conclusively, touching the Point of <hi>Possibility,</hi> till they have heard me deduce the <hi>Means</hi> of the Execution: And that done, to reserve themselves at liberty for a Reply, after they had before them, as it were, a Model of the <hi>Enterprise. This grave and solid Advertisement, and Caution of</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, <hi>was much commended by them all; Whereupon</hi> Eupolis <hi>said. Eupolis.</hi> Since <hi>Martius</hi> hath begun to refine that, which was yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night resolved; I may the better have leave, (especially in the mending of a Proposition, which was mine own,) to remember an Omission, which is more than a misplacing. For I doubt, we ought to have added, or inserted into the point of <hi>Lawfulness,</hi> the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion; How far an <hi>Holy War</hi> is to be pursued, whether to Displant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Exterminion of <hi>People?</hi> And again, whether to enforce a new Belief, and to vindicate, or punish Infidelity; Or only to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Countries and People; And so, by the Temporal Sword, to open a Door, for the Spiritual Sword to enter, by Perswasion, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, and such Means, as are proper for Souls and Consciences? But it may be, neither is this necessary, to be made a Part by it self; For that <hi>Zebedaeus,</hi> in his wisdom will fall into it, as an incident to the Point of <hi>Lawfulness,</hi> which cannot be handled without Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Distinctions. <hi>Zebedaeus.</hi> You encourage me, (<hi>Eupolis,</hi>) in that I perceive, how in your Judgment, (which I do so much esteem,) I ought to take that Course, which of my self I was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64460:23"/>
to do. For as <hi>Martius</hi> noted well, that it is but a loose thing, to speak of <hi>Possibilities,</hi> without the particular <hi>Designs;</hi> So is it, to speak of <hi>Lawfulness,</hi> without the particular <hi>Cases.</hi> I will therefore, first of all, distinguish the <hi>Cases;</hi> Though you shall give me leave in the handling of them, not to sever them, with too much Preciseness: For both it would cause needless Length; And we are not now in <hi>Arts,</hi> or <hi>Methods,</hi> but in a <hi>Conference.</hi> It is therefore, first to be put to Question in general, (as <hi>Eupolis</hi> propounded it,) whether it be <hi>lawful</hi> for Christian Princes, or States, to make an <hi>Invasive War,</hi> only and simply, for the <hi>Propagation</hi> of the <hi>Faith,</hi> without other Cause of Hostility, or Circumstance, that may provoke and induce the <hi>War?</hi> Secondly, whether it being made part of the Case, that the Countries were once <hi>Christian,</hi> and Members of the <hi>Church,</hi> and where the <hi>Golden Candlesticks</hi> did stand, though now they be utterly alienated, and no <hi>Christians</hi> left; it be not lawful to make a <hi>War,</hi> to restore them to the <hi>Church,</hi> as an ancient Patrimony of <hi>Christ?</hi> Thirdly, if it be made a further part of the Case, that there are yet remaining in the Countries, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of <hi>Christians,</hi> whether it be not <hi>lawful</hi> to make a <hi>War,</hi> to free them, and deliver them, from the servitude of the <hi>Infidels?</hi> Fourthly, whether it be not <hi>Lawful</hi> to make a <hi>War,</hi> for the Purging, and Recovery of Consecrate Places, being now polluted, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned; As the <hi>Holy City,</hi> and <hi>Sepulchre,</hi> and such other places of principal Adoration, and Devotion? Fifthly, whether it be not <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> to make a <hi>War,</hi> for the Revenge, or Vindication of Blasphemies, and Reproaches, against the <hi>Deity,</hi> and our <hi>Blessed Saviour;</hi> Or for the Effusion of <hi>Christian Blood,</hi> and Cruelties against <hi>Christians,</hi> though ancient, and long since past; Considering that <hi>Gods</hi> Visits, are without limitation of Time; And many times, do but expect the fullness of the Sin? Sixthly, it is to be considered, (as <hi>Eupolis</hi> now last well remembred,) whether a <hi>Holy War,</hi> (which, as in the Worthiness of the Quarrel, so in the Justness of the Prosecution, ought to exceed all Temporal <hi>Wars,</hi>) may be pursued, either to the Expulsion of People, or the Enforcement of Consciences, or the like Extremities; Or how to be moderated, and limited; Lest whilst we remember we are <hi>Christians,</hi> we forget that others are Men; But there is a <hi>Point,</hi> that precedeth all these Points recited; Nay, and in a manner dischargeth them, in the particular of a <hi>War</hi> against the <hi>Turk:</hi> which <hi>Point,</hi> I think, would not have come into my thought, but that <hi>Martius</hi> giving us yesterday, a Representation of the <hi>Empire</hi> of the <hi>Turks,</hi> with no small vigour of words, (which you (<hi>Pollio</hi>) called an Invective, but was indeed a true Charge,) did put me in mind of it: And the more I think upon it, the more I set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in Opinion; That a <hi>War,</hi> to suppress that <hi>Empire,</hi> though we set aside the Cause of <hi>Religion,</hi> were a just <hi>War. After</hi> Zebedaeus <hi>had said this, he made a Pause, to see whether any of the rest would say any thing: But when he perceived nothing, but Silence, and Signs of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, to that he would further say, he proceeded thus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Zebedaeus.</hi> Your Lordships will not look for a <hi>Treatise</hi> from me,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64460:23"/>
but a Speech of <hi>Consultation;</hi> And in that Brevity and Manner, will I speak. First, I shall agree, that as the <hi>Cause</hi> of a <hi>War</hi> ought to be Just; So the <hi>Justice</hi> of that <hi>Cause</hi> ought to be Evident; Not Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure, not Scrupulous. For by the consent of all Laws, in Capital Causes, the Evidence must be full and clear: And if so, where one Mans life is in Question, what say we to a <hi>War,</hi> which is ever the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Death upon many? We must beware therefore, how we make a <hi>Moloch,</hi> or an <hi>Heatlien Idol,</hi> of our <hi>Blessed Saviour,</hi> in sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing the Blood of Men to him, by an unjust <hi>War.</hi> The <hi>Justice</hi> of every <hi>Action,</hi> consisteth in the <hi>Merits</hi> of the <hi>Cause,</hi> the <hi>Warrant</hi> of the <hi>Jurisdiction,</hi> and the <hi>Form</hi> of the <hi>Prosecution.</hi> As for the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Intention,</hi> I leave it, to the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Heaven.</hi> Of these things severally, as they may have Relation to the present subject of a <hi>War</hi> against <hi>Infidels;</hi> And namely, against the most Potent, and most Dangerous Enemy of the <hi>Faith,</hi> the <hi>Turk.</hi> I hold, and I doubt not, but I shall make it plain, (as far as a Sum, or Breef can make a Cause plain,) that a <hi>War</hi> against the <hi>Turk,</hi> is <hi>Lawful,</hi> both by the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>Nations;</hi> And by the <hi>Law Divine,</hi> which is the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the other two. As for the <hi>Laws Positive,</hi> and <hi>Civil</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> or other whatsoever, they are too small Engins, to move the Weight of this Question. And therefore, in my judgment, many of the late <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> (though excellent Men,) take not the right way in disputing this Question; Except they had the gift of <hi>Navius,</hi> that they could <hi>Cotem novaculâ scindere; Hew Stones with Pen-knives.</hi> First, for the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature.</hi> The Philosopher <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> is no ill Interpreter thereof. He hath set many Men on work, with a witty speech of <hi>Naturâ Dominus,</hi> and <hi>Naturâ Servus;</hi> Affirm ing expresly, and positively; <hi>That from the very Nativity, some things are born to Rule, and some things to Obey.</hi> Which Oracle hath been taken in diverssenses. Some have taken it, for a Speech of Ostentation, to entitle the <hi>Grecians</hi> to an <hi>Empire</hi> over the <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> Which indeed was better maintained by his Scholar <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi> Some have taken it, for a Speculative Platform, that Reason and Nature would, that the best should govern; But, not in any wise to create a Right. But for my part, I take it neither for a brag, nor for a wish; but for a Truth, as he limiteth it. For he saith, That if there can be found, such an Inequality between Man and Man, as there is between Man and Beast, or between Soul and Body, it investeth a Right of Government; Which seemeth rather an Impossible Case, than an untrue Sentence. But I hold both the <hi>Judgment</hi> true, and the <hi>Case</hi> possible; And such as hath had, and hath a Being, both in particular Men, and Nations. But ere we go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, let us confine Ambiguities, and Mistakings, that they trouble us not. First, to say, that the more Capable, or the better Deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, hath such Right to Govern, as he may compulsorily bring under the less Worthy, is Idle. Men will never agree upon it, who is the more Worthy. For it is not only in order of Nature, for him to govern, that is the more Intelligent, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> would have it; But there is no less required for Government, Courage to protect; and,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64460:24"/>
above all, Honesty, and Probity of the Will, to abstain from Injury. So Fitness to govern, is a perplexed Business. Some Men, some Nations, excel in the one ability, some in the other. Therefore the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, which I intend, is not in the <hi>Comparative,</hi> that the Wiser, or the Stouter, or the juster Nation should govern; But in the <hi>Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> that where there is an heap of People (though we term it a Kingdom, or State,) that is altogether unable, or indign to govern; There it is a just Cause of <hi>War,</hi> for another Nation, that is Civil, or Polliced, to subdue them: And this, though it were to be done, by a <hi>Cyrus,</hi> or a <hi>Caesar,</hi> that were no Christian. The second mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, to be banished, is; That I understand not this of a <hi>Personal Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,</hi> as was the State of <hi>Rome,</hi> under a <hi>Caligula,</hi> or a <hi>Nero,</hi> or a <hi>Commodus;</hi> Shall the Nation suffer for that wherein they suffer? But when the Constitution of the State, and the fundamental Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms, and <hi>Laws</hi> of the same, (if <hi>Laws</hi> they may be called,) are against the <hi>Laws</hi> of Nature, and Nations, then I say, a <hi>War</hi> upon them is lawful. I shall divide the Question into three parts. First, whether there be, or may be, any <hi>Nation,</hi> or <hi>Society</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> against whom it is lawful to make a <hi>War,</hi> without a <hi>Precedent Injury,</hi> or <hi>Provocation?</hi> Secondly, what are those <hi>Breaches</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>Nations,</hi> which do forfeit, and devest, all Right, and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, in a Nation to govern? And thirdly, whether those <hi>Breaches</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>Nations,</hi> be <hi>found</hi> in any <hi>Nation,</hi> at this day; And namely in the <hi>Empire</hi> of the <hi>Ottomans?</hi> For the first, I hold it clear, that such Nations, or States, or Societies of People, there may be, and are. There cannot be a better ground laid, to declare this, than to look into the Original Donation of Government. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it well; Especially the <hi>Inducement,</hi> or <hi>Preface.</hi> Saith <hi>God: Let us make man after our own Image, and let him have dominion, over the Fishes of the Sea, and the Fowls of the Air, and the Beasts of the Land, &amp;c.</hi> Hereupon <hi>De Victoria,</hi> and with him some others, infer excellently, and extract, a most true, and divine Aphorism; <hi>Non sundatur Dominium, nisi in Imagine Dei.</hi> Here we have the <hi>Charter</hi> of Foundation: It is now the more easie to judg of the <hi>Forfeiture,</hi> or <hi>Reseisure.</hi> Deface the <hi>Image,</hi> and you devest the <hi>Right.</hi> But what is this <hi>Image,</hi> and how is it defaced? The <hi>Poor Men</hi> of <hi>Lyons,</hi> and some Fanatical Spirits will tell you, that the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> is <hi>Purity;</hi> And the <hi>Defacement Sin.</hi> But this subverteth all Government: Neither did <hi>Adams</hi> Sin, or the Curse upon it, deprive him of his Rule, but left the Creatures, to a Rebellion, or Relucta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And therefore, if you note it attentively, when this <hi>Charter</hi> was renewed unto <hi>Noah,</hi> and his <hi>Sons,</hi> it is not by the words, <hi>Tou shall have Dominion:</hi> But, <hi>Your Fear shall be upon all the Beasts of the Land, and the Birds of the Air, and all that moveth;</hi> Not re-grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Soveraignty, which stood firm; But protecting it against the Reluctation. The sound Interpreters therefore, expound this <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> of <hi>Natural Reason;</hi> Which if it be totally, or mostly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced, the <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> doth cease: And if you mark all the Interpreters well, still they doubt of the <hi>Case,</hi> and not of the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64460:24"/>
                     <hi>Law.</hi> But this is properly to be spoken to, in handling the second <hi>Point,</hi> when we shall define of the <hi>Defacements.</hi> To go on. The <hi>Prophet Hosea,</hi> in the Person of <hi>God,</hi> saith of the <hi>Jews; They have reigned, but not by me; They have set a Signory over themselves, but I knew nothing of it.</hi> Which place proveth plainly, that there are <hi>Governments,</hi> which <hi>God</hi> doth not avow. For though they be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by his secret Providence, yet they are not knowledged by his revealed Will: Neither can this be meant of evil Governours, or Tyrants: For they are often avowed, and stablished, as lawful Potentates; But of some perversness and defection, in the very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it self; Which appeareth most manifestly, in that the <hi>Prophet</hi> speaketh, of the <hi>Signory</hi> in <hi>Abstracto,</hi> and not of the <hi>Person</hi> of the <hi>Lord.</hi> And although some <hi>Hereticks,</hi> of those we speak of, have abused this <hi>Text,</hi> yet the <hi>Sun</hi> is not soiled in Passage. And again, if any Man infer, upon the words of the <hi>Prophets</hi> following, (which declare this <hi>Rejection,</hi> and to use the words of the <hi>Text, Rescision</hi> of their <hi>Estate,</hi> to have been for their <hi>Idolatry,</hi>) that by this Reason, the <hi>Governments</hi> of all <hi>Idolatrous Nations,</hi> should be also dissolved, (which is manifestly untrue,) in my judgment it followeth not. For the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> then, and the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the <hi>Heathen</hi> then and now, are Sins of a far differing Nature, in regard of the special Covenant, and the clear manifestations, wherein <hi>God</hi> did contract, and exhibit himself to that <hi>Nation.</hi> This <hi>Nullity</hi> of <hi>Policy,</hi> and <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Estate,</hi> in some <hi>Nations,</hi> is yet more significantly expressed, by <hi>Moses</hi> in his <hi>Canticle:</hi> In the Person of <hi>God</hi> to the <hi>Jews: Ye have incensed me with Gods, that are no Gods, and I will incense you with a People, that are no People.</hi> Such as were (no doubt) the <hi>People</hi> of <hi>Canaan,</hi> after <hi>Seisin</hi> was given, of the <hi>Land</hi> of <hi>Promise,</hi> to the <hi>Israelites.</hi> For from that time, their Right to the <hi>Land</hi> was dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, though they remained in many Places unconquered. By this we may see, that there are <hi>Nations</hi> in <hi>Name,</hi> that are no <hi>Nations</hi> in Right, but multitudes only, and swarms of People. For like as there are <hi>Particular Persons,</hi> utlawed, and proscribed by civil Laws, of several Countries; So are there <hi>Nations,</hi> that are utlawed, and proscribed, by the Law of Nature, and Nations; Or by the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Commandment of God. And as there are <hi>Kings de Facto,</hi> and not <hi>de Jure,</hi> in respect of the Nullity of their Title; So are there <hi>Nations,</hi> that are Occupants <hi>de Facto,</hi> and not <hi>de Jure,</hi> of their Territories, in respect of the Nullity, of their Policy, or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But let us take in some <hi>Examples,</hi> into the midst of our <hi>Proofs;</hi> For they will prove as much as put after; And illustrate more. It was never doubted, but a <hi>War</hi> upon <hi>Pyrates,</hi> may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully made, by any Nation, though not infested, or violated by them. Is it because, they have not <hi>Certas Sedes,</hi> or <hi>Lares?</hi> In the <hi>Pyratical War,</hi> which was atchieved by <hi>Pompey</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> and was his truest, and greatest glory; the <hi>Pyrates</hi> had some Cities, sundry Ports, and a great part of the Province of <hi>Cilicia;</hi> And the <hi>Pyrates</hi> now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing have a Receptacle, and Mansion in <hi>Algiers.</hi> Beasts are not the less Savage; because they have Dens. Is it because the danger
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64460:25"/>
hovers, as a Cloud, that a Man cannot tell, where it will fall; And so it is every Mans Case. The Reason is good; But it is not all, nor that which is most alledged. For the true received Reason is, that <hi>Pyrates</hi> are <hi>Communes Humani Generis Hostes;</hi> Whom all Nations are to prosecute, not so much in the Right of their own Fears, as upon the Band of Humane Society. For as there are formal and written Leagues, Respective to certain Enemies; So is there a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and Tacite Confederation, amongst all Men, against the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy of Humane Society. So as there needs no Intimation, or Denunciation of the <hi>War;</hi> There needs no Request from the <hi>Nation</hi> grieved; But all these Formalities, the Law of Nature sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, in the Case of <hi>Pyrates.</hi> The same is the Case of <hi>Rovers</hi> by <hi>Land;</hi> Such as yet are some <hi>Cantons</hi> in <hi>Arabia;</hi> And some petty <hi>Kings</hi> of the <hi>Mountains,</hi> adjacent to <hi>Streights,</hi> and <hi>Ways.</hi> Neither is it lawful, only for the <hi>Neighbour Princes,</hi> to destroy such <hi>Pyrates,</hi> or <hi>Rovers;</hi> But if there were any <hi>Nation,</hi> never so far off, that would make it an <hi>Enterprise</hi> of Merit, and true Glory, (as the <hi>Romans,</hi> that made a <hi>War</hi> for the Liberty of <hi>Grecia,</hi> from a distant and remote part,) no doubt they might do it. I make the same Judgment, of that <hi>Kingdom</hi> of the <hi>Assasins,</hi> now destroyed, which was situate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Borders of <hi>Saraca;</hi> And was, for a time, a great Terrour to all the <hi>Princes</hi> of the <hi>Levant.</hi> There the Custom was, that upon the Commandment of their <hi>King,</hi> and a blind Obedience to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thereunto, any of them was to undertake, in the nature of a Votary, the insidious Murther of any <hi>Prince,</hi> or <hi>Person,</hi> upon whom the Commandment went. This Custom, without all question, made their whole <hi>Government</hi> void, as an Engine built against <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Society,</hi> worthy by all Men to be fired, and pulled down. I say the like, of the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> of <hi>Munster;</hi> And this, although they had not been <hi>Rebels</hi> to the <hi>Empire:</hi> And put Case likewise, that they had done no Mischief at all actually: yet if there shall be a Congregation, and consent of People, that shall hold all things to be lawful; Not according to any certain Laws, or Rules, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the secret, and variable Motions, and Instincts of the Spirit; This is indeed no <hi>Nation,</hi> no <hi>People,</hi> no <hi>Signory,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> doth know: Any Nation, that is Civil, and Polliced, may (if they will not be reduced,) cut them off, from the Face of the Earth. Now let me put a feigned Case, (And yet Antiquity makes it doubtful, whether it were Fiction, or History,) of a <hi>Land</hi> of <hi>Amazons,</hi> where the whole <hi>Government,</hi> publick and private, yea the <hi>Militia</hi> it Self, was in the hands of <hi>Women.</hi> I demand, is not such a Preposterous <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> (against the first Order of Nature, for <hi>Women</hi> to rule over <hi>Men,</hi>) in it self void, and to be suppressed? I speak not of the <hi>Reign of Women;</hi> (For that is supplied by Counsel, and subordinate Magistrates Masculine;) But where the <hi>Regiment</hi> of State, Justice, Families, is all managed by <hi>Women.</hi> And yet this last <hi>Case,</hi> differeth from the other before: Because in the rest there is Terrour of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but in this there is only Errour of Nature. Neither should I make any great difficulty, to affirm the same, of the <hi>Sultanry</hi> of the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:64460:25"/>
                     <hi>Mamaluches;</hi> where <hi>Slaves,</hi> and none but <hi>Slaves,</hi> bought for Money, and of unknown Descent, reigned over Families of <hi>Free-men.</hi> And much like were the Case, if you suppose a <hi>Nation,</hi> where the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom were, that after full Age, the <hi>Sons</hi> should Expulse their <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> and <hi>Mothers,</hi> out of their Possessions, and put them to their Pensions: For these Cases, of <hi>Women</hi> to govern <hi>Men, Sons</hi> the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Slaves Free-Men,</hi> are much in the same degree; All being total Violations and Perversions, of the Laws of Nature, and Nations. For the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> I perceive (<hi>Martins</hi>) you have read <hi>Garcilazzo de Viega,</hi> who himself was descended of the race of the <hi>Incaes,</hi> a <hi>Mestizo,</hi> and is willing to make the best, of the Vertues and Manners of his <hi>Country.</hi> And yet, in troth, he doth it soberly, and credibly enough. Yet you shall hardly edifie me, that those <hi>Nations</hi> might not, by the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> have been subdued by any <hi>Nation,</hi> that had only Policy, and Moral Vertue; Though the <hi>Propagation</hi> of the <hi>Faith,</hi> (whereof we shall speak in the proper place,) were set by, and not made part of the <hi>Case.</hi> Surely, their <hi>Nakedness,</hi> (being with them, in most parts of that Country, without all Vail or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering,) was a great Defacement: For in the acknowledgment of <hi>

                        </gap>,</hi> was the first Sense of Sin: And the <hi>Heresie</hi> of the <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> was ever accounted an affront of Nature. But upon these I stand not: Nor yet upon their <hi>Idiocy,</hi> in thinking that <hi>Horses</hi> did eat their Bitts, and <hi>Letters</hi> speak, and the like. Nor yet upon their <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceries,</hi> which are (almost) common to all <hi>Idolatrous Nations.</hi> But, I say, their <hi>Sacrificing,</hi> and, more especially, their <hi>Eating</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> is such an Abomination, as (methinks) a Mans Face should be a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused, to deny, that this Custom joyned with the rest, did not make it lawful, for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to invade their Territory, forfeited by the Law of Nature; And either to reduce them, or displant them.

The first <hi>Argument</hi> shall be this. It is a great Errour, and a narrowness, or straightness of Mind, if any Man think, that Nations have nothing to do one with another, except there be, either an Union in Soveraignty, or a Conjunction in Pacts or Leagues. There are other <hi>Bands</hi> of <hi>Society,</hi> and implicite <hi>Confederation.</hi> That of <hi>Colonies,</hi> or <hi>Transmigrants,</hi> towards their <hi>Mother Nation. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> unius labii</hi> is somewhat; For as the <hi>Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:64460:26"/>
of <hi>Tongues,</hi> was a mark of Separation, so the <hi>Being</hi> of <hi>one Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,</hi> is a mark of Union. To have the same <hi>Fundamental Laws,</hi> and <hi>Customs,</hi> in chief, is yet more; As it was between the <hi>Grecians,</hi> in respect of the <hi>Barbarians.</hi> To be of one <hi>Sect,</hi> or <hi>Worship;</hi> If it be a <hi>False Worship,</hi> I speak not of it, for that is but <hi>Fratres in Malo.</hi> But above all these, there is the Supream, and Indissoluble <hi>Consan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity,</hi> and <hi>Society,</hi> between <hi>Men</hi> in general: Of which the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Poet,</hi> (whom the <hi>Apostle</hi> calls to witness,) saith; <hi>We are all his Generation.</hi> But much more, we <hi>Christians,</hi> unto whom it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in particularity, that all <hi>Men</hi> came from one <hi>Lump</hi> of <hi>Earth;</hi> And that two singular <hi>Persons,</hi> were the <hi>Parents,</hi> from whom all the <hi>Generations</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> are descended. We (I say) ought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that no <hi>Nations,</hi> are wholly Aliens, and Strangers, the one to the other: And not to be less charitable, than the person in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced by the <hi>Comick Poet; Homosum, Humani nihil à me alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num puto.</hi> Now if there be such a <hi>Tacite League,</hi> or <hi>Confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> sure it is not idle; It is against somewhat, or some Body: Who should they be? Is it against <hi>Wild Beasts?</hi> Or the <hi>Elements,</hi> of <hi>Fire,</hi> and <hi>Water?</hi> No, it is against such <hi>Routs,</hi> and <hi>Sholes</hi> of <hi>People,</hi> as have utterly degenerate, from the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Nature;</hi> As have, in their very Body, and frame of Estate, a <hi>Monsirosity;</hi> And may be truly accounted, (according to the <hi>Examples</hi> we have formerly reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,) <hi>Common Enemies,</hi> and <hi>Grievances</hi> of <hi>Mankind;</hi> Or <hi>Disgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> and <hi>Reproaches to Humane Nature.</hi> Such People, all Nations are interessed, and ought to be resenting, to suppress; Considering that the <hi>Particular States</hi> themselves, being the <hi>Delinquents,</hi> can give no redress. And this I say, is not to be measured so much, by the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> of <hi>Jurists,</hi> as by <hi>Lex Charitatis; Lex proximi,</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the <hi>Samaritan,</hi> as well as the <hi>Levite; Lex Filiorum Adae de Massâ unâ:</hi> Upon which <hi>Original Laws,</hi> this Opinion is grounded: Which to deny, (if a man may speak freely,) were almost to be a <hi>Schismatick</hi> in <hi>Nature.</hi>

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:64460:28"/>
Cobwebs, and that good <hi>Princes</hi> will do well without them, and bad will not stand much upon them; The Discourse is neither good, nor wise. For certain it is, that good <hi>Laws,</hi> are some bridle to bad <hi>Princes;</hi> And as a very <hi>Wall about Government.</hi> And if Tyrants (sometime) make a breach into them, yet they mollifie even Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny it self; As <hi>Solons Laws</hi> did the <hi>Tyranny</hi> of <hi>Pisistratus:</hi> And then (commonly) they get up again, upon the first Advantage of better times. Other means to perpetuate the Memory, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of <hi>Soveraign Princes,</hi> are inferiour to this. <hi>Buildings</hi> of <hi>Temples, Tombs, Palaces, Theaters,</hi> and the like, are honourable things, and look big upon Posterity. But <hi>Constantine</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> gave the Name well to those works, when he used to call <hi>Trajan,</hi> that was a great <hi>Builder, Parietaria, Wall-Flower;</hi> Because his <hi>Name</hi> was upon so many <hi>Walls.</hi> So if that be the Matter, that a <hi>King</hi> would turn <hi>Wall-flower,</hi> or <hi>Fellitory</hi> of the <hi>Wall,</hi> with cost he may. <hi>Adrian's</hi> vein was better; For his mind was to wrestle a fall with Time; And being a great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressour through all the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> when ever he found any <hi>Decaies</hi> of Bridges, or High-ways, or Cuts of Rivers and Sewers, or Walls, or Banks, or the like, he gave substantial order, for their repair with the better. He gave also Multitudes of <hi>Charters,</hi> and <hi>Liberties,</hi> for the comfort of Corporations, and Companies in decay. So that his Bounty did strive with the <hi>Ruines</hi> of <hi>Time.</hi> But yet this, though it were an excellent Disposition, went but (in effect) to the Cases and Shells of a <hi>Common-wealth.</hi> It was nothing to Vertue or Vice. A bad Man might indifferently take the benefit and ease of his Waies and Bridges, as well as a good; And bad People might purchase good <hi>Charters.</hi> Surely, the better Works of Perpetuity in <hi>Princes,</hi> are those, that <hi>wash the in-side of the Cup.</hi> Such as are <hi>Foundations</hi> of <hi>Colledges,</hi> and <hi>Lectures,</hi> for Learning and Education of youth; Likewise <hi>Foundations</hi> and <hi>Institutions</hi> of <hi>Orders</hi> and <hi>Fraternities,</hi> for Nobleness, Enterprise, and Obedience, and the like. But yet these also, are but like Plantations, of Orchards, and Gardens, in Plots and Spots of Ground, here and there; They do not till over the whole <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and make it fruitful, as doth the Establishing of good <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Ordinances;</hi> Which makes a whole <hi>Nation,</hi> to be as a well ordered <hi>Colledg,</hi> or <hi>Foundation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This kind of Work, in the memory of Times, is rare enough to shew it Excellent; And yet not so rare, as to make it suspected, for Impossible, Inconvenient, or Unsafe. <hi>Moses,</hi> that gave <hi>Laws</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> because he was the Scribe of <hi>God</hi> himself, is fitter to be named for honours sake to other <hi>Law-Givers,</hi> than to be numbred or ranked amongst them. <hi>Minos, Lycurgus,</hi> and <hi>solon,</hi> are Examples for Themes of Grammar Scholars. For ancient Personages, and Characters, now adays, use to wax Children again; Though that <hi>Parable</hi> of <hi>Pindarus</hi> be true; <hi>The best thing is Water.</hi> For Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and Trivial Things are (many times) the best; And rather despised upon Pride, because they are vulgar, than upon Cause, or Use. Certain it is, that the <hi>Laws</hi> of those three <hi>Law-Givers,</hi> had great <hi>Prerogatives.</hi> The first, of <hi>Fame;</hi> Because they were the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:64460:28"/>
Pattern amongst the <hi>Grecians.</hi> The second, of <hi>Lasting;</hi> For they continued longest without alteration. The third; of a <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viver;</hi> To be often oppressed, and often restored.</p>
                  <p>Amongst the seven <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> four were <hi>Law-Givers.</hi> For it is most true, that a <hi>Discourser</hi> of <hi>Italy</hi> saith: <hi>There was never State, so well swadled in the Infancy, as the Roman was, by the vertue of their first Kings:</hi> Which was a principal Cause of the wonderful growth of that <hi>State,</hi> in after times.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Decemvirs Laws,</hi> were <hi>Laws</hi> upon <hi>Laws,</hi> not the Original; For they grafted <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Grecia,</hi> upon <hi>Roman</hi> Stock, of <hi>Laws,</hi> and <hi>Customs.</hi> But such was their success, as the <hi>Twelve Tables,</hi> which they compiled, were the main Body of the <hi>Laws,</hi> which framed and weilded the great Body of that <hi>Estate.</hi> These lasted a long time, with some <hi>Supplementals,</hi> and the <hi>Pretorian Edicts in Albo;</hi> Which were in respect of <hi>Laws,</hi> as Writing <hi>Tables</hi> in respect of Brass; The one to be put in and out, as the other is permanent. <hi>Lucius Cornelius Sylla</hi> reformed the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> For that Man had three Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities, which never <hi>Tyrant</hi> had, but he. That he was a <hi>Law-Giver;</hi> That he took part with the Nobility; And, That he turned Private Man, not upon Fear, but upon Confidence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caefar</hi> long after desired to imitate him only in the First; For otherwise he relied upon new Men: And for resigning his Power, <hi>Seneca</hi> describeth him right: <hi>Caesar gladium citò condidit, nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam posuit. Caesar soon sheathed his Sword, but never put it off.</hi> And himself took it upon him, saying in scorn of <hi>Sylla's</hi> Resignation. <hi>Sylla nescivit literas, dictare non potuit. Sylla knew no letters, he could not dictate.</hi> But for the part of a <hi>Law-Giver, Cicero</hi> giveth him the Attribute. <hi>Caefar, si ab eo quaereretur, quid egisset in Togâ; leges se respondisset, multas &amp; praeclaras tulisse. If you had asked Caesar, what he did in the Gown, he would have answered, that he made many excellent Laws.</hi> His Nephew <hi>Augustus</hi> did tread the same steps, but with deeper print, because of his long Reign in peace; Whereof one of the <hi>Poets</hi> of his time saith;</p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Pace datâ terris, animum ad Civilia vertit:</l>

                  </lg>
                  <p>From that time, there was such a Race of Wit and Authority, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Commentaries</hi> and <hi>Decisions</hi> of the <hi>Lawyers,</hi> and the <hi>Edicts</hi> of the <hi>Emperours,</hi> as both <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Lawyers</hi> were out of breath. Whereupon <hi>Justinian</hi> in the end recompiled both; And made a Body of <hi>Laws,</hi> such as might be weilded; which himself calleth gloriously, and yet not above truth; <hi>The Edifice or Structure of a sacred Temple of Justice;</hi> Built indeed, out of the former <hi>Ruines</hi> of Books, as Materials, and some <hi>Novel Constitutions</hi> of his own.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Athens</hi> they had <hi>Sexviri,</hi> (as <hi>AEschincs</hi> observeth,) which were standing <hi>Commissioners;</hi> Who did watch to discern, what laws waxed unproper for the Times, and what new <hi>Law</hi> did in any
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:64460:29"/>
branch cross a former <hi>Law,</hi> and so <hi>Ex officio</hi> propounded their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>King Edgar</hi> collected the <hi>Laws</hi> of this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and gave them the strength of a Faggot bound, which formerly were dispersed: Which was more glory to him, then his Sailing about this Island, with a potent Fleet. For that was, as the <hi>Scripture</hi> saith, <hi>Via navis in mari; The way of a Ship in the Sea;</hi> It vanished; but this lasteth. <hi>Alphonso</hi> the <hi>Wise,</hi> (the ninth of that Name,) <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Castile,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled the <hi>Digest</hi> of the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> Intituled the <hi>Siete Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das;</hi> An excellent Work, which he finished in seven years. And as <hi>Tacitus</hi> noteth well; That the <hi>Capitol,</hi> though built in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet was fit for the great <hi>Monarchy</hi> that came after; So that <hi>Building</hi> of <hi>Laws</hi> sufficeth the Greatness of the <hi>Empire</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> which since hath ensued.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh had it in his mind, (though he performed it not,) to have made one constant <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>France;</hi> Extracted out of the <hi>Civil Roman Law,</hi> and the <hi>Customs</hi> of <hi>Provinces</hi> which are vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and the <hi>Kings Edicts</hi> which with the <hi>French</hi> are <hi>Statutes.</hi> Surely he might have done well, if, like as he brought the <hi>Crown,</hi> (as he said himself,) from <hi>Page;</hi> So he had brought his <hi>People</hi> from <hi>Lacquay;</hi> Not to run up and down for their <hi>Laws,</hi> to the <hi>Civil Law,</hi> and the Ordinances, and the Customs, and the Discretions of Courts, and discourses of Philosophers, as they use to do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>King Henry</hi> the Eighth, in the twenty seventh year of his Reign, was authorized by <hi>Parliament,</hi> to nominate 32 Commissioners, part Ecclesiastical, and part Temporal; To purge the <hi>Canon Law,</hi> and to make it agreeable to the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>Land.</hi> But it took not effect. <q>For the Acts of that <hi>King</hi> were (commonly) rather Proffers, and Fames, than either well grounded, or well pursued.</q> But I doubt, I erre in producing so many examples. For as <hi>Cicero</hi> said to <hi>Caesar,</hi> so may I say to your Majesty; <hi>Nil vulgare te dignum videri possit.</hi> Though indeed this well understood is far from <hi>Vulgar.</hi> For that the <hi>Laws</hi> of the most <hi>Kingdoms</hi> and <hi>States,</hi> have been like Buildings of many pieces, and patched up, from time to time, according to occasions, without Frame, or Model.</p>
                  <p>Now for the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> (if I shall speak my Opinion of them, without partiality, either to my Profession, or Country,) for the Matter and Nature of them, I hold them Wise, Just, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate <hi>Laws:</hi> They give to <hi>God,</hi> they give to <hi>Caesar,</hi> they give to the <hi>Subject,</hi> what appertaineth. It is true, they are as mixt, as our <hi>Language,</hi> compounded of <hi>British, Roman, Saxon, Danish, Norman Customs.</hi> And surely, as our <hi>Language</hi> is thereby so much the richer; So our <hi>Laws</hi> are likewise by that Mixture, the more compleat.</p>
                  <p>Neither doth this attribute less to them, than those that would have them to have stood out the same in all Mutations. For no Tree is so good first set, as by transplanting, and Grafting. I remember what happened to <hi>Callisthenes,</hi> that followed <hi>Alexanders</hi> Court, and was grown into some displeasure with him, because he could not well brook the <hi>Persian Adoration.</hi> At a Supper, (which with the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:64460:29"/>
                     <hi>Grecians</hi> was a great part Talk,) he was desired, (the <hi>King</hi> being present,) because he was an Eloquent Man, to speak of some Theme; Which he did; And chose for his Theme the praise of the <hi>Macedonian Nation;</hi> Which though it were but a filling Thing, to praise Men to their Faces, yet he performed it with such advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of Truth, and avoidance of Flattery, and with such Life, as was much applauded by the Hearers. The <hi>King</hi> was the less pleased with it, not loving the Man, and by way of discountenance, said; <hi>It was easie to be a good Oratour in a pleasing Theme;</hi> But saith he to him; <hi>Turn your stile; And tell us now of our faults, that we may have the profit, and not you the praise only:</hi> Which he presently did, with such Quickness, that <hi>Alexander</hi> said; <hi>That Malice made him Eloquent then, as the Theme had done before.</hi> I shall not fall into either of these extreams, in this subject, of the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> I have commended them before for the <hi>Matter,</hi> but surely they ask much amendment for the <hi>Form;</hi> Which to reduce and perfect, I hold to be one of the greatest Dowries, that can be confer'd upon this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Which Work, for the Excellency, as it is worthy your <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties</hi> Act, and Times; So it hath some circumstance of Propriety agreeable to your <hi>Person. God</hi> hath blessed your <hi>Majesty</hi> with Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity; And I am not of opinion, that <hi>Kings</hi> that are barren, are fittest to supply Perpetuity of Generations, by perpetuity of Noble Acts; But contrariwise, that they that leave Posterity, are the more interessed in the Care of Future Times; That as well their Progeny, as their People, may participate of their Merit.</p>
                  <p>Your <hi>Majesty</hi> is a great Master in Justice, and Judicature; And it were pity, the fruit of that your Vertue, should not be transmitted to the Ages to come. Your <hi>Majesty</hi> also reigneth in learned times, the more, (no doubt,) in regard of your own perfection in Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and your Patronage thereof. And it hath been the Mishap of <hi>Works</hi> of this Nature, that the less Learned Time, hath (sometimes) wrought upon the more Learned; Which now will not be so. As for my self, the <hi>Law</hi> was my Profession, to which I am a Debter: Some little helps I have of other Arts, which may give Form to Matter; And I have now, (by <hi>Gods</hi> merciful Chastisement, and by his special Providence,) time and leisure, to put my Talent, or half-Talent, or what it is, to such Exchanges, as may perhaps exceed the Interest of an Active Life. Therefore, as in the beginning of my Troubles, I made offer to your <hi>Majesty</hi> to take pains in the <hi>Story</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and in compiling a <hi>Method</hi> and <hi>Digest</hi> of your <hi>Laws;</hi> So have I performed the first, (which rested but upon my self,) in some part; And I do, in all humbleness, renew the offer of this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, (which will require Help and Assistance,) to your <hi>Majesty,</hi> if it shall stand with your good pleasure, to imploy my Service therein.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter the Decease of that Wise and Fortunate <hi>King, Henry</hi> the VII. who died in the Height of his Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, there followed (as useth to do, when the Sun setteth so exceeding clear,) one of the fairest Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> that hath been known in this <hi>Land,</hi> or any where else. A young <hi>King,</hi> about 18 years of Age, for Stature, Strength, Making, and Beauty, one of the goodliest Persons of his time: And though he were given to Pleasure, yet he was likewise desirous of Glory; So that there was a passage open in his Mind, by Glory, for Vertue. Neither was he un-adorned with Learning, though therein he came short of his <hi>Brother Arthur.</hi> He had never any the least Pique, Difference, or Jealousie, with the <hi>King</hi> his <hi>Father,</hi> which might give any occasion, of altering <hi>Court,</hi> or <hi>Counsel</hi> upon the change, but all things passed
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64460:32"/>
in a Still. He was the first Heir of the <hi>White,</hi> and the <hi>Red Rose;</hi> So that there was no discontented Party now left in the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> but all Mens Hearts turned towards him. And not only their Hearts, but their Eyes also. For he was the only Son of the <hi>Kingdom.</hi> He had no <hi>Brother,</hi> which though it be a comfortable thing, for <hi>Kings</hi> to have, yet it draweth the Subjects Eyes a little aside. And yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a married Man in those young years, it promised hope of speedy Issue, to succeed in the <hi>Crown.</hi> Neither was there any <hi>Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> who might share any way in the Government, or clash with his <hi>Counsellours</hi> for Authority, while the <hi>King</hi> intended his pleasure. No such thing, as any Great and Mighty <hi>Subject,</hi> who might any way eclipse, or overshade the <hi>Imperial Power.</hi> And for the people, and <hi>State</hi> in general, they were in such lowness of obedience, as Subjects were like to yield, who had lived almost four and twenty years, under so politique a <hi>King,</hi> as his <hi>Father;</hi> Being also one who came partly in by the Sword; And had so high a Courage in all points of Regalitie; And was ever victorious in Rebellions, and Seditions of the <hi>People.</hi> The <hi>Crown</hi> extreamly rich, and full of Treasure, and the <hi>Kingdom</hi> like to be so in short time. For there was no War, no Dearth, no Stop of Trade, or Commerce, it was only the <hi>Crown,</hi> which had sucked too hard, and now being full, and upon the head of a young <hi>King,</hi> was like to draw less. Lastly, he was Inheriter of his Fathers Reputation, which was great throughout the World. He had streight Alliance, with the two Neighbour States, an ancient Enemy in former times, and an ancient Friend, <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy.</hi> He had Peace and Amity with <hi>France,</hi> under the Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, not only of Treaty and League, but of Necessity and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hability in the <hi>French</hi> to do him hurt, in respect that the <hi>French Kings</hi> Designs were wholly bent upon <hi>Italy.</hi> So that it may be truly said; there had scarcely been seen, or known, in many Ages, such a rare Concurrence of Signs, and Promises of a happy, and flourishing Reign to ensue, as were now met in this young <hi>King,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, after his <hi>Fathers</hi> name, <hi>HENRY</hi> the Eighth, &amp;c.</p>
