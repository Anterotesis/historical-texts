         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

with a few concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
hudled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
during my confinement to my
Chamber by an arreſt from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
my nobler part being then
unwilling to ly idle, when the
other was denyed the liberty of
action: If I have not obſerved
ſo exact a methode as thou
mightst expect, let the diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of my mind by bodily pains
and weakneſs plead my excuſe.
<pb facs="tcp:34098:4"/>
Thou mayeſt wonder perhaps to
meet me walking abroad without
a ſupport, which was not from
any overweening confidence in
my own ability, but becauſe I
was ignorant where to find ſuch
an one as might lend me an hand;
and this, not that I could not have
pick'd out one ſufficient in my
own apprehenſion, but in thine:
For when I conſidered our divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
what animoſities, what
parties, what factions are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us, I knew not where to
elect the man might pleaſe all,
and ſo rather would have none,
than one that might creat a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,
<pb facs="tcp:34098:4"/>
or hinder any from look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into this little Treatiſe of
ſo publick concernment. We are
all paſſengers in the publick Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,
therefore as wiſe Mariners
diligently obſerve the Heavens,
that they may not be taken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided
by Tempeſts: ſo ought
we to enquire what may betide
the Publike, whereon our private
Quiet, and Happineſs depends.
Foreſight is an half-prevention,
and though it may not totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend,
yet will it take off the edge
ſo far, that the evil ſhall not be
able to pierce to the heart: let
this then ſuffice to move thee to
<pb facs="tcp:34098:5"/>
read on, whereby thou ſhalt be
enabled to make a perfect judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whether happineſs, or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity
attends the nation wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
thou art a member. Sol et ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo
generant Hominem, ſay the
Naturaliſts, and Providence,
and Vertue concur in the beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of a perfect and durable
Commonwealth, for divine influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and humane activity are
equally neceſſary to the generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the politick, as well as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Body, and Heaven and
earth muſt join to make up an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
Compoſitum. Obſerve
then both God, and Man, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctings
<pb facs="tcp:34098:5"/>
of Providence towards,
and of Vertue in a Nation, and
thou mayeſt foretell whether it
will be well or ill with them,
without going to a Conjuror, or
any Star-gazing Mountebank.</p>

            <p>This hath cauſed them in all

as the honour confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

            <p>Thus the Jews who had the

from God to enquire of,
yet ranne a madding after wiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards,
and ſuch as had familiar

by hundreds, yea, and ſent to
<hi>Baalzebub</hi> the God of <hi>Ekron,</hi> an
oracle of the Devils, to enquire,
as in the life of <hi>Ahaziah</hi> will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
            <p>With how frequent, and coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:34098:9"/>
the ſullen fiends would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe

what eſteem were the <hi>Sybills</hi>
books among the <hi>Romans,</hi> who
with all other heathens were ſo

they left no ſtone unrol'd to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the knowledge of their

            <p>There could not a Bird chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but there was an <hi>Augur</hi> to

            <p>There could not a Bird flye,
but there was an <hi>Auſpex</hi> to watch
it; nor light, but he was ready to
obſerve, and by its motions in
the ayr interpret the revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of States and Perſons.</p>
            <p>There could not a ſacrifice
fall, but there was an <hi>Aruſpex</hi> to
behold the poſture of it, and by
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:34098:10"/>
the quietneſſe or ſtrugling of
the ſenſitive creature, to foretell
the facilities or reluctancies in
the affairs of rational beings;
and an <hi>Exſpex</hi> to conſult the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails,
and by the colour of the
inwards tell the complexion of
outward affairs.</p>
            <p>There could not a line ſeem
to be ſcribled on the hand, but
there was a <hi>Chiromancer</hi> to read
them, and with his interlineary
gloſſes expound them, giving a
ſhort Synopſis of the future
paſſages of this preſent life out
of that <hi>Enchiridion</hi> (as they
would have it) of natures pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Interpreter</hi> of Dreames
was ſet to judge in the horny

if the day were to receive light
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34098:10"/>
from the night, to regulate its

of which the nations were ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured,
the heaven it ſelf could

with his key was to unlock

            <p>And here let me not be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,
for I am not of opinion
that thoſe glorious bodies were
created only to twinckle in a

this along with you, that God

often in text-hand declares his

and other fiery apparitions, as
he did before the laſt deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

            </p>
            <p>And as the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi>

in Gods revealed will; God will
have his children in ſome ſenſe

them, that he might keep them
in a waiting and obedient po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,

and expectation; not
that I would have them with

            <p>I confeſſe with that kingly
Prophet, that Gods wayes are
unſearchable, and his paths
paſt finding out, that is in the
hidden and ſecret bringing of
things about, yet in his out-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
he will be obſerved, that
his glory, his power, his juſtice,
and his mercy may be made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
unto the children of men;
thus we find his mighty works
of creation, and redemption, of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:34098:13"/>
preſervation, and caſtigation, all
along recorded in the ſacred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſters
of the old and new Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taments;
and that for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
as well as inſtruction of his
people; in the writings of thoſe
glorious ſtars, the ſacred Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
may the Saints read their
fortunes, and with comfort ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
unto themſelves the divine
diſpenſations of God to his
people.</p>
            <p>Hath God brought <hi>England</hi>
through a red ſea of war out of
Egyptian bondage, and will he
not perfect his work? is the
mighty hand of omnipotencie
ſhortned that it cannot ſave?
or the loving kindneſſe of the
immutable Deity changed that
he will not ſave? though the
murmurers (thoſe repiners at
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:34098:13"/>
Gods hand, who would upon
beds of down, with all eaſe and
plenty be carried through the
wilderneſſe) may be cut off, and
thoſe low ſoules whom the
height of the ſons of <hi>Anak</hi> hath
cauſed to rebell againſt the moſt
high be conſumed; and who
knows whether for their ſakes
he hath not deferred to ſettle
us in the promiſed land? yet
ſhal the <hi>Caleb</hi>'s and <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s who
have followed God fully be
brought into it, and their ſeed
ſhal poſſeſſe it; though God
may defer his mercies becauſe
of ſome mens infidelity, yet in
his good time he will accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh
them, if his people walk
worthy of them. Let us not then
deſpair, nor be impatient, but
endeavour to fit our ſelves to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:34098:14"/>
receive them; for the wiſe God,
and our merciful Father knows
better what is good for us than
our ſelves, his time is beſt, but
let us from the bottom of our
hearts eccho to that petition
in the Goſpel, <hi>Thy will be done on
earth as it is in beaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I ſhal not inſiſt further in
applying Scripture, and I could
wiſh ſome (I am perſuaded
Godly perſons) had not been

miſapplying it; for ſurely if we

<hi>Ireland;</hi> were not ſome peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily

            </p>
            <p>So if we behold the book of

for matters in fact are as certain

            <p>And Peace it fills the barns,

home, it may rain and ſhine, and
that together.</p>
            <p>Yet let the drums bellow too

break in on all ſides, and like a

            <p>Or let a long calm come what
ſloath, what luxury, what effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatneſs
and cowardice doth
it create? how doth it enervate
the members, clog the ſpirits,
cauſe the blood to putrifie, and
corrupt, and beget that lazy and
ſcurvy diſeaſe which makes the
whole body to draw a faint,
ſickly, inglorious, yea, a noiſom

            <p>The <hi>Aſſyrian, Caldaean,</hi> and

            <p>And now, when all their ſayls
were fill'd with the proſperous
gales of fortune, and there was
none but vail'd and ſtoopt unto
them, on a ſudden being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calm'd,
an effeminate <hi>Sardana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palus,</hi>
a drunken <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi>
and a luxurious <hi>Darius,</hi> put a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
to their greatneſſs; ſo eaſie
it is to tumble down hill.</p>
            <p>Thus the Roman Monarchy
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:34098:21"/>
fell to pieces, and became a prey
to barbarous nations, yet out
of its aſhes aroſe a Phenix, a
maiden Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth, which
hath preſerv'd her beauty as
well as virginity for twelve
hundred years without wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckle
or blemiſh, and hath ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
foild the <hi>Ottoman</hi> forces, to
whom the Grecian Empire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a prey with little difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
ſo potent is vertue even in

            <p>Thus a few Fiſher-Towns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:34098:21"/>
and from poor diſtreſſed States
are grown <hi>Hogen-Mogens</hi> with
the help of <hi>England,</hi> for which
they have ſince well rewarded
us. But let them take heed leſt
their High and Mightineſſes be
not brought as low as their ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation,
being grown reſty with
their former little ſucceſſes,
Peace, and Plenty, and by their
treacherous ingratitude made
their beſt friend their enemy, to
whom they are as much inferior
in true valour, as they ſurpaſſe
in Pride, Arrogancy, Trechery,
and Cruelty.</p>
            <p>Yea, to come home, how il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious,
and famous did this
nation grow in the dayes of
Queen <hi>Elizabeth?</hi> What noble
Acts? What generous ſpirits did
it bring forth? What ſupplies
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:34098:22"/>
did it afford the <hi>Netherlands?</hi>
What an help was it to <hi>France,</hi>
and what a Scourge and terror

whoſe <hi>Armado</hi> ſtiled <hi>Invincible</hi>

reſolutely, and with a courage
not unworthy the nobility of

then disdaining to wear the

onely could afford it a longer

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:34098:32"/>
ſo contemptible were they in

            <p>Yet this remedy ſeemed as

was more valiant, and what

who were ſo ſtrict in their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
worſhip, that they would
chooſe rather to lay themſelves
open to their enemies arms,
than by omitting the leaſt
part of it, to their Gods diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure:
an eminent example of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:34098:46"/>
which we have in that war of
the <hi>Gauls</hi> which ſucceeded the
firſt Punick, in which when
<hi>Flaminius</hi> and <hi>Furius</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls
were gone againſt the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
with great Forces, the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurs</hi>
having found that ſome
things were omitted in their
election, They were comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by letters from the <hi>Senate</hi>
to return preſently and abjure
their offices, which Letters <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius</hi>
not opening until he had
fought and routed the Enemy,
and made a memorable invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their Countrey, though he
returned crowned with victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and laden with ſpoil, not
one went out to meet him, nay
he had much ado to obtain a
Triumph, (which was no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
paſt, but both He and his
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:34098:46"/>
Collegue were conſtrained to
lay aſide their Conſulſhips) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he ſeemed to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned
&amp; made ſlight of their
holy Rites; they eſteeming it
more conducing to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſafety that their Gods
ſhould be obſerved, than their
Enemies overcome, and rather
chooſing to leave their Armies
without Commanders, though
in a war reputed ſo dangerous
as that of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> in which
their Prieſts were not exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from bearing Arms, than
omit the leaſt Punctilio in
their worſhip, ſo zealous and
tender were they in matters
concerning their Religion.
Thus when they were beſieged
by the <hi>Gauls</hi> in the <hi>Capitol,</hi> and
the day approached wherein
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:34098:47"/>
their ſolemn Sacrifice was to be
performed in <hi>Colle Quirinali,</hi> the
Hill ſo called, rather than to
omit their duty to Heaven,
they ventured through the
very midſt of their Enemies
Camp, and having performed
their Rites, returned with ſafety,
their Enemies either being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed
at the boldneſſe of the
Attempt, or mooved with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to Religion, which preſent
death could not deter them
from performing.</p>
            <p>And though their Religion
were idolatrous, yet according
to their light being zealous they
reaped the reward of a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
proſperity: which ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them deſpiſing, ſmarted
for to the purpoſe, in their own
ruin reaping the reward of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:34098:47"/>
their Impiety and contempt of
Religion: Thus we ſhall ſee
<hi>Craſſus</hi> who ſlighting the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes

<hi>Ateius,</hi> would make war
upon the <hi>Parthians,</hi> where he
loſt his own and his ſons life,
with moſt of his Army, the poor
remainder eſcaping by a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
flight: and thus <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>
the great, who would, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the intreaties and
diſwafions of the High-Prieſt,
enter the Holy of Holies in the
Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in his
comming out fell down, and
never after proſpered, but being
overthrown by <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> loſt his head,
his body being left unburied on
the ſands: and though he were
no <hi>Jew,</hi> yet being a <hi>Roman</hi> by

to ſhew his ſtrength in their

by <hi>Omnipotency,</hi> would ſink

though theſe may ſeem weak,

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:34098:58"/>
through the power of God that
ſtrengthens them, and are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
ſupplyed from above
with what gifts and graces
ſoever are neceſſary for them:
Thus the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> being poor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
<hi>Fiſhermen,</hi> and the like,
once called, and inveſted with
the <hi>Apoſtleſhip,</hi> were endued
from above, had the gift of
<hi>Tongues,</hi> immediately were
taught by the <hi>Holy Ghost:</hi> and
who dares affirm them <hi>unlearned</hi>
then? or deny ſkill in the <hi>tongues</hi>
neceſſary for the office of a <hi>Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,</hi>
which God, who doth
nothing in vain, by <hi>Miracle</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
upon them? And what
now though they wanted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<hi>Learning,</hi> ſo they had it
infuſed? and God was pleaſed
in that extraordinary time, in an
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:34098:59"/>
extraordinary manner to endow
them, muſt we therefore now
neglect the ordinary means,
and tempt God to work a <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi>
to be able to anſwer a Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayer?
but let us but conſider
how faithful an handmaid <hi>lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>
hath been to <hi>religion;</hi> how
the <hi>Armor-bearer</hi> hath helped
<hi>Jonathan</hi> to deſtroy the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimes;</hi>
how neceſſary it hath
been to maintain <hi>Religion,</hi> and
oppoſe <hi>Idolatry;</hi> by the help of
<hi>Learning</hi> have the <hi>Ministery</hi> of
<hi>England</hi> been enabled to defend
the <hi>truth,</hi> and oppoſe <hi>errour,</hi>
to ward off, and put by the
blowes and thruſts of their <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian</hi>

ſtrike with the edge, and give
them the true point, to the
wounding &amp; deſtroying of their
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:34098:59"/>
ſuperſtitious tenents. Thus we
ſee the learned <hi>Whitacre</hi> diſarm
their <hi>Goliah,</hi> confute their <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi>
foyl their choſen <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion,</hi>

beat him from outwork to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work,
from ſconce to ſconce,
till he hath driven him out of all
his ſtrengths, and left him not
a lurking hole to hide his head
in; when the moſt that we could
expect from a <hi>Dean of Dunſtable</hi>
could be <hi>Bellarmine</hi> thou lyeſt,
neither ſhewing ſenſe or reaſon,
but his ſay ſo. But it may be
ſaid, thank a good cauſe: yet
may the beſt cauſe be ſpoiled
by an evil mannaging, and the
moſt bright and ſhining <hi>truths</hi>
be obſcured in a dark <hi>Lanthorn,</hi>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:34098:60"/>
yea let them be whiter than
<hi>Snow,</hi> they may be ſullied by dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
fingers, and more tranſparent
than <hi>glaſs,</hi> yet may be cracked
when clumſie fiſts ſhall come to
handle them. This the <hi>Jeſuites</hi>
know, which hath been the
cauſe of this ſtrange attempt,
for it is moſt plain by the <hi>poyſon</hi>
now vomited, that ſome of
thoſe <hi>Serpents</hi> are wriggled in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt

our weapons, and to their ſmart
know the ſharpneſs of them, no

               <p>An anſwer to ſome objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
learning, in a book enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled,
The Saints Guide.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <hi>ANd the ſame Author goes
on,</hi> Nor is any nation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſome turbulent ſpirits of its
own, the diſhonour of the gown,
and pulpit, the ſhame, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ruin of their Countrey; <hi>one
of which hath late ſtarted this
queſtion,</hi> Whether or not all that
much magnifyed natural reaſon
(which we think dignifieth us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
and diſtinguiſheth us from
Brutes) and all that humane lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
(which we conceive exalts and
rectifyeth reaſon) be the fruit of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:34098:62"/>
the forbidden tree, and is a ſpurious
and adventious faculty, which
man wanted in his innocency, and
was inſtilled into him by Satan in
the fall?</p>
            <p>A quaery Satan himſelf might
bluſh to put, and yet the Book
ſtuffed with this and the like
doctrine, is cloathed with the
ſpecious title of the <hi>Saints Guide;</hi>
the <hi>Wolf</hi> adorns himſelf with
the <hi>Lambs</hi> ſkinne, the <hi>Fiend</hi>
transforms himſelf into an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel</hi>
of light: it is not amiſſe to
mark the phraſe he reproaches
learning in, then how he couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his doctrine, laſtly his <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity</hi>
in theſe words, <hi>which man
wanted in his innocency.</hi> Indeed
the old <hi>Serpent</hi> told <hi>Eve</hi> that the
fruit of the forbidden tree would
encreaſe their <hi>Knowledge,</hi> but
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:34098:62"/>
except him, and this <hi>Diſciple</hi> of
his, I never found any affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that man wanted any thing
in his <hi>Innocency:</hi> but ſuppoſe
this diabolical doctrine true, if
man wanted <hi>Learning</hi> before, he
much more wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts it ſince the fall;
the Author of ſuch ſtuff may
well cry out againſt <hi>reaſon</hi> and
<hi>Learning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to the queſtion, That
<hi>Reaſon</hi> was depraved and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the <hi>fall,</hi> we allow, and
that by the help of <hi>learning</hi> it is
in ſome meaſure reſtored, we
affirm, and ſo conſequently that
there had been no need of acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>learning</hi> had man ſtood, no
more would there of <hi>repentance:</hi>
but doth it follow therefore,
that now vve are fallen, vve
ſhould not labour for <hi>repentance?</hi>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:34098:63"/>
Let this fellow go and try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he can perſwade a man that
is fallen into a pit not to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to get out, becauſe getting
out is a fruit, and effect of his
falling in. Truly ſuch arguing
is inſtilled by <hi>Satan,</hi> and ſuch
<hi>Sophistry</hi> is a baſtardly <hi>faculty</hi>
which <hi>ingenuity,</hi> much more
<hi>innocency,</hi> is ſo far from want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that it abhors and deteſts it.
The <hi>Fellow</hi> ſeems to be a Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
I ſhall aſk him therefore
one queſtion. Is not reaſon the
ſpecifical difference of a <hi>man</hi>
from a <hi>Beast?</hi> and was <hi>man</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed
from a <hi>Beaſt</hi> by the
<hi>fall,</hi> or the <hi>Creation?</hi> Did the
<hi>Devil</hi> or <hi>God</hi> make him a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
creature? Behold then the
horrid <hi>blaſphemy</hi> couched in this
query, which would inſinuate
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:34098:63"/>
the <hi>rational ſoul</hi> to be the <hi>product</hi>
of the <hi>Devil;</hi> if this be not a
doctrine of <hi>Devils</hi> I know not
what is.</p>
            <p>Then for his Parentheſis,
(<hi>which we think dignifieth us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
and diſtinguiſheth us from
Brutes</hi>) if <hi>Reaſon</hi> doth not, what
doth? <hi>ſhape</hi> cannot, for ſo one
<hi>Beaſt</hi> differs from another:
neither is it <hi>Grace,</hi> for
then all but <hi>Beasts</hi> muſt have
<hi>Grace:</hi> And for his other (<hi>which
we conceive exalts, and rectifies
reaſon</hi>) hath not <hi>learning</hi> exalted
and rectified his <hi>reaſon</hi> ſo far as
to enable him from ſuch and
ſuch Premiſſes to draw ſuch a
and ſuch a Concluſion, to frame
his <hi>Syllogiſms,</hi> to write and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
theſe words, <hi>poſitions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſectaries,
quaeries, reſponſions,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:34098:64"/>
cognition,</hi> which his <hi>illiterate</hi>
auditors and readers underſtand
no more, than they do him and
his drifts? what but <hi>learning</hi>
hath ſet his underſtanding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
theirs, and enabled him
to talk at a rate his <hi>ignorant</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
onely can <hi>admire?</hi> Behold
then you miſled <hi>wretches</hi> what
a <hi>Guide</hi> you have got, who when
all his <hi>Sophiſtry,</hi> and abuſe of
his own <hi>reaſon</hi> and <hi>learning,</hi> all
his <hi>Logick</hi> and <hi>Syllogiſms</hi> are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to overthrow <hi>reaſon</hi> and
<hi>learning,</hi> goes about by his <hi>que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
to undermine them; who,
when all his <hi>impudency</hi> dares not
affirm, and all his ability can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
prove, endeavors by way
off doubt to inſtill his <hi>poiſon,</hi>
upon hopes that you will ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
&amp; take ſor granted whatever
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:34098:64"/>
drops from him: what is it you
admire in this <hi>Fellow,</hi> is it his
railing againſt <hi>learning</hi> in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?
doth he not make uſe of
it himſelf? he diſputes <hi>Syllogiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,</hi>
he is frequent in <hi>diviſion,</hi>
abounds in ſubtill and ſophiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<hi>distinctions,</hi> talks hard words,
rattles out <hi>Latine,</hi> nay there is
not one <hi>Arrow</hi> in his quiver but
is feathered with feathers pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from <hi>learnings</hi> wing, nor is
he able to ſpeak or write, or you
to read or underſtand one ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
word or ſentence againſt
<hi>Learning,</hi> but by its aſſiſtance.
Could you have read, could you
have wrote, could you have
underſtood one word had you
not been taught? why theſe are
degrees of <hi>learning;</hi> awake and
behold the <hi>cheat,</hi> which would
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:34098:65"/>
make you enemies even to that
<hi>image</hi> of <hi>God</hi> which is imprinted
on you, level you with <hi>Brutes</hi>
nay make you ſuch: you ſee it
is reaſon that diſtinguiſheth a

that improves <hi>reaſon,</hi> be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of being <hi>rational;</hi> this

the eaſier deſtroy your <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity;</hi>
rob you of your <hi>reaſon,</hi>
to bob you of your <hi>religion:</hi> For
if he be not a very <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> yet is
he the likeſt one that ever I met
with; if the tree may be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the fruits, his acts will
a loud proclaim him a notorious
juggler: and firſt behold how
he cheats you in ſtating the <hi>que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,</hi>
for it is not whether by
the help of humane learning a
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:34098:65"/>
man may attain a ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to himſelf, whether he
can ſave his own <hi>soul;</hi> but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he may not attain to ſuch a
knowledge as may enable him
to hold out the way of <hi>Salvation</hi>
unto others: and that a man
may do this, not only too too
frequent <hi>examples</hi> do make out,
but the Apoſtle himſelf tells us
in the 1 Cor. 9. 27. <hi>But I keep un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
my body, and keep it in ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
lest that by any means, when
I have preached unto others, I my
ſelf ſhould be a cast away; a</hi>
man may preach to others, and
yet be himſelf a <hi>caſt away:</hi> for
this wretch dares not affirm that
the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> inſpired by the <hi>Spirit</hi>
of <hi>God</hi> would ſuppoſe an <hi>impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility:</hi>
and the example of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
clearly ſhewes that a man
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:34098:66"/>
may have an outward call to
teach, and yet be a reprobate;
was not he one of the <hi>twelve</hi> that
was ſent to <hi>preach the Kingdome
of God, and to heal the ſick?</hi> Luk.
9. 1, 2. alſo the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in the
2 Tim. 3. 5. ſpeaks of ſome, <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a form of Godlineſs, creeping
into houſes, leading captive ſilly wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
laden with infirmities:</hi> Theſe
<hi>Hypocrites</hi> by the help of <hi>learning</hi>
and <hi>parts</hi> could pray as devout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
talk as holily, wreſt the

the dy, making the word
ſpeak what they liſt, craftily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
it, having all the arts and
methodes of <hi>conſenage,</hi> even as
he himſelf; yet were they not
taught of <hi>God;</hi> it is cleer ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that <hi>learning</hi> and <hi>parts perſe
ex propria natura</hi> can underſtand
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:34098:66"/>
and ſo apprehend the myſtery of
the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> as to hold it out ſo
to others, that the hearers cannot

You may behold alſo how finely

Arguments, for unleſs he prove

cannot attain to ſuch a

nothing.</p>
            <p>And that this <hi>Sophiſtry</hi> is
malicious, not ignorant, his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
two objections will ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
clear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 1. That though hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
learning be an enemy to the
law of God while it is in an unſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:34098:67"/>
heart, yet when the heart
is truly turned to God, then it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a ſanctifyed instrument,
and a good hundmaid to Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solution. To this he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers,</hi>
That though the heart be
truly ſanctified, in which humane
learning doth inhere as in its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
yet doth it not follow that
learning it ſelf is, no more than
ſin can be ſaid to be ſanctified,
though the heart of a ſinful man
may be truly ſaid to be ſanctifyed:
for acquired learning of it ſelf, and
of its own nature, is nothing elſe
but ſin, and therefore remains ſo
ſtill, and cannot be truly nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
ſaid to be ſanctifyed, no more
than ſin. But if by being ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
they mean that the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential
wiſdome of God doth order
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:34098:67"/>
it, or make uſe of it for the good of
his people, I oppoſe it not, ſo that
it be underſtood, that that good
flowes not ſrom the nature of acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
knowledge it ſelf, but from
the wiſdome and goodneſs of the
Spirit of God, who maketh all
things work together for the benefit
of thoſe that love him, who are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
according to his purpoſe, and
ſo no more can properly in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
be predicated of it than of ſin
it ſelf, which in that caſe
(though not as an entity, for
<hi>non entia ad modum entium
concipiuntur</hi>) is ſaid alſo to
work for the good of Gods Saints.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt to this we ſay, that the</hi>
habit <hi>of</hi> ſin <hi>is deſtroyed, there
is a</hi> mortification <hi>of</hi> ſin, <hi>as well
as a</hi> vivification <hi>of</hi> grace, <hi>as</hi> Rom.
6. 2. How ſhall we that are dead to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:34098:68"/>
ſin, live any longer therein? <hi>and
Epheſ.</hi> 2. 1. You hath he quickned
who were dead in treſpaſſes and
ſins. <hi>Now the habit of</hi> learning
<hi>is not in the leaſt diminiſhed,
much leſs deſtroyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, That the whole
man with all his endowments is
ſanctified, as</hi> 1 Theſ. 5. 23, 24.
And the very God of peace ſanctify
you wholly, and I pray God your
whole ſpirit, and ſoul, and body, be
preſerved blameleſs unto the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.
Faithful is he that calleth you, who
alſo will do it. <hi>Now then, either</hi>
learning <hi>muſt be ſanctified, or
ſomething remains unſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, That acquired <hi>lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi>
of it ſelf, and of its own
nature is not <hi>ſin,</hi> for <hi>ſin</hi> is a
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:34098:68"/>

<hi>ſanctification,</hi> making <hi>the holy

fighting with his own <hi>ſhadow,</hi>
and keeping a coil about no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:34098:69"/>
for the very objection,

the good to flow from the <hi>ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification</hi>

comes to his Concluſion, which
how true it is, as it ſufficiently
appears by what is ſaid, yet will
be more manifeſt if we conſider
<hi>learning</hi> in it ſelf to be <hi>indifferent</hi>

as it is uſed or abuſed, now is
<hi>ſin</hi> ſo? Suppoſe a man ſhall

            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 2. Again, if it be
objected, that though learning be
not effectual to the understanding
of the myſtery of the Goſpel, yet it is
prealent to the compleating of the
literal and hiſtorical knowledge
thereof: <hi>Take this here, that
theſe objections are of his own

own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solution. To this he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers.</hi>
Though it may conduce to
the gaining of literal, and histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:34098:70"/>
knowledge, yet this is not <hi>ad
idem,</hi> becauſe it profiteth nothing;
For truth it ſelf bears record, It is
the Spirit that quickneth, the fleſh
profitteth nothing; and men are
made able Miniſters of the New
Testament, not of the Letter, but
of the Spirit; For the letter killeth,
but the Spirit giveth life. So that
all literal and historical knowledge
gained by mans power, is but like
the principle from whence it ſlowed,
fleſhly, earthly, deadly, and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive.</p>
            <p>To this we ſay, that what he
ſaith here againſt <hi>learning,</hi> may
as well be ſaid againſt reading,
<hi>teaching,</hi> and <hi>hearing,</hi> there muſt
be fit and outward <hi>Organs,</hi> there
muſt be <hi>eyes, a tongue,</hi> and <hi>eares,</hi>
and theſe muſt have a <hi>body</hi> to
ſubſiſt; is all <hi>reading, hearing,</hi>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:34098:71"/>
and <hi>teaching</hi> therefore like the
<hi>principle</hi> from whence they flow,
<hi>fleſhly, earthly, deadly,</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive?</hi>
Behold then whether
theſe Scriptures are wreſted or
no? do you think they are to
be underſtood to condemn all
outward means, or onely to
ſhew that <hi>outward means</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

like <hi>Temperance</hi> then <hi>drunkennes,</hi>
and this our <hi>Reaſon</hi> will inſtruct

perſwade for the moſt part
to avoid the <hi>exceſs,</hi> as of more

indeed it would be more facile

a <hi>drunkard</hi> from his <hi>tipple</hi>

you ſee how ſoon he broke

The latter phraſe is very

come to be fit for any high, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

Thus the muck worm

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>efficient cauſe</hi> of vertue
is <hi>cuſtome;</hi> which is the genuine
Parent of an habit; thus when
we ſee a man wallow in vice, we
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:34098:87"/>
say he is habituated to it, yet
have there been ſome who have
endeavoured to alter this <hi>Pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Gallen</hi> a Phyſician, would

place it within the verge of his

whoſe <hi>ſhop</hi> alas can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

or the <hi>corrupt, Juſt;</hi> and let

and his ruined <hi>Shrines</hi> be
repaired for his ſervice. I confeſs
they can make the <hi>Miſer</hi> open
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:34098:88"/>
his fiſt, and ſcatter his <hi>Angells,</hi>
when he is terrifyed with the

This wretch, contrary to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who hold faſteſt when
in danger of drowning, unclut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching

with his <hi>Mammon,</hi> his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
Deity ſo long adored by
him, when the <hi>Devil</hi> appears
ready to ceize him. But this is
but like the <hi>Cowards</hi> winking
and laying about him when
there is no remedy but fight or

            <p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:34098:88"/>
Thus it ſeems, making for
his profeſſion, <hi>Gallen</hi> attempts
to cry up his own <hi>Diana,</hi> and
on <hi>Nature</hi> beget a Sire for <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi>
for he will have it ſpring
from a <hi>Temperament</hi> of the <hi>Body;</hi>
but though this may encline,
yet doth it not neceſſarily draw
men to vertue.</p>
            <p>1. For we often ſee <hi>manners</hi>
changed, the <hi>temperament</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
the ſame, as in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of <hi>Themiſtocles;</hi> and the
<hi>temper</hi> changed, the <hi>manners</hi>
continuing, for in the life of
<hi>Marius</hi> we read, that though he
was both old, groſs, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulent,
yet did he daily in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
exerciſe himſelf in arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the young men, endeavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to make his body active
and nimble whether <hi>nature</hi>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:34098:89"/>
would or no: yea ſo fiery and
young was his <hi>ambition</hi> that the
chill froaſt of age which had
made his head hoary could not
nip it, and ſuch a thirſt after
honour burned within him,
that ſix <hi>Conſulſhips</hi> adorn'd with
the moſt-ſplendid <hi>tryumphs</hi>
could not quench it, but his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring
<hi>ſoul</hi> would have drawn
his unweldie <hi>body</hi> craz'd with
age, and loaden with <hi>honour,</hi>
after it into <hi>Pontus,</hi> whether
he eagerly ſought to be ſent
Commander in chief againſt
<hi>Mithridates;</hi> yea upon his death
bed when he was <hi>light headed,</hi>
fancying he was warring againſt
<hi>Mithridates,</hi> he would often
uſe ſuch poſtures, and motions
of the body, as became a <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi>
backed with a loud, and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:34098:89"/>
military clamour: Alas poor

could have given thee content,
which in a whole <hi>Grove</hi> thou
couldſt not find, though
ſpringing from thine own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts.</p>
            <p>2. Again the temper is not in
our power, <hi>manners</hi> are, for if
they were not, to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
would deliberation, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,
exhortation, praiſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof,
laws, rewards, puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
be? it is evident then
that the <hi>Temperament</hi> is not the
proximate and chief cauſe of
<hi>vertue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, And as <hi>Gallen,</hi> ſo
the <hi>Stoicks</hi> make <hi>Nature</hi> the
cauſe of <hi>vertue,</hi> which they hold
born with man, but <hi>vice</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to <hi>Nature</hi> and acquired by
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:34098:90"/>
evil cuſtom. So that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

cauſe of the acquired <hi>habit</hi> of
<hi>vice,</hi> which grants our <hi>Tenent,</hi>
for having proved <hi>vertue</hi> to be a
<hi>habit</hi> acquired, not an innate <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,</hi>
it muſt be the product of
<hi>cuſtome.</hi> Beſides, whatever is
<hi>natural</hi> is <hi>immoveable,</hi> but <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>
are mutable, as in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

and how often have

            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Some there are
that aſcribe <hi>vertues</hi> original to
<hi>education,</hi> and <hi>breeding,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:34098:90"/>
this is very much condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
to beget the firſt acts of
<hi>vertue,</hi> and to put youth in
the right road to come to it, but
it is not of force to creat the <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit:</hi>
for how many do we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
excellently initiated in
this ſacred <hi>myſtery</hi> by a good
<hi>Tutorage,</hi> which when they
come to have the reigns layd in
their necks, gallop down hill,
and break the neck of all thoſe
goodly expectations? for
the beſt inſtilled precepts
though they may ſometimes
check, yet are they not of
force to ſtop the carreer of the
headſtrong affections, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
are there, who can give good
counſel to others, which they
cannot or will not follow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
But let me not be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtood,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:34098:91"/>
for though we do
not allow <hi>education</hi> to be the
<hi>proximate</hi> and <hi>adaequate,</hi> yet
ſhall we not deny it to be a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
cauſe,</hi> which by entering
men in vertues path, which gon
on in will bring to the habit,
may be ſaid to lay the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to this glorious <hi>Fabrick.</hi>
And thus though we cannot in
<hi>juſtice</hi> conferre the <hi>Crown</hi> as to
have reached the <hi>Goal,</hi> yet let it
carry the <hi>prize</hi> for the firſt <hi>start;</hi>
though we muſt deny it the
<hi>tryumph</hi> due to an abſolute vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
yet ſhall we put the <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Crown</hi> on its head, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
firſt mounted the <hi>Wall,</hi> and
firſt erected <hi>vertues Enſign</hi> upon

not be neglected, but of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
its due eſteem, as the moſt

excellent <hi>Trayner</hi> up of youth,
the moſt noble <hi>File-leader,</hi> who

us above the reach of any <hi>enemy,</hi>
carry us out of <hi>Fortunes gun-ſhot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the reſt enjoying what
is their own, let us give <hi>Cuſtom</hi>
its due, which is to be the <hi>effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
cauſe</hi> of <hi>vertue,</hi> enabling
men by an often <hi>repetition</hi> of
ſuch or ſuch a vertuous <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>

can we think the repugnancies

from the word which ſignifieth
<hi>cuſtome,</hi> may confirm us that it
hath its original from the thing

            </p>
            <p>But now to preſcribe a ſet
number, to tell how many acts
go to the making up an habit, is
impoſſible; for 1. fewer or more
are requiſite, accordingly as
the mind is leſs or more enclin'd
to <hi>vertue.</hi> 2. Some acts are more
powerful, others leſs valid. 3.
Attention makes large amends
for number, whoſe worth, by
way of exchange, may viewith
hundreds, and, when put in the
ſcale, far outweigh them. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
let any of us fear to overdo,
to act vertuouſly too often.</p>
            <p>The external cauſes of <hi>vertue</hi>

            <p>The <hi>end</hi> of <hi>vertue,</hi> is <hi>bonum

            <p>Of the firſt, <hi>Piety,</hi> we have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready

neceſſary to enable us in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

we find it termed by the

were the <hi>Antients</hi> that it
might not be ſo much as menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned

And indeed it is the very <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract</hi>

the <hi>ci<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<hi>center</hi> in which they meet; it is
the <hi>ſalt</hi> that ſeaſons them, and
the <hi>ſoul</hi> that informs them, that
beſtowes their glorious being.
Without this, <hi>Prudence</hi> would be
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:34098:94"/>
but <hi>cunning. Juſtice,</hi> in <hi>execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
but a more ſpecious and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved

Fortitude,</hi> but a brutiſh
<hi>audacity,</hi> and daring <hi>raſhneſs</hi> to
render our ſelves <hi>terrible,</hi> and
gain <hi>Domination. Temperance,</hi>
but a kind of <hi>ſenſleſnes</hi> and <hi>ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity,</hi>
a <hi>Stoical</hi> piece of <hi>tyranny
over our bodies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence grew its eſteem among
the <hi>Moralists,</hi> which generally
make the other vertues ſpring
from the pregnant womb of
<hi>Probitie;</hi> and hence came it to
be honored among the <hi>Romans,</hi>
which they beheld bleſſed with
ſo glorious and numerous a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny,</hi>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:34098:95"/>

            </p>
            <p>This was it ſet <hi>Numa</hi> on the

Country life to govern
<hi>Rome,</hi> paſſing by the moſt noble
among both <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines.</hi>
It was this fetched <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranus</hi>
from the <hi>Plough,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned
him with the abſolute &amp;
uncontrollable power of <hi>Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</hi>
This encouraged them to
elect <hi>Cato</hi> to be <hi>Cenſor,</hi> and paſs
by the nobleſt <hi>Competitors,</hi>
when inſtead of courting the
<hi>people,</hi> he ſeemed to threaten
them, proclaming, that by
chooſing him and <hi>Valerius Flac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi>
whom they alſo made his
<hi>Collegue,</hi> the <hi>City</hi> might be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
of its new corruptions, and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:34098:95"/>
antient probity of manners re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored.
This made <hi>Fabritius,</hi>
when the <hi>Phyſician</hi> sent him
word, that if he pleaſed he
would poiſon <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> return
the <hi>Letter</hi> to <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> with this
exprobration, That he was
moſt unfortunate in his choice
of friends, as well as enemies;
which when <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and hanging his <hi>Phyſician,</hi>
returned the <hi>Roman Captives</hi>
without ranſom, <hi>Fabritius</hi> ſent
as many captives of his with
this admonition, that he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
the <hi>Treaſon</hi> not for any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
or reſpect he bore to him,
but to let him know that the
<hi>Romans</hi> abhorred by <hi>treachery</hi> to
deſtroy their enemies. <hi>Pyrrhus</hi>
had then invaded <hi>Italy,</hi> had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown
the Conſul <hi>Laevinus,</hi>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:34098:96"/>
and was grown numerous by
the revolt of many of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Italy</hi> who lackied to his
<hi>Fortune;</hi> his <hi>Phyſician</hi> unſought
to, even of his own accord, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
to rid them of this <hi>danger,</hi>
yet ſo great was their love to
<hi>honeſty,</hi> they choſe to undergo
any hazard, rather than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nive
at a <hi>diſhoneſt act,</hi> or in the
leaſt to bear with it though in
a <hi>Stranger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Behold <hi>O Matchivilian,</hi> this is
that which truly eſtabliſhes a
<hi>State,</hi> when thy unworthy <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies,</hi>
though they may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous
for a while, are never
long-lived, and thy rotten
props will in the cloſe fail thee,
and bury thee in the ruins of
that thou buildeſt upon them.
Produce me an example, where
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:34098:96"/>
although <hi>Proſperity</hi> might lead
the Van, reproach and ruine
did not bring up the Rear?
where thy <hi>villanies</hi> flouriſhing
for a day, were not froſt-nipt
at night? where though they
might bud in the morning, and
blow at noon, they were
not blaſted in the evening, and
their purple changed into ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
their roſie-tinctured man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
into nights black livery,
double dy'd in <hi>Infamy</hi> and <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror?</hi>
whereas vertuous <hi>Honesty</hi>
renders <hi>States</hi> and <hi>Perſons</hi> ſtable
like it ſelf, whoſe glorious edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
in the rougheſt and moſt
boyſterous ſtorms ſtand unſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
like their foundation: yea
and alwaies cloathes them with
the tryumphant roabs of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
who in its <hi>armour of proof</hi>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:34098:97"/>
have combated their Foes. This
was it ſet <hi>Rome</hi> aloft in ſpight of
all oppoſition, and raiſed her
on her feet, when ready to be
trampled on by her fierceſt foes.
This was it upheld her courage
in the midſt of the greateſt loſſes,
and made her enemies tremble
in the height of their victories,
as accounting her invincible
in her vertue, which would
make all force ſtoop and vaile
bonnet in the end. Thus may
we ſee <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> even reeking
with a bloody <hi>victory,</hi> diſpatch
away his Ambaſſadour, and
ſtretch out his victorious arms
to implore a peace, whileſt the
beaten <hi>Roman</hi> diſdains to treat,
and can hardly be brought to
give any terms to the <hi>Conqueror<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
rejecting his profered <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:34098:97"/>
as much as his <hi>Gold</hi> and
<hi>bribes.</hi> For his <hi>Ambaſſadour</hi>
could not faſten the leaſt gift on
any private perſon, nor obtain
any other anſwer from the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi>
than a command to leave
<hi>Italy,</hi> and that the <hi>Conſul</hi> was
comming, and in the head of
the <hi>Roman Legions</hi> ſhould deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their Terms. This made
<hi>Fabritius</hi> contemn his profered
<hi>Gold,</hi> deride his ſtratagem of
the <hi>Elephant,</hi> which was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
brought upon him to try
if they could terrifie him; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
his profer of being next the

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:34098:98"/>
O <hi>King,</hi> for ſhould thy Subjects
once come to know me, they
would chooſe rather to ſerve
me than thee; account <hi>Fabriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
more worthy of the <hi>Throne,</hi>

<hi>Cato</hi> the elder through the

Nobility, and ſet him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove

and malice: this gave him the
<hi>Suffrages</hi> from all his <hi>Competitors,</hi>
the antient and nobleſt <hi>Roman
bloud</hi> backt with all its factions
and dependancies being unable
to ſtand in competition with a
<hi>Plebeian Probitie,</hi> or the whole
<hi>Patrician</hi> Order to put ſtop to
his being choſen <hi>Cenſor,</hi> yea and
whom he pleaſed to be joined

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:34098:98"/>
deſpight of <hi>Favour</hi> and <hi>Bribery</hi>
brought him off in all his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations;
ſo that he never was
once condemned though fifty
times impeached, but in every
action had the day; yea this
gave him the confidence to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
his greateſt <hi>adverſary</hi> to
be <hi>Judge</hi> at his laſt tryal, who

potent is <hi>Honeſty,</hi> that <hi>Malice</hi> it

openly acknowledge, or

<hi>That by prudence

are to ſit at the helm in a <hi>State:</hi>
indeed this is it which in every
art makes a man his Crafts-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter;
and there is both a civill
and Military art requiſite to the
well-governing of a State:
therefore your experienced
Soldier is choſen to command,
and men moſt verſed in State
affairs held fitteſt for counſel,
and government. Suppoſe we
were to perform a far voyage,
or to enter an unknown and
dangerous harbour, would we
not chooſe him for a Pilot who
had ofteneſt ſteered it, who
was beſt acquainted with the

and we ſhall find a Common-Wealth
may properly enough
be likened to a Ship, and the
mannagement of affairs to
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:34098:106"/>
ſteerage; thus <hi>Horace Ode</hi> 14.

            </p>
            <l>—Each petty hand</l>
            <l>Can ſteer a Ship becalm'd: but
he that will</l>
            <l>Govern, and carry her to her

            <l>His tides, his currents, how to
ſhift his ſails;</l>
            <l>What ſhe will bear in foul, what
in fair weather;</l>
            <l>Where her ſprings are, her leaks
and how to ſtop them;</l>
            <l>What ſands, what ſhelves, what
rocks do threaten her,</l>
            <l>The forces, and the natures of

            <l>And Deck knocks Heaven, then
to mannage her</l>
            <l>Becomes the name, and office of
a Pilot.</l>
            <p>Thus the prudent man muſt
not onely be well acquainted
with his own ſtrengths, the
ability of the means he hath
choſen as fit to bring him to his
propoſed end, but with the
vigor and force of whatſoever
is likely to oppoſe him: He
muſt provide for open aſſaults,
and countermine againſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
practices, for ſhould he
depend onely upon his own
power, he will be at loſs upon
every oppoſition; he will bowl
ſhort of his Mark, unleſs he
allow for rubs, which may be
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:34098:107"/>
in the way. And hence it is
that the <hi>Moralists</hi> generally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
young men as incapable
of <hi>Prudence,</hi> who by the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
heat and vigor of youth are
too fiery, apt to preſume and
run headlong into action with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any deliberation; whereas
grave men, through uſe, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
are made wary and
provident; They will look
before they leap, conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they ſhall be able to carry
on ſuch or ſuch a deſign, mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre
all oppoſition, before they
imbark themſelves in it: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Homer</hi> being to preſent a
prudent Counſeller under the
perſon of <hi>Nestor,</hi> makes him 300
years of age; a man of the
greateſt experience, who had
waded through the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:34098:108"/>
of three ages.</p>
            <p>The third help is <hi>Learning;</hi>
for there being ſo great a vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
ſuch nooks, and corners
in action, that light is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
on all ſides to further us in
our ſearch, it will be need full
for us that would be prudent
to fly to <hi>Learning</hi> for aid, which
can afford us noble and copious
aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>As firſt <hi>History,</hi> which is as
it were another <hi>uſe,</hi> but of a
more vigorous capacity. Man
clog'd with matter can move
but ſlowly, and by his birth
and outward concernments is
commonly circumſcribed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
ſome narrow nook or angle
of the World, where he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd
to ſpend that ſhorttime
of life which nature allowes: ſo
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:34098:108"/>
that let him employ his utmoſt
diligence in obſervation, and
moſt ſtrictly take notes, his
knowledge can arrive but to the
half of one ages experience, and
that too but of a few Nations
actions; whereas <hi>Hiſtory</hi> layes
before us all mankind in all ages
acting in whatever as yet hath
happened, and providing for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and againſt whatever could fall
under humane conſideration,
ſo that we ſhall not meet with
any affair which may not be
paralleld, and which we may
not find mannaged by others,
even to our hands, in the large
Volume of <hi>History.</hi> This is
that which can make a <hi>young
man prudent,</hi> and exalt his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
above the oldeſt he
that ſhall ſtand on tip to upon
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:34098:109"/>
his own obſervation: this is

ſhall ſee further than a <hi>Nestor,</hi>
than the talleſt Gyant ſtanding

This is that, which not
only enriches the memory with
variety and plenty of actions
and examples, but alſo enobles
the mind with excellent and

unleſs he be <hi>vertuous,</hi> now
the readieſt way to become ſo

wherein it conſiſts, which <hi>Moral
Philoſophy</hi> teaches, together
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:34098:110"/>
with the means to attain it. To
ſum up all, <hi>prudence</hi> it ſelf, with
all its precepts, and rules, is
here handled; whether then
ſhould we go for <hi>water</hi> but to
the <hi>Fountain,</hi> where it is moſt
pleaſant, <hi>Dulcius ex ipſo fonte
bibuntur aquae,</hi> moſt abundant,
and moſt eaſie to come by?</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Speculative Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy</hi>
is a great help; this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
<hi>Sapience,</hi> a dear friend, and
ſupport to <hi>Prudence,</hi> upon whoſe
precepts <hi>Prudence</hi> builds, and
laies the foundation of its rules;
as for example, upon the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the <hi>rational ſoul,</hi> the
doctrine of the <hi>will,</hi> and of the
<hi>affections:</hi> neither can any man
be <hi>prudent,</hi> unleſs he be able to
diſcern thoſe various circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of <hi>perſons, places,</hi> and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:34098:111"/>
               <hi>times,</hi> all which are diſtinctly
handled in <hi>Speculative Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.</hi>
Thus <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> affirms <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pience</hi>
to be marvellouſly profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
for the ſolid underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of humane <hi>felicity,</hi> (which
is the end <hi>prudence</hi> propoſes)
both becauſe the operations of
the <hi>will</hi> have their dependency
upon the operations of the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,</hi>
for we will after
the ſame rate as we underſtand;
as alſo becauſe many arguments

Philoſophy</hi> which may much

as an inſight into the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

both of them create in the mind
of man as well a love and eſteem
of vertue, as a knowledge of
the nature of Caeleſtial and
earthly things, from which
ſprings magnanimity, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty

with other. To ſum up all with
that known ſaying of <hi>Divine
Plato,</hi> Then Commonwealths
ſhall become happy, when <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Philology,</hi> a ſkill
in Languages is of much impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
to a <hi>prudent man,</hi> by which
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:34098:112"/>
he is made able not onely to
converſe with, but to dive into
the actions of <hi>Foreiners;</hi> indeed
all commerce, all correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,
all leagues are behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to this, without which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, Both <hi>Geometry,</hi> and

advance Prudence; and <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>

6. <hi>Eth.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to theſe three, to wit,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:34098:112"/>
               <hi>Natural parts, Vſe, Learning,</hi>
we may adde as inſtrumental

And now I
ſhall ſum up all with a few ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
which are held by many
more prevalent in perſwaſion
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:34098:113"/>
than advice or inſtruction. And
firſt, <hi>Solon</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> Law-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
was not onely endowed
with parts, exerciſed in affairs,
improved by travail, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently
learned, as many of his
writings teſtify; yea ſo deſirous
was he of knowledge, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his death-bed being viſited
by ſome friends, he lifted up
his head, and liſtned to their
diſcourſe, and when aſked for
what end he was ſo attentive,
returned this anſwer, <hi>that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this, I may dy more learned.</hi>
Thus <hi>Epimanondas,</hi> the glory of
<hi>Thebes,</hi> is reported by <hi>Thucydi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>
to have ſtudied much, but
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, without effemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
Thus <hi>Philip,</hi> thus <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi>
thus <hi>Philopomen, Cato</hi> the
younger, <hi>Julius</hi> and <hi>Auguſtus
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:34098:113"/>
Caeſar</hi> were learned, the latter
of which diſcharged a <hi>Conſular
Legat,</hi> as rude, unlearned, and
unfit for imployment, becauſe
he had writen <hi>ixi</hi> for <hi>ipſi.</hi> Thus
<hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> the good Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
was called the <hi>Philoſopher,</hi>
and that famous Lady <hi>Iſabella</hi>
of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the incomparable

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:34098:115"/>
though this Law might now
and then be diſpenſed with in
ſome extraordinary danger, and
for ſome more than ordinary
worth and vertue in ſome ſingle
perſon, as <hi>Scipio Africanus, Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio
Aemilianus,</hi> and <hi>Pompeius Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus:</hi>
as there can be no general
rule but may admit of ſome
exception, eſpecially where the
reaſon of the Law pleads againſt
the Letter, which taken ſtrictly
would deprive the State of the
ſervice of ſuch eminent Citizens
when her dangers would admit
of no delay: yet for the general
it was inviolably obſerved until
the unruly and tyrannous
<hi>Monarchs</hi> turned this topſie
turvy, together with all other
their moſt ſacred Laws and
Liberties. Thus alſo we ſhall
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:34098:115"/>
find <hi>Lycurgus</hi> that wiſe Lawgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
among the <hi>Spartans,</hi> (who
ſo long as they obſerved his
rules were the moſt eminent
State among the <hi>Greeks</hi>) would
admit none into the Senate,
unleſs he were ſixty years of
age.</p>
            <p>But we ſhall conclude this
with ſome few examples which
may convince us throughly of
the benefit of <hi>Prudence. Cato
the elder</hi> being <hi>Conſul,</hi> had <hi>Spain</hi>
alotted for his Province, which
was then near to a total revolt;
coming thither the <hi>Celtiberians,</hi>
a warlike and populous nation,
offered to aid him for 2000
talents; this propoſition was
generally diſliked by the
<hi>Romans,</hi> as a thing unworthy
the <hi>Roman</hi> magnaminity, by
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:34098:116"/>
money to buy aid or friendſhip,
until the <hi>Conſul</hi> convinc'd them
how ſmall a thing the <hi>Celtiberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
demanded, without whoſe
aid there was no hopes of <hi>victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
For ſhould we overcome by
their aſſistance, we will pay them
out of the enemies ſpoils, ſaid he,
but ſhould we and they be beaten,
neither will they be alive to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
nor ſhall we be left to pay.
Scipio Africanus,</hi> being about
to invade <hi>Afrike,</hi> and carry the
war to the gates of <hi>Carthage,</hi>
prudently ſeeing that a <hi>State</hi>
which warred by Mercinaries,
would be weakeſt at home,
ſelected 300 able and reſolute
young men out of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Legions, whom he kept about
him, none knowing to what
end, and being arrived in <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily,</hi>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:34098:116"/>
he commanded 300 of the
nobleſt and wealthieſt <hi>Sicilian
young Gentlemen</hi> to appear ſuch
a day with their horſe and arms.
The time being come, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
whether they were
willing to go with him, or no?
for he had rather they ſhould
now tell the truth, than after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
be unprofitable, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active,
as ſuch would be. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
one of them anſwered,
that if he were put to his choice
he ſhould rather ſtay at home;
<hi>Scipio</hi> commending him for his
ingenuity, and calling one of
the 300 hundred <hi>Roman</hi> young
men, this youth, ſaith he, ſhall
ſerve in your ſtead upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
you will furniſh him with
horſe and arms, and take him
home, and exerciſe and teach
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:34098:117"/>
him; which he joyfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
to, all the reſt preſently
deſired a diſmiſſion upon the
ſame terms: Thus raiſed he a
gallant Troop, which did him
great ſervice, without charge
to the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> whose
treaſury was emptyed by
a long and chargeable war:
and obliged the <hi>Sicilians</hi>
and their friends, by
diſmiſſing their perſons from a
dangerous war upon ſo ſmall
and inconſiderable a condition
as that ſeemed to them, who
would have given far more had
they been put to their own
choice. And indeed it is not
ſo much the tax, as the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of laying and levying it,
that begets diſtaſtes, tumults,
inſurrections, and revolts.
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:34098:117"/>
Had <hi>Scipio</hi> laid this charge of
providing horſe and arms, &amp;c.
upon theſe <hi>Sicilian</hi> Gentlemen,
without any other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
what mutterings would
there have been? why ſhould
we above all others be thus u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed?
and what hatred would it
have procured him? whereas
doing as he did, firſt he ſeem'd
to have a great confidence in
their worth and valour, to
chooſe them out of the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
of <hi>Sicily;</hi> then a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of and civility to their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
by enquiring whether
they were willing to ſerve or
no; Laſtly a greater reſpect to
their contentment than his
own, by ſo gentle and eaſie a
diſmiſſion of them whom he
had honoured above others, and
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:34098:118"/>
who by refuſing to engage with
him, diſappointed his hopes, &amp;
made void the great expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
he had of them: and ſo by
this means impoſed an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon them, who in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way would have looked on
it as a great diſcourteſie. And
as we find the benefit of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in theſe, ſo may we ſee
the miſchiefs which impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
raſhneſs wrought in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
examples. As in <hi>Coriola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
who by his ſtubborn and
harſh carriage brought baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on himſelf, a miſerable
war and diſgrace upon his
Countrey, which at laſt cauſed
his death. Thus <hi>Terentius Varro</hi>
by raſhneſs and imprudency
had almoſt ruined his Country
in that fatal and bloody battail
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:34098:118"/>
at <hi>Cannae.</hi> And multitudes of
other examples we ſhall meet
with in all Hiſtories, yea and in
our own dayly experience and

            <p>Nowfor to handle this at large,
I ſuppoſe would be to little
purpoſe, there being none that
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:34098:120"/>
perceive not that it is the chief
duty, as being of general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment,
of the Magiſtrate to
look well to the exerciſe of this
vertue: I ſhall onely therefore
hint in ſome caſes which are
eſſentiall to the welbeing of a
State.</p>
            <p>As firſt in caſes of publick
danger, the particular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of a State are bound <hi>in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
to help the publick with their
private stocks,</hi> thus we ſhall
find in the <hi>Roman</hi> State<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Liv. dec.</hi>
3. <hi>l.</hi> 6. They brought in all
their Gold, Silver, and coined
Braſs, reſerving only enough

and for the publick ſervice of

motive, <hi>Reſpublicaincolumis &amp;
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:34098:121"/>
privatas res facile ſalvas praestet:
publica prodendo tua nequicquam
ſerves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi>
after the danger is paſt, is in
Juſtice bound <hi>to ſee theſe publick
debts ſati<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fyed,</hi> there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more to be preſerved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable
than the publick faith:
Beſides Prudence teaches this,
for if the people perceive them
negligent in their publick truſt,
it will make them refractory,
and careleſs in their private du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
We ſhall inſtance no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than in trading, a man once
breaking his word, will never
be truſted upon his bond, and
it would be a ſad plunge to put
a State to get another State to
be bound for them, and an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilty
to find any private
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:34098:121"/>
ſecurity for ſuch large ſums.</p>
            <p>The third thing required by
Juſtice is, <hi>That the Magistrate
ought not in the leaſt to incroach
upon the right of particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
further than the common
neceſſity or good requires:</hi> thus in
the beforementioned place we
ſhall find, that firſt the <hi>Conſuls,</hi>
then the <hi>Senate,</hi> then the <hi>Roman
Knights</hi> brought in their Gold,
&amp;c. They were examples to
the people, not exactors upon
them. And to ſay the truth,
the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> is intruſted for
the publick good, and it is not
in his power to do a private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,
they are <hi>Gods Subſtitutes,</hi>
whoſe glorious attribute it is,
That he cannot do injuſtice and
the <hi>Peoples Trustees,</hi> to rule for
their good: now grant that
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:34098:122"/>
they may extrajudicially take
away one mans right, and it
will follow that they may take
away any mans, and all mens.</p>
            <p>The fourth thing is, <hi>Invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lably
to obſerve all Leagues, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and Publick promiſes with
Foreiners:</hi> This will make them
be believ'd, lov'd, and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
abroad. Thus we ſhall ſee
that the <hi>Romans</hi> in defence of,
and revenge for their Allyes of
<hi>Saguntum,</hi> undertook that long,
bloody, and almoſt fatal ſecond
Punick war; nay and when
<hi>Hannibal</hi> was in the heart of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly,</hi>
yet ſent they Armies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Spain,</hi> and upon the firſt
opportunity reſtored that City,
gathered the ſcattered Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
bought thoſe that were
ſlaves, and took a ſharp revenge
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:34098:122"/>
upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their borderers, even to the
final ruin of the Nation which
had been inſtrumental in their
miſeries. Thus ſhall we ſee them
reſtore the Kingdom of <hi>Egypt</hi> to
<hi>Ptolomy</hi> their Ally, when driven

            <p>The fifth thing is, <hi>To have a
ſacred reſpect to the Perſons of

and when they for reſpect to

them) denyed to deliver him

               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:34098:123"/>
               <hi>The ſixth thing is,</hi> To en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour

and if theſe will not

Conſul deinde M. Acilius ex S. c. ad
collegium Faecialium retulit, ipſine
utique regi Antiocho indiceretur

Aetolis quoque ſeparatim indici
juberunt bellum? et num prius

Faeciales reſponderunt,
jam ante ſeſe, cum de Philippo
Conſulerentur, decreviſſe nihil
referre ipſi coram an ad praeſidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
nunciaretur, amicitiam re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciatam
videri, cum legatis to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:34098:124"/>
repetentibus res, nec reddi, nec

ultro ſibi bellum indixiſſe,
cum Demetriadem ſociorum urbem
per vim occupaſſent, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The ſeventh is, <hi>Honourably
to reward their own Citizens who
deſerve well.</hi> And there can be
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o greater ſpur to vertue, nor
a better way to propagate and
increaſe it. Thus we ſhall ſee
what Tryumphs, what Ovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
what Crowns were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
on victorious Generalls,
and valiant Souldiers; as he
that preſerved the life of a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen
had an Oaken Crown, and
he that firſt gain'd the top of
the wall, a Mural one, by the
<hi>Roman</hi> State.</p>
            <p>The eight is, <hi>Duly and juſtly
to pay thoſe that ſerve them.</hi> And
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:34098:124"/>
this will render them well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
and well followed; and
though they make uſe onely of
their own Citizens, yet ought
theſe to be well paid who gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly
venture their lives; ſhall
they be liberal of their blood,
and ſhall others be niggardly of
their purſes? beſides, they leave
their callings, and all other
means of providing mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
Thus was their a conſtant
proviſion of lands among the
<hi>Romans</hi> for thoſe that had ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
their time of warfare, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhall we ever find a mutiny
for want of pay; and our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
tells us, No man goeth to
a warfare on his own charge.</p>
            <p>The ninth is, <hi>To have a tender
regard of their Widdowes and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans,
who have nobly loſt their
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:34098:125"/>
lives in their Countrey's defence.</hi>
Shall we enjoy reſt, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
&amp; ſee theirs periſhing for
want by whoſe valour we have
been preſerved? beſides, it is a
great diſcouragement to others
to venture their lives for us,
when they ſhall ſee ſuch a cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
in their deaths ready to
ceaſe the deareſt pledges of their
ſouls. Thus the <hi>Romans</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
them portions out of the
publick Stock.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The tenth is,</hi> To have the
like regard of ſuch men and their
families, who have liberally layd
out their own estates in the publick
ſervice, or have been ſo publickly
minded, as that they have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
their private benefit. <hi>Thus
did the</hi> Romans <hi>often bury
great and noble Captains, who
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:34098:125"/>
di'd poor, on the public charge,
and beſtow their Daughters
according to their qualities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The eleventh is, <hi>To Crown
the Memories of thoſe who had
done publick ſervice, with Statues,
and tryumphant Arches,</hi> which
was every where to be ſeen in
that noble and grateful City of
<hi>Rome.</hi> And as theſe are juſt,
neceſſary, of good concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the nouriſhing of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſpirits, and producing brave
actions, ſo on the other ſide it
will be the ſame.</p>
            <p>Twelfly, <hi>Severely to puniſh all
incendaries, ſeditious, trayte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and cowardly perſons,</hi> and
that firſt to amend ſuch, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
to keep the publick au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
from contempt, third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to terrifie others by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:34098:126"/>
Thus <hi>Seneca, Ni mia
enim licentia adverſus malos, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitas
eſt adverſus bonos.</hi> And
<hi>Cicero, Quare ita probanda est
manſuetudo, ut adhibeatur Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicae
cauſa ſeveritas, ſine qua
administrari civitas non poteſt.</hi>
And indeed <hi>obſta principiis,</hi> to
nip ſuch practices in the bud, is
the ſafeſt way, which by
connivency may grow to ſuch
an height as it will be hard to
reſiſt: a ſmall ſpark unregarded
may kindle a flame that ſhall
burn a City: and the <hi>Romans</hi>
were ſo careful in this, that the
greateſt ſervices, and nobleſt
extraction could not turn the
Scale of Juſtice, as in <hi>Manlius
Capitolinus, Saturninus, Tiberius</hi>
and <hi>Caius Gracchus, Catiline,
Lentulus, Cethegus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:34098:126"/>
Laſtly, <hi>To take an exact
account of thoſe that ſhall embeazle
or purloin the Publick treaſure;
tyrannize and oppreſſe the people
under their charge.</hi> For
connivency in ſuch caſes will
be of very bad conſequence,
both in keeping the publick
poor and behind-hand, in
making Officers Knaves, and
wicked, and in undoing,
diſheartning and enraging the
people: therefore we ſhall find
the <hi>Romans</hi> very ſtrict in this
point, often calling to account
and condemning, even ſome
very eminent for other deſerts,
as in <hi>Scipio Aſiaticus, Marcellus,</hi>
and thoſe noble Orations of
<hi>Tully</hi> againſt <hi>Verres.</hi> And indeed
this is the onely means to
preſerve peace and plenty; for
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:34098:127"/>
a poor people will be alwaies
buſling, and an oppreſſed
careleſs to gather, or play the
good huſbands, not knowing
how long they ſhall enjoy their
own. Therefore <hi>Boaetius</hi>
excellently ſaies, <hi>Annuum bonum,
non tam de magnis fructibus,
quam de juſte regnantibus
existimandum,</hi> the one will
quickly be devoured without
the other.</p>

ceaſing upon their prey
where they met with any weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

general aſſertion is taken for
granted on all hands, we ſhall
only therefore endeavor to give
our thoughts in ſome paticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:34098:128"/>
which ſeem to concern
the <hi>Laws of England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As firſt that our <hi>Generous and
knowing Anceſtors</hi> plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
that there could be no
<hi>Liberty</hi> where there was no <hi>Law,</hi>
were very careful to bring all
things to a <hi>certainty,</hi> ſo that the
very <hi>Judges</hi> are obliged to take
notice of it as well as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and are bound up to obſerve
the <hi>Law</hi> as much as <hi>Plantiff</hi> or
<hi>Defendant:</hi> and this, becauſe to
ſet up <hi>Arbitrary Courts</hi> or <hi>Judges</hi>
were to leave the people to
their will, and in a miſt to grope
after ſurmizes what ſuch or
ſuch perſons would determine;
and indeed until men were om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcient,
or could prophetically
foretel the imaginations of the
Rulers or Judges hearts, it were
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:34098:128"/>
the higheſt piece of injuſtice to
call men to account for a thing
committed againſt no law, and
a thing not to be named to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
them. What could a
man call his own, unleſs there
were <hi>tenures warranted</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by <hi>Law?</hi> and to bring a
criminal proceſs for a thing no
where declared a <hi>crime,</hi> would
be a <hi>Tyranny</hi> our Monarchs in
the worſt ages would have
bluſht at.</p>
            <p>But it may be ſaid, <hi>What need
there ſo many? theſe engender
but ſtrife and vexation;</hi> truly
for ſtrife its the effect of peoples
perverſeneſs, not the <hi>law:</hi> and
ſhould thoſe actions of <hi>Battery,</hi>
actions <hi>upon the caſe for words,</hi>
and actions <hi>of treſpaſs</hi> be taken
away, we ſhould quickly ſee
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:34098:129"/>
the people make themſelves
<hi>Judges,</hi> and by revenging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
fall together by the ears:
our wiſe <hi>Anceſtors</hi> being aware
of ſuch a miſchief thought it
better to let them vent their
petty <hi>animoſities</hi> in a <hi>ſute</hi> where
ſome ſmall matter of money
might be thrown away, and
ſpend their ſpleen in opening
each others purſe, than to fall
into deadly <hi>fewds,</hi> wherein
kinred on both fides would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage,
and ſo print their reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
in <hi>murder</hi> and <hi>ruin,</hi> as we
have heard practiſed in the
Northern parts of this Iſland,
and our forefathers ſaw, and
provided againſt. For let us
aſſure our ſelves, to provide no
remedy by <hi>law</hi> againſt theſe
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:34098:129"/>
               <hi>injuries,</hi> which are the main be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
of all quarrels, would
not only make mem more ready
to provoke, but others as apt
to revenge themſelves being
provoked, and of what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
this will be to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering
the civil peace,
good, and quiet of a Nation,
I leave to the world to judge.</p>
            <p>To conclude, as the <hi>Law
of England</hi> gives rules, and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
men their <hi>duties,</hi> ſo is it the
moſt careful and provident for
their tryals; it ſo abhors arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarineſs
(as the enemy of
liberty, and father of injuſtice)
that it will not truſt the matter
of Fact, and of Law in one hand,
but ſets <hi>twelve men of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood</hi>
to give their verdict
for fact; againſt whom it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:34098:130"/>
an attaint, and being
found guilty inflicts on them a
dreadful puniſhment; ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
is it of the lives and liberties
of particular perſons, and ſo
provident that <hi>Juſtice</hi> ſhould be
impartially adminiſtred; And
now if any by his living in
<hi>Turky</hi> is become enamoured of
ſlavery, let him chooſe arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Courts, for my part I
deſire a rule to teach me what
may be an offence, and <hi>Iudges</hi>
who are bound by oath to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
that rule to give ſentence,
and twelve of the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
to enquire of the fact, and
againſt whom their lies an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taint,
and upon eviction a
dreadful puniſhment, before
an arbitrary Court, though
never ſo carefully picked, and
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:34098:130"/>
ſo I am ſure do all underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Engliſh</hi> men, who any whit
prize and value their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>Another objection there is
againſt the <hi>Iudges, That they are
for life;</hi> and that ſuch a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
may make them remiſs
and ſloathful, and that by a
continual uſe they become leſs
reverent of Juſtice, as a work
which dayly uſe makes tedious
and clogging: not omitting
that it may create faction and
combination, as <hi>Livy</hi> notes of
the <hi>Carthaginians, qui unum e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus
ordinis, idem adverſos omnes
habebat;</hi> as laſtly that it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
corruption by taking away
fear of calling to account: and
therefore the <hi>Romans Decurias
Iudicum ſcribebant, ex honestiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimis,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:34098:131"/>
&amp; ex cenſu (ne paupertas
ad culpam impelleret): ſed non
eas omnes aſſidue judicare vole
bant, duntaxat quotannis certum
&amp; neceſſarium numerum ſorte lege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant,
reliquis tunc feriatis.</hi> All
this we allow in arbitrary Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
who cannot be too ſhort a
time limitted; but where there
are lawes according to which
they are to judge, there they
ought to have experience and
knowledge, which muſt of
neceſſity encreaſe by practice
and continuance. Thus the
<hi>Romans</hi> whileſt they were poor
and in continual war, there
was no great cauſe of ſtrife,
wealth being wanting, and the
war employing them and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them buſie, ſo that they
had little leiſure for private
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:34098:131"/>
brawls: but when they began
to enjoy peace and plenty, they
had their <hi>Decemviri,</hi> which
were of continuance, and ſtill
provided by new Lawes to bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
new enormities. So that
take away law and continuance
will be as dangerous, as the
loſs of <hi>liberty</hi> and <hi>right</hi> will be
inevitable; for we muſt hold all
at will, and have no rule to
call Judges to account by, whoſe
will muſt be our final determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and as they think ſo

a cowardice that makes

they are injurious to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealth, which they deprive
of a member; yet here for a Sea

<pb n="253" facs="tcp:34098:133"/>
for the aiming at his

            <p>For the <hi>Roman</hi> practice of this

the leaſt foot-ſtep of cowardice
in that gallant and victorious

in this glorious production: for

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
all things ought to be choſen
or dore. Now Temperance mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derating
theſe paſſions keeps
the mind undiſturbed, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:34098:136"/>
is ſtiled, The Conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatrix
of Prudence.</p>
            <p>We ſhall define it, A vertue
preſerving a juſt decorum in the
deſiring and enjoying ſenſual
delights: for grief, which comes
within its verge, that only ariſes
from want of fruition. It is
therefore the duty of a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat
man to abhor diſhoneſt, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately
to deſire, and enjoy
lawful pleaſures, and not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately
to grieve when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of them. Now lawful-pleaſures
are ſuch as firſt <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
exceed not our
eſtates, and miſbecom the rank
and quality we live in.</p>
            <p>And of what avail this <hi>vertue</hi>
is to the preſervation and
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:34098:136"/>
growth of a State, Hiſtory and
obſervation every where, and
every day, may clearly make
out unto us. This was it ſet
<hi>Rome</hi> upon her legs; This is it
that made her Citizens able of
body, both to fight, and endure
the field; This made her Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
contemn bribes; and her
Generals in the height of, mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
heat, and ſucceſs, ſlight
pleaſure, and conſtantly keep
the <hi>publick good,</hi> and their <hi>own
honour</hi> in their eye. Thus ſhall
we ſee the noble <hi>Curius,</hi> when
the conquered <hi>Samnites</hi> profe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him <hi>Gold,</hi> ſhew them his
<hi>Dinner</hi> (for he was at their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
cooking it himſelf) which
was a few rape roots in a <hi>pipkin,</hi>
telling them there was no great
need of <hi>gold</hi> to furniſh his <hi>table,</hi>
               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:34098:137"/>
and that he had rather com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
over ſuch as had Gold,
than poſſeſs it himſelf. And
when ſome complained that he
had aſſigned too little of the
conquered Lands to private
men, and too much to the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi>
He told them, He hoped
that there was never a <hi>Roman</hi>
Citizen which would count
that land too little which was
ſufficient to maintain him. Thus
ſhall we ſee <hi>Scipio Africanus,</hi>
when the Souldiers brought
him a moſt beautiful Damoſel,
taken in the ſack of <hi>New Carthage</hi>
in <hi>Spain,</hi> and hearing ſhe was
betroathed to <hi>Allucius</hi> a young
Prince of the <hi>Celtiberians,</hi> he
ſent for him, and not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
on him his beautiful
Bride, but a great ſum of Gold
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:34098:137"/>
as her portion, which her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
brought for her ranſome.
Let us behold the event, this
young Prince goes home rapt
with joy, filling every place
with the praiſe and merit of
<hi>Scipio,</hi> telling his Countrymen,
<hi>Veniſſe Diis ſimillimum juvenem,
vincentem omnia cum armis, tum
benignitate, ac beneficiis,</hi> There
was a Godlike young man ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived,
conquering all both by
force and bounty: and within
a few daies returned with 1400
horſe to <hi>Scipio</hi>'s Camp. Thus by
his temperance he advanced the
<hi>Roman</hi> cauſe, which he prefer'd
above all private pleaſure, and
gave <hi>Carthage</hi> a greater blow in
this <hi>victory</hi> over himſelf, than in
that other of taking their City,

we have not of late known

as if we had been the adopted
