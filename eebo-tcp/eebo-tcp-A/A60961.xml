            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
EPILOGUE.</head>
            <l>A Virgin Poet was serv'd up to day;</l>
            <l>Who till this hour, ne're cackled for a Play:</l>
            <l>He's neither yet a Whigg nor Tory-Boy;</l>
            <l>But, like a Girl, whom several wou'd enjoy,</l>
            <l>Begs leave to make the best of his own natural Toy.</l>
            <l>Were I to play my callow Author's game,</l>
            <l>The King's House wou'd instruct me, by the Name:</l>
            <l>There's Loyalty to one: I wish no more:</l>
            <l>A Commonwealth sounds like a common Whore.</l>
            <l>Let Husband or Gallant be what they will,</l>
            <l>One part of Woman is true Tory still.</l>
            <l>If any factious spirit should rebell,</l>
            <l>Our Sex, with ease, can every, rising quell.</l>
            <l>Then, as you hope we shou'd your failings hide,</l>
            <l>An honest Iury for our play provide:</l>
            <l>Whiggs at their Poets never take offence;</l>
            <l>They save dull Culpritts who have Murther'd Sense:</l>
            <l>Tho Nonsense is a nauseous heavy Mass,</l>
            <l>The Vehicle call'd faction makes it pass.</l>
            <l>Faction in Play's the Commonwealths man's bribe:</l>
            <l>The leaden farthing of the Canting Tribe:</l>
            <l>Though void in payment Laws and Statutes make it,</l>
            <l>The Neighbourhood, that knows the Man, will take it.</l>
            <l>'Tis Faction buys the Votes of half the Pit;</l>
            <l>Their's is the Pension-Parliament of wit.</l>
            <l>In City-Clubs their venom let 'em vent;</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:50840:35"/>
For there 'tis safe, in its own Element:</l>
            <l>Here, where their madness can have no pretence,</l>
            <l>Let 'em forget themselves an hour in sense.</l>
            <l>In one poor Isle, why shou'd two Factions be?</l>
            <l>Small diff'rence in your Vices I can see;</l>
            <l>In Drink and Drabs both sides too well agree.</l>
            <l>Wou'd there were more Preferments in the Land;</l>
            <l>If Places fell, the party cou'd not stand.</l>
            <l>Of this damn'd grievance ev'ry Whigg complains;</l>
            <l>They grunt like Hogs, till they have got their Grains.</l>
            <l>Mean time you see what Trade our Plots advance,</l>
            <l>We send each year good Money into <hi>France:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And they, that know what Merchandise we need,</l>
            <l>Send o're true Protestants, to mend our breed.</l>
