            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of the Introduction of Commerce and Money.</head>
               <p n="1">1. 'TIS not to be Doubted, but that the firſt
Ages were altogether unacquainted with
Trade and Commerce.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For being content with the ſimple
Productions of Nature, every one Furniſhed themſelves
therewith by the Labour and Induſtry of their own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Families.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But when the World became more Populous, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Perſons addicted themſelves to more peculiar Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagements,
either from the Propenſity of their Genius,
or the Conveniency and Aptitude of thoſe Habitations
that fell to their Lot; ſome Employing themſelves chiefly
in the Breeding of Cattel, others of Corn, ſome acquired
Skill in Architecture or Building of Houſes, others Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
themſelves to the Making of Utenſils and other
needful Conveniencies.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And thus People found a greater Convenience in
making uſe of each others Aſſiſtance, and that they were
better Suppli'd thereby, than when they were forc'd to
divert themſelves from their own more peculiar Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106790:3"/>
to Attempt thoſe things for which they were not ſo
well qualified.</p>
               <p n="5">5. By this Means then was Commerce begun.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Yet in the Beginning 'twas Manag'd no otherwiſe
than by Exchanging Commodities for Commodities.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But this Method became very difficult, when Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
could not readily find mutual Demands for thoſe
things they had to Exchange.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Some things, either by Reaſon of their being more
Rare of Production, or Requiring more Art or Labour to
acquire them, came to obtain a greater Value or Eſteem
among Men.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Of theſe 'tis probable that Metals gain'd the firſt
Eſtimation, becauſe of their Hardneſs, and the many U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
they were Applicable to: And among thoſe, Gold and
Silver came to be moſt Valued, as much Excelling the
others in the Perfection of their natural Fineneſs and
Duration, and being more Rare to be found.</p>
               <p n="10">10. A ſmall Bulk or Weight of theſe Fineſt Metals,
being Eſteemed of great Value, they were therefore made
Choice of as the fitteſt Medium for the Exchange or Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing
of all other Commodities.</p>
               <p n="11">11. But as theſe were ſubject to be Adulterated by the
Mixture of Baſer Metals, certain Standards were Agreed
upon to Adjuſt the Fineneſs; and the Value thereof was
Computed by Weight.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Yet that the ſame might become Currant, and the
trouble of proving every Piece be avoided, 'twas found
needful, that every Prince or State ſhould affix a Mark or
Stamp on ſuch Pieces as were Currant in that Countrey;
thereby giving Publick Credit to the Truth thereof: And
this obtained the Name of Money or Coin.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Progreſs and Various Methods of Trade.</head>
               <p n="13">13. MOney then becoming the Means whereby all
things neceſſary for Human Life might be Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed,</p>
               <p n="14">14. People exerted their utmoſt Induſtry for Procuring
the ſame, eſteeming it their chiefeſt Treaſure.</p>
               <p n="15">15. But the Almighty Creator had ſo diſpoſed the
World, that as particular Perſons, ſo alſo did different Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
ſtand in need of the various Productions of each other.</p>
               <p n="16">16. And this made way for Trade and Merchandize, by
the Carrying and Vending the Commodities of one Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
into another; which alſo occaſioned the more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Uſe of Money.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Yet did Trade admit of very different Kinds of
Management, according to the different Occaſions of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Countries.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Sometimes the Merchant carried his Goods to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Countrey, and brought home the whole Produce in
other Commodities of that Countrey which were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in his own; ſometimes he brought part Goods and
part Money; and to ſome Places he was forc'd to carry
the greateſt Value in Money for the Purchaſing ſuch Goods
as were wanted in his own Countrey.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Either of theſe Trades might be equally profitable
to the Merchant; but that Trade brings moſt Profit to his
Countrey, when he returns with moſt Money.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Yet it may not be diſadvantagious to a Nation, to
ſend out its Money for the Purchaſing ſome Profitable
Commodities; if ſo be the Money they draw in by their
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106790:4"/>
Trade with other Countries, doth in the whole ſurmount
the Value they ſhall ſo ſend out.</p>
               <p n="21">21. For by this means their People, Beaſts of Burden,
and Ships (where they have them) come to be employ'd,
and the greater Circulation of Riches is made among them.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Nay even Superfluities may be admitted, where they
have no worſe a Conſequence upon the Publick, than the
drawing Money from thoſe that moſt abound in Wealth,
and cauſing it to Circulate among the Needier ſort who
depend upon Trade.</p>
               <p n="23">23. Likewiſe when a Trading Nation doth by ſuch
Means procure Commodities, to Export them to other
People, who are leſs Induſtrious in ſerving themſelves; ſuch
a Trade is to their Advantage, for as much as it returns at
laſt with a Surplus of Money.</p>
               <p n="24">24. From hence 'tis Evident, that the Profit of a Trading
People, is not to be Computed from their Negotiations with
any particular Countrey, whether it be by Money or Goods,
but from the Ballance of their Trade in General.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. III.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of the different Computations of Money in diſtinct
Governments.</head>
               <p n="25">25. AS we have already Noted, that Money is become
the Medium of all Commerce, we are yet to
Conſider that different Nations have very different Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations
of the Value even of this Medium.</p>
               <p n="26">26. For diſtinct Governments made the Allay of their
Metals Finer or Courſer, and gave their Coins ſuch Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations,
and as many different Species, as they thought
neceſſary to themſelves, without regard to the different
Uſage of their Neighbours.</p>
               <p n="27">
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:106790:4"/>
27. Therefore People do not currantly Receive or
Eſteem Foreign Coins according to the Value or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
that Foreigners put upon them; but according
to the Weight that the Silver and Gold will yield, redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to the Standard of their own Countrey.</p>
               <p n="28">28. Moreover, Silver and Gold themſelves (which
we may call by the general name of <hi>Bullion</hi>) are to be
conſidered but as a Finer ſort of Commodities; and as
ſuch, are capable of Riſing and Falling in Price, and may
be ſaid to be of more or leſs Value in divers places, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their Plenty or Scarcity.</p>
               <p n="29">29. Bullion then may there be reckon'd to be of the
Higher Value, where the Smaller Weight will purchaſe the
Greater Quantity of the Product or Manufacture of the
Countrey.</p>
               <p n="30">30. And according to this Rule, the Riches or Poverty of
a Countrey is to be Computed; even as the Riches of a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Man is to be reckon'd from the Weight of Bullion he
can command.</p>
               <p n="31">31. 'Tis therefore an Infallible Demonſtration of the
decay of Wealth in any Countrey, where they are reduced
to a neceſſity of abating the Standard of their Coins, or
cauſing it to paſs above its wonted Value; becauſe he that
parts with his Commodities, becomes then Poſſeſſor of a
leſs Weight of Bullion in lieu thereof.</p>
               <p n="32">32. Alſo when the Merchant Trades to ſuch Countries
from whence he muſt make his Returns in Bullion, he doth
not only regard the Weight thereof, but hath alſo conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to the Hazard, Time, and Charge of Tranſporting
it into his own Countrey.</p>
               <p n="33">33. And this Charge is ſometimes more, ſometimes
leſs, and according to the more or leſs difficulty of Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation
or Carriage, occaſioned by War or any other
Contingencies.</p>
               <p n="34">
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:106790:5"/>
34. Wherefore there can be no conſtant Standard or
Adjuſtment made, to Reduce the Computations of Foreign
Coins to the exact Value of thoſe of our own Countrey.</p>
               <p n="35">35. Yet ſuch Alterations upon theſe moſt Staple and
Precious Commodities can never be great, unleſs by ſome
extraordinary Accidents, which rarely happen.</p>
               <p n="36">36. So that a very near Regulation is always made by the
Exchanges: Of which we come next to Treat.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of the Introduction and Nature of Exchanges.</head>
               <p n="37">37. IN taking Notice of the many different Managements
of Trade, we have before ſhewn, That Trading
People do from ſome places Import Bullion in Return of
their Merchandiſe ſent out, and yet muſt ſend Bullion to
other places, for the purchaſing of ſuch Goods as they have
need to Import from thence.</p>
               <p n="38">38. Thoſe Countries alſo that take Bullion from ſome
places, becauſe they have no Occaſion for the Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that they produce, muſt yet ſend Bullion to other
places, to procure what themſelves need, and have not
other Commodities to purchaſe.</p>
               <p n="39">39. Some Merchants alſo that Trade to the ſame places,
apply themſelves only to the Importing of Commodities
purchas'd with their Money; whereas others, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
Trade only by ſending of their Goods to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
and making their Returns by Money.</p>
               <p n="40">40. To avoid then the Charge, Trouble and Hazard in
Carrying Money in <hi>Specie</hi> to and again for the Supplying
all theſe differing Occaſions, the Method of Drawing and
Remitting Money by Bills of Exchange was found out.</p>
               <p n="41">
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:106790:5"/>
41. For hereby People were mutually ſerv'd, the one
delivering his Money to the Perſon who wanted it at home,
to receive the Value where his Occaſions required it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.</p>
               <p n="42">42. But in this alſo it was difficult for particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
to find out each others Conveniencies.</p>
               <p n="43">43. Therefore ſome Merchants applied themſelves to

their Trade to furniſh all People according to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
               <p n="44">44. But whenſoever the Demands for Bills to any place
is greater, than that theſe Exchangers can find other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittances
to imburſe their Correſpondents, they are then
neceſſitated to tranſport ſo much in Bullion as will make
the Ballance.</p>
               <p n="45">45. And here again it may be Noted, That in this Caſe
they are not to have regard to the Computations of their
own Money, but to the Value that the Foreign Nation
puts upon the Weight.</p>
               <p n="46">46. The Exchanger alſo takes ſuch a Conſideration from
the Remitter, as may not only pay his Charge and Hazard,
but alſo redound to his Profit.</p>
               <p n="47">47. Yet this <hi>Praemio,</hi> or Advance on the Exchanges can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be great, unleſs (as is aforeſaid) upon ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary

               <p n="48">48. Becauſe People would then rather chuſe to ſend
their own Bullion to anſwer their particular Occaſions.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Riſing and Falling of Exchanges and Bullion.</head>
               <p n="49">49. AS we have before ſaid, That Bullion is capable of
a ſmall Riſing and Falling in Price.</p>
               <p n="50">50. Exchanges are alſo reciprocaly ſubject to the ſame
Alteration; the one being commonly influenced by the
other.</p>
               <p n="51">51. And in the Commerce of moſt Countries there are
Times and Seaſons when the Exchanges are ſubject to riſe
and fall.</p>
               <p n="52">52. At ſuch times when Ships uſually come to carry off
the Product of any Countrey, the Exchanges are wont to
Riſe; but when that Demand ceaſes, the Exchanges gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
Fall.</p>
               <p n="53">53. Theſe are the Occaſions by which Bullion and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes
do ordinarily come to Riſe and Fall; but theſe
Alterations, as before Noted, cannot be great.</p>
               <p n="54">54. Yet there are ſome extraordinary Emergencies
whereby the Exchanges, and conſequently Bullion, may
come to Advance much more conſiderably.</p>
               <p n="55">55. As when any Nation ſhall become ſo profuſe as to
Expend more of the Product of other Commodities, than
the Value of the Commodities they ſend abroad.</p>
               <p n="56">56. Or if being engaged in a Foreign War, they ſhall
be obliged to maintain an Army out of their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
the Charge whereof ſhall come to exceed the whole
Ballance of their Trade.</p>
               <p n="57">57. In either of theſe Caſes 'tis evident, That what the
Value which that Nation ſends to Foreign Countries ſhall
fall ſhort of the Expence, muſt unavoidably be ſent out
in Bullion.</p>
               <p n="58">
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:106790:6"/>
58. And as this will firſt cauſe the Exchanges to Riſe
extravagantly, ſo the neceſſity of purchaſing Bullion to
Export for the ſatisfying the Over Ballance of their Trade,
will of Conſequence cauſe an Advance upon the Price of
Bullion.</p>
               <p n="59">59. Neither can ſuch a Nations Raiſing the Computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Coins, or Abaſing of their Allay, prevent the
ſending out One Peny the leſs; becauſe there is no other
Medium of paying the Over Ballance: And therefore the
Exchange will infallibly Riſe proportionable to the ſame
Alteration they ſhall make in their Coins; becauſe (as is
before Obſerved) Foreigners will only reſpect the Weight
of the Bullion we bring them, without having any regard
to the Computations we put upon it.</p>
               <p n="60">60. Such a Nation then muſt infallibly grow poor, if
this Expence continue long; even as a Private Man will
be Impoveriſhed, when he ſpends more than his Income;
though a Rich Man, or Nation, may hold it out longer
than a Poorer.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Abuſes of Money, and the Remedies.</head>
               <p n="61">61. THere is ſcarce any Nation that hath been free from
the Practices of Ill Men to Corrupt and Abuſe
the Currant Coins.</p>
               <p n="62">62. And this is done either by Counterfeiting the ſame
in baſer Metals, or by Clipping or Diminiſhing the true
Moneys.</p>
               <p n="63">63. Either of theſe are made Capital Crimes in all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments.</p>
               <p n="64">64. To prevent the Counterfeiting, the Government
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106790:7"/>
uſually Employ the moſt curious Artiſts to make ſuch
Stamps as may not eaſily be imitated.</p>
               <p n="65">65. So that for the moſt part, this Abuſe is diſcovered by
thoſe that are skilful in the Knowledge of Money.</p>
               <p n="66">66. Yet there are ſome Counterfeits ſo neatly done, that
even the moſt skilful are ſometimes deceived by them.</p>
               <p n="67">67. To obviate which there is no means ſo certain as to try
the Money by Weight; for there is ſuch a difference between
the Weight of Metals as may Diſcriminate the Fraud.</p>
               <p n="68">68. If any ſhall Attempt to make their Counterfeit Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the due Weight, they will ſo much differ in Breadth
or Thickneſs, as may make it diſcernable by the Eye: And
People that want that Judgment, may as well keep a Pair
of ſmall Calliper Compaſſes as a Pair of Scales, a Trial by
both which would infallibly diſcover all Frauds. And then
the Falſe Pieces might be ordered to be immediately bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and the Offerer queſtioned how he came by them.</p>
               <p n="69">69. And this Method would not only deſtroy all the Bad
Money as faſt as it ſhould be Diſcovered; but alſo ſo ſoon
hinder the Vent of it in Quantity, that it muſt utterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
the Undertakers from Proceeding in a Buſineſs of
that Hazard, when they could make but ſmall Earnings of it.</p>
               <p n="70">70. The Clipping of the Coins can never be introduced,
but through the Neglect of the Government.</p>
               <p n="71">71. Yet this Miſchief hath proceeded ſo far in ſome
Countries, as to ſpoil a great Part of the Currant Coin.</p>
               <p n="72">72. And though ſeveral Methods may be Attempted to
prevent it, yet none can ever prove Effectual, but the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
it all in, and Cauſing it to be New Coin'd, and the
Loſs made up to the Proprietors at the Publick Charge,
Prohibiting the Paſſing of any ſuch for the future.</p>

            <head>A LETTER to a Miniſter of State, further
Explaining the foregoing Aphoriſms, and Applying
them to the preſent Circumſtances of this Nation.</head>
            <opener>May it pleaſe your Honour,</opener>
            <p>OBſerving the Remedies that have been Propoſed
for the Preventing the Carrying out the
Bullion of this Kingdom, and Reforming that intoler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Abuſe of Clipping our Money, to be different from
my Apprehenſions thereof; and the Difficulty there is
to convince People by Diſcourſe, That the Abaſing of
our Coin, or Raiſing the Value of our Currant Money,
would prove no effectual Means for the Remedying of
the former, made me think of Digeſting my Sentiments
thereof into Writing; thereby to give ſuch Men who
look no further than the out Side, and ſearch not into
the Bottom of things, a clearer Underſtanding of what
Money is in its own Nature, and how it is ſubject to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in its Value, by the Various Influencies of Trade and
Exchanges: But then I found it would be abſolutely
Neceſſary to give the General Notions of all theſe, and
to ſhew how they ſtood in Relation each to other.</p>
            <p>And this I have Attempted by way of Aphoriſm,
becauſe I have thought that the moſt Conciſe Method
of Arguing; and which (if the Writer be not Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken
in his Propoſitions) cannot fail of Leading
People to the Truth, without a Multitude of Words,
which in Diſcourſes of this Nature eſpecially, doth more
often Puzle the Cauſe than give a Clear Underſtanding
of the Matter.</p>
            <p>Such then as I have been able to make them, I take
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106790:8"/>
the Liberty humbly to Offer them to your Honours Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſal,
with a Reſolution never to trouble the Publick
with them, unleſs they may ſeem ſo Valuable as to paſs
the Teſt of your Honours Judgment.</p>
            <p>;Yet for as much I have been Neceſſitated to confine
my ſelf to Shortneſs, and only carry on my Argument
in General Terms, I think it needful to add ſome few
Remarks, partly for Explanation, and partly to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
the Diſcourſe with ſome neceſſary Additions Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable
to the preſent Circumſtances of our Nation,
which the Brevity of the Aphoriſms would not admit:
With which I ſhall proceed in order.</p>
            <p>In the Second Chapter then I take Notice of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Managements of Trade between Nation and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and conclude that the Profit of a Trading Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
is not to be Reckon'd from their Trade with any one
Countrey, but from the Ballance of their Trade in
General.</p>
            <p>To Illuſtrate which Argument, I will Inſtance in the
Trade of this Nation with <hi>France</hi> in time of Peace, from
whence we brought a far greater Value of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
than they Receiv'd of ours; ſo that the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
of that Trade was in that reſpect Apparently to our
Loſs: Yet when it ſhall be Conſidered that we ſent a
greater Over Ballance of our Product to <hi>Spain, Holland,</hi>
and <hi>Germany,</hi> than we Required of their Productions;
it will appear, that we had no need of ſending out
our Bullion, but that we could Supply our Occaſions
in <hi>France,</hi> by Remitting thither by Bills of Exchange, the
Over Ballance of Trade which we had with thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.
And the Advantages we made to our ſelves by the
<hi>French</hi> Trade was, That it Employ'd our Navigation,
and cauſed the Money of ſuch who Conſumed thoſe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106790:8"/>
               <hi>French</hi> Commodities to Circulate among Merchants,
and all Tradeſmen that had a dependance upon that Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
and to Contribute conſiderably to the Publick
Revenues ariſing by the Cuſtoms; neither may we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to drive a Publick Trade in the World without
ſome ſuch ſeeming Diſadvantages, with more Reaſon,
than that a Private Man ſhould Refuſe to Buy of his
Neighbour what his Neceſſity Requires, and he cannot
ſo conveniently procure from another, becauſe that
Neighbour hath no Occaſion to lay out any of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
with him.</p>
            <p>Yet to Apply this laſt Inſtance to our Trade with <hi>France,</hi>
'tis but Common Reaſon that we ſhould rather chuſe to
reject theirs, and uſe our ſelves to the Drinking of the
Wines of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> ſince they take off much
more of our Commodities than the <hi>French</hi> do; and
more eſpecially, ſince the laſt Prohibition with <hi>France</hi>
hath ſhewn us, that we might find out Wines in thoſe
Countries, which are better in their own Nature, and
with uſe become even as pleaſing as thoſe of <hi>France.</hi>
And it might be a Thought not unworthy the Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of our Government, whether we may not Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
lay Four times the wonted Duty on <hi>French</hi>
Wines, when ever that Trade ſhall come to be Open;
to continue, until that Prince ſhall Recall that extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
Duty which before the War he laid upon our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures,
amounting to little leſs than a Prohibition.</p>
            <p>What I Hinted in the Twenty third Aphoriſm of this
Chapter, may be well Inſtanced in our Trade to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
whether we ſent conſiderable Quantities of Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion;
for which many People were apt to Cenſure that
Trade as wholly Prejudicial to the Nation: Yet if it
ſhall appear, that if that Buſineſs were well Managed,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:106790:9"/>
we ſhould be able to ſend ſo much of the Goods brought
from thence to our Neighbour Markets, as would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
us more Money and Moneys Worth than what we
firſt ſent out for <hi>India;</hi> they will then be fully Convinc'd
that ſuch Trades are not to be declin'd: And that we have
ſo done, is well known to thoſe who underſtand Trade.</p>
            <p>From the Conſideration of this Chapter alſo, may
well be Argued the Irrationality of any Peoples making
ſevere Laws to Prohibit the Tranſportation of their Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion:
For the Experience of all the World ſhews, That
whereſoever the Advantages of Trade require it, Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
do and will find ways enough for the Conveyance
of a Commodity whoſe Bulk is ſo ſmall. Neither can
it be any Prejudice to an Induſtrious Trading Nation,
becauſe the more Demand there is for its Exportation,
the higher the Price will be, and that never fails to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
the Merchants, whoſe Trade it ſuits with, to
Supply the Market with more.</p>
            <p>But if any one will take Occaſion here to tell me,
that People under this Liberty, may come to carry out
more Bullion than they bring in; I have ſhewn in the
Fifth Chapter, That any Nation that ſhall continue to
do ſo, muſt infallibly ruine themſelves in time: But then
I cannot call that an Induſtrious, but an Improvident
Nation.</p>
            <p>The Third Chapter is to Convince ſuch of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake,
who may think that Foreigners are Governed by
the Computation or Value we put upon our Coins;
and that if we Raiſe its Worth amongſt our ſelves, they
muſt be oblig'd to Eſteem it at the ſame Rate, or elſe
cannot afford to carry it from us; whereas I think no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more plain, than that the Weight is the only
True Standard of its Value; and if we ſhould make our
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106790:9"/>
Crowns to paſs for Five Shillings and Six Pence, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
muſt Advance juſt Ten <hi>per Cent.</hi> more to anſwer
it; becauſe (as it is ſhewn in the Fifth Chapter) if we have
occaſion to ſend out Bullion for the payment of our Bills,
we muſt ſend ſo much in Weight as will make up the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
which Foreigners expect from us; and conſequently
not one Ounce the leſs will be ſent out while our Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
require it Abroad: And then the effect upon our
ſelves will be, That every Man will be really ſo much the
Poorer, as he ſhall become Poſſeſſour of ſo much the leſs
Weight of Bullion for the Commodities he parts from:
Which I take to be a general Declination of Riches in a
Nation.</p>
            <p>The Fourth Chapter ſhews the Cauſe and Nature of
Exchanges; and that though ſome Men have skill to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
that kind of buſineſs to a competent Advantage,
yet there can be no ſuch Miracles wrought by it, as an
Ancient Writer hath imagined; becauſe it is wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced
by the Ballance of Trade between Nation and
Nation; and when that falls ſhort, it muſt be ſupplied
by the ſending of Bullion: For that there muſt always
be a Value to anſwer the Draught, or elſe the Credit will
be broken: For the Drawing and Re-drawing without a
Fund, is only a Trick of neceſſitous Men, and if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
will end in Loſs and Ruine.</p>
            <p>The Fifth Treats of the Riſing and Falling of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
and Bullion: And what I ſhall here take Notice of
on that Head, is the extraordinary Emergencies which
cauſe a conſiderable Advance thereon; and this can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
happen, but when a Nation hath occaſion to ſend
out more Bullion than it receives in from Abroad: And
theſe may be reckon'd the Unnatural Affects of Trade,
and are like Convulſions in the Body, the continuance
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106790:10"/>
whereof cannot but be Dangerous; and the way to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
them, is not to begin with the Effect (as I have
before Obſerved, in ſhewing the Deficiency of Prohibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Exportation, or Advancing the Value of the Coin, <hi>&amp;c</hi>)
but to apply ſuch means as may take away the Cauſe.</p>
            <p>How the Caſe is with us is no Myſtery, becauſe 'tis
Evident, That the Charge of Maintaining our Army
Abroad doth exceed the Ballance of our Trade; yet the
inevitable Neceſſity for that is ſuch, That no Man who
loves his Countrey can grudge the Expence, becauſe
we are thereby preſerved from the Devaſtations, Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derings,
Sackings, Burning, and Slaughter, which we
muſt have been Subject to, if the Seat of War had not
been kept out of our own Countrey.</p>
            <p>And indeed nothing could have given ſo great an
Evidence of the incredible Riches of this Nation, as the
being able to bear ſo great a real Expence (for I call
not that ſo which Circulates amongſt our ſelves) ſo
many Years, with ſo few Inconveniences as we have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
felt: So that we may yet think no worſe of our
ſelves, than we would ſay of a Nobleman that might have
Ten thouſand Pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> and One hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Pounds in his Purſe, if he ſhould be forc'd to Spend
Fourty thouſand Pounds of it in the Defence of his juſt
Title to his Eſtate, that he yet remains in a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>However the Continuation of this Expence muſt in
time prove more Injurious; and therefore it cannot be
amiſs to think of ſome Expedients that might make the
lengthening of the War leſs burdenſom to us: To which
I ſhould freely offer my Mite, but that I fear to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
my Line; leſt I might juſtly Incur the Cenſure due
to ſuch, who being over confident of their own Notions,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106790:10"/>
Expoſe themſelves, by publiſhing their Thoughts, before
they have tried the Soundneſs of them, by Converſing
with other Men of better Judgments in thoſe Matters
than themſelves.</p>
            <p>But as to the buſineſs of Carrying out our Bullion,
(excepting our preſent Occaſion of Paying our Army
Abroad) we of all Nations of <hi>Europe</hi> have leaſt reaſon
to be apprehenſive of it; becauſe our own Native Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
are ſo Valuable in moſt Foreign Markets, that
they turn to much more Profit than the Carrying of
Money would.</p>
            <p>The laſt Chapter Diſcourſes of the Abuſes of Money,
and I think needs no Explanation till I come to the Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſeventh and Sixty eighth Aphoriſm; and I will only
add to that, That I think upon mature Conſultation,
ſuch a Scheme might be fram'd from that Foundation,
that might effectually anſwer the Deſign. For it is to be
conſidered, That upon the New Coining of the Money,
moſt Payments would be made in the Mill'd Crowns,
and Half-Crowns, or in the Old Money of its true
Weight; and People would immediately learn to Try
all their Money, both by the Scales and the Calliper,
ſo that few Pieces would eſcape Three Hands; for it
would behove all People to be very Exact and Curious,
both to avoid the Loſs and the Suſpicion that the offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Bad Money would ſubject them to. And though
this Method at the firſt may ſeem troubleſom, yet 'tis
to be Conſidered that in paying Sums, there would be
no need to try many Pieces, ſo that the trouble would
indeed be leſs than now it is; beſides the Loſs would be
avoided, and a little time would quite put a ſtop to it.</p>
            <p>And I will here take Occaſion to ſuggeſt a Thought
which I have had for the Putting a Speedy End to the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106790:11"/>
Vexation, Trouble and Loſs that People Daily Endure
by the Abominable Money which they are forc'd to
Receive; the Currant Caſh of the Nation being in a
manner quite Spoiled by Clipping, or by the introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
a ſort of Counterfeit Money, even worſe than
that, which daily increaſes upon us, and will continue
ſo to do as long as any Clipt Money ſhall be permitted
to Paſs.</p>
            <p>I would Propoſe then, That the Government ſhould
Iſſue a Proclamation, Declaring, That for the putting
a ſtop to the Abuſes of the Money, the Laws ſhould
be put in Execution againſt any Perſon that ſhould
preſume to offer any Clipt Money after a certain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixt
Day.</p>
            <p>But that for the eaſe of the People, Officers ſhould
be Appointed in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> for that City,
and Parts Adjacent; and a convenient Place ſhould be
Appointed by the Magiſtrates in all the Cities and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
Towns through the reſt of the Nation, where the
like Officers ſhould Attend to Receive in all the Good
Clipt Money that ſhould be brought them; and that
they ſhould Enter the Sum and Weight of every Mans
Parcel in a Book, and Seal the ſame up in Bags, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them as many Certificates as they pleaſe in Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to the Amount of the Sum they brought in.</p>
            <p>Theſe Certificates, with an Indorſement, ſhould be
delivered from Man to Man in Payments: But if any
one ſhould doubt the verity thereof, he might go to
the Officer and Examine it.</p>
            <p>If any Man ſhall Refuſe theſe Certificates, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
to be Paid the Money in <hi>Specie,</hi> the Debter
ſhould only be obliged to carry him to the Officer,
and calling for the Bag Certified, count it over to him
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106790:11"/>
before the Officer, and ſo diſcharge himſelf; the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer
Sealing the Bag again, as before.</p>
            <p>If any Perſons ſhould not like to have their Money
kept in ſuch Appointed Place, they ſhould have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to keep it themſelves, or lodge it where they
pleaſe, but not to open the Seal but in the preſence
of the Officer: Yet it is rather to be ſuppoſed that the
Money would be in leſs danger of Thieves, by being kept
in a Strong Place, ſecured by the Publick, than if it were
kept in Private Houſes: Neither can the Sum be ſo large,
as to Encourage a great number to make any attempt
upon it; for there are above Eight hundred Market-Towns
in the Nation, which having One thouſand Pounds
one with the other, would make Eight hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Pounds; which perhaps may be double as much as
will be found, out of <hi>London,</hi> and Three or Four of the
other Cities; and 'tis certain that the moſt will always
be in the largeſt Towns, and therefore moſt Secure.</p>
            <p>The trouble of this will be leſs than might at firſt be
imagined; for all people of buſineſs in the Countrey gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
Meet at the Market, where the Officers ſhould give
their attendance: So that this buſineſs would be diſpatcht
with as much eaſe as people could do it at home, and with
no hazard of loſing by Bad Money. Neither would there
be any injury offered to any Man, for he that will keep
his Money himſelf may; he that is content to take the
Endorſed Certificates, cannot be unſecure, becauſe the
Fund for them is unqueſtionable, being no leſs than the
very ſame Money, which otherwiſe he ſhould have received
in <hi>Specie;</hi> and he that deſires to receive his Money by Tale,
as before, may continue to do ſo, only he muſt ſubmit to
the trouble of doing it before an Officer, which no honeſt
Man can think too much for the preventing ſuch a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:106790:12"/>
Alſo when there may be Occaſion to carry Money
from one Place to another, the Perſon ſhould have his
Money Told over and Seal'd up a new, his Old Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate
Cancell'd, his Credit in the Book Diſcharg'd,
and another Certificate given, mentioning to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to ſuch a Place; and the Officer, Appointed for that
Place, ſhould Receive it, Enter it in his Book, and Give
him Certificates thereof as before: But to prevent A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes,
any Perſon, not well known, ſhould be Obliged
to bring ſome Credible Perſon of the Place to Vouch for
his Honeſty.</p>
            <p>Some may Object, That Money will be wanting to
Supply the Running Caſh; but the Project it ſelf An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
them, if they Conſider, That all the Money conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
to have the Effect of Running Caſh; for every one
may take the Certificate as Low as he pleaſes; and then
the Circulation of a very little Broad Money, will
ſerve the Occaſion of daily Expences; of which there
could be no want: For beſides, that moſt People will
be able to Pick out ſome Broad Money out of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
they have in their Cuſtody; thoſe people who
have been able to keep Money by them, have made
ſuch ſorry Money, as they are forc'd to take, ſerve for
their Neceſſary Payments, and laid up the beſt; which
they will not ſcruple to bring out, when they ſhall
be Aſſured that no more can be Clipt. And from this
Reaſon it may well be ſuppoſed, That the Quantity of
Clipt Money will prove much leſs than is generally
thought.</p>
            <p>Yet if the want of Changing Money, as I may call it,
proves ſomewhat troubleſom in ſome Places, People
might and would Invent Ways of helping themſelves;
and this might be much better born for a while, than
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106790:12"/>
the Continuation of ſo great a Loſs, which we ſee daily
Growing upon us. As for the Poor, the Overſeers may
be Oblig'd to Change what ſmall Matter they have out
of the Pariſh Stock.</p>
            <p>Alſo if this Method were put in Practice, an exact
Account would be taken of all the Clipt Money in the
Kingdom againſt the next Seſſions of Parliament; which
would much facilitate their Settling ſuch a certain Tax
upon the Publick, as would make good the Loſs, and give
every Man New Mill'd Weighty Money for the Clipt
Money he had brought in; likewiſe the preſent Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
Money would be deſtroy'd, becauſe 'tis all Clipt.</p>
            <p>Neither need the Government be put to any Charge,
for 'tis Preſum'd, that no People who are Perplext with
the Baſe Money, which now they muſt take, will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think
the giving Two Pence in the Pound to be eaſed
of that Trouble and Loſs; which 'tis probable might De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray
the whole Charge of this Management.</p>
            <p>I will add but one thing more, and that is my Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
on the late Riſe of Guineas amongſt us, and the
Ill Conſequence that attends it.</p>
            <p>The Reaſon that is pretended for this, is the Badneſs
of the Silver Money; when as People ſhould Conſider,
That 'tis their own Fault if they Receive the Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
Money; and for the Clipt, they may be ſure to have
it Exchang'd for Good Money without Loſs, when the
Parliament can Settle it; and then conſequently (if not
before) Guineas will fall again: But there will be no
Reparation for the great Loſs which ſuch muſt ſuffer,
who ſhall have Quantities of them Remaining on their
Hands.</p>
            <p>But ſome Argue, That Gold is Riſen Proportionably, and
therefore the Price of Guineas muſt keep up; and that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106790:13"/>
this doth not only keep our own Guineas at Home, but
alſo cauſe them to be brought over to us from <hi>Holland</hi>
and other Places whither they were carried.</p>
            <p>But to Anſwer theſe, Gold is only Riſen amongſt us,
becauſe of the Riſe of Guineas: And though this may
make Gold to Advance alſo ſomething in our Neighbour
Countreys, when they ſee us ſo Imprudent to take it
from them at ſo high a Price; yet their Advance is
through our Demand, and we ſhall find in the end
that we may Buy Gold too Dear; which our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
of <hi>Holland</hi> have Wit enough to know, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they will Coin all the Gold of their own Countrey
into Guineas for us, if we will give them (as we lately
did) Five Ounces of our Standard Silver for a Guinea,
which a little time before they would part with for
Four Ounces: but as there is a Neceſſity for ſending out
Bullion for the Payment of our Army, ſo if this alſo
continues, we may be ſure to have but little Silver left in
a ſhort time; and both our Silver and the Exchange to
<hi>Holland</hi> is already Advanced, yet more in our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favour
by this Occaſion.
<note n="*" place="margin">I am not Ignorant that it's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon among Merchants to call the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change to <hi>Holland</hi> Falling, when the <hi>Dutch</hi> give fewer <hi>Schillings</hi> for our Pound, and this indeed may well be Reckon'd Falling in their Favour; but with reſpect to us, if we could for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly Purchaſe Thirty five <hi>Schillings</hi> for our Twenty Shillings, whereas we muſt now Pay Twenty five Shillings for the like Number of <hi>Dutch Schil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,</hi> I am ſure we may more Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſay 'tis Riſen Twenty five <hi>per Cent.</hi> to us.</note> Neither ſhall we be ſo
Rich as thoſe People ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
by having ſuch High
Prized Gold in the ſtead
on't; for thoſe that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
it, will find their Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
lighter than they would
have been at the Old Rate,
by near One Third; and
thoſe that ſhould ſend it to
<hi>India</hi> (for we ſend little or
none to any other Parts) would find that thoſe People
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106790:13"/>
will give them no more of their Commodities for it,
than it would Purchaſe when it Coſt them but Four
Pounds <hi>per</hi> Ounce at Home; and whether then it may
not be more likely to Fall again to the Old Price, than
to keep up, let all Prudent Men Judge. Moreover
all that now have them, know that they are Held up at
a Strain'd Value; and though they are forc'd to take
them in Payment, or be without their Money, yet eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Man is willing to be rid of them as ſoon as he can:
So that when once they begin to fall, all People will be
for parting with them before they come Lower, and ſo
they will come to tumble down faſter than at firſt they
Roſe. And all theſe Inconveniencies are brought upon
us by certain Tricking Men amongſt us, that having the
Command of large Caſhes, do contrive, by ſuch Means,
the Raiſing great Advantages to themſelves by the
greater Injury of the Publick; and I am ſorry to ſee that
People are content ſo tamely to Submit thereto, and do
not repreſent theſe Miſchievous Practices to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in order to ſtir them up to Apply ſome ſpeedy
Remedy.</p>
            <p>But before I have quite done, I will Offer One Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
more, to ſhew that notwithſtanding what any
particular Government may do amongſt their own
People, it will yet be impoſſible to make a greater Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
on the Value of Silver and Gold through <hi>Europe;</hi>
becauſe the great Supplies thereof, which have been
brought into theſe Parts of the World, ſince the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of thoſe Rich Mines in <hi>America</hi> by the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi>
have made it much more Plenty than it was
in former Ages; and while theſe Mines continue,
we may always expect a greater Increaſe; by which
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106790:14"/>
Means its Value may come to be leſs, but can never
be more.<note n="*" place="bottom">Since Writing the above, I am Inform'd by very Worthy and Knowing Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, That within late Years, very Rich Mines of Gold have been Open'd in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies;</hi> ſo that we ſhould not only have no need hereafter to ſend Gold thither, but that Gold might be brought from thence Purchas'd with Silver, to yield in <hi>Europe</hi> Sixty to Eighty <hi>per Cent.</hi> Profit; from whence we may certainly expect, That the Value of Gold muſt, in ſome ſhort time, become of leſs Worth in Proportion to Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver than it hath been formerly.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And let me add (though it be a Digreſſion)
That the Trading Nations do get the greateſt Share
of this; which is the Cauſe why we ſee that the
Potentates of thoſe Trading Nations, are become
much more Powerful, being able to Maintain far
greater Forces than they could in the laſt Age:
Whereas on the contrary, we may Obſerve ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Great Governments, who throught the Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
Expence of their own Treaſure, and for want
of Trade, and Induſtry to Acquire to themſelves
a Proportion of this General Increaſe of Riches, are
extreamly Declin'd in their Strength, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
their Territories may not be much leſs, nor
the People they Govern fewer than they were
formerly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May it pleaſe your Honour,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Thoughts on theſe things would Carry me
much farther; but when I Conſider that I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
Toucht at divers Great and Weighty Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
with too Unskilful a Hand, I think I have Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:106790:14"/>
ſhall Cloſe my Diſcourſe with a Good Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
made by a late Ingenious Author; That ſo
Curious a Subject as Trade is, would not have want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
many Excellent Diſcourſes, to ſhew the great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
it brings to a Nation, and the Proper Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
to ſeek its Improvements; but that Men of
Learning are but little Acquainted with it; and thoſe
that are in the Practice of it, do, for the moſt part,
either want Ability or Leiſure from their Private Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
to do their Countrey that Right. And though
I have addicted my ſelf to Search after the True No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of theſe Matters, beyond many other Merchants,
who have their Heads continually filled with Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
yet I ſee my ſelf ſo Defective in theſe Reſpects,
that I can rather Wiſh, than ever Hope to be Maſter
of thoſe Accompliſhments, that might Render me Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of Expreſſing my Thoughts with leſs Difficulty
to my ſelf, and more Clearneſs to others; And from
this Reaſon it is, that I can never Read over what I
have Written, without Mending ſome Faults, or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpying
others that I have not Skill enough to help:
And I cannot but expect, that all Men, of your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours

APPENDIX
<hi>Offering ſome further Reaſons againſt Raiſing the
Value of our COIN.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE foregoing Papers were written laſt Summer, in hopes
that they might have been of Service, in order to the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
ſome Stop to the daily Increaſing Abuſe of our Money,
and the Injury accruing to the Nation by the Extravagant
Riſe of Gold: But finding that the Government did not think fit to
meddle in ſo Weighty a Matter out of Parliament, the Publication
was omitted till the Opening of the preſent Seſſion.</p>
            <p>But ſince my having finiſht the former part of this Diſcourſe,
Mr. <hi>Lowndes,</hi> Secretary to the Right Honourable the Lords of the
Treaſury, and a Worthy Member of the preſent Honourable Houſe
of Commons, did me the Honour to ſhew me a Tract of his upon
the ſame Subject; in which he hath given a very Exact Dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the various Alterations that have been made in the Coins
of this Nation, ſince the firſt Inſtitution of our Mints; ſhewing
the Meaſures that have been taken from time to time for Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
the Abuſes of the Money; and Propoſing a Method for the
Rectifying the preſent Defects thereof: The whole Diſcourſe being
moſt Ingeniouſly performed, and furniſht with many Excellent
Notions on that Subject, worthy the Obſervation of all Curious
Perſons.</p>
            <p>Yet, as he propoſes that in Conſideration of the preſent high
Price of Bullion, our Money ought to be made adequate thereto,
that thereby Encouragement may be given for People to bring in
their Silver to the Mint, and that there may be no Temptation here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
for the Melting down or Exporting our Coin: having already
given my Opinion ſo contrary thereto in the foregoing Diſcourſe,
I cannot yet bring my Judgment to agree with him for the Raiſing
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106790:16"/>
of our Money to 25 <hi>per Cent.</hi> above its former Value: although I
will confeſs, That I think the Syſtem which he hath fram'd for the
Effecting the Matter in that way, to be the moſt compleat that
can be, if it ſhall be thought abſolutely neceſſary for us to proceed
upon the Foundation of Raiſing the Value of our Money.</p>
            <p>And although I am not willing to contravert this Point with a
Perſon, whoſe Abilities I eſteem ſo much beyond my own; yet
foraſmuh as I expect this Matter will become the Serious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
of the Parliament; and that I am very confident that that
Worthy Gentleman will readily Acquieſce in whatſoever ſhall be
thought moſt Expedient for the Publick Good; I cannot think it
will be any Offence to him, if I here add ſome Reaſons why I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to Diſſent from him in that Notion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> then, I doubt it will not in the leaſt meaſure prevent
the Carrying out of our Bullion, or Exporting our Coin; becauſe
(as I have already ſhewn) if our Occaſions ſhall continue to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
more Money Abroad than doth ariſe from the Ballance of our
Trade, there can be no other way of Supplying it, than by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Overplus in Bullion; and this muſt be had in the full
Quantity by Weight which ſhall be wanted: And therefore, if we
ſhould advance the Value of our Money, ſo as to make our preſent
Crown paſs amongſt our ſelves for Seven ſhillings Six pence or
more, the Price of our Bullion would yet be ſomewhat higher.
For I believe it may be admitted for a certain Rule, That whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
there is ſuch a Demand, the Price of Bullion will always advance
ſomething above our Coin'd Money, becauſe of the Penalty and
Hazard that attends the Melting or Tranſporting the latter; and
yet notwithſtanding that Hazard, we ſee People are not to be
deterr'd from it, when a conſiderable Profit tempts them thereto, by
the Price of Bullion riſing much above it; ſo that it ſeems to
me altogether as impoſſible to find out any Regulation that can
keep our Silver, either Coin'd or Uncoin'd, at Home, whenſoever
our Neceſſities Abroad demand a greater Value than the produce
of all our Merchandize Exported can furniſh; as to take away the
Effect, while the Cauſe remains.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I think that an Advance of Twenty five <hi>per Cent.</hi> upon our
Money, if it hath any Effect at all upon us, muſt tend very much
to the Impoveriſhment of the Nation; to confirm which Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
two Dilemma's will offer themſelves, and I know not how they
can be avoided.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:106790:16"/>
For, if the Species of our Coin be Rais'd to paſs for one fourth
part more than formerly, either the Price of the Product of our
Lands and Labour will riſe in the ſame Proportion thereto, or
elſe they will be bought for one fourth part leſs than the due
Weight of our preſent Coin.</p>
            <p>Now if it may be ſuppos'd that our Product will riſe in the
ſame Proportion, then this Alteration will conduce nothing, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the Multiplying of the Currant Caſh neceſſary for the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
of our Trade (becauſe every Man will have need of the
ſame Quantity of Silver and Gold in Weight as before) or to the
giving any Encouragement for the bringing in of Silver from
Abroad, becauſe it would really buy no more of our Goods to
Tranſport than it did before: So that thus the Difference would
be nothing more to us than in the Computation, and will only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in the Swelling of the Figures of our Accompts.</p>
            <p>But if this Alteration ſhall obtain, to Cauſe the Product of
our Lands and Labour to be ſold for the ſame Computation of
Pounds, Shillings and Pence, as now, although the Coin will be
one quarter part leſs in weight; it muſt conſequently have a very
fatal Influence upon the Trade, from whence we draw all our
Wealth. For to inſtance in the Trade of <hi>Spain</hi> (becauſe that is
as the Fountain of Silver and Gold to all <hi>Europe</hi>) when the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
ſhall come to find that his Bullion Imported thence, will
purchaſe in <hi>England</hi> one quarter part of our Commodities more
than formerly, the Encouragement by this extravagant Profit will
be ſo great, That not only our own, but foreign Merchants alſo,
will preſently be at it, and bring all their Bullion hither to lay
out in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Goods. And this will certainly be a Brave Trade,
and will ſeem to anſwer the end of drawing in Silver and Gold to
us for a while: But what will follow? Why, in a few Months
time, the multitude of Seekers after this profitable Trade, will
have crouded the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Markets with ſuch gluts of our Goods,
that they'll preſently find out the blind ſide, and will infallibly take
Occaſion by the Over-plenty of Goods at Market, to beat down
the Prices, even lower than the Twenty Five <hi>per Cent.</hi> which he
hop'd he had gain'd by the Laying out his Money in <hi>England;</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will they ever rife again higher than juſt to afford ſuch a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
<hi>pro rato,</hi> to the Money, which us'd to content the Merchant,
when he formerly kept jogging on in his <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Trade: So here
our violent Start will laſt but a little while, and ever after we muſt
not expect, that the Product of our Nation will afford us, in Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:106790:17"/>
Countries, any more than three quarter parts of the value it
yielded before this Alteration.</p>
            <p>But the Miſchief will not end here; for Foreigners will not be
hereby perſwaded to part with what we want of their Product, for
leſs weight of Bullion than they us'd to have before; ſo that if we
formerly could afford to conſume amongſt our ſelves, above three
quarter parts of the Produce of our Foreign Exports (which I
doubt we did, and yet were good Gainers by our Trade too) we
ſhall then come to ſpend more than our Income; which I am ſure
will be the way to impoveriſh us quickly, unleſs we alter our
Courſe of Living, which a Nation that hath long been us'd to ſuch
Plenty, is not apt to be brought to.</p>
            <p>Let us ſee then how this will operate amongſt us at home: The
Labourer and Manufacturer muſt come to take leſs weight of Silver
for their Wages, and yet muſt continue to pay the ſame weight as
formerly, for what Foreign Commodities they ſpend; whereby they
will be reduc'd to a neceſſity of faring harder, and ſpending leſs in
Proviſions, which muſt cauſe the Product, and conſequently the
Rents of our Lands to fall in the ſame Proportion. The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
then, who lives upon the Rents of his Lands, muſt expect they
will fall one fourth part in their yearly Value, and yet he muſt
give at leaſt Twenty five <hi>per Cent</hi> more for all the Foreign Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
he ſpends, which to Perſons of that Rank, may modeſtly be
computed to affect them Ten <hi>per Cent.</hi> more; ſo that hereby they
will be reduc'd above one third part of their Subſiſtance.</p>
            <p>But what is yet worſe, there will be a ſtop put to the Increaſe
of our Riches ariſing from Foreign Trade, the only Source of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Wealth; and that muſt reduce the Strength and Power of
the Kingdom, and make us unable to reſiſt the Inſults of ſuch of
our Neighbours, who ſhall uſe more prudent Methods for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing
Plenty of Gold and Silver among them: And indeed I
cannot determine wherein the Happineſs of a Nation, Rich in that
kind of Wealth conſiſts, above others, which abound in plenty of
all things neceſſary for human Life, only in that the former are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
to ſuſtain the chargeable Proviſions of War, as it is now ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd,
when as the latter muſt be enforc'd to ſubmit to the Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of others, for want of ſuch means to defend themſelves; there
being nothing more plain, than that according to the preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of theſe Parts of the World, he that hath the longeſt Purſe,
will certainly have the longeſt Sword.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:106790:17"/>
But here will now ariſe another Dilemma; for, either this Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
muſt continue amongſt us, or our Money will come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
to its former Standard of Value. If the Alteration continues,
and have its effect, I think the fatal conſequences ſhewn in the
foregoing Argument cannot be avoided: But if the Coin ſhall, after
ſuch an Alteration, return again to its old adjuſtment, manifold
injuries and inconveniencies muſt attend it, of which, I will offer
a few Inſtances:</p>
            <p>If a Man hath lent Two thouſand pounds upon Perſonal or Land
Security, the Debter ſhall upon this Regulation be able to pay off
his Debt with ſuch Money as will be really worth but One thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
ſix hundred Pounds; and on the other hand, if a Man borrow
Two thouſand Pounds of this Regulated Money, and continue the
Debt till the Money be again reform'd to its former Value, it will
coſt him Five hundred pounds more than he at firſt receiv'd, to
pay off this Debt of Two thouſand pounds. All Debts due from
the Crown, will be paid to the Lenders in one fourth part leſs
Value than the Money Lent; ſo likewiſe what Moneys the Crown
may Borrow under the Regulation, muſt be paid again after the
Reformation thereof, with the Addition of one fourth part Value
more than Borrowed. All Tradeſmen muſt on the Regulation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
but three fourth parts real Value for all the Debts they have
truſted out; but on the Reformation, all People that owe Money
to the Tradeſmen, muſt really pay one quarter part more than
the Value of what they bought. Now as 'tis not to be thought
but that this Loſs and Gain will fall very unequally among the
Maſs of the People, according as the Accidents of their Affairs
may bring them under the Influence of it; let us next Conſider
what Profit the Crafty Money'd Men may infallibly raiſe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
by taking the Natural Advantages of ſuch Alterations of
our Money. Suppoſe then a Banker, worth Twenty thouſand
pounds of his own Eſtate, had a Proſpect of this Riſe, it will
eaſily be allow'd, that ſuch an one by Drawing in all the Money
he could into his Hands, might certainly command Sixty thouſand
pounds, by which Sum he will immediately upon the Propos'd
Advance, gain Fifteen thouſand Pounds Profit, and whenſoever he ſhall
be Apprehenſive of a Reformation of the Money to its old Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard,
he may pay off his Debts in the Light Money, and lay out
his own Eſtate on good Securities or Purchaſe of Lands, till it
will bring him in the ſame Sum in Heavy Money, and ſo Secure
him in the aforeſaid Profit. In like manner, Foreigners may on
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:106790:18"/>
the Proſpect of ſo large a Profit (beſides the Common Intereſt)
bring Money into our Nation to let out on Valuable Securities,
while this Regulation continues; but when the ſame is Reform'd,
will be paid again in Money worth Twenty five <hi>per Cent.</hi> more
than what he Lent; which will be ſo much clear loſs to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in as much as they Carry away from us both Principal and
Profit. I ſhall only Note further, That it will be in this as in the
Caſe of Guineas, that as ſome will ſeem to get, and none to loſe
by it in the Beginning, the People will admit it to be introduc'd
without any uneaſineſs; but when the Money ſhall come to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
again, the Loſs will affect them ſo generally, that it may
endanger the Raiſing of Mutinies and Diſturbances among the
People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> With Submiſſion to better Judgments, I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that better and more effectual Methods may be provided, for
the bringing down the Price of Bullion, and making it near Adequate
to the Value of our Currant Coin; which (as that Worthy Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
well Obſerves) will be the proper Means to prevent the
Melting down of the one, and hindring the Exportation of th'other.
And that would be by bringing our Affairs into ſuch a poſture, as
that our Expences Abroad may be kept within the Compaſs of
the Ballance of our Trade: For this, and this only, will be able
to take away the Evil by the Cauſe; and is of that Abſolute
Neceſſity, that without it 'twill be impoſſible for us to Maintain
an Army Abroad much longer, without being Drain'd of all the
Riches in the Kingdom. Which being a Matter of that great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
if I ſhould, (contrary to my Intent in the firſt Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of theſe Papers) preſume to Suggeſt my Thoughts of ſuch
Courſes as may be requiſite to be put in Practice in order to attain
that End; I hope I ſhall at leaſt deſerve Pardon, if I may be miſtaken
in any of them; ſince the deep Senſe I have of the Injury daily
accrewing to the Nation under the preſent Methods, and my not
having ſeen any thing of that Kind offer'd by Abler Hands, is what
prevails upon me thus to Expoſe my Humble Opinion to the Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny
of Stronger Judgments. What then occurs to me as fit
Meaſures to be taken, in order to bring our Expence within the
Compaſs of the Ballance of our Trade, I ſhall recommend in the
following Particulars:</p>
            <p n="1">1. By ſending all Proviſions neceſſary for the Suſtenance of our
Army Abroad, as full and compleat as we provide for our
Seamen on Board our Ships; by which Means, and by Leſſening the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:106790:18"/>
Subſiſtence of the Officers to what ſhould be but of abſolute Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Reducing alſo all their unneceſſary Equipages (which would
be much to their Advantage) 'tis probable we might Suſtain
our Army for leſs than one half of the Money we now pay A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.
If it ſhould be Objected, That all ſuch Proviſions may be
had Cheaper there than we can ſend them from hence; let it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
That if we loſt Twenty <hi>per Cent.</hi> in the Coſt (which is
not to be ſuppos'd) the Nation yet Gains Eighty <hi>per Cent.</hi> by
keeping ſo much Money at Home: for whatſoever is ſent out of
the Kingdom, is ſo much clear loſs to it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It might be Reaſonable, That ſince the Maintaining ſo great
an Army Abroad is very Injurious to us being an Iſland, That our
Confederates the <hi>Dutch</hi> might be prevail'd with to make ſome
Commutation with us, by their taking ſome Regiments off our
Hands into their Pay, and we to take upon us and Excuſe them
from as much or more Charge in the Sea-Service: all which would
be ſo much ſav'd to us, whilſt the Money Circulates amongſt us at
Home, and no Injury to them; becauſe by a Treaty on this Foot,
we might afford, even ſomewhat to leſſen theirs, and heighten
our own <hi>Quota</hi> of the general Charge of the War.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By Leſſening our Expence of ſuch Foreign Commodities which
we can well be without; which may be Effected by Prohibiting
for a time the Importation of all ſorts of Red Wines, and all other
ſorts of Fruit and Wines, except ſuch as are of the Growth of
<hi>Spain</hi> or the <hi>Rhine;</hi> all ſorts of Fine Linens, and all other Linens,
except ſome few ſorts to be particularly named; all kinds of
Silk Manufactured Abroad (except what comes from <hi>India</hi>) and
making it Penal to Sell or Wear ſuch, or
any ſort of Foreign Lace<note n="*" place="margin">I know this may be Thought Hard to ſome People, whoſe Trades chiefly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon ſuch Commodities: But I think we ought to have more Regard to the Publick Good of our Countrey, than to any ſuch, who will not be Content for its ſake to Divert their Trades, and Shift as well as they can for a Year or two.</note>. For all
theſe things, conducing but to Luxury,
people may very well content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
for a while without them, when
the Publick Weal of the Kingdom is
ſo much at Stake, eſpecially ſince they
will not be denied the Uſe of them but by degrees; for it may
be ſuppos'd that the Stock which will be in the Nation at the
time of ſuch Prohibition may laſt Two Years; by which time
'tis poſſible we may be in a better Condition to Indulge them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.
Moreover, by this Means the Product and Manufactures
of our own Countrey will be highly Encouraged, and perhaps
ſome of them be brought to that Perfection, as that we may
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:106790:19"/>
never more need Foreign of the ſame kind. If the Defect of
the Revenue ariſing from the Cuſtoms ſhould be Objected, we
ſhall be hereby Enabled the better to Supply that and more by other
Taxes.</p>
            <p n="4">4. By Reducing the price of Gold ſo, as that People may
not make Profit, by ſending out our Silver in Exchange for it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. By Regulating our Money, and bringing it to its juſt Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard;
by which Means the Exchanges between us and our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
will be brought to be near equal: Becauſe when the Money
of any Countrey is of its True known Weight and Goodneſs, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
fail to Obtain near the ſame Weight of the Money of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Countrey alike Fine upon Exchange, Allowance being only to
be made for the Time, Charge, Hazard and Profit of the Exchanger,
which is called the <hi>Praemio,</hi> and (as I have before ſhewn) can never
be great between Neighbour Nations; becauſe People would then
decline the Charge, and Tranſport their own Money, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Senſe tells every Man, muſt needs be Valued at its own
Weight in any Countrey. However, to prevent Exchangers
taking Advantage by the Demands of ſo great Sums, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may enjoyn that all the Money they want Abroad, may be
ſent in Coin (by which we could loſe but the Coinage, and that
too is Earn'd by our own People) whenever they cannot get it
Return'd by Exchange at a certain Moderate Rate to be ſet; and
this would Infallibly keep a Juſt Regulation upon the Prices of Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
and Exchanges, and Conſequently bring more Silver to the
Mint, eſpecially if ſome ſmall Encouragement of Two or Three
<hi>per Cent.</hi> were given by the Publick, when we find Running Caſh
Scarce among us.</p>
            <p n="6">6. By taking more Care in the Protection of our Trade than
hitherto hath been; for perhaps what we have Loſt this Year by
our <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Ships, would not have put us leſs than a
Million Value into Foreign Parts; and that would have ſav'd us
the ſending out of the ſame Value in Silver; which if it were duly
Conſidered by our Government, they might eaſily be perſwaded,
That no part of the Publick Charge could be better employ'd for
the Service of the Nation, than in taking due Care of our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
Ships.</p>
            <p>By what I have ſaid then, I hope it will be evident to all Men
that are Solicitous for the good of their Countrey, That unleſs
theſe or ſuch like Methods are taken, whereby we may be made
able to Support our Foreign Expence, without being Oblig'd to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:106790:19"/>
send out more Silver Yearly than we Receive in from the Product
of our Trade with other Countreys, the Scarcity of Bullion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us will become ſo great, that we ſhall ſoon be put under
an Incapacity of Maintaining the War. And, I believe, I may
further preſume to ſay, That the Nation might be able Longer,
and with more Eaſe, to bear Seven Millions <hi>per Annum</hi> in Taxes,
which ſhould only be Expended, and have their Circulation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
our ſelves, than to pay but one Million <hi>per Annum,</hi> to be
Exported in Silver while the Ballance of our Trade could bring us
in none. But could we once Effect this great Thing, of making
the Product of our Foreign Trade Support our Foreign Expence,
the War would not make the Nation Poor though it ſhould laſt
theſe Seven Years: And I hope this ſhort Eſſay hath given a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen,
how it may be poſſible for us to do ſo, if we have Virtue
enough to Retrench our Luxury, and Manage our Affairs with
Prudence and Integrity.</p>
            <p>And now, though I have done with this Argument, I cannot
yet finiſh, 'till I have added a further thought touching the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the Money, in which I heartily agree with that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Gentleman, earneſtly to recommend it as a Matter of Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to be done with as much Speed as Poſſible; neither do I think,
there can be a better Method than what he hath propoſed, by
Erecting Mints and Officers to Receive in, and New-Coin the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
in divers parts of the Kingdom: Yet I will beg leave to offer
as my humble Opinion, That we need not at preſent be over
Solicitous for the Coining more Silver than ſhall be Voluntarily
brought in; nor for the delivering to the Proprietors more New-Coin'd
Money than the Weight of the Silver they bring; and for
the Remainder, to give them Tickets Payable with Intereſt, upon
a certain Fond to be ſettled for that purpoſe, till the Nation may
better Spare Money to diſcharge the Principal; which would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be more Currant than Money it ſelf, by the conſtant grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Intereſt.</p>
            <p>But I know the Doubt is, That we ſhall not then have Money
enough to Circulate in Trade: In Anſwer to which, I would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
That Money may be conſidered to have a Threefold Uſe,
<hi>viz.</hi> for Treaſure, or Hoarding up; for Supplying the Uſe of
Trade in Groſs Sums; and for going to Market, or ſmall Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
The Poſſeſſors of the firſt ſort can never want Money, and
ſo they may be out of our Care. The Second is what requires
the greateſt Regard: And yet, even now, when Silver Money is
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:106790:20"/>
the moſt ſcarce that ever was known in our time, People do by
means of the Plenty of Gold, and the help of Goldſmiths and
Bank-Notes, for ought I can perceive, make their Payments well
enough: From whence I am inclin'd to think, that when, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the preſent Banks, the Land Banks alſo (which are now in
a fair way of being Eſtabliſhed) come to be opened, they will
Supply the place of Running Caſh as Largely, as ever it was in the
Plentieſt of Times; for I cannot but think, that Lands ſecurely
ſettled will be eſteem'd ſo Certain and Valuable a Fond for a
Bank, that it muſt obtain as Solid a Credit, as if the whole Value
were Coin'd into Money; and that it will become no leſs Service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in Trade. And when I further conſider, that our Clipt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
of the True Coin, was Plenty enough before the riſe of Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas,
and the Introduction of the Counterfeit Money that is now
ſo Common, but ſoon after did for the moſt part vaniſh away;
I am ready to Conclude, that upon the Apprehenſion of its being
Called in, and the Loſs made up by the Government, People choſe
to Lay it by, and make the Guineas and Falſe Money ſerve for
their Running Caſh, as what they were willing to be rid of, as ſoon
as they could, for fear of a Loſs at laſt; but in as much as the Clipt
Money is not worth the Melting down, I expect it will be brought
out again in greater Plenty than People may imagine from the
preſent Appearance of it, when it ſhall be Called in to be Chang'd;
neither is it to be doubted, but that conſiderable Quantities of the
Old Unclipt Money will appear again, when our Coin ſhall be
Regulated: So that I am of the Judgment, that by all theſe Means,
the Circulation of the Larger Payments will become much eaſier
than now: And then for the Leſſer Expences, ſo ſmall a Quantity
will Supply that Occaſion, that it cannot be wanting.</p>

            <head>POSTSCRIPT.</head>
            <p>UPon further Diſcourſe with the forementioned worthy Gentleman,
he offer'd me a very weighty Objection againſt the New-Coining
of our Money to the old Weight: For that the Nation is at this time
very Largely Indebted to Foreigners, as well for the great Quantities of
Gold they have of late brought us, as otherwiſe; which becauſe of the
high Price of Bullion, and the Exchange, they have not yet been able to
withdraw; but will certainly carry it away in the New Moneys, as ſoon as
the ſame ſhall be made of its old Weight. To which I can give no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Anſwer, than that I am ſorry that we have been ſo Negligent in not
Preventing the Cauſe; for I doubt the Conſequence is too Natural to be
eaſily avoided: And therefore I muſt refer it to abler Heads than my
own, to Conſider, Whether we were not even better to Submit to bear
that Loſs, than to draw upon our ſelves the Fatal Inconveniencies I
have before mentioned.</p>
            <p>Yet I will add a ſudden Thought, Whether we might not upon this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
lay a Temporary Duty of Sixpence <hi>per</hi> Ounce upon all Bullion to be
Tranſported; admitting none to be entred Out, but ſuch of which
due Proof was made of its Importation; and not only Confiſcating all
that ſhould be found Shipt without Entry, but adding very ſevere Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
upon all that ſhonld be Concern'd therein: And a little Diligence
in the Execution of this, might quickly Operate ſo far upon thoſe wary
People, who are the Common Traders that way, as that they might rather
chuſe to pay a Duty of Ten <hi>per Cent.</hi> than Run ſo great a Hazard with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it.</p>
