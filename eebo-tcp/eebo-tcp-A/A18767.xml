            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap> cleannesse of life. For the straunger the things are that our eyes behold, the more the impression of the minde is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly occupied about the vnderstanding of a wonder. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> oftener we sée mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelles, the more is Gods might made manifest, &amp; we the more affrayed to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend. But perhaps, some fine headed fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes will wrest (by naturall argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes) Gods doing and works, to a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or earthly operation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> procéeding from a hidden cause in the body and bowels of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth. As in déede of many other earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes before, hath bene written and throughly disputed: A reason that man
<pb facs="tcp:5361:3"/>
maketh, and a matter to be spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of, but not much to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended. Let such fine wittes search out secretes, and sift what they can from the bottome of their sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. Yet those that feare God, (and féele in their consciences a diuine motion fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the consideration of worldly wonders) will take the Earthquake to be of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinde of Nature: And beholding y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> myraculous manner of the same, with open armes, and humble heart, will em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Gods visitation, &amp; worthily wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the messanger he sendeth. Which assuredly cannot come, without his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, nor be séen without his heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will and pleasure. And this is much to be noted: If naturall causes onely compelled such Earthquaks (and procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red such tremblings,) then aswell in the wilde fieldes, as in the ciuill Townes, these alterations were often to be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. In déede many graue Auctors write, how mightie mountaines haue bene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued, &amp; whole Countreys haue bene drowned, by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> occasion of Earthquaks. But in those kingdomes, the Lorde of al Kinges (for some hidden iudgement to
<pb facs="tcp:5361:4"/>
himselfe) bore a greater sway in those causes and places, than any other natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral properties. And though that in many territories &amp; open fieldes (as good bookes make report) Earthquakes haue bene séene, and great hurt hath bene done: yet the harmes that come by Earthquakes in a ciuill towne (where God is honored and taketh care of his people) argues a maruellous mysterie, and perswades a further matter, than weake witted men may meddle withall. For sundry Cities haue soonk, &amp; millions of Houses, Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Towres, and walles, haue bene by Earthquake vtterly ouerthrowen. But commonly such wonders are séen, where all the world may be a witnesse of Gods great glory: and mans vnsuretie of life may be thorowly vnderstoode. Now if for all things that sodenly happen, a reason may be made, and naturall argumentes leade mans beléefe from the hope, feare, &amp; confidence in God, then though thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandes of wonders happened in a day, not one among ten thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d would thinke that God doth any thing at al, but as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural causes do fal out, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

both beginning and their end. God kéepe his chosen from such a conceit of chance, and beléefe of blindnesse. But now to be plaine, no threatning serueth a naughtie seruaunt, No whippe, nor rod, amendeth a loytering scholler, nor no example may reforme a filthie liuer. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> plague is past, the people fall to pleasure.

Yet my hope is (good Reader) that the wise will be warned, and the well disposed person will be the better, while he liueth, as oft as this late Earthquake shal come to his minde and memorie. For it was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelous in the sight of man, &amp; a great thing (no doubt) before the face of the Almightie: to whom be praise and glory for euer.</p>
