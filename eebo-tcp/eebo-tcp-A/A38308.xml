         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>ALthough many deſignes have been defeated, yet that of <hi>Ireland</hi> holds well.
And now our laſt plot workes as hopefully as that of <hi>Ireland,</hi> we muſt beare
with ſomething in the Man, his will is ſtrong enough, as long as he is fed with
hopes, the Woman is true to us, and reall, Her Councell about her is very good: I
doubt not but to ſend you by the next very joyfull newes, for the preſent, our rich
Enemies, <hi>Pym, Hampden, Stroude, Hollis,</hi> and <hi>Haſlerigg,</hi> are blemiſht, challenged for
no leſſe then Treaſon: before I write next we doubt not but to have them in the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
or their heads from their ſhoulders.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Solicitor,</hi> and <hi>Fynes,</hi> and <hi>Earle</hi> we muſt ſerve with the ſame ſauce: And in the
Houſe of the Lords, <hi>Mandevill</hi> is touched, but <hi>Eſſex, Warwick, Say, Brook,</hi> and <hi>Paget</hi>
muſt follow, or elſe we ſhall not be quiet. <hi>Faulkland</hi> and <hi>Culpepper,</hi> are friends to our
ſide, at leaſt wiſe they will doe us no hurt. The Proteſtants and Puritans are ſo divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that we need not feare them; the Proteſtants in a greater part will joyne with
us, or ſtand Neuters, while the Puritan is ſuppreſſed. If we can bring them under;
the Proteſtant will either fall in with us generally, or elſe, if they doe not, they are
ſo indifferent, that either by faire, or foule meanes, wee ſhall be able to command them.</p>
            <p>The miſchievous Londoners, and Apprentices, may doe us ſome hurt for preſent,
but wee need not much feare them; they doe nothing orderly, but tumultuouſly:
Therefore we doubt not but to have them under command after one brunt, for our
Party is ſtrong in the City, eſpecially <hi>Holborne,</hi> the new Buildings, and <hi>Weſtminſter:</hi>
We are afraid of nothing, but the <hi>Scots</hi> appearing againe: But we have made a Party
there, at the Kings laſt being there, which will hold their hands behinde them, while
we act our parts at home; Let us acquite our ſelves like men, for our Religion and
Countrey, now or never. The Kings heart is Proteſtant, but our friends can perſwade
Him, and make Him beleeve any thing. He hates the Puritane party, and is made ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcileable
to that ſide; ſo that the Sunne, the Moone, and Starres, are for us. There
are no leſſe then twenty thouſand Miniſters in <hi>England,</hi> the greater halfe will in their
places, be our friends, to avenge the Biſhops diſhonour. Let our friends be incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
the worke is more then halfe done.</p>
