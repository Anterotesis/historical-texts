            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>'TIS obvious, That the <hi>Popiſh Intereſt</hi> hath of late years regain'd much Ground, and is not a little <hi>enlarg'd</hi> and ſtrengthen'd in the World; as well by the Indefatigable Induſtry of their <hi>Prieſts and Jeſuits,</hi> the unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>feuds</hi> amongſt the <hi>Reform'd,</hi> and the unhappy <hi>Wars</hi> between Proteſtant <hi>Princes and States,</hi> as more eſpecially by the growing <hi>greatneſs</hi> of the <hi>French Monarch</hi> (who now at laſt would co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour his <hi>Inſatiate</hi> aims at <hi>Glory and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire</hi> by pretentions of propagating the <hi>Roman Religion;</hi> and hopes thereby not only to engage all the <hi>Pontificial Clergy</hi> in favour of his Deſigns, but
<pb facs="tcp:65919:3"/>
alſo to <hi>Atone</hi> for all the <hi>Blood</hi> and Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, wherin he hath involv'd <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom;</hi> If the extirpation of what they call <hi>HERESIE,</hi> may but be one of the Conſequents attending the Succeſs of his <hi>Arms</hi>) In particular, 'tis no leſs notorious, That theſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of Great <hi>Brittain and Ireland,</hi> labour at preſent under a <hi>Popiſh Conſpiracy,</hi> which by <hi>Supreme</hi> Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity has more than once (and ſure not inconſiderately, or in <hi>Jeſt</hi>) been declar'd <hi>HORRID</hi> and <hi>DAMNABLE;</hi> a main Branch and <hi>Maſter-wheel</hi> of which, has been ſufficiently prov'd to be a Deſign of <hi>dividing</hi> and embroiling us amongſt our ſelves.</p>
            <p>To effect which, obſerving that the Body of the people of <hi>England,</hi> though generally agreeing in all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary points of Chriſtian Doctrine; do yet conſiſt (in another reſpect) of two Sorts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thoſe that have a Veneration for the Eccleſiaſtical <hi>Rites</hi> and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies retain'd by our <hi>firſt Reformers,</hi> rather perhaps for prudential Reaſons
<pb facs="tcp:65919:3"/>
ſuitable to that Juncture, than for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Apprehenſions they had that the ſame were always obliging; as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles (in the <hi>firſt,</hi> and poſſibly <hi>only unerring Council</hi> that ever was held) thought fit to caution their <hi>new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts</hi> for avoiding of <hi>ſcandal</hi> to the Jews, and hindrance of propagating the Goſpel, to abſtain from <hi>Blood and things ſtrangled,</hi> which yet few Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians at this day, or for many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years paſt, have thought neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to obſerve.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thoſe that commending and bleſſing God for the happy Labours of thoſe our <hi>pious Anceſtours,</hi> who in their day went ſo far, do yet in this Age of Light (and when Compliances with Ceremonies, that may but ſeem ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious or unwarrantable, are neither advantageous nor <hi>Convenient</hi> for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing the great Ends of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but rather the contrary) decline to join therein, and cannot (as they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) with a ſafe Conſcience embrace them, eſpecially when impoſed as <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries</hi> to Church Communion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:65919:4"/>The crafty <hi>Romiſh</hi> Incendiaries hence take an opportunity to heat the one of theſe againſt the other, that with greater eaſe they may deſtroy them both. And ſo far prevail, That ſome <hi>Church-Men,</hi> inſtead of abating any thing do rather ſeek to ſcrew up their <hi>Ceremonies higher,</hi> and appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating to themſelves the Title of The <hi>Church of England,</hi> do not only exclude all others that cannot keep <hi>pace</hi> with them, though otherwiſe <hi>Orthodox</hi> in Faith, pious towards God, Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to the King, and peaceable with their Neighbours, but likewiſe <hi>Brand</hi> them with the odious Titles of <hi>Whigs, Fanaticks, Enemies to the Church,</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſloyal to His Majeſty, <hi>Diſturbers</hi> of the Government, Factious; and in a word, repreſent them in ſuch hideous Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, as if they were altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable, a People that ought to be utterly extirpated, as being <hi>no leſs Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite</hi> to our Religion, and as dangerous as <hi>Papiſts</hi> (even the worſt of them, the Juſuites) themſelves, and therefore do both ſeek to turn the edge of thoſe Penal Laws originally intended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb facs="tcp:65919:4"/>
               <hi>Popiſh</hi> Recuſants on theſe <hi>Non-Ceremony-Conforming</hi> Proteſtants, but alſo are not aſhamed to own they have more kindneſs for the <hi>former</hi> than the <hi>latter,</hi> and a greater averſion to <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi> than to <hi>Papiſts;</hi> or, if they do not ſay ſo in Words, yet the ſame is too apparent from their deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; For how many are there who call themſelves of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> That upon the Diſcovery of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Plot (though the KING and ſeveral Parliaments had declared it) were yet mighty <hi>unwilling</hi> to believe it, and <hi>ready</hi> to diſeſteem the Evidence, and <hi>excuſe</hi> the Perſons accuſed, or at leaſt to lay it only on the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> and ſhift off the Odium from the reſt of the Papiſts? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whereas on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>the very ſame Men</hi> on the firſt <hi>Buz</hi> of a Presbyterian Plot (though no ſuch thing has to this minute been <hi>prov'd,</hi> but on the contrary ſeveral wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Forgeries and <hi>Shammings</hi> of <hi>pretended Plots</hi> upon them, wonderfully detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) ſhew themſelves not only moſt ready and willing to credit it, and buſie to ſpread the Rumour, but tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
<pb facs="tcp:65919:5"/>
and are <hi>tickled</hi> with any Story, though never ſo falſe and fooliſh, that looks that way; and in their <hi>drunken Confuſions,</hi> and horrid <hi>Curſes,</hi> load all <hi>Diſſenters</hi> in general with the Guilt of this imaginary Conſpiracy.</p>
            <p>Now is it not plain to every Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate man, That all this tends to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than to embroil us in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable, implacable and endleſs Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities at <hi>Home,</hi> and diſ joint us from all affectionate Alliances with, and aſſiſtance towards the <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches <hi>abroad?</hi> They being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of the ſame <hi>Stamp,</hi> as to <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi> (the great matter in Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie) with our <hi>Diſſenters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What remains then in ſuch a Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, but that we ſhould truly inform our ſelves of the <hi>real differences</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Eſtabliſh'd Doctrines of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Opinions of theſe Proteſtant-Diſſenters, ſo much clamoured againſt, on the one ſide; and the Tenets of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> on the other; That ſo we may upon <hi>an Impartial Survey,</hi> judge which is moſt <hi>oppoſite</hi> and at greateſt diſtance,
<pb facs="tcp:65919:5"/>
and accordingly Treat them with more or leſs Condeſcention and Affection: And if upon a juſt ſcrutiny, we ſhall find, that there is none, or very little Eſſential difference between our Church, and thoſe called Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, or Calviniſts (either at home, or abroad) That then we may lay by our Fury and Rancour, and embrace one another as Brethren, and cordial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Join againſt the common Enemy.</p>
            <p>To facilitate this happy and deſired Union, if this ſmall Work may be of any uſe, I ſhall think my pains in collecting it, abundantly rewarded: However there were ſeveral Reaſons, which to me ſeem'd important, that ſwayed me thereunto. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. I had obſerv'd, That abundance of People, who account themſelves of, and talk loudeſt about the Church of <hi>England,</hi> never ſeriouſly peruſed, nay, have not ſo much as read or ſeen <hi>her Articles</hi> of Faith (publiſht by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority). Now I conceive it may be no unuſeful Service to ſuch Perſons, to recommend to them thoſe Articles, That no longer they may remain in
<pb facs="tcp:65919:6"/>
an <hi>Implicite Faith;</hi> but read, Conſider, and with underſtanding embrace what they before out of Compliance or <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> rather than <hi>Judgment,</hi> ſeem'd to own and adhere to.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There are many too, That <hi>in words</hi> deteſt <hi>Popery,</hi> yet not being throughly grounded in the Doctrines of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> may be in danger of miſtaking the one for the other, and by <hi>Jacob</hi>'s <hi>voice</hi> be deluded into <hi>Eſau</hi>'s <hi>hands,</hi> and imbibe Poiſon unawares, unleſſ forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied againſt it by ſome ſuch diſcrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Antitheſis.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Hereby will appear the malice and <hi>falſhood</hi> of theſe ſuggeſtions, That the Diſſenters ſtand at as great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from, and are as much oppoſite to the legally Eſtabliſhed Church of <hi>England,</hi> as the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> a miſchievous conceit promoted by the Jeſuites and other Factors for the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> on purpoſe to divide and <hi>weaken</hi> us, and conſequently thereby to accompliſh at laſt their own ends, which are utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſubvert and deſtroy all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
<pb facs="tcp:65919:6"/>
of the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Epiſcopal, Presbyterial, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what ever other Denomination.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I know not what could better tend to uniting us (at leaſt in affection) amongſt our ſelves, than this demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, That <hi>in the main</hi> and all eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Doctrinal points, <hi>we are already a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed,</hi> and ſince the other matters in Controverſie are acknowledged to be <hi>indifferent,</hi> what occaſion is there for all this heat and violence, unleſs the <hi>leſſer</hi> our differences are, the <hi>greater</hi> ſtill muſt be our Animoſities and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions about them?</p>
            <p n="5">5. I do not deſpair but this ſmall Treatiſe may be profitable to weak Capacities for inſtructing them in <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals</hi> of Chriſtian Religion, ſince it contains a <hi>general Syſteme</hi> of Faith, rendered the more intelligible, by the variety of Expreſſions, though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current Senſe, of the Church-men and Proteſtant-Diſſenters on the one ſide, and the apparent Contradictions of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> on the other, For <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria juxta ſe poſita magis Eluceſcunt,</hi> contraries aptly compared, illuſtrate each other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:65919:7"/>Thus much for the <hi>End</hi> and general Intention of this Work—As to the <hi>manner</hi> how it is perform'd, I could indeed have wiſht it might have come from ſome <hi>abler</hi> Hand, whoſe <hi>Skill</hi> might have rendered it more uſeful, and his <hi>Name</hi> more acceptable to the publick. But rather a <hi>Mite</hi> than no Offering at all for the Churches <hi>Peace,</hi> I have done what my ſmall Reading and interrupted Leiſure would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and need only Advertiſe the Reader, that here he ſhall find,</p>

Indeed there hath been great Diverſity of Opinions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Men, both Good and Learned, about it: Many there are, that by Hell here underſtand the Grave; and I think none will deny but the Word is capable of ſuch a Senſe; but then the Senſe muſt run thus—He was Crucified, Dead and Buried, and Deſcended into the Grave, which is a vain Repetition; for if he were <hi>Buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> he muſt be in a <hi>Grave:</hi> And ſuch a Tautology is not to be ſuppoſed in ſo brief a Summary of Faith. But in my private Thoughts I have happen'd upon a Notion which avoids that Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity, and that is this—When our Bleſſed Lord was Crucified, and Dead, and his Body Buried, his <hi>Humane Soul</hi> return'd to God, (in which Senſe he ſaith to the Thief, <hi>This day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe</hi>) and afterwards,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65919:17"/>
when it came to re-enliven, and be united to the Body in the <hi>Grave,</hi> at his Reſurrection, why may not that be the <hi>Deſcent</hi> here intended?

Nor do I perceive that this Interpretation (how <hi>new</hi> ſoever it may ſeem) does in any kind Contradict the Analogy of Faith.

and into what Abſurdities they run, that without Scripture will with ſhew of good Intention, advance their own Conceits.

               <p>PRedeſtination to Life, is the everlaſting purpoſe of God, whereby (before the Foundations of the World

               <p>As the Godly Conſideration of Predeſtination &amp; our Election in Chriſt is full of ſweet, pleaſant, &amp; unſpeakable comfort to Godly Perſons, &amp; ſuch as feel in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the working of the Spirit

of Chriſt, mortifying the works of the Fleſh and their Earthly Members, and drawing up their minds to high and heavenly things, as well becauſe it doth greatly eſtabliſh and confirm their Faith of Eternal Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be enjoyed through Chriſt, as becauſe it doth frequently kindle their love towards God; ſo for curious and carnal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, lacking the Spirit of Chriſt, to have continually before their Eyes the Sentence of Gods Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, is a moſt dangerous downfal, whereby the Devil doth thruſt them into Deſperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or into Wretchleſneſs of moſt unclean living, no leſs pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous than Deſperation.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, we muſt receive Gods Promiſes in ſuch wiſe as they be generally ſet forth in Holy Scripture: and in our doings, that Will of God is to be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which we have expreſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared unto us in the Word of God.</p>

                  <p>The name of God only is that by which Men ought to ſwear, and therein is to be uſed with all Holy Fear and Reverence.
