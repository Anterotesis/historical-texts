            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Know very well what a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage
it is for Me, to maintaine
an Argument of Divinity with ſo
able and learned a Man as your ſelf,
it being your, not My profeſſion; which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
was the cauſe that made Me deſire to
heare ſome learned man argue My Opinion
with you, of whoſe abilities I might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident,
that I ſhould not be led into an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
for want of having all which could be
ſaid, layed open unto Me: For indeed, My
humour is ſuch, that I am ſtill partiall for that
ſide, which I imagine ſuffers for the weakneſſe
of thoſe that maintaine it; alwaies thinking
that equall Champions would caſt the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
on the other part; Yet ſince that you
(thinking that it will ſave time) deſire to goe
another way, I ſhall not conteſt with you in
it, but treating you as My Phyſitian, give you
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:153109:4"/>
leave to take your owne way of cure; onely I
thought fit to warne you, leſt if you, (not I)
ſhould be miſtaken in this, you would be faine
(in a manner) to begin anew.</p>
               <p>Then know that from my Infancy I was
bleſt with the King my Fathers love, which,
I thanke God, was an unvaluable happineſſe
to me, all his daies, and among all his cares
for my education, his chief was, to ſettle me
right in Religion; in the true Knowledge of
which, he made himſelf ſo eminent to all the
World, that, I am ſure, none can call in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
the brightneſſe of his Fame in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
without ſhewing their own ignorant baſe
malice: He it was, who laid in Me the Grounds
of Chriſtianity, which to this day I have been
conſtant in; ſo that whether the worthineſſe
of My Inſtructor be conſidered, or the not
few yeares that I have been ſetled in My Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;
it ought to be no ſtrange thing, if it be
found no eaſie worke, to make me alter them:
and the rather, that hitherto, I have (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Saint <hi>Paul's</hi> rule, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 22.) been
happy in <hi>Not condemning my ſelfe, in that
thing which I allow:</hi> Thus having ſhewed you
how, it remaines, to tell you what, I believe,
in relation to theſe preſent miſerable diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
               <p>No one thing made Me more reverence the
Reformation of My Mother, the Church of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:153109:4"/>
                  <hi>England,</hi> than that it was done (according to
the <hi>Apostles</hi> defence, <hi>Act.</hi> 24. 18.) <hi>neither with
multitude, nor with tumult,</hi> but legally and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly;
and by thoſe, whom I conceive to have
onely the reforming power; which with many
other inducements, made Me alwayes confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that the worke was very perfect, as to
Eſſentials; of which number Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
being undoubtedly one, I put no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
but that would have been likewiſe alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
if there had been cauſe; which opinion
of mine, was ſoone turned into more than a
confidence, when I perceived that in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
(as I muſt ſay of all the reſt) we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
nothing but according as it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
from the Apoſtles to be the conſtant
univerſall cuſtome of the Primitive Church;
and that it was of ſuch conſequence, as by the
alteration of it, we ſhould deprive our ſelves
of a lawfull Prieſthood, and then, how the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
can be duly Adminiſtred, is eaſie to
judge: Theſe are the principall Reaſons, which
make me believe that Biſhops are neceſſary for
a Church, and, I think, ſufficient for Me (if I
had no more) not to give My conſent for their
expulſion out of <hi>England;</hi> but I have another
obligation, that to my particular, is a no leſſe
tie of Conſcience, which is, My <hi>Coronation
Oath:</hi> Now if (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 23.)

warrant there is in the Word of God, for Subjects
to endeavour to force their Kings Conſcience?
or to make him alter Lawes againſt his will?</hi> If
this be not my preſent caſe, I ſhall be glad to

hath been miſled all this time, I ſhall be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p n="1">1. IT is Your Majeſties royall goodneſs, and not
my merit, that hath made your Majeſty to
conceive any opinion of my abilities; which
(were they worthy of the ſmallest teſtimony from
your Majeſty) ought in all duty to be improved
for your Majeſties ſatisfaction. And this I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
in my coming here at this time, by a free,
yet modeſt expreſsion of the true motives and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements
which drew my mind to the diſlike of
Epiſcopall Government, wherein I was bred in
my younger years at the Univerſity. Like as I did
apprehend that it was not your Majeſties purpoſe
to have the Queſtion diſputed by Divines on both
ſides; which I would never (to the wronging of
the cauſe) have undertaken alone; and which ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
or never hath proved an effectuall way, for
finding of truth, or moving the minds of Men to
relinquiſh their former Tenents, <hi>Dum res tranſit
à judicio in affectum;</hi> witneſs the Polemicks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Papiſts and us, and among our ſelves,
about the matter now in hand, theſe many yeares
paſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sir, when I conſider your Majesties education
under the hands of ſuch a Father, the length of
time wherein Your Majeſty hath been ſetled in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:153109:7"/>
your principles of Church-Government; the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
which have continually in private and
publique, eſpecially of late at <hi>Oxford,</hi> filled your
Majeſties eares for the Divine Right thereof;
your Coronation Oath; and divers State-reaſons
which your Majeſty doth not mention: I doe not
wonder, nor think it any ſtrange thing, that your
Majesty hath not at firſt given place to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
impreſsion. I remember that the famous
<hi>Joannes Picus Mirandula</hi> proveth by irrefra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable
Reaſons (which no rationall man will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict)
<hi>That no man hath ſo much power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
his own underſtanding, as to make himſelf
believe what he will, or to think that to be true
which his reaſon telleth him is falſe; much
leſſe is it poſſible for any man to have his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
commanded by the will, or at the pleaſure
of another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a true ſaying of the School-men, <hi>Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas
imperat intellectui quoad exercitium, non
quoad ſpecificationem,</hi> Mine owne will, or the
will of another may command me to thinke upon
a matter; but no will or command can conſtraine
me to determine otherwiſe then my reaſon tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth

acknowledge, (for your Paper profeſſeth no leſſe)
that according to the ſaying of <hi>Ambroſe, Non

nor ſhame to change to the better: <hi>Symmachus</hi>

time, from worldly proſperity, and the flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
condition of the Roman Empire, and from
the Lawes of the Land, to perſwade them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
in the ancient Pagan profeſsion of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
againſt the imbracing of the Chriſtian
Faith. The like reaſons were uſed by the Jewes
for <hi>Moſes</hi> againſt <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and may be uſed both
for Popery and for the Papacy it ſelfe, againſt
the reformation of Religion &amp; Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and therefore can have no more ſtrength
againſt the Change now, than they had in former
times.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But your Majeſty may perhaps ſay, That this
is <hi>petitio principii,</hi> and nothing elſe but the
begging of the Queſtion; and I confeſſe it were
ſo, if there can be no Reaſons brought for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
or Change; Your Majeſty reverences
the Reformation of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as
being done legally and orderly, and by thoſe who
had the Reforming Power: and I doe not deny,
but it were to be wiſht, that Religion where there
is need, were alwaies Reformed in that manner,
and by ſuch power, and that it were not commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Prelats, who have greateſt need to be
reformed themſelves, not left to the multitude,
whom God ſtirreth up when Princes are negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent:
Thus did <hi>Jacob</hi> reforme his owne Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>Moſes</hi> destroyed the golden Calfe, the good
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:153109:8"/>
Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> reformed the Church in their
time: but that ſuch Reformation hath been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
I cannot admit. <hi>Aſa</hi> tooke away Idolatry,
but his Reformation was not perfect; for <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaphat</hi>
removed the high Places, yet was not his
Reformation perfect, for it was <hi>Hezekiah</hi> that
brake the braſen Serpent, and <hi>Joſiah</hi> deſtroyed
the Idol-Temples, who therefore beareth this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie,
<hi>That like unto him there was no King
before him.</hi> It is too well knowne that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of K. <hi>Henry</hi> 8. was moſt imperfect in
the Eſſentials of Doctrine, Worſhip, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
And although it proceeded by ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
afterward, yet the Government was never
reformed, the head was changed, <hi>Dominus non
Dominium;</hi> and the whole limbs of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
Hierarchy retained, upon what ſnares
and temptations of Avarice and Ambition, the
great Enchanters of the Clergy, I need not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe.
It was a hard ſaying of <hi>Romanorum
Malleus Groſted of Lincolne,</hi> That Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was not to be expected, <hi>niſi in ore gladii cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entandi:</hi>
yet this I may ſay, that the Laodicean
lukewarmneſſe of Reformation here, hath been
matter of continued complaints to many of the
Godly in this Kingdom; occaſion of more ſchiſme
and ſeparation then ever was heard of in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Church; and of unſpeakable griefe and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
to other Churches, which God did bleſſe with
greater purity of Reformation. The glory of this
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:153109:8"/>
great worke we hope is reſerved for your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
that to your comfort and everlaſting fame
the praiſe of godly <hi>Joſiah</hi> may be made yours;
which yet will be no diſpraiſe to your royall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or <hi>Edward</hi> 6. or any other religious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
before you; none of them having ſo faire an
opportunity as is now by the ſupreme providence
put into your Royall hands. My ſoule trembleth
to think and to foreſee, what may be the event,
if this opportunity be neglected. I will neither
uſe the words of <hi>Mordecay, Eſth.</hi> 4. 14. nor what
<hi>Savanarola</hi> told another <hi>Charles,</hi> becauſe I hope
better things from your Majeſty.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To the Argument brought by your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
(which I believe none of your Doctors, had
they been all about you, could more briefly and
yet ſo fully and ſtrongly have expreſſed) [<hi>That
nothing was retained in this Church but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as it was deduced from the Apoſtles
to the conſtant univerſall practiſe of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Church; and that it was of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
as by the alteration of it, We ſhould
deprive our ſelves of the lawfulneſſe of Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi>
(I thinke your Majeſty meanes a lawfull
Miniſtry) <hi>and then how the Sacraments can be
adminiſtred, is eaſie to judge.</hi>] I humbly offer
theſe conſiderations: Firſt, what was not in the
times of the Apoſtles, cannot be deduced from
them: We ſay in <hi>Scotland,</hi> It cannot be brought
But, that is not the Ben; but (not to inſiſt now in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:153109:9"/>
a Litourgy, and things of that kind) there was
no ſuch Hierarchy, no ſuch difference betwixt a
Biſhop and a Presbyter, in the times of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
and therefore it cannot thence be dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced;
for I conceive it to be as cleare as if it were
written with a Sun-beame, that Presbyter and
Biſhop are to the Apostles one and the ſame
thing, no majority, no inequality or difference of
office, power, or degree betwixt the one and the
other, but a meer identity in all. 2. That the
Apoſtles intending to ſet downe the Offices and
Officers of the Church, and ſpeaking ſo often of
them, and of their gifts and duties, and that, not
upon occaſion, but of ſet purpoſe; doe neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
nor imply any ſuch Paſtor or Biſhop as hath
power over other Pastors, although it be true,
that they have diſtinctly and particularly expreſt
the office, gifts, and duties of the meaneſt Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
ſuch as Deacons. 3. That in the Miniſtery
of the New Teſtament there is a comely, beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and divine order and ſubordination; one
kind of Miniſters both ordinary and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
being placed in degree and dignity one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
another, as the Apoſtles firſt, the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts,
Paſtors, Doctors, &amp;c. in their owne ranks:
bnt we cannot find in Offices of the ſame kind,
that one hath majority of power, or priority of
degree before another; no Apostle above other
Apostles (unleſſe in morall reſpects) no Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt
above other Evangelists; of Deacon above
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:153109:9"/>
other Deacons; why then a Paſtor above other
Paſtors? In all other ſorts of Miniſters ordinary
and extraordinary a parity in their owne kind,
only in the office of Paſtor an inequality. 4. That
the whole power and all the parts of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
which are commonly called, <hi>The power of
Order and Juriſdiction,</hi> are by the Apoſtles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to be common to the Presbyter and Biſhop:
And that, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 16, 17. the gradation in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Diſcipline or Church cenſures, is from one,
to two, or more; and if he ſhall neglect them,
tell it to the Church; he ſaith not, tell it to the
Biſhop: there is no place left to a retrogradation
from more to one, were he never ſo eminent. If
theſe conſiderations doe not ſatisfie, your Majeſty
may have more, or the ſame further cleared.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Secondly, I doe humbly deſire Your Majesty
to take notice of the fallacy of that Argument,
from the practice of the Primitive Church, and
the univerſall Conſent of the Fathers. It is the
Argument of the Papiſts for ſuch traditions as
no Orthodox Divine will admit. The Law and
Teſtimony muſt be the Rule. We can have no
certaine knowledge of the practice univerſall of
the Church for many years; <hi>Euſebius</hi> the prime
Hiſtorian confeſſeth ſo much: the learned <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus
Scaliger</hi> teſtifieth, That from the end of the
<hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> untill a good time after, no
certainty can be had from Eccleſiaſticall Authors
about Church matters. It is true, <hi>Diotrephes</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:153109:10"/>
ſought the preheminence in the Apoſtles times,
and the myſtery of iniquity did then begin to
work; and no doubt in after-times ſome puffed up
with Ambition, and others overtaken with weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
endevoured alteration of Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but that all the learned and godly of thoſe
times conſented to ſuch a change as is talked of
afterwards, will never be proved.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Thirdly, I will never think that Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
will deny the lawfulneſſe of a Miniſtery, and
the due adminiſtration of the Sacraments in the
Reformed Churches, which have no Dioceſan Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
ſith it is not only manifeſt by Scripture,
but a great many of the ſtrongeſt Champions for
Epiſcopacy, doe confeſſe, that Presbyters may or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
other Presbyters; and that Baptiſme ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred
by a private Perſon, wanting a publick
Calling, or by a Midwife, and by a Presbyter, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
not ordained by a Biſhop, are not one and
the ſame thing.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Concerning the other Argument taken from
Your Majesties Coronation Oath; I confeſſe, that
both in the taking and keeping of an Oath (ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
a thing is it, and ſo high a point of Religion)
much tenderneſſe is required: and farre be it
from us, who deſire to obſerve our owne Solemne
Oath, to preſſe Your Majeſty with the violation
of Yours. Yet Sir, I will crave your leave, in all
humbleneſſe and ſincerity to lay before Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
eyes this one thing, (which perhaps might
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:153109:10"/>
require a larger diſcourſe) that although no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
authority can diſpenſe with an Oath, <hi>Quia
Religio juramenti pertinet ad forum Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num;</hi>
yet in ſome caſes it cannot be denied but
the obligation of an Oath ceaſeth: As when we
ſwear homage and obedience to our Lord and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour,
who afterwards ceaſeth to be our Lord
and Superiour; for then the formall cauſe of the
Oath is taken away, and therefore the obligation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <hi>Sublata cauſa tollitur effectus; ſublato relato,
tollitur Correlatum.</hi> Or when any Oath hath
a ſpeciall reference to the benefit of thoſe to whom
I make the promiſe, if we have their deſire or
conſent, the obligation ceaſeth; becauſe all ſuch
Oaths from the nature of the thing, doe include
a condition. When the Parliaments of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
have covenanted for the aboliſhing or
altering of a Law, Your Majeſties Oath doth not
binde You, or Your Conſcience to the obſerving of
it; otherwiſe no Lawes could be altered by the
Legiſlative Power. This I conceive hath been
the ground of removing Epiſcopall Government
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and of removing the Biſhops out of
the Parliament of <hi>England.</hi> And I aſſure my
ſelfe, that Your Majeſty did not intend at the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of Your Oath, that although both Houſes of
Parliament ſhould find an alteration neceſſary,
although (which God Almighty avert) you ſhould
loſe your ſelfe, and your Poſterity, and Crowne,
that you would never conſent to the aboliſhing of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:153109:11"/>
ſuch a Law. If Your Majeſty ſtill object, <hi>that the
matter of the Oath is neceſſary &amp; immutable;</hi>
that doth not belong to this, but to the former Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
               <p n="8">8. I have but one word more concerning Your
Piety to Your Royall Father, and teacher of happy
Memory, with which Your Majeſty does conclude.
Your Majesty knows that King <hi>James</hi> never ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> upon Divine Right; That
His Majeſty did ſweare and ſubſcribe to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
Worſhip, and Diſcipline of the Church of
<hi>Scotland;</hi> that in the Preface of the latter Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Baſilicon Doron,</hi> His Majeſty gives an
honourable teſtimony to thoſe that loved better
the ſimplicity of the Goſpel, than the pomp and
Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and that
he conceived the Prelats to ſavour of the Popiſh
Hierarchy, and that (could his Ghoſt now ſpeake
to your Majeſty) He would not adviſe your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
to run ſuch hazards for thoſe Men who will
chuſe rather to pull downe your Throne with their
own ruine, than that they periſh alone. The Lord
give your Majeſty a wiſe and diſcerning Spirit to
chuſe that in time which is right.</p>

               <p>IF it had been the Honour of the Cauſe
which I looked after, I would not have
undertaken to put Pen to Paper, or ſingly
to have maintained this Argument againſt you
(whoſe Anſwer to my former Paper is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
without other proofs, to juſtifie My opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of your abilities) but, it being meerly (as
you know) for my particular ſatisfaction, I
aſſure you that a Diſputation of well choſen
Divines, would be moſt effectuall; and, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
you cannot but grant, that I muſt beſt
know, how my ſelf may be beſt ſatisfied, for
certainly My Taſte cannot be guided by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Mans Palate, and indeed I will ſay, that
when it comes (as it muſt) to Probations, I
muſt have either <hi>Perſons</hi> or <hi>Books</hi> to cleare the
Allegations, or it will be impoſſible to give Me
ſatisfaction: The fore-ſeeing of which, made
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:153109:12"/>
Me at firſt (for the ſaving of Time) deſire that
ſome of thoſe Divines, which I gave you in a
Liſt, might be ſent for.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Concerning your ſecond Section, I were
much too blame, if I ſhould not ſubmit to that
ſaying of S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> which you mention, for
I would be unwilling to be found leſſe ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
than you ſhew your ſelfe to be in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
part of it; wherefore my Reply is, that as
I ſhall not be aſhamed <hi>to change for the better,</hi>
ſo I muſt ſee that it is <hi>better</hi> before I <hi>change,</hi>
otherwiſe inconſtancy in this were both ſin and
ſhame; and remember (what your ſelfe hath
learnedly enforced) that <hi>no mans Reaſon can be
commanded by another mans Will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Your third begins, but I cannot ſay that it
goes on, with that Ingenuity, which the other
did; for I doe not underſtand, how thoſe <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples</hi>
cited out of the Old Teſtament do any
way prove that the way of <hi>Reformation,</hi> which
I commend, hath not been the moſt perfect,
or, that any other is lawfull, thoſe having been
all by the <hi>Regall Authority;</hi> and becauſe
<hi>Henry the Eights Reformation</hi> was not perfect,
will it prove that of K. <hi>Edward</hi> and Q. <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>
to be unperfect? I believe a new <hi>moode</hi>
and <hi>figure</hi> muſt be found out to forme a <hi>Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme,</hi>
whereby to prove that: but however,
you are miſtaken; for, no man who truely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands
the <hi>Engliſh Reformation,</hi> will derive
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:153109:12"/>
it from <hi>Henry the Eight,</hi> for he onely gave the
occaſion; it was his <hi>Sonne</hi> who began, and
Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> that perfected it; nor did I ever
averre, that the beginning of any Humane A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
was perfect, no more then you can prove
that <hi>God hath ever given approbation to Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
to Reforme the Negligence of Princes:</hi>
For, you know, there is much Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Permiſsion,</hi> and <hi>Approbation:</hi> But all
this time, I find no <hi>Reaſons</hi> (according to your
promiſe) for a <hi>Reformation,</hi> or <hi>change</hi> (I mean
ſince Q. <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time.) As for your <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum
Malleus</hi> his ſaying; it is well you come
of it, with [<hi>yet this I may ſay</hi>] for it ſeems to
imply, as if you neither ought nor would juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
that <hi>bloudy ungodly ſaying:</hi> and for your
comparing our <hi>Reformation</hi> here to the <hi>Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean
lukewarmneſſe,</hi> proved by <hi>Complaints,
Grievings, &amp;c.</hi> all that doth, and but unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely,
<hi>Petere principium;</hi> nor can Generalls
ſatisfie Me; for, you muſt firſt prove, that
thoſe Men had reaſon to complaine, thoſe
Churches to be Grieved, and how we were
truely the Cauſers of this ſchiſme and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
as for thoſe words which you will not
uſe, I will not anſwer.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Here indeed you truly repeat the firſt of
My two maine Arguments; but by your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
you take (as I conceive) a wrong way to
convince Me; It is I muſt make good the <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative,</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:153109:13"/>
for I believe a <hi>Negative</hi> cannot be
proved; Inſtead of which, if you had made
appear the <hi>practice</hi> of the <hi>Presbyterian Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
in the <hi>Primitive times,</hi> you had done
much; for I doe averre, that this <hi>Government</hi>
was never Practiſed before <hi>Calvin's time;</hi> the
<hi>affirmative</hi> of which, I leave you to prove;
My taske, being to ſhew the <hi>lawfulneſſe,</hi> and
<hi>ſucceſsion of Epiſcopacy,</hi> and, as I believe, the
<hi>neceſsity</hi> of it: For doing whereof, I muſt have
ſuch Books as I ſhall call for; which poſſibly
upon peruſall, may, one way or other, give Me
ſatisfaction; but I cannot abſolutely promiſe
it without the aſſiſtance of ſome learned Man,
whom I can truſt, to find out all ſuch Citati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as I have uſe of: wherefore blame Me
not, if time be unneceſſarily loſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Now for the <hi>fallaciouſneſſe</hi> of My <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
(to my knowledge) it was never My <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,</hi>
nor doe I confeſſe to have begun now;
For, if the <hi>Practice</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi>
and the <hi>univerſal conſent of the Fathers,</hi> be not
a convincing Argument, when the <hi>interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of <hi>Scripture</hi> is doubtfull, I know nothing;
For, if this be not, then of <hi>neceſsity</hi> the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of private Spirits</hi> muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted:
the which contradicts Saint <hi>Peter,</hi>
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 20. is the <hi>Mother</hi> of all <hi>Sects,</hi> and
will (if not prevented) bring theſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
into confuſion: and to ſay, that an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:153109:13"/>
is ill, becauſe the <hi>Papists</hi> uſe it, or, that
ſuch a thing is good, becauſe it is the Cuſtome
of <hi>ſome</hi> of the <hi>Reformed Churches;</hi> cannot
weigh with Me, untill you prove, theſe to be
<hi>infallible,</hi> or that to maintaine <hi>no Truth:</hi> And
how <hi>Diotrephes</hi> ambition (who directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> S. <hi>John</hi>) can be an Argument
againſt <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> I doe not underſtand.</p>
               <p n="6">6. When I am made a <hi>Judge</hi> over the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches,</hi> then, and not before, will I
cenſure their <hi>Actions;</hi> as you muſt prove, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I confeſſe it, that <hi>Presbyters without a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
may lawfully ordain other Presbyters:</hi> And
as for the Adminiſtration of <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> as I
thinke none will ſay, that a Woman can law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
or Duely adminiſter it, though when
done, it be <hi>valid;</hi> ſo none ought to doe it, but
a lawfull <hi>Presbyter,</hi> whom you cannot deny,
but to be abſolutely neceſſary for the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. You make a learned ſuccinct diſcourſe
of <hi>Oathes</hi> in generall, and their ſeverall <hi>Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
to which I fully agree; intending, in the
particular now in queſtion, to be guided by
your owne <hi>Rule,</hi> which is [<hi>when any Oath hath
a ſpeciall reference to the Benefit of thoſe to whom
I make the Promiſe, if we have their deſire, or
conſent, the Obligation ceaſeth</hi>] Now, it muſt be
known, <hi>to whom</hi> this Oath hath reference, and
to <hi>whoſe Benefit?</hi> the Anſwer is cleare, onely
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:153109:14"/>
to the <hi>Church of England;</hi> as by the <hi>Record</hi> will
be plainly made appeare; and you much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
in alleaging, that the two <hi>Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>
(eſpecially as they are now conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
can have this <hi>Diſobligatory Power,</hi> for,
(beſides that they are not named in it) I am
confident to make it clearly appeare to you,
that this <hi>Church</hi> never did ſubmit, nor was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
to them; and that it was onely the
<hi>King and Clergy,</hi> who made the <hi>Reformation,</hi>
the <hi>Parliament</hi> meerly ſerving to help to give
the <hi>Civill Sanction:</hi> all this being proved (of
which I make no queſtion) it muſt neceſſarily
follow, that it is onely the <hi>Church of England</hi>
(in whoſe favour I took this Oath) that can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe
me from it: wherefore when the <hi>Church
of England</hi> (being lawfully Aſſembled) ſhall
declare that I am free, then, and not before, I
ſhall eſteem My ſelf ſo.</p>
               <p n="8">8. To your laſt, concerning the <hi>King my
Father,</hi> of happy and famous Memory, both
for his <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Learning;</hi> I muſt tell you,

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>THe ſmaller the encouragements be, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to the ſucceſſe, (which how ſmall
they are, your Majeſty well knowes:) the
more apparent, and, I hope, the more acceptable
will my obedience be, in that which in all humility
I now go about, at your Majesties command: yet
while I conſider, that the way of man is not in
himſelfe, nor is it in man that walketh, to direct
his owne ſteps; and when I remember how many
ſupplications, with ſtrong crying and tears, have
been openly and in ſecret offered up in your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
behalfe, unto God that heareth prayer, I
have no reaſon to deſpaire of a bleſſed ſucceſſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I have been averſe, from a diſputation of
Divines, 1. For ſaving of time; which the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
exigence &amp; extremity of affairs, make more
then ordinarily pretious; While <hi>Archimedes</hi> at
<hi>Syracuſe</hi> was drawing his figures &amp; circlings in
the ſand, <hi>Marcellus</hi> interupted his demonſtration.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:153109:15"/>
2. Becauſe the common reſult of Diſputes of this
kind, anſwerable to the prejudicate opinions of
the Parties, is rather Victory then Verity; while
<hi>tanquam tentativi Dialectici,</hi> they ſtudy more to
overcome their adverſe Party, than to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of Truth, although this be the moſt glorious
Victory. 3. When I was commanded to come
hither, no ſuch thing was propoſed to me, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
by me. I never judged ſo meanly of the
Cauſe, nor ſo highly of my ſelfe, as to venture it
upon ſuch weakneſſe. Much more might be ſpoken
to this purpoſe; but I forbeare.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I will not further trouble your Majeſty with
that which is contained in the ſecond Section,
hoping that your Majeſty will no more inſiſt upon
<hi>Education, preſcription of time, &amp;c.</hi> which
are ſufficient to prevent Admiration, but (which
your Majeſty acknowledges) muſt give place to
Reaſon, and are no ſure ground of reſolution of
our Faith, in any point to be believed: although
it be true that the most part of men make theſe
and the like, to be the ground and rule of their
Faith: an Evidence, that their Faith is not a
Divine faith, but an humane Credulity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Concerning <hi>Reformation of Religion</hi> in
the third Section; I had need of a Preface to ſo
thorny a Theame, as your Majeſty hath brought
me upon; 1. For <hi>the Reforming power;</hi> it is
conceived, when a Generall Defection, like a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge,
hath covered the whole face of the Church,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:153109:16"/>
ſo that ſcarcely the tops of the Mountains doe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
a Generall Councell is neceſſary; but, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that can hardly be obtained, ſeverall King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
(which we ſee was done, at the time of the
Reformation) are to reforme themſelves, and
that by the Authority of their Prince, and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates:
if the Prince or ſupreme Magistrate,
be unwilling, then may the inferior Magiſtrate,
and the People, being before rightly, informed in
the grounds of Religion, lawfully Reforme, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their owne ſphere; and if the light ſhine upon
all, or the major part, they may, after all other
meanes aſſayed, make a Publique Reformation.
This, before this time, I never wrote or ſpoke; yet
the Maintainers of this Doctrine, conceive that
they are able to make it good. But, <hi>Sir,</hi> were I
worthy to give advice to your Majesty, or to the
Kings and ſupreme Powers on Earth, my humble
Opinion would be, that they ſhould draw the
minds, tongues, and pens of the learned, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
about other matter, then the power or Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
of Kings and Princes; and in this kind,
your Majeſty hath ſuffered and loſt more, then will
eaſily be reſtored to your ſelfe or your Poſterity,
for a long time. It is not denied but the prime
Reforming power, is in Kings and Princes, <hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus—deficientibus,</hi>
it comes to the inferior Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate,
<hi>Quibus Deficientibus,</hi> it deſcendeth to
the Body of the People; ſuppoſing that there is a
neceſsity of Reformation, and that by no meanes it
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:153109:16"/>
can be obtained of their Superiors. It is true that
ſuch a Reformation, is more imperfect, in reſpect
of the Inſtruments, and manner of Procedure; yet
for the moſt part, more pure and perfect in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the effect and product. And for this end
did I cite the Examples of old of Reformation by
Regall Authority; of which none was perfect, in
the ſecond way of perfection, except that of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah.</hi>
Concerning the ſaying of <hi>Groſtead,</hi> whom
the <hi>Cardinals at Rome</hi> confeſt to be a more
Godly man, than any of themſelves; it was his
Complaint, and Prediction of what was likely to
enſue, not his deſire, or Election, if Reformation
could have been obtained, in the ordinary way. I
might bring two unpartiall Witneſſes, <hi>Jewel</hi> and
<hi>Bilſon,</hi> both famous Engliſh Biſhops, to prove
that the tumults and troubles raiſed in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
at the time of Reformation, were to be imputed to
the Papists oppoſing of the Reformation, both of
Doctrine and Diſcipline, as an Hereticall Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
and not to be aſcribed to the Nobility, or
People, who under God, were the Instruments of
it; intending and ſeeking nothing, but the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
out of Errour, and ſetling of the Truth.
2. Concerning the Reformation of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> I conceive, whether it was begun or
not, in K. <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. time, it was not finiſhed
by Q. <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> the Father ſtirred the humors
of the diſeaſed Church; but neither the Sonne
nor the Daughter (although we have great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:153109:17"/>
to bleſſe God for both) did purge them out per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly:
This Perfection is yet reſerved for your
Majeſty: Where it is ſaid, <hi>that all this time I
bring no Reaſons, for a further Change;</hi> the
fourth Section, of my laſt Paper, hath many hints
of <hi>Reaſons againſt Epiſcopall Government,</hi>
with an offer of more, or clearing of thoſe; which
your Majesty hath not thought fit to take notice
of. And learned men, have obſerved many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
in that Reformation: As that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> (for about this
is the Queſtion now) is not builded upon the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> which they,
at least cannot deny, who profeſſe <hi>Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>
to be <hi>mutable</hi> and <hi>ambulatory;</hi> and
ſuch were the greater part of <hi>Arch-biſhops</hi> and
<hi>Biſhops</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> contenting themſelves with
the <hi>conſtitutions</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
and <hi>munificence</hi> of <hi>Princes,</hi> till of late, that
ſome few have pleaded it to be <hi>Jure Divino:
That, the Engliſh Reformation hath not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
purged out the Roman Leven;</hi> which is
one of the <hi>reaſons</hi> that have given ground to the
comparing of this Church to the Church of <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaea,</hi>
as being neither hot nor cold, neither <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh</hi>
nor <hi>Reformed,</hi> but of a lukewarme temper,
betwixt the two: <hi>That it hath depraved the
Diſcipline of the Church, by conforming of it
to the Civil policy: That it hath added many
Church Offices, higher &amp; lower, unto thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:153109:17"/>
by the Son of God;</hi> which is as unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
as to take away Offices warranted by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Inſtitution: and other the like, which have
moved ſome to apply this ſaying to the Church of
<hi>England, Multi ad perfectionem pervenirent,
niſi jam ſe perveniſſe crederent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. In my Anſwer to the firſt of your Majeſties
many Arguments, I brought a Breviate of ſome
Reaſons to prove, <hi>that a Biſhop and Presbyter
are one and the ſame in Scripture:</hi> from which,
by neceſſary conſequence, I did inferre the <hi>nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;
Therefore,</hi> no difference in Scripture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
a <hi>Biſhop</hi> and a <hi>Presbyter;</hi> the one name
ſignifying, <hi>Induſtriam Curiae Paſtoralis;</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Sapientiae Maturitatem,</hi> ſaith <hi>Beda.</hi> And
whereas Your Majeſty averres, <hi>that Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
Government was never practiſed, before
Calvin's time;</hi> your Majesty knows, the common
objection of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> againſt the <hi>Reformed
Churches;</hi> Where was your Church, your Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
your Doctrine, before <hi>Luther's</hi> time?
One part of the common Anſwer is, <hi>that it was
from the beginning, and is to be found in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture:</hi>
The ſame I affirme of Presbyterian Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment:
And for proving of this, the <hi>Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of Divines</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> have made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt,
<hi>that the Primitive Chriſtian Church
at</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>was governed by a Presbytery:</hi>
while they ſhew, 1. That that the Church of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi>
conſiſted of more Congregations than one,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:153109:18"/>
from the multitude of Believers, from the many
Apoſtles, and other Preachers in that Church,
and from the diverſity of Languages among the
Believers. 2. That all theſe Congregations, were
under one Presbyteriall Government, becauſe they
were, for Government, one Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.
22, 26. And becauſe that Church was governed
by Elders, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 30. which were Elders of
that Church, and did meet together for Acts of
Government: And the Apoſtles themſelves,
in that meeting, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. acted not as Apoſtles,
but as Elders; ſtating the Question, debating it,
in the ordinary way of diſputation; and having,
by ſearch of Scripture, found the will of God, they
conclude, <hi>It ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt
and us:</hi> which in the judgement of the learned,
may be ſpoken by any Aſſembly, upon like evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Scripture. The like Presbyterian Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
had place in the Churches of <hi>Corinth,
Epheſus, Theſſalonica, &amp;c.</hi> in the times of the
Apoſtles; and after them, for many years, when
one of the Presbytery was made <hi>Epiſcopus Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
even then, <hi>Communi Presbyterorum Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filio,
Eccleſiae gubernabantur,</hi> ſaith <hi>Jerome;
&amp; Epiſcopos magis conſuetudine, quam Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitionis
Divinae veritate, Presbyteris eſſe
majores, &amp; in Commune debere Eccleſiam re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Farre be it from me to think ſuch a thought,
as that your Majeſty did intend any Fallacy, in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:153109:18"/>
your other maine Argument, from Antiquity. As
we are to diſtinguiſh between <hi>Intentio operantis,
&amp; Conditio operis;</hi> ſo may we in this caſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the difference between <hi>Intentio Argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantis,
&amp; Conditio Argumenti.</hi> And where
Your Majeſty argues, That, if Your Opinion be
not admitted, we will be forced to give place to
the <hi>Interpretation of private Spirits,</hi> which is
contrary to the Doctrine of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi>
and will prove to be of dangerous conſequence; I
humbly offer to be conſidered by Your Majesty,
what ſome of chief note among the <hi>Papiſts</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
have taught us, That the <hi>Interpretation</hi>
of <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and the <hi>Spirits</hi> whence they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
may be called <hi>private,</hi> in a threefold ſenſe.
1. <hi>Ratione Perſonae,</hi> if the Interpreter be of a
private condition. 2. <hi>Ratione Modi &amp; Medii,</hi>
when Perſons, although not private, uſe not the
publique meanes which are neceſſary for finding
out the Truth, but follow their owne fancies.
3. <hi>Ratione finis,</hi> when the Interpretation is not
propoſed as Authenticall to bind others, but is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
onely for our owne private ſatisfaction.
The firſt is not to be deſpiſed; the ſecond is to be
exploded, and is condemned by the Apoſtle <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi>
the third ought not to be cenſured: But that
Interpretation which is Authenticall, and of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Authority, which even mans conſcience is
bound to yeild unto, is of an higher nature. And,
although the Generall Councell ſhould reſolve it,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:153109:19"/>
and the Conſent of the Fathers ſhould be had unto
it, yet there muſt alwaies be place left to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Diſcretion, as <hi>Davenant,</hi> late Biſhop of
<hi>Salisbury,</hi> beſide divers others, hath learnedly
made appeare in his Booke, <hi>De Judice Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſiarum;</hi>
where alſo the Power of Kings in
matter of Religion, is ſolidly and unpartially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined.
Two words onely I adde; one is, that
notwithstanding all that is pretended from Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
a Biſhop having ſole power of Ordination
and Juriſdiction, will never be found in <hi>Prime
Antiquity.</hi> The other is, that many of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
did, unwittingly, bring forth that <hi>Anti-chriſt,</hi>
which was conceived in the times of the
Apoſtles, and therefore are incompetent Judges
in the Queſtion of <hi>Hierarchy.</hi> And upon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part, the Lights of the Christian Church, at,
and ſince the beginning of the Reformation, have
diſcovered many ſecrets, concerning the <hi>Anti-chriſt</hi>
and his <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> which were not knowne
to former Ages: And diverſe of the learned, in
the Roman Church, have not feared to pronounce,
That, whoſoever denies the true and literall ſenſe
of many Texts of Scripture, to have been found
out in this laſt Age, is unthankfull to God, who
hath ſo plentifully powred forth his Spirit upon
the Children of this Generation, and ungratefull
towards thoſe men, who with ſo great paines, ſo
happy ſucceſſe, &amp; ſo much benefit to Gods Church,
have travailed therein: This might be inſtanced
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:153109:19"/>
in many places of Scripture: I wind together
<hi>Diotrephes</hi> and the <hi>Myſtery of Iniquity,</hi> the
one, as an old example of Church-ambition, which
was alſo too palpable in the Apoſtles themſelves;
And the other as a cover of Ambition, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
diſcovered; which two, brought forth the
<hi>great Myſtery</hi> of the Papacy at laſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Although your Majeſty be not made a Judge
of the Reformed Churches, yet you ſo farre cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
them, and their actions, as, without Biſhops,
in your judgment, they cannot have a lawfull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery,
nor a due Adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
Againſt which dangerous &amp; deſtructive
Opinion, I did alledge what I ſuppoſed, your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
would not have denied, 1. That Presbyters
without a Biſhop, may Ordaine other Presbyters.
2. That Baptiſme, adminiſtred by ſuch a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter,
is another thing than Baptiſme admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
by a private Perſon, or by a Midwife. Of
the first your Majeſty calls for proofe: I told be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that in Scripture, it is manifeſt, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
4. 14. <hi>Neglect nor the Gift that is in Thee,
which was given Thee by the Propheſie, with
the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery;</hi>
ſo it is in the Engliſh Tranſlation: And the word
<hi>Presbytery,</hi> ſo often as it is uſed in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,
alwaies ſignifies the <hi>Perſons,</hi> and not
the <hi>Office.</hi> And although the Offices of <hi>Biſhop</hi>
and <hi>Presbyter</hi> were distinct; yet doth not the
<hi>Presbyter</hi> derive his power of Order, from the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:153109:20"/>
                  <hi>Biſhop.</hi> The Evangeliſts were inferiour to the
Apostles; yet had they their power, not from the
Apoſtles, but from Chriſt: The ſame I affirme
of the 70 Diſciples, who had their power imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
from Christ, no leſſe than the Apoſtles
had theirs. It may upon better reaſon be aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that the Biſhops have their power from the
Pope, than that Presbyters have their power from
the Prelats. It is true, <hi>Jerome</hi> ſaith, <hi>Quid facit,
exceptâ ordinatione Epiſcopus, quod non facit
Presbyter;</hi> but in the ſame place he proves from
Scripture, that <hi>Epiſcopus &amp; Presbyter</hi> are one
and the ſame; and therefore when he appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates
Ordination to the Biſhop, he ſpeaketh of the
degenerated cuſtome of his time. 2. Concerning
<hi>Baptiſme,</hi> a private Perſon may perform the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Action and Rites, both of it and of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist;
yet is neither of the two a Sacrament, or
hath any efficacy, unleſſe it be done by him that
is lawfully called thereunto, or by a Perſon made
publique and clothed with Authority by Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
This Errour in the matter of Baptiſme, is
begot by another Errour, of the Abſolute Neceſsity
of Baptiſme.</p>
               <p n="7">7. To that which hath been ſaid, concerning
Your Majeſties <hi>Oath,</hi> I ſhall adde nothing; not
being willing to enter upon the Queſtion, of the
ſubordination of the Church to the Civill power,
whether to King, or Parliament, or both, and to
either of them, in their owne place. Such an
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:153109:20"/>
Headſhip as the Kings of <hi>England</hi> hath claimed,
and ſuch a ſupremacy as the Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
crave, with Appeales from the ſupreme
Eccleſiaſticall Judicature to them as ſet over the
Church, in the ſame line of Subordination, I doe
utterly diſclaime upon ſuch Reaſons as give my
ſelfe ſatisfaction, although no man ſhall be more
willing to ſubmit to Civill Powers, each one
in their owne place; and more unwilling to
make any trouble than my ſelfe: Onely concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the application of the Generalls of an Oath,
to the particular caſe now in hand; under fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor,
I conceive not how the Clergy of the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> is, or ought to be principally inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
in your Oath: For, although they were eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to be the Repreſentative Church, yet even
that is for the benefit of the Church Collective,
<hi>Salus Populi,</hi> being <hi>Suprema Lex,</hi> and to be
principally intended. Your Majeſty knowes it
was ſo in the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> where the like
alteration was made. And, if nothing of this
kind can be done without the conſent of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
what Reformation can be expected in <hi>France,</hi>
or <hi>Spaine,</hi> or <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelfe? It is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
that the Pope, or Prelate will conſent to
their owne ruine.</p>
               <p n="8">8. I will not preſume upon any ſecret knowledge
of the Opinions held by the King, Your Majeſties
Father, of famous Memory; they being much
better known to Your Majeſty, I did onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:153109:21"/>
what was profeſt by him, before the world:
And although <hi>Prayers and Tears be the Arms
of the Church;</hi> yet, it is neither acceptable to
God, nor conducible for Kings and Princes, to
<hi>force the Church to put on theſe Armes:</hi> Nor
could I ever heare a reaſon, why a neceſſary De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive
Warre againſt unjuſt Violence is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
although it be joyned with offence and inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
which is intended for Defence, but ſo that
Armes are layed down when the offenſive Warre
ceaſeth: by which it doth appeare, that the Warre
on the other ſide, was, in the nature thereof, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Concerning the forcing of Conſcience, which
I pretermitted in my other Paper, I am forced
now, but without forcing of my Conſcience, to
ſpeake of. Our Conſcience may be ſaid to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced;
either by our ſelves, or by others. By our
ſelves, 1. when we ſtop the eare of our Conſcience
and will not hearken, or give place to informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
reſolving obſtinately, <hi>Ne ſi perſuaſeris,
perſuadebis;</hi> which is no leſſe then a reſiſting of
the Holy Ghoſt, and the hardning of our hearts.
2. Or when we ſtop the mouth, and ſuppreſſe the
clamours of our Conſcience; reſolving rather to
ſuffer the worme to gnaw, and the fire to burne
inwardly, then to make profeſsion of that we are
convinced to be Truth. 3. Or when we ſeare our
Conſcience, as with an hot Iron, that it becometh
ſenſleſſe; which is the puniſhment of the former:
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:153109:21"/>
unto which is oppoſed, the truly tender Conſcience;
ſuch as <hi>Joſiah</hi> had, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 22. 19. Againe,
1. our <hi>Conſcience</hi> is ſaid to be forced by others,
when they obtrude upon us what is in it ſelf evill
and unlawfull; which if we admit, againſt our
own Conſcience, we ſin, two waies; one is, <hi>by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that which is in it ſelf evill and unlawfull;</hi>
the other is, <hi>by doing it againſt a dictate of
Conſcience,</hi> which is a contempt of God, whoſe
Vicegerent it is. 2. Or when others urge us to do
that which is in it ſelfe good, or may lawfully be
done, but through error of Conſcience, we judge
it to be evill and unlawfull: in this caſe, if we do
not that which is preſt upon us, we ſin, becauſe the
thing is good and lawfull: And if we doe it, we
ſin, becauſe we do againſt our Conſcience. Which
in this caſe bindeth, but obligeth not: And yet
there is a way to eſcape out of this labyrinth, it
being repugnant to the equity of the will of God
to lay a <hi>neceſſity</hi> of ſinning upon any man: The
onely way is, <hi>to lay aſide ſuch a Conſcience,</hi> it
being a part of the Old man, which we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to <hi>put off;</hi> otherwiſe, we being ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
informed, and yet cleaving to our old error,
we rather doe violence to our Conſcience our
ſelves than ſuffer violence from others. The Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
for Anſwering the <hi>Quaere,</hi> I leave to
your Majesty.</p>

               <p n="1">1. IT were arrogance, beſides loſſe of time,
in Me to vie <hi>preambles</hi> with you; For, it
is <hi>truth</hi> I ſeek, and neither <hi>praiſe,</hi> nor <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory;</hi>
wherefore I ſhall onely inſiſt upon thoſe
things which are meerly neceſſary to my owne
ſatisfaction; in order to which, I deſired the
<hi>aſsistance</hi> of ſome <hi>Divines;</hi> whereupon I will
inſiſt no further, ſave onely to wiſh, that you
may not (as I have knowne many Men doe)
<hi>loſe</hi> time by being miſtaken in the way to <hi>ſave</hi>
it, wherein I have onely ſought to disburden
My ſelfe, but to lay no blame upon you, and
ſo I leave it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor will I ſay more of the ſecond then
this, that I am glad you have ſo well approved
of what I have ſaid concerning My <hi>education</hi>
and <hi>reaſon;</hi> but then remember, that <hi>another
Mans will,</hi> is at leaſt, as weake a ground, to
build my Faith upon, as my former <hi>education.</hi>

3. In this there are two points; Firſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Reforming power,</hi> then anent the
<hi>Engliſh Reformation;</hi> For the firſt, I confeſſe
you now ſpeak clearly, which before you did
but darkly mention, wherein I ſhall mainly
differ with you, untill you ſhall ſhew me better
reaſon: yet thus farre I will goe along with
you, that when a <hi>Generall Councell</hi> cannot be
had, ſeverall <hi>Kingdomes</hi> may <hi>Reforme</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
(which is learnedly and fully proved
by the late <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
againſt <hi>Fiſher</hi>) but, that the <hi>inferior
Magiſtrates</hi> or <hi>People</hi> (take it which way you
will) have this <hi>power,</hi> I utterly deny; For
which, by your favour, you have yet made no
ſufficient proofe, to my judgement: Indeed,
if you could have brought, or can bring autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Scripture, for this opinion, I would and
will, yet, with all reverence ſubmit; but as for
<hi>your Examples, out of the Old Teſtament,</hi> in my
mind, they rather make for, than againſt me,
all thoſe <hi>Reformations</hi> being made by <hi>Kings;</hi>
and it is a good <hi>probable</hi> (though I will not ſay
<hi>convincing) Argument,</hi> that if God would have
approved of a <hi>Popular reforming way,</hi> there
were <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Judah</hi> &amp; <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſufficiently neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
and ill to have made ſuch examples by;
but by the contrary, the 16. Chap. of <hi>Numbers</hi>
ſhewes clearly, how God <hi>diſapproves</hi> of ſuch
courſes: but I forget this Aſſertion is to be
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:153109:23"/>
proved by you; yet I may put you in the way,
wherefore let me tell you that this <hi>pretended
power</hi> in the <hi>People,</hi> muſt (as all others) either
be directly, or elſe declaratorily by approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
given by God; which, how ſoon you can
doe, I ſubmit; otherwiſe you prove nothing:
For the citing of private Mens opinions (more
then as they concurre with the <hi>generall conſent
of the Church</hi> in their time) weighs little with
Me, it being too well known, that <hi>Rebels never
wanted Writers to maintain their unjuſt actions;</hi>
and though I much reverence Biſhop <hi>Jewels</hi>
memory, I never thought him <hi>infallible;</hi> for
<hi>Bilſon</hi> I remember well what opinion the <hi>King</hi>
my <hi>Father</hi> had of him for thoſe Opinions, and
how He ſhewed him ſome favour in hope of his
<hi>recantation,</hi> (as His good nature made Him do
many things of that kind) but whether he did,
or not, I cannot ſay: To conclude this point,
untill you ſhall prove this <hi>poſition</hi> by the <hi>word
of God,</hi> (as I will <hi>Regall Authority</hi>) I ſhall think
all <hi>popular Reformation,</hi> little better than <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions;</hi>
for, I hold that <hi>no Authority is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
but that which is either directly given, or</hi> at
leaſt, <hi>approved by God.</hi> 2ly. Concerning the
<hi>Engliſh Reformation,</hi> the firſt reaſon you bring
why Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did not finiſh it, is, <hi>becauſe
ſhe tooke not away Epiſcopacy,</hi> the <hi>hits of reaſon
againſt which Government,</hi> you ſay, <hi>I take no
notice of;</hi> now I thought it was ſufficient no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:153109:23"/>
yea and anſwer too, when I told you, <hi>a
negative</hi> (as I conceived) <hi>could not be proved,</hi>
and that it was for Me to prove the <hi>affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;</hi>
which I ſhall either doe, or yeild the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
as ſoone as I ſhall be aſſiſted with
<hi>Bookes,</hi> or ſuch <hi>Men</hi> of My opinion, who, like
you, have a Library in their braine: And ſo
I muſt leave this particular, untill I be furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
with <hi>means</hi> to put it to an <hi>iſſue;</hi> which had
been ſooner done, if I could have had My will:
indeed your ſecond well proved, is moſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
which is, That <hi>the Engliſh Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
is not builded upon the foundation of
Chriſt and the Apoſtles;</hi> but I conceive your
probation of this, doubly defective; for firſt,
albeit our <hi>Archbiſhops</hi> and <hi>Biſhops</hi> ſhould have
profeſſed <hi>Church-Government</hi> to be <hi>mutable &amp;
ambulatory,</hi> I conceive it not ſufficient to prove
your Aſſertion: and ſecondly, I am confident
you cannot prove, that moſt of them maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
this <hi>walking</hi> poſition, (for ſome particulars
muſt not conclude the generall) for which you
muſt find much better Arguments than their
being content with the <hi>Conſtitution of the
Church,</hi> and the <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>munificence of
Princes,</hi> or you will fall extreamly ſhort: As
for the <hi>retaining</hi> of the <hi>Roman leven,</hi> you muſt
prove it, as well as ſay it, elſe you ſay little:
But that the conforming of the <hi>Church diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi>
to the <hi>civill policy,</hi> ſhould be a depraving
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:153109:24"/>
of it, I abſolutely deny; for I averre, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it, the Church can neither flouriſh, nor be
happy: And for your laſt inſtance, you ſhall
doe well to ſhew the prohibition of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
againſt addition of more Officers in the
Church than he named; and yet in one ſenſe I
doe not conceive that the Church of <hi>England</hi>
hath added any; for, an <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> is onely
a diſtinction for <hi>order</hi> of <hi>Government,</hi> not a
<hi>new Officer,</hi> and ſo of the reſt; and of this
kind, I believe there are diverſe now in <hi>Scotland</hi>
which you will not condemne, as the <hi>Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of Aſſemblies,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Where you find a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi>
in Scripture, to be one and the ſame (which I
deny to be alwaies ſo) it is in the <hi>Apoſtles time;</hi>
now I think to prove the Order of <hi>Biſhops</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
that of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and that the name
was chiefly altered, in reverence to thoſe who
were immediately choſen by our <hi>Saviour,</hi> (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit,
in their time, they cauſed diverſe to be
called ſo, as <hi>Barnabas</hi> and others) ſo that, I
believe, this Argument makes little for you:
As for your proofe of the antiquity of <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian
Government,</hi> it is well that the <hi>Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of Divines at Weſtminſter</hi> can doe more
then <hi>Euſebius</hi> could, and I ſhal believe, when I
ſee it; for, your former Paper affirmes, that
thoſe times were very dark for matter of fact,
and will be ſo ſtill for me if there be no clearer
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:153109:24"/>
Arguments to prove it, than thoſe you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
for, becauſe there were <hi>diverſe Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in Jeruſalem;</hi> ergo, <hi>what?</hi> are there not
<hi>divers Pariſhes in one Dioceſse?</hi> (your two firſt
I anſwer but as one Argument) and becauſe
the <hi>Apostles met with thoſe of the inferiour Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
for Acts of Government;</hi> what then? even
ſo in theſe times doe the <hi>Deanes</hi> and <hi>Chapters,</hi>
and many times thoſe of the <hi>inferiour Clergy</hi>
aſſiſt the <hi>Biſhops;</hi> but I hope you will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to ſay, that there was an equality between
the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and other <hi>Presbyters,</hi> which not
being, doth (in my judgment) quite invalidate
theſe Arguments: And if you can ſay no more
for the Churches of <hi>Corinth, Epheſus, Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonica,
&amp;c.</hi> than you have for <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> it
will gaine no ground on me: As for Saint <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi>
it is well knowne that he was no great
Friend to Biſhops, as being none himſelfe, yet
take him altogether, and you will find that he
makes a clear diſtinction between a <hi>Biſhop</hi> and
a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> as your ſelf confeſſes; but the truth
is, he was angry with thoſe who maintained
<hi>Deacons</hi> to be equall to <hi>Presbyters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. I am well ſatisfied with the explanation
of your meaning concerning the word <hi>Fallacy,</hi>
though I think to have had reaſon for ſaying
what I did: but by your favour, I doe not
conceive that you have anſwered the ſtrength
of my Argument, for when you and I differ
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:153109:25"/>
upon the <hi>interpretation of Scripture,</hi> and I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale
to the <hi>practiſe</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi>
and <hi>the univerſall conſent of the Fathers,</hi> to be
judge between us, methinks you ſhould either
find a fitter, or ſubmit to what I offer; neither
of which (to My underſtanding) you have yet
done; nor have you ſhewne how, waving thoſe
Judges I appeale unto, the miſchief, of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
by <hi>private Spirits,</hi> can be preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Indeed, if I cannot prove by <hi>antiquity,</hi>
that <hi>Ordination</hi> and <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> belongs to
<hi>Biſhops,</hi> (thereby cleerly diſtinguiſhing them
from other <hi>Presbyters</hi>) I ſhall then begin to
miſdoubt many of my former <hi>foundations;</hi>
(as for Biſhop <hi>Davenant,</hi> he is none of thoſe, to
whom I have appealed, or will ſubmit unto)
but for the exception you take to <hi>Fathers,</hi> I
take it to be <hi>a begging of the Question;</hi> as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
thoſe great diſcoveries of ſecrets, not
knowne to former Ages, I ſhall call <hi>new-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
fancies,</hi> untill particularly you ſhall
prove the contrary; and for your <hi>Roman Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours,</hi>
it is no great wonder for them to ſeek
ſhifts whereby to maintaine <hi>Novelties,</hi> as well
as the <hi>Puritans:</hi> As for <hi>Church-ambition,</hi> it
doth not at all terminate, in ſeeking to be <hi>Pope;</hi>
for, I take it to be no point of humility to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to be <hi>independent of Kings,</hi> it being
poſſible, that <hi>Papacy</hi> in a <hi>multitude</hi> may be as
dangerous as in <hi>one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:153109:25"/>
6. As I am no <hi>Judge</hi> over the <hi>Reformed
Churches,</hi> ſo neither doe I cenſure them, for
many things may be avowable upon <hi>neceſsity,</hi>
which otherwaies are <hi>unlawfull;</hi> but know,
once for all, that I eſteeme nothing the better
becauſe it is done by ſuch a <hi>particular Church</hi>
(though it were by the <hi>Church of England,</hi>
which I avow moſt to reverence) but I eſteem
that <hi>Church</hi> moſt, which comes neareſt to the
<hi>purity of the primitive Doctrine and Diſcipline,</hi>
as I believe this doth. Now concerning <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi>
I bad you prove that <hi>Presbyters</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a <hi>Biſhop</hi> might lawfully <hi>ordaine,</hi> which yet
I conceive you have not done; for, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 6.
it is evident, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was at <hi>Timothies
ordination;</hi> and albeit that all the <hi>Seventy</hi> had
their power immediately from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> yet it is
as evident that our <hi>Saviour</hi> made a clear diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
between the <hi>twelve Apoſtles</hi> and the reſt
of the <hi>Diſciples,</hi> which is ſet downe by three of
the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> whereof S. <hi>Marke</hi> calls it <hi>an
Ordination, Mark</hi> 3. 15. &amp; S. <hi>Luke</hi> ſayes, <hi>And
of them he choſe Twelve, &amp;c. Luke</hi> 6. 13. onely
S. <hi>Matthew</hi> doth but barely enumerate them
by their <hi>name</hi> of diſtinction, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 1. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
out of modeſty, himſelfe being one, and
the other two being none, are more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.
For <hi>the adminiſtration of Baptiſme,</hi> giving,
but not granting what you ſay, it makes more
for Me, than you: but I will not engage up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:153109:26"/>
new Queſtions, not neceſſary for my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p n="7">7. For my <hi>Oath,</hi> you doe well not to enter
upon thoſe Queſtions you mention; and you
had done as well to have omitted your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;
but, out of diſcretion, I deſire you to
collect your Anſwer out of the laſt Section;
and for your Argument, though the intention
of my Oath be for the good of the <hi>Church col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective,</hi>
therefore can I be diſpenſed withall by
others than the <hi>repreſentative Body?</hi> certainly
no more than the People can diſpenſe with me
for any <hi>Oaths</hi> I took in their favours, without
the two Houſes of Parliament; as for future
reformations, I will only tell you that <hi>incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modum
non ſolvit Argumentum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. For the <hi>King</hi> my <hi>Fathers</hi> opinion, if it
were not to ſpend time (as I believe) needleſly,
I could prove by living and written teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
all, and more, then I have ſaid of Him,
for His perſwaſion in theſe points which I now
maintain; and for your <hi>defenſive War,</hi> as I do
acknowledge it a great ſin for any <hi>King</hi> to <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
the Church,</hi> ſo I hold it abſolutely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
for <hi>Subjects</hi> (upon any pretence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever)
to make <hi>War</hi> (though <hi>defenſive</hi>) againſt
their <hi>lawfull Soveraigne;</hi> againſt which no leſs
proofs will make me yeild but <hi>Gods word;</hi> and
let Me tell you, that upon ſuch points as theſe,
<hi>inſtances,</hi> as well as <hi>compariſons,</hi> are <hi>odious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:153109:26"/>
9. Laſtly, you miſtake the <hi>Quaere</hi> in my firſt
Paper to which this pretends to anſwer; for my
Queſtion was not concerning <hi>force of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
(for I never doubted the lawfulneſſe of
it) but <hi>force of Armes,</hi> to which, I conceive, it
ſayes little or nothing, unleſſe (after My ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample)
you refer Me to the former Section; that
which it doth, is meerly the <hi>asking of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,</hi>
after a fine diſcourſe of the ſeveral wayes
of <hi>perſwading</hi> rather than <hi>forcing</hi> of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
I cloſe up this Paper, deſiring you to
take notice, that there is none of theſe Sections
but I could have enlarged to many more lines,
ſome to whole pages; yet I choſe to be thus
brief, knowing you will underſtand more by a
word than others by a long diſcourſe; truſting
likewiſe to your ingenuity, that <hi>reaſon epito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mized,</hi>
will weigh as much with you as if it
were at large.</p>

               <p>HAving in my former Papers preſſed the
ſteps of your Majesties Propoſitions,
and finding by your Majeſties last Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
Controverſies to be multiplyed, (I believe)
beyond your Majeſties intentions in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
As concerning the <hi>Reforming Power:</hi>
The <hi>Reformation of the Church of England;</hi>
The <hi>difference betwixt a Biſhop and a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi>
The <hi>warrants of Presbyterian Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
The <hi>Authority of Interpreting Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi>
The <hi>taking and keeping of Publique
Oathes;</hi> The <hi>forcing of Conſcience;</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other inferior and ſubordinate Questions,
which are Branches of thoſe maine Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies:
All which in a ſatisfactory manner to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
in few words, I leave to more preſuming
Spirits, who either ſee no knots of Difficulties,
or can find a way rather to cut them aſſunder, than
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:153109:27"/>
to unlooſe them: yet will I not uſe any Tergiver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation;
nor doe I decline to offer my humble Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with the Reaſons thereof, in the owne time
concerning each of them; which in obedience to
your Majeſties command, I have begun to doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>already.
Onely Sir, by your Majeſties favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
permiſsion, for the greater expedition, and
that the preſent velitations may be brought to
ſome iſſue, I am bold to entreat that the Method
may be a little altered, and I may have leave
now to begin at a Principle, and that which ſhould
have been, <hi>inter Precognita;</hi> I meane the Rule,
by which we are to proceed, and to determine the
preſent Controverſie of <hi>Church policy;</hi> without
which we will be led into a labyrinth, and want a
thred to wind us out againe. In your Majeſties
firſt Paper, the <hi>univerſall cuſtome of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Church,</hi> is conceived to be the Rule. In
the ſecond Paper, Section the 5. The <hi>practiſe</hi> of
the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> and the <hi>univerſall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of the Fathers,</hi> is made a convincing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
when the <hi>Interpretation of Scripture</hi> is
doubtfull; In your third Paper, Sect. 5. <hi>the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the Primitive Church, and the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall
conſent of the Fathers,</hi> is made Judge; and
I know, that nothing is more ordinary in this
Question, then to alleage <hi>Antiquity, perpetuall
Succeſſion, univerſall Conſent of the Fathers,</hi>
and the <hi>univerſall practiſe</hi> of the <hi>Primitive
Church,</hi> according to the Rule of <hi>Auguſtine,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:153109:28"/>
Quod univerſa tenet Eccleſia, nec à Conſilio
inſtitutum, ſed ſemper retentum eſt, non, niſi
Authoritate Apoſtolicâ, traditum rectiſſime
creditur.</hi> There is in this Argument at the firſt
view, ſo much appearance of Reaſon, that it may
much worke upon a modeſt mind; yet being well
examined and rightly weighed it will be found to
be of no great weight; for beſide that the minor
will never be made good in the behalfe of a <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caeſan
Biſhop,</hi> having ſole power of Ordination
and Juriſdiction, there being a multitude of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who maintaine that <hi>Biſhop and Presbyter
are of one and the ſame Order;</hi> I ſhall humbly
offer ſome few Conſiderations about the major,
becauſe it hath been an inlet to many dangerous
Errors, and hath proved a mighty hinderance
and obſtruction to Reformation of Religion.</p>
               <p>1. Firſt, I deſire it may be conſidered, that
whiles ſome make two Rules for defining Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies;
the word of God and antiquity, (which
they will have to be received with equall venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
or, as the Papiſts call them, <hi>Canonicall
Authority, and Catholicall Tradition;</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
make <hi>Scripture</hi> to be the onely <hi>Rule, and
Antiquity</hi> the authentick <hi>Interpreter;</hi> the latter
of the two ſeemes to me to be the greater errour:
becauſe the firſt ſetteth up a <hi>parallel,</hi> in the ſame
degree with Scripture; but this would create a
Superior, in a higher degree above Scripture:
For the <hi>interpretation</hi> of the Fathers ſhall be
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:153109:28"/>
the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and accounted the very Cauſe and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for which we conceive and believe ſuch a
place of Scripture to have ſuch a ſence; and thus,
Men ſhall have Dominion over our Faith, againſt
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24. Our faith ſhall ſtand in the wiſdome
of man, and not in the power of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 5.
and Scripture ſhall be of private interpretation;
For the Propheſie came not of old by the will of
man, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 20, 22. <hi>Niſi homini Deus placu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erit,
Deus non erit, Homo jam Deo propitius
eſſe debebit,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tertullian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. That Scripture cannot be Authentically in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
but by Scripture, is manifest from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture:
The Levites gave the ſenſe of the Law by
no other means, but by Scripture it ſelf, <hi>Neh.</hi> 8. 8.
Our Saviour for example to us, gave the true
ſenſe of Scripture, against the depravations of
Satan, by comparing Scripture with Scripture,
and not by alleaging any Teſtimonies out of the
Rabbins, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. And the Apoſtles, in their
Epistles; uſed no other help, but the diligent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
of Propheticall writings; like as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
<hi>Peter,</hi> will have us to compare the clearer
light of the Apoſtles, with the more obſcure
light of the Prophets, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19. And when we
betake our ſelves to the Fathers, we have need to
take heed, that, with the Papists, we accuſe not
the Scriptures of obſcurity or imperfection.</p>
               <p>3. The Fathers themſelves (as they are cited
by Proteſtant Writers) hold this Concluſion, that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:153109:29"/>
Scripture is not to be interpreted, but by Scripture
it ſelfe: To this purpoſe, amongst many other Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies,
they bring the ſaying of <hi>Tertullian,
Surge veritas, ipſa Scripturas tuas interpretare,
quam Conſuetudo non novit; nam ſi noſcet,
non eſſet:</hi> if it knew Scripture, it would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed
of it ſelfe, and ceaſe to be any more.</p>
               <p>4. That ſome Errors have been received, and
continued for a long time, in the Church: The
Error of <hi>Free will</hi> beginning at <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi>
continued till the time of <hi>Reformation,</hi> although
it was rejected by <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> as the <hi>Divine
Right of Epiſcopacy</hi> was oppoſed by others. The
Error about the <hi>Viſion of God,</hi> That <hi>the Souls
of the Saints departed, ſee not the face of God,
till the Judgment of the Great Day,</hi> was held
by Univerſall Conſent: the ſame may be ſaid of
the error of the Millenaryes; and, which more
nearly toucheth upon the preſent Queſtion, the
Auncients erred groſly about the <hi>Antichriſt</hi> and
<hi>Myſtery of Iniquity,</hi> which did begin to worke
in the dayes of the Apoſtles. Many other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
might be brought to prove the <hi>univerſall
practiſe of the Church,</hi> as were not warranted by
the Apoſtles; as in the Rites of <hi>Baptiſme and
Prayer;</hi> and the forming up and drawing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
of the Articles of that Creed, that is called
<hi>Symbolum Apoſtolicum;</hi> the obſervation of
many <hi>Feaſts</hi> and <hi>Faſts</hi> both Aniverſary and
Weekly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:153109:29"/>
5. That it is not a matter ſo incredible, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible,
as ſome would have it appeare to be, for
the Primitive Church to have made a ſudden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
from the Apoſtolicall purity: The people
of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in the ſhort time of <hi>Moſes</hi> his abſence
on the Mount, turned aſide quickly, and fell into
horrible Idolatry, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. ſoone after the death
of <hi>Joſuah,</hi> and the Elders that had ſeen the great
works, which the Lord had done for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> there
aroſe another Generation after them, which did
evill in the ſight of the Lord, <hi>Judg. 2. &amp;</hi> 7. ſoone
after the building of the Temple, and ſetling of
Religion by <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Salomon,</hi> the worſhip of
God was defiled with Idolatry: when <hi>Rehoboam</hi>
had eſtabliſhed the Kingdome, he forſook the Law
of the Lord, and all <hi>Iſrael</hi> with him, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>
12. 1. And the Apoſtle ſayes to the Galatians,
<hi>Gal. 1. 6. I marvell that you are ſo ſoone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
unto another Goſpel:</hi> why then ſhall
we thinke it ſtrange, that in the matter of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
there ſhould be a ſudden defection, eſpecially
it being begun in the time of the Apostles? I
know it is a common Opinion, but I believe there
be no ſtrong reaſons for it, that the Church which
was neareſt the times of the Apoſtles was the moſt
pure and perfect Church.</p>
               <p>6. That it is impoſsible to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Univerſall Conſent and Practice of
the Primitive Church: for many of the Fathers
wrote nothing at all, many of their writings are
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:153109:30"/>
periſhed, (it may be that both of theſe have diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the reſt) many of the Writings which we
have under their names are ſuppoſititius, &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit,
eſpecially about Epiſcopacy which was the
foundation of Papall Primacy: The Rule of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi>
afore-mentioned doth too much favour
Traditions, and is not to be admitted, without
cautions and exceptions.</p>
               <p>Many the like Conſiderations may be added;
but theſe may be ſufficient to prove, that the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous
Conſent of the Fathers, and the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall
practice of the Primitive Church, is no ſure
ground of Authenticall interpretation of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
I remember of a grave Divine in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
much honoured by K. <hi>James</hi> of happy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
who did often profeſſe that he did learne
more of one Page of <hi>John Calvin,</hi> then of a whole
Treatiſe of <hi>Auguſtine:</hi> nor can there be any
good reaſon, (many there be againſt it) why the
Ancients ſhould be ſo farre preferred to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne
Doctors of the Reformed Churches, and the
one in a manner Deified, and the other vilified:
It is but a poor Reaſon that ſome give, <hi>Fama mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratrix
ſenioris aevi,</hi> and is abundantly anſwered
by the Apologiſt for Divine Providence. If your
Majeſty be ſtill unſatisfied concerning the Rule,
I know not to what purpoſe I ſhould proceed or
trouble your Majeſty any more.</p>

            <p>I Shall very willingly follow the <hi>method</hi> you
have begun in your third Paper; but I doe
not conceive, that My laſt Paper multiplies
more Controverſies than My firſt gave acca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
for; having been ſo far from augmenting
the Heads of our Diſputation, that I have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the anſwering many things, in both
your Papers, expreſly to avoid raiſing of new
and needleſſe <hi>Questions;</hi> deſiring to have only
ſo many debated, as are ſimply neceſſary to
ſhew, whether, or not, <hi>I may with a ſafe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
give way to the alteration of Church-Government
in England;</hi> and indeed I like ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well, to begin with the <hi>ſetling of the Rule,</hi> by
which We are to proceed, and determine the
preſent <hi>Controverſie;</hi> to which purpoſe (as I
conceive) My third Paper ſhewes you an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
way; for there, I offer you a <hi>Judge</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us, or deſire you to <hi>finde out a better,</hi>
which, to My judgement, you have not yet
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:153109:31"/>
done, (though you have ſought to invalidate
Mine) For, if you underſtand to have offered
the <hi>Scripture,</hi> though no Man ſhall pay more
reverence, nor ſubmit more humbly to it, than
My ſelf; yet We muſt find ſome rule to judge
betwixt us, when you and I differ upon the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation</hi>
of the ſelf-ſame Text, or it can
never determine our Queſtions; as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
I ſay you miſapply that of 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 14.
to <hi>Me</hi> (let others anſwer for themſelves) for I
know not how I make <hi>other Men to have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
over My Faith,</hi> when I make them onely
<hi>ſerve</hi> to <hi>approve My reaſon;</hi> nor doe I conceive
how, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 5. can be applied to this purpoſe;
For there Saint <hi>Paul</hi> onely ſhewes the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Humane Eloquence,</hi>
making no mention of any kind of <hi>interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
throughout the whole Chapter, as indeed
Saint <hi>Peter</hi> does, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 20. which I conceive
makes for <hi>Me;</hi> for, ſince that no <hi>Propheſie of
Scripture is of any private interpretation;</hi> Firſt,
I inferre, that <hi>Scripture</hi> is to be <hi>Interpreted;</hi>
for elſe, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> would have omitted the
word <hi>Private:</hi> Secondly, that at leaſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of many learned Divines is neceſſary, and
ſo <hi>à fortiore,</hi> that of the <hi>Catholique Church,</hi>
ought to be an <hi>authentique Judge,</hi> when Men
differ: And is it a good Argument? becauſe
(<hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 4. 7. 10.) Scripture is beſt interpreted by
it ſelfe, therefore that all other interpretations
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:153109:31"/>
are unlawfull? certainfull you cannot thinke:
Thus having ſhewed you that We differ, about
the <hi>meaning</hi> of the Scripture, and are like to do
ſo; certainly there ought to be for this, as well
as other things, a <hi>Rule</hi> or a <hi>Judge</hi> between us,
to determine our differences, or, at leaſt, to
make our Probations and Arguments <hi>Rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant;</hi>
therefore evading, for this time, to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
your 6 <hi>Conſiderations</hi> (not I aſſure you
for the difficulty of them, but the ſtarting of
new Queſtions) I deſire you onely to ſhew Me

            <p>UNtill you ſhall finde out a <hi>fitter way</hi> to
decide our <hi>Difference</hi> in Opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Interpretation of Scripture</hi> than
the <hi>Conſent of the Fathers, and the Univerſall
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:153109:32"/>
Practice of the Primitive Church,</hi> I cannot but
paſſe you My Judgment anent thoſe 6 <hi>Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,</hi>
which you offered to invalidate thoſe
Authorities, that I ſo much reverence.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the firſt you mention <hi>two Rules for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining
of Controverſies,</hi> and ſeeke a moſt old
way to confute them, as I thinke; For you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage,
that <hi>there is more attributed to them,</hi> then
I believe you can prove, by the Conſent of
moſt learned Men (there being no Queſtion,
but there are alwaies ſome flattering Fooles
that can commend nothing but with hyperpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
expreſſions) and you know that <hi>ſuppoſito
quolibet, ſequitur quidlibet;</hi> beſides doe you
thinke, that albeit ſome ignorant Fellowes,
ſhould attribute more power to <hi>Presbyters,</hi> than
is really due unto them, that thereby their juſt
reverence and authority is diminiſhed? So I
ſee no reaſon why I may not ſafely maintaine
that the <hi>Interpretation of Fathers,</hi> is a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<hi>ſtrengthning</hi> to My Opinion, though
Others ſhould attribute the <hi>Cauſe</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi>
of their Faith unto it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As there is no Queſtion, but that <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
is the farre <hi>beſt Interpreter</hi> of it ſelfe, ſo I
ſee nothing in this, negatively proved, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
any other, notwithſtanding your poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
affirmation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Nor in the next, for I hope you will not
be the firſt to condemne your ſelfe, Me, and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:153109:32"/>
innumerable Others, who yet unblamably have
not tyed themſelves to this Rule.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If in this you onely intend to prove, that
<hi>Errors</hi> were alwaies <hi>breeding in the Church,</hi> I
ſhall not deny it, yet that makes little (as I
conceive) to your purpoſe; but if your meaning
be, to accuſe the <hi>Univerſall Practice of the
Church</hi> with <hi>Error,</hi> I muſt ſay it is a very bold
undertaking; and, (if you cannot juſtifie your
ſelfe by cleare places in Scripture) much to be
blamed, wherein you muſt not alleage, that to
be univerſally received, which was not, as I
dare ſay, that the <hi>Controverſie about Free will,</hi>
was never yet decided, by <hi>Oecumenicall,</hi> or
<hi>Generall Councell;</hi> nor muſt you preſume to
call that an <hi>Error,</hi> which really the <hi>Catholique
Church</hi> maintained (as in <hi>Rites of Baptiſme,
Formes of Prayer, Obſervation of Feaſts,
Faſts,</hi> &amp;c.) except you can prove it ſo by the
Word of God; and it is not enough to ſay,
that ſuch a thing was not warranted by the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,</hi>
but you muſt prove by their <hi>Doctrine,</hi>
that ſuch a thing was <hi>unlawfull,</hi> or elſe the <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the Church</hi> is warrant enough for Me
to follow and obey that Cuſtome whatſoever
it be, and thinke it good, and ſhall believe that
the <hi>Apoſtles Creed</hi> was made by them, (ſuch
<hi>Reverence</hi> I beare to the <hi>Churches Tradition</hi>)
untill other Authors be certainly found out.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I was taught that <hi>de poſſe ad eſſe</hi> was no
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:153109:33"/>
good Argument; and indeed to Me it is incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible,
that any <hi>cuſtome of the Catholike Church</hi>
was erroneous, which was not contradicted, by
<hi>Orthodox,</hi> learned Men, in the times of their
firſt Practice, as is eaſily perceived that all
thoſe <hi>Defections</hi> were, (ſome of them may be
juſtly called <hi>Rebellions</hi>) which you mention.</p>
            <p n="6">6. I deny it is <hi>impoſsible,</hi> (though I confeſſe
it <hi>difficult</hi>) to come to the knowledge of the
<hi>Univerſall Conſent, and Practice of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Church,</hi> therefore I confeſſe a Man ought
to be <hi>carefull</hi> how to believe things of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
wherefore I conceive this to be onely an
Argument for <hi>Caution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Concluſion is, that albeit I never eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
any <hi>Authority</hi> equall to the <hi>Scriptures;</hi>
yet I doe think the <hi>Unanimous Conſent of the
Fathers,</hi> and the <hi>Univerſall Practice of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Church, to be the beſt and moſt Authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Interpreters of Gods word,</hi> and conſequently
the fitteſt Judges between Me and you, when
we differ, untill you ſhall find Me better: For

erre, and poſſibly a better <hi>Preacher</hi> may come,
but till then, muſt retaine My Opinion.</p>
