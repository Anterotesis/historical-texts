            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of these to the <hi>Curious,</hi> having not Room to Inlarge here, upon

            <p>
               <hi>Livy</hi> in his fifth Book tells us of a Winter so hard, That the River
<hi>Tyber</hi> was frozen over, a matter very strange in such a Climate as <hi>Italy.</hi>
In the year 1234 the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea was so frozen, that the <hi>Venetians</hi>
went over the <hi>Ice</hi> thereof with <hi>Carts. Zonaras</hi> assures us, that in the
Reign of that Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> (who for a Nasty Reason in his
Christning, was call'd <hi>Copronymus</hi>) about the year 750. the <hi>Pontick Sea,</hi> was
so Congealed, That people for many miles travelled it on foot: And
Horses and Carts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oaden, passed over the <hi>Fretum,</hi> or Narrow part of it; But
withal he adds, that the <hi>Summer following</hi> was so excessive <hi>hot and dry,</hi> that
great Rivers and most Fountains were wholly <hi>dryed up,</hi> and People and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56992:3"/>
Cattel perisht for want of water. In the year 821. the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>greatest Rivers
of <hi>Europe,</hi> as the <hi>Rhine,</hi> the <hi>Danubius,</hi> the <hi>Elb,</hi> and the <hi>Sein,</hi> were so
incrusted with Ice, that for the space of above 30 days, <hi>Carriages</hi> freely
passed along on them, as on the Land.</p>
            <p>But to look nearer home—In the year of our Lord 1365. and 49th
year of K. <hi>Edward</hi> the 3d, A <hi>Frost</hi> lasted from the midst of <hi>September</hi>
to the Month of <hi>April;</hi> but though so tedious, the Cold was nothing so
intense or violent as now. In the 15th year of the Reign of K. <hi>Henry</hi>
the Eighth, after great Rains and Winds, there followed so sore a
Frost, that many <hi>dyed for cold,</hi> and some lost <hi>Fingers,</hi> some <hi>Toes,</hi> and
many their <hi>Nails: [I follow the very words of Sir</hi> R. Baker, fol. 297.]
The same Author tells us, That in the seventh year of Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> on
the 21. of <hi>December,</hi> began <hi>a Frost</hi> so extream, that on <hi>New-Years-Day</hi>-Even
people passed over the Thames <hi>on foot,</hi> some plaid at <hi>Foot Ball,</hi> some
<hi>shot at Pricks,</hi> as if it had been firm ground; yet this great Frost, the third
of <hi>Ianuary</hi> at night, began to <hi>Thaw;</hi> and by the fifth day, there was no
Ice to be seen, but <hi>great Inundations</hi> followed.</p>
            <p>In the year 1609. [which 'tis not impossible, but some <hi>Living</hi> might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
being but 74 years ago] <hi>a Frost</hi> began in <hi>December,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
till <hi>April</hi> following, with such violence, that the Thames was
so frozen that <hi>Carts loaden,</hi> were frequently driven over it, most Fowls
and Birds were destroyed. In the year 1637. was another <hi>Frost,</hi> which
rendred the <hi>Thames</hi> passable; so in the year 1664 immediately follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the <hi>Great Sickness;</hi> And the like towards the latter end o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is the first Lesson in Wisdoms School. Therefore as we have been
studious in <hi>matter of Fact,</hi> past; but sparing as to Sequels; so we
shall retain the same becoming <hi>tenderness</hi> as to Futures; wherein we shall
steer our Course rather by the Guidance of <hi>Nature</hi> in her usual Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
here below, than by curious Researches into remoter <hi>influential
Causes above;</hi> though not neglecting them neither, For the <hi>Vniverse is
Intire, Harmonical,</hi> and <hi>Sympathetical,</hi> and he that does not competently
