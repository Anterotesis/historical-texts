            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <l>And rather on the very Spot Ile dye.</l>
                  <l>Thus Helliſhly reſolv'd, he does prepare</l>
                  <l>Straight to commence the bold and Impious War,</l>

And now the ſharp Encounter does begin</l>
                  <l>A Fight ſo fierce no eye had ever ſeen,</l>
                  <l>Nor ſhall hereafter ere behold agen.</l>
                  <l>But firſt be pleas'd to take a proſpect here,</l>
                  <l>Of the two Combatants as they appear:</l>
                  <l>The firſt a Perſon of Celeſtial Race,</l>
                  <l>Lovely his ſhape, ineffable his Face;</l>
                  <l>The frown with which he ſtruck the trembling Fiend</l>
                  <l>All ſmiles of humane Beauty did tranſcend:</l>
                  <l>His head's with Glory arm'd, and his ſtrong hand</l>
                  <l>No power of Earth or Hell can long withſtand.</l>
                  <l>He heads the mighty Hoſts in Heav'n above,</l>
                  <l>And all on Earth, who do <hi>Jehovah</hi> love.</l>
                  <l>His Camp's ſo great, they many millions are,</l>
                  <l>With whom no one for Courage may compare,</l>
                  <l>They are all choſen men, and cloath'd in white,</l>
                  <l>Ah! to behold them, what a lovely ſight</l>
                  <l>Is it! And yet more grave and lovely far</l>
                  <l>To joyn and make one in this Holy War.</l>
                  <l>The other was a King of Courage bold,</l>
                  <l>But very grim and ghaſtly to behold;</l>
                  <l>Great was his power, yet his garb did ſhow</l>
                  <l>Sad Symptoms of a former overthrow:</l>
                  <l>But now recruited with a numerous Train,</l>
                  <l>Arm'd with diſpair, he tempts his fate again.</l>
                  <l>Under his Banner the black Regiments fight,</l>
                  <l>And all the Wicked Troops which hate the light:</l>
                  <l>His Voluntiers are ſpread from North to South,</l>
                  <l>And flaming Sulphur belches from his Mouth.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:59945:19"/>
Such was the grand Importance of their ſight,</l>
                  <l>It did all eyes on Earth and Heaven invite</l>
                  <l>To be ſpectators, and attention lend:</l>
                  <l>So much did ne're on any Field depend;</l>
                  <l>No not <hi>Pharſalia's Plains,</hi> where <hi>Caeſar</hi> fought,</l>
                  <l>And the Worlds Empire at one conqueſt caught.</l>
                  <l>Alas, the Iſſue of that famous Fray,</l>
                  <l>May not compare with this more fatal Day.</l>

                  <l>Should the Black monſtrous Tyrant Prince prevail,</l>

                  <l>Twas for Her ſake alone the War begun.</l>
                  <l>Some fabulous Writers tell a wonderous ſtory,</l>

                  <l>From a ſtrange <hi>Dragon,</hi> by his Generous aid.</l>
                  <l>This I am ſure our bleſſed Captain fought</l>

                  <l>For her, who elſe had been devoured quite</l>
                  <l>By that Old <hi>Serpents</hi> ſubtility and ſpight.</l>
                  <l>But now tis time their Combate to diſplay</l>

                  <l>
                     <hi>Apollyon</hi> well ſtor'd with crafty wit</l>
                  <l>Long time had waited for a ſeaſon fit,</l>

                  <l>He flung at him a very cruel Dart,</l>
                  <l>And aym'd to hit him juſt upon the Heart.</l>
                  <l>He'd have him doubt or queſtion, if twere ſo?</l>

                  <l>But the bleſt Lord did uſe his Sword ſo well,</l>
                  <l>That down the others weapons ſtraight way fell:</l>
                  <l>It made him reel, and forc'd him back to ſtand,</l>

                  <p>Shewing what joy there was in Heaven amongſt the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
upon the great Victory obtained over the black
King. Shewing alſo how affectionately in a ſweet
heavenly manner, the Prince of light after this ſaluted
the Soul he came to ſave, for whoſe ſake he had
paſſed throw all theſe ſorrows. And how the ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
blind &amp; deluded wretch ſlighted and diſpiſed him
in her Heart; chooſing rather to hearken to, and ſide
with Apollyon, King of Darkneſs, and to entertain the
Monſter of pollution, ſenſual Luſts, than to become
a Spouſe to ſo glorious a Prince; pretending ſhe knew
him not, neither would ſhe believe he was the ſon of
God, the bleſſed and eternal Potentate; demanding
ſigns of him. Shewing upon this what ſtrange and
wonderful Miracles he wrought amongſt the people,
who notwithſtanding all, went about to kill him. And
how he was forc'd to fly from one Country to another,
to preſerve his life. And what hardſhips and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
he paſſed through, for love he bore to the poor
Creature.</p>

                  <p>Shewing how the people of that Land in a baſe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
uſed John the beloved ſervant of Jeſus, the
Prince of Light, who (for his Maſter's ſake) was
barbarouſly murthered; And how narrowly the
Prince himſelf eſcaped. As alſo ſhewing how he
again and again tendered his indeared love to
the Soul, and how unkindly ſhe denied his
Suit. Moreover, how Vicinius- (a Neighbor)
hearing of this great News, enquired of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logus
concerning the Creature this Prince in ſuch a
manner had ſet his affections upon. The miſerable
and deplorable condition of the Soul diſcovered and
laid open, being infected with a loathſome Diſeaſe full
of Vlcers and Running ſores from head to foot,
naked, wounded, and in her blood, her eyes alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
put out; and this the Prince knew before he came
from Heaven, his own Country: ſhewing, that as
ſhe was in her fallen ſtate, ſhe was the object of his
love and deſire.</p>
               </argument>
               <l>BEfore this Prince did in that Land appear,</l>
               <l>His ſervant came his way for to prepare.</l>
               <l>Such an Ambaſſadour he was indeed,</l>

               <l>As on this gracious Perſon to lay hold,</l>
               <l>And into a vile Priſon caſt is he,</l>
               <l>For witneſſing againſt Iniquity.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Herod</hi> would marry one moſt near of Kin,</l>
               <l>But <hi>John</hi> affirms that 'tis an horrid ſin.</l>
               <l>For him to have his Brother <hi>Philip</hi>'s Wife:</l>

               <l>The Prophet's head from's body they divide.</l>
               <l>This doubtleſs did his Maſter greatly grieve,</l>
               <l>To ſee they ſhould him thus of <hi>John</hi> bereave;</l>
               <l>His ſervant <hi>John,</hi> whom all the people own</l>
               <l>To be a Prophet, yea a mighty one;</l>
               <l>Though the chief work that he was ſent about,</l>
               <l>Was to deſcribe and point this Saviour out.</l>
               <l>He faithful was, and ſhow'd his conſtant Love,</l>
               <l>Told them his Prince deſcended from above:</l>

               <l>The loſs of ſuch a Servant needs muſt be</l>

                  <p>Shewing what Conſultations there were amongſt
the infernal Spirits to bring Jeſus, Prince of
Light, under the power of Death; a Council
called in Hell: the Princes of the fallen Angels in

Kingdom ſhould fall, and the poor Creature be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.
The grand Counſel of Old Satan is taken.
He enters into Judas. Judas's ſin diſcovered.
Jeſus is apprehended. A terrible battel, or Chriſt's
Agony before his Paſſion. Sin and Wrath combine
together: ſhewing the Prince's Conqueſts over them
both. Seven aggravations of Chriſt's ſorrows in the
Garden; and a Dialogue between the Devil, King
of Darkneſs, and Death, the King of Terrors.</p>
