            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

OR,
The unvailing of the oppoſers, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have ſeen great wickedneſſe under the title of a Word
for God: and in a paper called a Teſtimony on truths
behalf: I have ſeen many untruths. In former times, the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> covered and carried on all her filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and abominations under the name of holy Mother
the Church; and ſeeing now one Church will not do,
it is carried on under the name of divers Churches; and leſt that ſhould
fail and come ſhort, they adde divers Chriſtians. It hath been a true
proverb, In the name of God all evill begin: ſo the Mandates againſt the
Lollards. <hi>Richard</hi> by the grace of God, &amp;c. in behalf of holy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Church by the Kings authority cauſe <hi>William</hi> &amp;c. to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted
and ſent to us, that they with their pernicious doctrine do not
infect the people of God; ſo that the naming the Grace of God, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Mother, Church and people of God, then they were imboldened to
condemn and burn the people of God.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Powell</hi> and a few others do ſay that they have neither heart nor
hand to the preſent Government, is it not therefore neceſſary to
make it appear that they ought to have both their hearts and hands to
it, not only for wrath, but for conſcience ſake? and that Nature, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and the Word of God requireth the ſame; and that their oppoſing
the preſent Government and Governors is not without ſinning againſt
God and men, and that the cauſe of their diſſatisfaction is grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ignorance and miſtake, as is evident in the proof of theſe four par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
following (in which the Reaſons of their diſſatisfaction are
anſwered.)</p>
            <p>The firſt is, That there is no Reaſon to oppoſe or find fault with
the preſent Government.</p>
            <p>This is proved, firſt from the Government it ſelf.</p>
            <p>1. In that it is ſo ballanced and framed, that it provides for the
good of all, there being not any thing in it but that which is for the
liberty, ſafety, and welfare of the people. And,</p>
            <p>2. That whatſoever good may be done in any Government, may be
done in this.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:168362:3"/>
3. It is not poſſible for this Nation to enjoy more liberty, benefit,
and freedome in thing civil and religious then we do and may enjoy
in the preſent Government, as conſidered in the Inſtrument.</p>
            <p>1. For things civil we enjoy great peace and freedome, we quietly
ſit down under our own vines and eat the fruit thereof, and enjoy our
relations, &amp;c. That which ſome complain of is Exciſe and Taxes,
there is no cauſe to finde fault with the preſent Government for them,
ſeeing they were before this government had any being, and greater
then now, and in as much as this Nation is divided into parties, each
deſiring to ſuppreſſe the other, no one of them if they had the upper
hand could keep it without an Army, and an Army cannot be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
without Taxes, or Free-quarter or plunder, which is ten times
worſe; yet Mr. <hi>Powel</hi> and others call it but a pretence of neceſſity to
continue Taxes, &amp;c. And as things are, tell me what civil priviledge
can ye have more then ye have; and there are evident reaſons to make
it appear, that if the Kings party had the upper hand, there would be
a greater charge and tax upon the people then now there is; and if
the Taxes were more then they are, if neceſſity required them, there
were no reaſon to complain of the Government or his Highneſſe for
them, becauſe not his Highneſſe but the people reap the benefit of the
Taxes; alſo the preſent income by them is not enough to defray the
charge of the publick.</p>
            <p>2. For freedome in Religion it is ſo great it is even unſpeakable, for
under the preſent Government we enjoy more liberty then we have
enjoyed or have heard that ever any of this nation hath enjoyed ſince
it was a nation; we enjoy as much liberty as can be expected, as much
as can be given, as much as lawfully may be deſired, if that which is
expreſſed in the inſtrument of government be performed.</p>
            <p>1. Under this Government we may ſerve God according to our
underſtandings and conſciences, and be as holy and Religious as we
can be, we are not forced to be of the opinion and Religion that the
Magiſtrate is of, right or wrong, and to change when he changeth his, or
elſe be perſecuted; now men are not tempted to ſin or play the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
to avoid perſecution, now men are ready to ſhew what they are,
and if evil they may be avoided.</p>
            <p>2. Ye ſay ye are Chriſtians and have right to the things of Chriſt,
and who hinders ye of them? if ye would have liberty, protection,
countenance and aſſiſtance of the Magiſtrate, ye have it, what would
ye have more of the Magiſtrate for the advancement of Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome?</p>
            <p>3. This government maketh room and giveth place to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of Chriſt in the world, becauſe it medleth not with making
nor impoſing lawes formerly made in matters of Religion: therefore
it is a great miſtake to think this government doth oppoſe and hinder
the government of Chriſt, and untruly ſaid, that we were ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
times further from our liberty then afore, Mr. <hi>Powell</hi> ſaith
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:168362:3"/>
that we are deprived of our freedome more then in the daies of wicked
Kings, and that the bleſſed cauſe and noble principles are altogether laid
aſide: is not Religion a bleſſed cauſe, and is it not a noble principle to
deny the civill Magiſtrate a coer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ive power in matters meerly Religious?
and ſeeing the Magiſtrate owns this principle, how is it denied? if
you would have greater liberty then we enjoy, tell us what is that liberty
you would have; I know no liberty that is denied, except you would
have liberty to deſtroy us and your ſelves, where could ye expect ſo great
liberty as the people of God now enjoy, but in and by this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>4. There is no ground to beleeve that the people of this Nation would
ever have given us this freedome, or that any Parliament choſen by them
would ever give us this freedome, ſeeing the Miniſters and Magiſtrate,
cannot ſee that the bond betwixt Magiſtrate and people is eſſentially ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill:
I ſee therefore no way to enjoy this freedome but from God; in
this way therefore we ſhould as gladly accept of it as good newes from a
far countrey. In as much as,</p>
            <p>5. This Government preſerveth the lives of the Saints and others;
if our nation and other nations had had this government, the people of
God ſhould not have been ſo abuſed as they have been; they have been
greatly tortured and put to death, ſome put into a red hot Iron chair,
others torn with wilde horſes, ſome ſtarved, devoured of beaſts, caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
mines, beheaded, put into cold ponds all night in winter, a hundred
of them have died with cold and hunger upon a mountain in a night,
ſtripes, ſcourgings, ſtonings, plates of Iron burning hot, dungeons, wracks,
ſtranglings, priſons, teeth of beaſts, gridirons, gibbets, gallowes, toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
upon horns of buls, drowning, whipt, roaſted, hanged, burnt,
choaked, putting out their eyes, ſawn aſunder, and crucified, and many
other tortures, one of which one would not chuſe to ſuffer for a world
though all that can be inflicted are not to be refuſed for Chriſt: in one
day two thouſand Chriſtians have been put to death, and ſeventeen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
in one moneth, ſixteen thouſand were martyred in <hi>Perſia,</hi> two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
burned together in a Church in <hi>Arabia,</hi> 6666 ſouldiers ſuffered for
Chriſt, and in <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Britain,</hi> rivers have been coloured with
the bloud of Chriſtians; all the Apoſtles of Jeſus Chriſt were put to
death, except <hi>John,</hi> he was baniſhed to <hi>Patmus,</hi> and put into a tun of
ſcolding oyle yet did live: the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> the ſon of <hi>Zebede</hi> marty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<hi>James</hi> the ſon of <hi>Alpheus</hi> ſtoned, <hi>James</hi> the brother of our Lord
ſtoned to death, <hi>Bartholomew</hi> beheaded, <hi>Matthias</hi> ſtoned and beheaded,
<hi>Thomas</hi> ſlain with a dart, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Andrew</hi> were crucified, <hi>Matthew</hi>
martyred with a ſpear, <hi>Philip</hi> crucified and ſtoned, <hi>Mark</hi> burned, <hi>Paul</hi>
beheaded under <hi>Nero, Peter</hi> ſtoned, <hi>Simon</hi> Zelot crucified in <hi>Britain,</hi> and all
for Religion, three Papiſts and three Proteſtants died in Smithfield in one
day in <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. daies, they were carried thither two upon a hurdle, one
a Papiſt and one a Proteſtant: if we eſteem not freedome from theſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
a great mercy, our eyes are blinded and our hearts are hardned: we
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:168362:4"/>
need to remember and conſider theſe things, that we may know what
we enjoy, and that this preſent Government prevents theſe miſeries, and
therefore God doth know that I do believe the preſent Government is
the moſt excellent and bleſſed civil Government that ever <hi>England</hi> did
enjoy; therefore I ſay in anſwer to Mr. <hi>Powell,</hi> it's evident they were
well adviſed that framed and accepted it, and there was ſufficient cauſe to
warrant the alteration of the former; this Government is worth as much
as our lives are worth, What good will all this world do me if I am to be
hanged for an Heretick? the beſt of the people of God have in all ages been
eſteemed and called ſo; freedome from corporal puniſhments in matters
meerly religious, is one of the greateſt outward bleſſings we can enjoy.</p>
            <p>6. This Government in the inſtrument provides to make ſure this
bleſſed liberty, for the future that no Parliament ſhall meddle with this
our liberty, without which we ſhould have been at a great uncertainty; for
if one Parliament or Governour had given us this freedome, the next
might have ſtripped us of it, and ſo have put us or ours into as bad a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
as ever we were under the Biſhops tyranny.</p>
            <p>7. This liberty in Religion preſerves the lives of men in preventing wars,
for the moſt of the wars in the world have been occaſioned for Religion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We have the teſtimony of many that were unſatisfied, that now
upon further conſideration do witneſſe with us, that there is no reaſon to
oppoſe the Government; &amp; ſome that are not ſatisfied have wearied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and ſee they can do no good of it, reſolve to be quiet and to minde
their own buſineſſe, ſo that the oppoſition doth not increaſe but decreaſe,
and the ſtrength of oppoſers groweth weaker and weaker.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The words and actions of the greateſt oppoſers of the preſent
Government, declare that they want a reaſon for their oppoſing it.</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe they finde fault and expreſſe great diſlike, but do not ſhew
us a Reaſon, if they had any, ſure they would let us ſee it.</p>
            <p>2. Becauſe they have had ſeveral meetings in private with themſelves,
and they cannot agree what to have, if they could have their own deſires;
by which it appears they are to ſeek of a reaſon of their oppoſition; if
it were not ſo, they would ſhew reaſon againſt that they oppoſe, and ſhew
a more excellent way with reaſons to prove it ſo, which they have not done
nor can do.</p>
            <p>3. Becauſe they ſhun and refuſe to examine and debate the difference
with us when deſired, which ſhewes they are not provided with a Reaſon
for their practiſe, as thoſe that have not ſtudied the point: and alſo it
ſhewes that their oppoſition is not from a greater light, but from diſcontent,
being diſappointed and croſſed, they complain and beget complainers that
complain at they know not what.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Their words want reaſon, to ſay a man do not do all he
ſhould, therefore the government is unlawfull, or he doth ſomethings amiſſe
therefore he is no lawfull Governour; if there is reaſon in this reaſoning,
it is above my Reaſon.</p>
            <p>If I promiſe to pay a ſum of money in ſilver and I pay it in gold, is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:168362:4"/>
there any reaſon to call me deceiver and to charge me of breach of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
covenants and ingagements; it will appear the cauſe in difference is
ſo, and that this Government is a fulfilling of their promiſes, and in that
way or in a better.</p>
            <p>Is there any reaſon to charge his Highneſſe with having the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in one ſingle perſon contrary to promiſe, when there is no ſuch thing,
for the Government in the Inſtrument is in three eſtates, and if it were
only in him and his Councel, they are more then one ſingle perſon.</p>
            <p>Is there any reaſon to finde fault with the title of Protector, ſeeing
the word <hi>Saviours</hi> is as great, and the word <hi>Gods</hi> is greater, <hi>I ſaid ye are
gods,</hi> Pſal. 82. 6. I did not think it lawfull to give the title of Protector
to any man, and ſo I ſaid to his Highneſſe, and therefore I left out that
word in my late apologie: ſince I did ſee that my ignorance was the cauſe
of that miſtake, and the former place and Mr. <hi>John Mores</hi> obſervation on
Neh. 9. 27. did ſatisfie me, and may ſatisfie any in this doubt.</p>
            <p>Is there any reaſon to beleeve that thoſe very few who oppoſe the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
have a greater light or more love or zeal to God or man, then
thoſe many that fear God in this nation, that own and ſubmit unto the
preſent Government and Governors?</p>
            <p>Are they like to prevail or to do any good, that can make it no way to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
that they have any call either from God or man, Scripture or Reaſon,
nor can agree among themſelves what to have, though they may ſign a
paper without knowing what it is.</p>
            <p>There is no reaſon to deſire to alter or change the Government unleſſe
it were for a better; we have not a better; if they have, we deſire they
would let us ſee it; they cry Crucifie this Government, we cry, What
evill hath it done? they cry, Crucifie it, crucifie it, we deſire to know what
we ſhall have in ſtead thereof: they ſay; Down with this and truſt God
what we ſhall have; if we ſhould counſel them to make away all their
eſtates, and truſt God what they ſhall have for themſelves, do you think
they would do it? do they think that thoſe in authority or any man in
his wits are ſo fooliſh to caſt away this Government before they know
how to have a better?</p>
            <p>There is no reaſon to alter this Government, becauſe if the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſhould be altered and changed as they deſire, it would either be to
no purpoſe, or elſe be for the worſe, and tend to our ruine, and to deſtroy
that which God hath built up; for if it ſhould be put into the hands of
another or more, if he or they be of the ſame minde the preſent Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
are of, then although the perſons are not the ſame, our condition
will be the ſame; and if they be of other judgements and affections, where
are we then but in a condition of ruine and deſtruction? I wiſh from my
heart that we could ſee when we are well, and that we could more bleſſe
and praiſe the God of heaven that we are ſo well as we are.</p>
            <p>5. They that oppoſe the preſent Government call us that are for it
apoſtates, flatterers, ſelf-ended time-ſervers; we anſwer, our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
was called Beelzebub the ſervant is not above his Lord. But firſt,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:168362:5"/>
is there any ſtrength or reaſon in ſuch language to convince us? So they
condemn my Apologie and me for it, but they ſhew me not wherein I
have erred, all the anſwer I can get Mr <hi>Spitlehouſe</hi> ſaith I am <hi>Elymas,</hi>
that ſatisfieth me that they can give me no better anſwer; he gave a
fuller anſwer, that ſaid he had anſwered and confuted <hi>Bellarmin</hi> by telling
him that be lied; ſo in ſtead of their bringing forth their ſtrong Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
as Iſa. 41. 21. to bring forth ſtrong railing and lying like mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murers
and complainers ſpeak great ſwelling words, Jud. 16. 8. that make
a great noiſe, pride, pomp, luxury, laſciviouſneſſe, &amp;c. but not mention
wherein and prove it is ſo, I think the Engliſh of it is that they will tell us
in particulars wherein when they know.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is, That there is not any Scripture that doth juſtifie their
oppoſing the preſent Government.</p>
            <p>This is proved, 1. Becauſe the Word of God doth not condemn any
form of civil government, therefore it condemns not this; there is no form
of civil government in Chriſts Teſtament, requiring all nations to obſerve
the ſame, let thoſe that ſay otherwiſe ſhew us if they can in Chriſts Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament
the form of civil government they would have.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Powell</hi> ſaith this government is not according to Gods Word; if
ſo, then the Word of God is againſt it expreſt, or by conſequence expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it is not; if they ſay it is by conſequence, we deſire to ſee thoſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
from whence thoſe conſequences are drawn: for the late Biſhops did
affirm, that the Altar, Croſſe and Surplice was commanded in Scripture,
to prove it they alledged 1 Cor. 14. 40. <hi>Let ull things be done decently and
in order;</hi> we ſaid we could ſee no Altar, Croſſe, Surpliſſe in that Text;
they replyed they were there by conſequence; ſuch conſequence it's like
they have againſt this government, and as well carried to the text, not
fetched from it.</p>
            <p>2. Becauſe Mr. <hi>Powell</hi> and others that oppoſe the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
do not profeſs to have any word of Scripture for their ſo doing. For,</p>
            <p>1. Mr. <hi>Powell</hi> &amp;c. ſaith they have waited to ſee if God by his provi-might
might alter our mindes; ſo that it's evident their oppoſition was
not grounded upon the Word of God; if it were, they ſhould not need
have waited to ſee if God would alter their mindes.</p>
            <p>2. They ſay, we hope God hath directed us; they ſay not, we are ſure,
nor that the Word of God is againſt it; the hopes of many have failed,
they ſhould to the law and to the teſtimony, and be aſhamed to maintain
any thing that is uncertain and doubtfull, and to teach any thing that
they cannot finde in the word of God.</p>
            <p>3. They alſo alledge that the words and acts of men are againſt
this Goveenment; ſo that it appears they cannot ſay the words and acts
of God are againſt it. So,</p>
            <p>4. They alledge for their oppoſing the government, We finde in our
conſciences, if they could have found any thing in the Word of God
againſt it, we ſhould have heard of it in both ears: many and grievous
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:168362:5"/>
evils have ben ſeen in the conſciences of many; I would know of them
that in as much as the word of God doth not condemn this Government,
how comes is to paſſe that their conſciences are offended at it, ſeeing not
any thing can binde conſcience but the Word of God, that only being
the ground and rule of conſcience, How readeſt thou? all moral perſons
have a wicked conſcience full of ſcrupuloſity; no one ſhould be offended
at any thing, untill they can ſay the Word of God doth condemn it;
therefore I condemn it, and it offends me; and if this rule be obſerved,
there will not be any offended at the preſent Government. So they,</p>
            <p>5. Alledge their reall apprehenſions: what are they but reall miſtakes
that flow from ignorance and paſſion?</p>
            <p>6. So they alledge to juſtifie their oppoſition many Churches and
names of beleevers as they ſay, which were needleſſe to do if they had the
Word of God to charge us with, that alone were ſufficient. Alſo,</p>
            <p>7. They call it their Teſtimony, and well they may, becauſe it is
none of Gods.</p>
            <p>As for the names ye mention (and ſay ye might have had more
names: why did ye not take them, though they are to no purpoſe?) I
have looked over all the names, <hi>William Jones,</hi> and <hi>John Morgan,</hi> &amp;c.
and can ſee neither Scripture nor Reaſon in them to prove that which ye
deſire; and whereas ye ſay your paper might have come ſooner to our
hands, but &amp;c. it is come ſoon enough; and it had been more for your
credit, if it had not come at all.</p>
            <p>They might have alledged for their oppoſition of this Government, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Their dreams againſt it, which were the workings of their ſpirits
when their bodies were aſleep; and of that which a man would have to
be, he dreams it is; ſo he that was a hungry dreamed he did eat, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, The luſtings of their ſpirits to envy:</hi> Do you think the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
ſaith in vain, The ſpirit that dwelleth in us luſteth to envy, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 5.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The viſions (not of God, but) of their own hearts.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Their unquiet natures cannot skill of peace.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Want of conſideration of, and thankfulneſſe for the many and
great mercies we enjoy, and want of faith and patience to wait Gods
time for the reſt.</p>
            <p>The third is, That the Word of God is for the preſent Government and
Governors, and requireth us to own it and them, and to be ſubject to
them.</p>
            <p>This is proved 1. Becauſe <hi>there is no power but of God: The powers that
be, are of God,</hi> Rom. 13. 1. there is no civill power in theſe three Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
above this, therefore this is the higher power which we are to
own and be ſubject unto the preſent Government is a power, and
therefore of God; therefore they ſaid untrue it was not of God, nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Word: <hi>He that reſiſteth the power reſiſteth the ordinance of
God, and they that reſiſt ſhall receive to themſelves damnation,</hi> Rom. 13. 2.
The Scripture condemns them <hi>that deſpiſe Government,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 10. Jud. 8.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:168362:6"/>
2. <hi>The battle is not to the ſtrong,</hi> Eccleſ. 9. 11. therefore they ſay not
true that ſay <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> ſet up himſelf by policy and ſtrength of the
Army.</p>
            <p>3. The Scripture ſaith God doth it, <hi>he ſetteth up whom he will,</hi> Luk.
1. 52. Dan. 4. 27. Prov. 8. 16. Jer. 10. 23. If a ſparrow fall to the ground,
it is not without your Father, then much more is not this Government
without your Father; <hi>for by ſtrength ſhall no man prevail,</hi> 1 Sam. 2. 9.
7. 8. It is a branch of flattery to aſcribe the doing of thoſe things to
man, which he never did nor can do, and is idolatry to give that to
Man which is proper only to God. Man would have hindred this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
but could not, God could but would not; therefore he willed it and
cauſed it to be: <hi>Many devices are in mens hearts, yet the counſell of the Lord
ſhall ſtand,</hi> Prov. 19. 21. If God had not willed it, it could not have been,
for <hi>God worketh all things after the counſel of his own will,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 11.
therefore all things that do happen, do come abſolutely and of neceſſity;
that which cometh even, by providence, cometh by the order and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
of God, Act. 2. 23. &amp; 4. 28. and hath more in it then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
            <p>4. The Lord ſaith, in the laſt daies, <hi>viz</hi> the daies of the Goſpel, Iſa. 2. 2.
<hi>I will reſtore thy Judges as at firſt,</hi> Iſa. 1. 26. how that was, ſee Judg.
2. 16, 18 that man the Lord raiſed up and was with, ſo as to make a
chief inſtrument in delivering his people from their enemies; the
Lord made that man their judge and counſellor, ſo was <hi>Gideon</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bora,</hi>
&amp;c. the Lord hath raiſed up <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> and hath been won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
with him, and made him a chief inſtrument in delivering us from
our enemies in <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and God hath ſet him up
and made him chief Governour over theſe three Nations; therefore he
is a Judge and Counſellor as at the firſt, and is a fulfilling of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.
One of the oppoſers ſaid, that there was but three waies to come
to government, Election of people, Birth, and Conqueſt; it is evident
there is a fourth, which is beſt of all, and that is Gods choice; ſo <hi>Moſes</hi>
was made a ruler by God over Iſrael, or not ſo at all; if he had been
made ſo by the people they would never have ſaid to him as ſome ſaid
then as now, <hi>ye take too much upon you,</hi> who made thee a <hi>Ruler and Judge
over us?</hi> Act. 7. 27. 35. which is in effect as much as to ſay, ye are very
willing and forward to ſet up your ſelf (God perſwades <hi>Japhet</hi> to dwell
in the tents of <hi>Shem</hi>) ye take it, <hi>viz.</hi> it was not given you; too much, <hi>viz.</hi>
its more then comes to your ſhare, we know no call ye have to that place:
it ſeems they thought he had no call unleſſe he had their call, and was
of their making, becauſe they ſaw not God in it; they eyed to ſee how
much there was of man in it, and finding nothing of ſelf in it, rejected
him: the leſſe of man, the more of God; God never hath much glory
in thoſe things in which there is much of man: it is a ſure rule where
any great thing is effected, and there is little or nothing of man in it,
there is much of God in thoſe things, and in them God is more ſeen, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
and honoured: all the works of God are by con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>raries.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:168362:6"/>
5. God hath owned the preſent Government and Governours, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we ſhould own them and not oppoſe them: the event ſheweth
which ſide God is of, for <hi>they ſhall fight againſt thee, but they ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
againſt thee; for I am with thee, ſaith the Lord, to deliver thee,</hi> Ier. 1. 19.
Some have laid down their Commiſſions, ſeveral have condemned Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and Governors, and curſed them, ſome have preached againſt
them, and written againſt them, and called to God againſt it and them,
many have conſulted and plotted againſt them, tumults have been ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
together, and armed men have riſen in ſeveral places in one time,
notwithſtanding it ſtands and they againſt all oppoſition, no weapon
formed againſt it proſpers, God hath wholly withdrawn himſelf from
their prayers as againſt the Government and Governors, the enemies are
diſappointed and confounded; God is Lord of Hoſts, he <hi>by his ſtrength
ſtilleth the tumults of the people,</hi> Pſal. 65 6, 7. <hi>He ſetteth the bounds of the
people,</hi> Deut. 32. 8. beyond which they cannot paſſe: ſo the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and Governors, and we, are preſerved, bleſſed be God for the
ſame.</p>
            <p>Therefore Mr. <hi>Powell</hi> ſaid not true in ſaying that this Government is
not of Gods approbation; but it's but his ſay ſo, becauſe he doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
neither Scripture nor Reaſon to prove it ſo: one ſpeaking of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
was required to prove by Scripture that he ſaid; anſwered, I
ſay it, as if it were enough that he ſaid ſo; we muſt take that or nothing
where no more is to be had; ſo here it ſeems they think their ſay ſo is
enough to confirm their conceited ſelf-willed and ignorant affirmations in
which they abound in.</p>
            <p>6. Gods approbation of this Government and Governours hath appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
in that the ſouldiers have owned it, the Emperors have been choſen
by the ſouldiers.</p>
            <p>7. The Government and Governers hath been owned by God and man
in that it hath been conſented unto, not only by the greateſt and moſt
conſiderable perſons in this Nation, but alſo by the people in generall,
by their owning him, and their obedience to him and the Government;
what is all this but Gods owning the Government and Governors?</p>
            <p>God hath teſtified his owning them, and we are to follow the Lord
which way ſoever he goeth; therefore we are to own them and aſſiſt them
with our perſons and eſtates, leſt we ſin and ſuffer for it, as the Citizens
of that great City of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> did, who refuſed to part with ſo much
money as was neceſſary to oppoſe their enemies, though they were
beſought with tears to do it, they would not, neither freely nor by force,
they ſtood for the priviledge of the ſubject; it was not their priviledge to
keep that money that the publick ſtood in need of though they thought
ſo; it was their ruine there, not parting with ſome of their eſtates, they
loſt that goodly City, and loſt all their money and treaſure, and their
lives alſo; the enemy ſeeing ſo great treaſure and ſupply wondred at
their folly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:168362:7"/>
The fourth is, That the holy Scriptures are againſt the oppoſition that
is made againſt the preſent Government and Governors.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is proved, 1. Becauſe the Scripture ſaith,</hi> Put them in minde to be
ſubject to principalities and powers, to obey Magiſtrates, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 1, 2. In
reſiſting the powers they reſiſt the ordinance of God; and they that reſiſt ſhall
receive to themſelves damnation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> If ſo, then ye ſinned in reſiſting the late King, and ſo reſiſted the
ordinance of God.</p>
            <p>1. To this I anſwer three things, the firſt is, That our reſiſtance was
but a defenſive war, which a King of <hi>England</hi> approved of when
againſt himſelf. See <hi>Acts Monuments Church 3 book end pag.</hi> 74.</p>
            <p>2. Alſo the late King in beginning the war, became guilty of all the
bloud ſhed in it; if that had been all, there was ſufficient cauſe for that
to cut him off.</p>
            <p>3. Alſo the King was one with Antichriſt, againſt whom we are
commanded to make war.</p>
            <p>2. The oppoſers of the preſent Government, &amp;c. ſin in that they do
not ſeek the peace of the Nation, but in ſtead thereof they diſturb and
indanger the peace of it; for if they who were in <hi>captivity</hi> in a ſtrange land
were <hi>to pray and ſeek the peace of that place,</hi> Jer. 29. 7. then much more
ought the oppoſers and we to ſeek and pray for the peace of our native
Countrey, where we are not captives, but enjoy very great liberties and
priviledges: and that which is my duty to do, I may promiſe to my power
to do; and if I ſeek not the peace of the place I ſin: the oppoſers are ſo
far from ſeeking the peace of it, that they are not willing that others ſeek
it, that they ſhoot their ſharp arrowes, bitter words at thoſe that oppoſe
their oppoſition.</p>
            <p>3. The oppoſers ſin in that they neglect to own the work God is a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in this generation, which is a part of that generation work appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for us to do: ſome that now oppoſe have owned Gods work, and now
appear to leave following the Lord, and ceaſe owning the work God is
now a doing, and ſeek what in them lies to hinder God and man in
that work.</p>
            <p>4. The oppoſers ſin, becauſe in ſo doing ye nouriſh the works of
the fleſh, which ye ſhould mortifie and crucifie; <hi>The works of the fleſh are
manifeſt,</hi> in their oppoſition, <hi>hatred, variance, emulation, wrath, ſtrife,
ſeditions,</hi> Gal. 5. 19, 20. One of them ſaid in the pulpit, he wondred wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
could lye ſo quietly by their husbands and not provoke them, &amp;c,
which tended to the deſtruction of humane ſociety: Is this to preach Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt and him crucified, or rather is that preaching that crucifie
Chriſt? They alſo ſhew us what lieth in the bottome of their hearts, we
ſee like end like means, all is nought, God is not with you herein, to you
it is not given; what ye extraordinarily inſinuate God with us and
gards of Angels, do ye think God will not take care of his great name?
will God leave his people and bring to nothing the many and great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances
he hath given us? He that hath begun our enemies ruine, will if
they repent not make an end, Pſal. 140. 4, 8.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:168362:7"/>
5. They ſin in that they ſay againſt his Highneſſe whether it be true or
falſe; if it be true, ye <hi>uncover your fathers nakedneſſe,</hi> this God condemns
Ezek. 22. 10 <hi>He was curſed that ſaw his fathers nakedneſſe and told it, and
he bleſſed that covered it,</hi> Gen. 21. 22, 23, 26, 27.</p>
            <p>6. Ye ſin in that ye act contrary to the Word of the Lord, Mat. 18. 15.
but in ſtead thereof ye rail like mad men, for ſo ye are judged to be by
many that hear you.</p>
            <p>7. Ye ſin in that ye ſpeak and affirm many things which are untrue to
carry on your deſign, and to make the Government and thoſe in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and us odious.</p>
            <p>1. Ye ſay ye are perſecuted for Chriſt and for Religion, this I have
proved falſe in my late Apologie, and that in ſo ſaying ye perſecute his
Highneſſe, as Gal. 3. 29, 30. Act. 22. 14. &amp; 9. 4. &amp; 5. 1. Mr. <hi>Feak</hi>
ſaith the words of his Mittimus are to commit &amp;c. in order to the peace
and ſafety of the Nation, by which it appears it is not for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>2. So they ſay that the Saints are committed for their conſciences: this
is untrue, for they are impriſoned for their words, that oppoſe the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Government and Governors, is a thing of great concernment, and
indangering the civil peace, to deny the authority under which we live;
to oppoſe the Government and civill Magiſtrate cauſeth debate, debate
cauſeth a difference, difference cauſeth diviſions and ſidings of parties,
ſidings of parties cauſeth envie and jealouſies, and condemning of each

               </gap>tion. The offence ſome of them
commit tends to this, every Governor is bound by the law of nature to
uſe the means to preſerve the peace and welfare of the people: ſome of
their words that oppoſe the Government, &amp;c. ſtrike at both, and it were
a great ſin in thoſe in authority to ſuffer it; if the good man of the
houſe will not ſuffer his houſe to be digged through, much leſſe is their
practiſe to be ſuffered; if a good man do ill, it is ſo much the worſe;
for ſo much as he is in eſteem or eminent for knowledge or goodneſſe, ſo
much the more evill and dangerous and taking is the evill that he doth;
and ſo much the more care and means is to be uſed to prevent the ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of that evil, and ſo much the greater puniſhment he deſerves that
commits the evill, ſaints are to be under the temporall ſword. His High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
hath ſhewed great love, patience and forbearance to thoſe that oppoſe
and abuſe him, and indanger all, untill there appear no remedy or hope
of gaining them, nor that they will be quiet, and even then he dealeth
friendly with them in that they are only ſecured and not put to no tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and that to prevent further danger, for that man that hath ſpoken
moſt againſt him and much abuſed him, &amp;c. though he ſhould not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
his fault in ſo doing, yet if he ſtould promiſe to be quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:168362:8"/>
for the future, he would freely forgive him and quickly ſet him at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
which ſheweth that all that is aimed at is the preſervation of the
peace and ſafety of the people, this is no hard meaſure, yet for this he
is blamed, if they ſay they deteſt the impriſonment of the Saints, they
plead it is their conſcience to oppoſe &amp;c. and their teſtimony, but that is
no argument to exempt any from puniſhment, if it were, there ſhould
no one be puniſhed for any fault whatſoever, though it were inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
adultery and murder, that is ſome mens conſcience and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
            <p>3. So they ſay men are committed for they know not what: this is
alſo untrue, they and others know it is for ſpeaking and indangering the
civill peace, or for not promiſing to be peaceable. So Mr. <hi>Powell</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
becauſe they are not brought to their trial, it's well for ſome of
them they are not brought to their triall, if they ſhould they might ſuffer:
the Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> petitioned to be brought to his triall, they
granted his Petition, and cut off his head, but not without cauſe.</p>
            <p>4. One of them ſaid, that day the Government was proclaimed, that
it ſhould not continue a year, ye ſee it hath continued longer, therefore
it was from a lying ſpirit, or at beſt from a miſtake, yet he will go on in
oppoſing it.</p>
            <p>5. They ſay the Army fought againſt the late King becauſe he was
King, if they did ſo, they did ill, but I do not beleeve they were ſo ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
if the being a King is unlawfull, why are we required to pray for
Kings? why ſhould Chriſt and Saints be Kings? he hath made us
Kings, Rev. 5. 10. I was never againſt Kingly government, but againſt
their coerſive power in matters meerly religious.</p>
            <p>6. They ſay the King loſt his life becauſe he was King: no, it
was for beginning the war, and the guilt of the bloud ſhed in it, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>7. Mr. <hi>Powell</hi> ſaith we build again what before we deſtroyed: this
is alſo untrue, for they have deſtroyed corporall puniſhments in matters
religious, and that is not built again; alſo I know ſome call the triets
Antichriſtian, but I do not ſee them prove it.</p>
            <p>So they ſay it was but a pretended neceſſity, for the doing that his
Highneſſe hath done. So they might ſay of <hi>David</hi> eating the ſhew-bread,
Mat. 12. So ſome of them had a hand in breaking up the firſt Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
I aske them if they oppoſed the Parliament upon a pretended ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity?
there is ground to beleeve he would not have done ſome things
that he hath done, if abſolute neceſſity of preventing evill and danger
had not occaſioned it: how can they judge of the greatneſſe of the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
that are ignorant of the deſigners their deſigns, their cauſes and
their circumſtances and tendencies? Surely thoſe who frequently judge
of the meaſure of the neceſſity and ſo judge unwiſely and unjuſtly of the
neceſſity, and cenſure and condemn others.</p>
            <p>9. Mr. <hi>Powell</hi> ſaith, theſe men who now build what they did once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy,
and juſtifie what they did once condemn; witneſſe their own wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
particularly the Declaration of the Officers and Souldiers of the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:168362:8"/>
Engliſh Army, <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1. 1650. pag. 7. 12. whereof the Lord <hi>Cro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>well</hi>
was Generall, the words whereof are as followeth: <q>We are perſwaded
in our conſciences, that the late King and his Monarchy was one of
the ten hornes of the beaſt ſpoken of Rev. 17. 13, 14, 15. and that we
were called forth by the Lord to be inſtrumental to bring about
that which was our continuall prayer unto God, <hi>viz.</hi> the deſtruction of
Antichriſt and the deliverance of his Church and people; and upon
this ſingle account we ingaged not knowing the deep policies of worldly
ſtates-men, and have ever ſince hazarded our lives in the high places
in the field (where we have ſeen many wonders of the Lord) againſt
all the oppoſers of the work of Jeſus Chriſt, whom we have all along
ſeen going with us and making our way plain before us, and having
theſe things ſingly in our eye, namely the deſtruction of Antichriſt, the
advancement of the Kingdome of Chriſt, the deliverance of his
Church, and the eſtabliſhment thereof in the uſe of his Ordinances in
purity according to his Word, and the juſt civill liberties of Engliſh
men.</q>
            </p>
            <p>1. Obſerve, It ſaith the late King was one of the ten horns of the beaſt,
not as he was King, nor as he was chief Governor, but becauſe he gave
his power, <hi>viz.</hi> his horn, his ſtrength, to the beaſt, (the falſe Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> may be called a beaſt for her beaſtlineſſe) the Lord Biſhops and
Popes Prieſthood, and ſo became one with Antichriſt of whom they were:
the late King and his Monarchy was a mixt power Civill and Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall
together, he aſſume the title of Defender of the Faith, (which the
Pope gave to <hi>Henry</hi> 8. King of <hi>England</hi>) Supreme in all cauſes Civill and
Eccleſiaſticall head of the Church, and ſo aſſumed the name and office of
Jeſus Chriſt to be a law-giver in matters of Religion; for what the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
did herein, was by and under his authority; all which is proper on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to Jeſus Chriſt, he is the head of his Church, Col. 1. 18. Epheſ.
4. 15. he is the only Law-giver in matters of Religion, Jam. 1. 12.
therefore it is blaſphemy to give the titles of Ieſus Chriſt to the King;
therefore it is ſaid the names of blaſphemy was upon the head of the
beaſt.</p>
            <p>2. With his horn, <hi>viz.</hi> power, the late King puſhed and goared the
people of God, perſecuted the Saints for not yeelding ſubjection to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts
lawes; he had an impoſing ſpirit in matter of Religion, which is
the ſpirit of Antichriſt: and ſuch a King and Monarchy is not ſet up, nor
deſired.</p>
            <p>3. They declare Gods call to endevour the deſtruction of Antichriſt:
and this they have done in part in deſtroying him and that wicked Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
God requireth his people to make war with Babylon, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,
the army of the Dragon, to ſhoot at her ſpare no arrowes, Ier. 50. 14.
God ordaineth his arrowes againſt the perſecuters, Pſal. 7. 13. they that
are with the Lamb, Rev. 14. 1. are to make war with the Dragon and
his army; and there is great joy in the army of the Lamb, to
wound a chief officer, as a Major Generall as the late King was in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:168362:9"/>
the army of the dragon, and I ſaw him wounded and fell, I ſhouted for
joy.</p>
            <p>4. It ſaith that they ſought the deſtruction of Antichriſt: this they
have done (as for the outward part of it in <hi>England</hi>) in ſeparating Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
power, and excluding the Eccleſiaſticall.</p>
            <p>5. It ſaith, they ſought the deliverance of the Church and people of
God: this is effected in that they have done, and in delivering us
from the late Kings party or others that ſeek our ruine.</p>
            <p>6. It ſaith, they ſought the advancement of the Kingdome of Chriſt:
now it's advanced indeed above all things in the world, and as highly
advanced as the Magiſtrate can advance it, in that the Magiſtrate is not
ſet above it, nor have they ſet any thing elſe above it; men have liberty
to preach and print, pray and practiſe whatſoever makes for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thereof, there is none to hinder them.</p>
            <p>7. It ſaith, they ſought to eſtabliſh the Church in uſe of ordinances in
purity according to the word of God: this is effected in freeing the
Church from mens humane inventions in Gods worſhip.</p>
            <p>8. It ſaith, the deſtruction of Antichriſt was ſingly in their eye when
they engaged: then it appears it was not in their eye to deſtroy Kingly
Government, alſo they did not ingage againſt any other form of civill Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
or the being of any chief Governour that was only civill, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if they had ſet up a King with civill power, it had been no breach of
this engagement.</p>
            <p>9. They ſay they did not know the deep policies of men; I deſire
they may know them ſo as to prevent them, and whatſoever policy or any
thing elſe in any man or men, that is not for the glory of God and the
good of theſe Nations: the Lord in mercy confound and deſtroy all ſuch
policies and deſigns; and to this I beleeve his Highneſſe &amp;c. is willing to
ſay Amen.</p>
            <p>10. It ſaith, they ingaged for the juſt liberties of Engliſh men: this
is done in part, and is a doing and will be done in Gods time and way.
therefore they have not broke their ingagement; and if this ingagement
had not been cited, I ſhould not have been ſo fully ſatisfied of their
keeping of it as now I am, and I appeal to any that are ſober and wiſe,
whether this Government or any thing that is ſet up by thoſe in authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
is a breach of this engagement, and yet this ingagement is culled out
from the reſt as a witneſſe againſt them; ſo that it ſeems, if this be kept,
all is kept: and ſeeing this their proof faileth, which they call their wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
therefore their ſaying that his Highneſſe hath built what he deſtroyed,
and juſtifie what he did once condemn, and that they have been fighters
againſt the things they now practiſe, are all untruths.</p>
            <p>11. Mr. <hi>Powell</hi> ſpeaking of his Highneſſe, ſaith pride, luxury, laſcivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
changing of principles, forſaking the good waies, juſtice and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
are to be read in your forehead: was there ever the like ſeen to
caſt out ſo many great charges at once and alledge nothing in the world
to prove them, only a bare ſaying that they are to be ſeen in his forehead,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:168362:9"/>
I looked in his forehead and I ſaw no ſuch, things; but it may be they
mean it is to be ſeen in his title of Protector; if that be their meaning,
that is very untrue, his title of Protector being lawfull, as is above pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
is no proof of it; I cannot finde in Scripture that ever any of Chriſts
Diſciples, much leſſe Miniſters gave ſuch language.</p>
            <p>12. Mr. <hi>Powell</hi> ſaith, the bleſſed cauſe and noble principles are now
laid aſide, and another cauſe and intereſt contrary to it is eſpouſed: this is
alſo untrue: and whereas ye ſay it is ſo as ye conceive; it appears ye have
no ground to ſay ſo, neither from Scripture nor Reaſon, nor any experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
but a bare conceit, <hi>viz.</hi> a meer evill imagination of the vanity of
their mindes.</p>
            <p>13. Ye ſay the Government overthrew the very foundation of a
Common-wealth: this is untrue, for it is the only way and foundation of
a Common-weal, and good of all, having equall liberty.</p>
            <p>14. Mr. <hi>Powell</hi> charges his Highneſſe with ſlighting and blaſpheming
the Spirit of God: Oh great and terrible charge! what is the reaſon ye
expreſſe not, wherein and how it may appear? and ſeeing ye only ſay ſo,
we are to conclude it is a falſe charge till it be proved; ye cry out of hard
dealing by reproaches, yet herein ye exceed above all that ever I read or
heard of.</p>
            <p>15. Ye ſay that we have mens perſons in admiration, becauſe of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
ſerve for wages, as if our owning the preſent Government was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to our underſtandings and conſciences: this I know and beleeve is
untrue, and am fully perſwaded that we have more light of conſcience and
comfort in owning and pleading for the preſent. Government, then they
have in oppoſing it.</p>
            <p>16. Ye ſay that tithes are a Popiſh innovation: that is not true, for they
are Jewiſh; and if they were required upon a civill account, I do beleeve
that it cannot be made to appear that ſuch requiring of them, is neither
Jewiſh, nor Popiſh, nor unlawfull.</p>
            <p>17. Ye ſay that the prayers of the Saints are againſt his Highneſſe: this
is not true, though yours be againſt him alſo, their words plainly imply,
that they eſteem no man a Saint but themſelves.</p>
            <p>18. Ye ſay ye did not intend to pull down one perſon to ſet up another,
(ſome muſt be ſet up if we have any government at all) in that ye ſay, nor
an unrighteous power to promote another; in ſaying the preſent Power
is an unrighteous power, ye ſay not truly, firſt prove it ſo if you can, and
then ſay it; ſo ye meddle not with judging his ends and others ends in
ſtead of jndging your ſelves.</p>
            <p>19. Ye ſay the changing the late Government was unadviſed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable:
we ſay the contrary; I did think that you were againſt
joining the Antichriſtian power with the civill ſword.</p>
            <p>20. So one of the oppoſers ſaid in a pulpit, ſpeaking of his Highneſſe,
ſaid that he was the ſon of a begger, which is neither true in it ſelf nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively;
for he was the ſon of a Gentleman an Eſquire, and was offered
to be knighted and refuſed it; he had a conſiderable eſtate of yearly means
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:168362:10"/>
more then enough; his father was a Knight Sir <hi>Henry Cromwell</hi> and had
an eſtate of yearly means of Sixteen thouſand pounds a year; Sir <hi>Philip</hi>
and Sir <hi>Oliver</hi> were brothers to his Highneſſe Father; the ſaid Sir <hi>Oliver
Cromwell</hi> his Highneſſe Unkle had twelve thouſand pounds a year in old
Rents, and his Highneſſe Mother was Siſter to Sir <hi>Thomas Stewart,</hi> who
was of the kindred and Family of the late King: We glory not in the fleſh,
we glory in God, in being children of God, heirs of heaven and of an
eternal and unſpeakable waight of glory: but this is ſaid to convince them,
that what they ſay is falſe, and that they and others may ſee by what ſpirit
they are led, in oppoſing him. It is a poor cauſe that cannot be carryed
on without lying: but what if his Highneſſe had been the pooreſt man in
the world? then there would have appeared the more of God in raiſing
him ſo high; think ye that we are the leſſe to love and eſteem Ieſus Chriſt
becauſe he and his parents were very poor; that there was no room for
ſuch poor people in the inne, but in a ſtable, fitter for a horſe then a
family though poor. Is there any reaſon to bring that for a charge againſt
a chief Governour that is not true, and if true, is no fault at all? poverty
is none; what reaſon is there to gratifie and pleaſe the enemis of God,
to cauſe them to rejoyce and to pour contempt upon the way of God for
exalting them of low degree: Love covers a multitude of ſins, 1 Pet. 4. 8.
and want of love makes thoſe ſins that are none.</p>
            <p>21. There was a book printed called a Declaration of Members of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
Churches, and a number of names as of one congregation, and
there was not one of that congregation ſigned it; this I can prove: is not
this a way of lying and diſſimulation? <hi>Saith the Lord, I am againſt them
that cauſe my people to erre by their lies, they ſhall not profit,</hi> Ier 33. 32.</p>
            <p>Thus I have given you a proof of ſome of the evils ye are carryed away
with, and that which is here ſaid is enough to prove that death and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is in your paths, you are fallen, you are fallen, and almoſt, if not
altogether become one in oppoſing with thoſe that God hath ſufficiently
witneſſed againſt: know that God is for us, and that ye ſight againſt God,
therefore ye cannot proſper: his Highneſſe may ſay to each of you, <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
thee from medling with God who is with me, that he deſtroy thee not,</hi>
2 Chron. 35. 21, 22. I be ſeech you conſider what I ſay, and weigh it in
the ſight of God with a calm and Chriſtian ſpirit; and harden not your
necks againſt the truth, as you will anſwer it to the great Iudge. Oh that
you would lie down in the duſt and acknowledge your iniquity, and return
unto God by unfaigned repentance; haſt to do it, leſt Gods fury break
forth like fire upon you, and there be no quenching: your return would
rejoyce us much, as being welwiſhers to your ſouls and bodies, though I
muſt declare againſt your ſins, deſigns, and way, becauſe ye have call an
odium upon all the people of God that do own and ſubmit to the preſent
Government, charged us with hypocriſie and diſſimulation, and by your
ſo doing ye caſt an odium upon the Name of Chriſt which we profeſſe, your
lies are manifeſt, your carriage is not in meekneſſe, nor are your ſouls
poſſeſſed with patience; ye are murmuters and complainers without cauſe,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:168362:10"/>
you father your words and actions in oppoſing to be of God and from the
holy Spirit of God, which is a blaſpheming of the Spirit of God: you
are very unjuſt and unreaſonable to charge his Highneſſe ſo deeply and
falſly, becauſe you never did nor can prove what you ſay to be true; Are ye
ſo greatly deluded to think that ſuch preaches and printings as ye make
againſt the Government and Governors will do any good, except only to
diſcover your madneſſe and folly to all men? I know you are great tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors,
and diſclaim all your oppoſition of the Government, &amp;c. ye grieve
the faithfull in that ye cauſe diviſions and diſſenſions contrary to the
doctrine ye have heard and learnt; therefore we deſire and warn all that
fear the Lord, and all others that deſire their outward ſafety to withdraw
from you and avoid you, as thoſe that by good words and fair ſpeeches de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the hearts of the ſimple and are cauſers of diviſions, as Rom. 16.
17, 18. and that ye by your oppoſition ſtrengthen the hands of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and harden the late Kings party in their evill oppoſing, and ye ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove,
and juſtifie, and own by your practiſe all the oppoſition that hath
been made againſt the people of God, and ſo are partakers of their ſin,
and are liable to their puniſhments: ſubmit to God, ſeek meekneſſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
Rom. 14. 19. Jam. 3. 18. if ye will not deſiſt, your wilfulneſſe in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
will prove your ſorrow, if not your ruine.</p>
            <p>And for the late Kings party, I deſire they would conſider that God
hath witneſſed againſt them in the deſtruction and ruine of the late King
and many of them, ſome ſay there hath been ſlain about eight hundred
thouſand in the late vvar in the three nations; to whom muſt all this
bloud be laid, but upon them which begun the war, and that was the
late King and thoſe that ſided with him. Say not he had cauſe to do that he
did; what ever the cauſe was he ſhould not have begun a war, and God
hath judged him for it: they have had many times the advantage of us in
number and otherwiſe; there hath been of their ſide many that have not
wanted skill nor will, reſolution nor courage, they have had ſeverall
times plain field battels, and ſeveral times tryed for it; from whence is
it that they have ſo often loſt the day and have not prevailed nor can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail?
it is plain enough expreſſed, I would they could ſee it, in Jer. 1. 19.
its time for them to conſider that they have had multitudes of plots and
devices, and all fruitleſſe; know ye not that many of you have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
and ruined? and if ye will ſtill fight againſt God, it will be your
ruine alſo; if ye are willing to be deſtroyed, yet pity your wives and
little ones, who are like to ſuffer and periſh by your ruine: for their and
your own good, ceaſe oppoſing and plotting I beſeech you ſubmit to God,
Pſal. 66. 3. and be preſerved, if ye oppoſe ye periſh, they that have thought
otherwiſe have been often deceived; Do ye not ſee, the more ye oppoſe,
the worſe ye are? for now ye have leſſe favour and more charged then
afore, yet do not think that ye are too hardly dealt with by his Highneſſe
late proclamation, &amp;c. he dealt too kindely and friendly with you till be
did ſee that you were the worſe for kindneſſe, and that the requitall ye gave
him was to ſeek his life and our ruine, for which ye deſerve to die;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:168362:11"/>
therefore ye may be content and glad ye ſcape as ye do, it is not fit to let
you have a way and means to nouriſh you and inable you to ſeek our ruine.
If ye will be quiet and peaceable, favour will be given you that you may
live and your families: I fear you would hardly extend that favour to
us if you were in our condition and we in yours. Seeing God hath ſo
often witneſſed againſt you, be at laſt <hi>afraid of his tokens,</hi> as Pſal. 65. 8.
before it be too late, I adviſe you for your good, it will be well for you if
God will give you eyes to ſee it, and hearts to receive it.</p>
            <p>I ſay to all that oppoſe the preſent Government and Governors; why
are ye ſo offended at his Government? what evill hath he done? and why
are ye ſo offended at his Highneſſe? what hath he done? whom hath he
wronged? what hath he got by his great place, but great care, trouble,
danger, reproaches, and that for ſeeking the welfare of others? are ye an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
for his doing his duty, for ſeeking the welfare and preſervation of
himſelf and others? is not his intereſt and ſafety one and the ſame with
the intereſt and ſafety of the people of God? the welfare of the one is in
the other, and all in God.</p>
            <p>True, there are three great oppreſſions not yet removed that many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of, though they were not cauſed by this Government, but were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it, and we hope and wait for a redreſſe therein; the firſt will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
if that which is ſaid in the Inſtrument concerning the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of the States Miniſters be performed; the ſecond will be removed if
ſome way may be to prevent the great corruption in the Law and the
Miniſters of it; I hear they are upon it: the other will be removed if the
Souldiers Arreers, publick Faith, and Debts of the Nation may be paid;
if the State cannot pay it, it is fit the loſſe and burden be borne equally
by this Nation according to their ability; if it cannot be ſo paid in one
year, it may in many years; they may ſtay that can ſpare it: many of
thoſe that had great ſums due to them, have not bread to eat, to them it
is a great grievance to want their due; and if they that are ſo oppreſſed
be ſilent, their oppreſſion will cry to God for help: we are not out of
hope of remedy in theſe things, becauſe his Highneſſe aimeth at the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
good of the nation, and juſt liberty of every man: he alſo is a
godly man, one that feareth God and eſcheweth evill, though he is, nor no
man elſe, without humane frailey; he is faithfull to the Saints and to
theſe Nations in whatſoever he hath undertaken from the beginning of
the wars, he hath owned the poor deſpiſed people of God, and advanced
many of them to a better way and means of living; he hath been an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate
for the Chriſtians, and hath done them much good in writing,
ſpeaking, pleading for their liberty to the long Parliament, and fighting
for their liberty; he with others hath hazarded his life, eſtate, family,
and ſince he hath refuſed great offers of wealth and worldly glory for the
ſake and welfare of the people of God: God hath given him more then
ordinary wiſdome, ſtrength, courage, and valour; God hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
with him, and given him great ſucceſſes; he is fitted to bear bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,
and to endure all oppoſition and contradictions, that may ſtand

with publique ſafety; he is a terror to his enemies, he hath a large heart,
ſpirit and principle, that will hold all that fear the Lord, though of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
opinions and practiſes in Religion, and ſeek their welfare; it is
the honour of Princes to pity the miſerable, to relieve the oppreſſed and
wrongs of the poor; he is humble and deſpiſeth not any becauſe poor,
and is ready to hear and help them; he is a mercifull man, full of pity
and bounty to the poor, a liberall heart is more precious then heaven and
earth; he gives in money to maimed ſouldiers, widowes, and orphans, and
poor families, a thouſand pound a week to ſupply their wants; nothing in
man more reſembleth the nature of God, then a pitifull nature to ſupply
others wants; he is not a lover of money, that is a ſingular and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
thing; I never obſerved in any ſo little love of money, if he
have to ſpare, and know others that are in want, he will give and not
hoard up money as ſome do; and if he had never ſo much money, he
would lay it out for the benefit of theſe Nations to the beſt of his skill;
I am perſwaded that there is not a better friend to theſe Nations and
people of God among men, and that the people of God are not beholding
to any man on earth ſo much as they are to him, and that there is not
any man ſo much unjuſtly cenſured and abuſed as he is; and ſome that
now finde fault with him may live to ſee and confeſſe, that what I have
herein written is truth, and when he is gathered to his fathers, ſhall weep
for want of him. Oh that we had more thankfull hearts for the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of his mercies that we enjoy, and God grant his Highneſſe long to
be over us, and that he may never want a heart, power nor time to do
thoſe things that are for the glory of God and the good of theſe
Nations. The day will come that his Highneſſe ſhall be out
of the reach of all reproaches, cares, pain and trouble, and ſhall enjoy
an exceeding and eternall weight of glory, where his joy and peace ſhall
be ſweet, full, and eternall, and be for ever with the Lord, where are ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of pleaſures, happineſſe and glory for evermore.</p>
            <p>I do think my ſelf bound in nature, reaſon, and religion, to own, ſpeak,
and write as I do in defence of the preſent Government and Governors,
for theſe reaſons, beſides what I have ſaid.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>A man is to plead for his neighbour,</hi> Job. 16. 21. <hi>He that hath friends
muſt ſhew himſelf friendly,</hi> Prov. 18. 24. and to praiſe him when need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
it, <hi>Let another man praiſe thee, and not thy own mouth; a ſtranger, and
not thy own lips,</hi> Prov. 17. 2. <hi>Paul</hi> being accuſed, ſaid, <hi>I ought to have
been commended by you,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 11. I and others owe him this ſervice as
a neighbour, as a friend, as a Chriſtian, as he is under God, our chief Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
and Protector; for us to hear him ſo abuſed, reviled, and unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
condemned, and be ſilent, is not only unjuſt, but very unchriſtian, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall,
and unreaſonable, and a great diſcouragement to his Highneſſe,
for us not to do ſo much as ſpeak in his behalf.</p>
            <p>2. His ſervice and ſuffering for us in the late wars, and his great care,
pains and danger for us, deſerves much more of every one of us, then to
ſpeak and write for him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:168362:12"/>
3. Others ſpeaking againſt him unjuſtly, conſtraineth us to witneſſe the
truth againſt them, though I expect to be greatly blamed for it by them:
I conſider Heb. 12. 2, 3, 4.</p>
            <p>4. There are ſeverall things printed againſt his Highneſſe which are not
true, which thoſe that are unborn may ſee it's neceſſary that they alſo ſee
an anſwer to them, and know that as ſome did write againſt him, that there
were others that would write for him.</p>
            <p>5. We ought to ſeek the peace of the place where we live: when there
was a ſtir againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> as now there is, <hi>Caleb ſtilled the people,</hi> Numb.
13. 30.</p>
            <p>6. Self-preſervation admits us not to be ſilent, ſeeing others not only
hazarding our eſtates and our lives, but alſo indangering the ruine of
the three Nations; I love the ſafety and quiet of my Countrey, and to
uſe means for the ſafety of my ſelf and others.</p>
            <p>7. In charity to others, ſeeing them through miſtakes ſin and endanger
their eſtates, liberties and lives, means is to be uſed to prevent it, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one to inform, reclaim and ſave them, and ſo to diſcharge our duty
to God and man.</p>
            <p>8. Leſt our ſilence ſhould be a conſent, or interpreted ſo, and be an
incouragement to them in their evill way, to bear witneſſe againſt their
ſin, and clear our ſouls from guilt: becauſe theſe are the preſent truths
we are to own, every work being beautifull in its ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>Reaſons to prove that his Highneſſe <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> and the Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
his Councell ought to execute the Legiſlative Power.</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe his Highneſſe and Councell is in a capacity to exerciſe the
ſaid Power, which is ground ſufficient for them to exerciſe it: he who is
able to do good without commiſſion, need no commiſſion to do it: if I
were able to remove all the oppreſſions under the ſun, I would not aske nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
leave, power nor commiſſion to do it; power and commiſſion is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to effect that good which cannot be effected without it; there is no
ground to think the poor man had a commiſſion to deliver the City, yet he
did do it and was commended for the ſame, Eccleſ. 9. 15, 16.</p>
            <p>2. God by his providence ſetting them in the higheſt place, is Gods call
to execute the higheſt power, which is Legiſlative; they are called Gods,
becauſe they have a power to make and give forth Lawes for civill peace
and welfare of the people; the exerciſe of which is a chief part of their
duty in that place; and the reaſons that juſtifieth their being chief Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors,
requireth and doth juſtifie their exerciſing of this power; and
that which will juſtifie and ſecure his Highneſſe and Councell in that they
have done, will do the ſame for the exerciſing of his power.</p>
            <p>3. The ſum and ſubſtance of the Law of the Land requireth their exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of this power; The ſafety of the people is the ſupreme Law, ſo that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
is for the ſafety and welfare of the people, ought to be done, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be by taking away bad Lawes, or making good Lawes.</p>
            <p>4. The neceſſity of theſe nations is ſuch in generall, that it doth daily
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:168362:12"/>
ſtand in need of the exerciſe of the ſaid power, alſo many greatly ſuffer
by reaſon of the want thereof, there being many grievances which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be removed without it; ſome ſeeking relief in their ſeverall cauſes
are informed, that it belongs to thoſe that have the Legiſlative Power to
relieve them; therefore as great a neceſſity as there is of relieving the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
ſo great a neceſſity there is of the exerciſe of this power; for
without this their oppreſſion cannot be removed, and their neceſſities
are ſuch as cannot admit of any delay, much leſſe to ſtay till the next Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
if they ſhould, who knoweth whether they will help or no? <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
the tears of ſuch as were oppreſſed, and they had no comforter, on this
ſide of their oppreſſors there was power but they had no comforter,</hi> Eccleſ. 4. 1.
So that his Highneſſe and Councell knowing the neceſſity of this power,
ſhould be convinced in conſcience that it is their duty to exerciſe it; God
requireth to do as they would be done unto, and to love their neighbour
as themſelves, the argument for the exerciſing of the ſaid power, is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
neceſſities of others requireth it, and there is not any thing that
doth more tempt thoſe that are for this power to be againſt it, then the
the not exerciſing the ſaid power to relieve theſe grievances.</p>
            <p>5. The Law of God requireth the exerciſe of this power, for it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
that oppreſſions and things hurtful and grievous be removed, that
ſo the oppreſſed be relieved, but this cannot be done without this power,
therefore the exerciſe of the ſaid power is neceſſary and required by the
Law of God.</p>
            <p>6. There is iniquity by a law, there be ſome lawes unjuſt, others ill
framed, there be tricks in the Law which cauſe great ſufferings and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
in the officers, that iniquity in ſtead of juſtice runneth down like
a mighty ſtream, and hath ſo continued a long time, and there is no way to
ſtop it but in the exerciſe of the ſaid power, in making a new Law to help
the one and hinder the other.</p>
            <p>7. The end of power is to prevent evill and do good: the exerciſe of
this power would both prevent much evill and do much good; and as this
is the greateſt among men, ſo the exerciſe of it is able to effect the greateſt
good; and in as much as there is not any great excellent and ſingular
good thing can be effected without it, ſo much the greater neceſſity there
is, that his Highneſſe and Councell ſhould exerciſe the ſaid power.</p>
            <p>8. There is not any unwilling that his Highneſſs and Councell ſhould
exerciſe the ſaid power, but thoſe that are unwilling that they ſhould
exerciſe any power at all, and alſo evill doers deſire it not, leſt it ſhould
hinder their evill proceedings; thoſe that are for the having any power,
deſire to have it in its greateſt perfection.</p>
            <p>9. His Highneſſe Oath expreſſed in the inſtrument, is ſo far from
hindring their exerciſe of the ſaid power, that it ingageth them thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;
for his Highneſſe is ingaged to cauſe juſtice to be equally admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred,
then he muſt of neceſſity exerciſe this power, elſe juſtice will not
be equally adminiſtred: the 8. Article in the inſtrument refers to
Article 30. his Highneſſe is to make Lawes and Ordinances for the peace
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:168362:13"/>
and welfare of theſe Nations where it ſhall be neceſſary, which ſhall be
binding and in force untill the Parliament meet, and order ſhall be taken
concerning the ſame; therefore although the Parliament hath met, yet
in aſmuch as they have not taken order concerning the ſame, his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and Councell is to exerciſe the ſaid power untill order be taken for
the ſame; alſo ſome ſay they were no Parliament becauſe they made no
Seſſions.</p>
            <p>10. A courſe in it ſelf ſingular and unjuſtifiable, by reaſon of ſome
circumſtances falling in, may not only become lawfull, but a duty: So
<hi>Phinchas</hi> act was an exerciſe of power though he was no Magiſtrate,
Numb. 25. 7. 8. God commended it, and rewarded it, 11, 12, 13. Pſal.
106. 30. 31. So <hi>David</hi> eat the ſhew bread which was not lawfull for him
to eat, Mat. 12. Neceſſity made it lawfull.</p>
            <p>Some ſay the Law is againſt it, and that it is not good to alter a law,
but to alter a bad law and make a new Law for the peace and welfare of
the Nation, is not ill but well: God is pleaſed to alter and change ſome
things in his own Law and make new ones; and muſt the lawes of
men admit of no change? men and their lawes are not perfect, times, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
and caſes alter, and require alteration; the late diſpenſations of
God in theſe Nations have been carried on contrary to the letter of the
Law, the ſafety of the people of God hath lain in croſſing the letter of
the Law, which hath occaſioned his Highneſſe to do that he hath done
for the welfare of the people of God.</p>
