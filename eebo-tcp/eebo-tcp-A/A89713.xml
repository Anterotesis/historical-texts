            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It is taken for ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt
or medicament.
So the <hi>Philoſophicall
Stone</hi> is termed a Medicine. The
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:170298:6"/>
Lord hath created Medicines out of
the Earth, and the wiſe man will
not abhor them. Secondly, It is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for the habit, or profeſſion of the
Phyſitian, and then it ſignifies the
faculty of curing exiſtent in ſome
learned and expert Profeſſor. This
habit or faculty is delineated, or
methodically deſcribed and laid
down in the Dogmaticall Books of
Phyſicians, that others may learne
and practiſe thereby. Thirdly, It is
taken for, and ſignifies a Phyſicall
Syſtem or Treatiſe, and in this latter
ſence it is to be underſtood in this
place.</p>
               <p>The Object of Medicine or Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
in this latter ſence is, Man, not
in general, but that man onely who
deſires to learn the Art of Phyſick,
and is to be informed or inſtructed
by this preſent Treatiſe: but the
Object of Phyſick, as it is an habit
in the mind of the Phyſician, is
man in general, either for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170298:6"/>
or the reſtoring of his health.
The operation, uſe, and end of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
is health; as the work and end
of Phyſical books, is a rightly
principled and inſtructed Phyſitian;
ſo far as inſtruction goes: It is termed
<hi>Hermetical Phyſicke,</hi> becauſe it is
grounded upon <hi>Principles</hi> of true
<hi>Philoſophy,</hi> as the Phyſick of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes</hi>
was. And for this very reaſon
the true Philoſophers applyed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
wholly to the <hi>Hermetic</hi> ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that they might thereby lay
a true foundation of Phyſick, for
the <hi>Hermetic</hi> Phyloſophy layes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
the moſt private and abſtruſe
cloſets of nature, it doth moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitely
ſearch and find out the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of health and ſickneſs, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
moſt elaborate and effectuall
Medicines, teacheth the juſt Doſe
of them, and ſurpaſſeth by many
degrees the vulgar Philoſophy, and
that faculty which is grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the principles of the common,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:170298:7"/>
ſuppoſititious knowledge, that is to
ſay, it doth much exceed and out do
the <hi>Galenical Phyſick.</hi> This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
moſt evidently, becauſe the
<hi>Hermetical Phiſicians</hi> both can and
frequently doe cure thoſe diſeaſes,
which the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> adjudge to be
incurable, as the Leproſie, the falling
ſickneſs, the Gout, &amp;c. That the
Principles of the <hi>Hermetiſts,</hi> are
more certain then thoſe of <hi>Galen,</hi> is
ſufficiently verified by their perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances;
beſides, it is a truth which
cannot be denyed, that the Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and proof of the principles of all
Arts, can by no other meanes be
known and tryed but by practiſe,
as <hi>Paracelſus</hi> doth rightly urge <hi>In

all the knowledge of the <hi>Herme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,</hi>
proceeds from a laborious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
diſquiſition and ſearch into na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

and preſcribed Receits, giving all at

adventure and will not be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to inquire further then the
mouth of their leader. I call not
thoſe <hi>Hermetiſts,</hi> who know onely
to diſtil a little water from this or
that Herb; nor thoſe, who ſeeke to
extract from other things by their
ſophiſtical operations a great trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of Gold, which onely nature
can ſupply us with: for the moſt ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
amongſt the people, may
make a very uſeful Diſtiller, and the
other attempt is moſt commonly the
task of Sophiſters and Impoſtors:
but I call them <hi>Hermetiſts,</hi> who
obſerve nature in her workes who
imitate her, and uſe the ſame me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
that ſhe doth, that out of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
by the mediation of nature,
and the aſſiſtance of their owne
judgements, they may produce and
bring to light ſuch rare effectual me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,
as will ſafely, ſpeedily, and
pleaſantly cure, and utterly expell
the moſt deplorable diſeaſes. Theſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170298:8"/>
are the true <hi>Hermetiſts:</hi> As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I doe not approve of all thoſe
that would be called <hi>Hermetiſts,</hi>
So neither doe I condemn all thoſe,
who diligently and conſcientiouſly
practiſe the <hi>Galenicall Phyſick:</hi> for
ſome of them are precize and petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant,
others are ſober &amp; modeſt: and
theſe latter ſort acknowledge the
imperfection of their medicines, and
therefore they endeavour and take
delight to adome, inlarge, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh
their profeſſion with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
of <hi>Hermetical Phyſick:</hi> but
the other ſort aſcribe ſupreme per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to that Ethnic, Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
writer, and his medicines, and
will not for meer envy, or out of a
childiſh depraved ignorance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> looke
upon the eminency of <hi>Hermetic
Philoſophy,</hi> nor inquire into the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
of it, but ſeek rather by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
and carping thoſe things
they doe not underſtand, to magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
their own way, and with peeviſh
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170298:8"/>
and virulent language, raile at the
<hi>Hermetic</hi> profeſſors. Now as I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
the <hi>Hermetical</hi> ſcience to the
medicines of theſe men: ſo (their
Errours being firſt laid aſide,) I u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
it with the Phyſick of the more
ſober <hi>Galeniſts,</hi> that theirs by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoclation
with ours, may become
perfect and irreprehenſible:</p>
               <p>This <hi>Joſeph Quercetar,</hi> a moſt
expert Phyſician, and a learned Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher,
whom as my maſter in
this ſcience I worthily honour, (for
I muſt confeſs, that by his inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
(God aſſiſting me,) I benefited
very much,) did moſt happily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme.
And many learned men even
in this Age deſign the ſame thing,
eſpecially the profeſſors of Phyſick
in <hi>Marburg,</hi> who by an expreſs and
memorable decree of the moſt il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious
and mighty Prince <hi>William
Lantgrave</hi> of <hi>Haſſia,</hi> proceed in
that very courſe. And who then can
juſtly blame me, for walking in the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170298:9"/>
ſame path with ſuch eminent men?
I ſhall conclude, and give my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with learned <hi>Crollius</hi> (a man
who for the advancement of the
true Phyſick, was moſt worthy of
a longer life) that whoſoever deſires

(and none can be ſo, that will ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

becauſe they have alwayes

mixt in them ſome portion of earth
(though the predominant part in
them be Liquefactive,) are in the
body of man termed <hi>Tartar;</hi> a moſt
apt (in truth) and moſt ſignificant
terme, which was firſt given them
from the Analogy, or ſimilitude that
was found betwixt the humours in
mans body, yea betwixt his very
blood and the ſubſtance of wine:
which of all the fruits of vegetables,
doth moſt abound with <hi>Tartar.</hi> I
doe not meane by <hi>Tartar</hi> in this
place that ſubſtance which is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
and flowes in new Wines,
while they are thick and turbid,
which being afterwards ſeparated, or
(as the common phraſe is) ſettled,
doth as the groſſer, earthy, and more
impure part ſubſide into a feculent
ſubſtance, found alwaies in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome,
and called Dregs. Neither doe
I mean that <hi>Tartar</hi> onely, whoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
is performed by a long
Tract of time, and ſticks to the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:170298:26"/>
Dregs or Lees of old Wine-pipes.
But I meane that <hi>Tartar</hi> alſo, which
is in perpetual liquefaction and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture
with the moſt refined wines,
and which gives them their tincture
either red or any other. This true
<hi>Tartar,</hi> either by Evaporation, or
ſimple diſtillation, or a <hi>Balneum

hot, for the more liquid
part of the humour (which was the
<hi>Vehiculum,</hi> in which the <hi>Tartar</hi> in
its diſſolution was contained) being
ſeparated from it, the <hi>Tartar</hi> alone
remaine in the bottom. This liquid
humour, though of red wine, diſtills
all bright and limpid, but the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vler
red ſubſtance, which I call <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi>
ſtayes all behind: a ſolid ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,

or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

joynt-gout, and the ſtone: which
diſeaſes according to the ſentiment
of theſe Dogmatiſts themſelves,
happen moſt frequently to thoſe,
who have the hotteſt Livers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
conſequently the coldeſt ſtomacks:
Who ingenerate much crudities and
mucous matters, which for want of
a through-digeſtion, may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to raw fruits, that failing of
their due and perfect maturity,
(which is performed by a contempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
heat that is all concocting and
digeſting,) remaine acid, bitter,
ſowre and green. Theſe being mixt
with, and in the whole Maſſe of
blood, are there by the natural heate
againe concocted, and a ſeparation
is made of the more crude and tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous
portion, which ſticks after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to the inward parts, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
divers obſtructions, is at length
forcibly carried into the joynts,
where it ſtayes and lodgeth. For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
part of the body of man doth
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170298:28"/>
naturally delight in, and attract to
it, that which is moſt like to it ſelfe:
the fleſhie parts are nouriſhed by that
portion of the blood, which is moſt
thinly moiſt, and mercuriall: the
fat and marrowiſh parts, by that
which is moſt oily, or ſulphureous,
but the joynts which are parts that
be naturally glutinous and mucila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginous,
love that portion which
hath moſt likeneſſe and affinity with
their nature; whence it comes to
paſſe, that this Salſuginous and Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tareous
matter is taken in by them.
Now, when it happens that theſe
parts in ſome bodyes, either for their
weakneſs, or an innate hereditary
diſpoſition, or ſome ſuch cauſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
by a proper and particular di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion,
inoffenſively digeſt, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
this crude and indigeſted Tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous
matter, then is this matter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a ſaltiſh, viſcous nature coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated
in them, and the ligaments
of the joynts come to be ſtuffed up
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:170298:28"/>
and ſtiffened with it, whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
thoſe acute intolerable paines
which attend this Diſeaſe. And this
is the true and genuine conjoyn'd
cauſe of the paines and knottines of
the Joynt-gout. The ſame cauſe is
ſometimes leſſe acute, ſometimes
more, according to the nature and
condition of the <hi>Tartar.</hi> For as we
ſee that there is in the greater world,
a great diverſity of Salts, for the
Earth yeelds firſt Salt-gemme, which
anſwers in proportion to Sea-ſalt,
that is onely ſaltiſh in taſt; then
Salt-nitre which is bitter in taſt, and

                        </gap>,</hi> with others that are
ſweet and pleaſant as Sugar: ſo in
the leſſer world, that is in the body
of man, there is generated a Tartar
or Salt, which being diſſolved, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170298:29"/>
onely a ſaltiſh humour, which
the Dogmatical Phyſicians term ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh
phegme, in plaine termes, a ſalt
water or humour. There is alſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated,
a nitrous or bitter Salt,
which mixeth with the Urine, and
cauſeth bitter Choler; and a vitrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
acid ſalt which predominates
in acid phlegme and melancholy.
In like manner there be alſo alumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
and auſtere kinds of <hi>Tartar,</hi>
and other ſorts which reſemble the
acrimonie of Salt, as it is manifeſtly
ſeen by the various affections of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractures

and, divers Ulcers as well
inward as outward, all which are
cauſed by the many and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent

               <p>FXceſs of Neceſſaries, is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
firſt in Victuals, where
the offence is threefold. 1. In ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluouſneſs.
2. In vairety. 3. In our
manner of receiving them. We offend
in ſuperfluouſneſs, when that which
is to nouriſh us is taken in too great
a quantity: whence follow frequent
and unwholſome evaporations and
belchings, which ſo fill and oppreſſe
the veſſels and Organs of the ſpirits,
that they are hindered in their fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;
or the meat with its weight
and quantity ſo indiſpoſeth us, that
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170298:35"/>
the inordinate operation and digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is retarded. Innumerable are the
Diſeaſes and moleſtations which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from this particular intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
               <p>We offend in variety, when at one
dinner or ſupper, we eate many and
divers kinds of Meats and Drinkes,
for theſe having a great diſſimilitude
and enmity amongſt themſelves,
cauſe divers inconveniences by their
various diſſents and unequall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion.</p>
               <p>We offend in the manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,
when we eate haſtily, or
ſwallow our meat before it be well
chew'd and devour our Drinke like
Whales, as thoſe are accuſtomed who
drink healths (as they term them)

                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:170298:35"/>
Another Exceſs in Neceſſaries,
happens about taking of reſt and
watching: When the Animal ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
by too much ſleep, are by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
habitnated into a certaine dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
ſo that they perform their fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
ſluggiſhly, remitting ſtill
ſomething of their due vigour, until
at length they loſe all their activity,
and are naturalized (as it were) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an incurable ſtupidity. Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rywiſe
by too much watching they
are eaſily inflamed, ſo that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they cauſe Maniacal fits and
phrenſies, with divers others moſt
deſperate conſequences.</p>
               <p>A third exceſs of Neceſſaries,
happens from cold and heat. Exceſs
of heat happens, either when the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
is over exerciſed, or when any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Extraneous heat hath too free
an acceſs to it, and the innate fire
of nature is beyond meaſure excited
thereby, ſo that inordinate exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170298:36"/>
are cauſed in the body, which
produce an exceſſive and dangerous
reſolution and weakneſs of parts.
Exceſs of cold happens either by
a ſuddaine Refrigeration or cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after Exerciſe, or when we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
our ſelves too much to cold
weather, which hinders the evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Excrementitious Exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
by ſtopping the Pores, and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them back into the body, where
they lodge and remaine. Whence it
comes to paſs, that being of an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarious
malignant diſpoſition, they
afford matter and foment for many
and ſeverall kinds of diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>A like exceſs to this, proceeds fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
from the hardneſs and thick
Callouſneſs of ſome peoples skins,
by which fault (becauſe little or

<hi>ſecret,</hi> and the <hi>Ambient</hi> Aire of their
bodies is intercepted, ſo that there
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170298:36"/>
is no liberty for inſpiration or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration.</p>
               <p>Defect of Neceſſaries is firſt, the
want of meat and drink in their due
time and proportion. This is either
famine or thirſt. Secondly The want
of naturall reſt, according to the

               <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, the want of

when it is carried (indeed) to the

parts; but the weakneſs of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive
faculty is ſo great, that it
cannot drive it out. Secondly, When
it is left in the very ſtomack without
farther Excluſion. Thirdly, when
ſome ſubtil poyſon, in and together
with the nutritive portion or Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,
doth convey and inſinuate it ſelf
into the moſt inward parts of the
body: which poyſon was firſt taken
in with meat and drink. It happens
often (ſaith the moſt learned and
expert <hi>Quercetanus</hi>) that when the
naturall Balſame is tainted by ſome
impurity proceeding from food or
nutriment, it doth afterwards give
way and occaſion for many dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
ſymptomes and diſeaſes. This

Putrified things grow
to be noyſome and hurtfull,
by the meanes of thoſe corroſive
Salts and fuliginous Exhalations,
which partly by an externall, partly
by their own internall heat, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
out of them and diſperſed.
Moreover the Excrements of man,
when they happen to be retained in

                     </gap>e.
Therefore thoſe Diſeaſes which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from the indiſpoſition of the
Salt, are radically fixt, and for the
moſt part Hereditary, as the <hi>Lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,</hi>
the <hi>Stone,</hi> the <hi>Joynt-gout,</hi> and the
like. But thoſe Diſeaſes which ſpring
from any infirmity of the fluxible
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:170298:40"/>
and volatile principles, that is to ſay,
from <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Sulphur</hi> (as all
manner of Cathars and Feavers do,)
cannot ſo eaſily infect poſterity: for
theſe Diſeaſes neither fix their ſeeds
firmly, nor deeply, becauſe they have
not their tinctures ſo tenaciouſly
impreſt. The nature of this kind
of fixed Salt or Sulphur, may be
perfectly diſcern'd in the ſeeds and
the roots of Plants: for if you take
but ſome particles of them, and
tranſplant them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thoſe very peeces
will take root and grow, and bear
fruit: But neither the leaves, nor
the flowers in which the volatile
Mercury &amp; Sulphur have their ſeat,
will do ſo. Now the fixed Salt is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
conſerved in the root, and in
ſome pithy ſtalks &amp; Siens or Graffes:
but the fixed Sulphur is in the ſeed.
And this is the reaſon that the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plantation
of all <hi>Vegetals,</hi> is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by theſe onely: but by the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curiall
parts, which eaſily fade and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170298:41"/>
wither, it cannot be done; nor by
thoſe parts, which have onely in
them a volatile Sulphur, as the
flowers, and the leaves of ſome Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables.
See <hi>Quercetan,</hi> in his advice
againſt the joynt-gout, and the
ſtone.</p>
                  <p>Therefore (ſaith the ſame <hi>Quer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetanus</hi>)
whatever lodgeth in the
body of the parents, that with a firm,
ſpiritual, impure, and malignant
tincture can affect or infect the radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Balſame, the vital ſeed, and the
very root or fundamentall of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature: that ſame impurity
(whatever it be) doth by an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary
tranſplantation paſs into, and
infect the Children. But if theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure
ſeeds of Diſeaſes, have not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
ſuch a deep root, nor ſo far cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
the radicall Balſame: or if by
the helpe of nature, and her inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Balſame, there is a ſeparation
made of them; or if by the miniſtry
of Art, and externall, ſpecifical Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſames
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170298:41"/>
of Phyſick, they are effectually
allayed and weakned, or are come to
their proper terme and utmoſt du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
ſo that their virulency and
force is quite ſpent and broken: in
any of theſe Cauſes, Gouty and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous
perſons, doe not alwaies beget
Gouty and Leprous Children. For
by theſe means, the roots of Diſeaſes,
even the moſt fixt and malignant
are eradicated, impure ſeeds are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,
and the morbid tincture by
long traduction becomes quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct.
This Eradication of heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Diſeaſes, and Purification of
diſeaſed ſeed comes to paſſe by the
benefit and aſſiſtance of good <hi>Seed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plots,</hi>
that is, by the excellent, whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
temperament of the <hi>Matrix,</hi>
in vegetous and healthy women:
whence it happens, that the Fathers
ſeed, though tainted with ſome
morbific indiſpoſition, is by the
laudable vigour of the mothers ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical
<hi>Balſame</hi> amended, ſo that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170298:42"/>
Arthritical and Calculous Fathers
beget Children, which all their life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
continue healthy and unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
by ſuch Diſeaſes. Yea, they
beget ſuch Children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
or liable to ſuch indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
In like manner alſo it happens,
that a vegetous, healthy Father,
contributing good ſeed, may have a
ſickly, impure iſſue, troubled with
hereditary infirmities, the Fathers
ſeed attracting to it the malignant
propriety of thoſe Diſeaſes which
poſſeſſed the Mother. Thus good
Corne, if it be caſt into a bad ſoile,
will degenerate into Tares, or yeeld
a very bad and a thin Crop: but ſow
it againe in good ground, and it
will recover its former goodneſſe
and perfection.</p>

A certaine woman great with

into the Oven with his Doublet off,
longed for a peece of the Bakers
ſhoulder, and when any other meat
was offered unto her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or brought in

to vomit. Her Husband diſtreſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
love and pitty, offered ſuch a
large ſumme of money to the Baker,
that he conſented, &amp; ſuffered her to
bite off two morſels of his fleſh, but
being not able to endure the pain the
third time, the woman preſently
fell in Labour, and was delivered of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170298:43"/>
three boyes, whereof two were alive,

and the knowledge of them, can
no where be had, but from God,
whom we can ſerve by no other
means in this life, but onely by piety,
and piety hath included in it fervent
and inceſſant ſupplications unto
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:170298:51"/>
God, hearty and frequent thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings
for his gracious and free bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
with ſincere and actuall love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
our Neighbours. God is ſo
infinitely good and kind, that he
doth dayly give, and offer both to
the <hi>good</hi> and to the <hi>bad,</hi> all thoſe
things which are neceſſary both for
their <hi>ſuſtenance</hi> and their <hi>health:</hi> but
that we uſe thoſe gifts to the glory
of God, and the good of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
piety alone is the onely cauſe.
Therefore, if thou deſireſt to ſelect,
and extract convenient and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Medicines out of thoſe Myriads
of Creatures, which by the ſecret
power of their Creator, dayly flow
upon thee, &amp; appear about thee, <hi>Fear
God, and love thy Neighbour as thy

thee, thou ſhalt find thoſe things,
which will fill thee with joy. Thou

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:170298:59"/>
Medicaments to be mingled with the
ſluttiſh and venemous compoſitions
of others, leſt the ill conſequence of
ſuch doings be laid to their charge,
and the ſucceſs or good event (if any
comes to paſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) be arrogated by,
and aſcribed unto thoſe impudent
and clamorous impoſtors; for ſuch a
perverſe and execrable envy poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
theſe Medicaſters, that to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
thoſe that are more learned
and expert than themſelves, and to
keep up their owne decaying repute,
they will (if they can have that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity)
caſt thoſe Patients which
are curable and towards recovery,
into an incurable and hopeleſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
Hence it comes to paſs, that
amongſt the common ſort of people,
(who ſuffer moſt by them) they are
publiquely ſaluted by the moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Title of <hi>Profeſt Poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third reaſon is, Becauſe the
Phyſician is called upon too late,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:170298:59"/>
when nature is quite maſtred or ore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
and the diſeaſe hath got his
full ſway; otherwiſe if convenient
or proper medines were ſeaſonable,
(that is to ſay, in a time of preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by reſiſting the beginnings and
firſt attempts of diſeaſes) admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred,
no doubt but (with Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
and aſſent) the conſequence and
effect would be happineſſe and
health.</p>
                  <p>The fourth reaſon is, becauſe the
ſick perſon will not punctually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the Phyſicians preſcriptions:
for it happens too often, that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſed
people charge the Phyſician or
his Medicines, with thoſe ill events
which by ſome omiſſion or irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
(contrary to that golden Law
of the <hi>Locrenſes</hi> in <hi>Ael<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>anu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi>)
they have drawne upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>The fifth reaſon is, becauſe the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:170298:60"/>
nature or peculiar propriety of ſome
perſons, are not inclinable or adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to health, as we ſee ſome timber
to be ſo tough and knotty, and out
of a certaine natural defect, to dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
into ſuch an untowardneſſe,
that by no force or Art it can be cleft
or wrought: And it happens very
frequently, that the time choſen for
healing, together with the indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of the Stars, oppoſe the Cure:
for what ever Diſeaſe is unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably,
that is to ſay, immaturely
heal'd, the party will be ever after
ſubject to a relapſe, becauſe it is the
ſeaſonableneſſe or fulneſſe of time,
that (like harveſt) gives a firme
and a fixed health. A ripe Pear will
fall off the Tree ſpontaneouſly, but if
we ſeeke to have it off, while it is
green, we muſt either bruiſe the tree
by ſhaking it, or with more violence
break off the bough. Therefore, if
theſe conſiderations be neglected, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
in the Cure of <hi>Aſtral</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:170298:60"/>
we ſhall but loſe our labour,
and come off with prejudice. Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
alſo muſt religiouſly provide,
that the remedies they give, prove
not worſe then the Diſeaſe, therefore
let them never adviſe their Patients
to any impious courſe, nor conſent
to doe thoſe things, which by ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the ſore, deſtroy the ſoule and
the body too: let it be their chiefe
care not to hurt, if they cannot help.
By doing ſo, they will keep a good
conſcience, which is a continuall
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eaſt, but for a bad one there is no
medicine.</p>
                  <p>The ſixth reaſon is, becauſe the
diſeaſe is come to that pitch or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,
from whence there can be
no regreſs by the Laws of nature, as in
perfect, abſolute, and confirmed bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuminous,
maſſie, ſandy, and ſtony
coagulations: for in ſuch conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Diſeaſes, no medicines can availe:
nor in a native deafneſſe or blindneſs:
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:170298:61"/>
for what nature her ſelfe hath once
deprived us off, that cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
by any Artiſts, no more then
corporall diſproportions and birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maimes,
or tranſpoſitions can be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.</p>
                  <p>The ſeventh Cauſe or Reaſon is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the ſordid, tenacious parcimonie of
ſome rich Patients, which makes the
Phyſician (for no Money is better
disburſed, nor more honeſtly gotten)
diſcontented and careleſſe: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
alſo the diffidence, incredulity,
and ſuſpition of Patients, (though
the Phyſician be never ſo faithful and
diligent,) hinders the operation of
the Medicine, and is a great impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the Phyſician himſelf.</p>
                  <p>The eighth and laſt reaſon is, the
wiſdome and the goodneſſe of God,
who (without further toleration)
takes away the Patient, leſt being
recovered, he ſhould commit more,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:170298:61"/>
and more heynous offences againſt
his Maker, his Neighbour, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
to the utter miſery and perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his ſoul. For every diſeaſe is
an expiatory penance, and by this
divine affliction, correction and rod
of judgement is the patient called
upon, and required to amend his
life: or elſe by this fatherly viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and impoſition of the Croſſe,
which every child of God (in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of his bleſſed Sonne) muſt
patiently bear, he is purpoſely exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
to be an example of piety, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
and perfection unto others;
for God doth oftentimes permit ſome
particular perſons to be afflicted with
many and grievous Diſeaſes, whom
the cheerefulneſs and health of the
fleſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with their dayly continuation
in ſins (if left without rebuke,) had
caſt at length into ſome deſperate
ſpirituall malady, to the manifeſt
hazard of their eternal welfare: for
health<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without holineſſe, and a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:170298:62"/>
reſentment of of our frequent
infirmities, is no token of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
but rather of damnation, and
the portion of this life. Moreover,
ſinnes by weakning the forces and
activities of the ſoule, make her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
and unfit to govern the body;
ſo that the principall part being ſick
and unapt to rule, the bodily facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are profuſely waſted and abuſed,
and ſo death is haſtned on, and with
it a total and a finall deſtruction. At
leaſt by this yoke and bridle of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
as by a wholſome kind of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,
men will be retained in the
ordinary offices of piety, and (though
they be but few, who are effectually
reclaimed or converted by it,) yet
this detainment of their health
(which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſtill left to them, they
had ſtill abuſed,) will in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
reſtrain and cut off from them,
both the liberty and the power of
ſinning. Hitherto the moſt learned
<hi>Crollius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:170298:62"/>
Thou wilt now (perhaps) object,
that ſeeing all Diſeaſes are not cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
it is conſequently abſurd, to
terme any Medicine univerſal I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
That is termed univerſall, not
becaus it takes away all diſeaſes at all
times &amp; in all Cauſes, for that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
do; but becauſe it being but one,
can expell and cure all thoſe diſeaſes,
which by all other particular or
ſpecifical Medicines whatſoever can,
or have been healed and eradicated;
yea, and ſome diſeaſes which by no
appropriated particular medicine
can be healed, as the Gout, the Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
ſickneſſe, the Dropſie, the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie,
&amp;c. Therefore it is termed u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal,
becauſe it hath in it real and
effectually, all the manifeſt and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
virtues of all other ſpecifical me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
&amp; that eminently, or by way
of tranſcendency, ſo that all other
medicines are ſubordinate and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptable

exact judgement is given of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients
preſent condition, and the
wayes and meanes to reſtore him are
better and ſurer laid. By this Courſe,
that opprobrious <hi>German</hi> Proverb,
which ſticks too faſt to ſome young
Adventurers (<hi>Ein newer Arkt, Ein
newer Kirch-hoff:</hi> A new Phyſician
muſt have a new Church-yard,)
would be eaſily refuted and quite
aboliſhed. This very Courſe (after
ſerious and needful conſiderations)
I did heretofore propoſe to my ſelfe,
and to effect it throughly, I procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and entred into mutuall and
friendly Covenants with a certaine
Doctor of Phyſick, who was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned:
and that I might by this
meanes proceed farther in my Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
diſcoveries, I converſed with
him by frequent Letters, and other
more familiar wayes: And this I did,
becauſe I ſuppoſed him (at that time)
to be a true Philoſoſopher, but I
could never receive one line from
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:170298:64"/>
him, that was not wholly dictated
by the ſpirit of pride and arrogancy.
At length, when it fortuned, that
(after a moſt loving invitation, I
could not for very moving, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
reaſons, attend upon
him) he rail'd at me (though al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
innocent,) with moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
imprecations, and virulent lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
terming me an unſanctified
villaine, and laboured by all meanes
to vilifie my ſtudies and perſon, that
by ſuch clamorous and publique diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements,
he might force me to
deſiſt, and give over my profeſſion.
But none of theſe things ſhall move
me: for God will yet give me ſuch
friends, with whom I may freely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate,
and adviſe about Phyſical
operations, and the healing of the
ſick: too much knowledge is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
fooliſhneſs. True Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
walk wholly in the plaine path
of nature. What profits learning,
where pride beares the ſway, and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:170298:64"/>
blinds the owner? I have ever judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the modeſt knowledge to be the
moſt divine. It is true indeed, we
are not all equalls: but let him that
hath more of the light, walke in
that ſhining path with modeſty. I
confeſſe indeed, and it is true, that
he was my ſuperiour by many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
but had he beene moved to this
harſh dealing, by a meer conceit of
his ſuperiority in learning, perhaps
he would not have caſt me off ſo as
he hath done. God reſiſteth the
proud, and gives grace even to the
humble. Yea, the moſt wiſe, and the
bleſſed <hi>JESUS,</hi> did humble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
in the very forme of a ſervant,
that he might familiarly live and
converſe with the moſt obſcure and
inferiour ſort of people: and he was
not aſhamed, nor diſdained to teach
thoſe poore ſpirits, not a ſublunary,
tranſient knowledge, but the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and permanent myſteries of the
Kingdome of heaven. I love ſtill the

learning of ſo eminent a perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
others whom I love, commend
it unto me: But that great know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
which he abuſeth to an inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

I heartily hate. God Almighty (it

which his all diſcerning ſpirit one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

is effectual and proper to expell his
Diſeaſe. If he doth this, the event
will be anſwerable to his faith, and
the Medicine will in all circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
work ſucceſsfully. A firm creduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
chearfull hope and true love and
confidence towards the Phyſician,
and the Medicine, (ſaith that great
Philoſopher <hi>Oſwaldus Crollius,</hi>)
conduce as much to the health of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:170298:68"/>
the Patient, yea ſometimes more,

Naturall faith (I meane not

Chriſt, but the <hi>imaginative <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

which in the day that the firſt man
was created, was then infuſed and
planted in him by God the Father,
and is ſtill communicated to his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity,)
is ſo powerfull, that it can
both expell and introduce Diſeaſes:
as it manifeſtly appeares in times of
infection, when man by his owne
private imagination, out of meere
feare and horrour, generates a <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiliscum
Coeli,</hi> which infects the
Microcoſmical Firmament by means
of the Imaginants ſuperſtition ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as the Patients faith aſſiſts,
or reſiſts. To the faithfull all things
are poſſible, for faith aſcertaines all
thoſe things which are uncertaine:
God can by no meanes be reach'd
and injoy'd of us, but onely by faith:
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:170298:68"/>
whoſoever therefore believes in God,
he operates by the power of God,
and to God all things are poſſible.
But how this is performed, no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
wit can find out: This onely
we can ſay, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aith is an operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or work not of the Bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ever but
of him in whom he believes. Cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
or thoughts, ſurpaſſe the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations
of all Elements and Stars:
for while we imagine and believe,
ſuch a thing ſhall come to paſſe,
that faith brings the worke about,
and without it is nothing done Our
faith that it will be ſo, makes us i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine
ſo: imagination excites a
Star, that Star (by conjunction with
Imagination) gives the effect or
perfect operation. To believe that
there is a medicine which can cure us,
gives the ſpirit of Medicine: that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
gives the knowledge of it and the
Medicine being known, gives health.
Hence it appeares, that a true Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician,
whoſe operations are natural,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:170298:69"/>
is born of this faith, and the ſpirit
(I meane this ſpirit of nature, or
ſtar of medicine,) furthers and aſſiſts
him, according to his faith. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
oftentimes, that an illiterate
man performes thoſe cures by this i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginative
faith, which the beſt
Phyſicians cannot doe with the moſt
ſoveraigne medicines. Sometimes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
this bare perſwaſion or imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
faith heales more and more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually,
then any virtue in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
Medicine, as it was manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
found of late years, in that famous
<hi>Panacea,</hi> or <hi>All-heal</hi> of <hi>Amwaldus,</hi>
and ſince his time, in that new me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinall
ſpring, which broke out
this preſent yeare in the Confines of
<hi>Miſnia</hi> and <hi>Bohemia,</hi> to which an
incredible number of ſick perſons
doe daily reſort. No other cauſe can
be rendred of theſe <hi>Magnalia,</hi> or
rare Phyſical operations, then the
firme and exceſſive affection of the
Patient; for the power, which work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:170298:69"/>
thus, is in the Spirit of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver,
when taking the medicine
without any fear or heſitation, he is
wholly poſſeſſed and inſpired (as it
were) with an actual deſire and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
of health: for the rationall
ſoule, when ſtirred up, and enkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by a vehement imagination, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercomes
nature, and by her own ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall
affections, renewes many
things in her own body or manſion,
cauſing either health or ſickneſſe, and
that not onely in her own body, but
Extraneouſly, or in other bodies.
The efficacy of this naturall faith,
manifeſted it ſelfe in that woman
with the bloody Iſſue, and in the
Centurion. Hitherto are the words
of <hi>Crollius.</hi>
