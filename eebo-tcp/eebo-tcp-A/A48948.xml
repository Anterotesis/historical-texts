            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not my mind nor meaning, neither was it ever my manner, I having now preached the Gospel seven and forty years, in Court, City, Country, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas, to trouble mine Audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie with any long, or large beginnings.</p>
            <p>The Context is a Vision of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible Majesty of the eternall and ever-living God, which takes up all the whole Chapter, wherein Gods celestiall throne, his Session, his heavenly atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, both Seraphicall, and Cherubicall, his awfull pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, his diffused, and displayed glory, in, before, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Throne; his unspeakable Praise, and his infinite Magnificence is pencild and pourtrayed to life in all his
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101551:5"/>
Attributes, &amp; Proprieties, most graphically in Mosaique work and wonderment.</p>
            <p>The Text is a Revelation, and an obvious Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion what was, and is before the throne of God. The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells of my Text may be foure: For herein is a <hi>Throne,</hi> a <hi>Sea,</hi> what manner of Sea, <hi>a Sea of Glasse,</hi> and a resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of what it was like, <hi>even like unto crystall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You will demand of me, What is meant by this throne? I answer, it is Heaven, where God is in his excelling glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. What is this sea of glasse? The world. What is the resemblance? Like unto crystall, but not crystall.</p>
            <p>You haply will aske me further concerning these pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Why Heaven is decyphered by a Throne? For that here on earth Kings have Thrones of Equitie, Justice, Judgement, and other Regall, Royall, and Princely Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives; yet they and we all, with all the world, shall appeare before the glorious throne of Jesus Christ, to give an account of what we have done here in our bodies, be it good or evill. Why is the world set out by a sea? For that it is restlesse as the sea is. Why a sea of glasse? For that it is brittle like glasse. The world is as made of glasse, <hi>Ubi splendet, frangitur,</hi> where it is more shining &amp; resplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, there it soonest cracks and breaks. And lastly, why resembled to crystall? For two respects: The first, in relation to the men of the world, who are gull'd, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by it; the world seeming unto them to be all cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalline, when God knowes, and all godly ones finde by experience, that it is glassie, slippery, brittle, and no preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse in it at all. The second is in relation to God: Crystall is transparent, we all know; how much more is this world, and all the things of this world, with all the actions, transactions, words, and the very imaginations of the thoughts of all mens hearts are open, overt, and obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101551:5"/>
to the knowledge &amp; sight of the great Jehovah Jireth, who ordereth them all according to the counsell of his most sacred and secret will.</p>
            <p>I will spend no more precious time in spelling of the Text; you now (I conceive it) understand it as well as my selfe. The point of Doctrine that I learne out of this Text in the Result of it, is couched in this short breviate, and proposition.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>as a Sea; ever transitory, brittle, and slippery, as a sea of glasse; never satisfactorie, albeit it glitter, and shine like cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stall; and ever open, overt, obvious, and transparent to the</hi>

               <hi>sight and censure of Almighty God, be they couched never so hellishly deep, though they be sunk even to the deeps of the devill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Accommodate me I desire you with your Christian patience but for the space of one houre, and by that time by Gods favour I shall quit this glassie sea, and shew you the Port of our happinesse, Heaven. And give me leave in the Doctrinall part to speak freely to your heads, and in the Practique to put it home to your hearts by the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Word contained in the holy lines of sacred Scripture, and in the power of the Spirit, according to the modell of that knowledge of God that he hath imparted unto me. The first piece of my Doctrinall part is thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the passages of this world are passing dangerous as a sea,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Resemblances.</note> proved and expressed in foure resemblances.</p>
            <p>First, in respect that this world (as the sea) is subject to sundry and frequent stormes. You all know what stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming is; It is grown a Military terme, Such a City, Town, Cittadell, and Castle was stormed.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Daniels</hi> Vision shews it; <hi>Daniel spake, and said, I saw</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan. 7. 2.</note>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:101551:6"/>
               <hi>in my vision by night, and behold, the foure winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea.</hi> That is to say,</p>
            <p>1. The South wind of prosperity. What is there any storme in that? Oh how many and mighty puft up with the pomp of this world doe <hi>forget God,</hi> and <hi>have their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the wicked,</hi> who <hi>shall be turned into hell,</hi> and with them <hi>all the people that forget God!</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 9. 17.</note>
            </p>
            <p>2. The storme of adversity caused by the North-wind of affliction, deeps and distresses, oh how many and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath that wind sunk! Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> was accustomed to say to such as came unto him for advise, support, and counsell in severall disgusts of conscience: Assuredly my friends, through hoping and despairing, the sonnes and<note place="margin">Sperando, &amp; desperando, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sere<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> pereunt homines: Sperando male in vita, despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rando pejus in morte.</note> daughters of men doe miserably perish; by hoping foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly and cursedly all their life, that all shall be wel with them, albeit they walk in the stubbornnesse of their own hearts, against all the blessed means, and motions of Gods blessed Word and Spirit; and despairing like hel-hounds in the end of their dayes.</p>
            <p>3. There may come a storme out of the East, neither good for man nor beast, and yet may be an especiall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration of some common grace. Christ hath pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a blessing to <hi>the pure in heart, for they shall see God:</hi> O<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 8.</note> blessed Puritanes! They doe see God already in his Works and Word, and shall see him hereafter in a beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical vision. But what say you to this of the Wiseman in his Proverbs, <hi>There is a generation pure in their owne conceit;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 31. 12.</note> 
               <hi>and yet are not purged, and purified from their wickednesse?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Yea the case may so fal out, that all the rest of the winds may breathe fairely, and yet on a sudden a black cloud, and storm may appeare out of the West, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set all. In briefe, a Disgust may arise out of all the 32. points of the Seamans Compasse and Chard, and ruine us
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101551:6"/>
in this sea of the world, in a trice, be we never so concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of our safety and assurance.</p>
            <p>The second passage is, <hi>That this sea of the world is very,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2.</note> 
               <hi>and passing dangerous, in respect of the many, and manifold rocks, shelves, syrtes, and sands that lye hid, and covered in the Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Divine shewes you a map of this world, &amp; points to it, saying, <hi>All that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 16.</note> 
               <hi>lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but of the world.</hi> What, all things in this world? Yea all. <hi>Behold, I will shew a truth.</hi> The Astronomers conceit, that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens are turned upon the two Poles, to wit, the Artique, and Antartique Poles. I admire not their conceit, this I am sure I know, and we all here are experienced in, that all the actions, affections, &amp; imaginations of the thoughts of all men and women tend either to profit, or pleasure, or both. Oh how many for these ends and purposes have runne themselves upon the rocks of witlesse and worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse security! Others upon the shelves of proud and Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciferian presumption have ruinated themselves. Others have sunk themselves and theirs upon the syrtes &amp; sands of miserable Desperation.</p>
            <p>The third passage is, <hi>That the sea of this world is passing</hi>
               <note place="margin">3.</note> 
               <hi>dangerous in respect of the many sea monsters that are in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> saw this in his Vision. <hi>And foure</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan. 7. 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> 
               <hi>great beasts came up from the sea, divers one from another. The first was like a lyon,</hi> which are the proud, knowne and discovered by their high looks, lofty words, and stroting incesse. <hi>The second was like a Beare,</hi> which are the volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and filthy uncleane persons, men and women. The Beare licks his dirty pawes, and the strumpet wipes her mouth, and licks her whorish lips, and saith, <hi>I have done no evill,</hi> when she hath sold her soule to the devil, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101551:7"/>
sunk her body into a gulfe of uncleannesse. <hi>The third beast was like a Leopard,</hi> a mongrell beast comming of a Lion and a Pard, and this is the covetous wretch, who being neither fish, nor flesh, nor good red-herring, neither good to God, nor to man, nor to himselfe. The fourth beast is not named, but deciphered to have <hi>teeth of iron.</hi> This is no other beast, but hellish and diabolicall malice, which rends, teares, and tyrannizes over the proud Peacocks, the stinking voluptuous Beare, and the amphibious Leopard.</p>
            <p>The fourth passage is, <hi>That the Sea of this world is passing</hi>
               <note place="margin">4.</note> 
               <hi>dangerous in respect of the inconstancie thereof.</hi> Sometimes in siraquedry and excesse, lifting worldlings up to heaven upon her billowes, and anon <hi>sinking them downe</hi> (as it<note place="margin">Psal. 107 27.</note> were) <hi>to hell,</hi> as the holy Psalmist tells you.</p>
            <p>The Philosophers tell us, that the Moone is Mistris of<note place="margin">Tantum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stans in <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate sua.</note> the Sea, and the Moone is ever constant in her continued inconstancie. The Moone never shineth long with one and the same countenance, but still she is either in her wane, or in her increment. Ay me! how fit a semblance is this Moon a Mistris of the Sea; and the inconstancie of the Sea and Moon an absolute Demonstration of this Sea of slippery and brittle glasse? Thus have we made good the fitnesse of the Resemblance, That the Sea of this world is passing dangerous in foure respects: Namely, by reason it is subject to every disgust of the ayre, blow the wind out of what quarter you will. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, dangerous, in respect of the many rocks, shelves, syrtes, and sands. Thirdly, dangerous, in respect of Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monsters: And fourthly, dangerous, in respect of this worlds constant inconstancie.</p>
            <p>The second piece of the Doctrinall part of my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position<note place="margin">2.</note> is this, <hi>That all the passages in this world are ever transitory, and alwayes fleeting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:101551:7"/>The holy Divine St. <hi>John</hi> is very plaine, and passing peremptory in this, <hi>The world passeth away and the lust there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 17.</note> 
               <hi>but he that doth the will of the Lord, abideth ever.</hi> We all know, that we are all in passage; the world is either lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us, or we the world; peradventure this night, who can tell how soon this voice may be heard at your cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber window: <hi>Thou foole, this night shall they snatch thy soule from thee; whose are those things then that thou possessest</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 12. 17.</note> 
               <hi>now?</hi> If not to night, yet the wise man tells you, <hi>They have wings,</hi> and askes you this question, <hi>Wilt thou set thy hears</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 23. 5.</note> 
               <hi>upon that which is not? For riches take unto them wings, and flye away. Jeremy</hi> tells the Muck-worme, that he is <hi>like the foolish Partridge, which sits abrood on egges, and never</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 17. 11.</note> 
               <hi>hatcheth them:</hi> So the fond worldlings have riches, and enjoy them not. And the holy Psalmist burnes the foolish worldling in the fore-head with a <hi>Behold the man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 52. 7.</note> 
               <hi>who tooke not God for his strength;</hi> but <hi>boasted</hi> and <hi>blest</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe <hi>in the multitude of his riches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third piece of my Proposition is this, <hi>That all the</hi>
               <note place="margin">3.</note> 
               <hi>passages of this world are never satisfactory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They that drinke Sea-water, doe never quench their thirst, but are dry and thirsty still. Whose eye was ever satisfied with seeing? whose eare with hearing? whose scent with smelling? whose mouth with eating? Men may satiate their senses, but never satisfie them. The Prodigall was not satisfied with his revelling &amp; excesse, though he brought his noble to nine pence, and his nine pence to nothing. The Scholler is never satisfied with his knowledge. He that encreaseth his doctrine, encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth<note place="margin">Eccles. 1. 18.</note> his dolour. Nor yet the honourable, either in the state Ecclesiasticall, or Civill. Nor the opulent man<note place="margin">Eccles. 5. 19.</note> with all his fulnesse. See the antiphony of those that have nothing, and those that have too much: They both cry
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101551:8"/>
out, O what shall we doe? So cryed the foole in the<note place="margin">Luk. 12.</note> Gospel, when his increase was bigger then his barne. And so complained the poore Prodigall, when hee had not one Denier to help himself withall; if he had not had a good Father to goe unto, and remembred him at last cast, the poore starveling had eaten husks with Swine, and pitifully perished.</p>
            <p>The fourth and last piece of the Doctrinall part of my<note place="margin">4.</note> Proposition, is this, <hi>That all the passages of this world are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes open, overt, obvious, and transparent to God with whom we have to doe.</hi> The sweet Singer of <hi>Israel</hi> expostulates this truth with his God; <hi>Whither shall I goe from thy Spirit?</hi> or thy presence? <hi>If to heaven, thou art there</hi> in thy display<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed glory: <hi>If to hell, thou art there also</hi> in thy judgements<note place="margin">Psal. 139. 8.</note> on the wicked in torments: <hi>If to Sea, thine hand must guide me there too.</hi> If I thinke the darknesse shall hide me; the darke night to God is as cleere as the brightest day. The<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 13.</note> Spirit of God tells you; That <hi>there is no creature that is not manifest to his sight, and all things are open and naked to him with whom we have to doe.</hi> And the Book of the <hi>Revelation</hi> of Jesus Christ, sayes, That Gods eyes, like flaming fire,<note place="margin">Revel. 1. 14.</note> run to and fro thorow all the world. This last piece of the doctrinall part of my Proposition, as it is a terrour and trembling to the wicked, all whose cursed and crying wickednesses are open to his all-seeing eyes: so it is a cordiall and comfort to the godly, knowing and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that their heavenly Father seeth and beholdeth all their pressures, vexations, and distresses that they endure, and lye under in this slippery, brittle, and boisterous Sea of the world.</p>
            <p>Would you know the reasons of these particular truths?<note place="margin">Reasons.</note> As first, why the passages of this world are so dangerous? The reasons are ready. It is because the raging Sea is
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101551:8"/>
not subject to so many disgusts, either of dangerous rockes, stormes, shelves, shallowes, syrtes, sands, Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monsters, and other incumbrances, as this restlesse world is, that is fraught with dangers and incarnate divels.</p>
            <p>What find we here but brevity in all our Contents? as the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> Evangelizeth: <hi>It is even as when a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esa. 29. 8.</note> 
               <hi>man dreameth, and behold he eateth; but he awaketh, and his soule is empty: Or as when a thirsty man dreameth, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, he drinketh; but he awaketh, and his soule is faint.</hi> Oh how many are there in this Sea of glasse, whose whole course of life is but a dreame, and when death comes, they are awakened, and never till then in all their life, and their soules are empty of all comfort, and fainting, dye, and their places<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>know them no more!</p>
            <p>What finde we here but levity? the very wicked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse as much, saying, We have wearied our selves in the wayes of wickednesse, and the wayes of the Lord wee have been strangers to.</p>
            <p>What finde wee here but Cymmerian blindenesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> millions selling away their interest to Heaven for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing?</p>
            <p>What find we here, but multitude and vast magnitude of all sorts of iniquities, transgressions, and sinnes? God himselfe complaining by his Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> with a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: <hi>Behold,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>I am pressed under you, as a</hi>
               <note place="margin">Amos 2. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Cart is pressed that is full of sheaves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VVhat meet we here daily but with deceitfulnesse on all hands? the world it selfe is all glasse, and where it glittereth most, there it cracketh and breaketh soonest.</p>
            <p>VVhat doe we finde the world to be in our experience of it, but a bitter pill candyed over with sugar? a golden cup like the whores in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> full of dismall and<note place="margin">Revel. 17. 4.</note> deadly poyson? No marvell then that the Prophets,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101551:9"/>
Princes, and Preachers of the world have left behinde them such lamentable notes and votes of their weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somnesse in the experience of things here below. <hi>Jeremy</hi> that Prophet of <hi>Lamentations</hi> cryeth, <hi>Oh that mine head were a well of waters, and mine eyes a fountaine of teares, that I might weepe day and night for the slaine of the Daughter of my people! O that I had in the wildernesse a lodging place of waifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring men, that I might leave my people, and goe from them, for they be all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men!</hi> I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend<note place="margin">Jer. 9. 1, 2.</note> the whole chapter to the reading and meditation of every sober Christian, to fit his soule, and tune his heart to the wofull tone of this tumultuous Sea-world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> a King tunes his pipes with this dolefull Ditty, <hi>O that I had wings like a Dove! for then would I flee away, and be at rest. Loe then would I wander farre of, and remaine in the</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 55. 6.</note> 
               <hi>wildernesse. I would hasten mine escape from this worlds windy storme and tempest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paul</hi> the Preacher of the Gentiles exclaimes and sayes, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from this body</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 24.</note> 
               <hi>of death!</hi> And had he not found a deliverer, he had sunk under that bitter agony.</p>
            <p>You will further enquire, Why the passages of this<note place="margin">2.</note> world are ever so transitory, and brittle? I answer brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, This fretfull Sea of glasse is like an angry Lady, that will turne away her servant for a very Glasse brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</p>
            <p>And why are they never satisfactory? For that the<note place="margin">3.</note> heart of man is a triangle, and the world is a circle, and a circle can never fill a triangle. Nothing in this world can satisfie mans triangle heart but the holy, blessed, and glorious Trinity. One touch of the Power of God the Father; one glimpse of the rayes of the wisdome of God the Sonne, in whom are hid all the Treasures of wisdome
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101551:9"/>
and knowledge; and one drop of the gift and grace of charity from God the Holy Ghost satisfies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, and cheeres the whole nature of the regenerate man.</p>
            <p>But why are all the passages of this world alwayes<note place="margin">4.</note> open and overt to the sight and censure of the eternall God? How can it be otherwise? It is impossible but that he that made the eye should see: Shall not he that made the heart, shall not he, I say, understand? When the whole world before his Throne is Crystalline, open, naked, and diaphanous to the Lord our God. His all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing eyes see, and discerne the imaginations of the<note place="margin">Gen. 6. 6.</note> thoughts of every mans heart that liveth.</p>
            <p>Shall I request this favour at your hands? That you would be pleased to turne to the first chapter of <hi>Johns</hi> Gospel, and read from the 45. v. to the end of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and observe and meditate of that heavenly confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there between Jesus Christ our blessed Saviour, <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Bethsaida,</hi> and <hi>Nathanael; Philip findeth Natha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, and saith unto him, Wee have found the Messias: Come and see. Jesus saw Nathanael comming unto him, and said, Behold a true Israelite, in whom is no guile. Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee when thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee. Nathanael</hi> is ravished and cryes out, <hi>Rabbi, Thou art the Sonne of God, thou art the King of Israel.</hi> Many there knew <hi>Nathanael</hi> to be an Israelite, but none saving the Lord Jesus knew him to be such an Israelite in whom was no guile.</p>
            <p>Thus farre have I spoken unto your heads in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinall part of my Proposition; Give me now leave to speake to your hearts in the practick part thereof, and so I shall incline toward an end.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:101551:10"/>The first Use of the Doctrine, is of heavenly affection,<note place="margin">The practise. 1.</note> tending to earnestnesse of zeale, and longing after Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; Forasmuch as we finde nothing here below but a Sea restlesse, a brittle being, and a slippery standing.</p>
            <p>What are we? or who are we here present this day, and understanding what the frame, fashion, and garbe of this world is by the sacred Oracle of the text, and would not now cry out with <hi>Esay</hi> to our God in Heaven, <hi>Oh that thou wouldest rend the Heavens, that thou wouldest come downe, that</hi>

               <hi>the Mountaines might melt at thy presence,</hi> and that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions might tremble at thy power? What are mountaines here, but the mighty in the earth, that set themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Lord? <hi>Bow thy Heavens, O Lord, and come down:</hi>

Yea, though a rebellious <hi>Absolon</hi> that had swelled against his Father like to an <hi>Olympus,</hi> God commeth down in his power, and gives him but a touch, and he and his haughty Rebellion passeth away in a smoake that vanisheth; hee hangs between heaven and earth, as unworthy of either, and all his swelling presently abates like a blown bladder with the pricke of a pin.</p>
            <p>1. To my Brethren of the Ministry here present, I speak and beseech you to preach to this decaying world, That we all in it wax old as doth a garment, and as a vesture God wil change us, and we shall be changed; but he is the<note place="margin">Psal. 102, 26.</note> same, yesterday, to day, and for ever, and his yeers shall<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 8.</note> have no end.</p>
            <p>2. To the Laicks I say this, It is an observation of the Physicians, that we are now of shorter stature, and of lesse livelihood then heretofore.</p>
            <p>3. Is there an Astronomer here? tell him that <hi>Stadius,</hi>

            <p>4. Art thou a Muck-worme? Know that <hi>Philip Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthon</hi> a choice Divine in his time, being contemporary with <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> left this observation behinde him, That the earth is growne so old, that it is like a wombe barren with age.</p>
            <p>5. To whomsoever here present, that hath any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian sense and feeling, I would have him know, that the whole Creation groaneth, and travaileth in paine toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther untill now. And not onely they, but wee our selves which have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we our selves<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 22, 23.</note> groane within our selves, waiting for our full and finall redemption, as <hi>Paul</hi> preacheth.</p>
            <p>6. Haply there may bee here present some Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite, or Jesuited spirit, whose learning lyes all in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectories of <hi>Machiavels Prince, Bodins Commentaries,</hi> and <hi>Lypsius Politiques,</hi> whose Primer is couched in this one prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, <hi>Religentem esse oportet, religiosum nefas:</hi> Let me tell that Statizer, I am no <hi>Platonist,</hi> whose learning is hid in finall and fatall numbers; affirming, that no State ever conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued above 500. yeeres, without some fearefull fate or finall fall.

even the Prophet <hi>Daniels</hi> interpretation of <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zars</hi> vision in a Dreame. The Vision was this: An I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage appeared to the King, whose <hi>head was of fine gold, his</hi>

               <hi>breasts and armes of silver, his belly and thighes of brasse, his legges of iron, and his feet part of iron and part of clay.</hi> This head of fine gold, breasts and armes of silver, belly and thighes of brasse, legges of iron, and the feet part of iron and part of clay, were the four Monarchies of this world, this glassie Sea, like Crystall. The head of fine gold was the Monarchy of the <hi>Assyrians</hi> and <hi>Babylonians.</hi> The breasts and armes of silver, were the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians.</hi> The belly and thighes of brasse signified the Monarchy of the <hi>Greekes</hi> and <hi>Macedonians:</hi> And the legges of iron, and the feet partly of iron and partly of clay, pourtray unto us the last Monarchy of the <hi>Romanes</hi> and <hi>Germanes.</hi> The three first Monarchies, to wit, of the <hi>Assyrians</hi> and <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians, Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians, Graecians</hi> and <hi>Macedonians,</hi> are long agoe slipt away in this slippery and brittle world: And the last of the <hi>Romanes</hi> and <hi>Germanes</hi> is now at a very low ebbe; for it is come to a titular Emperour, and that is all that remaines of the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> and at this very day ready to return to their prime and pristine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement, to be <hi>Comites de Kyburgh;</hi> onely the proud <hi>Spaniard</hi> ventures at all to uphold their tottering state and low condition.</p>
            <p>Assuredly no expectation at all remaineth, but when the stone hewed out of the rocke of our sinnes shall fall upon the remaining stumps, and then downe falls all the Gold, Silver, Brasse and Iron upon the feet of clay, and so then, this Sea of Glasse <hi>in Chaos antiquum confun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And verily, my Prayer is, and shall be this, Come Lord Jesus, come quickly, and stretch out thine hand, close up
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101551:11"/>
the two eyes of this dying world, the Sun and the Moon, that we may attain that heavenly Jerusalem, where theres no need of either, but the glory of the Lamb of God, the Lord Jesus, shal be our exceeding glorious recompence of reward for ever.</p>
            <p>The second Use of the Doctrine is mournfull, sad, and<note place="margin">2.</note> sable, even of lamentation, for the witlesse wights of this glassie brittle seas inhabitants.</p>
            <p>Oh how many sots are there in this restlesse sea of the world, who albeit they see, and may discern this truth in a vision, and revelation of Jesus, yet think of nothing, but seek here for their content, and care for nothing but here to finde their <hi>Requiem</hi> for their soules! Behold (bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the Lord) their extreame folly. Some seek, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive hope that they shall find it in the lust, and brutish lustfulnesse of the flesh: and what is that, but the foame of this sea? and what tends it to, and ends in, but fordid lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xurie, which brings us to rottennesse, pox, and penurie? This foame dwels in drunkennesse, vomit, and spewing, in riot and excesse, which ends in filthy annihilation, fit for the draft-house, and nothing else. Others seek their <hi>Requiem</hi> in this restlesse sea, in the lust of the eyes, which is riches, and the pomp of the world, which the Scripture cals <hi>Phantasie.</hi> When King <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Bernice</hi> his wife<note place="margin">Acts 25. 23.</note> came in to hear <hi>Paul,</hi> the Greek speaks thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, What are these but <hi>Conchyliamaris,</hi> the shels of this glassie sea, which doe weary us in seeking them, befoole us in the possession of them, and vex us to the heart when we must part with them? Others seek their <hi>Requiem</hi> in the pride of life; and what are all the pleasures of this life, but the billowes of this sea of glasse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherewith some are lifted up to vain glory? that feather, which children and fooles labour to catch in the streets, and abundantly sweat
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101551:12"/>
for it, and know not what to doe with it when they have it, but set it flying again. Others it lifteth up to Honours; and yet his Lordship must say to rottennesse, <hi>Thou art my father and mother,</hi> and to the wormes, not of the earth, for they scorne to come nigh thee, but to thine owne skin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms, (as <hi>Job</hi> speaks) <hi>You are my brothers and sisters.</hi> Some<note place="margin">Job 17. 14.</note> are lifted up on the billowes of their policie and learning, whereas we know that the prudent and politique dye as well as the ignorant and foolish. Others are lifted up up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the billowes of their beauty, which with a gleame of the Sun will be burnt, with three fits of a Spanish Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will be discoloured, with old age furrowed with wrinkles, and with three dayes of death made hideous. Others pride themselves in their gay garments, which every week grow out of fashion, as the world it self doth. Is it not a strange thing that a Malefactor should be proud of his halter that must hang him? Surely our clothes may put us in mind of our evil doing; for had we not faln from God by our evil doing, we had had no use of raiment. In a word, what are all our pleasures, but <hi>Lilia terrae,</hi> like the Lilies of the field? what gold and silver, but <hi>Ilia terrae,</hi> the garbage of the earth? and what are honours and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, but <hi>Ludibria venti,</hi> feathers for the wind to play withall?</p>
            <p>The third Use of this Doctrine is of Expostulation.<note place="margin">3.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Have, and doe we not too too often forget where we are? verily we have, and doe so still. Ay me! we little consider that we are poore passengers in this sea of glasse; we are in this world, and this world is a sea of glasse, rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse as a sea, and brittle as glasse: our Port and Haven is Heaven, every one of us is his owne Pilot to guide his own vessel. The Pilots place is to sit in the sterne of his ship: Why there? To see how she steeres. That true Christian
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101551:12"/>
Passenger that sailes towards heaven, will ever be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his end, sitting in the sterne, and considers how his Ship steeres toward the Haven of Heaven. Never do any saile in safety in this restlesse world, but they that in their voyage have the Rudder in their hand, and the Compasse and Sea-Card in their eye, that is to say, think and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate of their end, and steere toward heaven.</p>
            <p>The fourth Use of this Doctrine is of holy Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.<note place="margin">4.</note>
            </p>
            <p>What is that? Surely to resolve as the holy Divine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viseth, <hi>Not to love the world;</hi> for if we doe, <hi>the love of God is not in us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Can any man love a traiterous and treacherous <hi>Judas,</hi> which (if you confide in him) will betray you with a kisse? And if the world smile upon you, take heed, lest the next thing you heare of, be not some plot of villany to insnare thee. Can any wise man love the place where Satan domineeres? <hi>If this our Gospel</hi> truth <hi>be hid</hi> from any here, <hi>it is hid to them that are lost.</hi> Are not they lost that can<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> neither be found in heaven, nor in the earth, nor yet in the sea? <hi>The god of this world,</hi> which is the Devil, <hi>hath blinded the minds of them that beleeve not</hi> this truth, <hi>lest the light of the glorious Gospel</hi> truth <hi>of Jesus Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them. The whole world,</hi> saith the holy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Saint <hi>John, lyeth in wickednesse;</hi> and our little world,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> this Island wherein we dwell, is on fire about our eares, and yet neither the worlds malignity, nor yet our owne misery, can quicken us to a lothing of this restlesse and brittle sea of glasse.</p>
            <p>But would you learne how to avoid this Traitor that wil Judaize with you, this dominion of Satan, and this house on fire? I shall doe my endeavour to satisfie your desire in this point.</p>
            <p>You all know, that whatsoever the shavelings of Rome
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101551:13"/>
say, we have a Church, and it is a principall piece of the holy Catholique Church, which we professe to beleeve, that is scattered farre and wide upon the surface of the whole Universe; and to this Church we have given our names. <hi>Christian</hi> is my name, and <hi>Catholike</hi> is my sirname. We are shipped by Baptisme: If a tempest arise, cry up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Christ, as the Apostles did, in a storme. If the Ship of our state be ready to be swallowed up of the waves, flye unto Christ, if he be asleep, awaken him with our cryes. <hi>Concutitur fides, non excutitur;</hi> our faith may bee shaken, but never shaken off: therefore never cease, but cry, and cry aloud that we may be heard, and being heard we may be delivered; and being delivered we may glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God. If the wind roare, Christ will rebuke it, and there shall follow a great calme.</p>
            <p>The fift Use of the Doctrine is to take a review of the<note place="margin">5.</note> Text.</p>
            <p>If this world be in experience to us a Sea of glasse like unto Crystall; This Crystalline resemblance deceives none but children and fooles, who are deceived with shewes, shadowes, and resemblances: But wee are men endowed with reason and experience. How are we fitted and furnished for our voyage? Where's our Tackles? Have we our Maine mast ready, that is to say, our faith,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 6.</note> without which it is impossible to please God? there's no walking or talking with God without it. Where's our Anchor and Sailes, the Anchor of hope, and the Sayles of good workes? What wind doe we sayle by? no wind under the cope of heaven, but the gale of Christian Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity can arrive us at the Port of Heaven: But sayling with that gentle gale, we need not feare any danger between this and Heaven: For if a Whale by the way should swallow us, as it did <hi>Jonah;</hi> or a wind called <hi>Euroclydon,</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:101551:13"/>
which caused <hi>Pauls</hi> ship-wracke, at the Island then called <hi>Melita,</hi> now <hi>Malta.</hi> In both dangers we should be safe, the Whale must cast us upon the Land, and though the Ship were wracked, yet either by swimming, or by some broken fragments of the Ship we should surely come safe to Land.</p>
            <p>The sixt use of this Doctrine, is of Discovery.</p>
            <p>The holy Apostle gives every one in particular a Christian Caveat, <hi>Let him that standeth, take heed lest he fall.</hi> If my Text be a vision unto you, it hath discovered how slippery our station is: I beseech you therefore, when you have forgotten me, yet remember my Text, and forget it not lest you slippe, and slide, and fall, like the house built upon the sands, the fall whereof was great.</p>
            <p>The Royall Preacher tells us, that God hath set the<note place="margin">Eccles. 3. 11.</note> world in the heart of man, to the end that he should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the deceitfulnesse and uncertainty of it. Shall a man love that which Christ never prayed for? I pray for mine Elect, I pray not for the world: That is, I pray<note place="margin">Joh. 17. 9.</note> not for the Muck-worms and Mammonists of this world. And if the grace of God be in us, we shall daily blesse and thank God for the Lord Jesus, who hath given himselfe for our sinnes, that hee might deliver us from this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent evill world, according to the will of God and our<note place="margin">Gal. 1. 3, 4.</note> Father.</p>
            <p>They that remember not this discovery of the world, have not knowne God, as <hi>John</hi> testifieth. The Mammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists<note place="margin">Jo. 17. 25<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> of this world cannot endure to heare or thinke of death, and yet when they lose the things of this glassie world, they murther themselves with worldly sorry: St. <hi>Paul</hi> is a witnesse of this truth, saying, The sorrow of<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 1.</note> this world causeth death. The Mammonists and Muck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wormes
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101551:14"/>
of this world brag, boast, and pride themselves with the things of the world. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was otherwise minded; <hi>God forbid</hi> (saith he) <hi>that I should pride my selfe in</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 14.</note> ought or <hi>any thing in the world, save in the Crosse of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is no marvell that so few love Preachers, and gaine so little or nothing by the frequent and powerfull prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of Gospell-truth. <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth us the reason<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 10.</note> why <hi>Demas</hi> forsooke him, <hi>Hee was in love with this present world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Peter</hi> gives the Muck wormes, Mammonists, and lovers of this world their fearfull, fatall, and finall doom,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 20.</note> shewing first how we may escape the pollutions of this world; and then how dangerous a relapse and backsli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is: For, saith he, and puts the case thus; If the Muck-wormes and Mammonists of this world have esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are againe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 20.</note> therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them then the beginning; for then they become Wells without water, Clouds that are carried with a tempest, to whom the mist of darknesse is reserved for ever. For the Lord Christ Jesus sake (blessed Auditory, you holy people of the Lord) remember my Text when you see not me, That our standing is very slippery upon this Sea of glasse. Remember that all the actions, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, and all the imaginations of all the thoughts, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses and intentions of all hearts are before the Throne of God open and manifest to his sight and censure. The Lords Throne is in heaven. His eyes behold, his eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids try the children of men. <hi>The Lord tryeth the righteous, but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soule hateth.</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:101551:14"/>
Oh remember that <hi>the Lords Throne is for ever;</hi> and that <hi>his Throne is in heaven, and the earth is his pedestoole.</hi> Oh remember that thou <hi>sweare not by heaven, for it is the Throne of God:</hi> For hee that <hi>sweareth by heaven, sweareth by the Throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon.</hi> Oh remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that <hi>we must all appeare before the Throne of Jesus Christ, and render our accompts.</hi> Oh remember what favour the Lord Jesus hath purchased for us, that <hi>we may come boldly to a Throne of grace, and obtaine mercy, and finde grace to helpe in time of need.</hi> Oh remember what the Lord Jesus hath promised, even that <hi>his Saints on earth sit with him in his Throne in heaven, even as he is sate downe with his Father in his Throne,</hi> Psal. 11. 4.

            <p>The seventh and last Vse of the Doctrine is of motion, and we need not seeke farre for a perswading and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing motive, when we may but cast our eye aside, and looke upon this present and emergent occasion, which is both sad and sorrowfull, even the decease of a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy servant to the Lord Jesus, whose sad Elegy I shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to couch in as few words, as a passage of such moment may be epilogized in, yet I hope so much as may awaken and stirre us up to consider where wee are, and what our condition is here, unlesse it be so with some of us, that we are asleep in death, and will not be moved nor removed from our brutish slumber for whatsoever may be said or done.</p>
            <p>I confesse indeed, that this taske had been fit to have been undertaken by some strong, young, and skilfull
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101551:15"/>
Champion of the Church, and not imposed upon an old, weake one, an <hi>Emeritus miles,</hi> and almost a <hi>Silicernium,</hi> a man <hi>merè Edentulus,</hi> one so farre from eloquence, that hath not so much as Elocution: But <hi>cum nemini obtrudi potest, itur ad me,</hi> when I had not thirty houres time to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare my selfe to the businesse; yet rather then I would wave the memoriall of mine endeared friend, I resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to undergo the censure of the judicious for my plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and simplicity.</p>
            <p>Truly I could willingly take up the lamentable cry of <hi>Elisha</hi> for <hi>Eliah,</hi> He crying, <hi>O my Father, my Father;</hi> and I lamenting, <hi>Oh my Brother, my Brother,</hi> the Chariots of <hi>Israel</hi> and the horse-men of the same; for we have lost a chiefe Chariot of our Churches, and an Horse-man of the State, not of the Pike, but of the Pen: But why should I, or any lament for him? of whom I may say to you all that Distick which old <hi>Ennius</hi> said at his death, and that with a very little alteration:
<q>Nemo illum lachrymis decoret, neque funera fletu Faxit. Cur? volitat docta per ora virum.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I beseech you therefore have a little patience, and I shall onely speake of two passages: First, of his Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an living amongst us, and then of his sweet leaving of us.</p>
            <p>1. He was an Academique by birth, he was borne of<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Charlton</hi> upon <hi>Otmore.</hi>
               </note> honest parents within three miles of <hi>Oxenford,</hi> that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mistris of Universities. His breeding up was also there, in <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> Colledge, an happy Seminary of very many famous and learned men; I mention one for all, that is Doctor <hi>John Reinolds,</hi> whom I have heard stiled beyond the Sea in the Universities of <hi>Rostochium,</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:101551:15"/>
               <hi>Grominga</hi> and <hi>Leidon,</hi> thus, <hi>That famous Oxford of Learning, worthy Dr. Reinolds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. As he grew up in yeeres, he lived in favour with God and man in an unreproveable holy life and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, honoured for Arts and Sciences, and had all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees that the University doth afford, conferred upon him, <hi>Ex merito &amp; congrul, &amp; condigni,</hi> both for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity of good manners, and condignity of singular know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <p>3. He was commended for a Chaplaine to the Lord <hi>Edmonds,</hi> Leiger Legat, Lord Ambassadour for his sacred Majesty to the French King, where being at <hi>Paris</hi> he dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Jesuites, who albeit they contemned him for that he was of so low a stature, yet admired him for his ready answers, and acute distinctions: The Jesuites in that contempt of theirs had forgot what that ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Jerome</hi> said of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> That although he was of a very little and low stature, yet for all that, that <hi>Homo tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubitalis ascendit in coelum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Some seven yeeres sithence I had a son Fellow of <hi>Trinity</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> who, being Traveller for his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, I kept at <hi>Paris</hi> for a time, <hi>habitu dementissimo,</hi> in an uncouth habit, that he might not be knowne, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorted daily, and had conference in the Cleremont with the Jesuites, and with them of the Colledge of <hi>Sorbon,</hi> but more intimately with <hi>Sirmundus</hi> and <hi>Petavius</hi> two prime Jesuites, whom (as hee hath told mee) remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred Doctor <hi>Featley</hi> oft-times in their conference with reverentiall respect for his accute and ready Disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>5. All his Sermons in a great Book in Folio shew how sound he was at heart, and discovereth the plots of the Romish Sectaries in abundant manner. He also made a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101551:16"/>
Supplement to that worthy Knight Sir <hi>Humphrey Linde</hi> his Book, which he left unfinished at his death, and vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated that worthy Knight from the scandals and aspersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that Romish railing <hi>Rabshakeh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. He writ against <hi>Arminius,</hi> and all of his rabble, shewing demonstratively that their Tenets they had from the patches and pieces of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> that Welch Heretique, a Monke of <hi>Bangor,</hi> whose name was <hi>Morgan;</hi> for <hi>Pelagius</hi> in Latine and <hi>Morgan</hi> in the Welch Idiome signifie both one and the same party, that is to say, <hi>Mor-gan. Mor,</hi> is <hi>more,</hi> and <hi>gan,</hi> is <hi>juxta mare,</hi> or <hi>Accola maris:</hi> One of the Shires of South-Wales being called <hi>La Morganshire,</hi> for that it is scituate all along the Sea coast.</p>
            <p>7. He wrote a little Tract called <hi>The Sea-Gull,</hi> against a grosse imposture, and shewed it me in <hi>Peter-house,</hi> what time I came to visit him there, with Sir <hi>Geo: Sands,</hi> Knight, my Countryman of Kent, with others.</p>
            <p>8. He wrote a little before his death against the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>In</hi> Peter-house <hi>Entituled,</hi> The Dippers dipt, <hi>sold by</hi> Rich: Royston <hi>in</hi> Ivic-lanc.</note> (a book seasonable &amp; necessary for these unset<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, wanton times) and in the very frontispice of that Book discovereth fifteen species of them.</p>
            <p>9. After his returne out of <hi>France,</hi> he was recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the University of <hi>Oxford,</hi> to Doctor <hi>Abbots,</hi> chiefe in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to be his Chaplaine; where he loitered not, neither ceased to write against <hi>Rome,</hi> as often as ought did peepe out of the Presse of the whore of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylons trash. Neither was his learning onely Polemicall, but pious also, as his <hi>Meditations,</hi> and <hi>Hand maid to Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> doe witnesse: and in that time he was Chaplaine, he was the meanes under God of the conversion of a Spanish Frier.</p>
            <p>10. His nature was meek, gracious, affable, merciful, as appeared in his sincerity toward the poore, when as he
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101551:16"/>
and I had the honour with Doctor <hi>Temple,</hi> Doctor <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> Master <hi>Francis Taylor,</hi> and others, to be returned &amp; joyned in the Commission for pioususes, with worthy Sir <hi>John Lenthall,</hi> Knight, and other Justices of <hi>Surry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>11. His intimate acquaintance and mine were of thirty seven yeeres duration; and one and twenty yeers of which time we lived loving friends and neighbours but 3. miles distant from one another.</p>
            <p>12. We served together in three Convocations, to wit, the last two of King <hi>James</hi> of precious memory, to whom we had the honour to be Chaplaines in Ordinary, and the first of King <hi>Charles</hi> kept at <hi>Oxford:</hi> All which time he strongly set himselfe against all that had any smack of <hi>Rome,</hi> or Romish superstition.</p>
            <p>13. In which Convocations, five and forty of us, whereof he was chiefe, made a solemn Covenant among our selves to oppose every thing that did but savour or scent never so little of Pelagianisme, or Semi-Pelagia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme. And being elected by the Clergie of <hi>Surrey</hi> for to be a Clerk of the Convocation for this present Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and hearing me make Protestation in the face of that Clergie, (an occasion being offered) in these terms, <hi>Atque odi ego Arminianismum ac Bellarminianismum,</hi> came and embraced me in his armes, and said, Well said good brother, I protest and will sweare the like.</p>
            <p>Ay me, much more might be said of his Christian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and carriage amongst us, but I hasten to his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian leaving of us.</p>
            <p>1. He was not idle, no not to his very end. After he came to <hi>Chelsey,</hi> by the favour and grace of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to take the ayre, for the cure of his infirmities, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorting unto him with a visit, found him very ill affected with the <hi>Asthma in saburra stomachi,</hi> and with the Dropsie,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101551:17"/>
which was on the left side of his face, and was falne into his left legge, insomuch as I perceiving that he spake with great shortnesse of breath, and much difficulty to utter his words in our conference, I requesting him to spare his speech, I related severall passages unto him, which hee much rejoyced in, and so it tooke up the rest of the time I then stayed with him.</p>
            <p>2. Within lesse then a weeke after this my visit of him there was a rumour spread, that he was distracted of his wits, which when I heard I hasted to him, as soone as he heard in his chamber that I was there, he speedily came downe to me into the Hall, where after embracings, as our manner was, we sat down and talked.</p>
            <p>Truly I durst not tell him what I heard concerning the rumour, but after a little pause he told me himselfe of it in this manner, Wot you what Brother, why, they say I am mad. Now <hi>absit,</hi> quoth I. He replyed, My case is like <hi>Sophocles</hi> the Tragedian, whose sonnes accused him for a mad man, and therefore by their law he by the sentences of the Judges, had his <hi>Quietus est,</hi> no more to trouble himselfe with the affaires of his state: Hereupon <hi>Sophocles</hi> that wrote Tragedies even to extreame age, recited to the Judges a Tragedy of his own making, which he had then in his hand, called <hi>Oedipus Coloneus,</hi> and asked the Judges after he had read it unto them, Whether that Tragedy did scent or savour any whit of madnesse or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction; Upon this question the Judges changed their mindes and judgements, and quit him from the accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his unworthy sonnes: So, sayes he, I shall leave such notes behind me, quoted in this time of my weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, for <hi>Nulla dies sine linea,</hi> no sober man will think or conceive to be the meditations of a mad man.</p>
            <p>3. But when I perceived that this rumour did some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101551:17"/>
affect him, I said, I hope Brother this false report need not trouble you awhit, it is usuall in this sorry world for worthy men to heare of evill, when they are most bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied in goodnesse. How was that most judicious and sound Divine Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> used by foolish <hi>Surius,</hi> and malitious <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who reported, that he dyed of the <hi>Pthiriasis,</hi> the lowsie evill, such as <hi>Herod</hi> dyed of, <hi>Act.</hi> 11. <hi>ult.</hi> when it was but an ordinary disease called the <hi>Phthisis,</hi> or <hi>Tis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick?</hi> How was <hi>Theodorus de Beza</hi> used, when it was repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>Beza</hi> was dead, and a little before his death, that he had revolted and falne back to <hi>Rome;</hi> yea, and a lying Libell, printed at <hi>Rome,</hi> flew into all parts of Christendom, intituled, <hi>Tota Geneva Catholizat.</hi> But <hi>Beza</hi> lived to answer that Pamphlet with a Treatise called <hi>Tota Roma Critizat Cretizatque:</hi> For <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Titus,</hi> cap. 1. sayes, <hi>The Cretians were alwayes lyars, evill beasts, slow bellies, &amp;c.</hi> and cited unto them the Greek verse out of one of their owne Poets, to manifest it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Yea, further, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> makes this verse Scripture, by his attestation in the words following after it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that is to say, this witnesse is true.</p>
            <p>4. Further, he told me that he was writing still, and I encouraged him with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Indeed the lively voyce in preaching moveth more, yet a mans writing teacheth more. For it gives a man leave to pause on it, and doth not strike the eares onely, and then away: Words have wings; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Writing reacheth those that are far off, words those that are neere: Words reach onely to them that are alive, writing to them that are unborne: He that speaketh, profiteth his owne congregation; but he that writeth, profiteth all: hee that speaketh, for an houre; but he that writeth, for ever. After this I depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101551:18"/>
from him, and saw him no more, for within six dayes after I heard he was dead, and by credentiall witnesses am assured, that he departed this life a sound and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Protestant, living and professing at end, That hee dyed in the Faith and Religion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> established by many Parliaments.</p>
            <p>5. Thus he ran this course, and was faithfull and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full unto death; and God, I make no doubt, hath washed his soule in the blood of the Lambe, and hath given him a Crowne of life, which shall never be taken from him; I leave him in the hands of his God, in whom hee ever beleeved, and ever carefully served. I now returne to the gentle Reader, and certifie thee, That he was ever the same man, never dismayed with paines taking, not unlike the Palme Timber, which never bendeth under never so great a lading, but riseth upward against it; and as the children of <hi>Israel</hi> shrunk not down under their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour howsoever it were increased: Wherefore all that knew him, gave glory to God, saying, <hi>Surely the Lord hath done great things for him, and by him.</hi> I doe not give him halfe his due, as they know that knew him; yet haply more, then every one that knew us both, doe or may think fit to be spoken of him, but truth is truth whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is the speaker, and of the abundance of the heart the mouth will utter, and the Pen will write howsoever it be taken. I hope I shall not seem absurd to any sober Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for in all I have spoken I yeeld nothing so to flesh and blood, neither have I stretched my selfe beyond his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, as the Apostle speaketh. Dr. <hi>Bucer</hi> called himselfe <hi>Pila fortunae,</hi> and surely this Doctor and I being together at <hi>Oxford</hi> of the Convocation house in the first Parl. of K. <hi>Charles,</hi> he falling sicke there, and he himselfe, and others his friends, verily conceiving, that his sicknesse had been
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:101551:18"/>
the Plague of Pestilence, his falling ill happening that very weeke wherein 5000. and diverse hundreds dyed in <hi>London;</hi> he was constrained to quit <hi>Oxford,</hi> and to goe for <hi>Lambeth:</hi> But how harshly and hardly he was used by a great man of the Church that shall be namelesse, <hi>Animus meminisse horret, luctuque refugit.</hi> For in a manner he was driven thence, and wee were constrained to get him an house, and two poore men travelled with him, the one of the one side, and the other on the other side did support and stay him up all the way, he travelling on foot pace, and so brought him home to <hi>Lambeth.</hi> When wee took our leave of him at <hi>Bullington</hi> greene, he said, <hi>Valete amici, nunc temporis ego, ut olim Bucerus sum pila Fortunae, quae non est omnibus una: Orate pro me, rege, lege, grege. Iterum valete in Domino Jesu:</hi> And so went on his journey, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Psalmist, <hi>Lord thou tellest my flittings, note these things in thy book, O Lord.</hi> And now the world being not worthy of him, and he weary of it, is translated into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but so, that as <hi>Elias</hi> being carried up in a fiery Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, did let fall his Mantle from him for <hi>Elisha's</hi> comfort and behoofe; So our <hi>Featley</hi> burning with zeale for <hi>Gods</hi> glory, and for the good of his Saints, hath left behinde him severall tokens of his Learning and love to divers Friends.</p>
            <p>Let God be honoured for lending his Church such choyce vessels, to carry abroad his Name, and to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish his Truth against all opposers, and surely he deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth of us to be had in everlasting remembrance.</p>
            <p>But now I call my selfe to my remembrance, let mee have your patience, and I shall relate one more which I had almost utterly forgot.

there were three of our own Country besides this Dr. <hi>Featley.</hi> The one was <hi>John Duns Scotus,</hi> born far in the North neere <hi>Scotland,</hi> whereupon his Antagonists called him Scot in scorne, conceiving that because his tongue did <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, therefore his head must needs <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: but they were marvellously mistaken, as it appeared to all the learned where he was knowne.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Alexander of Hales,</hi> (the most ancient School-man) was born in <hi>Glocestershire</hi> at a place which I well know, called <hi>Hales,</hi> neer the Town of <hi>Winchcomb</hi> and <hi>Sudley Castle,</hi> of old the inheritance of the <hi>Butlers,</hi> Earles of <hi>Ormond,</hi> and now the Mansion-house of the <hi>Brugges</hi> Lord <hi>Chandos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Johannes de Bacone</hi> was sometime Fellow of <hi>Merton</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and afterward of <hi>Brasen nose</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge there.</p>
            <p>Lastly, gentle Reader, give me leave now I have said what I had to say touching this emergent occasion, that I may conclude with thee.</p>
            <p>My Text is a Discovery on what manner of station we stand upon in this world. Verily not one that heard it preached, or read it, unlesse he be like a sponge which sucks in all both good and bad, of all that he heares and sees: Or like an Houre-glasse that takes it in at one eare, and out at the other: Or like a wine-sacke that retaines the lees onely, and lets the good wine run out; when as they should be like those that sift the Corne, casting out that which is nothing worth, and retaining the cleane Corne; drinking in all good, as the earth doth a sweet shower of raine, or a drift of raine, which returneth not untill it hath fructified and made a barren ground fertile.</p>
            <p>I know nothing more convincing to mortifie a man, then to looke upon the Revelation of the Text, and be resolved what this world is, even a Sea of glasse like unto
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:101551:21"/>
Crystall, as a Sea restlesse and tumultuous, casting up fome and dirt. Oh that we had never known in our Countrey, how neerely the rage of the Sea, and the tumultuousnesse of the people resemble one the other. Hee that discernes it not in the Meditation on my Text, I refer him to read the 19. Chap. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> wherein he shall observe in reading, 1. Of <hi>no small stir;</hi> 2. Of <hi>men full of wrath,</hi> and crying out, <hi>Great is Diana of the Ephesians;</hi> 3. That <hi>the City was filled with confusion;</hi> 4. A crying out, <hi>some one thing, some another;</hi> 5. That <hi>the major part knew not wherefore they were come together.</hi> This is the world, and I would to God we had not wofull experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence thereof in this kind. That Christian that doth not see this as in a vision in my Text unlesse he make further tryall, I will tell him in fine a facetious relation to shut up this sad Elegy that I heard often (as occasion was offered) by an ancient Parliament Knight of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonshire</hi> of one of his Neighbors, who being a Copy-holder of some 30. pound <hi>per annum,</hi> and dwelling by the Sea side neere <hi>Plymouth,</hi> observing that certaine of his Neighbours trading to Sea, came home gallant and rich, and lived in a very plentifully manner; hee would to Sea that he would, against all his friends minds; sold his Oxen, Horse, Sheepe, his Land for a time, made up a stock, left his wife and children with her father. To Sea goes he, the Fraight returned was Figges. A flaw of wind comes, the Ship is endangered, they must lighten the Ship, as <hi>Pauls</hi> companions did, <hi>Act.</hi> 27. when they were constrained to cast out the wheat which was their lading, into the Sea: So here, over-boord goe the Figs, this poore Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man cryes out, O there goes over-boord all my Oxen, and names them by their names. Home he comes poore, his Neighbours pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying his folly, one lends him an Oxe, another an Horse: after some few yeeres he picks up his crums againe, and being at Plough on a very faire and calme day, cryes Hoe to his boy that did drive: He stands still, looks on the Sea, for he dwelt (as I said before) at the very Sea side, and saw it as smooth as a Smelt, and said, Wennom on you, how is't you look so smooth? you long for more Figs do you? your smooth looks shall never deceive me again I warrant you; drive away. Semblably twill be his dole, who will not beleeve his God. <hi>Credit se formae, Deo non voluit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> He trusted a few boards put into form, and would not trust to the ever-living God. <hi>The very God of peace &amp; love sanctifie you throughly out, and I pray God make us all wise to salvation, and preserve us all, and our children in the saving grace of Jesus.</hi>
