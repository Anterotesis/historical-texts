            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <hi>Nov.</hi> 1662.</note> a certain Deed Poll ſet up by <hi>Fitton,</hi> and condemned in a Trial at the <hi>King's Bench-Bar,</hi> upon a feigned Iſſue, to be vacated, and the Eſtate to be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed to the ſaid Earl, from all farther Pretences of <hi>Fitton,</hi> or other the Defendents, or any claiming under him, or them, unleſs he or they made out a Title upon that Deed, which was the only Pretence, within twelve months, and the ſaid <hi>Fitton</hi> was to pay the whole Coſts. After this <hi>Fitton</hi> gives notice of a Trial, but would not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; and when the twelve months were almoſt expired, and he was under a neceſſity of trying then, or not at all, he prayed farther time; but was juſtly denied it, being 'twas manifeſtly for vexatious Delay. And upon Trial at the Grand Seſſions of <hi>Cheſter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Nov.</hi> 2. 1663.</note> being the proper County, the Verdict going againſt him, the Decree was made Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute. Having acquieſt under this for above one and twenty Years, excepting only that he queſtioned the Witneſſes to the Will for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, of which they were acquitted by Verdict,<note place="margin">20 <hi>Car.</hi> 2.</note> he brings his Bill of Review before the preſent Lord Keeper;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>April</hi> 16. 1684.</note> who at firſt required his paiment of the Coſts, before he would put the Earl to anſwer, till <hi>Fitton</hi> ſwore his abſolute inability to pay them.</p>
            <p>Upon the Earl's Plea and Demurrer, <hi>Fitton</hi>'s Bill was diſmiſt;<note place="margin">Term <hi>Hill.</hi> 1684.</note> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this <hi>Fitton</hi> petitioned for a Re-hearing; which was granted him, but he did not proſecute it.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Suggeſtions upon which his Petition is grounded, with their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, are theſe:</head>
               <p n="1">1. That he had been many Years in poſſeſſion of the Eſtate: Whereas he had not been in poſſeſſion above four Years, and thoſe in the Times of the Uſurpation, while the now Earl was in Exile with
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45192:2"/>
his late Majeſty. During which time, the ſaid Earl refuſing any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, though 'twas offered him, received not any benefit of that, or of his paternal Eſtate: And before he was driven out for his Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, he was, by virtue of the ſaid Will, in poſſeſſion of all Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>'s Eſtate, not in Jointure or Mortgage; and received the Rents of the ſame, immediatly upon the Death of Sir <hi>Edward</hi>'s Mother, Grandmother to the now Earl; excepting only one part of <hi>Goſworth,</hi> which was ſo infeſted with the Enemy's Troops, that the Earl could not come at it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Earl claimed, under a Will of Sir <hi>Edward</hi>'s; The Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner under a Settlement with Power of Revocation, and a Deed Poll releaſing that Power, both antecedent to the Will: And that though he had conteſted the Will, he was not admitted to any Trial upon it; wherein he ſays, <hi>He had manifeſt Wrong and Injuſtice.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it appears, upon his own Anſwer, that he never conteſted it, but wholly relied upon his Deed Poll, and ſays, <hi>Whether a Will or no Will is not material.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anſw. <hi>fo.</hi> 16 &amp; 17.</note> And no Man can imagine, that when he had a good Title by a Settlement prior to the Will, he would incur the Crime and Hazard of contriving the Deed Poll, unleſs he had believed that there was ſuch a Will. Nor was <hi>Fitton</hi> ſtraightned, as he complains, from trying the Merits of the Cauſe upon the Will; for the ſecond Trial was in Ejectment, and as <hi>Fitton</hi> had a very good Title upon the firſt Settlement till the Will were proved; 'tis evident that the Will could not but come in queſtion, and in Fact was fully proved.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Fitton</hi> will have it, that the Earl being Plantiff in <hi>Chancery,</hi> it lay upon him to prove his Will: which he did in that Court, but was not to be put to do it elſewhere, unleſs <hi>Fitton</hi> had conteſted it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To diſcredit the ſaid Earl, <hi>Fitton</hi> affirms that the ſaid Earl had a Verdict againſt the Deed Poll, upon the Evidence of one <hi>Granger,</hi> a notorious Cheat, whereby he would inſinuate as if there were no other Evidence againſt it; which is not only a reflection upon two Juries who diſbelieved it, but even two Judgments of the Houſe of Lords,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>July</hi> 9. 1663</note> one of which cenſured <hi>Fitton</hi> and his Accomplices for their contrivance, to caſt their practices with <hi>Granger</hi> upon the Earl. The other condemned the Libel to be burnt by the common Hangman,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>July</hi> 11. 1663.</note> and nothing but the Earl's Clemency, at <hi>Fitton</hi>'s requeſt upon his Knee, after a Jury was impanelled, ſtopped the ſaid Earl from having him tried, upon an Information of Forgery.</p>
               <p>Beſides, not to mention all the Circumſtances which evinced the Forgery, (which ſurely one need not, after the Deed has been cancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by order of the High Court of <hi>Chancery,</hi> upon two ſolemn Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als) there were theſe Particulars extreamly pregnant, I may ſay de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative, againſt it. That he neither in Marriage Treaties, nor Trials before with others, concerning the Eſtate, ever produced ſuch Deed. Nor did his own Father know of it till the Suit with the now Earl, and the ſuppoſed Witneſſes to it declared, a little before they ſwore, that they knew nothing of any ſuch Deed; and when they were croſs examined upon the Trial, they could give no account of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45192:2"/>
Time, or Place,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>v.</hi> The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree which mentions this</note> or any one Circumſtance in relation to the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it.</p>
               <p>Nay, one of them, <hi>Richard Davenport,</hi> at <hi>Cheſter,</hi> after the Verdict was over (it having been proved at the Trial what Reward had been promiſed him by one <hi>Berwick,</hi> another ſuppoſed Witneſs) before the whole Jury and ſeveral other Gentlemen, begg'd the Earl's Pardon for ſwearing falſly that he was a Witneſs to the Execution of the Deed, and deſired the Earl not to proſecute him.</p>
               <p>Whereas <hi>Fitton</hi> affirm'd openly in Chancery, that he never knew <hi>Granger,</hi> nor was in his company; yet the contrary was fully proved on the Trial at the King's Bench Bar by ſeveral Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>And the Jury declared that they had ſufficient Evidence of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery without Conſideration of <hi>Granger</hi>; and in truth there was an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the nature of the thing, for the Settlement to the advantage of <hi>Fitton,</hi> with power of Revocation, was made in the Life-time of Sir <hi>Edward</hi>'s ſecond Lady; and in that Settlement was no Proviſion for any Child or Children, beyond the Heirs of his Body, which could be but one at a time. There was indeed a Limitation before that to the <hi>Fittons,</hi> to ſuch Perſon or Perſons, Eſtate or Eſtates, as he ſhould limit or appoint by Will or Deed. <hi>Fitton</hi> pretends to a Releaſe of all this Power by his Deed-Poll of <hi>April</hi> 1642, when Sir <hi>Edward</hi> was newly married to a young Lady, himſelf in his full Strength and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of Children, and at the ſame time <hi>W. Fitton,</hi> to whom the Eſtate was firſt limited, was known by Sir <hi>Edward</hi> to be in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion; and the Eſtate, if Sir <hi>Edward</hi> died, muſt needs have been forfeited; and by that pretended Deed Sir <hi>Edward</hi> would not only have deprived himſelf of Power to provide for ſuch Children as he might well expect to have, but even from raiſing ſuch Monies as might be neceſſary to carry on his then Maieſties Service, for which he was engaged to the utmoſt, or for any other occaſions; and no Man could believe this of a Man ſo prudent, as all agreed Sir <hi>Edward</hi> to be.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He ſuggeſts that the Poſſeſſion and Deeds were decreed againſt him before the Cauſe determined, whereas it was not till after ſolemn Trial at the Bar; and the ſecond Trial was wholly in his favour, and he had all the Deeds to uſe at the ſecond Trial: Nor can he complain that his Deed-Poll was ſent down with a mark of Infamy upon it after the firſt Verdict; or that before that his Deed-Poll was called a pretended Deed, in the order for the firſt Trial, ſince ſeveral Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that appeared in Chancery were ſtrong againſt it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That his Inheritance was abſolutely concluded upon a ſingle Trial, whereas 'tis apparent that there were two ſolemn ones,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>v.</hi> Rolls ab Tit. Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery.</note> nor was the right of Inheritance touch'd, but only the Perſon bound.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But then he would give Laws and Limits of his own to the power of the <hi>Chancery,</hi> and ſays that it ought only to have ſet aſide a Leaſe of 99 Years upon the Eſtate, ſo that it might not hinder the Trial of the Right of Inheritance; that this was a Truſt properly within its power, but that the Right of Inheritance was not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:45192:3"/>And the Councel before a Committe of Lords, being convinced of the falſhood of his other Suggeſtions, ſeemed in their Reply to put all their Streſs upon this as a thing not anſwered, as if their Opinion of the Power of that Court, contrary to the Judgment of the Lord Chancellor <hi>Clarendon,</hi> and the now Lord Keeper, deſerved an Anſwer. But they might have conſidered that the <hi>Chancery</hi> did not, nor ever does take away any Man's Right of Inheritance, but quiets the Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and gives the other Incidents to them that have the Right either admitted, or proved upon Trial, according to the matter in Iſſue.</p>
               <p>But then the Petition ſays, that no more than ſetting aſide that Leaſe was pray'd by the Bill; whereas it as well ſets forth the Will <hi>in haec verba,</hi> and the Earls Title by it, complains of <hi>Fitton</hi>'s ſetting up Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, and having Deeds concerning the Eſtate, of which, and of all Conſpiracies, it deſires a diſcovery, and prays Relief upon the whole: And was it unreaſonable, or out of the Power of the <hi>Chancery,</hi> as a proper Relief in this Caſe, to give the mean Profits, tho not particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly required in the Bill,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid.</hi> The Decree.</note> but moved for by Counſel, being confeſſed by the Anſwer, and to eſtabliſh the Poſſeſſion againſt one who would counterfeit a Title to a Man's Eſtate? Shall he afterwards be admitted to conteſt that Title, which is not to be impeached but by a forged Deed? If indeed he had urged that the Will was forged, or that there was no Will, then no Incident to the Right of Inheritance claimed by that would have been given in <hi>Chancery,</hi> till the Will had been tried at Common Law; but in this Caſe, the Trial of the Deed, was the Trial of the Right of Inheritance, which being over, the Leaſe in truſt was to be aſſigned to attend the Inheritance, and could not have been duly aſſigned before.</p>
               <p>But whereas Mr. <hi>Fitton</hi> thinks it hard that he ſhould not now be ſuffered to try the Will, as if he could manifeſtly diſprove it; and he has poſſeſt ſome with the Be<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> that <hi>Granger,</hi> who was his Creature and Accomplice, had an hand in the Will. 'Tis requiſite to give ſome account of the Proof that there has been to it formerly; and the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that Proof is, the clearer is the Argument, that it ought not now to be queſtioned. For ſurely it is not enough to ſay, Pray let me be admitted to ſue for his Eſtate, tho I have been never ſo vexatious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, becauſe he can eaſily make out a good Title.</p>

               <p n="2">2. The poſitive Proofs to the Will.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Several Circumſtances ſubſequent, which evince that Sir <hi>Edward</hi> had made a Will, and that they who proved the Will ſwore true.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt was proved at large directly, and expreſly, by <hi>Henry Manwaring</hi> of <hi>Canningham</hi> in <hi>Cheſhire</hi> Eſquire, who married one of Sir <hi>Edward</hi>'s Co-heirs, and could not be ſuppoſed to ſwear falſly ſo much againſt his Intereſt. <hi>Richard Sneyd</hi> of <hi>Egmond</hi> in the County of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45192:3"/>
                  <hi>Stafford,</hi> Eſquire, Brother to Sir <hi>Edward</hi>'s ſecond Lady. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rïan Leigh</hi> of St. <hi>Giles Cripple-gate,</hi> Eſquire, <hi>Francis Hollinſhead</hi> of <hi>Leek</hi> in the ſaid County of <hi>Stafford,</hi> Gent. and <hi>Leonard Watſon,</hi> Yeoman, who had been Bailiff to Sir <hi>Edward</hi>'s Mother. And there was full Proof that Sir <hi>Edward,</hi> who was a zealous Aſſerter of his King's Right, and the Church of <hi>England</hi> as by Law eſtabliſhed, was extremely diſpleaſed with <hi>Fitton,</hi> being informed, as the truth was, that he was on the ſide of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels; as he was, after he came into <hi>England,</hi> actually in Arms againſt the King, under the Command of Col. <hi>Bradſhaw</hi>: and Sir <hi>Edward</hi> frequently declared his reſolution to give the Earl his Eſtate (being his Siſter's Son) for his ſignal Service to his then Majeſty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That Sir <hi>Edward</hi> made his Will as aforeſaid, was proved by Dr. <hi>Smallwood,</hi> who was his Chaplain at the making of his Will, both domeſtick and belonging to his Regiment; and afterwards Chaplain in Ordinary to his late Majeſty, and Dean of <hi>Litchfield,</hi> a Perſon of known Worth and Integrity, who ſwore that he was preſent, and a Witneſs to the ſealing, publiſhing, and delivery of the laſt Will and Teſtament of the ſaid Sir <hi>Edward</hi>; Dated <hi>Auguſt</hi> 16. 1643. That it was executed at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> he being of ſound Memory and Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and was his Voluntary Act, and according to his declared Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That the other three Perſons, whoſe Names were ſubſcribed, were preſent; That Sir <hi>Edward</hi> delivered it to his Cuſtody with ſolemn Charge to be true to his Truſt; And in diſcharge of the ſaid Truſt, he delivered it to the now Earl ſince his return to <hi>England</hi> with his late Majeſty: But that the Earl knew of the Will within two days after the making of it, was proved by <hi>Richard Sneyd</hi> aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>The aforeſaid <hi>Francis Hollinſhead,</hi> another Witneſs whoſe Name was ſubſcribed to the ſaid Will, ſwore as <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ully to the execution of it as Dr. <hi>Smallwood</hi> did.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Edmond Aſhenhurſt</hi> of the <hi>Old Park</hi> in <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> Gent. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Name of <hi>William Aſhenhurſt</hi> his Nephew, another Witneſs, whoſe Name was ſubſcribed, and who was a Chyrurgion to Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>'s Regiment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John Davenport,</hi> another Witneſs to the Will, died within a very ſhort time after.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Edmond Aſhenhurſt</hi> aforenamed, ſwore that when Sir <hi>Edward</hi>'s Corps were carried to be buried at <hi>Oxford,</hi> both <hi>William Ashenhurſt,</hi> and <hi>Francis Hollinshead</hi> told him, that Sir <hi>Edward</hi> had ſetled all his Eſtate on the now Earl; and at ſeveral other times they declared that it was by Will, to which they were Witneſſes.</p>

                  <hi>Eliſha Manwaring</hi> of <hi>Morton Sands</hi> in <hi>Cheshire,</hi> Gent. <hi>James Ing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> of <hi>Congleton,</hi> in the ſame County, Joyner, <hi>Raphael Hollinshead</hi> of <hi>Halſal,</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> Gent. <hi>William Trafford</hi> of <hi>Swithamley</hi> in <hi>Stafford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheire,</hi> Eſquire, <hi>Thomas Powel</hi> of <hi>Hoſely</hi> in <hi>Flintſhire,</hi> Eſquire, and <hi>Henry Manwaring</hi> above mentioned, ſwore to the like Declaration of <hi>Francis Hollinshead. Thomas Green</hi> of <hi>Congleton</hi> in <hi>Cheshire,</hi> Gent. preſently after Sir <hi>Edward</hi>'s Death, heard it credibly reported at <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol,</hi> that Sir <hi>Edward</hi> had ſetled his Eſtate in <hi>Cheshire</hi> upon the now
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45192:4"/>
Earl. And <hi>William Kirk</hi> of <hi>Aleford,</hi> Yeoman, who had been a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier under Sir <hi>Edward,</hi> ſwore to the like Report. <hi>Richard Sneyd</hi> ſwore that the laſt words Sir <hi>Edward</hi> ſpoke, were of rejoycing that ſo worthy a Perſon as his Nephew <hi>Gerrard</hi> was to ſucceed him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry Manwaring</hi> aforeſaid, depoſed that Dr. <hi>Smallwood</hi> told him, as a Secret, before the King's coming in, that Sir <hi>Edward</hi> had ſettled his Eſtate upon the now Earl, and that he was a Witneſs to it.</p>
               <p>And the aforeſaid <hi>Thomas Holland</hi> ſwore to the like Declaration, made to him by the Doctor.</p>
               <p>And ſeveral Diſcourſes of Dr. <hi>Smallwood,</hi> and <hi>Francis Hollinshead</hi> to their Friends preſently after the Death of Sir <hi>Edward,</hi> and at other times, and but late before the King's Reſtauration, wherein they declared their having been Witneſſes to the Will, were proved by <hi>Richard Leving,</hi> Eſquire, Recorder of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> one of <hi>Fitton</hi>'s own Counſel. <hi>Thomas Foſter</hi> of <hi>Holt</hi> in <hi>Denbigh-ſhire,</hi> Gent. and <hi>John Smallwood</hi> of <hi>Middlewich</hi> in <hi>Cheshire,</hi> Gent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thomas Pinfold,</hi> Clerk, or Proctor in the Eccleſiaſtical Court, proved, that when the ſaid Will of Sir <hi>Edward</hi>'s of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1643, was brought into the Office in <hi>May</hi> 1661, the Seal thereto was fairly fixed, but was after broken off, after one, againſt whoſe Intereſt it ſeemed, had peruſed it, and three Witneſſes more proved the ſame.</p>
               <p>And the two ſurviving Witneſſes to the Will having been proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by <hi>Fitton</hi> upon an Information of Perjury, for their Evidence concerning the ſame, were acquitted by a Verdict.</p>
               <p>Theſe Reaſons, among ſeveral others, ſeem to evince that <hi>Fitton</hi> ought not now to have an Appeal allowed to reverſe the Decree, ſo long ſince ſetled.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Will which Mr. <hi>Fitton</hi> would now diſpute, was proved in Form of Law in the Eccleſiaſtical Court, before the Earl exhibited his Bill in <hi>Chancery,</hi> there Mr. <hi>Fitton</hi> might have been admitted to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it if he could; All Parties concerned, have either a particular or general Citation there, before the Witneſſes are allowed; and any Man that litigates, may have them croſs examined.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Will was proved in <hi>Chancery,</hi> and the Witneſſes juſtified by Order of that Court, notwithſtanding the Exceptions which Mr. <hi>Fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> took, and is declared a good Will in the Decree in theſe words, <q>Nothing did appear, either in proof or otherwiſe, to the diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Will; but the Court was fully ſatisfied that the ſame was really ſigned, ſealed, and publiſhed, by the ſaid Sir <hi>Edward</hi> at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> as his laſt Will and Teſtament; and that it then was, and for ſeveral Years before had been his full Intention to ſettle the Premiſſes upon the Complainant, in caſe he died without Iſſue of his Body.</q>
               </p>
               <p>If this Decree ſhould be revers'd, the Will will loſe all that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and Authority which it has ſo long enjoyed from that Court; and ſurely that ought not to be taken away without manifeſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>Beſides, I take it to be a judg'd Caſe, that this ought not now to be queſtioned.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:45192:4"/>There are two Reſolutions in <hi>Rolls.</hi> That,<note place="margin">Rolls ab Tit. Chancery, <hi>fol. 382.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>If the Chancellor err in his Decree, upon a Matter of Fact, this Decree is final, and can't be reviewed, becauſe they ought not to go to new examination of Witneſſes, for it cannot be done after publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>If in <hi>Fitton</hi>'s Caſe the Bill of Review were legally diſmiſs'd, there can now be no colour for his Appeal.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Credit of the Witneſſes to the Will, ought not to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached after ſo ſolemn Juſtifications as above mentioned, ſo long ſince, when there have been Marriage—and other Settlements, never conteſted for many Years, and depending wholly upon the Will, which they have proved; and they are not now alive to evince the Matter, by ſuch Circumſtances as they might prove by others, which cannot now be known. It has been objected, That it appears by the Oath in <hi>Chancery</hi> of Dr. <hi>Smallwood,</hi> the principal Witneſs to the Will, that he ſwore he knew nothing of the Will: Whereas it was in relation to another Will made <hi>Anno</hi> 1641, to which the ſaid Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor was no way privy; whereby the ſaid Sir <hi>Edward</hi> diſpoſed of his Perſonal Eſtate to the Co-heirs, and their eldeſt Sons, all but the Earl's Mother and himſelf, which is a further Evidence for the Will by which he claims.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Beſides, that all the Witneſſes to the Will, which was made about two and forty years ago, are dead; ſeveral who confirmed their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony by undeniable Circumſtances, are dead alſo.</p>
               <p n="5">5. 'Tis not reaſonable that a Man ſhould have Advantage by his own Crime. <hi>Fitton,</hi> if not enioyn'd by Chancery might in his way have let up one pretence after another, and when all <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>a<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ed, might be let in to conteſt that Title, againſt which he was driven to ſuch miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Shifts.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It was never known that any Decree of the Court of Chancery was ſet aſide, without Error apparent, or New Matter emergent, the Pretence to the laſt of which, ought not certainly to be received after ſo long a time, for ſuch Practices as have already appeared, and the moſt ſeeming Errors have been already ſhewn to have been none, as Mr. <hi>Fitton</hi>'s Petition has given occaſion to obſerve them. The others mentioned in his Bill of Review, are theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) That there were more concerned in the Settlement, under which the Complainant claims, than were made Parties to the Bill. Which is no material Objection, ſince they might have lawfully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſupport the Deed, but cannot pretend any right upon a Deed adjudged forged: however, no Right is taken from any Body.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) That the Coſts and mean Profits are awarded before the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Trial, when it did not appear that there was cauſe. But ſurely
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45192:5"/>
it is not ſeverer in the <hi>Chancery,</hi> than in the Common-Law Courts, to direct the paiment of the Coſts of the firſt Trial, before they allow a Second; and the laſt being wholly in favour to Mr. <hi>Fitton,</hi> he had no reaſon to complain that the Earl was to have mean Profits as well as Coſts; beſides, they are here in the nature of Coſts.</p>
               <p>And the ſame reaſon juſtifies the decreeing the Aſſignment of the Leaſe before the ſecond Trial, which was another Exception.</p>
               <p n="7">7. 'Tis not reaſonable that Suits ſhould be perpetual, and Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons always unquiet. And if <hi>Fitton</hi> has made frequent Entries and Claims, as his Counſel offered in his behalf, 'tis fitting that he ſhould be barred, even of them, after reſting ſo long from legal Proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. He ſays indeed, that by the Decree in Chancery, he had his Deeds taken from him, and was deprived of the Liberty of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whereby he was utterly incapacitated to ſeek for relief till now.</p>
               <p>Whereas 'tis well known that he went at large at his Pleaſure; and if the Deed-Poll was forg'd, as was plainly proved, there was no reaſon for him to retain the former Deed of Settlement, or any other Deeds which were Evidences belonging to the Earl's Eſtate. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Incapacity he lay under, was occaſioned by his own Crime; (and no Man can give a better term to the ſetting up a forg'd Deed) if his Caſe had not been ſuch as, while it was freſh in Mens Memories, loſt him all Credit, he might certainly at any time have had the like Supply as now, were it not that he and they who now ſupply him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon ſomething elſe beſides the Merits of the Cauſe; and it would be hard upon Men, that have been in long poſſeſſion of their Eſtates, if they ſhould not be protected from ſuch as are enabled to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome, barely becauſe the<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
