            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>bed in this Region of civil death, while the Spirit thereof liveth in Your Service, by the occaſion of this my paſsive condition.</p>
            <p>In this ſtate of violent quieſcence, my thoughts <hi>(Madam)</hi> have not ceaſed to range
<pb facs="tcp:115212:4"/>
and caſt about in theſe ſpacious fields of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude,</hi> to finde a way, how, my perſon being now like a Clock with a broken <hi>Spring,</hi> unable to give You an account of my time by my own Motion, I might contrive my preſent ſtate, as it were, into a <hi>Sun-dyal,</hi> which while it ſelf is fixed, doth by an extrinſique Motion give an account of Time: In ſome report to this Conceit, I have bethought my ſelf of drawing ſome ſuch lines within my walls, by the rules of <hi>Spiritual Mathematiques,</hi> as might (by the Motion of that Sun upon them, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſhines the brighteſt through the cloſeſt walls of Priſons, they like Chryſtal curtains, intending rather then intercepting his beams) render You, <hi>Madam,</hi> an account hereafter of my preſent time, by the ſtrange property of this Spiritual <hi>Dyal,</hi> which may mark out the paſſage, even of hours already elapſed: And, I hope, theſe lines have yet this better quality, of bearing ſome marks of the fervor and operation of this Sun upon my thoughts,
<pb facs="tcp:115212:5"/>
as of their courſe and motion towards Your Memory; which Impreſsion if they retain, this one act doth happily conjoyn theſe two great Duties, of <hi>Gratitude</hi> to God, and to Your <hi>Majeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In my preſent conveniency <hi>(Madam)</hi> of contemplating much theſe two ſubjects, I have often reſolved, That God had deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed You ſo ſpecially, for the mediate convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of all his Bleſsings to me, as that he would not miniſter this his Medicinal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, but as it were by the hand of Your Service; by which order he hath been pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to render Your adverſity more beneficial to me, then ever Your felicity was like to prove, ſince it is not probable that Your Power would have given me what I finde now to have been moſt wanting to my Life, <hi>Sufferance</hi> and <hi>Mortification;</hi> inſomuch, as what my vain Nature needed the moſt, and Your generous one, could afford me the leaſt, hath by the accidents of Your fortune,
<pb facs="tcp:115212:5"/>
binfurniſhed me, with the preſervation of Your favorable conſtancy; and thus, without the ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh of any of Your Vertues, Your Service hath taught me <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Reſignation;</hi> Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which though You had them habitually in Your minde, yet neither were Your Nature or Your Fortune, the one apt, or the other proper, to give Your Servants occaſion to practice them.</p>
            <p>Nor doth this my particular bleſsing of Sufferance, endure any abatement by the ſenſe of Your perſonal afflictions; for GOD hath provided againſt this allay of it, by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, at the ſame time, of all Your Vertues and Pieties; So, as in reſpect of Your Perſon, I may rejoyce likewiſe in all Your tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations, ſince every Thorn in Your preſent <hi>Crown</hi> hath been a kinde of penſil, the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt touches whereof have drawn You the nearer that <hi>original Head,</hi> crowned with Thorns, whoſe reſemblance ought to be Your principal intendment: And if what You have loſt of the likeneſs of a Terreſtrial Prince, hath

of gratitude is ſo much conditioned in Gods notorious Pardons, as even the looſer part of the world expecteth ſome extraordinary recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition from them; and their uncorreſpondency to that meaſure of Edification, which is looked for by unreformed obſervers, doth diſcredit to the world thoſe invitations to amendment, which are commonly made by the firſt perſwaſive fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors of zealous Converts: For one patern of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe and retrogradation, ſubſtracteth ſo much from the efficacy of ſuch Examples, as that defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is apt to render many ſincere progreſsions in the firſt fervor, ſuſpected of unſoundneſs and recidency: And by this ſuſpition of unperſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, there may well be blaſted much of the fruit of extraordinary Converſions; for Libertines, with a little tincture of Truth in ſuch receſſes from zeal, will colour a great deal of witty im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety: So that this ſcandalous remiſneſs, ſeemeth to give a fair paſs for Prophaneneſs to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſal upon Devotion, which doth take from Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines ſo many affected freedoms; ſo great a detriment doth a little Scandal procure to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, in ſuch as have the ſeal of Extraordinary Pardons upon them, evidenced to the Eye of the world: And on the other ſide, when ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable vocations continue ſo exemplary, as they anſwer all equal and juſt expectations, and

obſtruct all licentious tongues, the benefit they impart unto the world, is likely more then the native piety of many unſeduced perſons.</p>
            <p>Me thinks the previſion of this utility, may be given for a handſom reaſon, of the rejoycing of <hi>Angels,</hi> in one Converſion, more then in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency of many vertuous tempers; for Humane Nature (which the <hi>Angels</hi> are better acquainted with then we, as being incharged with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting it to Spiritual improvements) is well charactered in the ſtiffneſs and indocility of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> ſince it is apt to be demanding a Sign from Heaven, for Reformation of corrupted Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms; and deſperate Spiritual recoveries ſeem ſo many openings of the Heavens, in the deſcent of the Holy Dove viſibly to the ſtanders by: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Angels,</hi> upon their precognition of the extraordinary efficacy of ſuch Converſions, may well be ſpeculated to ground this exceeding joy and exultation.</p>

            <p>Surely all notorious cures of ſuch as have faln into the thiefs hands between <hi>Iericho</hi> and <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> are never ſo perfect, as when the Scars or Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catrices remain in the eyes of the Patients, rather as marks of their miſery, then pledges of their continuing health; and ſo their lives which are ſet out to others by God, as Enſigns of victory, muſt be looked upon by themſelves, as wrecks ſaved and ſet up in their own thoughts for memorials of the danger whereunto they are ſtill expoſed; for God doth often ſet up in publike ſuch figures of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane miſery, and divine mercy, not only in commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeration of the particular ſubjects, but in conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendence to the bent of our common nature, which runneth after example, and ſeemeth but dragg'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſingle precepts.</p>

Wherefore all remarkable Converts ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count themſelves as ſent from the dead upon the ſuit of their neceſsitous brothers, in Gods compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to them, as well as to themſelves, the world being much better diſpoſed to hear ſuch meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, then <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets;</hi> and in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, they ſhould ſtudy to live exactly by this rule of St. <hi>Paul, Yield your ſelves unto God, as thoſe that</hi>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115212:21"/>
the ſoule and bodie in man, hold an analogie with the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the earth, in point of conſtituting but one world of theſe ſo differing ſubſtances; So ſhall we doe well to conſider the ſpirituall and corporeall ſubſtances in man, as making one coexiſtence, whereby we may the better underſtand the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ſubject we diſcourſe upon, and reflecting on man's conſiſting of two ſo diverſe portions, as ſpirit and materiality, we ſhall wonder the leſſe, at thoſe ſo diſcordant qualities, which are found in this compound nature of Man.</p>
               <p>If Faith did not oblige us to beleeve our own originall inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, we have ſcarce vertue enough left to own it, our reaſon is ſo degenerated, as ſhe hath no mind to claime by that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription the dominion of our ſenſitive appetites (which are her naturall ſubjects) ſhe ſeemes ſo much better pleaſed to yeeld unto their government: but let us move Reaſon (by the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of her prerogative, and the debaſement of her conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in ſubmitting to the rule of our paſſions) to endeavour the recovering as much of her Rights, as can ſtand with the forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of her firſt ſtate.</p>
               <p>God made man ſo noble a creature, as even in his obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe to miſery, there was an excellence of nature; For the freedome of his will was one of the chiefe prerogatives of his ſtate, and the abuſe of this power, declares the dignity of it, by the ſeverity of God's vindication, ſince upon the firſt defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of mans will from him, God did teare and divide the Kingdome he had given him, rending the ſenſitive powers from the dominion of the rationall; And in this breach, he left mans reaſon though not wholly depoſed, yet ſo much diſtreſſed by the powers of the other revolted Tribes, as ſhe needs now a forrein ſuccour, not onely prevenient, but actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally concomitant for her ſupport, in this continuall warfare againſt her naturall ſubjects, our affections and ſenſitive ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, which have ſet up idols of their own making, like <hi>Jeroboams</hi> calves, (the delights of the ſenſes) to maintaine this diviſion and independencie, upon the ſoveraignty of reaſon, to which they were at firſt ſubjected, looking alwayes up
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115212:21"/>
with the eyes of the Hand-maid, upon the eyes of the Miſtreſſe ſincere and rectified reaſon. This firſt happy ſtate of man we are bound to beleeve, even in this deplorable condition we now find him, for the ſpirit of his Creator aſſures us, that <hi>God made man upright,</hi> &amp; <hi>he intangled himſelf in all his perplexities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may therefore well ask the <hi>Prophets</hi> queſtion, <hi>O how didſt thou fall in this Morning light,</hi> when there was but one block in all the earth to ſtumble at? Thou wert made to tread upon the earth, onely as on a ſtage, beautified and adorned for thy paſſage over it, in triumph up to heaven, not to ſink into it, and be wrapp'd up in it, in this foule and dark conveyance of thee, whereunto thou art now ſentenced. Thou waſt created to have been ſerved onely by the mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all creatures, not to have ſuffered with them by any change, which ſhould have been in thee onely a tranſlation of thy earth to heaven, not a reſolution of it into duſt; for mans ſoule as having never been offended by his body, ſhould never have put it away, and left it to his owne vility, but ſhould have gratified the ſervices thereof, with an immediate prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to glory and impaſſibility: O! what can be anſwered by man for this ſelfe-deſtruction?</p>
               <p>Me thinks Man replyes, that the weight of the then greateſt of all created ſubſtances, falling from heaven, fell upon him, and thus ſhiver'd him into duſt; indeed this is all can be ſaid to move compaſſion for him, and this prevailed ſo much with his Maker, as Man's fall was commiſerated and redreſſed, and he that fell upon him, was left faſtned to the abiſſe of his own precipitation. What a ſad contemplation is this, that the morning ſtar who was created to feed onely on the increated light, was ſo ſoone condemned to feed on duſt, as being falne from an Angel to a Serpent; and Man who was to riſe up to the Purity of Angels, and to know no fouleneſſe by the way, was quickly ſentenced to the becomming duſt: ſo that by this commerce with the Serpent, Man is become his food. O then as the Wiſe-man ſayes, ſure it is the tongue of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, while he fed firſt upon thee, that infuſed the poyſon of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115212:22"/>
pride into all thy corruption; For mans nature ſavours ſo of this venome, by which it was firſt tainted, (which came from the Serpent, who retains his pride in all his debaſement) as even through all the veines of mans infirmities there runs ſtill this mortal ſpirit of ſelf-love and preſumption, though he be reduced daily, to plead the miſery and infirmity of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in defence of his reproachable imperfections.</p>
               <p>There ſeemes to be no better Character of the infelicity of humane nature, then is made by thoſe, who inveigh againſt the weakneſſe of it, yet claime that as an authority for all their faults, making the propenſity to ill, the patronage of it, as if the forbidden fruit were now become medicinall for a weak conſcience: That is, as if our inward frailty might ſerve for a purgation of moſt of our faults.

               <p>This conſidered, may not we ſay that the Serpent while he feeds upon our duſt, (that is, prevaileth upon our frailties) blowes part of it into our eyes, to blind us, raiſing this cloud out of our infirmities, that we may ſee no way out of them: which ſubtilty prevaileth ſo much, as deſpairing often of our conſtitution, we conſult our poyſoner, for receipts, onely to give us a fair and eaſie paſſage through this life, and for allay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the diſquiets of our nature, he gives us ſuch remedies, as are pleaſant for our ſenſes to take, which are variety of ſenſible fruitions, that rock our childiſh nature into ſome reſt, by the motions of her owne infirmities; Thus commonly our life is but a continued ſlumber, in which our reaſon lies bound up, and our fancie is the onely looſe and living faculty of our ſoule, which raiſeth to us, but dreames and ſimilitudes of good and evill, ſometimes vaine images of joyes, and other amazing phantaſmes of fears; and in this dream of opinion and imagination we uſually paſſe our lives, ſeldome waking and comprehending the true nature, even of the things wherewith we are the moſt affected: In ſo much, as while the truth is that our life in this world is but a kind of dreame or ſhadow, we dreame ſo ſtrongly, as we doe not diſcerne it to be but a dreame; for the momentanyneſſe and inanity of our life ſeldome comes into our fancie, which though it be ſo ſuſcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of all levities, yet ſeldome admits the thought of mans owne lightneſſe into it; the vanities of our life, ſhadow and cover to us our lives being but a ſhadow; and thus while we breath continually in this element of vanity, it becomes as the ayre to us, which we feele not ſenſibly in our familiar reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration, and yet our breath is nothing elſe but aire: after this manner, while our life is nothing but vanity, we are the leſſe ſenſible of this conſtitution.</p>
               <p>So vaine a thing is meere humane nature, as when your wit hath fancyed the moſt ayerie and light conceptions, it can, for images of this inanity, man ſeemeth yet ſo much vainer then all thoſe expreſſions, as even all of them leave no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on man, of his owne vanity, for he makes no uſe of thoſe his apprehenſions, but lives as if hedid traduce and abuſe himſelfe in his conceptions and expreſſions of his owne vacuity and emptineſſe, and falls not at all into conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe diſabuſing notions: and thus he veriſies what the holy Spirit ſayes of him, that <hi>man compared to vanity is</hi>

               <p>This conſidered, when the nature of all the worlds toyes and nugacities is rightly diſcuſſed, all the ſpecious good of them is found to be but opinion and imagination, which may be tearmed the fume of this vapour of our lives, as it is exhaled, and vaniſheth away, and yet this fume of opinion, darkens to us the nature of our lives, as ſmoake often doth the matter out of which it is raiſed: For how familiarly the eye of our reaſon is deprived of all exerciſe by this ſmoak of opinion, I need not urge, ſince every one that goes abroad into the aire of the world, palpably ſeeth what ſore eyes Reaſon hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt

               <p>O then, how much worſe then nothing is the life of man, thus lightned and evaporated by his own fancie, when at the beſt of his carnal nature, in the <hi>holy Spirit's</hi> account, <hi>it is but a ſhadow, a dreame, or a vapour?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And certainly it was an expreſſe act of Providence, (relating to our undeceiving) this of Gods chooſing <hi>Solomon,</hi> among all his Secretaries, to make the moſt ample and preciſe manifeſt of the nature and conditions of all temporalities; for as <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander</hi> is ſaid to have furniſhed <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> largely with expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces requiſite for all ſorts of Anatomyes, when he deſigned him to write the hiſtory of Nature, that his experiments might af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford him both light for himſelf and credit with others; ſo God ſeemes to have provided <hi>Solomon</hi> an abundance and affluence of all thoſe creatures, in their beſt degree of ſincerity and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, whereof he was to deliver to the world, the nature and properties, that the ſenſibleneſſe of his experience might move and affect the world joyntly with the charity of his ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> (who had the ſame ſpirit of truth, I by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate infuſion, but did never exerciſe it in any practical expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments) had not been an organ of this truth, ſo proportinate to our infirme apprehenſion which embraces truth, ſooner, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with ſenſible particular experiments, (and ſo becomes as it were palpable) then in the univerſality of notions, while it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth more abſtracted in ſpeculation; <hi>King Solomon</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was an inſtrument ſized and fitted to worke upon our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and he, who was the beſt Moral Chymick that ever wrought upon the matter of temporallities, by the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of all fruitions, extracted this as the quinteſſence of them all. <hi>Vanity of vanities, all is vanity under the ſunne and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of ſpirit;</hi> Here then is the product and ſumme of all our loves and fruitions in this world, and after this convincing manifeſt, of the worthleſneſſe of all other creatures, alas, how much a more deplorable conviction hath he left us of the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of man, by his owne fall and prevarication, when in the

ſplendor of all this light of verity; a few fading colours in a womans face, dazel'd even his Eagles eyes, and ſo his blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and infatuation is become a clearer evidence of the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of mans nature, then even all the beames of his illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting pen.</p>
               <p>They who will look attentively upon this naked image of <hi>Solomon,</hi> need no other character of our humanity; there they ſhall diſcover all that the world accounts the ſecurity of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyneſſe to be the likelieſt betrayers of it; For he, whoſe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge exceeded the ſtock of nature, and whoſe poſſeſſions were equall with all natures proviſions, may be ſaid to have fallen by the weight of his felicities; how infirme a thing then is man, that cannot carrie even his own wiſhes without falling under them when he is charged with their ſucceſſes, for alas, how much doth familiar evidence atteſt this truth, that <hi>man in honour becomes like the beaſt that periſheth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>May not our carnall nature then be juſtly diſcredited to us, by conſidering that our life is either a perplexity of wiſhes, or a perverſion of ſucceſſes? and this convincing evidence which common experience offereth, proveth what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſayes, <note place="margin">Eccle. 3. 10.</note> that <hi>this is the affliction which God hath given to the ſons of men, to exerciſe them in it;</hi> ſince indeed this world is but a ſtage for their wraſtling and contention.</p>

                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:115212:25"/>
as to run over even into the curſing the day of his birth, and to prepoſe his mothers being a tombe for him before a delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of him into that light wherein he ſaw ſo much miſery and affliction; May we not well ſay then in reference to that of <hi>Solomon, if the beſt men on earth make this confeſſion of the miſery of their nature, what doe the worſt and the moſt</hi>

               <p>Thus have we ſeene frailty and infirmity of our corrupted nature taken from the beſt figures of it in diverſe poſtures of temporall felicity and affliction, and we perceive that in one ſtate it is ſo unhappily diſpoſed as the proneneſſe of it to ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, is raiſed by the very degrees of obligations and benefits it receiveth; Inſomuch as the plenty of temporall bleſſings, proves often an over-ballancing even of the power of abundant grace, as we ſee manifeſted in the infidelityes of <hi>Solomon:</hi> and againe we find in the other triall, how the weight of ſufferance boweth and deflects a little, even the ſtrongeſt pillars of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, among which we doe bring in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> depoſition of this truth, where we make upon all theſe ſurveys, this his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, <hi>O wretched man! who ſhall deliver thee from this body</hi>

               <p>How many virtuous <hi>Trophees</hi> are there now erected in Chriſtianity, of the victories of humane nature, over our moſt powerfull infirmity?

               </p>
               <p>In which reſpect Saint <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſayeth elegantly, the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was the renaſcency of man; as fleſh had wounded thee, ſo it now healeth thee; the Phyſitian miniſtred a receipt, compoſed of our own infirme nature, and by the infirmity of his fleſh, cured the infection of ours.</p>
               <p>And for an intire re-inforcement of our humane nature, which conſiſteth of ſpirit and fleſh, our ſpirit ſeemes to have yet a more intimate union with God, for our fleſh was but a ſuperveſture or upper Garment to the Son of God.

which impreſſeth it, and in this reſpect, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us, that <hi>he that is joyned unto God, is one ſpirit with him;</hi> we need not <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 17.</note> ſpeculate ſo curiouſly, the radiant beames of the Word of God, as to dazle or diſſipate the ſight of our minde, in this myſterious expreſſion of the holy Spirit; as much as is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent with our eyes, is the perception (by this dazling light) of what great dignity and excellence our humane nature may now own; in which the intire Trinity doth reſide, the Son of God in Perſon, the holy Ghoſt or Spirit of God, by Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and impreſſion, and conſequently God the Father by the indiviſibleneſs of his eſſence from their preſences; therefore we ſee <hi>Chriſt</hi> promiſeth us in expreſſe termes, <hi>the company of the</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Wherefore, Now O happy man that thou art, look not down upon the ſtage of the Serpent, where he lyeth ſtill hiſſing at thee, to call thy thoughts to the earth, ſince thou didſt firſt hearken to him; But raiſe thy lookes upward, to the throne of Heaven, where the ſplendor of thy humanity, at the right Hand of God, reflecteth to thee thy owne dignity, for even in the mirrour of the word, wherein God the Father ſeeth himſelfe, man may now ſee his own image; there man may ſee not only his nature made after Gods image, but God himſelfe in the image of his nature.</p>
               <p>Correſpond with thy own worthyneſſe then, O exalted creature! and live as if thou had'ſt never ſeene thy ſelfe in any other glaſſe, for here is that eminence truly conferred on thee, which thou did'ſt at firſt ſo vainly affect, of being like God, and the holy Spirit is thy councellour in this claime of thy divinity, and thy comforter againſt the diſſwaſions of thy firſt projector, who would now divert thee from the aſpiring to the conſort and participation of the divine nature which is <note place="margin">2 Peter 1. 4.</note> offered to thy aſpiring.</p>
               <p>This premiſed and ponder'd, man may ſay, <hi>I rejoyce even in my infirmities, that the power of Chriſt may reſt upon me,</hi> and <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 9.</note> triumph in me; for my ſtrength is made perfect in weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and may conſort the harp of <hi>David</hi> to the ſame tune of

So that by the adjunction of theſe helpes, even all mans infirmities may be converted into his glories, and man hath nothing left to undeifie him now, but his owne preferrence of degeneration and flavery to the enemy of his nature, before his adherence to her Author.</p>
               <p>Finally, upon all theſe repreſentations, I may juſtly re-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll and magnifie the dignity of humane nature, which we may conſider ſent down at firſt from Heaven as Gods image: and next, as a ſtate to which God himſelfe did vouchſafe to come down in perſon, and taking it upon him, will inhabit therein eternally, and then, that the holy Spirit of the Father and the Son abideth in it, as in his Temple, which he ſanctifies inceſſantly, nay more that it is deſigned to partake the ſame glory, which the whole Trinity injoyeth, by being promiſed to be <hi>made like him who</hi> hath it all, the God and man <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>So that by the meere light of nature, the mind oftner ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and breakes the object of Divinity, then ſingleth it into unity. This deficiency appeareth in the ſpeculations of moſt of the <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> who all looked naturally upward, for ſome ſupream reference and aſſcription of their being, but unto moſt of them, Heaven like a crack'd mirrour broken by their various imaginations, reflected multiplyed images of the Divinity; whereby we may diſcerne that the perception of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the divine <hi>Eſſence,</hi> is not derived ſo much from the emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the rayes of naturall Reaſon, as from a reception of a ſupernaturall light, whereby reaſon is rather illuminated from
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:115212:31"/>
above it ſelfe, then ſingly producing this ſelfe-illuſtration: and this forrein clarity diffuſed upon our reaſon, is the Grace of the Divine eſſence, which elucidates to our minde the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and indiviſibleneſſe of the object, from whence this gracious ſplendour iſſueth upon our underſtanding.</p>
               <p>Grace thus inſpired, worketh by the ſoule, as light doth by the ſenſe; not inducing the faculty, but only the exerciſe of ſight, for grace doth not conferre any new faculty to the ſoul, but only perfecteth the capacity of naturall reaſon in this act, of ſingling the notion of the Diety, and ſettling the unity of a <hi>Creator</hi> in our beleef. And this firſt poſition alwayes ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth ſome Religion taken largely, as a recognition by ſome exteriour homage of one Supreamacy above our Nature; but this eſtate admits of much diverſity in Religious beliefs; in which, even the wiſe men of the World, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> termeth them, did ſtray and loſe themſelves, <hi>growing vain in their own</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>imaginations,</hi> for by a ſeeming pretext of piety, namely, of making religious addreſſes enough to God, they made many Gods under the colour of one Supream addreſſe. By this Errour we may perceive that naturall reaſon needeth ſtill a further conduct from grace, to lead it to a rectified Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p>Certaine it is, that the materiall and viſible ſpecies of this world, afford ſome notion of the inviſible producer; as in mines, whereof the ſpecificall matter is of a much meaner ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, there are found ſome veines of Gold and Silver; ſo out of the groſſe maſſe of nature, thoſe that work upon it by ſingle reaſon, may eaſily extract ſome Spirituall ore of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for through the elemented body of the univerſe there run ſome veines of intimation of a ſpirituall nature, independent on all matter, which reaſon may diſcerne, and ſo reſolve ſome Religious acknowledgment of a Divine principle, as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer of ſubordinate cauſes and effects, but how apt humane reaſon is to ſever and diſunite this principle, we may eaſily judge, when we remember how ſoone reaſon forgot her owne origine, and as if having loſt the unity of the god-head, ſhe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:115212:31"/>
could in number have made up that loſſe of quality, ſhe brought in all the celeſt all bodies into the account of Divinity, ſerving the <hi>Militia</hi> of Heaven, inſtead of the maker, and we may call to minde that as humane bodies grew Giants, mindes ſeemed to ſhrink into dwarfs; when they fell in love, as I may ſay, with the daughters of men, that is, the concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their owne naturall Reaſon in this point of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity.</p>
               <p>And we may well ſuppoſe that the Giants ſoules, in the law of nature became ſo, by eſpouſing this daughter of God, which we may properly call <hi>Grace,</hi> whereby their heads paſſed the skie, and touched Heaven it ſelfe in this beliefe of the unity of the godhead, and by this conjunction with grace, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon produced their iſſue of a rectified Religion; hence is it that we finde the <hi>Patriarks</hi> frequently viſited by celeſtiall ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, as the allies, as I may ſay, of this daughter of Heaven they had eſpouſed; and moſt doe conclude, that all thoſe, who in the law of nature continued in a rectified belief and worſhip of God, were maintained in that ſtate by grace, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plementall to the virtue of ſingle Reaſon.</p>
               <p>How far humane Reaſon may alone finde the way to recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Religion, is a queſtion to exerciſe curioſity, rather then excite piety; and very commonly, reaſon in the diſquiſition of faith, doth rather ſink the deeper into the earth, by falling from her over aſpiring, then ſhe doth ſix her ſelfe upward in her proper ſtation; and beſides this danger, me thinkes there is this difference betweene them that are working upon reaſon to extract Religion, and thoſe that are feeding upon ſincere faith, that the firſt are labouring the ground for that fruit, which the laſt are feaſting on; or that the firſt are plowing, while the laſt are gathering of Manna. I ſhall indeavour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſerve in this ſpirituall refection ready to be taſted, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of faith, already digeſted, rather then to be provided by ratiocination, for devotion is faith converted into nouriſhment; by which the ſoul contracting a ſound &amp; active ſtrength, needs not ſtudy the compoſition of that aliment, it finds ſo health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>

               <p>

In order to the preſervation of that capacity impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; hence is it that there is no zeale or fervour of ſpirit, which may properly paſſe for Devotion, that is not touched at the teſt of the ſanctuary, which is obedience to the Churches regulations, for many may thinke themſelves in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> diſcipline, in the ferrour of the ſpirit, when they are neerer Saint <hi>Judes</hi> commination of periſhing in the contradiction of <note place="margin">Jude 11. 1 John. 4. 6</note>

               <p>But ſuppoſing the flame of our Devotion to be lighted by a coal from the Altar; the higher it riſeth, the neerer it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to Heaven; for there muſt not be only interiour heat, but exteriour light in it, Saint <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> is a perfect image of <note place="margin">John 5. 35.</note> Devotion, in that Character <hi>Chriſt</hi> gives of him; he was <hi>a burning &amp; a ſhining light,</hi> which ſignifieth internall ſincerity, and active exemplarity; and our Saviour intimates theſe two requiſitions in our Devotion, when he gives us this order, <hi>Let</hi>

                  <hi>your light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good workes, and glorifie your Father which is in Heaven;</hi> wherefore this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept requires not only a fervour, which we feel our ſelves, but a ſplendour that may illuminate others by the edification of our lives.</p>
               <p>When our Saviour ſtateth us as pilgrims in this tranſitory world, he adviſes us to have <hi>our Loynes girl, and our Lights</hi>

Charity, and fervency in the act of our love. And Devotion comprizes fully this equipage for our journey, ſince it collects us, and ſtrengthens us for motion, and is likewiſe that fire which is the beſt ſecurity we can carry with us in our paſſage through the wilderneſſe we travail, to arme us againſt all the wild ſenſualities that lie in our way, ſince it hath this ſpeciall virtue to fright and diſperſe all that is irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</p>
               <p>And this ſpirituall fire hath many analogies with materiall, inſomuch as the holy ſpirit ſayes of it, <hi>The coales thereof are coales of fire, and have a vehement flame;</hi> and me thinkes this <note place="margin">Cant. 8. 6.</note> one remarkable ſimilitude betweene them may be fitly apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>viz.</hi> as fire doth convert many ſubſtances which were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull &amp; unclean, into a matter both generative and clenſing by the conſumption and reduction of them into aſhes, which have both theſe qualities: ſo Devotion by conſuming our paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which were both barren &amp; impure, converts our affections into the love of penance and mortification, which are the aſhes of our conſumed offences, and ſo are made both fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and purging by this converſion into matter of humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by which kind of ſoyling many converts improve much the good ſeed fal'n into their hearts: for that penitent reflexion Devotion makes upon our vaine and foul paſſions and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, (which is the conſumption and incineration of them) becomes purgative by ſincere contrition, and generative of all fruites of Charity, ſince the zeale of mortification is not only a marke of our repentance, but a meanes of our perfection: when holy <hi>David</hi> ſayes, <hi>he eate aſhes like bread,</hi> they were made of his looſe paſſion conſumed by the flame of his Devotion, and ſo converted into ſeeds of penance, and we know how fruitfull theſe aſhes proved to his former ſterility.</p>

               <p>BEcauſe Devotion hath hitherto ſpoke the Language of the Church, it may ſeeme uneaſie unto many to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; therefore I ſhall put it into the vulgar tongue of the Court, and ſo make it more familiar for apprehenſion, and by the warrant of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> condeſcendence to the capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties he wrote unto, I may ſpeak after <hi>the manner of men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi>

               <p>Love raiſed to the height of paſſion, upon humane objects, is a power in our mind, whereon moſt of the world doth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pretend an excellency over others, then plead any excuſe, for ſuch an incapacity in their nature; wherefore this will be an expreſſion of devotion, that will ſerve and fit moſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions. And certainly as ſtrangers doe diſcreetly, to change their habit, when they come to dwell in forreigne parts, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if they be rude and uncivilized; ſo pure devotion (being <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 7.</note> a ſtranger to our carnall nature, which is of it ſelfe wild and undiſciplined, comming to plant it ſelfe, and live with it) may be better ſuited for the purpoſe of introduction with the apparell of paſſion, which is native, then with her owne habit of purity, though more decent and becoming; for this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour

Jude 23.</note> fleſh and blood.</p>
               <p>So that Devotion being thus put into the faſhion, and ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the language of the place it comes to, may hope for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance without much wonder unto our underſtandings, and by acquaintance with them, informing them of the benefits of her aſſociation, may obtaine a plantation in our wills and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; and thus by degrees come to be naturaliz'd in our diſpoſitions; and by this eaſie way of introduction, Devotion may come to get poſſeſſion in ſome minds, by commerce of a good companion, ſooner then by open claime of her owne rights; for we may conclude what right Devotion hath to our mindes, by this, that when prophane paſſion ſeekes to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue it ſelfe, and to poſſeſſe the minds of others, it puts on a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly habit, and ſpeakes the language of Devotion, in reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and adoration; thus, as it were, confeſſing the due intereſt piety hath in our hearts. May not piety then to recover the eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier her due, without irreverence, be put into the lighter figure of paſſion? I may therefore in order to a pious ſucceſſe, propoſe the being devout, under the tearmes of being in love with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, becauſe it is the likelieſt way of perſwaſion to the world, to propoſe not the putting away, but the preferring of their loves, and ſo transferre them to a fairer object, not extinguiſh the fervency of their act; and I believe without any levity of conceipt, that hearts wrought into a tenderneſſe by the lighter flame of nature, are like mettals already running, eaſilier caſt into Devotion then others of a hard and leſſe impreſſive temper, for Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid, <hi>the holy Magdelen changed her object only, not her paſsion;</hi> and one may joyne him with her to authorize this opinion, for love like gold, though it be caſt into an idol, the perverſion of the forme, doth not diſva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue the mettall; and we know the ſame gold that Gods People tooke from his Enemies, in the forme of their idols, after it
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:115212:36"/>
was purged by fire, was conſecrated to the tabernable, and then it ſeemed to have a double capacity of honouring God, as an offering of his ſervants, and as a trophe from enemies; ſo when the flame of the holy Spirit (which is Devotion) hath purged and purified our loves, that were caſt into the images of humane paſſions, the ſame love is ſanctified and aſſigned to Divine Service, and brings a more ſpeciall glory to God, as it is not only an oblation of his children, but alſo a ſpoile of his enemy.</p>
               <p>This is not meant to countenance the alienation of our loves at any time from God, but to commend that diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of nature, where love ſeemes the predominant inſtinct, for certainly ſuch a temper is apter for a right converſion, then a harſh and ſowre conſtitution of the mind, the firſt is a good mould of earth, with ill ſeed caſt into it, and ſo the fruit may be ill, while the pregnancy of the earth is good; the other is <note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 62. In terra de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerta invia &amp; inaquoſa.</note> a heath naturally unfruitfull, and requires much more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuring to make it beare: Wherefore that nature, which hath not a kindly pregnancy in it to beare love, is not the beſt mould for the ſeed in the Goſpell, for though it may render thirty, it can hardly yeeld the increaſe of a hundred fold in Devotion.</p>
               <p>Certainly we may then very religiouſly preferre the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of ſuch mindes, whoſe powers are beſt diſpoſed for the act of loving: for love, as it is the greateſt treaſure of our ſoules, ſo is it the only ſecurity ſtands bound to God for all our debts; all the other faculties of man ſeeme to be receivers only, and this the diſcharger of all their accounts; but love hath this extraordinary bleſſing, the greater expenſe it makes, upon this occaſion, the richer it growes; for the more our love payes God, the more it improves the ſame eſtate; but we can aſſigne nothing but this pure ſpecies of love to the receipt of heaven. Wherefore all empty formalities, and unſincere af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectations in exteriour exerciſes, that would paſſe for Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are, me thinkes, like ſervants, that have got on fine clothes of their Maſters, by which, ſtrangers may miſtake

their quality, but their Maſters are not deceived by them; ſo theſe garments and coverings of Devotion, may abuſe the eye of the world, but we know the maſter of all ſanctity, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes diſſimulation in all the ſpecious ſimilitudes it weareth. And I ſhould beleeve a varniſhed hypocrite may be more offenſive to the ſight of God, then a zealous unvailed idolater, for this, is but miſtaken in God, and the other ſeemeth to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe God may be miſtaken in him: and certainly there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more capitall againſt the lawes of Heaven, then coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting the coyne, (which piety may not improperly be tearmed) as being the price and meaſure of all exchanges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween heaven and earth: of theſe falſe coyners King <hi>David</hi> ſayes, <hi>They ſlatter God with their mouth, &amp; lye unto him with their</hi>

                  <hi>tongues,</hi> and he gives them Gods anſwer, thus, <hi>The Lord ſhall laugh them to ſcorn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may conclude then, that the ſincere love of God, is the ſpirit and ſoul of Devotion, and therefore is to be intire in every ſeverall part of our religious exerciſes: when God dignifies man with ſimilitude to his own image, it is the ſoul, not the body that hath this Divine relation; ſo in the ſervice of God, (which is a conſiſtence of two ſuch parts united of ſpirit and of matter) the ſpirit and breath of life doth not reſide in the materiall part, which is ſenſible religious offices, but in the informing and animating part which is Devotion, the which anſwereth to the ſoule in humanity, as I have endeavoured to demonſtrate. And thus I hope that I have not indecently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell'd Devotion in the habit of the place it is recommended to, clothing it in this <hi>ſoft rayment</hi> of paſſion, being to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>houſes of Kings.</hi>

               <p>But now me thinkes, I heare ſome ſenſuall and voluptuous perſons cry out to warne their paſſions to ſtand upon their guard, objecting that I, like a pyrat, have thus put up friends colours, while I am in chaſe, calling devotion, love and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it might the eaſilyer enter our hearts, which when it hath done, it takes and impriſons all our humane delights.</p>
               <p>To theſe I may anſwer, that I have put up theſe colours in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:115212:37"/>
that thoſe veſſels I would ſpeak with, might not fly from piety at firſt ſight, as from an enemy to pleaſure, that ſpeaking with them, I might ſhew them how Devotion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and poſſeſſing our mindes, doth rather compoſe the munity, then infringe the true liberty of our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>For grace findes Humane Nature (like a veſſell richly fraught for commerce with Heaven) moſt commonly in a mutiny, where the affections that ſhould ſaile her, riſe up againſt their Commander, reſolving to make ſpoile of their commodities, and to turne to the piracy of ſenſe, taking all whereof ſenſuality can poſſeſſe it ſelfe, and if. Devotion <note place="margin">Reaſon.</note> enter and compoſe this ſedition, and convey the affections cheerefully to their direct commerce with Heaven; this may be rather thought a delivery then a violation.</p>
               <p>And ſurely our ſenſes cannot more juſtly complaine of Devotion, as a diſpoſſeſſor of their properties, then wilde people can call a Law-giver a tyrant. For piety doth but regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the functions, not ruine the faculties of our ſenſes; and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſſe cannot more rightly be called the mindes liberty, then nakedneſſe the bodies freedome: For lawes and apparell, doe both in their kinds, cover natures nakedneſſe; and lawes, like clothes, impart conveniencies, (the one to the minde, as the other to the body) without impeaching the decent and proper exerciſes of either: and ſo Devotion doth but reduce the wild multitude of humane affections and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, under the Monarchall Government of the love of God, under which they may enjoy a more convenient freedome, then let looſe in their owne confuſed Anarchy, which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe when they are converted by God to this belief of their condition, that to ſerve God is to raigne.</p>

                  <p>The rectifying our Affections, chiefely our love in the ſenſe of beauty.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>UPon the title of this Chapter, me thinkes I ſee our humane affections ſtand with the ſame perplexed at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, as a condemn'd multitude, at the reading of a Proclamation of Grace, to ſome particular ſpecified names, each one watching and praying for his owne. Thus doe our humane paſſions ſeeme now concerned, believing themſelves all condemn'd by piety, each one me thinkes in a frighted and tacit deprecation of their cenſure, is expecting with anexity to know whether Devotion will allow them life and conſiſtence with her edicts.</p>
               <p>The anſwer to this, muſt be, that I ſhall only put to death, the blind and the lame, whch are commonly ſet to keep the ſtrong hold of our corrupted nature againſt virtue. (As they were upon the walls of <hi>Sion</hi> to keep out <hi>David.)</hi> Such, Devotion muſt deſtroy, <hi>for they are hated by her Soule,</hi> and are not to be admitted into the Temple. Secular juſtice is allowed a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude <note place="margin">2 Kings c. 5.</note> in mercy, to which this ſpirituall judge cannot extend his favour, <hi>viz.</hi> rather to ſave diverſe guilty, then to cut off one innocent; for Devotion muſt rather put to death many innocent affections, then ſave one criminall, by reaſon, that in this caſe mercy renders the judge a complice of the crime,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:115212:38"/>
ſo that our Devotion muſt not looke upon the face of any of our affections, but judge by the teſtimony, our conſcience brings in againſt them.</p>
               <p>Yet piety is not ſo inhumane, as many may apprehend that know not the nature thereof, for it delighteth not in the death of our affections, but deſires rather <hi>they may turne from their perverſions and live,</hi> and to perſwade their converſion, offers that to them in this life, which is promiſed to us, but in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, namely, to have our bodies changed from corruptible and paſſive, into immortall and inpaſſible, for Devotion offers to transfigure our affections from their impure and paſſive ſhapes, into immuculate and imperiſhable formes, &amp; raiſe them up from infirmity to virtue, and make thoſe deſires which have beene <hi>the image of tereſtriall figures, to beare only that of</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe our minds ſeeme to be like fond mothers, which are lamenting their children given over by the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, and will ſcarce hearken to the conſolation of Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, who promiſeth ſo much a better ſtate, as a change from weak infants into Angels. In this manner our fond and effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate mindes ſeeme to bewaile this tranfiguration of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, which Devotion propoſeth according to the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>viz. the raiſing their converſation up to Heaven, and changing their vile body,</hi> ſo that it may be faſhioned like unto the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous quality of the love of God.</p>
               <p>And certainly, unleſſe our affections be cut off from the carnall ſtock of our nature, and ſet by way of ingrafting and inciſion upon the ſtem of the holy Vine, they doe beare but ſowre Grapes, ſuch as will ſet reaſon's teeth on edge, which is their mother, ſince our corrupted nature puts forth many ſharp and unripe cupidities, and fancies which are truly rather corra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive then cordiall to the minde.</p>
               <p>God hath planted affections in our ſenſitive nature, not with a purpoſe that they ſhould be fixed in the earth, and bear only terrene cupidities, but hath rather ſet them there for a while, only as in a ſeminary or nurſery; where he doth not
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:115212:39"/>
meane they ſhould take any deepe root, for our reaſon, as ſoon as it is able, is ordained to remove and tranſplant our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into ſpirituall ſcituations into, that garden for which they were firſt planted, ſo that, although our loves grow at firſt, while they are little tender ſlips, only in the terreſtriall part of our nature, they are deſigned to be removed in their due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon into the celeſtiall portion, and to beare fruites ſpirituall and intellectuall, which order is intimated by the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>as the firſt man is of earth, earthly; ſo the latter muſt be of heaven, heavenly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But becauſe in this warfare of our lives upon earth between theſe two parties, the ſenſitive and the rationall, our ſenſitive nature is not eaſily perſwaded to render up her affections (wherein ſhe accounts her ſelfe ſo ſtrong) unto right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon upon diſcretion, let us examine what faire conditions grace which alwayes taketh Reaſon's part offereth her; and indeed, if the offers be well judged of, there will appeare a truer freedome gained by this ſurrender, then that, which the looſeneſſe of our nature would maintaine, <hi>when our affections</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>being made free from ſinne, are become the ſervants of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> for if we examine the impoſitions and conſtraints our paſſions lay upon us, it is eaſie to convince that to he a reall ſervitude, which we doe familiarly, but in wantoneſſe tearme ſo: and thus our looſe paſſions (like the Jewes, to whom our Saviour propoſed freedome by the knowledge of truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will hardly confeſſe their inthralment; but I may fitly ſay to them, as he did, <hi>while you commit ſinne, you are the ſervants of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">John 8. 34. 36</note> 
                  <hi>ſinne.</hi> If grace by Devotion <hi>ſet you free, you ſhall be free in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore I will procure to manifeſt how grace may give nature great conditions of freedome, and how the beſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties of our affections, are rather improved and ſecured, then alienated and ſpoiled by this ſurrender to Reaſon and Devotion.</p>
               <p>And to treate firſt of the intereſts of love, (which ſeemes to be the commander of all the ſtrength of our paſſions) when
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:115212:39"/>
love renders it ſelfe to Devotion, then is it ſo farre from being reſtrain'd, as it is continued in the command of all the power of our pieties, and is truſted ſo much, as it is allowed to hold faire correſpondence with beauty, though that were the party, love had ſerved under againſt grace, for then our love com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merceth with the creatures, only to improve his owne eſtate and faculty of loving, which is all aſſigned to the honour of the creatour. And ſurely when love by a rectified perſwaſion of the bleſſings of the creature, brings beauty into the ſervice of Devotion, by a right admiration of the workes of the creatour, ſuch objects may forcibly concurre to excite us to the love of the maker, in honouring of whom conſiſts all Devotion.</p>
               <p>Beauty may be truly honoured by the rights of her nature without being flattered, by that meanes to be ſolicited againſt her maker, for ſhe may be confeſſed one of the beſt of all mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed creations, ſince pure ſpirituall ſubſtances, when they will put on a materiall vaile, take beauty for their veſtment. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels expoſe themſelves to us, alwayes in the forme of beauty, becauſe that is the readieſt note our ſenſe acknowledges of Divinity; and when the Son of God vouchſafed to be clothed with materiality, the holy Spirit that made him this Garment, expoſes it and recommends it to us, in this forme of being <hi>beautifull above the ſonnes of men,</hi> and he drawes the image of <note place="margin">Pſal. 44. 3.</note> the ſpouſe he came to take, in the figure of perfect beauty, as the beſt ſenſible Character can be made of her; and makes this quality the object of Chriſts love, <hi>As ſhe is all faire, and no</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Canticle. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>ſpot to be found in her:</hi> and thus, as beauty is choſen for a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol of ſpirituall purity, the allegory of it, as I may ſay, not the letter is to be ſtudyed by us, ſince that attention will reflect to us the faireneſſe and integrity we ought to preſerve in our ſoules, and ſo poſſeſſe us againſt that perverted ſenſe which is often drawne out of the out-ſide or letter of materiall beauty.</p>
               <p>In the Book of Gods Workes, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 20.</note> of the Author is legible by ſome little ſtudy of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:115212:40"/>
and certainly, there is no ſo faire part of this edition, as that of beauty; but we doe moſt commonly, like children, to whom books are given in fine prints, and graced with gay flouriſhed letters, and figures, they turne them over, and play with them, and never learne the wordes; thus likely, doe our childiſh mindes, that are kept at play by our ſenſes, looke wantonly over the ſpecious figures of beauty, and ſeldome ſtudy them to learne Gods meaning in them, which if they did ſeriouſly inquire, they might learne that the excellence and perfection of their true meaning, renders the perverſion the more reproachable, for as crimes are the greater, the neerer they come to the violation of the perſon of the Prince; ſo if beauty be the neereſt ſenſible image of the ſoveraigne of nature, the betraying it to his profeſſed enemy, muſt needs be the moſt capitall offence: how this infidelity is committed, is but too much notified.</p>
               <p>May I not fitly then reproach thoſe with S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who with <hi>vaine flatteries, change the truth of God into a lie,</hi> for is not this <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 25.</note> done by ſuch who corrupt the reall good of beauty, by fond and falſe aſcriptions? And ſurely while they ſerve thus the creature more then the Creator, they provoke God to give them up to their vile affections, in which with <hi>Daniels</hi> Elders, <note place="margin">Dan. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Having overthrown their ſenſe, they turn down their eyes, that they may not ſee heaven.</hi> But the perverſion of this bleſſing, doth not not interdict unto the eyes of the world a due com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with beauty, nor to our ſight the being delighted with it; for as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> wiſheth us, <hi>we may be children in malice,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>and yet men in underſtanding.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If Devotion comming to Court, ſhould declare ſuch a war to the world, as to prohibit ourſenſes commerce with pleaſures; which are the natives of this world, ſhe would find but a ſmall party, upon ſuch a breach to follow her. And indeed, God doth as the Prophet ſayes, <hi>lead us into ſolitude, when he ſpeaks</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Hoſea 2.</note> 
                  <hi>that language</hi> to our hearts, there he ſets on the wings of <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phims,</hi> to thoſe that upon ſuch plumes fly over their paſſage through the world; but thoſe whoſe vocations lead them
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:115212:40"/>
through the tracts of the earth, doe alwayes feele the earth they tread upon, and it is not to be required of them, to leave all the pleaſures of the world in their following of Chriſt; but S. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> inſtructs them ſufficiently in the leſſon he <note place="margin">Luk. 3. 13.</note> gave the ſouldiers, that they ſhould exact no more then is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them, and <hi>be content with thoſe wages of</hi> innocent pleaſures, God allowes their ſenſes in the duties of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>We may then juſtifie Devotion to be ſo farre from inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting to nature the regular love of the creatures, as we may aſſert it the only meanes, whereby we can aſſure the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of our loves to them; for our ſenſitive affections are like the hay and ſtubble the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks of, they are eaſily ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.</note> by every ſpark of pleaſure, but they make onely a ſhort blaze, and goe out againe; whereas Devotion is the <hi>Pſalmiſts oyle of gladneſſe,</hi> and though it raiſe not ſo glaring and ſo ſharp a flame of joy, yet it entertains it in a more equall and durable temper, for notwithſtanding it doth not blaze ſo much in the ſenſitive, yet it warms and recreates more the rationall part of our minds, and ſo doth rather foment then waſte the matter of our joy, which the ſharper flaſhes of our paſſions do quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſume: for truly our affections and paſſions in their owne nature are ſo light and volatile, as beauty it ſelfe, that works beſt upon them, cannot fixe them, nay nor ſtay them, ſo long as even beauty, which is ſo variable, continues the ſame; ſince the ſame vaine love, which to day robs even Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity for offerings to make to beauty, tomorrow commits as great a fault in humanity, ſtripping again his owne Idol, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the motion of inconſtancy, not at all upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of conſcience; ſo that I may fitly apply this of the <hi>Prophet</hi> to ſuch loves, <hi>They weave ſpiders webs, their webs ſhall</hi>

               <p>Thus are our humane paſſions ſo deceived in their commerce, with the vanities of this world, as they break often upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of their adventure; it ſeems our fancies inſure more upon
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:115212:41"/>
fruition, then the commodities are worth we traffique for, and ſo we become loſers even by the return of our adventure, whereas Devotion teacheth us the true value of our deſires and ſucceſſes, and how to adventure our hopes, and how to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the happineſſe of our wiſhes in temporalities, in ſuch ſort as to make a ſtock out of them for eternity, according to the prudent advice given us, to make <hi>friends of the felicities of this</hi>

               </p>
               <p>By theſe lights we ſee how the love of God is not onely compatible, but requiſite with our love of creatures, to aſſure and improve our true delights in them; for nothing but piety can make good to humane appetite, in all temporalities; that abatement of their eſteeme which is made by propriety, and Devotion teacheth us to love them, as gifts of God. By which meanes, fruition makes rather an endearment of them, then a deduction.</p>

And ſo Ambition, is, as it were the title of the prime ſeignory belonging to the Houſe of Pride, which varies only the appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the ſonne, and in this ſence (as Ambition is the heire of Pride) though bearing another name, Devotion can have no confederacy with it; for humility, which hath the ſame relation to piety, that Ambition hath to pride, hath the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of <hi>Jehu,</hi> and is not to be tempted by <hi>Jezabel,</hi> though ſhe be never ſo well colour'd and painted, even the little ones of this houſe muſt be daſhed againſt the ſtones; but humility hath no command to raze and demoliſh the Cities and Palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces this ill generation lived in, which are, honour, fame and power, for piety may lawfully dwell in theſe commodious habitations of the world, and make excellent uſe of all theſe temporall advantages.

all honour is primarily intended by God, as a remuneration of virtue, and it goes ſtill in the world under that name, though this order be never ſo much vitiated by the iniquity of the world, all dignification retaines ſtill the ſame title of the merit of ſome virtue, and thoſe that attend the leaſt to virtue, will not referre their temporall ſucceſſes to leſſe then the adep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them by ſome virtue; inſomuch as even mans corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion atteſts that all honour and dignity is originally the legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate iſſue of virtue, which our mindes are naturally betrothed unto, and confeſſes the generations of fortune to be ſpurious &amp; illegitimate, ſince we wil not leave any of her iſſue under the title of her maternity, but paſſe them all over to ſome virtue, for the owning them.

               <p>Doth not honour and dignity appear plainly by this genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine inſtinct of our aſcribing them to virtue, to be one of Gods deſignments for mans appetency? Wherefore they cannot be diſcredited by Devotion, which is Gods Miniſter, and doth decently marſhall all the faculties of our minde, in the order of humane actions, directing every one by their ſeverall voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to their reſpective properties, aſſigning to Courts and Cloiſters their ſeverall portions, and ſo evidenceth that of the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> that <hi>God hath given every one the manifeſtation of the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>ſpirit, according to the ſeverall utilities he deſignes by them;</hi> and thus, as there are many manſions in our fathers houſe, Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſets every one upon the right ſtaires, that lead up to their peculiar aſſignment. Therefore piety muſt not be ſo much tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the Court, as to be reported quarrelſome with all the family, the proper attendants of the place, namely, glory, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and riches; for it is rather the ſteward God appoints to keep all in decent order. By whoſe conduct the proper luſtre &amp; magnificence of the place may be ſet off, ſo much to the beſt, as it may hold a pious Analogy with the Court of Heaven, as
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:115212:42"/>
well in the whole family, as in the Maſters perſons, who are ſo ſpecially the images of God upon earth; as not only the perſon of <hi>Solomon,</hi> but the order of his Servants, the attendance of his Miniſters, and their apparell may be a good image of the originall glory they repreſent. And ſuch a conſtitution or frame of temporall glory, may be formed by the oeconomy of Devotion, when ſhe manageth the dignities and treaſures of <note place="margin">3 Reg. 10.</note> the world, which commonly are made the ſubject of confuſion and diſorder.</p>
               <p>Devotion may then ſay to the Court of temporall deſires, which paſſe under the notion of Ambition, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> did to his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> in the temptations they were expoſed to, <hi>I pray not</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">John. 17. 15</note>

               <p>As for the preſcribing a courſe of temperance to theſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, this preſent queſtion doth not properly exact it: I hope the reſt of my labours will afford ſome competent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for our regiment of health, according to the aire and diet of the place, for which they ſhall opine. Pride is, indeed, that dangerous diſeaſe, whereunto the conſtitution of the Court is moſt diſpoſed, and the leaſt overheating of Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on turnes it into pride, but truly the matter of this diſeaſe, is rather in the humours, then in the blood, for as no meanneſſe of birth, or miſery of condition are ſure exemptions from pride, ſo not any nobleneſſe, or felicity are conſequent confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of it; for <hi>Solomon</hi> alloweth us to conclude, <hi>that the want of bread doth not ſtarve pride.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 12. 9.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſtian humility doth not prohibit all purſuite of honour, as malignant; or preſcribe poverty, as not at all obnoxious; for we have Chriſts Authority to conclude it a more bleſſed thing to give, then to receive; and the bleſſing he gave to pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, was <hi>to the poore in ſpirit,</hi> and this qualification of the ſpirit, may agree with the eminence of all qualities; for Devotion <note place="margin">Matthew 5.</note> doth not only carry humility with her up to all the heights and ſtories ſhe aſcends, but retaines it alſo; for ſhe lookes upward ſtill at that infinite diſtance ſhe there remaines from heaven,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115212:43"/>
and doth not take meaſure by her elevation above other eſtates, ſhe ſees below her on the ground; this was King <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>

               <p>We may then reſolve, that thoſe who ſhall make their judgement by the Apoſtles <hi>perfect law of liberty,</hi> will finde <note place="margin">James.</note> that the carriage of Devotion, is no clog to the activeneſſe of their thoughts, or motion of their deſires, but rather ſuch a weight as is put to clocks, to regulate, not retard their motion; and certainly, our temporall deſires are to be eſteemed as our watches, not thoſe which goe faſteſt, but thoſe that goe beſt.</p>
               <p>So that one of the chief offices of Devotion in the world, is to regulate, not repreſſe all temporall deſires. Wherefore piety may fitly ſay to our humane affections, in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> termes to the <hi>Galatians, Brethren, you are called into liberty,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>only uſe not liberty for an occaſion to the fleſh, but by love ſerve one another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Devotion</hi> may have ill offices done her by her own friends, by bringing her to Court in ſo ſevere and unſutable a habit, and uncompleaſant lookes, as ſhe may fright the infirmity of ſome well diſpoſed, and fire the malignity of others, and thus faile of a good reception by many that would entertaine her, if ſhe were better ſuted for the place. They never ſaw piety but in one dreſſe, that thinke ſhe cannot ſute her ſelfe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to occaſions, and put her ſelfe ſo farre into the faſhion, as may make her the eaſilier occoſtable, and yet retaine her dignity and decency, her naturall viſage in a Cloiſter, may be a vizard to her in a Court. And ſurely there is nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends Devotion more to the world then to ſee it well ſuited, in the exterior habit, to the ſociety wherewith it is converſant, and the habit changeth no more the naturall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115212:43"/>
of it, then clothes doe the true proportions of the body, wherefore Devotion may lawfully ſuite her ſelfe in ſuch ſort, at her firſt comming to Court, as to cover that which is ſuch an eye-ſore unto our infirme nature, too preſſing a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint upon our naturall affections.</p>
               <p>Did not Saint <hi>James</hi> adviſe Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> to comply with the weakneſſe of the times, and ſurely it may be truly ſaid of Courts, that there are <hi>many which believe, and yet are Zealous of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Acts 21. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>the law</hi> of nature, of the pleaſures and conveniences of the earth, and not to offend ſuch as may have innocent inclinations to ſuch attractives, thoſe that recommend Devotion, may proteſt (againſt their common diſcredit) that they doe not teach the relinquiſhment of all the cuſtomes of the place, but doe admit many of them competent with the ſpirituall lawes of piety. This preſident of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> may be prudently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated, by thoſe that are addreſſed to worke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively upon the ſeverall infirmities of perſons and places; they that can copy well, Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> figure, <hi>of becomming all things to all, that they may gaine all,</hi> ſhall neither avert ſome by the hard favour of ſcruple, nor indanger any by the ſmiles of liberty.</p>
               <p>The precepts of ſpeculative purity, are naturall in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of contemplation, which is recluſeneſſe and ſolitude, but are not alwayes competent with ſociety, there may be a miſapplication of ſpirituall advices, where the matter propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, is excellent in quality, but not adequate in proportion to the place. Of ſuch directions, it may be ſaid as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaid of <hi>Cato</hi> the <hi>Cenſour, that his ſenſe was alwayes excellent, but he did ſometimes indamage the ſtate, becauſe he councelled, as in the republicke of Plato, not a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> in the rubbiſh of Romulus.</hi> So there may be many that may meane excellently, and adviſe very virtuouſly, and yet prejudice the ſtate of humanity when they preſcribe, as if it were ſtill freſh in the purity of <hi>Eden,</hi> not pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted, in the dregges of <hi>Adam:</hi> The fit application of actives to paſſives produceth the beſt effects in grace, as well as nature, ſo that it is ſufficient for the propoſers of Devotion, to anſwer
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:115212:44"/>
as <hi>Solon</hi> did, when he was asked whether he had given his Country the beſt Lawes he could deviſe? he replied, <hi>that he had given the beſt they were likely to take;</hi> by reaſon the uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of pious precepts, conſiſts not in the giving alwayes ſimply the beſt, but relatively the propereſt; as when we ſet fruit, we conſider the earth before we chooſe the plant.</p>
               <p>Vpon theſe grounds, my ſtudy hath been to fit propoſitions of piety to the meaſures I have by experience taken of the world, in which worke I may be more confident of the juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the meaſures taken by my infirmities, then of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of the matter furniſhed by my abilities. I have by Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> adviſe, remembred <hi>thoſe that are in bonds, as having</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>been bound alſo,</hi> (and being ſtill, God knoweth, but working upon other fetters) and if there be any thing that ſeemes lighter colour'd, then the ſolemnneſs of the argument requires; let it not be taken as a voluntary indulgence to any levity, but in order to the ſupport of the <hi>feeble-minded, and comfort of the weake,</hi> by S. <hi>Pauls</hi> direction. <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 5. 14.</note>
               </p>
               <p>When Ambition then is purged from the popular malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy, imputed to that terme, and refer'd only to an aſpiring at dignity &amp; preferment by virtuous addreſſes, I may conclude Devotion and Ambition may live happily together, and yeeld mutuall aides to one another, while Grace furniſheth order, and Nature activity to our ſpirits.</p>
               <p>When piety diſciplineth Ambition, the end of our purſuites is rather in proſpect upon others, then reflection upon our ſelves; and truly, charity and beneficence muſt be the laſt terme of a Chriſtians exaltation, according to the patterne of our head <hi>CHRIST JESUS,</hi> our aſcending up on high, <hi>muſt be coupled with giving gifts unto men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may then reſolve, that when Ambition moves without Devotion, this is an earthly motion, moving upon his owne Center; for then Ambition turnes commonly, at beſt, upon ſelfe-love, and private cupidities; but when it moves with Devotion, then it is a celeſtiall motion, upon anothers Center
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:115212:44"/>
that is, upon the deſigne of a charitable influence on the inferior poſitions of the earth, which is that activeneſſe all Chriſtian Ambition ſhould have, in order to communication of the good whereunto it aſpires.</p>
               <p>And this, as it is a heavenly, ſo is it a circular motion which unites all at laſt unto it ſelfe, that it toucheth in the whole circulation. For as a circle hath every point made in the whole circumference, contained in the perfection of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure; ſo this circle of charity hath every portion of good it hath done, returned into it ſelfe at the compleatment thereof, which is in the cloſure of the circle of our lives: For then the Charities which power hath circumferr'd to others, doe all returne, and become her owne againe, in the perfection of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; wherein conſiſts the conſummation of all power, when by the pious exerciſe of our temporall power, we are preferr'd to an eternall domination.</p>
               <p>By theſe diſcuſſions, I hope to have ſhewne without any le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity or indecency, how love and Ambition are compatible with Devotion and piety; and me thinkes, theſe two are the two great lights of our paſſions; the one ruling over the day, the other over the night in our ſenſitive appetite: ſo that I ſhal not need to bring any of our lower affections in queſtion, which like leſſer ſtars derive their lights from hence; for when once love and ambition, which are, as it were, the heads of the faction againſt the ſpirit, are reduced to the ſervice of Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the other meaner popular affections are eaſily regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>This premiſed, we may conclude, Nature hath ſo little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to complaine of any reſtraint made upon her faculties by grace, as her affections may juſtly make this acknowledgment of the Apoſtle, unto Devotion, (which is Graces miniſter) that it <hi>delivers them from the powers of darkneſſe, and makes them worthy to be partakers of the inheritance of light.</hi>

ſay of the ſpirit of <hi>devotion,</hi> what ſome curious Naturaliſts have vented of a medicinall extraction, they call the ſpirit of the world, which giveth vegetation to all bodies, they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme it to have the vertue of reſtoring nature from decay to integrity, and to preſerve mans body long in an indeficient vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, and propoſe contrary effects produceable by this ſpirit, reſpectively to divers conſtitutions, but ſtill to the benefit and redintegration of nature, in each individuall whereunto it is miniſtred: I may without queſtioning or ſigning this poſition, make this application of it, and affirme that theſe properties are really verified in the virtue of this ſupernatural ſpirit, which I call <hi>Devotion:</hi> ſo that I need not feare what I promiſe, to perſwade the taking it, in that manner I have formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipted it: whereupon I propoſe to every regular uſer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, no leſſe benefit, then the conferring on them their finall deſire in this life, which is comprized under this notion of happineſſe; by which terme we underſtand, the reſting and quieting our mindes in the fruition of goods convenient, and <note place="margin">Happineſſe defined.</note> agreeable to our nature, in which ſtate I propoſe to ſhew, that <hi>Devotion</hi> doth eſtabliſh the minde of man; in order whereunto I may well prefix this Axiome of Saint <hi>Auguſtine, Lord thou haſt made the heart of man for thy ſelfe, and therefore it is alwayes reſtleſſe untill it requieſce in thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nothing hath ſo perplexed the wit of man, as to determine the ſupreame felicity of this life. The Phyloſophers have been ſo divided about it, as they ſeeme to have paſſed their lives in a continuall warre upon one another, in the very trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this generall peace they ſought to eſtabliſh: it ſeemeth Almighty God, in revenge of the partitions and fractions they made of his unity, broke their opinions into ſo many pieces, as they could never joy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Surely God, who ſaw with what preſumption they were building up the deſigne of their ſecurity in this life, by the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:115212:47"/>
modell of their owne naturall Reaſon, ſent this confuſion of opinions, like that of the tongues amongſt them, to ruine that ſtructure of humane felicity, the wiſdome of the world was raiſing for her refuge &amp; ſhelter, againſt the ſtormes of Heaven. And ſo theſe bricklayers of humane happineſſe, (which they may be properlytermed, in reſpect they wrought only upon the matter of the earth, tempered by humane wiſdome, and with that ſtuffe, thought to build up their forts of felicity) were ſtruck from Heaven into this confuſion of language, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed into ſeverall Sects, in which, every one ſpake a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent tongue, and never concurr'd in an intelligence to conſtitute one unanimous poſition touching the ſupreame fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity.</p>
               <p>This point of mans conſtant happineſſe, ſeemeth to be in Morall Philoſophie, the great ſecret, in ſearch whereof moſt of the ſpeculative Sages have imployed their ſtudyes, and have advanced no further then the naturall Philoſophers have done towards finding the famous <hi>Elixir;</hi> for the Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts have made many uſefull diſcoveries by the way; whereby they have compoſed diverſe excellent medicines for the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the minde, but never any of them, though they have much boaſted it, did attaine unto that conſummate virtue, which could ſettle the minde in a perfect tranquillity and inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable temper. This virtuous power in morality, as it anſwereth adequately to thoſe properties the Chymicks attribute to their great worke; ſo is there this Analogy betweene them, that they both ſeeme much more feiſable by their ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative rules, then they are found by practicall experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The ſwelling ſcience of the Ancients, which had never heard of the fall of Humane Nature, grew too well conceited of her ſufficiency, thinking the perverſity and wryneſſe of the ſuperiour part of the minde, to grow only by an ill habit of ſtooping and bending towards the lower portion, which is the ſenſitive appetite; thus the Stoiks concluded, that ſingle reaſon might by the reflex of diſcourſe, ſee this indecent po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115212:47"/>
whereunto cuſtome inclined her; and ſo, by degree rectifie and erect her powers to ſuch a point of ſtraightneſſe, as neither the delights nor the diſtreſſes of the lower and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive part of nature, ſhould ever bowe or decline the evenneſſe and rectitude of the minde; and by this means they arrogated no leſſe to mans ſufficiency, then even the power of remaining in a calme <hi>apathy</hi> and impaſſiveneſſe, in all offenſive emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. But alas, the wiſdome of the world knew nothing of that inward bruiſe our nature had in her fall, which keepeth her too infirme, to be reduced to that perfect activity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto pure ſpeculation might deſigne her; we underſtand that repugnant law in our members, by which, all their imagined tenures of ſecurity were voyded, when they came to their tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; but they underſtood ſo little this law, as what we know to be the defect of frail title, namely, our nature, they took for the ſecurity of their eſtate of peace.</p>
               <p>Me thinkes the Ancient Philoſophers with all their wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and precaution were ſerved by their owne nature, as children uſe to doe one another, at a certaine ſchoole-play, when he that hides, ſtriketh him he holdeth blinded, who being thought out of play is never gueſſed at; and thus did our corrupted Nature while ſhe her ſelfe held them blinded, ſtrike them, and ſhe was never ſuſpected of the blow; but the accidents of fortune were only taken for the ſtrikers, with which ſingly, thoſe Sages thought their mindes were exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing themſelves; for they never miſdoubted this infidelity in Humane Nature, they thought her intirely ſound and ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient, to afford this conſummate tranquillity of ſpirit in all ſeaſons; and thus they were like children kept blinded, and ſtrucken by the ſame hand which they never ſuſpected, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging fortune as a forreine actor, with all thoſe blowes that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked their paſſions. Upon which ground they preſumed on the ſufficiency of naturall Reaſon, even to extinguiſh all paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or diſtemperance in their mindes: but to theſe preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> anſwereth, <hi>While they accounted themſelves wiſe, they became fooles.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:115212:48"/>
And ſurely, theſe Morall Ideas conceived by the Stolkes, may well be coupled with the naturall Ideas, ſuppoſed by the Platonikes; out of which principle, there may be ſome light drawne towards the inquiry into the nature of formes ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted from matter, although the poſition be erroneous. After this ſort, we may derive much clarity, towardes our diſcerning the latitude and power of morall virtue, by theſe maximes of the Stoiks, which are not ſincerely true in their concluſions. I may therefore juſtly bring in this evidence of the wiſeſt of men, againſt this Sect of pure Moraliſts, preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming upon the Stock of naturall wiſdome, <hi>You have ſaid, you</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eccle. 7. 24.</note>

               <p>The felicity of a Chriſtian is ſtated upon a farre different principle, namely, in the perception of the defectiveneſſe of our Nature, as being maimed by her firſt fall, and in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging the inſufficiency of our ſingle Reaſon, to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and compoſe the diſquiets of the mind, without a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall adjunction of Grace; by which we are, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 9.</note> telleth us, <hi>called out of the darkneſſe</hi> of the Phyloſophers, <hi>into this admirable light,</hi> to ſee the curſe that is upon our earth, and to diſcerne that we are not, in this life, Lords of our eaſe, but tillers of this foule earth of our corrupted Nature, which we can never weed ſo perfectly, as to gather out of it a pure and immixed felicity; it is by a ſupernaturall light ſhining in our dark places, that we are inlightned in a right apprehenſion, of what degree of happineſſe we may project in this life; and Grace doth us this good office, by a detecting to us the naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our nature, not by a covering and palliation of her disfigurements; and in the point of eſtabliſhing our happineſſe, Grace may well be ſaid to inſtruct Reaſon as her Diſciple, in the termes of Truth himſelfe to his Diſciples, <hi>Abide in me, and I in you: For, as the branch cannot beare fruit of it ſelfe, except it</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>A conviction of Senſualiſts, declaring how Grace emancipateth us from the bands of the Creatures.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>NExt we will take into conſideration the caſe of thoſe who ſtate the happines of this life in a plentiful fruition of all temporal accomodations; and ſuch are in my mind much eaſier confuted then the former Rationaliſts, we have examined; for theſe, whom I tearm Senſualiſts, may be in great pain and incertainty, to get but ſo much as the ground or ſubject of their happineſſe, which are wealth and ſenſuall pleaſures; whereas the other have the foundation, at leaſt of their work, namely Rectifiable Reaſon, much more attainable by a ſincere purſuite ſo that notwithſtanding they are abuſed in the degree of ſufficiency, they aſſigne to this rational com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure of mind, yet have they alwayes ſome fair proportion of contentment in this attempt; whereas the Sectaryes of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptie, part with their Peace before-hand, upon no ſecurity of their projected ſatisfactions for commonly they are firſt much troubled with an unaſſurance of compaſſing any of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and then in caſe of ſucceſſe, much perplexed in point of preſerving them; and at the beſt, are alwayes diſappointed of ſomewhat they expected, even in the poſſeſſion of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires: Since propriety in our fickle nature, doth deduct much from the prefanfied value of ſuch pretenſions.</p>
               <p>Such therefore as ſtate the felicity of this life in the full and conſtant ſatisfaction of their ſenſes, are much eaſilyer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed then the other we have treated of; for they ſeem to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne the impoſing upon Reaſon, a degree of Paſſiveneſſe, as much lower then it can fall, as the other do aſpire to raiſe it to a point of activity above the ſphere of our vitiated nature; Since the Senſualiſts me thinks pretend to reduce the Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall part of the mind, to as much ſubmiſſion to the ſenſitive
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:115212:49"/>
appetite; As the <hi>Moraliſts</hi> did deſign the quite contrary ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. For they would have Reaſon murmure as little againſt all the appetites and fruitions of the ſenſes, as theſe would have the mind remain unaffected &amp; inviolable by all ſenſible vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; neither of which projects are effectible in our humane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; for experience diſabuſeth us in both theſe propoſals, but moſt eſpecially in this point of ſenſualities, being able to ſuſpend &amp; ſilence reaſon ſo fully, as it ſhal interpoſe no diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et or diſ-ſavour in the eaſes &amp; ſuavityes of corporeal fruitions; for even the higheſt degree of irrational pleaſures, which doth the moſt alienate and ſuppreſſe the acts of Reaſon, are of little continuance, and our reaſon ſoon returnes, and bringeth with her ſuch reproaches as break the entireneſſe of the delight, and ſo leave all voluptuary happynes, at the beſt, but an intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and diſcontinued peece of ſatisfaction. For this interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the reaſonable power of the ſoul, induceth alwayes ſome accuſation of the unreaſonableneſſe of thoſe delights upon which we aſſign our ſelves felicity, and our underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſets our memory very often, even againſt our will, to remember the dignity of our Intellectual nature, which we endeavour to debaſe by a preference of her own natural ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and there is no ſtate of ſenſuall voluptie, ſo wel guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the attendance of all earthly commodityes, whereinto the depreſſed power of Reaſon doth not often get acceſſe, and then it woundeth that tender portion of the mind, we call <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> ſo farre at leaſt, as to manifeſt to us the unſoundneſſe of that ſort of our imagined happineſſe.</p>
               <p>Nay abſtracting from all religious reflexions, doth not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall experiment familiarly teach us, that our ſenſitive nature is not to be truſted, when ſhe propoſeth the ſatisfaction of her appetites, for ſecurity to our happines? Since our carnall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, even in their deareſt ingagements, break their word ſo commonly, and run away, as I may ſay, from thoſe appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites they were contracted to, before they have ſo much excuſe as having attained to their propoſed tearm, to juſtifie their change of deſires, and how ſeldome do our paſſions maintain
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:115212:49"/>
themſelves in any vigor in the ſtate of a lawfull conjunction and fruition of their moſt ſervent purſuits; Nay, doth not a Legitimate propriety, (which in reaſon ſhould indear them) commonly make the right we have to be pleaſed with ſuch poſſeſſions, the onely reaſon of our diſvaluing them? Theſe notorious Infidelities may juſtly evacuate all the title Volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie can claime unto this lifes felicity.</p>
               <p>Muſt we not then reſort to a Superior power, for the ſtabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of our happynes? ſuch a one as may be able to fix our affections, and not leave them in their own naturall trepidati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Retrograde motions, by which we can never keep a true account, even of our deſires? So farre are we from aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our delights, and for the fixing of our volatile Nature, there is no humane art to be conſulted, the Author of Nature reſerveth to himſelfe this great ſecret.</p>
               <p>Since Nature then is ſo diſcredited, in order to this great work, we muſt have recourſe to the peculiar ſecret of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which is <hi>the grace of God infuſed into our hearts by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>

                  <hi>Ghoſt;</hi> By the adviſe whereof, our hearts are taught, not to work upon temporal felicity, (which may aptly be reſembled to quick-ſilver) as <hi>Alchymiſts</hi> do upon this minerall, with a deſigne to fix it, and ſo convert it into earthly treaſure; but as good Phyſitians do, onely in order to the extracting medicines and remedies out of it; And by this Method, as they render <hi>Mercury</hi> beneficiall, by drawing from it ſome good quality, and fixing that upon ſome other body, while that ſubſtance remaineth unfixed and volatile; We may likewiſe, without ſetting our thoughts to work upon temporall goods, in hope to make our happynes by the fixure of them, wel derive great utility from them, by the infuſion of ſome of their virtue, making thereof remedyes for the neceſſityes of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours: Such an extraction <hi>Daniel</hi> counſelled the King to <note place="margin">Dan. 1. 4.</note> draw out of his periſhable felicity, and by this Method, while the matter of worldly goods remaineth fluent and tranſitory, there may be great utility derived even from the conſideration of theſe qualities; For by uſing this matter, according to the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:115212:50"/>
nature of it, by keeping it paſſing and tranſient through our hearts, and hands, we may provide a fixed and eternall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe: This advice is given us by the Author both of Nature and Grace, to make out of the unfaithfull company of this worlds friendſhip, ſuch loyall friends, as ſhall receive us into thoſe tabernacles, where no good is leſſe then eternall.</p>
               <p>This is a practicall uſe, which Devotion will alwayes intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in our temporall poſſeſſions; There is alſo another ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative influence, which it hath in order to the ſettlement of our mind, namely, the frequent meditation on the inſtability of all things ſublunary, which cogitations are pregnant ſeeds of the contempt of this world, whereby we learn to draw the cure of the venome out of the bowels of the beaſt it ſelf, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilling out of the ſerious contemplation of the mutability of all worldly happines, a remedy againſt the evill of that fickle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and impermanency; and by this courſe, we raiſe ſome ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour out of the adverſe party of our own frailty; For they who ponder frequently, how all things ſublunary move continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, in an interchangeable flowing and refluencie, may eaſily learn, not to imbarque their mindes in any earthly delights, never ſo fairly ſecured, without expecting adverſe revolutions and repeales of thoſe joyes; and by this preparation, Devotion doth by degrees teach us to make our peace Poſtable upon all the tides of fortune, underſtanding them to be truly the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of Divine providence.</p>
               <p>This light we can receive onely from the beames of Grace, and they ſhine the clearer in our hearts, the more Devotion is kindled in them; For this Spirituall flame, as it riſeth, alwayes attracteth more of that firſt fire that lighted it; and thus from our affections being inflamed by devotion, our underſtandings take this light, whereby they diſcerne the greateſt ſecurity we can contrive for our contentments in this world, to be the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo prepared for mutations, that our wils may be ſo looſe from anchorage upon any earthly pleaſure, as they remove eaſily from their hold on that delight, and put out to the ſea of Gods providence in all the ſtormes of adverſity; And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering

how <hi>Gods way is in the ſea,</hi> and <hi>his paths in many wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> and <hi>that his foot-ſteps are not to be diſcerned;</hi> Our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may eaſily repaire their earthly loſſes, by that treaſure they may find in this Ocean of Gods will; the riches whereof, we make ours by entring into his will, as often as we are dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out of our own, by the variations of this world; and by this Pious acquieſcence to all viciſſitudes of this life, we ſhall come to a conſtant good habit of mind, as men at ſea obtain an unmoved ſtate of body; for as they do not confirm their health, by the ſteddyneſſe of the veſſell in a calme, but by the cuſtome and habitude of the rowlings and toſſings of it in ſeverall weathers; So ſhall we ſettle the peace of our mind, not by the calme equality of a proſperous condition, but by the acquaintance and inurement to ſeverall adverſe revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; And this is undoubtedly the beſt Method, in point of attaining a good conſtituton of happynes in this life, for King <hi>David</hi> himſelf found little ſecurity in this, <hi>I have ſaid in my</hi>

                  <p>Reſultancies from the meditation of humane frailty, and a reſolving the right of Happy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes as belonging to Devotion.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe ſtate of humane Nature being thus determined, me thinks there may be an excellent medicinall extraction drawn (by prudence directed by Grace) out of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of temporal felicity, in order to the fortifying our minds, which may not improperly be tearmed the Spirit or ſalt of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane frailty, ſince it may work upon the mind, as Phiſitians ſay, thoſe kind of Diaphoretical medicines do upon the body, the which although they do not produce any violent ſweat, yet they clenſe by opening the pores, and keeping the body in a continued tranſpiration and breathing out of the Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; After this manner may our minds be purged and recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by this meditation of our frailty, which notwithſtanding it forceth not out any notorious expreſſions of the contempt of this world, in a ſenſible alteration of our courſe of life, yet it may maintain the mind in a conſtant temper of purifying, by a ſoft evacuating much of the uncleanneſſe of her ſenſitive appetite, through an inſenſible perſpiration of mortifying thoughts; and the proper time to miniſter this receipt, is in the health of our fortune, while we are in an eaſie fruition of the joyes and ſolaces of this life; for then the perſwaſion of their inſecurity holds us looſe from that dangerous adherence which carryeth away our peace along with their removals; but this preſcript looſeth much of the efficacy, when it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; but after our mindes are decayed and infeebled by the ſadneſſe and weight of affliction, becauſe in that eaſe they commonly want that vigor of reaſon, which ſhould cooperate with this remedy, and in that reſpect, what might have been a ſufficient ſtay to our minds, while they ſtood ſtraight and

               <p>But leſt me ſhould conceive happynes to be inconſiſtent with this injunction of continuall fear, we muſt underſtand, that there are two feares reſpecting this world, which may ſtand in morality, anſwering moſt of the properties of the ſame in Divinity, <hi>viz:</hi> a filiall and a ſervile feare, the firſt whereof feareth but as a child of humanity, by the knowledge of the frail Nature of all temporalities; the other, as a ſlave to mundanities, being maſtered and ſubjected by Senſuality; So that the filiall fear riſeth from an ordinate love, and right ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the condition of the Creatures, and the ſervile ſpringeth from a miſpriſion of their Nature, and an undue ſubjection unto them; wherefore this firſt filiall fear, is but virtuous and precautionall, and ſo compatible with a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py conſtitution, for it perplexeth our preſent fruitions, no more then the generall notion of our mortality offendeth our preſent health: the knowledge that we muſt die, doth not make us ſick; no more doth the underſtanding, that our temporary delights are to paſſe away, diſreliſh their preſent ſavour.</p>
               <p>Let this prenotion then of intervenient changes in all our moſt ſecured conditions, of ſtated as requiſite, for the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of tranquility in our mindes, ſince at all times, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall felicity is either going away from us, or we from it; for whatſoever the beſt of our times bring us in their revolutions, they carry us away from them at the ſame time, by the motion of our Mortality; in proof whereof the Spirit of Truth telleth us, <hi>we are but a breath of aire paſsing on and not retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>

               <p>ME thinkes I heare many, very impatient to ſee ſome more ſenſible object of temporall happineſſe, expoſed by Devotion, for our nature is not eaſily drawn to looke off from the delights it ſeeth, as I may ſay, face to face, and turne to thoſe that are <hi>ſeene but darkly as through a glaſſe,</hi> which are the joyes of the other life, ſpeculated only <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.</note> through the perſpective of faith; I will not therefore propoſe to thoſe vocations which are the addreſſe of my perſwaſions, the putting their nature into any ſevere ſtraights or preſſures, in hope only of remote reverſions. I will aſſigne preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies for the entertainment of our nature, and over-pay by good ſecurity of ſincere ſecular joy, what may ſeeme taken away in that adulterate ſpecies, wherein our fancies uſe to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the receites of our contentment: For ſurely Devotion
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:115212:53"/>
doth aſſigne the minde a rectified joy, in the uſe of temporall goods, inſtead of that vitious and counterfeit, which our three enemies (pretending to be our ſtewards) bring into our fancy that is prone, to take all, whatſoever hath but the image of ſenſible pleaſure, without examining the ſubſtance; which facility to be deceived, the Prophet reproacheth in us, ſaying, <hi>We ſell our ſelves for nothing.</hi>

               <p>Should a traveller paſſing through a forreign countrey, finding the coyne of the place raiſed to an exceſſive value, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change into it all the good ſpecies of his own, thinking to make gain by this traffique, becauſe the coyne is currant in his paſſage; as ſoon as he were paſſed that dominion, he would quickly repent his inconſiderate miſtake; This ſeemeth to be the familiar caſe of man, who while he is in his tranſition and paſſage through this world, findeth the temporalities thereof, (which are the currant ſpecies of the place) cried up to ſuch an over-value, as he is perſwaded to turne all his affections into that ſpecies of joy, and at its iſſue out of this forreign re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, he findeth the irreparable loſſe he hath made by the debatement of his talents in this exchange: And it is againſt this deluſion, not againſt all commerce with ſecular joy in our journey, that Devotion iſſueth to us her inhibitions, leſt by this ill husbandry in their way, when they come to account with their great Creditor, they be reduced to give a worſe anſwer then he, who brought back his talent unimproved: I ſhall therefore exhibite to our minds (which muſt needs nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate in their paſſage through this world) the true Intrinſique value of thoſe joyes, uttered in the commerce with the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that taking none but ſuch as are allowed in their laſt audict, their traffique may bring home into their native coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey not their Bonds forfeited, but rather Bils of exchange payable upon their Maſters joy.</p>
               <p>In anſwer then of the deſire of having the trueſt happyneſſe of this life, ſpecially determined; I declare that <hi>the felicity of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Felicity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</note> 
                  <hi>this life conſiſteth in a conſtant rejoycing in truth:</hi> This is the aſſertion of Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and is eaſily verified to all ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:115212:54"/>
diſpoſitions; The firſt reply the world is like to make to this propoſition, is <hi>Pilates</hi> queſtion, <hi>What is truth?</hi> to which <note place="margin">John 18. 38.</note> I anſwer,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Truth is a perfect and edequate ſimilitude or likeneſſe, imprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Truth defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> 
                  <hi>in our underſtanding of the nature of the thing we conceive;</hi> So that when our conception is juſt equall to the being and property of the thing we conceive, we are ſaid to underſtand truth. Wherefore the truth of knowing, is as it were the mould caſt off from the truth of being, or the print of that ſeal, and ſo the image of the true being of a thing, is the figure of truth ſeated in our minds.</p>
               <p>But this, which may ſeem a fair impreſſion of the nature of truth, may perchance appear but a dark Character of the form of happyneſſe to my auditory, unto whom indeed I do not intend to aſſigne onely the ſpeculative notions of verities for the ſubject of their ſatisfactions; but I will open farther this ſtore of joy, <hi>(the rejoycing in truth)</hi> and ſhew how it contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Prophets <hi>wine and milk,</hi> which he offereth to all for <note place="margin">Eſay 55.</note> fetching it; From hence the contemplative life draweth that wine, whereof <hi>King David</hi> ſaith, <hi>My chalice inebriating how</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 22. 1 Pet. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>goodly is it;</hi> and the active ſucketh that milk, which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith is proper for their vocation, which nouriſheth their minds with more ſenſible delectation iſſuing from the true uſe and ordinate love of the creature; And this is that, I may not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſantly call the milk which theſe <hi>Gentiles</hi> love beſt, to whom I preſent my breaſt.</p>
               <p>The preference of the contemplative life, before the active, is inferred from this reſpect, of affording a more clear and ſerene light, for the perception of Supernatural verityes; For contemplation is a fixure of the mind on the aſpect and <note place="margin">Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion defined.</note> preſents of truth: and although this act of contemplating be purely Intellectuall, yet the terme and end thereof reſts in the affections, as the poſſeſſion of our purſuits induceth joy; whereby this is demonſtrated, that the happyneſſe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative life conſiſteth in the rejoycing in truth; This ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble delight in contemplation flowing from the Superior por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:115212:54"/>
of the mind down upon the Inferior, is a good Image of mans conſummate Beatitude in Heaven; where the glory of the body is derived from the exceſſe and redundancy of the joy and bleſſedneſſe flowing from the ſoul; and in this order, the delight imparted to our affections by contemplation, fals from a ſuperfluence of truth in our underſtanding. And thus, what may be ſaid to be light in the Superior region of the Soul, ſeemeth fire in the lower; The firſt reporting to truth, and the latter to joy; which as it is a paſſion in our nature, may be ſaid to be more materiall then the other in the ſame degree, as flame is leſſe pure then the radiancy of the Sunne; but the comparative degrees of purity, between the acts of our Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and our affections are not our Theam. Certaine it is, that all the ſenſible delectation of the contemplative life, ſtreameth from the ſprings of Supernatural verities; we will therefore ſtay no longer on the top of Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> which may ſeem all cloud to thoſe that are below, while the <hi>Moſeſes</hi> that are upon it, find all ſplendor and clarity, and may not unfitly be ſaid to ſee the hinder parts of that verity, in ſeeing the face whereof, conſiſts the conſummate rejoycing.</p>
               <p>Comming then down into the Camp of the active life, it will be no hard task to prove the happineſſe of that ſtate like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, ſeated in the rejoycing in truth, which hath ſo gratefull a ſavour even to our ſenſitive appetite, as I may ſay, none wiſh for quailes, but they deſire to taſt this Manna in them; I mean no body affecteth any ſenſible fruition, but as it is under the form of a true good: For as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> reaſoneth, let any be asked, whether he had rather joy in truth or in falſity, and the anſwer will bear no doubt; For although there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny would deceive others in their happineſſe, there are none would be deceived themſelves in it, there is ſuch a ſignature of the light of the countenance of verity, ſtamped upon the reaſon of man, as his underſtanding can propoſe nothing to his affections as matter of joy, but under the colour at leaſt of truth; So that the object of all our affections is true delight, though the errour be never ſo great in the ſubject of our joy:
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:115212:55"/>
For no body can rejoyce under this notion of being deceived, the inſtinct of man is ſuch, in order to truth, as he muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that object to his Imagination, even out of the errour it ſelf he rejoyceth in, ſo Eſſentiall is truth, for the terme of his acquieſcence.</p>
               <p>Suppoſing we do thus generally aim at truth for our felicity, I may well be asked, how it commeth to paſſe, that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our joyes is oftener apparence and falſity, then the real good of this life's benedictions? the cauſe ſurely is, the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of our imagination towards our ſenſitive appetite, rather then in favour to our reaſon; and thus Opinion, which is but a changeling introduced by Senſe, paſſeth commonly for the right child; and certainly, Opinion may well be ſaid to be the mean iſſue of ſenſe, and Verity, the noble child of Reaſon; but by this unjuſtice of our imagination, it followeth, that all the delights which are touched but at our ſenſes, are commonly accepted by our will for the true ſpecies of joy, from the credit of that teſt, without examining their nature in the fire of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiocination; whereby it happens, that when we are the trulyeſt deceived, we are moſt believing in the truth of our happyneſſe; for when we miſapprehend the moſt the nature of ſecular plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, having the leaſt ſuſpition or ſcruple of the mutability of ſuch fruitions, our joy ſeemeth the moſt ſincere, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth clearly, that truth is but miſtaken in the colouring, not unintended in the deſigne of our felicity.</p>
               <p>In redreſſe of this error, Devotion taketh off the deceitfull colours of good and evill, which Opinion layes upon the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and preſenteth to our underſtanding a naturall image both of the worth as well as the vanity which may be found in the rectified or vitious apprehenſion of all temporalities, &amp; poſſeſſing us with the true nature of all our poſſeſſions, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us how to rejoyce in the truth of ſuch bleſſings, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſatisfyeth that inſtinct of the mind with the reality, and doth not amuſe it with the meer colour of verity.</p>
               <p>Certaine it is, that temporall bleſſings, as health, beauty, wealth, and honour, are indued with a true and ſincere good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:115212:55"/>
wherein their owners may vertuouſly rejoyce: the point is, the diſcernment of this Truth, and the ſelecting that, only for ſubject of our delectation: becauſe juſt as much as we ſtray from this principle, ſo much we remove from our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe; which depending on the ſatisfaction of our opinion, if that be unſound, in apprehending the nature of ſuch goods as are the objects of our affections; we are in danger of being unhappy, by their being but true to their owne nature, while we are untrue to ours: For their true inſtinct is mutation and inſtability; and ours, the perception and uſe of that verity: whereby our underſtanding may ſort <hi>an affection proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to the nature of ſecular benedictions.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>THe ſtates of many the deareſt friends of God, teſtifie that temporall felicity affordeth a ſincere matter of joy, which is commenſurate to the true ſenſe concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the nature of ſuch happineſſe. <hi>Abrahams</hi> wealth was thought worthy the holy Ghoſts mentioning as a bleſſing, &amp; as his peregrination was fitted with great accommodations; ſo that ſtate of unſettledneſſe was a fixing in his minde, the true nature of all he poſſeſſed. In proof whereof, it may well be obſerved, that the only purchaſe <hi>Abraham</hi> made upon <note place="margin">Gen. 23.</note> earth with his riches, was a grave; from whence we may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, how rightly he underſtood the truth of their tranſitory nature, and his owne mutable condition; whereupon he choſe to take poſſeſſion of the Land, promiſed him by a marke of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:115212:56"/>
his parting with it, rather then of his poſſeſſing it: thus did he, underſtanding the true goodneſſe of his worldly commodities, derive from them, both exerciſes of charity, and notions of mortification, while he imployed his wealth, in the accommodations of ſtrangers and paſſengers, and in proviſion of his owne lodging, as a traveller at the end of his journey: and remaining in this rectified ſenſe of his tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall fruitions, all their effects proved a conſtant rejoycing in Truth.</p>
               <p>By this method <hi>Abraham</hi> extracted the ſame Spirit of Truth, out of his plentifull ſubſtance that <hi>Lazarus</hi> did out of his penury and indigence; and ſurely, if <hi>Dives</hi> had rejoyced but in the truth of his abundance, and not ſet his heart upon the falſe part thereof, he would have taken <hi>Lazarus</hi> into his breaſt in this life, &amp; then they might have been bed-fellowes in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> Boſome. For I may truly affirme, that there is no <hi>Lazarus</hi> in this world, who hath not an <hi>Abraham</hi> in his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, that ſhall get to the being in <hi>Abrahams</hi> Boſome in the next: And likewiſe conclude, that there is no <hi>Dives</hi> in this life, who hath a <hi>Lazarus</hi> in his boſome, that ſhall not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to <hi>Abrahams</hi> Boſome in the other world: For there is no neceſſitous body, wanting fidelity of heart, and poverty of ſpirit, that can be qualified for that ſtate meerely by his miſery; and there is no ſo ſplendid or opulent perſon, indued with true Chriſtian poverty of ſpirit, that is not thereby intitled to eternall felicity: and ſurely, as there are many <hi>Lazaruſſes,</hi> who want this kind of <hi>Abraham</hi> I have explained in their heart; ſo there are diverſe <hi>Abrahams</hi> in this life, as I may terme them, who carry this ſort of <hi>Lazarus</hi> in their boſome, being both rich, humble, and faithfull, contriving all their tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry joy, out of the perception and dilection of the true bleſſing; intended in the Creature, and deduce their ſatisfaction from Gods order, not their owne exaltation, in which reſpect they may be proved to rejoyce in verity.</p>
               <p>Did not holy <hi>Job</hi> rejoyce in the truth of his worldly goods, when he aſſigned the moſt of them to ſacrifices, either expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory

for his children, or propitiatory for himſelfe, to purge the exceſſes of feaſting in his owne family, or to provide againſt the exigences of faſting in the houſes of his neighbours? acting this part which the holy Spirit gives the potent; ſaying, <hi>the portion of the poore is in the rich mans hands;</hi> and ſurely we may conceive that in the latter part of his life, (which I may call his temporall reſurrection, his eſtate riſing againe to more glory then it had expired with) his piety was alſo exalted in proportion to a higher ſtate of perfection; ſo that truth being found and acknowledged in any ſplendid condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will keepe <hi>Peace and righteouſneſſe in the family kiſsing</hi>

               <p>Firſt we ought to believe ſteadily Gods providence in all the various contingencies that ſeem to ſhake humane reaſon: Next, our prayer muſt not waver between the deſire of <hi>this wiſdome, which brings all other good with it,</hi> and the affectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on principally of ſome peculiar good we deſigne for our feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, for this is an heſitation in faith, when we do poſitively elect any temporall fruition for our happineſſe, becauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

               <p>But I deſire it may be remembred that the meanes I propoſe of obtaining happineſſe by prayer, is not the fervency of the ſpirit in ſuch petitions, as the fleſh doth commonly indite, namely, an attaining either riches, honour, or the like tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall commodities; but in that ſincere ardor of the ſoul, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the impetration of ſuch a fervent love of God, as indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth a compoſure and ſteadineſſe of mind, equalling and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing our wils with our conditions, and by that meanes keeping the peace of our mind volubile and concentrick with the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Divine providence; and this is an effect of that wiſdome onely which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> Saint <hi>James</hi> ſayes, <hi>deſcends from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,</hi> and is aſſigned for all thoſe that ask it, without heſitation in faith, or duplicity of mind.</p>

               <p>Nevertheleſſe, even they who are diſcharged of any weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſolicitude in this world, muſt not expect ſuch a fixure and ſteadineſſe of their minds, as not to feel the motions of our fluent unſteady nature, which heaveth and ſets a little, even in our greateſt calmes: This is that emotion and unevenneſſe whereunto Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaies, <hi>even thoſe who have the firſt fruits</hi>

               <p>Wherefore they muſt not conclude this advice defective, who do not attain to ſuch an evenneſſe of peace by prayer, as they figure to themſelves, reſting without any breath of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet to ſhake thoſe leaves of paſſions, which hang upon the ſtock of our nature, but muſt conclude, ſuch agitations of the ſenſitive part of their ſoules no leſſe naturall then wind in the middle region of the ayre, for Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tells us what we find by familiar experience, that <hi>we have our treaſure not in earthen veſſels;</hi> ſo that to be troubled, but not diſtreſſed; to be vexed, <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.</note> and not vitiated, is the beſt eſtabliſhment of happyneſſe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent with this ſtate of our Peregrination; and this degree
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:115212:64"/>
of tranquility of ſpirit is to be attained by petition to him, whom the ſea, and the windes of humane frailtyes obey upon his rebuking them.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (who had learn'd to be equally content in all <note place="margin">Phil. 4.</note> eſtates of abundance, and abaſement) did not find this ſcience at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> but rather upon his own knees at <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus,</hi> when, <hi>Behold he prayes,</hi> was alledged for the reaſon of his relief; and by uſing his own preſcription of <hi>Pray continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,</hi> he attained to ſuch a ſtrong habit of mind, as preſerved his equanimity in all the inequalities of his conditions. For when in one day, the ſame hands that would have ſacrificed to him as a God, did ſacrifice him to their own evill ſpirits; he tore his clothes with more emotion of ſpirit when he was vainly to be Deifi'd, then he ſuffered the tearing of his fleſh when he was thus unjuſtly damnifi'd.</p>
               <p>This patern in one part affords us a fair copie of the muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of humane nature in her own current, and in the other a draught of that conſtancy may be ſuperinduced upon it, by this intervention of grace, which is attracted naturally by the aſpirations of prayer, according to what the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> tells us, <hi>I opened my mouth, and I drew in thy Spirit;</hi> I may therefore hope to have acquitted my ſelf of ſuch direction as was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite <note place="margin">Pſal.</note> for attaining the poſſeſſion of that truth wherin I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted happineſſe, and my way is ſo acceſſible, it lies as neer every one as their own wil, which is affirmed by the <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Open thy mouth and I will fill it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This conſidered, I may expect the perſwading ſome at Court to be ſuitors to God for Devotion, concurrently with all their other ſuites; ſince in all the fortunes they can make they cannot unmake fortune: For the variable temper of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane felicities, is not to corrected and fixed. Since they cannot then ſtay what is tranſitory, let them attend to arreſt that which is fixable, which is a good degree of peaceable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcence of ſpirit, in all tranſitory events; and as no tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralities can conferre this ſpirit, ſo no contingencies can ſequeſter it, for it is the ſpirit of Truth, that ſtayes our minde;
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:115212:65"/>
which partly is compoſed of the knowledge, and expectance of alternative variations in temporalities; and hence it is, that in all adverſe changes, this ſpirit is rather in action and practice of his owne conſtant nature, then in ſuffering or paſſion, with the fraile nature of temporall mutations.</p>

                  <p>The beſt Notion of Courts propoſed.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> all the Rites and Ceremonies were not only declaratory formes of the preſent Religion, but ſignificative figures of a future ſtate; and howſoever, moſt of the vulgar looked no farther then the gloſſe and luſtre of the exterior vaile, which was the beauty and decency of the forme, and order that affected them; yet the nobler ſort paſſed their ſight through that vaile, and fixed it upon the ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:115212:65"/>
and myſterie it ſelfe, and thereby, had not only their eye of ſenſe delighted, but that of their underſtanding enlightned by theſe objects.</p>
               <p>In reference whereunto I may hope not improperly to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply theſe conſiderations to the Courts of Princes, ſince all the exteriour ſtate of Ceremony and Reverence (being truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived) is ſignificative as referr'd to the images of God, and thus all the diſtinguiſhed ranks of honour, which compoſe the formall order of Courts, are figures of thoſe different degrees of Miniſters, which attend their Originall, the King of Kings: and in this order, the Glory and Majeſty which exteriorly in all ſorts, reſideth about the perſons of Princes, may be fitly underſtood to repreſent (in ſuch ſhaddowes as theſe materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alities can make) the celeſtiall magnificence of the King of Heaven: ſo that one who will interpret religiouſly the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Princes Courts, may ſay, <hi>all things befall them in</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>figures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But certaine it is, there are many in Courts, who determine and center their thoughts upon the fronts and out-ſides of theſe manſions, which are honour, riches, &amp; pleaſure, and raiſe all their Devotions to the place upon thoſe objects, (and ſuch are truly the meaner ſort of Courtiers, though they be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt in the meaſure of the world) and there are ſome of the other party, who penetrate into the religious ſenſe of theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour figures, and derive from them, ſpirituall conceptions and appetities; concluding by theſe glories, (which are but the ſhaddowes of thoſe they ſignifie that the ſubſtance it ſelf muſt needs be <hi>above what eye hath ſeene, or eare heard, or hath entred into the heart of Man;</hi> and ſo by this view are quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in their ambition, towards thoſe originall honours; and theſe are the nobility of Courts, though they be never ſo infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour in office.</p>
               <p>Of theſe two kindes of Courtiers is verified, <hi>The firſt ſhall be</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>laſt, and the laſt firſt.</hi> And likewiſe of the firſt ſort we may ſay, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith of the Law, <hi>the Letter kils.</hi> If the litte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſenſe of the faire text of this worlds glories take up and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:115212:66"/>
fix their mindes; and of the latter ſort <hi>the ſpirit quickens,</hi> when out of theſe ſpecious objects they extract a ſpirituall ſenſe, which excites in them a celeſtiall aſpiring and emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Such a figurative conception Saint <hi>Fulgentius</hi> framed out of theſe images, when he was asked, whether the beauty and Majeſty of <hi>Rome</hi> did not worke upon his affections? he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>If terreſtriall Rome be ſo beautifull, how glorious muſt be celeſtiall Jeruſalem?</hi> His minde was ſo little taken or retarded on her way, as ſhe ſtayd not at all in the outward Court of the Gentiles, but paſſed on, as in her way through it, to the <hi>Holy of Holies;</hi> and by this method, who attend the offices of their mindes upon earth, and waite not upon the places of their bodies, concluding that they are but ſtrangers, and paſſengers through theſe courts, and <hi>Fellow-citizens of the Saints, and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ephe. 2. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Domeſtikes of God;</hi> make excellent uſe of all the luſtrous, and poliſhed glories of the place: for inſtead of looking on them as flattering glaſſes, and mirrours which reflect only the materiall beauty of the earth, they make opticke glaſſes of them, through which, they do the eaſilier take the height of the celeſtiall glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: and ſurely, the ſight of our minde is much helped by ſuch materiall inſtruments, in the ſpeculation of ſpiritualities, by reaſon that in this her priſon, all the intelligence of our minde with immaterialities, paſſeth as I may ſay, through her keepers hands, which are her ſenſes, that can carry nothing but corporeall images to her; and therefore we ſee the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> Saint <hi>John</hi> drawes the image of the court of heaven, in ſuch <note place="margin">Revel. 21.</note> colours as are moſt viſible and moſt affecting in the Courts of the earth; whereby to raiſe our imaginations upon theſe ſteps, which they can tread upon to ſome proportionate concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch fruitions, as are truly all ſpirituall, and Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall.</p>
               <p>And under this notion, all the luſters and ſplendors of Courts, (being underſtood as figures of the ſublimer, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer ſtate of the Kingdome of heaven) are convenient aſcents for our weak apprehenſions to riſe up to the love and eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:115212:66"/>
of theſe ſpirituall objects; for the ſame affections which move us ſo ſtrongly in the valuation of the ſtate of Princes, may work upon us towards the purſuite of that condition, which is propoſed to us, of ſitting on the throne with the King of kings, and enjoying more Majeſty and pleaſure then we can wiſh in this life, by ſuch little paterns preſented to our appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites. Nay by this order, even the vanities and exceſſes of this world (which were ſtumbling blocks to our minds as long as they looked but upon them, and not through them) are by this perſpection and through light laid under our feet, and made ſteps or gradations for our minds to aſcend the eaſilyer even to the contempt of them, and the contemplating the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and ſecure glories of our Spirituall Coronation.</p>
               <p>And ſince, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, <hi>We ſee now but through a</hi>

               <p>This was in the Monarchy of <hi>Lucifer</hi> over the world, when moſt Princes lived like his vice-Kings; but ſince this Tyrant hath been depoſed by our King of kings, who took <note place="margin">Luke 3.</note> not all the Kingdomes of the earth of him upon the termes that uſurper offered him, but diſpoſſeſſed him of them by his own right, and inveſted his Deputies in the Crowns of the earth; by which act Chriſtian Princes are now lnaugurated

                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:115212:68"/>
There is me thinks ſuch a difference between any noted vitiouſneſſe in Princes, and a much greater depravation in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons, as is between the Maligne influence of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, or the Celeſtiall bodies, and the poyſon of plants and minerals; for although the ill of the firſt be not ſimply ſo great, <hi>viz:</hi> intenſively ſo mortal in the operation, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering this circumſtance of the extenſive quality of it, that the malignity hath a generall influence, and offends imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptibly, and ſo is leſſe evitable, in theſe regards it may be counted the greater nocency in nature: So the lives of Princes have ſuch an univerſall influence upon their Court, (at leaſt) as a ſmall infection thus ſpread by them, may be eſteemed a greater ill, then the rank poyſonous lives of ſuch whoſe examples are not operative; and this rule holds in all Courtiers deſcending in proportion to their ſeveral degrees, ſince all of them according to their reſpective magnitudes, have like the leſſer ſtarres, ſome power of inſinuating their tempers to their dependencies; ſince our intereſted nature doth commonly, as the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſaies, do ſome worſhip to all the <hi>militia</hi> of <hi>this fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament,</hi> reſpectively to that fertility of the earth, they are likely to impart to us; for as among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> there were leſſer gods for ſeverall ſpeciall neceſſities, houſhold as well as temple gods: ſo in Courts, there are ſuperior powers of many ſiſes, that have votaries proportionate to ſuch powers.</p>
               <p>Conſidering then the communicative felicity which Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have of their diſpoſitions, ought they not to be moſt cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and tender of this higheſt Prerogative? which is, to impoſe virtue by their practice of it, &amp; this Spirituall levy made upon the mindes of the people, facilitates the raiſing upon them all other tributes.</p>
               <p>Therefore Princes ſhould be as religious in their lives, as they are politickly juſt in their coines; they muſt take heed of crying up any baſe ſpecies to an over-value, ſince their ſtamp and impreſſion makes all their morall coyne ſo currant in their Court, by reaſon the images of their humor, are as it were privy ſeales for the receit of thoſe images wherewith their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:115212:68"/>
are moſt affected: and becauſe it is no crime to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit this kinde of the Princes ſignature, but rather a warrant for their pretenſions, likely the whole Court is a ſtamp of the Kings humour and affection.</p>
               <p>This influence of Princes, upon the diſpoſitions of their Courts, needs not the depoſition of examples, ſince it hath the Authority of a knowne principle; therefore I ſhall only offer one precedent in the caſe, in which the example and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy is ſo ſingular, as the very foulneſſe of the Teſtimony muſt make the proofe the fairer, and the more irrefragable. There was a Grecian Emperour, called <hi>Conſtantinus,</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Copronimus,</hi> which Surname he gave himſelfe before he could <note place="margin">He fouled the font in which he was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</note> ſpeake, when he was firſt brought into the Church, by fouling it as much as his nature could then extend unto; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, his life was a truer performance of that unclean promiſe he made himſelfe, then of thoſe bonds of Chriſtianity, and purity he entered into by his ſureties: for this firſt was the leaſt uncleanneſſe wherewith he polluted the Church in the reſt of his life. This Emperour (who ſeemed to have a ſoule meerely vegetative, by the inclinations of it, (for it grew, &amp; thrived on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon dung) had ſuch a fancy to the ſmell of horſe-dung, as he beſmeared himſelfe with it; and all his Court in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency to that fancy, qualified themſelves for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with the ſame per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:115212:70"/>
Princes may be ſaid to worke upon the image of their mindes, by ſitting to them, that is, by expoſing their owne figure to the young fancy, they draw the other to that reſemblance; ſuch is the active virtue of example upon the tender age of educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Surely thoſe then who are truſted with this office, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a familiar object to young Princes, (which is a nobler place then they can conceive by any name it hath at Court) ſhould ſet their diſpoſitions in a virtuous poſture, knowing they are working upon Gods moſt ſpeciall image, and that they are to be accountable for what diſ-figurements in that forme their workes ſhall occaſion: So that taking Courtiers under this notion, one may advice them a good uſe of flattery; which is, to flatter the figure of their own humours, and inclinations, to make them as good, and gracious an object as they can, though they be not ſo like their nature; to the end the exterior repreſentation, which workes upon Princes, may be proper for imitation; this favouring their minds, in the colouring of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, is more conſcientious then the expoſing the naturall ill complexion of them, before young Princes; for when the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary part, (which only workes upon their minds) is faire, and vertuous; the un-ſincereneſſe of it for the preſent, can have no ill operation on them, becauſe thoſe eyes do not penetrate farther then the ſuperficies of goodneſſe; and ſo peradventure the very flatterd pictures of vertue may work ſuch an impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon Princes in their youth, as they may derive the love of truth, even from the face of diſſimulation. For as a beautifull Curtizan may be a fit object for a Painter, whereby to make a good image of a Saint by, ſeeing he takes only the lovely ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies for his pattern; ſo, even the faire gloſſe of a counterfeit ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, may be a convenient object for youth, which commonly only copies the aſpect, and countenance of ſuch expoſures.</p>
               <p>Upon all theſe conſiderations methinks this may be a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous rule for both ſorts of great Courtiers: <hi>viz.</hi> That Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors ſhould adviſe Kings, as if they thought them inveſted with the Prerogative of their originall, to wit, of the knowledge of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:115212:70"/>
hearts, and companions ſhould live with young Princes, as if they thought they could not diſcover their hearts, but by their lives before them. This rule will produce ſincerity in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and exemplarity in the latter, which are the two things whereby Kings who are in age of Government, and Princes who are in years of Diſcipline, are the moſt advantaged; and ſo may be ſaid to be theſe, the mediate conveyances, by which God gives <hi>judgement to the King, and righteouſneſſe to the Kings</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>TO this Map which I have preſented the Court of her owne ſtate, it will be expedient to adde ſome lines, by which, as by a kinde of ſcale of miles, Courtiers may take their meaſures, and learne the diſtances betweene their dominion, and the ſtate of perfect Chriſtianity, and by that meanes have ſome direction in their way, to the next adjacent Kingdome, of which I have ſhewed their region, to be a very pregnant type, for <hi>I have ſaid you are Gods,</hi> maketh their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations a moſt ſpeciall figure of Heaven.</p>
               <p>Whereupon I conceive this adviſe in the firſt place, to be very pertinent, towards the ſeaſoning our minde with a grave and reverend tincture of the nature of Courts, to conſider them as a figure of the celeſtiall manſions, in thoſe reſpects I have exhibited, becauſe this firſt ſtamp being impreſt on our mindes, may give us a ſober and modeſt image of our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Courts, which may perſwade us, that we are not placed there by God, as officers to our fortunes, which terminate in this world, but rather as Miniſters, in that order upon earth; by which God doth figure out to us the conſtitution of the ſtate of his owne Majeſty: whereby we may reſolve that our

               <p>This animadverſion then is very important for all Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers to eſteeme themſelves, called to a laborious vocation, and not reſting in a licenced vacancy from labour: for though they doe not eate their bread in the ſweat of their browes, they doe it in the ſweat of their braine, and ſo the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion is more difficult, then in the other caſe: and upon this ground, we ſee likely that the body of this ſociety, is more unhealthy then any other, becauſe the fulneſſe of bread choakes that heat, which ſhould concoct it; and their ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all bread which ſhould alter and convert the other into good nouriſhment, is made of that grain in the parable, which grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth among ſo many of thoſe thornes, as doe at the beſt, make the gathering of it, ſharp and uneaſie; for <hi>The ſolicitude of this</hi>

               <p>But many of thoſe Weedes which Courts are over-runne with, are ſlight levities, and vanities, that have but ſuch ſtings as nettles in them, which when they are held and handled rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſting leſſe, then when they are fingered tenderly: for there are diverſe fond affectations, which I need not inſtance, whereof, taking reſolutely in hand the reformation, we finde leſſe pain in diſcharging them, then we did apprehend, while we were but as it were chiding them, to fright them, rather then to put them away.

               <argument>
                  <p>Reall humility recommended, diſcerned from Court-ſhip, and proved conſonant to the ſtate of Courtiers.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THis admitted, the beſt preſcription can be given a Courtier againſt all his infirmities, is pious and diſcreet humility; and this is ſo farre from being alledged by themſelves, incompetent with their vocation, as almoſt every one pretends the being furniſhed with it, as a requiſite qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, though indeed moſt commonly, it is ſo hollow, as even the beſt noiſe it makes, ſpeakes the emptineſſe of it, as being but a tinkling cymball of ceremony and complement. There is a ſlight glittering ſtuffe, which commonly Courts are hung with, which paſſeth there for humility, and is truly but the tinſell of civility and courtſhip, through which, one may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſee the walls to conſiſt of pride and ſelfe-love: Wherefore they, who deſire the reall benefit of this virtue, muſt diſcerne between this ſuperficiall colouring, and the true being of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and endeavour an acquiring the habit thereof in their minde, not ſtudy the faſhion of it only in their exteriour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce.</p>
               <p>Me thinkes one may properly argue with Courtiers, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> did with the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> by repreſenting to them, how all <note place="margin">Ep. Heb.</note> the externall Ceremonies wherein they were ſo Religious, were types and figures of that reality which he propoſed to them, and ſo their cuſtomes and obſervances might well diſpoſe them, ſooner then the undiſciplined heathen, to acknowledge that bodie, whoſe ſhadow was ſo famillar to them: In like manner, may not I ſay to Courtiers, that all the civilities, Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and mutuall ſubmiſſions, whereof they are ſo ſtudious,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:115212:73"/>
are figures of that ſubſtantiall humility which I recommend to them; from whence I may argue that their habituall practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in theſe exteriour repreſentations of that virtue, ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance their mindes, more then other leſſe civilized converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, towards the acquiring of that reall humbleneſſe of ſpirit, I recommend to their intentions.</p>
               <p>Thoſe of whom it is commonly ſaid as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> that they are of the beſt ſect of their Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> they who are accompted the moſt accompliſhed in all urbanity and Courtſhip, and are the moſt exquiſite in all ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill poliſhments, in the purifications of their apparell and tables, and all other ſorts of humane neatneſſe and curioſity, they I ſay, muſt remember not to reſt ſo much on theſe <hi>tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men,</hi> as to forget the graver <hi>and weightier parts of the Law</hi> of Chriſtianity, which is purity of heart, and poverty of ſpirit, two of our King <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> his qualifications, for the <note place="margin">Matth. 5.</note> Courtiers of heaven required in the order of his beatitudes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>As for the other exteriour poliſhments and decencies, which are pertinent to their condition, I may ſay with our Saviour in the like caſe, <hi>theſe things may be done, but the other not omitted,</hi> for civility and ſincerity, proprety and purity, honour and humility, may be fellow Courtiers, and all of one party. So that I may ſay to theſe of the beſt ſort, <hi>Therefore ô men</hi>

                  <hi>you are inexcuſable, for you condemne your ſelves,</hi> by theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour profeſſions of thoſe virtues, if you have not the interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſignature and impreſſion of them, in ſo much, as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundicities of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> ſhall be more tollerable, <hi>viz.</hi> the ruder formes of life where humility and purity is not ſo much repreſented to them, ſhall not be ſo much charged with their defects in them, as this <hi>Capernaum</hi> where theſe virtues ſeeme preached every day, and wonders done in this Doctrine of ceremoniall purity, which is a figure of a reall immaculate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of minde.</p>
               <p>But I muſt ſpeak yet plainer, and declare that this humility I propoſe to Courtiers for their commerce with one another,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:115212:74"/>
is farre different from that currant ſpecies of a verball imagery of this vertue which I have decryed, for it is an internall habit, <note place="margin">Humility de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</note> or diſpoſition of humblenes impreſſed upon our ſpirits by the ſignature and character of truth, made by a lively exhibiting to our minds the intrinſique value of all ſpecious temporalities, by which perception we are diſpoſed to diſ-value really this world, and our ſelves in the firſt place; as knowing beſt our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior unworthineſſe: and this ſincere root of Humility, beares our ſeverall engagements, proportionated reſpectively: Firſt to the greatneſſe of God, then to the meanneſſe of our ſelves, and next, to our nearneſſe, and relation to our Brother. And as theſe three diviſions contain the totall ſumme of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſo is there no better Accountant to make up a juſt eſtimate of theſe diviſions, then Humility; whereof they who are ſolid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſſed, ſhall not be confounded in the diverſe fractions, and partitions of eſtimates either of things, or perſons, which their condition requires them to make, in the true account of this world; for they can eaſily by this Rule of Three, wherein Humility is perfect, divide all their reſpects to each of thoſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ſo give God, Themſelves, and their Brother reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively, their juſt eſtimations.</p>
               <p>Nor can it be anſwered that this degree of exactnes ſeemeth oppoſed, by the offices of this Vocation; for this cleare-ſight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Humility is ſo farre from being incompetent with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Courtiers, as if many circumſtances be fairely weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, their profeſſion may appeare more advantaged then any, towards this endowment; ſince likely they are the ſharpeſt, and moſt diſcerning Spirits, which apply themſelves to this active courſe of life; and ſurely this diſ-abuſing the object, is the moſt fairely, and moſt familiarly expoſed in Courts; <hi>viz.</hi> The fickle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and infidelity of all temporall advantages; ſince what the world calls Fortune, goes in other places more modeſtly atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and ſo may eaſily be miſtaken; whereas in Courts, preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming on her beauty, like a profeſſed Curtizan ſhe unveiles her ſelfe, confident of corrupting even thoſe to whom ſhe proclaims her diſloyaltie, by continual ſhows &amp; triumphs of inconſtancy.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:115212:74"/>
Many private and ſetled ſtates of Life, do take this knowledge of the inſtability of humane goods, but by heare-ſay, living themſelves in a calme dead water, where they feele little moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of variety; but Courtiers who are in this Ocean of Fortune, feele continually her tides, and very frequently her ſtormes; inſomuch as they living in a perpetuall fluctuation of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities, may be ſaid to walke <hi>Per ſpeciem,</hi> in the ſight of the true nature of all mundanities, and to ſee the variety of Fortune face to face, while low obſcurer lives, looke upon her perfidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe but through a glaſſe, and darkely in reports of the various turbulencies and confuſions of Courts.</p>
               <p>The heights of Courts may in this regard be ſaid to be the beſt ſcituations for proſpect, and farre ſight upon the truth of the worlds conſtitution, and ſo courtiers to be better placed then lower eſtates, in order to their being undeceived, in the ſpecious fallacies of the world, by as much as experience is more operative upon our nature then ſpeculation.</p>
               <p>And methinks we may account it a ſpeciall proviſion of God, that where our affections are in moſt danger to be ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, by the alluring invitation of temporalities, that there our reaſon ſhould be moſt powerfully diſſwaded from ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herencies, by the cleareſt evidences of the infidelity of ſuch confidences; for here Fortune beares her own name in her fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, which is viſible together with her ſmiles, and the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall objects of riſe and ruine, the frequent viciſſitudes of bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and bleeding conditions; ſhow Fortune in Courts (even but to indifferent good eyes) not as the <hi>Sirens</hi> of the <hi>Poets,</hi> the beauty and graciouſneſſe of her only above water, but expoſe her, juſt like to the <hi>Locuſts</hi> of the <hi>Revelation;</hi> for although on <note place="margin">Apoca. 9. 7.</note> her head <hi>there ſeemes to be crownes of gold, and her haire like the haire of Women, yet her teeth appeare as the teeth of Lyons, and her ſting like that of Scorpions;</hi> ſo that the deterrings and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abuſes appeare together with the delectations.</p>
               <p>I may therefore conclude, that Courtiers by their living in this demonſtration of the truth and nature of all mundanities, are advantaged above others, towards the acquiſition of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:115212:75"/>
which is, a naturall reſultancy, from a true apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the meanneſſe, and vility of all things ſo unfaithfull &amp; tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory: For as all Pride riſeth from the beliefe of ſome propriety which we rely on, ſo the perſwaſion of the inſecurity of our poſſeſſions, muſt needs abate our eſteem of them, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently diſpoſe us to a modeſt and humble account of our ſelves, and our conditions.</p>
               <p>I will therefore confidently commend Humility to Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for their guide, through all the ſnares of their way, in the tearmes of <hi>Solomon; She ſhall lead you by the paths of equity, which when you are in your ſteps ſhall not be ſtraitned, and when you</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pro. 4. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>run you ſhall not ſtumble;</hi> for you ſhall neither faint in the reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of your Fortune, nor fall in the full ſpeed of it; Humility doth not decline the courſe of Honour, and Dignity, but only caſts reines upon our ſenſitive appetite, and holds that from running away with our Reaſon, in the courſe. Nay, Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and Humility are conſortable in the ſame heart, wherein the habit of this vertue may conſiſt with acts of the other, ſince this diſpoſition diſlodgeth no vertue, and ſecureth all: For the poſture of proſtration in which Humility conducts our minds, may be ſaid to carry as it were a Trench before them, caſting up the earth it ſelfe for their defence, againſt all the fiery en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines of the Prince of this World, in regard the Penetration and inſpection which ſincere Humility makes into the bowels of our own earthineſſe and mortality, caſts up our miſery, and deſpicablenes before us, as a breſt-worke of our own earth, to defend our hearts againſt vain-glory or preſumption, by which any Fortune never ſo eminent can endanger us.</p>
               <p>For indeed, they who have this Parapet, as I may ſay, before their minds, of <hi>Duſt thou art, and to Duſt thou ſhalt returne,</hi> may be ſaid to be fortified in the nakednes and diſcovery of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: Such is the ingeniouſnes of Humility, as it can raiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences for us, out of our wants and deſtitutions; nay it may be ſaid to draw in them a Line of communication, between heaven and earth, joyning the knowledge of our own nullity, and the apprehenſion of the immenſity of God, which view may keep

               <argument>
                  <p>The vitiouſneſſe of Flattery diſplayed, with an allowance of decent civilities in exchanges of Courtſhip.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAving propoſed to Courtiers, for their chiefe ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſolid Humility, diſcerned from ſuperficiall civility, I muſt deſire them to be very ſincere in the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this vertue; for humanity and courteſie externall, do often ſo well counterfeit the ſtamp of it, as it had need be touched at ſome occaſion of ſuffering, to find the falſity of the metall: and for the greater ſafety of this vertue, it were to be deſired, we could baniſh and eliminate out of the verge, one of the beſt Waiters at Court, though of the worſt ſervants in it, namely, <hi>Flattery,</hi> which is alwayes an enemy to Humility, though it ſeeme often neare allyed unto it, by ſubmiſſive ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances: For we know, the firſt progenitor of Pride, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the primary father of Lyes, from which all Flattery deſcends in a collaterall Line. Hence it is, that there is alwayes ſome of the bloud of Pride, in all adulation, though it go cloathed in never ſo ſervile an habit of ſubmiſſion.</p>
               <p>And that we may ſee how naturally Flattery iſſueth out of Pride, wee may conſider into what a baſe and inferiour poſture <hi>Lucifer</hi> contrived himſelfe, when he caſt the firſt ſeeds of Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery into our earth; did he not lye proſtrate at thoſe feet he was undermining; while he was flattering them with their capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of treading on him, and becomming like Gods? And this ſeeming ſubjection, was it not deſigned by the ſublimeſt part of his Pride, which meant to captivate and ſubject the minds he wrought upon in this poſture?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:115212:76"/>
In like manner, all the ſervile formes of complacency, and deference to others, which Flattery caſts it ſelfe into, in the magnifying their worth and excellency, hath this ſerpentine inſinuation in it; to wit, the hoping to infuſe the eaſilyer the Flatterers ſenſe into them; which project in the complyers muſt needs riſe from a beliefe of their own minds, being ſo ſuperior to thoſe they are applyed to worke upon, as they can impoſe upon them the beliefe of all their ſuggeſtions, and ſo ſubdue their ſpirits; which thought is the very ſoule of Pride, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude our minds to have ſuch a tranſcendency over others; for no body flatters another, but in beliefe of being credited: So that all Flattery being anatomized will be found to live by the heart of Pride, which is indeed the firſt living part of Sico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantry, in what body ſoever of humble veriſimilitudes it ſeemes to move. And upon this ground we may ſay, that a meane Paraſite is a prouder thing, then the moſt magnifyed Prince he humoureth; in as much as the preſumption on the excellence of mind, as it is more ſpirituall, is nearer the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of Pride.</p>
               <p>And as it was excellently ſaid of a wiſe King, <hi>That witchcraft</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">King James.</note> 
                  <hi>is the height of Idolatry,</hi> becauſe though it exhibits no exterior offices of Worſhip, but rather diſclaimes them; yet is it the higheſt mentall veneration of the ſeducing ſpirit, and ſo the trueſt idolatry: In like manner it may be ſaid, that Flattery is the ſupremacy of Pride, becauſe though there be no externall profeſſion of ſelfe-love in it, but rather of an alienation from it, yet it is a continuall exerciſe of the ſupreameſt arrogancy, which is the Flatterers valuation of his own abilities.</p>
               <p>Whereupon it ſeemes that a <hi>Philoſopher</hi> being asked <hi>what was the moſt noxious beaſt to humane nature?</hi> anſwered, <hi>of wild beaſts a Tyrant, and of tame ones a Paraſite;</hi> and we may adde, that the tame ones ſeeme the worſt of the two, for the wild ones take the greateſt part of their ferocity, by coupling with them; ſince <hi>this commixion is the generation of all tyrannie, wild power en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying ſervile praiſe:</hi> Humane nature could not fall in love with the exorbitancy of wickedneſſe, if ſhe ſaw it naked, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:115212:76"/>
beheld the bare deformity of that object; therefore to make this conjunction, there muſt intercede the art of flattery, to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour the baſenes and inhumanity of outrageous miſchiefe, with ſome faire varniſh of decency; as either with the right of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or the liberties of nature, or many other ſuch ſhadowes, by which Sycophants keepe Tyrants minds the fiercer, by hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them in this darkenes, chained up by the magnifying and applauſe of their appetencies: ſo that this may be truly ſaid, in the tearmes of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> to be <hi>the peſtilence that walketh</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 90. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>in the darke,</hi> which the light of truth would eaſily aſſwage, ſomewhat, even in the greateſt rage of corrupted nature.</p>
               <p>We may therefore fitly ſay, that Flattery is the oyle of the <note place="margin">Flattery de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</note> ſinner, wherewith Tyrants are annointed by theſe Miniſters of their paſſions; and we know King <hi>David</hi> ſaith this ſhould not be the unction falling on the head of Princes: For this reaſon we cannot too ſtrongly brand the forehead of theſe Court <hi>Charlatans,</hi> ſince there is ſo much known art, to take out the markes of the character of a Paraſite, and to continue ſtill in the practiſe of this myſtery of iniquity.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe therefore it is hardly to be hoped, that this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of expulſion of Flattery out of Courts, can be ſtrictly executed; for when it is preſſed and ſtraitned by theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, then like the <hi>Poets Proteus,</hi> it varyes ſhapes, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares preſently covered with another forme, either in that of duty to ſuperiors, or civility to equals, or due commendation of merit, and will never anſwer to this indictment of Flattery: And indeed theſe formes, which ſhe ſhifts herſelfe eaſily into, are the legitimate iſſues of morality, by which all the fit alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances are made in civill ſociety; the two firſt bearing order and diſtinction beween Perſons, and the laſt producing fertility in vertue.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we cannot impeach this commerce of cuſtomary civility and complements, for there is a diſcipline belonging to the practicall part of morality, which is referred to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of the Miniſters of it, (which Courtiers may be moſt properly termed) and the rites and ceremonies of mutuall ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:115212:77"/>
are ornaments requiſite to raiſe reſpect, and ſorme or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in all the exerciſes of morality; therefore as it is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſet and regulate in ſuch ſort thoſe voluntary deſcants of complement, as to put them into ſuch meaſured notes, as they muſt preciſely runne in, to keepe them from ſtraying into Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, I will only ſet Courtiers this leſſon of the Apoſtle, which may keepe ſome time and meaſure in the conſort of their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call civilities, <hi>You are called unto liberty, only uſe not this liberty</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>I Do not in this ſharpe inſectation of ſordid Flattery, mean to aſperſe the good name of praiſes and commendations, for I muſt allow them to be convenient breſts, to nurſe young and tender diſpoſitions to vertue; and the good inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Princes and great perſons, may like their other iſſues be allowed more tender and dainty breeding then ordinary, and yet be nouriſhed with ſincere and healthfull aliments; for applauſe and eſtimation of all their young vertuous actions, and proffers, may be ſo tempered, as they may conduce to the thriving and growth of their minds, without any ſwelling or elation.</p>
               <p>Methinks praiſe may in ſome caſes be fitly applyed to our minds, as Corall is to the mouthes of children, when they are breeding teeth, which is given them to nibble and champ up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to eaſe and ſatisfy that little itch they have in their gums, in that ſeaſon, and to ſupple them ſo much as to bring their teeth out with the more eaſe: In this order praiſe may be aptly
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:115212:77"/>
given to young tender inclinations to vertue, for there is in our minds, in that ſtate, a ſpirituall itch which is eaſed and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, while they are champing, and ſucking upon applauſe, which doth alſo ſoften and open our imagination, and ſo leſſen the pain of our perverſe and froward nature, when the hardnes and ſharpenes of vertuous practiſes, which are ſpirituall teeth, do firſt breake the fleſh, which is alwaies done with ſome ſmart, when the tendernes of our ſenſes is pierced and broken through, firſt, by the ſharpnes of the ſpirit of vertue; &amp; by degrees, when our minds have thus put out theſe kinds of teeth more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly by theſe cheriſhing contributions, which help at firſt our weake nature, they advance to ſuch a ſtate of ſtrength, as to be able to feed on the ſolid meat of vertue, which is the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of our duty to God and man, irreſpectively to humane praiſe, and by theſe ſteps we come to be wean'd from the emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of ſenſible applauſe, which is the firſt milke our imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are foſtered with, and gives them a ſweet reliſh of vertue.</p>
               <p>Since then we find by experience how praiſe and eſtimation conduce much to the ſweetning of the aſperity of vertue in young taſts, I do not diſcredit the miniſtring of ſober and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt praiſes, to the good diſpoſitions of great and eminent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whoſe minds are too commonly at Court in this tender ſtate of growth and proſiciency; and I confeſſe it is not practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, to frame rules for the diſcernment, between due praiſes, and flatteries, in all occurrences in the worlds commerces.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the ingenuity of every particular, muſt be every ones director in this point; but the beſt generall advice I can conceive, is, for thoſe who are paſſive in commendations, to weigh the worthineſſe of the hand that layes them on, in one of the Scales, againſt the beliefe, they put into the other, of their own deſerts; and ſtill to put in ſomewhat leſſe credit of their own praiſes, then the opinion of the praiſer layes in the ſcale; and thoſe who are active in this ſubject, when they praiſe any they love<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and would perfume them with the good odour of vertue, muſt remember to give them leſſe of this ſweet oyle, then their own opinion; and beliefs would caſt upon them;
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:115212:78"/>
which is to ſay, that when we are praiſing our friends to their face, we ſhould be carefull to praiſe them alwayes ſomewhat leſſe then we love them; for likely that meaſure of our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons filled with praiſes, will runne over, if it be poured into that of our friends merit, and when we are upon the receipt of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations from kind conferrers of them, we muſt be adviſed in taking ſomewhat leſſe of them upon the account of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, then is offered us; for we may give alwayes a good allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of diſcrediting, for the partiality of friendſhip, which cannot be exact in the weighing of her opinions.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Chimicks</hi> ſay, that he who had found the art to fix <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> might eaſily transforme it into gold; ſo may I ſay, If there were meanes to limit this volatil matter of complement, and fluency of praiſes, within the termes of that preciſe good, which is beleeved of one another; this might convert all currant civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, into the gold of charity, and then the breath of reciprocall praiſes might mutually kindle vertue, rayſing but little ſmoake of vanity.</p>
               <p>But this rectitude of our lips is not to be hoped in this our ſtate of crookedneſſe of hearts; for our words are caſt off from their moulds; and ſince it was flattery that drew the mouth awry of that figure whereof we are all copies, our mouthes wil alwayes ſtand ſomewhat drawne aſide from the ſtraitnes of truth, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſide of flattery, eſpecially when we find the eares of great perſons drawn awry into that poſture.</p>
               <p>Foraſmuch then as we cannot pretend to rectify perfectly this ſhape of our diſtorted nature, we muſt be cautious to leane as little as we can to that ſide of our inclination to flattery: King <hi>David</hi> found this deflection, &amp; indirectnes in our minds, when he proclaimed, that <hi>verities are diminiſhed from the ſonnes of men, they ſpeake vanity every one with his neighbour, with flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering lips, and a double heart;</hi> ſince through our beſt watches over our lips, there will eſcape many exceſſes in the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes of civilities; it is very requiſite for the ſafety of their hearts, that Courtiers ſhould not let their tongues runne looſe in the ordinary excurſions of complements, thinking ſuch
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:115212:78"/>
words weigh as little as the breath that carries them, for we know that even all thoſe nulls and ciphers, in our reckoning, are ſet upon account to us.</p>
               <p>I wil therefore cloſe up this caution, with that terrible animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Goſpell, <hi>By thy words thou ſhalt be juſtifyed, and</hi>

And did not Saint <hi>Maurice</hi> in the head of the Emperours Army, erect ſuch a trophie for Chriſtianity, as all Times triumph in? for in deſiance of thoſe Spirits which called themſelves a Legiou, he flouriſhed the Colours of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> dyed in the bloud of a whole Legion of Martyrs; which bleſſed legion of Spirits did ſo poſſeſſe the Chriſtians of thoſe times, by their, examples, that many gave ſupernaturall teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies <note place="margin">Mar. 5.</note> of this holy poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>And may it not be remarked for the honour of Courts, that while Chriſtianity was but ſhed and ſprinkled here and there, in the lower parts of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> it was carryed but in the hands of <hi>Chriſts Commiſsioners?</hi> but when <hi>Chriſt</hi> was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to appeare at Court, he marked his lodging with his own ſignet, the glorious Croſſe; firſt in the ayre, viſible to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and to the whole Court, and after, the ſame <note place="margin">Euſeb. vit. Conſtant.</note> night appeared himſelfe to the Emperour, adviſing him how to manifeſt his glory, which untill then, he was content ſhould not break out of the clouds of contempt &amp; perſecution, that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt it. And thus Chriſt made his remove preſently from the Grots and Cavernes of the fields, up to the imperial palace of <hi>Rome,</hi> where he ſet up his Croſſe triumphant over that Crown, which til then, went as near burying of it, as the keeping it long under ground, for the Caverns of the fields were before that time, both the Tombes and Pallaces of the Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>And it may be noted, that when Chriſtianity deſcended from this heigth of the Court, upon the lower parts of the Empire, it ſpread it ſelfe faſter in a few yeares, then it had done in the three hundred, before it camp up to the Court, for till then, the waters of Life were caſt upward, and forced againſt the riſings of ſenſe, humane power, and naturall reaſon, by the ſupreame force of Miracles, and ſo were ſpread no further, then they carried them by continuall renewed ſupplies of miraculous o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations;
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:115212:80"/>
but now after there broke out this Spring of Living water, on the tops of the mountaines of the Empire, it ranne down more naturally, and plentifully upon the ſubjacent parts, and fructifyed the earth faſter, and more univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>In our corrupted nature, what is the common effect of mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall, holds alſo in ſpirituall weight falling on our mindes, for the higher reaſon falls from the elevation of authority, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the more impreſſion and penetration it makes upon them: wherefore Chriſtian Religion, when it fell from the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preameſt point of humane power, the Imperiall Court made much more ſenſible markes upon the world, then it had done before. And as this operative efficacy, may endeare to Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers their vocations, ſo muſt it needs preſſe ſo much the more upon them the evidence of their vertues.</p>
               <p>Thus I have ſhowed how the Court may ſay, in honour of her converſion, that <hi>Chriſt in diverſe manners ſpoke to the other parts of the world</hi> by his Meſſengers, but unto us he ſpake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <note place="margin">Heb. 4.</note> when he came firſt to Court in publicke, for before <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantines</hi> time was there but as we ſay in <hi>incognito,</hi> but then he appeared in his own place, over the head of Kings, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſlodged the Prince of darkenes out of theſe roomes of State, whereas before he had but diſplayed him in his under Offices, while he did but deliver and free private poſſeſſions, but then in one act he ſeemed to diſpoſſeſſe the whole Roman Empire, when he expelled him from the Court.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Some notorious errors remarked, &amp; what facility the breeding of Courtiers may bring towards an excellence in religious duties, proved by examples.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>COurtiers (who may by theſe reflexions be apt to value their vocation) muſt be put in mind, that as they are more eminently then any, <hi>made ſpectacles to the world, to Angels, and to men,</hi> they have in that preheminence a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.</note> charge upon them, of being more to the life the image of the celeſtiall man; in which figure, there is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at Court one remarkeable incongruity, which is, that the feet are more laboured, and better finiſhed then the head; for morall vertues hold but an analogy with theſe parts in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of chriſtianity, ſince they are but as it were carriages for theologicall or divine vertue to reſt, and move upon.</p>
               <p>The errour then which I reproach, is, that there are many who are very preciſe in acquiring, and preſerving their reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in courage, prudence, and fidelity, and are as remiſſe and indifferent in their applications to charity, piety, and humility; which is methinks ſuch an incongruity in chriſtianity, as that of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> was in the Law, when they ſaid, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall ſweare by the Temple, it is nothing, but he that ſweares by the Gold of the Temple, is a debtor,</hi> making no account of that which was truly a ſacred obligation, and making a great ſcruple in what was nothing ſo obligatory. And do not thoſe who are ſo pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall in their reputation, concerning all morall accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſo unconcerred in the opinion of their chriſtian per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, ſeem to practiſe the ſame impertinency? For all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality is in relation to chriſtianity, but what the gold was to the Temple; ſince it is only ſanctifyed by being ſerviceable, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſteriall to Religion; wherefore they who pretend exactnes in all civill and ſociable honeſties, unleſſe it be in order to divine duties, and obligations, may be doubted to be more Diſciples of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> then of JESUS, more affecters of the praiſes of men, then advocates for the part of vertue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:115212:81"/>
But this information againſt this Soleciſme in the ſtile of many Courtiers virtues, doth not diſcredit the vocation (though I need not fear much the taking away the good name of it in the world,) for this diſcipline in morality, and faſhion of punctuality in civill dutyes, (if the principle thereof be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere in the love of Moral virtue) may work, and accomodate the mind to a generall habit of ſincerity, which when it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to religious uſes, proves a facilitation towards fidelity and perſeverance in them; as <hi>Saint Paul</hi> his <hi>Phariſaicall</hi> ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſeverity was a great promotion of the true religious fervor of his <hi>Apoſtleſhip;</hi> So this naturall preparation in Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers in theſe points of courage, loyalty, and civility, raiſeth the flame of their devotion the higher, when thoſe ſo well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed materials are kindled by the <hi>Prophets Seraphim,</hi> or by the <hi>Apoſtles fiery tongues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The pregnancy of many Courtiers in ſanctity, ingrafted upon the ſtock of naturall good parts, and acquired virtues, alloweth us to ſay as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaid of Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> (who grew by nature in the higheſt part of the world, and was ſingularly endued with all humane literature before his converſion,) how well over-laid with the gold of <hi>Egypt,</hi> did <hi>Cyprian</hi> come out of it, with which he enriched <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> And ſo the Church may truly acknowledge that many Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers have brought out with them much of this precious met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall of humane prudence and ſagacity, by which virtuous qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and honeſtations they have been more happy then others in their applications to move the mindes of men, in whoſe tempers they had been ſo well verſed, this ingenious and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatill habit of mind, (which they had acquired in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of the world) hath made their ſpirituall practice upon the world, much more ſucceſſefull then that of others, whoſe ſepulative piety is leſſe accommodable with the humours of the patient; and certainly they owe much of theſe furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances and inablements to the civill Diſcipline and Politique literature of Courts.</p>
               <p>I ſtill conclude therefore in defence of the vocation of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:115212:81"/>
courtiers, while I reproach to them the perverſion of their advantagees in education, for ſince nature is the ground on which grace is planted, the temper of the ground conduceth much to the increaſe, may be expected; for without doubt the civill breeding of <hi>Moſes</hi> did much contribute to all his naturall excellencies, and the being the moſt reverend and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected perſon of the Court, did not at all elate his heart, the ſoftneſſe of his education was rather a good previous diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition for the effect of the Supernaturall Agent, in point of the admirable me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <argument>
                  <p>Compariſons between vocations diſavowed, and advices offered, in order to a due correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the grace of a Courtiers profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BY what I have pleaded in this laſt argument, I do not pretend to prefer the porch of <hi>Solomon</hi> before the <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary,</hi> I intend to keep the due diſtances in my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures between ſacred and ſecular vocations; each of them ſtand in their proper order, and conſtitute the grace and decency of the <hi>Temple</hi> which King <hi>David</hi> did love ſo much; For as the <hi>Father</hi> hath many manſions in his houſe, ſo the <hi>Sonne</hi> hath ſeverall offices in his, ſorted to thoſe diſtinctions; and the <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt</hi> marſhals and ranks all thoſe diverſities of callings in ſuch ſort, as to frame an harmonious conſonancy between both Houſes, of the <hi>Church militant</hi> and <hi>triumphant,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> informeth us, that <hi>There are diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of gifts, and differencies of adminiſtrations made by the ſame Spirit, who divideth to every one ſeverally as he will.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore my purpoſe is not to meaſure or weigh the preferableneſſe of ſeverall vocations, but onely to ſet that of Courtiers rectified and ſtraight in the underſtanding of the world, to the end that not onely the conſiſtence of this calling with piety, may be evidenced againſt the popular traduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but that alſo the advantages of this vocation being rightly ballanced with the prejudices, may confute courtiers themſelves in this error, of ſuppoſing they may diſcharge part of their infidelity to God, upon the infelicity of their vocation in order to Piety.</p>
               <p>Every ſtate of life hath an aſſignment of grace commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurate to the neceſſities of that calling; all things are diſpoſed
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:115212:83"/>
in <hi>number, weight, and meaſure,</hi> as the <hi>Wiſe man</hi> informeth us; <note place="margin">Sap. 11. 12.</note> ſo that although the temptations be more in number and weight, then in more retired and in glorious courſes, yet the abilities and underſtandings of the perſons are commonly ſtronger then in vulgar ſtations, whereby they are better ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to apprehend their dangerous expoſures, and accept them from the divine order, as a Rent charge of perill, laid upon the plenty of their temporall eſtates; by which diſcernment, they may convert even the ſpecies of their ſeducements into the treaſure of patience and humility, deriving from the perilous part of their condition, concluſions againſt the worth of things never ſo glorious, being but tranſitory; ſince by theſe fruitions greater and eternall glory is ſo much endangered.</p>
               <p>And by this reflexion, even all thoſe fiery darts which fly about the Court, headed with the wilde fire of the Prince of darkneſſe, (though they have a fabulous ſirname which the Poets have invented to diſguiſe them, to wit, <hi>the golden ſhafts of Cupid,</hi> quite contrary to this their due aſcription,) when they light upon this ſhield of faith, and expectance of eternall joy and glory, are eaſily extinguiſhed: So that a good humble courtier marching as I have directed him in all his wayes, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the foundation of humility, and poverty of ſpirit, may keep a ſafe courſe in all the higheſt ſtoryes of fortune, and be no more ſcorched with pride or vanity, then with fire-works playing in the ayre; and though the Prince of that Region en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaineth all Courts much with ſuch flaſhie ſhewes, (that is, with the glittering vanities, and reſplendencies of the world,) yet to an humble and diſcerning ſoul, they will ſeem no more then ſquibs breaking into ſparkling ſhivers of fire, which ſhine but for a moment, and die with the ill ſcent of thoſe rags whereof they are compoſed.</p>
               <p>Upon all theſe conſiderations, it ſeemeth to me to import all the ſucceſſe of this courſe of life, the fixing in our mind this principle, that all humane life, eſpecially the active part is conſtituted in a ſtate of continuall malitancy, in which noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on courtiers ſhould account themſelves as the chief officers of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:115212:83"/>
the field, and ſo remember that the condition of being in the head of the world, is like that of being in the head of troopes, ſince it coupleth alwayes danger equall to the degrees of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. And upon this ſuppoſition, they ought to be induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in providing extraordinary armour, in which point if they will be but as provident as they uſe to be for the defence of that life, they can but defer, and not truly defend or ſave, they are in a ſtate no way diſadvantaged for that Coronation, promiſed onely upon the condition of victory; ſince to the greateſt vanquiſhers are propoſed the largeſt Crowns. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they who are frighted like <hi>Eliſha's</hi> ſervant, with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſure of tempations, let them look upward with the <note place="margin">Kin. 4. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> to the mountaines, and they ſhall ſee the fiery Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>holy Spirit</hi> ſtanding for their defence, inſomuch as they may truly ſay, there are more with us then againſt us; for Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> gives them this aſſurance, He that is in you, is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then he who is in the world.</p>
               <p>By theſe defences I hope to ſilence the popular cry againſt Courts in <hi>exeat aulâ qui vult eſſe Pius,</hi> as if a good Chriſtian and a good courtier were not ſtars of the ſame hemiſphere, and ſo could not be ſeen together. For there are ſome natures, as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith, ſo ſhady, as to think every thing turbulent and ſtormy, that is but in broad day-light; and we may ſitly ſay of the eyes of ſuch minds, that they have not yet had the laſt touch of chriſtianity; for like the man in the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Chriſt</hi> his laſt touch, ſaw men but obſcurely looking like trees, theſe minds may be ſaid to have a ſpirituall dimneſs upon them that doth not ſee clear, nor far enough into the grace of different conditions; this touch of <hi>Pauls</hi> hand when it ſeemes he was doing the ſame cure upon the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> may eluci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date further this caſe unto them; thoſe who are not <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Cor. 12.</note> nor <hi>Prophets,</hi> have their ranks allotted, and due proviſions of graces deſigned to their ſeverall ſtations.</p>
               <p>And likewiſe by theſe adviſes, I hope to rectifie that ſo different error in many minds, which claime the ſlipperineſſe of their ſtation, for a tolleration of many foule falls, aledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:115212:85"/>
advertiſed of the malignity thereof, ſince the matter lyes ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in their way.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle Saint <hi>James,</hi> as Gods advocate, brings a hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous charge againſt this libertinage, which in the world doth <note place="margin">Jam. 4. 11.</note> pretend to paſſe, at the higheſt, for no more then a treſpaſſe, not a ſin; but thus he informeth againſt it; <hi>Detract not from one another; he that detracteth from his brother, or he that judgeth his brother, detracteth from the Law, and judgeth the Law;</hi> ſo that not onely the credit of man, but even the honour of God ſeemeth violated by theſe invaſions, ſince even the law of God is ſaid to be impleaded by ſuch aſperſions; God ſeemeth to have tender'd ſo much the good fame of man, as he hath joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his own honour with it, as a convoy againſt the inſults of our vitious fancyes, that we might at leaſt reſpect Gods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment in the violation of the fame of one another; detracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is thus proved to be one of the greateſt offenders in humane ſociety, yet the familiarity covereth ſo much the faultineſſe, as it ſuffereth the ſeldomeſt of any criminall, by reaſon of the many diſguiſes it can interchange: inſomuch as ſometimes religious juſtice that would not connive, knoweth not how to take notice of it, meeting it ſo ingeniouſly transformed, but for the moſt part it is not ſtrictly looked after.</p>
               <p>The caſe of mediſance in courts, is like that of looſe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the world that are very handſome, who do oftener gain and corrupt the officers of juſtice, then they are detected and indicted by them; for abuſes and deriſions of one another, paſſe for ſuch a kind of <hi>Pecadill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:115212:86"/>
unhappy facundity, that our earth needs no rain to fall upon it, that is, no externall provocation to fertilize it, there riſeth a miſt out of it ſelfe that watereth it, to wit, our innate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, which cauſeth this pregnancy of thorns and briars, that prick and ſcratch one another in a reciprocall and cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary detraction, wherein we differ much from the opinion of the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> for we conceive we gather the beſt figs from theſe thorns, and the beſt grapes from theſe brambles, that is, we raiſe the moſt pleaſant points of our diſcourſe, and the moſt chearful rejoycings of our hearts out of theſe pungencies and ſtingings of one another.</p>
               <p>Of all the diſguiſes mediſance puts on, that of mirth is the moſt common, and the moſt cunning; for there it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in ſo naturall a habit, weareth the clothes of innocence and harmleſneſſe ſo handſomely, and ſpeaketh the language ſo well, as ſeldome any inquire whether it be a native of that ſtate; but as ſtrangers are eaſilier diſcovered by their accents then by the improperneſſe of their words; So mediſance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth moſt commonly ſome forreign accent, if it be well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that betrayeth it to be no native of the ſtate of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence; yet we are likely over-civill, in taking notice of this forreigner, and very familiarly uſe detraction, as we do ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers we would oblige, when we flatter their failings in our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage by the warrant of civility, and take no notice of what we cannot chuſe but perceive; This kind of court-ſhip is much uſed in our entertainment of all ingenious and well faſhioned mordancy or detraction.</p>
               <p>In this particular more then in any other, we commonly at Court obſerve the precept of <hi>doing to others, as we would be done to our ſelves;</hi> For we examine one anothers faults in this kind, rather as complices then judges, ſo generall is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence towards the maintenance of this common intereſt of our fancyes entertainment: For alas, how few are there in Courts that are not either theevs or receivers in this ſtealth of one anothers good name? for thoſe who have not tongues to commit the fact, have eares to entertaine it, and it may be
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:115212:86"/>
truly ſaid in this caſe, that if there were no ſuch receivers, there would be no ſuch theeves, ſince the good reception and welcome that witty mediſance finds, doth ſurely entertain the profeſſion; and alas how few reſolve with the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> that <note place="margin">Pſal. 140.</note> this <hi>oyle of ſinners ſhall not make fat their head,</hi> but do rather uſe it to keep their faces ſmooth, and ſhining in ſmiles &amp; gaye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes; little remembring what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of whiſperers and detracters, that <hi>not onely they that do ſuch things, are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of death, but they alſo that have pleaſure in thoſe that do</hi>

                  <hi>them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ought we not to be the more vigilant in the diſcernment and diſcountenancing this licentiouſneſſe, when we conſider how hardly this offence can come to be ſentenced, ſince the committers of it are very often the onely poſſible Judges of the crime? ſo well is it diſſembled to the reſt of the company; which even when they do ſuſpect it is rendred very partial, by being interreſted in the pleaſure, and not conceiving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves concerned in the fault; wherefore every one muſt be his own ſincere overſeer and cenſor of the edition of his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage on this Theame, ſince he is not likely to meet any other correction; All other licentiouſneſſe of ſpeech doth likely meet with ſome adverſe party in the company, and ſo cometh not off without being ſhot at with ſome reprehenſion, but plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and ſharp mediſance, as if it were in contribution with all humours, paſſeth commonly freely in all converſations, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſo much as the warning of an enemy.</p>
               <p>Our own conſciences muſt therefore be the conductors of our fancyes, when they are licenſed to go out in partyes <hi>a la petite guerre,</hi> as the French cals it, to a kind of little warre in converſation; and the French have ſuted methinks this kind of liberty of ſpeech very aptly with a terme, calling it <hi>faire la guerre,</hi> as it were ſhirmiſhing of wits with one another: and I conceive that mediſance may be very properly matched in this particular, with the cuſtome that parties have in the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes they make upon high-wayes, in their own quarters; for when they take from travellers in the tearms of civill asking,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:115212:87"/>
becauſe the words are not violent, they maintaine the action to be lawfull; whereby many times when in effect they do rob, they perceive not their own theft; after fuch a ſort mediſance or detraction while it uſeth the tearmes of <hi>raillerie,</hi> that is, quaint &amp; handſome jeſting, although it take away what repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation it pleaſeth, yet the actors deceive themſelves in the crime by the civill and ſociable forme whereinto it is contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>The inſinuation therefore of this miſchievous quality into mirth, ought to be watched with the more attention, ſince the preception of it is often very difficult, &amp; the prejudice alwaies very deſperate; for it worketh it ſelfe into converſation, (which is the beſt externall fruit our reaſon beareth) like a worm by a little orifice, but it tainteth and corrupteth more then the birds, which prey directly upon the skin of the fruit, that is, then more profeſſed indecencies and preſumptions, which are like birds eaſier ſeen and driven away, by an apparent gravity and ſobriety ſet up in our behaviour.</p>
               <p>It importeth us very much to preſerve converſation (which ſeemeth the intellectuall aire, that our ſoules breath in and out) as pure and wholſome as we can, ſince though the infection of it, do not ſenſibly offend us at the inſtant, yet it worketh upon our minds by a more ſubtil infuſion of malignity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it corrupts by degrees the habit and diſpoſition of our ſoules; wherefore the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> tells us, that <hi>with the perverſe, we ſhall be perverted;</hi> and how often do we find this ſurreptious contagion crept into our hearts, without much ſence of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducement? of which caſe <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>The words of the whiſperer are as it were ſimple, and the ſame come to the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>

                  <p>Some Rules whereby to ſquare our diſcourſe, and an expedient offered towards the correction of Mediſance.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BY this reformation propoſed, I do not intend any defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the faire and pleaſant frontiſpiece of ſociable converſation, for I do not deſign the breaking down of all diſcourſe, that hath the image or aſpect of civill hoſtility, that is, all ingenious wraſtling and fencing of wits againſt one another; ſuch formes of ſpeech may be handſomely ſet, as ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Figures and carvings upon the ſtructure of converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which may innocently grace and imbelliſh the whole frame, there are many paſſages that have an evident character of harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe mirth and jollity; which although they are piquant, yet are not eaſily pervertible to any diſparagement of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; ſo that our ſpeech may be with grace, and ſeaſoned with ſalt, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> adviſeth us, wherefore in any ſuch recreative freedoms may well be admitted, with this caution given to the utterers, that they examine not only the candor of their owne thoughts, but likewiſe the compoſition of the perſons whom ſuch liberties may concerne, as alſo the humours of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany where they are vented, for I conceive, theſe three circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ought to concur, for the licenſing ſuch exerciſes of our <note place="margin">What cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in jeſting.</note> fancy; firſt, the ingenuous and harmleſſe intention of them that miniſter the mirth, next the probability of a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding by them who are the ſubject of it, and laſtly, the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood of an innocent apprehenſion of our jeſts in the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny they are addreſſed unto, for their pleaſure and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and I conceive one may be very good company, reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their wits within theſe three religious limitations, for while our words are tuned to the Key of charity, Men and Angels

               <p>Conſidering the humour of the world, and how faſhions are ſooner decryed, by the diſlike of ſuch perſons, as they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to fancy, then by the prohibitions or order of the ſtate, I conceive the beſt proportioned expedient, to the effect of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing this licentious cuſtome of pillaging one anothers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, in theſe excurſions of jeſt and raillery, is to terrify the receivers of ſuch ſpoyles, which are thoſe, that take them off from the acting parties with applauſe and delectation; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch patrons muſt be advertiſed, that they know not how deare they pay for ſuch preyes, when they imagine they give nothing but a cheerefull countenance for them, ſince indeed they coſt them more innocence, then many of them would part with for them, if that price was directly ſet upon them: let them be admoniſhed then, that as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitters of ſuch facts, that <hi>the poyſon of Aſpes is under their lips,</hi> ſo that it may be properly ſaid of the receivers of ſuch thefts, in the tearmes of the Holy Spirit, <hi>They ſuck the head of Aſpes, &amp; the Vipers tongue ſhal kil them:</hi> Since we are made by God as it were mutual Feoffees in truſt for one anothers good name, by this order, which declareth that <hi>God hath given every one</hi>

               <p>Let not then thoſe parties unto whoſe complacency ſuch licentiouſnes is addreſſed, ſuppoſe that they may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocently injoy ſuch ſpoyles, which they pretend not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeake, but only to accept as a preſent from their familiars; for ſurely all perſons of alluring fortunes, or of other followed qualities, which are noted for entertainers and cheriſhers of Mediſance and bitterneſſe in converſation, do no better then ſet up a Shop declaredly to take off plundered goods; which
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:115212:88"/>
commodity offered to the violaters, cannot chuſe but paſſe for a contribution to the Fact; and the miſchiefe of this traffique is alwayes proportioned, by the eminency of the eſtate of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that profeſſeth this commerce; for high encouragements do as it were preſſe theſe morall plunderers, which are ſuch li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious companies, that thoſe who raiſe them ſo eaſily, as they coſt them but their connivance, cannot caſhiere them again with their command, for very often as the <hi>Wiſeman</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers themſelves are ſtung</hi> with the Serpents they play with, and then <hi>who ſhall pity them, when they ſwell upon ſuch ſtingings?</hi>

               <p>Let every one then make this good uſe of the reſpect and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference which is given to their perſons or conditions; the taking upon them to diſcredit this ſo pernitious faſhion of receiving (as juſtifyable Preſents from their obſervers) the deſamation of their brother; for when this humour of Mediſance ſpringeth in the head of the company, it runnes fluently into the leſſe noble parts; but when it riſeth firſt but in the inferior and dependent perſons, it requireth a force of wit and ingenioſity to raiſe and diffuſe it upward, which capacity is not very familiar: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I conceive the moſt powerful receipt againſt this miſchiefe to be the poſſeſſing the moſt eminent and reverenced perſons of Courts, with the irreligiouſneſſe of this authoriſed faſhion of Mediſance, cheriſhed under the diſguiſe of mirth: For if Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces do ignoble their minds, with this favouring of detraction, they do not only licenſe it, but ſeem even to impoſe it, which is ſuch a kind of grievance, as offendeth much, and yet leſſeneth their owne meanes, not only in point of their re-obliging, but likewiſe in their part of commanding, for what is taken from the true value and eſtimation of every one, by this liberty, is loſt to the Prince in all the uſes he hath of their ſervice; ſo that Princes have not only a religious, but a politique duty, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of them ſeverity rather then indulgence towards this toleration, ſince their ſimple connivance will introduce detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, in the faſhion called <hi>incognito,</hi> which alloweth all the ſame liberties, to the party ſo received, under this colour of his not profeſſing himſelfe to be preſent in his own quality; ſuch a

kind of admiſſion doth the connivance of Princes give to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſance, treating with her, as if they tooke no notice of her qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: and when Princes foule their hands actively in this ſully<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of others, they do as it were publiquely preſcribe the fame and reputation of every one, and ſeeme to ſet a price upon them, for every one that can bring them into their delight and entertainment; nor is this price limited, but may be ſaid to be as much as every accure malicious wit ſhall rate his hope at, by becoming agreeable and familiar with the Prince.</p>

                  <p>Of the dangerouſneſſe of theſe libertyes, and the familiar excuſes made for them.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BEing in chaſe of the tongue, which Saint <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>is ſo wilde a beaſt as no body can tame,</hi> me thinks <note place="margin">James 3.</note> this other unruly evill ſeemeth to be her other fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leg, whereby ſhe runnes ſo lightly in the courſe of our nature, and ſets it (as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith) on fire; wherefore theſe her two vitiouſneſſes of mediſance and lubricity may well be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted together, and in effect they are ſeldome parted in our humours. Moreover, as they are twins of an illegitimate and ſcandalous conception, their delivery is commonly after ſuch a manner, as that of <hi>Pharez</hi> and <hi>Zara,</hi> where he that put his <note place="margin">Gen. 38.</note> hand firſt into the world, came intyrely the laſt into it: So detraction and piquantnes of wit, doth likely firſt make prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to iſſue out of our corrupted nature, but is fully delivered the latter of the two, for we know that our fancies even in their immature ſeaſon, ſtrain to be forward in this point of mediſance and mordancy of one another, but the other twin, namely looſneſſe and uncleanneſſe of ſpeech, entreth firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly into our diſcourſe, by reaſon that the full growth of mediſance, requireth a riper fancy, and many extimulations to ſharpen it; whereof our green youth is not ſuſceptible:
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:115212:90"/>
ſo that moſt commonly our tongue delivereth fully this vice of foulenſſe and obſcenity of ſpeech the firſt into the world; and thus, that of the two which in part ſallieth firſt out of our fancy, is the laſt in point of an intire production, I ſhall not ſtay to examine their priority, in this relation of their brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in iniquity, as neither of them are children of light, ſo their inheritance is ſuch, as even the leaſt ſhare will ſeeme too much to each of them; wherefore I may truly ſay, <hi>Bleſſed are they who daſh theſe while they are little ones, againſt the ſtones</hi> of the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt, repreſſing the firſt ſtrainings and proffers of our fancies, at theſe indecent excurſions.</p>
               <p>But alas how diſtancial are we from this igennious coercion of our polluted fancies? When commonly we ſet al our wits upon this liberty, to cloake and palliate it, when it is accuſed; do we not familiarly ſeeke to elude the reprehenſions, and to cover this our Idol of Wantonneſſe with <hi>Rachels</hi> Mantle, anſwering <note place="margin">Gen. 31.</note> our impeachers, <hi>it is with us after the manner of the world?</hi> the cuſtomary infirmity of our nature is made the palliation of this iniquity; but ſurely cuſtome and poſſeſſion in this caſe ought ſtrongly to be impleaded; for if cuſtome paſſe for a ſecond na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, even when at firſt it contendeth againſt her, when it doth concurre and ſecond her; how ſtrong and unruly muſt they needs both grow againſt the order and diſcipline of grace? which is evidenced in moſt companies by the notorious exceſſes of theſe impunities.</p>
               <p>But it is no hard Argument to overthrow this plea of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, and to prove this charge of a high offence againſt this licentiouſnes of ſpeech, becauſe if we ſtand charged with al our words upon accompt, all our indecent and uncleane ones muſt needs be ſet very high in the reckoning; by reaſon they may be ſaid to be reſponſable, not only for all the time we our ſelves take up upon them, but even for all the loſſe and prejudice the company ſuffereth by them, ſince whether they offend or affect the company, we are anſwerable for both theſe effects, for the ſcandall even when they are diſtaſted, and much more for the temptation when they are well reliſhed; and if we are injoyned
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:115212:91"/>
ſuch a preferring the good of ſociety, before that of ſinglenes, as we are diſſwaded by the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> even lawfull and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent libertyes, in caſe of indangering the ſcandalizing of our brother; how faulty muſt be this unruly tranſgreſſion of all the precepts that directly prohibit ſuch licentiouſneſſe? Is it not a pleaſant anſwer to Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> order, of <hi>let no ill word come out of your mouth,</hi> to reply, <hi>alas we are uſed to let out ſo</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>many as the cuſtome may ſtand for our defence:</hi> to which, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks we may ſuppoſe the ſpirit of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> anſwering as he did upon the occaſion of reforming an effeminate faſhion among the <hi>Corinthians, We have no ſuch cuſtome, nor the Church of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The moſt familiar extenuation of this culpable practiſe, is, that there are many light paſſages in diſcourſe, that have no aime but the preſent jollity and recreation, and that many of ſuch levities ſpring up in our way without the ranging of our fancyes for any ſuch game, and that ſuch accidentall free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes may produce a harmeleſſe recreation; I do not bring my charge againſt any ſuch chances, there may many words be ſtarted in converſation that may move our firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincts to runne after ſuch ſportings, wherefore I do not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taint all ſuch propenſions, but deſire that this aptneſſe in our nature may be rightly underſtood, and that we may diſcerne our being moved with ſuch light invitations, to be rather excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable by our frailties, then juſtifiable by the qualities of ſuch mirth.</p>
               <p>There is no fault ſo little in this kind, that is not accounted one; for the familiarity of theſe ſmall imperfections, indange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth their riſing into higher corruptions; how many little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſes do we ſee, that being wiped off as ſoon as they light upon our clothes, come out again with any ſtain? which if they be neglected, ſinke in, and leave their ſpots upon the place: nor is there any morall immundicity of a more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous inſinuation then this of wanton diſcours, by reaſon it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduceth it ſelf in a harmeles apparence, &amp; ſo ſubtilly, as even many who aime at purity of life, are ſometimes if not affected,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:115212:91"/>
at leaſt amuſed &amp; diverted by it in their deſign, and unto ſuch wel diſpoſed minds do I addres this animadverſion; to ſuch I ſay, in whoſe lives theſe amuſements are the moſt apparent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; for in ſuch ſubjects, (in whom theſe exceſſes are, the leaſt of their corruptions, where out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth overfloweth in theſe pollutions) I cannot hope to waſh off ſo eaſily this ſoule graine of their interior diſpoſition; this particular being ſo twiſted &amp; inwrapped in other groſſer vices (like ſtrawes or fethers cleaving to ſome tenacious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) as it cannot be eaſily ſevered or expurged, but in ſome fair ſouls; theſe levities are but like ſome looſe duſt or feathers that of themſelves come up, and ſwim upon the top of their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, and ſo may eaſily be ſcum'd off by a gentle hand of reprehenſion, whilſt in fordid and foul mindes, this filth ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to ſuch heavy vices, as keep them in the bottome of their hearts, inſomuch as they ſeem to require ſome ſtorm of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that may move and agitate the deepeſt parts of their ill ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, and by that meanes caſt out all the foul weight together that lay ſunk in the bottome of their hearts.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Some ſpeciall cauſes of the growth of this licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſſe, and ſome expedient propoſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſuppreſſion thereof.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE admiſſion of theſe liberties by well diſpoſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, is derived commonly from the inconſideration of the dignity and duty of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> upon this ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, from him who transfigureth himſelfe into an <hi>Angel of light,</hi> that the maimed and defectuous, were onely forbid the Altar, not debar'd the Congregation; to wit, that Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and immaculateneſſe of converſation is onely required of ſuch, as are ſequeſtred for God, by ſome vow or conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that other vocations need not attend to ſo much cleanneſſe of heart, as is intimated by theſe ſcrupulous ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions, but this flaſh of lightning of the evill Angell will quickly vaniſh, when we turne our eyes upon theſe beames of the Sunne of Righteouſneſſe, which ſhine out ſo fully in theſe words, <hi>Be ye perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <note place="margin">Mark 5.</note> our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſeemeth to preſſe ſo much our purity, as he ſetteth us a higher patern then even himſelfe, (as he did then appeare to the eye of his diſciples) and this ſimilitude injoyn'd cannot poſſibly admit any voluntary adherence to the leaſt unlikeneſſe and diſſimilitude to this exemplar, and how di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanciall the moſt triviall imperfection is from his infinite purity, the Angels themſelves cannot determine: How much ought we then to apprehend the ſlighteſt touch or daſh of our penſill, in the copying this Immaculate Originall?</p>
               <p>If we could diſcern the ſtaynes and taints, even of our beſt workes, wherein we perceive no faultineſſe, we would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver venture the voluntary expoſing any to the ſight of God, wherein we our ſelves find ſpots and blemiſhes, when the man
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:115212:92"/>
after Gods own heart was fain to appeale to Gods mercy for his ſecret and undiſcerned ſinnes; how vain a thing is it to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem any ſinne light or inconſiderable, which we our ſelves are able to diſcover? O what an honour is a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> truſted with, when not onely the rejoycing of <hi>Angels</hi> is within his capacity, but even the ſatisfaction of the <hi>holy-Ghoſt?</hi> which is intimated by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> when he chargeth us not to grieve or make ſad the <hi>holy Spirit;</hi> and certainly all the looſe mirth and jollity wherewith we flatter our nature, is ſo much contriſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his holyneſſe and purity; and alas, how often do theſe impure ſparks of our tongues paſſe to a higher offence? when flying inward they kindle ſuch a flame, as doth extinguiſh the order of the <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> how <hi>little a ſpark ſets a whole wood on fire?</hi> is too frequently atteſted by unhappy experiments in this <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5. 20.</note> kind; wherefore Saint <hi>James</hi> warning us further of the ill conſequences of our tongues diſorder, tells us, that <hi>the tongue is the helme of the whole body,</hi> ſo that if it be ill ſteered, it muſt <note place="margin">James 3.</note> needs miſlead the courſe of our whole lives.</p>
               <p>Nothing methinks evidenceth more the faultineſſe of theſe libertyes, then that the preſence of any notedly good and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous perſon, doth commonly reſtrain ſuch freedomes of ſpeech; doth not this forbearance avow their unjuſtifiablenes, and reproach the idleneſſe of our inconſideration, while we forget the continuall preſence of Almighty God? in reference whereunto, we are preſſed even by inſtinct, to pay this reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto men, of vailing our looſe inclinations; if the eyes even of the children of light, are able to diſpell theſe foule miſts, the conſideration of the preſence of the Father of lights though in an inviſible manner, may well diſſipate the matter of theſe meteors, the ſubſtance whereof, is alwayes earthy and viſcous, though the flame be never ſo bright: for the ſubject of laſcivious words, is alwaies ſordid and unclean, though the flame of fancy they glitter in be of never ſo clear and ſharp conceptions.</p>
               <p>The beſt expedient then in order to the bridling our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly fancyes, is, to awe them often with the preſence of God,

               <p>Let us not therefore be deceived with this vulgar diverſion, to wit, that theſe freedoms of diſcourſe are harmeleſſe and allowable, there is no action of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> inconſiderable to God, our recreations muſt be of the ſame ſpecies as our prayers, though not of the ſame degrees of intenſive fineneſſe, they muſt be both of the ſame nature of innocence, though not adequate in the meaſures of purity; we may ſay methinks not improperly of our recreations and devotions, that the firſt muſt be holy, as the laſt are holy, in the ſame ſenſe, that we muſt be perfect, as our heavenly Father is perfect, which is, in point of ſimilitude, not in a degree of equality; <hi>ſuch as analogy muſt the pleaſures of a Chriſtian hold with his prayers of being reſembling, though not commenſurate in Sanctity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may well infer, what an obligation of purity Saint <hi>Paul</hi> layeth upon <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>Thoſe that are baptized have put on Chriſt,</hi> if we are to conſider our ſelves as clothed with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> how can we be too curious and circumſpect in point of keeping ſuch a veſtiment unſpotted? methinks this ſhould be a good glaſſe for thoſe who are ſo curious and neat in their materiall clothes and dreſſings, wherein the leaſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becomingnes or diſorder is ſo much examined; for by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion from theſe words of the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> they may ſee with <note place="margin">Eccleſiaſtes</note> what degree of purity they are incharged, methinks this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect may well move them to an exact candour and cleanli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in their converſation, which is recommended by the <hi>holy

               <p>Referring to this depravation, there is one familiar iniquity, which deſerveth a particular animadverſion, which is, this, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of letting our tongues runne full counter to this <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> precept, of <hi>Watch leſt you enter into temptation.</hi> For alas how frequent is this practiſe of watching to lead all words in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to temptation, by binding and ſtraining even the modeſt

words of others into a crooked and laſcivious ſenſe, this viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe argueth a great ſullneſſe of the evill ſpirit, when it runs over with ſuch a waſte, even upon the words of our neighbour; and well conſidered, me thinks this is one of the moſt cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable parts of this licentiouſneſſe, in regard it laboureth to taint the whole body of converſation, as it corrupteth the nature of words, which are the <hi>Publique Faith,</hi> whereupon all innocent diſcourſe muſt needs truſt it ſelfe; ſo that this perverſion ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a publick impediment to the commerce of all vertuous communication; wherefore this diſtorting of equivocall words, which paſſeth commonly for a triviall peccancy, if it be well examined, will be found a very dangerous admiſſion; for me thinks this may be termed a verball adultery, as it vitiateth and corrupts the property of another, which would have remained innocent without that ſollicitation, and therefore ſeemeth much a fouler fault, then a ſingle incontinency of our own words.</p>

               <p>And ſince the weaknes of the world looketh commonly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on women, as the only Judges of their behaviour before them, when the Judges are conceived to be receivers, wee may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine to what a height this theft of liberty is likely to grow, and ſurely theſe light indecencies may be fitly compared to the children that theeves uſe to carry along with them, to put into windowes, which after they have crept in, open the doores to them that employ them, ſince very little freedomes ſtealing at firſt in at the eares, do often open the way to greater liberties, that expect an entry by the overtures ſhall be made by theſe firſt encroachments upon modeſty, ſo that women (who have their baſhfullnes and pudency given them for a guard of their weaknes and frailties) muſt beware of any ſurpriſall of this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard: Let thoſe who are ſo baſhfull and cautious in any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent diſcovery of their bodies, know, that the admiſſion and countenancing of this wantonneſſe, is a detection of the naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their minds, which may prove the farre more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous temptation: I do not ſay but their honour may be kept alive in this ill aire of idle diſcourſe, but certainly the unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſſe thereof, induceth but a crazie conſtitution.</p>
               <p>Let therefore all vertuous and wel-affected minds be choiſe in the ayre of their converſation, for though this unſound one do not change the features of their vertue, it will ſpoyle at leaſt the complexion of it; all theſe ſtaining levities are a ſort of freckles that appeare upon the face of their piety, which taketh off much of the fairneſſe and beauty of it.</p>

                  <hi>of Love;</hi> for ſince Love is the firſt impulſe and motion of our intellectuall appetite, (which is the Will) towards an union
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:115212:98"/>
with what it apprehends under the notion of good; if God be rightly apprehended as the ſupreame good, and our Loves primarily directed to that union, then all our affections deſcend from that due elevation, upon the lower ſtations of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as upon ſtepps ſet in order by God, for our affections to paſſe down upon his workes, and repaſſe again upon the ſame gradations up to the Creator: Therefore we muſt examine whether that ſtate of mind which the world termeth <hi>(being in Love)</hi> admit of this order, wherein conſiſteth the vertue of all Devotion.</p>
               <p>I have before treated and defined what it is <hi>to be Devout,</hi> ſo I conceive it expedient now to determine what it is <hi>to be in Love;</hi> for as there are many antipathy's, which while they are out of the preſence of one another, diſcover not their repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancies, but being ſet together do quickly declare their averſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo if we ſtate prophane and ſacred love by one another, we ſhall the eaſilier diſcerne whether there be any incompatibility between them, for he <hi>who transfigureth himſelfe into an Angell of light,</hi> doth more artificially diſguiſe this paſſion then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and preſenteth it to our minds under the faireſt notion he can utter it, knowing that Love is the beſt colour he can uſe in his own transfiguration.</p>
               <p>I have already deſcribed Devotion to you in theſe familiar termes of <hi>(a being in love with Heaven,)</hi> whereby I conclude, that <hi>being in Love is the moſt intenſive appropriation of all the powers of our mind to one deſigne;</hi> now how ſuch an aſſignment <note place="margin">A deſcription of being in Love.</note> of our Soule to the love and ſervice of the creature, (which is to be in love with one) can conſiſt with the precept of loving the Creator with all our heart and all our mind, is a queſtion too hard for even the Devill to reſolve; therefore to reconcile Paſſion with Devotion, he doth commonly detract ſomewhat from them both, in his definitions of them to us, repreſenting it as a leſſe alienation and tranſaction of the mind to be in love, and a leſſe exaction on the ſoule to be devout.</p>
               <p>Thus mans firſt ſupplanting Counſellor offereth himſelfe for a reconciler of this inconſiſtency, and pretendeth to accord
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:115212:98"/>
theſe two loves, as we uſe to compoſe civill differences, where likely each party doth remit ſome of his intereſt to facilitate the agreement; and thus many taking off ſomewhat from the nature of humane paſſion, and abating ſome of the rights of divine Love, think they may both concurre in the ſoule by this arbitration; as who ſhould ſay, when God is allowed the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preameſt part in formall adoration, the creature may ſhare in the inferiour portion of the mind, which is the ſeate of Paſſion, and be allowed a love to a degree of Paſſion: Many are decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by this, as with an equall compoſition, which truly exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, is to conclude, that if the Arke be ſet in the quire, <hi>Dagon</hi> may ſtand in the body of the Church; but he whoſe Temple our heart is, alloweth no independent love to the creature to ſtand by his at any diſtance; all our affections muſt reſt invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in his Love, and muſt iſſue from thence upon the creature, but as by commiſſion and delegation from that maſter Love: So I may ſay of ſuch compounders, that pretend there may be ſome of the heart allotted to ſupport humane Paſſion, as was ſaid of the inhabitants of <hi>Samaria</hi> after the captivity, wherein were mixed the <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Babilonians, Theſe feare the Lord, but ſerve their Idols;</hi> for indeed they who give not God all their <note place="margin">Kin. 4. 17. 41.</note> Love, give what they do, chiefly to his feare, and ſo may be ſaid to feare God, not to love him, but to ſerve and love their paſſions.</p>
               <p>Yet it may be there are ſome who being frighted with the preciſeneſſe and amplitude of the precept of loving God, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avow me in my definition of being in Love, ſaying I have done an ill office to humane Paſſion in this exaltation of it, putting it upon a claime of ſo great rights, as muſt needs make a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell between it and Devotion, when they pretend they do co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant between their eyes and their affections, in the admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of beauty, for the preſerving the prerogative of divine Love; alleadging that all the vehemency of their affections, is in order to the eſtimation of the excellency and perfection of Gods workes, and diſclaime any infringing the rights of Religion.</p>
               <p>This is commonly anſwered by ſome when they are before
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:115212:99"/>
grave and pious examiners, when they find themſelves fallen, as I may ſay among Gods party, then they have his word rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to paſſe with, but when they come off to their own ſide, when they are giving account of their paſſions to thoſe perſons they ſerve under, then commonly they take all occaſions to do all ill offices to divine Love, and ſtudy to affront Devotion, as if it were a Rivall that pretended to that affection for which they are in ſuite, and then the entirenes of the oblation of their minds is what they moſt inſiſt upon; and God knoweth Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is not ſo much as thought upon, unleſſe it be to take from it ſome divine tearmes, to ſet out the offering of their paſſion.</p>

                  <p>Some ſubtile temptations detected, and liberties reproved.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>PRophane Paſſion is a flame in our ſenſitive Appetite, which doth commonly refine and ſubtilize the faculty of our imagination, enabling the fancy very much to circumvent the reaſon, ſuggeſting this beliefe to many, that we may eaſily proportion a correſpondence between our affections to ſenſible and ſpirituall objects, ſetting them in the due ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination of the ſence to the underſtanding; and when this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is ſettled in our minds, we are perſwaded there may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed this intelligence, (which paſſeth often between the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt diſtances of degrees) that what appertaines properly to the dignity of ſpiritualities, may be borrowed ſometimes inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently, and applyed to adorne and grace the worth of materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all goods: and after this manner I ſuppoſe we may accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date theſe attributes of <hi>divine and heavenly,</hi> and many other ſuch jewels of the <hi>crown of God,</hi> to illuſtrate the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of corporeall bleſſings.</p>
               <p>In this method many Lovers ſeeme to thinke they may uſe Gods ſpirituall Altar, as we do his material Altars in Churches
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:115212:99"/>
from whence the ornaments are borrowed and tranſpoſed from one to another, according to different ſolemnities, for many uſe as familiarly all the proprietyes of divine love for the gracing of their paſſion, as if God had lent them his attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to ſet off the ſhrine of their affections, which do uſually ſtand dreſſed up with Sacred veſſels, with all the termes of veneration and adoring, and thus doth our unfaithfull coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor perſwade us in effect to ſet up altar againſt altar, upon pretence of a faire correſpondence between Grace and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>This is truly to <hi>be blinded by the God of this world,</hi> (as the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle</hi> ſaith) to treat any ſuch compartition of our heart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our faith and our fancy, applying alternatively the ſame expreſſions of eſtimation to them both, when we know all the appurtenances to Gods altar, are ſo faſtned to it by his own hand, as the very borrowing of them for ſecular uſes is ſacriledge.</p>
               <p>The ſame compoſition of <hi>oyntment,</hi> which God did appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate to the ſervices of the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> was forbid to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd upon bodyes in the delicacies of the fleſh, under the ſame paine as ſacriledge, and that confection of perfumes, which was peculiarly Gods odour, was not to be compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for any common application; and when we poure out ſo familiarly Gods attributes upon our loves, as an unction of ſuavity and delicacies upon fleſh and blood, and perfume our paſſions with the ſame compoſition of prayſes and exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are properly affected to divine uſes; we do certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incur this kind of irreligious preſumption, and how fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar this looſe effuſion is of all the moſt Sacred termes upon this ſubject of our paſſion, I need not argue, but enter this ill cuſtome as a high indignity to God, though it paſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly for no more then a light intemperancy of the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy which is little queſtioned; truly it is moſt an end the foul ardor kindled in the heart, that ſeeths this uncleane froth out of the mouth which ſtaineth all the Moral virtues it toucheth; for prophaneneſſe taints wit, and civility, and all other good
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:115212:100"/>
qualities it runnes through; and ſo though prophane love may ſharpen the brain, it alwayes ſowreth the heart, which is the veſſell of devotion; if there be then many <hi>hearts farre from God, while they honour him with their lips,</hi> we may ſafely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude no heart can be neer to God, while the lips are ſo farre from honouring him, as leading out his propertyes.</p>
               <p>Wherefore let no body preſume that they may innocently convert a <hi>hymne</hi> into an <hi>Iopean,</hi> that is, to transferre the prerogative prayſes of divinity to the flattery of his owne <hi>Diana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the religion of the heathen <hi>Romanes,</hi> every one had their houſhold gods, that did not derogate from the honor of thoſe they worſhipped in the Temples, each one was allowed his <hi>Genius,</hi> each family their <hi>Penates</hi> for familiar gods at home, which they obſerved &amp; loved more, though they feared not ſo much as their ſtate gods: methinks they that would maintaine a conſiſtancie betweene thoſe two altars of humane paſſion, and divine love, take the priviledges of that religion allowing themſelves their <hi>Genius</hi> or fancy for a domeſtick god, which they affect more, though they acknowledge not ſo much as their Church of God.</p>
               <p>But the reaſon why the Gods of the heathens did admit this aſſociation, was, that they were not jealous Gods, and cared as little for the ſingleneſſe of the heart, as they knew the ſecrets thereof; whereas our God is juſt the contrary, both a jealous and an Omniſcient God; and as all hearts are his, not onely by creation, but by purchaſe with no leſſe a price then all his love, ſo it cannot be expected, he ſhould receive hearts back againe with leſſe then all their love.</p>

               <p>MEthinks paſſionate lovers, who know nothing ſo well as the nature of jealouſie, (which ſtudyeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually the anotamy of hearts, and is ſo ſevere to the leaſt defective part,) ſhould not hope to paſſe any inſincerity upon a jealous God, if they did not ſtudy too much the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of jealouſie, and too little the nature of God, for if they attended that, it would ſhew them God cannot be jealous, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of man, where jealouſie implyes doubt and perplexity of inquiry; for to God the ſecrets of hearts are manifeſt, even while they are ſecrets to themſelves, he precon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth what all hearts ſhal ever freely conceive; &amp; ſo God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth himſelfe a jealous God, as knowing the nature of humane jealouſie, (which is ſo ſenſible of the leaſt ſubſtraction from what we affect) to aſſure us by that title, he can admit no participation in what he vouchſafes to love.</p>
               <p>It is to inlighten man in the knowledge of his ſeverity, not to obſcure the beliefe of his omniſcience, that he cals himſelfe a jealous God, which quality is as propitious in Gods love as it is malignant in mans; for humane jealouſie among all the falſities it ſuggeſts for our diſquiet, telleth us but one impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant truth, (and that we ſeem to believe little by the eagernes of our ſolicitations) which is the infidelity and variableneſſe of all humane loves, that are ſo unfaithfull, as our greateſt paſſions are commonly unſecured by our tenderneſſe and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, and Gods jealouſie aſſureth us of the immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of his love, which we can looſe onely by our not being jealous of it, for the more watches we ſet over it in our lips, and the more guards in our hearts, the more it is obliged by this circumſpection: nor muſt we think to keep it ſafe in our
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:115212:101"/>
hearts, while the doors of our lips ſtand open to all the paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of a prophan and libertine tongue; ſo that if we make a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious reflexion on it, there is none of Gods attributes ſo ſure a guide for our way to him, as a jealous God.</p>
               <p>Whereupon I may well ask the <hi>Synagogue of Libertines</hi> this pueſtion of Saint <hi>James, Do you thinke that the Scripture ſaith in vain, The Spirit that dwelleth in you, covets you even to emulation,</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> explicates this, <note place="margin">James 4. 5.</note> when to indeare his zeale to ſoules, he calls it <hi>the emulation of God,</hi> and we know God is not as man that he may be deceived; the ſame Spirit is jealous of us, which <hi>peirceth and divideth</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>aſunder the ſoule and the Spirit, and is the diſcerner of the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 4. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>thoughts and intents of the heart;</hi> Therefore they who look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the beauty of Gods love, in the beams of his mercy, ſhould alwayes reflect upon the ſhadow of his love, which is his jealouſie, and is inſeparable from the ſubſtance of his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</p>
               <p>But commonly Libertine lovers, when they raiſe their thoughts as high as God, look upon <hi>his mercyes being above all his works,</hi> and account that as a City of refuge, whereunto they can eaſily flie for protection of theſe kind of infirmities of nature, pleading all their offences to be rather occaſionall frailties, then purpoſed infidelities to God; and ſo while they have this attribute of Gods mercy in their eye, like <hi>the hill ſeated upon a mountaine,</hi> they think they cannot looſe their way to it, though they loyter and wander in their youth out of the ſtrait and narrow way; ſtraying by the light excurſions of their paſſion.</p>
               <p>And certainly no one ſinne hath miſled more, then this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Piety, in which the Devill is a diligent advocate for Gods mercy; For all active vitiouſneſſe, hath a kind of hot feavor, which keeps the conſcience awake at leaſt, but this rowling between mercy and juſtice, is a certaine motion, that very often rocketh the conſcience into a drowſineſſe till our laſt ſleep; after which, the worm it wanted, never lets it reſt againe; How many ſay with <hi>Chriſt, Yet a little and the world
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:115212:101"/>
ſhall not ſee me,</hi> who go out of the world, in this ſtretching of <note place="margin">Iohn 14. 19.</note> themſelves in a <hi>little more ſleep, a little more ſlumber?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore I will recommend one jealouſie to lovers, which think themſelves ſecure of Gods mercy, by being but looſe ſutors for it, let me propoſe to them to be very jealous of it, I am ſure they can know nothing of Gods heart, which ought to make them confident of his mercy, longer then they are actually watching it, for it is ſeriouſly true in this caſe (what is familiarly ſaid to juſtifie vain jealouſie) that we cannot love mercy much, and not be jealous of it; nay I may add, that the very apprehenſion of the inſecurity of it is the fruition of this love, for it is a poſſeſſion of mercy to be ſolicitous and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in feare of loſing it; in this ſenſe <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed is</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 28, 14. Pſa. 118.</note>

               </p>
               <p>But alas, prophane paſſion is commonly a derider of all holy fear, and accepts onely that which vaine jelouſie impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth on her, and ſo the fear paſſion hath, proves rather a curſe then a cuſtody for her love; for the feares of lovers may be properly ſaid to be ſuch, as the <hi>Wiſe-man</hi> elegantly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes in the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> darkneſſe, when their fire afforded them no light, and thoſe flaſhes of lightning which paſſed by <note place="margin">Sapi. 17.</note> them, did but fright them ſo much the more; &amp; being ſo terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with what they ſaw, they concluded that much more hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid which they ſaw not, and thus their <hi>feare proved nothing to them, but a betrayer of the ſuccours of reaſon:</hi> I need not put this on upon a lovers jealouſie, to try if it wil ſerve it by an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of thoſe qualityes, for it will appeare to any body that knoweth it as appoſite and fit as if it had been made by the meaſure of that paſſion; therefore I may wel conclude that love to be very unhappy, which rejects all Pious feare, and accepteth willingly this perplexing terrour.</p>

               <p>VAin paſſion is ſo malignant, as it corrupteth the beſt power of mindes, which is love, and perverteth the beſt quallity of bodyes, which is beauty: nay it is ſo apt to make a wrong uſe of all beauty, as it doth commonly miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply <hi>the beauty of grace, which is mercy;</hi> for it ſetteth our thoughts too much upon that faire delightfull attribute of God, and ſeldome alloweth his juſtice a due proportion of them; for many lovers acquaint themſelves with Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> did converſe with <hi>Chriſts</hi> perſon, they are <hi>heires of Gods mercy, and eat and drink with it</hi> familiarly, but have no intelligence with his other attributes; and ſo when <note place="margin">Luke 13. 15.</note> they come to claime that acquaintance with it, of having been taught and fed by it, they are in danger to be diſclaimed, with <hi>I know you not, depart from me;</hi> mercy ſhall not then know them, for their having been too familiar with her, no more then God ſhall own the acquaintance of ſwearers, who have beene ſo familiar with him; thereforethe Wiſe-man giveth them an excellent counſell, <hi>Say not the mercy of the Lord is great, and he will have pitty on the multitude of my</hi>

                  <hi>ſinnes, for his mercy and his anger are neer one another, and his anger looketh upon ſinners,</hi> and moſt of all when they look not upon his anger.</p>
               <p>For this reaſon, lovers who uſually ſet before their eyes mercy put before juſtice, ſhould uſe mercy not as a cover, but as a Criſtal, onely to look through it upon the figure of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, in which it may intenerate and ſoften ſomewhat the hard ſtrokes of that figure, for the ſeverity of Gods judgements may well be ſweetened by this tranſparent ſuperveſture of his kindneſſe: but when mercy is laid as a covering which too much obſcureth juſtice to us, then likely the more we look
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:115212:103"/>
upon it, the more we ſee our paſſion in it, and the love of God the leſſe for hope, which vaine paſſion findeth a virtue in our hearts, it commonly leaveth a vice, by flattering hope into exceſſe, and corrupteth it often by the art of overpraiſing it, and ſo leadeth it imperceptibly up to preſumption; therefore I may properly ſay to many lovers preſuming on mercy, as Saint <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> did to ſuch a kind of confidence, think not <hi>to ſay within your ſelves we have Abraham for our father, but bring forth works worthy of repentance;</hi> let them not think mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy <note place="margin">Mat. 3.</note> is intailed to the ſtock of their confidence, but ſtated upon the conformity and fidelity of their lives; for thoſe that do the works of <hi>Abraham,</hi> are onely his ſonnes, the children of feare and trembling are the onely heires of mercy.</p>
               <p>But there are many mindes that ſeeme made of ſuch a ſtuffe as was forbid the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which was a contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of linnen and wollen, (which command did figuratively intimate, that ſimplicity and intireneſſe was to be the garment of the inward man) againſt this rule many pretend they can weave purity and paſſion together, and keep their minds ſound and innocent in this compoſition, and for this conſorting hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane love, is very intuentive and ingenious in deſigning faire and ſpecious termes of ſubordination, in which this love pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it may conſiſt, and be limited under divine love.</p>
               <p>But many (who pretended at firſt to keep their affections running through the beauty of the creature, in a regular re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:115212:104"/>
which is yet more fickle fancy; nevertheleſſe, in theſe broken veſſels do men truſt their love, when they are even in the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt or ſtrongeſt paſſion, ſince inordinate love is ſo unſafe a conſerve for our happyneſſe, as even our own wiſhes cannot fixe it long upon one object, and our reaſon can much leſſe weigh it by graines as our owne wills take it from our ſenſes, and ſo keep our love to the creature in ſuch a proportion, as it may be tryed by the ballance of the ſanctuary, whether it have juſt that quantity which is allowed our affection to the <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore let none perſwade themſelves they can keep their affections running on currently through particular inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, back to the Univerſall center of love, and upon that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence licenſe many inſinuating familiarities with women, for it is very hard even for the moſt purified humane affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to fall from beauty (where nature maketh ſo many fences to ſtay them,) to paſſe on without making ſome eddyes in a reluctant motion, looking backward with a profeſſion of ſome unwillingneſſe to paſſe ſo quickly forward in that courſe of purity they ſhould continue; and if (as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith), the <note place="margin">Peter 4.</note> ſevereſt watchers of their nature have task hard enough, what ſhall be hoped of the indulgers of it? certainly they who will cheriſh nature in her firſt appetites, ſhall quickly finde her ſecond paſt their checking, and then as the <hi>Wiſe-man</hi> ſaith in this caſe, <hi>Who wil pitty a ſorcerer that is ſtung with a Serpent?</hi> for they who are familiar with temptations, will quickly be acquainted with infection; let them remember then our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters counſell, that will have their body kept lighted, <hi>to keep their eye pure,</hi> ſince the Prince of darkneſſe obſerveth a rule quite contrary to the firſt law of the Father of light; for when he hath put out an eye of his ſervants, he doth not releaſe him, but makes him the more ſlave.</p>

                  <p>The faultineſſe and flatteries to women diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and diſſwaded.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>NOthing hath more perplexed the animoſity of man, then the ſearch into the nature and tranſmiſſion of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall ſinne, which the curioſity of woman produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: it ſeemeth God is pleaſed to puniſh that firſt preſumption in point of knowledge, with a perpetuall perplexity of doubt in the very thing which was then introduced into nature, and the onely one of mans own making, which he did by yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to woman, who furniſhed him the matter whereunto he gave the forme of Originall ſinne, and ever ſince they have both conſpired to pervert the greateſt bleſſings of their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall nature into occaſions of propagating ſin, for the ſame ſeeds of vain glory ſpring up upon all invitations.</p>
               <p>The firſt temptation that prevailed upon woman, was her becomming like God, and the ſame tempter ſeemeth to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy mans paſſion to performe his promiſe, ſo that it is upon his commiſſion men offer all thoſe prophane flatteries by which they worſhip their paſſions, and yet even all theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous expreſſions of paſſion teſtify that all our love ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth to God for theſe miſ-intended exceſſes unawares, ſet the right ſuperſcription upon the addreſſes of their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when they ſet divinity and adoreableneſſe as the titles whereunto their loves are directed; and ſo their tongues as it were by inſtinct, declare the property of love to be Gods, while they cannot call them leſſe then Gods to whom they miſgive their love; and love which by nature and inſtinct is ſo converſant with God, may eaſily ſlip into this miſtake; for as when we are bred and habituated to one company, we are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry apt to call thoſe we ſpeak to by accident, by thoſe names
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:115212:105"/>
which are moſt familiar to us; ſo love, which by nature is moſt intimate with God, when it is by accident diverted to other company, ſeemeth to miſtake their names, and gives them that which is ſo imprinted in it, and yeeldeth them the ſame reverence proper to that title; thus even the fartheſt removes of their affections from God, are remembrances of their loves, being intirely due to him, when even the poſſeſſed tongues like the evill ſpirits in the Goſpel do teſtifie Gods right.</p>
               <p>There is nothing ſure the devil hateth more then beauty, it is ſo much his contrariety, who is all fouleneſſe and deformity, yet there is nothing he flatters ſo much; he ſerveth it with the ſupplenes of a Paraſite till he gain his ends by it, and being the beſt Artiſt, with a gentle hand he layeth freſh colours of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes on the externall figure of beauty every day, whereby Gods Image is quickly ſo covered, as they who admire it moſt, take no notice, (unleſſe it be profanely) of any ſuch character upon it; and the Glaſſe this ſervant holdeth to Women, makes them no reflex, but of thoſe vain colours of flatteries which he hath laid upon the Figure; and thus as at firſt he deceived woman by credulity in expectance, now he ſeemes to delude her by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, that ſhee is poſſeſſed of all his aſcriptions to her, and beauty ſet under this burning glaſſe of praiſes and admirations, eaſily lighteth ſelfe Love in the heart, which is a flame catches at all materials that are offered to entertain it: nor is there any thing ſo apt to ſoment ſelfe-love, as that Straw and Stubble of light prayſes which the paſſions of others caſt upon it.</p>
               <p>Whence it is, that prophane lovers do as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Walke in the light of their own fire, and in the ſparkles which they</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eſay 50. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>have kindled,</hi> while abuſing the liableneſſe of woman to ſelfe-love and vanity, they are continually ſtriking fire out of their fancies upon this tinder, that is, ſtraining their wits to caſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive praiſes upon this ſo taking Subject of Womans beauty, wherein men ſhould be very temperate, knowing <hi>how little a ſparke fireth the whole Wood,</hi> and turneth all the goods of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into jewels for Pride, and Vain-glory, the flame whereof <note place="margin">Jam. 3. 6.</note>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:115212:105"/>
is ſo deceitfull, as when we believe it polnteth upward, to the honour of our Maker, it tendeth downward to the centre of fire, without light, for the fire of ſelf-love, as it is kindled by the breath of the Father of Lies, ſo it partaketh of the quality of his flames to be without light, ſince it keepeth us in darknes to our ſelves, and imper-ception of our own true dimenſions.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it muſt needs lye as a heavier charge upon men then they uſually account it, the breaking this bruiſed Reed by preſsing ſo much flattery upon it, for the aptnes which beauty hath to raiſe ſelfe-love, may be reputed an allay of the naturall bleſſing thereof; it may be this propenſity to ſelfe-deceiving, is ſet as another Fine upon womans head for her firſt fault, and the facility of her minds conceiving, and the pleaſure of bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this ſpirituall iſſue of ſelfelove, is another kind of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon her firſt credulity; and to be thus endangered in her ſoule by the pleaſure of her beſt materiall property, which is beauty, ſeemeth a greater penalty, then the ſorrow of her other labour: Upon which ground Lovers do likely treate at firſt by Parly, to introduce ſelfe-love into the heart by the Preſents of flatteries; and certainly more are betrayed by Natures intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence with the ſubtilty of adulation, then taken by the breach of intereſt: For indeed ſelfe-love in woman hath a ſtrange qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, the more it perſwades her to over-value her ſelfe, the more it tempteth her to caſt her ſelfe away, and ſo men cheapen their bargain moſt, by commending what they would have.</p>
               <p>Therefore let not even thoſe (who, without any deſigne do ſuffer their tongues to ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

their own fancy; and thus their wits ſerve the Tempter, as <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathans</hi> Page did his maſter; for they carry Arrowes which <note place="margin">1 Reg. ch. 20.</note> the Devill ſhootes upon Deſign, though they are not privie to the intention.</p>
               <p>It is no wonder that fraile woman ſhould be ſo much decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the colours and features of all their good qualities, ſince the Devill and Man joyne and ſtudy nothing ſo much as to make them flattering reflexes of their perſons, and powers of their mind; and ſo woman is entertained commonly in her firſt manner of deluſion, for that is ſtill taken from her, which ſhee believeth is given her; the being like God, for her innocence, is a much better reſemblance of God, then mans vain adoration.</p>
               <p>But let not men thinke they have an eaſie account to make for all thoſe levities which they expoſe ſo handſomely, as wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens eyes are deceived by thoſe falſe lights, for that which will prove an aggravation of mens faults, will ſerve as an extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting circumſtance for womens defence; their wit and dexter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, may deduct ſomewhat from the guilt of womans treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, for ſhe may plead now ſome commiſerablenes, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>the man who was given me, as my ſentence to obey, deceived me,</hi> and as one of the reaſons given, why God did compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the fall of Man, and not of Angels, is, that they ſinned without any exteriour ſollicitation; ſo certainly abuſed woman ſhall find this circumſtance as ſome interceſſion for her, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſaulted by a forreigne power of temptation, which may move God the eaſilyer to call ſuch to him, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> did the Woman, who had a ſpirit of infirmity ſo long upon her, that tyed her from looking upward; and <hi>Chriſt</hi> giveth this reaſon for his calling her, when ſhe did not it ſeemeth thinke on him, that ſhe was bound by <hi>Sathan,</hi> and ſhe is a good figure of the <note place="margin">Luk. 31. 11.</note> infirmity of her Sex, which is eaſily overcome and bound by the violence of exterior temptations; wherefore God doth more eaſily commiſerate their fallen frailties, and calleth them with more pitie then he doth the ſtronger Sex, which have the crime of abuſing their ſtrength towards the others defection: Wee can but hope that the <hi>Samaritane</hi> Lover was compriſed in the <note place="margin">Ioh. 4.</note>

               <p>Let no body then truſt to any confederacy between the fleſh &amp; the ſpirit which is of humane loves making, for, of all recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled enemies, the fleſh is leaſt to be truſted after the accord, and love the leaſt for the arbitration; therefore let none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve their ſouls out of danger, becauſe in the firſt paces of their paſsion, they meet no inſolent temptations that face them, and declare the danger of their advance, for the Devill keepes like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his firſt Method ſtill, with thoſe he findeth in the ſtate of innocence, he taketh the ſhape of the ſerpent, and creeps up by inſinuation, and then changeth his ſhape into the figure of his power, and this tranſmigration of the evil ſpirits, from one body into another, is truer then the fancy of <hi>Pythagoras;</hi> for we find often this <hi>Metamorphoſis</hi> of the devill from the form of a dove unto a ſerpent, &amp; from a lamb into a lion, ſince it is the ſame ſpirit that moves in the poetical doves of <hi>Venus,</hi> as was acting in <hi>Eves</hi> ſerpent, &amp; thus what hath at firſt in our love an innocent form, paſſeth quickly into a venemous nature.</p>
               <p>Wherefore ſevere caution, and repulſe of the firſt motions of our ſenſitive appetite, is the onely guard our ſoules can truſt againſt our bodyes in this caſe: for certainly many lovers ſink into temptations in which they periſh, as ſome do that wade themſelves unawares beyond their depth, who go into the water at firſt, with caution and ſecurity as they believe, and are carefull to find ground at every advance of one of their legs, but when the water gets to a certaine height, though they feel ground ſtill, they cannot uſe their legs, which are carried up by the ſtreame before they are out of their depth, and thus they periſh by this ill meaſured confidence: Even ſo the moſt cautious lovers do often caſt themſelves away, for as long as they feel but the feare of God as a ground, they go ſtill upon, and finde no temptations, (which the Scripture fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly figureth to us by waters) force away abſolutely their conſents, (which are the ſouls feet) they think themſelves ſafe,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:115212:109"/>
while they feel the ground of a good reſolution, but comming on by degrees into ſuch a depth of temptation, as the ſenſitive appetite doth ſurreptiouſly lead them into, their feet are eaſily carryed away, and ſo they are loſt by this unexperienced preſumption: and thus as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, we find <hi>There is a way</hi>

                  <hi>which ſeemeth right unto man, but the ends of it are the wayes of death:</hi> Me thinks <hi>Solomons</hi> experience ſhould diſabuſe all men in the relying upon the virtue of their Spirit, when we ſee that his ſo ſingular induement with the <hi>holy Spirit</hi> was not ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty againſt the danger of this preſumption: we are warned by the <hi>Apoſtle, not to extinguiſh the Spirit,</hi> and nothing puts it out ſo ſoon as the bodyes being ſet on fire, the pure immixt fire of the cloven tongues will not hold in long in cloven hearts, they muſt be perfect Holocauſts, which are to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that flame, and when the eyes are but warming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at ſtrange fire, that is, intending onely an innocent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the ſight of beauty, they are often in too much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being taken by this incentive.</p>
               <p>Holy Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> bringeth in <hi>Eve,</hi> looking upon the fruit, while it was ſo yet in her eye, when ſhe ſaw it pleaſant &amp; faire <note place="margin">Geneſis 3.</note> to the eye; and asketh her, why do you look ſo longingly upon your own death? why are you ſo taken in looking upon that, which if you taſt you are loſt? you anſwer, that you do but caſt your eye, and not your hand upon it, and that you are not forbid to ſee, but to eat; O though this be not your actuall crime, yet is it an aptitude thereunto, for while you are thus amuſed, the ſerpent covertly windeth into your heart, firſt by blandiſhments he intangleth your reaſon, and then by falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies he diverteth your fear, affirming you ſhall not ſurely die, and thus ſharpens the curioſity while he ſuggeſteth the cupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, and by theſe degres preſenteth the fruit, and putteth you out of the garden; and this is commonly the event of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Eve,</hi> who entertaine this party with the ſerpent, weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no temptation when it lights firſt upon their eyes, till it fall too heavy on their hearts to be removed,</p>
               <p>Therefore Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> giveth us an excellent adviſe, ſince

the Devill doth watch thy heel, do thou watch his head, which is the beginning of an ill ſuggeſtion; when he proffereth firſt an ill motion, reject it; then, before delectation ariſe, and conſent follow; thus while thou breakeſt his head, he ſhall not be able to bruiſe thy heel. And ſure Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> is one of the beſt Counſellors we can conſult in this caſe, for he reads it decided in that book which he was commanded to take up and read, while he was ſtudying the caſe, which adviſe as it came from the ſame voice, ſo it wrought the ſame effect, <hi>take up thy bed and walk;</hi> for it raiſed him from being bed-rid in this paſſion, and ſet him a walking with him who is <hi>the way, the truth, and the life;</hi> We cannot recuſe Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> as a party againſt this paſſion, when he profeſſeth he had ſtudied long the agreement of it with Piety, therefore let us heare the reſult of his ſtudies.</p>
               <p>All the while he was in this diſceptation, he confeſſeth he found two wils in himſelf, the one carnal, &amp; the other Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; which by a daily contention did ſever and diſſipate his mind: and thus by experience he found the combate between the fleſh and the Spirit, which while his mind ſought to part and reconcile, ſhe was hurt by both parties, conſcience wounded her on the one ſide, and cuſtome ſtruck her on the other, on which ſhe was the moſt ſenſible, ſo as his ſenſes ſway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him commonly to a partiality; thus he ſheweth us the links of that chaine, which lovers by degrees find their wills faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by; an eaſie ſeduced appetite raiſeth paſſion, and that che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, induceth cuſtome, and that uncontrolled imprints ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, which becometh a puniſhment of perverted liberty; for the law of ſinne is the violence of cuſtome, by which the mind is drawne and held at laſt even againſt her owne relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctancie, but deſervedly, for having willingly fallen into this neceſſity, in this manner he confeſſeth that often upon the motions of the Spirit, which invited him to break off all treaty of accord, and to declare for the redemption of his captived appetite, he found himſelfe kept as it were in a ſlumber in theſe meditations of riſing out of that ſoft bed of ſenſuality,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:115212:110"/>
and while he lay ſtretching himſelfe to wake, overcome ſtill by his drowſineſſe, he lay ſtill toſſing in this reſolution.</p>
               <p>And alas, how familiarly do we rowle our ſelves aſleep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in this doubtfull drowſineſſe, while we are halfe awake, purpoſing to riſe and break off our fancyes, dreames, and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions! O then let Saint <hi>Auſtin's</hi> alarum keep us awake, while we are in this halfe-wiſhing or vellity towards our caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the workes of darkneſſe, let us not lie ſtill ſtretching and conſulting our ſenſes, whether the night <hi>be farre ſpent, and the day be at hand,</hi> that is, whether there be not enough of our <note place="margin">Rom. 13. v. 13. 14.</note> youth left to promiſe us time to make our ſelves ready for the laſt day, let us not ſlumber in this rumination, but riſe and put on the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and not lie turning our ſelves to and fro, which is, to <hi>make proviſion for the luſts of the fleſh;</hi> Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> after he had rowſed himſelfe upon this alarum roſe up directly, and ſet himſelfe to ſuch exerciſes as kept him alwayes in that vigilancy which is required, not to enter into temptation, he preſently broke off all treaty with this paſſion, and hath left this excellent teſt for lovers to touch their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, to try if they be of that purity which is onely currant with God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They love God leſſe then they ought, who love any thing beſides God, which they love not for God.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This is to ſtate God in our affections, as he hath proclaimed himſelfe to our faith, to be <hi>the beginning and end of all things;</hi> Now whether a paſſion to the creature can by any compaſſe of humane frailty be drawne into this perfect circle, moving firſt from the love of God, and reflecting ſtill back againe in all the circumference to that firſt point? is a queſtion will be anſwered affirmatively by none, but by him who promiſed man he ſhould become like God; for this is an underſtanding above the ſtraine of humane nature: yet I believe there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lovers ſeduced by this counſellor, who at firſt deſigne this innocent re-conveyance of their affections, paſſing through the creature back to their proper place, and of many of ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors, we may ſay as Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> doth of the <hi>Camell</hi> in

the law, that they <hi>are cleane in the head, but not in the hoof;</hi> they ruminate well, and ſpeculate cleanneſſe and purity in the rationall part, but the feet of their ſoules, which are the ſenſitive appetites, want alwayes their right diviſion, becauſe they remaine too intirely carnall, and ſo the whole becomes illegall in the law of grace: therefore I may ſay it will be hard for ſuch <hi>Camels</hi> to paſſe <hi>in at the narrow gate;</hi> wherefore I ſhall adviſe thoſe well-meaning minds in <hi>Chriſts</hi> name, <hi>He that is thus waſhed, wanteth yet the waſhing his feet,</hi> they muſt indeavor to change and purge their terreſtriall affections <note place="margin">Iohn 13. 13.</note> (which are here typified by the feet) with as much neatneſſe as they can for the impreſſions of corporeall beauties, which at firſt are but as duſt upon their feet, if they be let ſtick upon them, do eaſily turne to ſuch dirt as is not to be got off but by water drawn from the head; teares are required to waſh off that at laſt, which our breath might have blown off at firſt.</p>
               <p>Therefore let them remember <hi>Solomons</hi> admonition, in the <note place="margin">Prov. 23. 33.</note> firſt ſtraynings and impulſes of their frailties, thy eyes ſhall ſee ſtrange women, &amp; thy heart ſhal ſpeak pervers things: we muſt anſwer then our hearts firſt queſtion, before it multiply argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with King <hi>Davids</hi> reſolution, <hi>My heart, and my fleſh rejoyce in the living God,</hi> who indeed is the Eſſence of all beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and goodneſſe, and hath ſuch an immenſity of them, as even they who love not him directly, can love nothing under the notion of faire or good, that is not a part of him, though they be ſo injurious to God as to cover him with his own light, taking the leſſe notice of him, the more they find of his ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude in the creature, they love and honour with his rights: in this caſe we do but like fiſhes who play and leap at the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the ſun, as it is impreſſed upon the fluencie of their element, and take it for the reall ſubſtance: for when we adore the image and copy of beauty, ſhadowed out to us upon the fluent and tranſitory ſuperficies of well coloured fleſh and blood, are we not deluded like fiſhes, with a ſhining image of beauty ſuperficially delineated upon our own fleeting element?

I detect, which is ſo naturally falſe to beauty, as it ſubſiſteth but by betraying beauty, by perverting it into temptation and impurity; whereupon I would preferre reaſon to beauty, to have that truſted only, which may furniſh true joyes enough, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to entertain &amp; delight the owners of it; ſhewing what a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all bleſsing beauty hath, by being made by God one of the beſt opticke glaſſes for the helpe of mans ſpirituall eye, by report from his corporeall in the ſpeculation of divinity; for by this inference of the <hi>Wiſe-man,</hi> he may argue, If we <hi>are delighted with theſe materiall beauties, we may judge how much more beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull and lovely is the Lord and Creator of them:</hi> adding, that by the greatneſſe of the beauty of the creatures, the heathens were inexcuſable, that they did not find the truth of one <note place="margin">Sap. 13. 3.</note> Creator.</p>

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:115212:112"/>
are truly inſlaved by the tyrannies of paſsion.</p>
               <p>Now in anſwer to that queſtion concerning friendſhip with <note place="margin">Friendſhip defined.</note> women, I profeſſe to intend ſo little the diſcrediting of reall friendſhip with them, as I approve it for an excellent preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative againſt the contagiouſneſſe of paſſion, for as paſſion hath been well ſaid to be friendſhip runne mad, ſo friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip may be properly ſtyled ſober paſſion; ſince it hath all the ſpirit and cordiality of the wine of love, without the offenſive fumes and vapors of it, and ſo doth the office of exhilara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the heart, without intoxicating the braine; Inſomuch as we finde, that our friendſhip with the proprietor of what we are tempted to covet, doth often, even by the ſingle virtue of morality, ſuppreſſe thoſe unruly appetites: Therefore when the power of Chriſtianity is joyned to re-inforce it, we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it ſhould much the eaſilier correct frailty of nature.</p>
               <p>It hath been well ſaid of friendſhip, that it is the ſoule of humane ſociety, and if our friendſhip hold this Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy with the ſoul, to be equally intire in every part of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, it is very ſafe with women, if the love be no more in the face then in the feet, as long as it is like a ſoule thus ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtributed, equally in the whole compound of body and mind, it is not in danger of the partiality of paſſion, which never maketh this equall communication of it ſelfe, but lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſolely in the externall figure of the body; and friendſhip thus regularly ſpirituall, may find a ſenſible as well as a lawfull delight in the beauty and lovelyneſſe of the perſon; for beauty hath ſomewhat that affecteth and taketh our nature, which methinks is ſomewhat like to that we call the fire, or the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in diamonds, which are certain rayes of luſter and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that ſeem the Spirit of the whole matter, being equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly iſſued from all parts of it; and ſo there may be a kind of ſpirit, and quickneſſe of joy and delight that may ſhine upon us, from the object of a beautifull perſon, whom we may love ſo ſpiritually, as to conſider nothing in the perſon, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the whole conſiſtence and virtuous integrity of ſoul and body, no more then we do the fire of a diamond apart from the whole ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:115212:113"/>
Thus beauty may innocently raiſe the joy of friendſhip, whiles ſincere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> friendſhip doth ſuppreſſe the danger of beauty, which is onely the kindling of paſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherefore if it be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examined, paſſion which pretendeth to honour beauty, more then friendſhip, will be found but to vilifie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe it; for paſſion uſeth this diamond but as a flint, to ſtrike, materiall ſparkles of luſt out of it, whereas friendſhip lookes upon the fire of this diamond as delighted only with the luſter of nature in the ſubſtance of it, which reflects alwaies the ſplendor of the Creator unto a Pious' and religious love.</p>
               <p>But this high Spirituall point of friendſhip with women, (where we have no defence by conſanguinity againſt the frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of fleſh and blood) is not ſo acceſſable as we ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume eaſily to reach it, many loves have ſtray'd that pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſet out towards it; therefore we cannot be too cautious in this promiſe to our ſelves of ſecurity in ſuch difficulties, for our ſpirit can make no ſuch friendſhip with our fleſh, as to rely upon the fidelity thereof, without his own continuall vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilancy; wherefore S. <hi>Peters</hi> adviſe is very pertinent in theſe <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 17.</note> intelligences, <hi>Converſe in feare in this time of your ſojourning,</hi> for otherwiſe I may preſage to you in the termes of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, Evil ſhall come upon you, and you ſhal not know from whence</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eſay 47. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>it riſeth;</hi> for friendſhip doth often when it is too much preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med upon, rob upon the place it did firſt pretend to guard, being eaſily tempted by the conveniency our ſenſes finde in that truſt: And as thoſe theeves are the hardlieſt diſcovered, that can ſo handſomely change their apparencies, upon the place, as they need not flie upon it; ſo friendſhip when it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauſhed into paſſion, is very hardly detected: For when it is queſtioned by Gods authorized examinants, it reſumeth the lookes and ſimilitude of innocent friendſhip, and ſo remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth undiſcovered, not onely by the exterior inqueſt, but very often it eludeth a ſlight interior ſearch of our own conſcience, thereby proving the moſt dangerous theef in the familiarities with women: For this reaſon I muſt charge this admiſſion of friendſhip towards women, with this clauſe of Saint <hi>Paul,

               <p>NOw then upon theſe evidences, we may fairely caſt paſſion in this charge of Treaſon againſt the Soveraign of all our love, and conſequently, all libertine diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and familiarities with women, may juſtly be noted as Malignants, which legally in Religion ought to be ſequeſtered; nay even friendſhip it ſelfe (with perſons to be feared) lyeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome cloud, as requiring a continual ſuſpitious eye upon it, to keepe it ſafe from all intelligence with ſenſual appetites; in ſo much as when it is ſincereſt, it muſt be watched with great pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to be kept ſafe: for which cauſe in ſtead of all theſe peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous commerces of our love, I will preferre ſo ſecure an object to it, as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith of it, <hi>Love but, and do what you will;</hi> this is the increated beauty of God, in which there is not only no feare to be had of our over-loving it, but even there is no fear of our not being out-loved by it, and ſo our love is alwayes ſecured to us.</p>
               <p>Therefore, O Soule! Why doeſt thou halt and heſitate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the loving him, who muſt needs love thee faithfully? and art ſo prone to love that, which if it love thee at all, muſt do it perfidiouſly, either deceiving thee or ſome other: thou ſhalt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be unhappy in loving ſuch, which if another love, thou

               <p>You then, that by love ſeeke contentment, why do you love that, which even the loving of, is diſquiet?

               <p>WHen <hi>Eſdras</hi> had cleared to the ſeduced people, that the Law of God could not diſpenſe with <note place="margin">1 Eſd. 10. 12.</note> their retaining of ſuch ſtrange women of the Land as lay in their boſomes, they pleaded for ſome time to make this painfull divorce, ſaying, <hi>It was not the worke of a day or two:</hi> So methinks, many who are convinced in this point, of the prohibition of this alien and ſtrange conjunction of our Love, which is the child of God; with vain paſſion, the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the earth, pretend that by degrees they will ſever this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity from their loves, becauſe it requireth ſome time, and much grace to make this diviſion.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe, it is not the worke of a few good motions or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſes, it asketh as it were a melting and liquefaction of our hearts, to ſeparate this droſſe from the pure ſubſtance of love; but we are ſo much furthered towards this operation, as the fire we muſt worke it in coſteth nothing but the asking: It is that which the <hi>Spouſe</hi> ſaith, <hi>are coales of fire, and have a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment flame,</hi> and hath a ſpeciall vertue to purge and calcine our <note place="margin">Cant. 8. 6.</note> affections; according to the Prophets advice, <hi>of ſeparating the pure from the impure:</hi> and we may confidently call for this fire downe from heaven, by the Spirit of our maſter to conſume

theſe his enemies, <hi>the concupiſcence of the eye, and the concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence of the fleſh,</hi> that are the oppoſers of this purgation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement of our hearts which he demandeth of us, as ſilver ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times tryed.</p>
               <p>Reflecting upon the exactnes of this receiver of hearts, if we reſolve to trade with our loves for the Kingdome of heaven, we muſt examine ſincerely what temper of purity is currant with God; for as paſsion doth both lighten and vitiate them in one kind, ſo is there another ſort of droſſines in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which doth often too much imbaſe our love, by an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allay of ſelfe reſpect, that rendereth it too mercenary, and of too low a value: it is very requiſite then to be rightly enformed of the Standard by whoſe purity all our love, that paſſeth for the purchaſe of the Kingdom of heaven, muſt be tryed &amp; teſted.</p>
               <p>In our contract for heaven, there is a ſtrange ſingularity, ſince both the paiment and the purchaſe, are one and the ſame thing; differing only in degrees of intenſion and purification; for infirme and imperfect love is our price, and love perfected and conſummate is our poſſeſsion; namely, God who is love is all; &amp; <note place="margin">1 Ep.

                     </gap>.</note> as love is the beſt thing even in heaven as well as in earth, it is conſonantly appointed for the chiefe commerce between them: wherefore God asketh but the heart of man even for all him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, &amp; knowing that the heart in the moſt entire tranſaction of it ſelfe in this life, can remit but imperfect and defective love: we muſt examine ſeverely what rates of imperfectnes God ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth in our affections; for in favour of our poverty, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth ſome part of our payment, in that which is, as I may ſay, the baſe money of our nature, mercenary love, which he alloweth for the conveniency of our indigent and decayed eſtate.</p>
               <p>Methinks by this alluſion we may appoſitely explain what degree of allowablenes mercenary love may be accepted at; for as baſe money is a meanes of commerce between the rich and the poore, and is not commonly allowed in payments, above ſome low ſumme: ſo God in condeſcendence to the poverty and incommodity of our nature permitteth mercenary love in
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:115212:115"/>
ſome proportion to be currant, between his plenty and our penury, but will not accept our totall diſcharge in it, we may have ſome ſelfe-reſpect in our affections to God, that may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to us our rewards, as a beneficiall traffique and corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence; but if we aſſigne all our love too partially to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of our private bleſſings, we are in danger of loſing hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, by trading only for it; by reaſon this kind of love ſeemeth to treat with God only, as he is in heaven, not to affect hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as it is in God; and ſo we may faile of both, by this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placing of them in our deſire; they who ſeeke God firſt, are ſure to find heaven with him, but they who looke at heaven on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, are not ſo ſure to find God: for in this Court the very aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the Kings favour is the acquiring it; and we know the having grace and credit is a better ſecurity for the making of benefit, then the affecting of gaine, is an addreſſe to the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of favour.</p>
               <p>This conſidered, we muſt be adviſed, not to reckon too much upon this baſer ſpecies of mercenary love, for though it be admitted for ſome part of our account, it will not be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the whole ſumme of our purchaſe, it muſt be <hi>the gold tryed in fire</hi> which the Angell adviſeth us to provide, that muſt <note place="margin">Rev. 3. 18.</note> make the greateſt part of the price of that precious Pearle for which we traffique: and this is <hi>filiall love,</hi> even as pure as wee can refine it, in this our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But in our degenerated nature, <hi>mercenary love</hi> ſeemeth to be the Elder Brother, yet as it is the ſonne of the Bond-woman, ſo is it not the heire of the bleſſing; though God doth heare the voice of this <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and aſſignes ſome allowance to it, yet he ſettleth not <hi>the Covenant</hi> upon it: <hi>Filiall Love</hi> is our <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the iſſue of a free ingenuous Soule, the ſpouſe of God, and of that ſtock, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>is born in our hearts,</hi> and the chiefe bleſſings of chriſtianity are entailed upon this ſeed of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Filiall Love.</p>

               <p>When our hearts do ſincerely aime and point at this ſtraight <hi>filiall love,</hi> God, like a tender father, doth rather compaſſionate then reproach the wrineſſe and indirectneſs of our paces, in this feeblenes of our feet, when our hearts are ſet ſtraight in this way of our loving him, as we ſee fathers deale with little children, which they call to them when they beginne to try to go alone, when they ſee them croſſe their feet, and reele forward in their weake faltering motions, ſometimes falling by the way, they. do rather cheriſh them then chide them for this imbecility: ſo God, when he ſeeth the heart ſtraining forward, with the beſt of our powers, towards a ſimple immediate love of him,

                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:115212:118"/>
Methinks the dignity and preſent delight of this noble love (though it were an unthrift anticipation in this our minority, and were to be diſcounted to us out of our future eſtate of loving) might tempt a ſoule to take up for her preſent joy and ſatisfaction, the ſuavity and bleſſedneſſe of this excellent love: how much the rather ought we then aſpire to this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of loving, when the eſtate of our reverſion is reproved proportionately to the degrees of this our anticipation? This may well be the Method of ſuch a father, whoſe portions to his heires, are the injoying himſelfe; no wonder then, that the deſire to preoccupate this ſtate, ſhould augment the childrens inheritance: For the Father (who is infinite love,) muſt needs be largeſt to them who have advanced to themſelves the moſt of <hi>Filiall love:</hi> and the reaſon is, that this Celeſtiall Father can reward nothing but his own gifts, aſſigning alwayes ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond benefits, by the meaſures of his firſt liberality: and thus the more he hath inriched us with this love, the more he remu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerateth the poſſeſſion of it; ſo that <hi>mercenary love</hi> when it is underſtood, will be found to damnifie it ſelfe, by this projected aeconomy of ſelfe-proviſion: for in this commerce, all pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate reference imbaſeth ſo much the ſpecies wherewith we negotiate, as it falles in value, juſt as much as it riſeth in quantity.</p>
               <p>When we reflect upon the ſtate of humane nature, we may collect eaſily, how much God deſireth this correſpondence of <hi>Filiall love,</hi> ſince even from the forfeiture of all our filiall dignity, he tooke the riſe of a nearer and firmer alliance of our nature unto his, and faſtned it ſo to this filial conſtitution, as he took it out of mans own power, ever to divide or ſever it againe from this relation; for even the ſinne of man can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver divorce our humanity now from this filiall ſtate, ſince the naturall Sonne of God, will now no more ceaſe to be man, then to be God, ſo inſeparably is our nature now fixed in this filiall reference; for though individuals may by want of <hi>Filial love</hi> to the divine nature) ſeparate themſelves from a bleſſed participation thereof in eternity, yet our nature can never fall
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:115212:118"/>
from this divine conjunction, but ſhall remaine elevated above that of <hi>Cherubims</hi> and <hi>Seraphins</hi> to all eternity.</p>
               <p>O who can contemplate this, and conſent to love God, leſſe nobly then our preſent nature will admit, conſidering we have even the nobleneſſe of our nature, now ſet out to us as an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our love! for as it is in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> we cannot over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love our own humanity: and ſince God hath done as much as was poſſible for him in honour of our nature, ſhall man be content to love this God, leſſe then is poſſible for his conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution? nay there are grave Divines, who indeare this obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon our humanity by this ſuppoſition, that God loſt the love of much nobler creatures, by his preference of mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture before theirs; and if the ſupreameſt of all creatures, thought this as a partiality to an unworthy ſubject, a provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to leave loving of God; ſhall not this prefer'd creature derive from hence a powerfull motive to raiſe and purifie his love, in reſpect of this ſo obliged propoſure; whereof the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle</hi> glorieth, and inſiſteth much upon the prelation of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> before the nature of <hi>Angels,</hi> as one of the ſtrongeſt inducements, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And ſince God hath prefer'd the nature of man, before that of <hi>Angels,</hi> not onely in point of honour, but likewiſe in the part of ſuccour; why may we not ſuppoſe he valueth more the love of men, then that of <hi>Angels?</hi> this conception may ſafely be made uſe of, to incite us to the ſtudying the abſtraction and ſpiritualizing our loves, to the pureſt degree of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound nature; in which (the very diſadvantage we have more then pure ſpirits in the deveſture of ſelf-reſpects) may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into a conducement to the value of our purity, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the oppoſition of our bodyes in this diſintereſted love, is counted to us an indearement of our hearts, when in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy of one halfe, we reduce our love to that decree of implicity which is compatible with this our complexure; and as Saint <hi>Jerome</hi> ſaith of the chaſtity of virgins compoſed with that of <hi>Angels, There is more felicity in the one, but more
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:115212:119"/>
fortitude in the other:</hi> So we may ſay reſpectively of their two loves, that there is more happyneſſe in the one, but more He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roickneſſe in the other.</p>
               <p>What Angelicall love exceedeth in the fineneſſe of abſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, humane may anſwer in the fidelity of extraction, ſince his is laboured and formed out of repugnant matter; for man muſt overcome, what Angels have not to reſiſt, many mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall adherencies incorporate in his ſenſes, inſomuch as the ſonnes of men for the purifying their affections, muſt (as it were) ceaſe to be themſelves, and theſe ſpirituall ſubſtances for the ſimplifying of their loves, need but reſt and remaine themſelves.</p>
               <p>Wherefore in this ods of natures, in this act of loving, the difficulty on mans part paſſeth as an allowance of ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity in point of fineneſſe and ſeparateneſſe; and taking our loves with this allowance, they may be thought as currant with God, as thoſe abſtracted affections facilitated by a more ſimple nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that when man ſigheth, (as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith) as burthened with inviſcerate intereſts, longing to put on this pure ſpirituall veſture of <hi>Filiall love,</hi> this kind of heavineſſe of ſpirit, may be ſaid to make his love weight in heaven; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the eaſieſt way to lighten this kind of burthen of ſelfe-reſpect, is to ſigh it away by degrees; for nothing looſeneth and bloweth off more this duſt about our hearts, then theſe breathings and aſpirations of the ſoule in a reſentment of thoſe impure mixtures, the body infuſeth into her love to God; ſo that we are, as I may ſay, allowed what our nature aboundeth the moſt in, which is ſorrow, to make up that wherein our love is the moſt defective, which is ſimplicity and immixture; ſince a pure and ſincere ſorrow, for the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and impurity of our affections to this indulgent Father, is accepted as a compenſation for the defect of pure and <hi>Filial love.</hi>

               <p>This indulgent diſpenſion with our defective love, floweth from that gratious relation of friends to the Son of God: which dignity ſeemeth ſo firmly inſtated in our nature, as the conferrer of it did not degrade, even <hi>Judas,</hi> after the forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <note place="margin">Matt. 26. 50.</note> thereof, he was received with the title of <hi>friend,</hi> when he came to renounce all his rights to that conceſſion, it ſeemeth he was yet in a capacity of being reſtored, if he would but have pleaded by love and ſorrow for his reſtauration, he might have ſold God, and yet have injoyed him, if he would but have loved him after he had ſold him; had he inſtead of caſting the price of his diſpaire, into the materiall temple, brought but back his faith and his love to the living temple, caſting himſelfe forward at his feet, as a counterfall to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his falling backward when he fell from them, had he then with penitent kiſſes repai'd unto <hi>Chriſts</hi> feet, beſought the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off that perfidious impudence which ſtuck upon his lips, we may well believe <hi>Chriſt</hi> would have received him in this returne, with <hi>Friend thou art welcome,</hi> comming with theſe
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:115212:120"/>
kiſſes to ſigne the Sonne of man's being the Sonne of God, and it is very probable he would then have equalized the good theef.</p>
               <p>O what cannot love obtaine of him who loved us ſo much, as he ſeemed not to love himſelfe in the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it? Let us then copy this love, as well as our diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions allow us, and aſpire to ſuch a dilection of him, as may ſeeme a deſertion, and even an exinanition of our ſelves, which were as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, the degrees of his love to us; <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 7.</note> and in this our imitation of his love, we have a ſtrange ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of him; for he was faine to take upon him the forme of a ſervant, to expreſſe his exceſſive charity, and we put on a divine ſimilitude in this our exhibition of pure diſintereſted love to him; for we manifeſt our partaking of the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in this denudation of our own, when our love is refined and purged from mercenary reſpects.</p>
               <p>And when we penetrate into the divine nature, we perceive that we are ſo farre from loſing any thing by this ſelf-poſt-po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as we loſe even no time in point of our remuneration: For there is no interim between our loves looking on God for himſelfe, and the ſeeing our intereſts in God, ſince in the ſame inſtant, our loves look directly upward upon this mirour of the Deity, it reflecteth to us our own bleſſedneſſe, and the leſſe we looked for our ſelves, the more we then ſee of them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplendent in that clarity.</p>
               <p>This Celeſtiall mirrour, maketh a reflection much differing from all materiall ones, for it doth not ſend back to us the ſame image we ſet before it, but a farre better then we had any capacity to expoſe unto it: for when our love looketh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, refer'd ſimply to his own eſſentiall purity: This ſort of mirrour returneth to us not ſo much the image of our loves to God, as the repreſentation of Gods love to us, by reaſon we ſee then God loving us, in this our intuition of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: which reflection ſheweth us a better character of this manner of our love, then we could have prefigured to our ſelves; and when we behold our ſelves in that image of Gods

loving us, we cannot overvalue our ſelves under that notion, ſo that this is a bleſſed and a ſafe courſe, joyntly to pleaſe God, and humour our own nature in a ſelfe-complacency.</p>
               <p>Thus have I endeavoured to figure theſe two loves, and I have ſet them both in the tabernacle, but in unequall ranks of dignity, the one without, among the utentſils of braſſe, the other within the vail, among the inſtruments of gold: ſo as the moſt ignoble of theſe two ſpecies, is allowed in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of religion in ſome degree, but is not accepted ſingle, as ſufficient for our religious oblation: For God tollerateth no longer the infirmity of that love, whereof we our ſelves diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence with the inſufficiency, ſo that the relying upon <hi>mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry love,</hi> may decry it, while our diſclaiming the meanneſſe of it, may hold it up current with him, to whom King <hi>David</hi> pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pureſt ſpecies, ſaid, <hi>Thou art my God, and ſtandeſt i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

raiſe and re-mount it to this elevation; and our ſpirits muſt continually attend this operation of Grace, to force up this pure affection againſt the riſings of our ſenſitive appetites, which make ſteepe oppoſitions to this reflux; inſomuch as if this worke be not aſſiduouſly intended, our affections quickly ſinke into the channell of our earthy nature, which is intereſted and mercenary love.</p>
               <p>They who pretend to keepe their hearts exalted, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaith, above the altitudes of the earth, in this purer ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>filiall love,</hi> muſt watch it continually, when they hope they have it, and ſtill pray for it as if they feared they had it not: and there is no ſo ill ſign of our having any of it, as our preſuming we have enough of it; as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith of the knowledge of God, that he who hath ſpeculated his nature never ſo long, when he commeth to think he hath found a compleat definition of God, may be then ſaid to underſtand the leaſt of him: So may I ſay of <hi>Filiall love,</hi> they who have been never ſo long filling their heatrs with it, when they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume they are full enough, are then the moſt devoyded of it: It is in our love, (referring to the immenſity of God) as in numbers relating to infinity, wherein any ſumme never ſo great, when it is once caſt up and ſtai'd in any total, may be ſaid to be further from infinity then a much leſſer number, which is ſtill running on without any determined period: So any degree of love to our Creator, being once voluntarily bounded and circumſcribed, is farther off from our intermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate duty of loving, then an affection never ſo much behind, that is ſtill advancing without a purpoſe of terme or limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>This then may be an infallible note of the deficiency of our love, when in any ſtraine of interior fervor, we conclude we may ſtay our loves at ſuch a pitch, and make plaines upon it, never aiming at a higher flight, and this may be a ſecure reſt for ſuch hearts, as are yet never ſo infirme in their loves, that as long as they purſue ſincerely the premotion and advance of them, loving all they can, and reſolving never to love leſſe
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:115212:122"/>

               <p>What greater incentive can we wiſh for the purifying our love, then to conceive that capacity to be granted to our love on earth, which is denyed to our underſtanding even in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to wit, the full comprehenſion of God? but there is no love unleſſe perfect filiall, that can beare this ſo large aſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For our mercenary affection may be ſaid to look upon divinity but as an object angular, onely as it pointeth unto our ſelves, and doth not ſpread out ſouls upon the ſpherical and circular form of the divine goodneſſe, as it is it ſelfe, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing all forms and beings, which latitude and expanſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is peculiar unto <hi>Filiall love,</hi> as an operation of that all-compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing charity, diffuſed in our hearts by the <hi>holy-Ghoſt:</hi> For all <note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> our love to God is inſpired by himſelf, as the light inlightning, maketh the light that is illuminated.</p>
               <p>God hath provided ſo kindly againſt our miſtaking of our way to this excellent love, as he hath ſet us a ſenſible mark to guide us by, which is fraternall love, which we have as a kind of viſible object, whereby to direct our courſe; ſo that if our love loſe ſight of this mark, we may be ſure it is out of the way to filiall affection, for the beloved <hi>Apoſtle</hi> (in purſuit of his <note place="margin">1 Ep.

become as it were a minoir that reflected to him the figure of Death in his own face: How came it then to paſs, that this paſſion of Revenge (which is likely the ſtrongeſt at the firſt ſtraining, all paſſions being now ſo newly broken looſe in the minde of <hi>Adam)</hi> did not declare ſome violent reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this provocation, and fall into an averſion againſt his Temptreſs? Sure it was, that he (who had ſtill ſo clear a light of his own Nature left ſhining in him) diſcerned the Image of God remaining ſtill upon her; which object he ſaw deſerved love and affection.</p>
               <p>This character, as it was not efaced by this occaſion (which was the ſeed of all injuries that have ſprung up ever ſince) ſo it remaineth ſtill indelible in all Humane enemies: And as no iniquity can expunge that Image, ſo is there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways left that object for our love in Humane Nature, even when it is the worſt disfigured to us by any demerit of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals to our particular: Unto this character is that love referred, which is by command aſſigned to our private ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, whom we are not ordained to love under the notion of haters of us, nor to bleſs in relation to their curſing us, for this were to propoſe that for the object of our love, to which God cannot be reconciled, as Evil and Viciouſneſs; not could out Maſter and Law-giver love any, becauſe they hated him: we may rather ſay, That becauſe he did not love to be hated, he came even from Heaven to make friends of his enemies, that were capable of this Converſion, and ſhewed no love even unto Angels, in reſpect of the inflex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ibleneſs of their Nature, after their declared enmity; but we can have no irreconcileable enemies, ſince Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not invariable after judgement, like Angelical.</p>
               <p>Therefore all our Charity commanded for enemies, is in order to the working on them, by differing impreſſions, being deſigned to rectifie their enormity, not to confirm their crookedneſs; for we are not obliged to any offices towards enemies, that are likely to continue and foment their pravity or malevolence. After our ſincere and cordial forgiveneſs, all the aſſiſtance we are bound conſtantly to render them,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:115212:129"/>
is Spiritual, in fervent and devout interceſſions to God for their recipiſcence and reſtitution to his Grace. Temporal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits are preciſely due to them onely in caſes of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme neceſſities, and in ſuch proportions as riſe not to the enabling them for thoſe ill effects we may juſtly apprehend from their ability, what falls within our ordained duty, is, The not excluding them in any publike diſtribution of our benificences, in relation to our private diſcords, and the keeping our mindes diſpoſed to ſuccour and accommodate their particular diſtreſſes, in caſe of their occurring and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting themſelves to our charity.</p>
               <p>This is the term our Charity is poſitively commanded to reach unto, what it exceedeth this point is a free-will-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which paſſeth forward from the precept towards the perfection of Piety; ſo that the poſitive exaction in this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, can ſeem ſevere onely to ſuch as are pinched with any of the ſtraight orders of Chriſtian Religion; for all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior offices of obligation, reſpect onely the neceſſities of enemies, which our Nature hath no averſion to look upon, and it muſt be a very perverſe temper that muſt not be moved to Charity by the ſtate of ſuperiority over an enemy; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, all our Supplies and Miniſteries, both Spiritual and Temporal, are directed by God towards the converſion of our enemies into friends; and in that reſpect we ſeem alow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a proſpect of ſome preſent intereſt in all our offices, for the coals we are to intend the heaping on the heads of our adverſaries by our benevolences, are ſuch as are kindled in our own hearts, of Fraternal Charity; they are not to be propoſed as fuel to Gods fiery indignation againſt them, as is familiarly miſconceived by many <hi>ſemi-Chriſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When we ponder then (even but rationally) this duty, we ſhall finde it lighten in our hands the more we weigh it; for what is commonly ſaid of Death, ſorteth well with this precept, <hi>viz.</hi> That is looketh horridly at the firſt aſpect, but the longer it is looked upon, the leſs formidable it groweth, and by degrees it becometh familiar and unoffenſive to our minde.

in the firſt aboard of it to our vicious Nature: the diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and acquaintance with it openeth to us the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, by which we are eaſily reconciled to our firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the ſevere countenance of this commandment; and when we behold it in the form reflected from the light of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſee themſelves <hi>fellow members of one body:</hi> In which reſpect the reſentment of offences may ſeem as unnatural, as our hating a wounded part of our body, becauſe it paineth and diſtempereth the other: Doth any body project a revenge againſt his feet, for having ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and faln and hurt his face? All wrongs and injuries done to one another, are (in the conſtitution of Chriſtianity) but the failings and defects of one portion of the body, whereby another is prejudiced.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THe miſapprehenſion of the Nature of Love ſeemeth a great occaſion of our mindes being ſo aliened from the love of enemies; pleaſing objects do common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrain our affections into ſuch exceſſes, as we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten know no love, but under the notion of a diſtemper in the concupiſcing faculty; and while our affections are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to this inordinateneſs, we can hardly comprehend how love ſhould be compatible with diſpleaſures and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarieties: So that the perverſion of our amities, induceth this alienation from our enemies: Could we then hold love from ſtraining into paſſion, we might eaſily ſtay anger from paſſing into ſin, as is evidenced by the lives of all thoſe who have diſcarded the pleaſures of this age, whom we ſee keep in their hands ſo contentedly the injuries and offences thereof: We finde it verified in ſuch eſtates, the growing po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent when they are infirm, and the imitation of receiving <hi>Judas</hi> with, <hi>Friend, why art thou come?</hi> they who are paſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing betrayed by the worlds kiſſes, are beyond the being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered by the ſpittings of his miniſters: But that even thoſe, who are not called to this upper ſtory of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, may not miſtake the nature of this love aſſigned to ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies by the image of that love they figure due to friends, they may be ſatisfied, That we are not enjoyned the ſame

ſtate and compoſure of minde to the adverſaries and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, as to the friends and allies of our Nature.</p>
               <p>There is a certain inviſcerate tenderneſs of affection, growing in our hearts for children and kindred, which is a kinde of ſpring of natural love, riſing in our mindes, and running from thence in our blood, through our ſenſes, and carrying with it a ſenſible joy and delectation in ſuch affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: This ſort of love is not ordained to be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to enemies; and there is an intimacy and union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween friends, reſulting from an intercourſe of mutual ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy, which raiſeth a pleaſant alteration in the ſenſitive appetite, referring to ſuch correſpondencies: Theſe ſorts of conſonancies and kindeneſs, are not aſſigned by God to the perſons of our enemies and maligners; this conſtraint is not put upon our Nature: To finde a refreſhing air in the furnace of <hi>Babylon,</hi> is a tranſcendent grace, and rarely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred <note place="margin">Dan. 1.</note> but upon ſuch as have been polluted with the meats of the Kings Table: Thoſe who from their youth have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reliſhed the vain pleaſures and honors of the world, may be gratified with this ſpecial benediction, of being tenderly affected to the perſons of enemies, and the being ſolicitous to ſerve them, in conformity to the perfection of our patern, our Savior <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But our preciſe obligation reacheth no farther, then a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and cordial remiſſion and forgiveneſs of all our offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors; never ſeeking the leaſt indirect retaliation upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, fame or fortunes of our enemies. Upon the defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency in theſe points, is our Saviors judgement denounced in <note place="margin">Mat. 18. 32.</note> the Parable, of our being delivered over to the Tormentors, in caſe every one forgive not his brother from his heart; and in point of benefiting of enemies, the diſpoſition is onely exacted, in order to their extreme neceſſities; ſo that a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate conſideration of the terms of this Duty, will eaſily reſolve with the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> of love, <hi>That even this command</hi>

               </p>
               <p>We muſt remember then, that this order doth not allow
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:115212:133"/>
the common ſhift of the world, which is, The raking up our paſſion in the aſhes of civil prudence, where malice is ſtill kept alive, though it neither blaze nor ſmoke, to the perce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of others: This allowance would make this precept the eaſieſt to be obſerved, where it ſeemeth now the moſt incompetent; namely, in courts where hatred, as well as <note place="margin">Luke 22.</note> many other mean things, is uſually dreſſed up in ſo fine clothes, with ſo much art and diſſimulation, as it looketh familiarly liker all things, then what it is.</p>
               <p>This diſguiſe is the more criminal, as it ſeemeth to make even God of the party, by putting out his colours of love and ſincerity, when all the exterior civilities and correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies are but ſet out as falſe flags, by which the enemy may be boarded with the more ſafety: for here the acts of enmity are commonly ſuſpended, not ſo much out of fear of Gods prohibition, as of his defeature of the ſucceſs, which is <hi>Judas</hi>'s art, this watching an opportunity that the people might not ſpoil his bargain; and ſo the attempt of revenge is but deferred by many, till it ſeem ſure to the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the fleſh, which <hi>we know is an enemy to God:</hi> In this ſort <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> Gods enemy ſhroudeth himſelf under his wings, while ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice remaineth masked with ſociable civility; but indeed this diſſimulation is ſo mean and irreligious a thing, as it may be ſaid to brave God, and to fear Man: And having brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it with this infamous Character, I hope I ſhall not need preſs any farther the deteſtation of this counterfeit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity.</p>
               <p>There may be ſo great advantage made of enemies, as certainly no ill-willer would act his malice upon one from whom he expected but a return of love: For the ſcope and aim of all violence and miſchief, is the pain and reſentment of the patient; ſo that did we believe our harms deſigned would prove ſatisfaction inſtead of ſorrow, malice would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver alow the maligned party this gain upon her; Envy would never ſet up her frames, if ſhe thought that ſhe did but weave her Rivals Nuptial garment: Chriſtian Charity maketh this
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:115212:133"/>
converſion of the works of her enemies, ſhe cloatheth and adorneth her ſelf by the ſame hands that invade her.</p>
               <p>Therefore we ſee moſt commonly, that they are ſuch as are little skill'd in the nature of Charity, that offer injuries and ſtudies revenges; and it muſt needs be, upon their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting ſuch a temper of grieving and vexation in their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, as they finde in themſelves, otherwiſe they could not aſſail an enemy whom they conceived they ſhould fortiſie by their attempt: But true Chriſtian Charity hath this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent property, unknown to ſuch ſtrangers, and ſo impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth by her invaders by this unexpected capacity; for there may be truly affirmed much more of the vertue of Charity, then was fained of the eſtate of <hi>Antheus,</hi> who was ſaid to raiſe new ſtrength from his fall, but this was onely after his being overcome; he had been more invincible then <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> if he had doubled his forces by the gripes and compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of his Adverſary; and this is the Prerogative of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> which therefore is inſuperable by all violences, becauſe ſhe deriveth freſh vigor, even from the preſſures of the hands that impugn her: In order to this, I have ſeen <hi>Charity</hi> paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with her hand upon a <hi>Compaſs,</hi> and this <hi>Motto, While I am preſs'd, I am inlarged,</hi> which aptly expreſſeth her true nature, and informeth us, That if we do not finde this open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and dilatation of ours, upon the preſſures of enemies, we ſhould reſort to <hi>Chriſt</hi> with this ſute of his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> upon this ſame occaſion, <hi>Lord, increaſe our Faith:</hi> This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt ſincerely purſued in all our provocations, is always <note place="margin">Luke 17. 5.</note> anſwered with this grant Saint <hi>Paul</hi> proclaimeth, of <hi>glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our probation,</hi> as it produceth hope, which is <hi>not to be confounded, becauſe the Charity of God is poured forth</hi>

                  <hi>in our hearts by the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> and this infuſed love can be teſted at nothing more approving, then Enemies and Perſecuters: for true <hi>Charity</hi> muſt not onely have the clarity of Chriſtal, but the ſolidity of Gold, it muſt not onely be lucid and ſhining in good Works, and firm, until ſome Violence ſtrike upon it, but it

               <p>This ſort of Charity, hammered by the hands of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and refined in the ardors of perſecution, is that fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryed gold, which the <hi>faithful and true Witneſs counſelleth us</hi>

                  <p>The beſt preparatory diſpoſition for the acting this Duty, which maketh no oppoſition to the courſe of Juſtice; as alſo powerful perſons ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed of their temptation in the point of Revenge, and animated by their exceeding merit in this fidelity.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SInce it ſeemeth ſo unſafe, to preſume upon the interior habit of this conformity before an actual probation, this queſtion may well be made, What is the beſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratoty diſpoſition, in order to the compliance with this precept, in all emergencies and occurrences of Injuries? Whereunto I anſwer, <hi>The habit of ſincere Humility,</hi> a vertue every one lays claim to, but moſt do it upon evidence which they forge themſelves; ſo as commonly, when the poſſeſſion thereof cometh to be queſtioned before God, it indureth not the tryal; In this caſe, we cannot recuſe our Enemies for our Jury, ſince they are more proper then indifferent perſons for this tryal, which is to be judged upon the teſtimonies of our humble and patient ſufferings; few will proteſt againſt flexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs, under the depreſſion of Gods hands, but moſt would fain hold the ſcrew themſelves, whereby they are let down, for fear of falling too violently or too low; but true Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity abandoneth it ſelf to the ſupreme hand, under which all other move but inſtrumentally, not excepting againſt any violent motions of ſecondary hands, whereinto it is delivered to be exer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iſed.</p>
               <p>And if upon the pain we feel from our Enemies hand, we would with the eye of Humility look ſtrictly inward upon
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:115212:135"/>
our ſelves, we ſhould for the moſt part diſcern, that it is dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſome defect we apprehended not before, as either the cancer of Self-love, which we have all in our breaſts, or ſome tumor riſing in Proſperity, or the Ulcer of Senſuality, or the vertigo and giddineſs of youth, or the drowſineſs and tepidity of Eaſe and Accommodation; All which may be ſaid to be like worms to Ships, that breed in us, eating and conſuming us under water moſt, when we lie ſtill in the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors of temporal reſt and ſecurity; ſo that perfect Humility, underſtanding the unſoundneſs of Humane Nature, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth Enemies as Gods Surgeons, making all their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, rather Cures of ſome Infirmity, then woundings of any vertuous quality.</p>
               <p>I may then ſafely propoſe to you the ſtudy of Humility, as the beſt qualification for the diſcharge of this precept, <note place="margin">Matt. 11.</note> ſince he who commandeth us to <hi>take this yoke upon us,</hi> biddeth us, <hi>learn of him to carry it,</hi> becauſe <hi>he is meek and humble of heart;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 3.</note> therefore by the ſame diſpoſition we muſt needs be the beſt enabled in his method, <hi>to fulfil all righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor doth this precept, of Loving enemies, and Forgiving offences, any way ſlack or retard the exerciſe of Juſtice, whoſe ſword, though it draw blood, yet it ſheddeth none, for it ſtriketh onely in application to Gods order, not mans paſſion; Princes therefore (who are but Gods ſword-bearers by the right of their offices, when they are provoked by any perſonal injury, as Ingratitude, or any other infidelity not le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally criminal) ſhould remember, That though they have many other arms about them, yet they are warranted to ſtrike with none but the ſword of Juſtice.</p>
               <p>Revenge is juſtice that Nature would do her ſelf, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that power which hath the command of regular Juſtice, may eaſily be deceived by our Nature, which (when it is checked by the Law of God in this point of ſelf-righting) ſeeketh to ſlip in this appetite, under the cover of the Law of Man: Thus the animoſity which powerful perſons have in their hearts, eaſily runs through their veins into their
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:115212:135"/>
hands, which hold and deliver out the publike Juſtice; into which private intereſts do ſo commodiouſly inſinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as it requireth a great attention of grace to diſcern this ſurreption, and reject this intruſion of Revenge into the train and comitancy of Juſtice.</p>
               <p>Me thinks Princes, not being expoſed ſo much as others to perſonal irritations, have it diſcounted to them in the equal impoſition of this duty on them, of <hi>Forgiving private offences,</hi> and repreſſing the ſence of particular diſpleaſures; ſince this Bridle muſt needs ſet the moſt uneaſily upon their heads, the Crown ſeeming to take up ſo much room, as there is little left for the reins of this Command: In others, the violence of their Nature is often eaſily ſtaid and repulſed by the ſteepneſs of the riſe up to Revenge, but they are put to hold it preſſing downhil, ſo that unleſs Grace bear the reins very hard, Nature will eaſily run away in this precipitate paſſion; but as this difficulty maketh the reſtraint of this <hi>impetus</hi> the more painful, ſo the maſtery thereof becometh more meritorious to them, then it is to leſs tempted Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts.</p>
               <p>Certainly Princes who faithfully obſerve this command, make more of their provocations then they do of moſt of their bounties; for by this ſubjection, they lay up their power in Heaven, in ſtead of laying it out on Earth: and at that day when all the Treaſures of their Civil Liberalities ſhall be melted and diſſolved, theſe their Sufferings and Self denials ſhall remain impaſſible, in <hi>that fire,</hi> which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, <hi>ſhall try all our works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Bleſſed then are onely thoſe, who while they live here in greatneſs and authority, build their Monuments of ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials as may endure the fire of that day, when even the light affections of this life ſhall prove hay and ſtubble about their owners, paſſing through a flame, and the heavy paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Anger and Malice ſhall ſink their bearers into ſuch flames as are never to be paſſed.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the beſt Monuments Princes can erect for
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:115212:136"/>
their eternity, are arches of theſe ſolid Vertues, of Humility, Patience and Charity, which are the more ſtrengthned, the more they are charged with the remiſſion of injuries, and the dilection of enemies: Theſe will out laſt all their <hi>Pyramides</hi> of ſecular Oſtentation and Magnificence, the King of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven &amp; Earth hath left them the model of this arch in his life, who was then in the ſtrongeſt point of his Oharity, when he was bowed into this triumphant arch of Humility, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Croſs, under which as his body ſunk, ſo his love to his enemies grew the more erected: none then can be ſo great, as to be exempted from this conformity, nor any ſo miſerable, as not be ſolaced by this aſſociation.</p>
               <p>I may well then caſt up all my diviſions, reſpecting ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral conditions, and different provocations, into this total, That whoſoever confeſs they have any ſins, whereof they expect a forgiveneſs from God, muſt reſolve to forgive their Brother, what offences ſoever ſhall require their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, ſince this condition is expreſly ſet upon their own pardons, <hi>If you forgive not men, neither will your Father</hi>

               <p>THere is no Argument wherein Natural Reaſon hath more need of a Supernatural prompter, to help us to frame our concluſions, then in this of the miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage and fruſtration of pious and juſt deſigns, eſpecially in publike cauſes: For God hath left us a convenient light, whereby to read the right of Cauſes, and our duties to them, which is our ſincereſt and moſt diſintereſſed Reaſon, judging by the known Laws of his Will: But to diſcern whether the Succeſs or Defeature of any Cauſe concur moſt to the univerſal end of <hi>Gods Providence,</hi> this knowledge is ſeated in unacceſſible light. We may read Gods preſent Will in Events, but not his conſequent Order, which may require the demoliſhment of many particular goods, to build up the frame of the univerſal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore the preſent ruine of ſingle pieces of Equity, doth not derogate any thing from the goodneſs of their Nature: Wherefore the right of Cauſes ought not to be ſentenced by the irregularity of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, which are always uniform to Gods univerſal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, though, diſproportioned according to the model of our Reaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="292" facs="tcp:115212:137"/>
Surely they who ſhall ſeek to penetrate the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence by the eye of Reaſon, ſo far as to make a draught of the reaſons of all particular occurrences, in the variations of Events, make ſuch an attempt, as one that ſhould gaze upon the Sun to enjoy more light, then when he looked upon the Earth: For they who preſs into this light, ſhall quickly be oppreſſed by the ſame ſplendor they deſign for illumination: And yet the infirmity of man is ſubject to ſuch a kinde of Temptation <hi>(viz.)</hi> To ſtudy even the decyphering of all Gods characters, in which his hand to the Creatures is very often ſent. For the ſucceſſes and prevalence of Injuſtice againſt Honeſty and Vertue, may be aptly termed Gods ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, in which his hand is ſoon diſcerned, but not his ſenſe: Nevertheleſs, we do familiarly take Events for the key of all the characters of Gods Providence, and preſume to read many of his Secrets very confidently by this key of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent form and figure of Events; Nay, our zeal is often ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious in this art of decyphering, as it perſwades us that we may even run and read the right of Cauſes by this light of Succeſſes.</p>
               <p>Inſomuch as S. <hi>Pauls</hi> caſe in <hi>Malta</hi> is very familiar in the world; for while the Viper is hanging upon the Cauſe, and we are looking when it ſhall fall down and periſh, then we make our Judgement to be Gods Sentence; and when the Viper is ſhaken into the fire, and that deſtroyed by us, which was expected as our deſtruction; when a cauſe recovers from this danger; then commonly that is cryed up for Gods Cauſe, which before paſſed for his Curſe. This is a familiar conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion with ſuch, who as we may ſay, know Gods Providence onely by fight, that is, by the external marks of Succeſſes, and have no acquaintance with the nature and condition<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Therefore as it is ſaid of Philoſophy, That a ſlight and ſuperficial knowledge of it, may incline the minde of man to Atheiſm; for if our minde ſtay, and reſt upon ſecond cauſes which are next to our ſenſes, this fixure of our
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:115212:137"/>
thoughts may keep our minde ſhort of the Supreme cauſe; but if we make a farther advance and progreſſion into the reaſon of Philoſophy, it will lead the minde up to Religion, as it ſhews the congruous dependency and ſubordination of all cauſes to Divine Providence: So in the firſt rudiments of Religion, which preſent us with a ſuperficial aſpect of Gods Juſtice under the notion onely of rewarding and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing: This firſt impreſſion may move us to conclude of the quality of cauſes by Gods preſent declaration in their promotion, or their prejudice; but a judicious advance into the farther grounds of Religion, will carry us to a reverent ſuſpenſe of our concluſions upon the preſent apparences of all Events, and apply us to the contemplation of Gods uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Providence, which the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> calls <hi>Gods great abyſſe;</hi> which when it is the moſt ſtormy to our Reaſon, when it drowns and deſolates in our apprehenſion the right and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of Humane actions, even then it runs in the proper courſe of univerſal Juſtice and Equity.

                  </gap>y and novelty, as rather then they would want new Religions, they would have even unknown gods; ſo as their Liberties did not onely reach to the making of new Religions, but new gods: therefore it is no wonder if their <hi>Poets</hi> were their <hi>Prieſts,</hi> which moved S. <hi>Paul</hi> to argue <note place="margin">Acts 17.</note> with them out of their Authorities. It was no wonder this people, who had a ſeveral god preſiding over every Humane action, ſhould judge the equity of all cauſes by Events; inſomuch as when S. <hi>Paul</hi> preached to them one God, and his ſingle Providence as the orderer and contriver of all productions and mutations, they thought this an abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the priviledge of their Reaſon, to be enjoyned a ſubſcription to one ſupreme Providence, without any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſatisfaction to their diſcourſe in the occurrences of this life: For when he told them, That by <hi>Gods works man could but feel out as it were by palpation in the dark</hi> the notion of the Deity, and could not expect to reade the reaſon of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration by any light, but that of Faith; this ſeemed to them babling, and talking idlely in S. <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither is it any wonder that people undetermined in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, ſhould be ſo ſuperſtitious in Succeſſes, as to make ſome Religion out of them; for where Religion hath been looſeſt, <hi>Fortune</hi> always paſſed for a Deity; and it is not ſtrange that they who worſhip Fortune, ſhould ſacrifice their Reaſon to Succeſſes, for then truly mens private Fortunes become their Religions. But where the knowledge and worſhip is reſolved and uniform, the Divine Providence is erected in ſtead of Fortunes Altar, our Reaſon is offered up
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:115212:140"/>
as an Holocauſt totally conſumed, and reſigned to this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the fat of the Sacrifice is the evacuation of all our own judgements, in the event of things which do wholly tranſcend our Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Yet do I not pretend we ſhould be wholly unmoved or unaffected with happy Succeſſes, but in ſuch caſes we ought to look upon them, as they are ſimply in themſelves mercies, not reſpectively, as we judge them ſentences in our Cauſe: for in adverſity the matter doth not declare Gods meaning, when ſomtimes it is intended to purge &amp; improve, ſomtimes determinately to puniſh us; therefore the matter of miſery may be diſliked, but not Gods meaning in it So proſperous Succeſſes are ſometimes meant as approbations, and often as derelictions to the deſires of our hearts; wherefore the matter of them may be affected, but the meaning of them not peremptorily concluded.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that as in our enemies we may hate the ſin, and not love the man the worſe, ſo in our temporal advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, we may be joyed with the ſucceſs, and yet not like the cauſe the better, which is to have an equal diſpoſition in them: For the choyce of our Cauſe muſt reſt upon that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable Centre of the right and juſtice thereof: which when by our beſt and moſt diſintereſſed Reaſon we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive fixed and ſetled, nothing that doth not better our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, can evidence more to us the goodneſs of our Cauſe: and uncertain Natural Events have not that vertue of improving our Reaſon; they may more eaſily weaken it, if we ſtudy by the lines and editions of Natural Accidents, which are ſo falſe to the nature of Moral cauſes.</p>
               <p>Man is not ſet ſo hard a task, as to work to fit all Events with ſutable Reaſons to them: It was a ſtrange exaction of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> upon his <hi>Magi,</hi> to declare to him not onely the meaning, but the very dream, as if they had been the infuſers of it. They who ſearch for Humane Reaſons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate to the events of all actions, do, me thinks, as wilde a thing; for they adventure to interpret Gods Actions
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:115212:140"/>
and Myſteries by their own Dreams, ſince our ratiocina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the ſecrets of Divine Order, is but an excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Fancy, which is of the ſame nature as a Dream in Religion.</p>
               <p>It ſeems therefore rather an indulgence to our weakneſs, then an injunction againſt our liberties, to be forbid to preſs <hi>into that light where we ſhall be oppreſſed by the majeſty of it:</hi> For, <hi>What is man</hi> (ſaith the wiſeſt of men) <hi>that he ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Maker?</hi> and when he had applyed his heart to finde out the reaſon of all things, he confeſſeth, <hi>He had counted one</hi>

                  <p>An information of what kinde of conformity we owe Gods declared Will in adverſe Events.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AFter theſe bounds ſet to curioſity, me thinks many are deſirous to know, Whether their Wills are bound up to their Adverſities. I ſhall endeavor to ſatisfie ſuch enquiries by a clear Solution of this Queſtion; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving them, That although we are reſtrained in the curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Cauſes, we are not confined to a conformity of our Wills, to the material object of Gods Will, in publike calamities and afflictions. Our Wills muſt be faſtned to Gods, in the formal object of our willing; which is, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire every thing in order to the accompliſhment of his Will, in his univerſal Ordination of all things: But we are not obliged to be pleaſed in every material declaration of Gods
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:115212:141"/>
pleaſure, as in the defeature of a good Cauſe, the death of our friends, and the ſucceſsfulneſs of our enemies. In theſe, and ſuch caſes of conforming our wills to the matter of our ſufferings, we may, as it were, diſpute the cauſe with God, and wiſh his Providence might work by other means: Becauſe in this ſhadowed light of our Reaſon wherein we live, we do not ſee how the ways lead to Gods univerſal ends, to which our wils are only bound to be conformed formality, as making that Divine Order the rule of our final deſires.</p>
               <p>We know <hi>Abraham</hi> oppoſed Gods declared Will, in the material part of it, in the deſtruction of <hi>Sodom;</hi> and when God ordained him the Sacrificing of his Son; he might juſtly have wiſhed God had been pleaſed to appoint him ſome other teſtimony of his Obedience: This kinde of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting is properly rather a velleity, or wiſhing an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods purpoſe, then an oppoſition to it; and this imperfect adhering to Gods Will, is proper to this half-light we have of it, in our diſtance from the object of his univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Order. Thoſe who in the light of his countenance look upon his Will, have theirs both materially and formally uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to it; becauſe, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſays, <hi>In thy light we ſhall ſee all light:</hi> Thus they diſcern how all they deſire is in order to the univerſal end, and underſtand how all the diſcords which are now jars in our ears, are ſet to compoſe the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Divine Providence, wherein they have their parts, ſinging continually the praiſes thereof. But while we are looking through our glaſs, and the darkneſs of our riddle, we are not obliged to a clearer conformity of our Wills, then the nature of our light can afford us, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers not to us how all preſent advers accidents are perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to the efficacity of Gods univerſal Order; therefore we are not impoſed that preciſe adherence of our Wills to the material part of adverſity.</p>
               <p>Upon this ground the <hi>Prophets</hi> preſumed as it were to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plead Gods ſentences, by an expoſtulation with him about their execution. <hi>Moſes</hi> makes a Remonſtrance to God of the
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:115212:141"/>
inconveniences of his declared Will to deſtroy <hi>Iſrael,</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the ſcandal of impotency whereunto his name would be lyable among the <hi>Heathens:</hi> and the <hi>Prophet Samuel,</hi> after the pronouncing of Gods ſentence againſt <hi>Saul,</hi> ſeems to plead for him with his tears ſo long, as God asketh him, <hi>How long he would lament Saul?</hi> not as diſpleaſed with this unconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, but rather in commiſeration of his piety, and tenderneſs of charity. The <hi>Prophet Jeremy</hi> pleaded ſo long againſt the rigor of his own commiſſion, as God imployed his modeſty to ſilence him, knowing he would not expect a grant in what <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> ſhould have bin rejected; yet when he could <note place="margin">Jer. 14.</note> intercede no longer, when his mouth was ſtopt, his eyes were let looſe into ſtreams, that ſeemed to run ſtill againſt the tide of Gods judgements. And God allowed the <hi>Prophet Jonah</hi> a <note place="margin">Jonah 4.</note> much ſtronger liberty, to ſeem angry at Gods mercy, and to diſpute the juſtneſs of his perplexity. In all theſe inſtances the wills of the <hi>Prophets</hi> were formally concurrent with the Will of God; for they made ſtill the reaſon of their willing the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of the common univerſal diſpoſition of Gods order, but we ſee they diſſented in the matter of their willing; they did not vote theſe ſpecial and preciſe means concurrent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with Gods voice, becauſe they ſaw not clearly how they ſtood in Gods deſign of the common good, and ſo might dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from God in wiſhing the order, though not the end.</p>
               <p>It is otherwiſe with the <hi>Angels</hi> who are in a fuller light, they diſcern how all Humane events are in their ſpecial order to the common benefit of the <hi>Univerſe,</hi> and ſo execute their Commiſſions of Benevolence or Indignation upon us, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any alteration of joy in our temporal bleſſings, or commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeration in their offices of deſtruction. This ſtate of equanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty we ſhall attain, when we come to ſee face to face, that Face which ſhall make us like it, by looking on it, when we ſhall ſee him as he is, in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſhall together ſee all other things as they are; until then, while we ſee him but in the ſhadow of his works, he requires of us only our conformity to his wil, as far as he hath endued our Nature with a power of apprehending
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:115212:142"/>
how his declared pleaſure hath a conſonancy with the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal good of the world: So that we have an injunction and a capacity of wiſhing always in preference of the univerſal good, before our private intereſt. And in thoſe caſes in which we are not convinced, how the ills we ſuffer conduce to that order, we may piouſly deprecate ſuch Events, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the exigencies they occaſion, and ſue to God for the reverſing of ſuch orders; in which exigencies we may ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly preſs the haſtening of Gods time, and concurrently attend his will with patience; for that is Gods time to which our Prayers have brought God, as that price was Gods price to which <hi>Abraham</hi> brought God for <hi>Sodom.</hi> This, I hope, will ſufficiently explicate the ſence of formal and material conformity to Gods Will, and ſo enlighten us in many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurities and ſcuples, which the tenderneſs of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience may caſt over us, as apprehenſions of con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               <p>By this precedent, as near as our giddy Nature will admit, we muſt ſeek to fix our mindes upon that incomprehenſible courſe of Gods Providence, which changeth all things without any mutation in it ſelf; and the nearer we come to this con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This half-ſight of the form of things, excites wonder in us, which is broken knowledge, when our underſtanding meets objects of ſtrange effects, divided from their apparent cauſes; for if we could ſee at once this chain of Providence ſet together, all events hanging linked to their final reaſons, our wonder would preſently ceaſe: As we may ſuppoſe if the <hi>Prophet Daniel</hi> had lived to ſee actually the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Viſions, while others had wondred at <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> enterpriſe upon the Monarchy of the World, and all the ſtrange occurrences that did effect that work, he would have been little moved at thoſe Events: And when curſed <hi>Antiochus</hi> deſtroy'd <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſet up Idols upon the altar of the <hi>Temple,</hi> and aboliſhed all form of true Religion; when venerable <hi>Mathathias,</hi> and the glorious <hi>Maccabees</hi> had reaſon <note place="margin">Mac. 2.</note> to rend their garments, and to be aſtoniſhed at the deſolation of Gods people, <hi>Daniel</hi> would not have been perplexed and amazed in all this confuſion, as having had a prenotion of this, and the reſt of the chain of Providence, which made the coherence of this action.</p>

In the like maner in all other prodigious Events, which coupled the ſucceſſions of the other deſigns of God upon the world, whereof <hi>Daniel</hi> had a previſion; he could not be confuſed at that, whereat others (who looked but upon the broken pieces of the chain) were juſtly aſtoniſhed: But if <hi>Daniel</hi> had ſurvived the iſſues of all his Revelations, and had come to thoſe Times of which he was deſirous to know the ſequences and determinations, and was refuſed that illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and told, <hi>They were ſealed Myſteries, and not to be opened</hi>

               <p>Some ſatisfactory reſt may be derived from the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and acquaintance with ſuch caſes, but ſtill the reaſon of that order (which is ſo prepoſterous to our conceptions) will remain in the ſmoke of the <hi>Temple,</hi> wherein we may ſee <note place="margin">Apoc. 15.</note> God is preſent, but not how he worketh in it: The order of Gods adminiſtration reſts in the <hi>Temple</hi> deſcribed in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi> which is <hi>filled with ſmoke from the Majeſty of God, and none can enter into it until all be conſumnate.</hi>

This is the caſe of St. <hi>Lewis</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> a perſon ſo holy, as if the moſt ſanctified voyces of his Time had been to elect a King, they would probably have choſen him: This great and holy King ſtarning with the zeal of repoſſeſſing <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of the

               <p>This was the unhappy Event, according to the ſtile of the world, which that pious King, and unqueſtionable Cauſe; left the world to opine upon; of which we cannot give a better vote, then he himſelf did in his ſickneſs out of the Wiſe-mans mouth, <hi>Who can conceive the ways of God, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>There is a far different ſuperſtition in the pertinacy of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and the facility of ſome people; for they in a ſhower of Miracles falling down upon them, to anounce to them the time of the change of their Law, ſtill called for a Sign from Heaven to authorize that Doctrine; and ſome people are ſo prone to change their Law, as they call Natural Accidents, that favor their diſpoſitions, Signs from Heaven to warrant their innovations. As the firſt were ſaid to have eyes, and not to ſee, ſo theſe laſt may be ſaid to ſee without eyes; for their imaginations ſeem to them ſo illuminate, as the eye of their Reaſon is dazled when it looks againſt them: Such fancies commonly love to caſt in troubled waters, and upon all ſucceſsful draughts, they do (as the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſaith of them) <note place="margin">Habac. 2.</note>

               <p>They who are emboldened by the advantages, or abaſhed meerly by the miſcarriage of a Cauſe of which they have reaſon to believe God to be the conducter, do as if the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould have thought God had been more in the Pillar of Fire, then in the Cloud, becauſe it was a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanter object: The true children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the ſons of <hi>Faith,</hi> follow the Cloud of Gods Judgements, as confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently as the Flames of his manifeſt Kindeneſs, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure not at the waters of Contradiction, which they are often put to drink in this peregrination.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſays elegantly; That every one would be content to overtake <hi>Chriſt</hi> at his home, but few are conſtant in following him in the way; there is a contrary inordinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

in our Nature in the point of Gods Providence, for moſt are curious to follow with their ratiocinations the traces and ſteps of it upon Earth, and few are content to be tranſported immediately to the home thereof, which is Heaven; that is, we commonly affect an enquiry into the Reaſons of ſecond Cauſes, and are buſie in gueſſing at Gods meaning by them, rather then reſort directly to the inſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table order of Gods Providence in all Events, and ſo reſt upon the faithful reſciance of his Reaſons: This courſe is the overtaking of Gods Providence at home, and not the tracking it curiouſly abroad, in the prints and traces thereof as it paſſeth through the world.</p>
               <p>This laſt ought to be the courſe of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> to whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath left his Faith in the equity of Gods uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Providence, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith of his other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, <hi>That we may not be like Children, toſſed to and fro</hi> with every kinde of Fortune, by which our great Enemy, the Prince of the Ayr, raiſeth continually change of winds, to toſs us, and carry us away into an opinion of that airy Deity of <hi>Fortune,</hi> which he hath ſet up for the Devotion of the worlds Fancy.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The moſt uſeful order in deſcribing the nature of Solitude.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>MAny who have made Images of <hi>Solitude,</hi> have done like <hi>Painters</hi> when they draw <hi>Ladies;</hi> who (obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the moſt remarkable Features, as much as may make a reſemblance) cover the defects of the complexion with all the Art they can; they ſet no freckles, or mark, nor pits, or unevenneſſes in the skin, accounting the beſt prizure of their Art, to leave the favor of the perſon on the figure, with the leaſt touches of disfavor upon it: In report to this method, many who have figured <hi>Solitude,</hi> having ſet out the moſt noted properties thereof, have ſought to ſweeten all they could the diſagreeableneſs, leaving no roughneſs or inequality upon the countenance of their Character of <hi>Solitude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But thoſe who look upon it by the life, will finde much more unſmoothneſs and hard favor in it, then is expreſt in ſuch ſpeculative Images: For the original Malady of our Nature was ſuch, as hath left ſome dints and prints in the ſurface of the evenneſt ſtate of our mindes; there are harſh and unpleaſant intervals of roughneſs, and inequality found in all the faireſt complexions of our peace and ſerenity: Wherefore it concerneth us to poſſeſs our opinion with the
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:115212:149"/>
moſt natural Image of <hi>Solitude</hi> we can pourtraict, and that rather rudely touched, then flattered: For when we come to the actual acquaintance of it, either by election or neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, it imports us in the firſt caſe, not to have fancyed ſuch a figure, as may have moved us to deſign it for a Miſtris to ſome melancholy Fancy; or in the laſt caſe, of conſtraint not to have preconceived any ſuch hard favor, or diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs, as may confuſe us in our firſt aboard of it: But ſome previduation of it is eaſilyer taken off by acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, then an over-charge of promiſes to our ſelves of peace and eaſe, can be made good unto us by our firſt communications with it; becauſe our mindes do eaſilyer acquieſce upon their propoſals of moderate conveniences, then they can ſetle upon their fall from high overvalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not therefore play the <hi>Painter</hi> in this draught of <hi>Solitude,</hi> but rather the <hi>Printer,</hi> by exhibiting the juſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of it, taken from the original ſtamp thereof, which I have in my hands, and ſhall deſign my print to bear the countenance and proportions of Truth, rather then the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſymmetries of a fair imagination, which is as <hi>Painters</hi> draw <hi>Angels,</hi> in whom they intend onely beauty, not ſimilitude: For I may own the having taken this Leſſon from <hi>Solitude,</hi> which I will practice upon her own figure, to prefer the benefit of the Reader, before the beauty of the Diſcourſe; and rather deſire to impart by Charity the uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Truth, then to affect the making my <hi>Solitude</hi> ſo lovely, as it may be rather good Company then good Counſel.</p>
               <p>This were to trade for Vanity with that Stock of Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude God hath given me to acquit the Mortgages of my time; and it is no mean bleſſing to be able to redeem time, even by the evils of our days. This is to grow ſo rich by the very <hi>Sequeſtration,</hi> as to be able to make proviſion of Liberty, peradventure at ſome time or other, even for ſome who are now Maſters of mine: For this my Map
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:115212:149"/>
of Solitude may be uſeful to all that are Travellers through the Changes and Viciſſitudes of Times, though they ſeemed never ſo fixed in any ſtation.</p>
               <p>I do therefore humbly preſent my Countrey with ſome Fruit of that Graft of Solitude it hath ſet upon the barren Stock of the other time of my Life, praiſing God that I may in ſome meaſure ſay with Saint <hi>Paul, The things which have happened to me, have faln out to the furtherance of my liberty in Chriſt; Philippians,</hi> Chapter the firſt, Verſe the twelfth.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not then endeavor to write the Laudative, but rather the Life of <hi>Solitude,</hi> in which the intermixtures of Good and Ill are co-incident to one another: And though I do not pretend the meaſures of my minde ſhould exactly fit many others, yet the matter of my propoſitions, which is Vertue and Piety, will endure the taking to pieces, and tranſlating into many good Forms, according to the ſizes of ſeveral Diſpoſitions.</p>
               <p>In God there is this inexplicable Myſtery, there is Unity, and Singleneſs without <hi>Solitude;</hi> for out of the Singularity of the Divine Eſſence, there is a Natural Fecundity and Emanation of a Plurality of Perſons, in which conſiſts Gods incapacity of ſolitarineſs; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this connatural Society, <hi>Divines</hi> affirm God might be ſaid to be ſolitary, even in the middeſt of all his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as Man was ſaid to be alone among all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of <hi>Paradice,</hi> before he had a Conſort of his own Nature. We need not ſtay any longer in this Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Divine Eſſence, clouded and overſhadowed with this Myſtery of a <hi>TRINITY</hi> in <hi>UNITY,</hi> it is ſufficient that it afford us but ſo much Light, as to ſhew, That Solitude is not conſonant to the Nature of Man, as he is GODS Image, and ſo proviſion was quickly made for that ſupply, after the ſingleneſs of his Creation.</p>
               <p>We muſt reſort then to ſome Supernatural intervention,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:115212:150"/>
that may mediate between Mans Nature, and the Nature of <hi>Solitude,</hi> when he is reduced to it; and thereby acquaint him with another kinde of ſociety, when he is ſequeſtred from that which is ſo familiar to him: Thus, as it were, rather tranſlating his communication into another language, then razing out the impreſſion in him of the love of company. And this is to change the nature of his ſociety, and not the ſociableneſs of his Nature.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Solitude divided into three ſorts; and the firſt diſcourſed of.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ME thinks all the ſtates of <hi>Solitude</hi> may be pertinently divided into theſe three ſorts, of <hi>Voluntary, Violent,</hi> and <hi>Neutral.</hi> The firſt is the operation of a Super natural <note place="margin">Voluntary Solitude defined.</note> agent upon Mans Will, which works upon it, as the Wiſe man ſays, <hi>Forcibly and ſweetly,</hi> drawing our mindes out of the world, in ſuch a gentle ſoft ſeparation, as vapors are extracted out of the earth, while the vertue of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Spirit attracts our Will out of groſſer immerſions in the earth, unto the pure ſpeculation of Divine objects; the grace of ſuch evocations <hi>falling</hi> (as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith) <hi>like dew upon a fleece.</hi> So as this egreſs out of the ſociety of the world, may be nominated ſupernatural in the means, though voluntary in the act.</p>
               <p>The next is, when any exterior natural agent forcibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives <note place="margin">Violent Solitude defined.</note> us of the liberty of all ſociety; and this may often be juſt, in order to the general ſociety of the world, which is maintained ſometimes by violences exerciſed on particulars; but is always offenſive to the nature of Man: And ſo I term this ſort of <hi>Solitude, Violent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third (which I ſtate as <hi>Neutral)</hi> is a mixture, and <note place="margin">Neutral Solitude defined.</note> compound between the aptneſs and conſtitution of particular
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:115212:150"/>
natures, and ſome exterior intervention of violence and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to that humor, by which we are moſt affected to the world; as a defeature of ſome hope, whereunto our mindes were moſt applyed, or ſome loſs, of what our affections had made an intire tranſaction of themſelves unto, or ſome inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry above our reach of any reparation, and many the like vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of our mindes in the world, upon which we break off correſpondence with it. And this condition of Solitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs I call <hi>Neutral,</hi> as having ſomewhat of both the other ſtates of <hi>Voluntary</hi> and <hi>Violent;</hi> for both theſe qualities concur to the compoſure of this kinde of ſeparation from Society.</p>
               <p>For the firſt ſort of theſe <hi>Solitudes,</hi> which I call <hi>Voluntary,</hi> that part of it which is diſagreeable to the inſtinct of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is reconciled by the mediation of the Author of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who nouriſheth the mindes, he calls ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I muſt confeſs my ſelf very unable to ſay anything in order to direction, either how to walk in theſe Suburbs of Heaven, or how to finde the beſt way to them; yet as one may print a good Map of a Countrey, or ſtamp of a City, and neither know the ſtreets and paſſages in it, nor the ways in the Countrey that lead to it; experience in both being requiſite for this capacity: So though I am not at all acquainted with the purity of this kinde of <hi>Solitude,</hi> knowing it onely by ſight, as having ſeen it in the Images of ſome <hi>Saints,</hi> I may have taken off this impreſſion handſomly, without any pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical skill in this Divine Exerciſe of Contemplation; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will onely ſay of it as a <hi>Holy man</hi> did of the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypſe, I admire it in what I do underſtand, and alſo what I do not underſtand, in honor of what I do:</hi> For truly the myſtery of this Angelical life, is like the white Stone promiſed in the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> in which a new Name is written, which none <note place="margin">Apoc. 2. 17.</note> know, but they that receive it: So that I can ſay nothing to inform ſuch as have received this white precious kinde of life, onely admire their felicity, who (like <hi>Moſes</hi> converſing with God) ſee the hinder parts of him in this life, and have as it were the earneſt given them of that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Neither eye hath ſeen, nor ear hath heard, nor hath it entred into the heart of man,</hi> the joy, I mean, of contemplating the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Eſſence face to face in the light of glory.</p>
               <p>What I may preſume to ſay pertinently in order to my deſign, is to deſire, That all men be very adviſed in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcernment of their vocation to this excellent kinde of <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> and to proceed as <hi>Samuel</hi> did, by <hi>Eli</hi>'s advice, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the voyce, not to preſume upon their firſt interior motions, though never ſo clear, but to ſtay for the iteration and preſſure of the ſame voyce often ſpeaking to them, and not to reſolve any thing finally, but by conformity to ſome Spiritual direction, to the end an acceptation of this excellent courſe may rather be the perſwaſion of Humility and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, then any promptitude or fervor of our temper and complexion: For the voice of God to this vocation, may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:115212:152"/>
be miſtaken, as the <hi>Jews</hi> took that which was a voice from Heaven for Thunder onely, ſo many take that for the voyce of God, which indeed is but the thunder of their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; ſome Spiritual fervors (compoſed of the vapors of their Nature, that lie under the clouds of the world) break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out into ſome loud diſcontent; which noiſe of our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors is often taken for the voyce of Grace.</p>
               <p>But this vocation is not ſo likely to be in the great wind of our firſt Spiritual impulſes, or in the flaſhes of our new fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, as in the gentle ayr and breath which the <hi>Prophet</hi> found the Spirit of God in; that is, in a ſoft and equal temper of Humility, and diffidence on the power and vertue of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural propenſions; <hi>not to truſt every Spirit, but to try the Spirit,</hi> is the beſt advice in this great undertaking, and to bring it to the teſt of a prudent Spiritual Director, who may upon due examination teſtifie to our Spirit, that this is the voyce of the eternal <hi>Word,</hi> which pronounceth this, <hi>Follow me.</hi> And when we have truly heard this voyce, and anſwered to it by a ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abnegation, then the hundred-fold which he aſſigned even in this life, is paid in the relinquiſhment of all, and diſſociation from the world, by this union with him, who is ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all we leave, as he is all we can wiſh to have.</p>

                  <hi>nor have I the knowledge of the Saints;</hi> ſo I may alſo own, That <hi>I have ſeen many things by erring,</hi> and going aſtray, whereby I have found, that the ſenſitive part hath often an equal voyce with the rational, in the election of this ſecond ſtate of Solitude, which I have ſtated as Neutral, and ſo will treat of it in the middle, between thoſe two I have termed <hi>Voluntary</hi> and <hi>Violent,</hi> as mixed and partaking of them both.</p>
               <p>What hath been ſaid of the great Patron of <hi>Solitude, John Baptiſt,</hi> may, in my conceit, ſort well with this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular I now deſcribe; to wit, That <hi>he was the Horizon of the Law and the Goſpel,</hi> his ſtate being a kinde of middle Circle that did divide thoſe two Haemiſpheres, touching upon each of them: Such a poſition doth this <hi>Neutral Solitude</hi> ſeem
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:115212:153"/>
to have, of being an <hi>Horizon</hi> between the two ſtates, of pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Voluntary,</hi> and <hi>Violent Solitude,</hi> as it is a middle term be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both of them, which parteth and diſterminateth them from one another, and partaketh of either of them: For indeed it toucheth both upon Freedom and Conſtraint; on the firſt, as it is an act of Election; on the latter, as it is an effect of ſome exterior compulſion, which notwithſtanding it cannot fully diſtrain the will, yet it lays ſuch forcible mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives upon it, as carry away the election in a poſture mixed between Conſent and Coaction; and this is the maner of our willing in many occaſions, when our Imagination ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſteth to our Will ſome apparent good, under the form of Real, and moving this choyce in a kinde of imperious maner of perſwaſion, carrieth the election, which although it be always voluntary in the act, yet may be ſaid to be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in reſpect of the means that wrought it; foraſmuch as that voluntary act holds more of the imperfection, then of the perfection of Free-wil, as being an act contrary to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Reaſon, thatdoth dictate rather the choyce of the real good, then the apparent, which is preferred in this election.</p>
               <p>To elucidate this point, we may conſider, That the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels now cannot make ſuch a choyce, in reſpect their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acts are always perfect and regulated by right Reaſon, though before they did ſee God it was not ſo, as in <hi>Lucifer</hi> is clear: when therefore ſuch a vote is paſſed by our Will, it muſt needs argue a kinde of violence and tyranny indeed excerſeded over our Reaſon; and conſequently this choyce partaketh of violence in point of perfection of the act, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is likewiſe voluntary, in the order of our imperfect Natures, that are leſs truly free then Angels; albeit we may be ſaid to have an extenſion of liberty above them, <hi>viz.</hi> that we can chooſe as well to do evil as good, which amplitude argueth in effect imperfection and deficiency of liberty, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> any compleatment or perfection thereof: And for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, That by the order of Nature, the underſtanding ought to command in all rational elections; wherefore it is rather
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:115212:154"/>
a regulation of Nature to reſtrain the Will unto Reaſon, then any violence upon Free-will, to have it ſo confined or reſtrained.</p>
               <p>In proof whereof we may conſider, That even mans Will (which is now <hi>in via</hi> rebellious, when it cometh to be perfectionated in Heaven, or <hi>in patria,</hi> as Divines call it) will be reduced into this order and conformity; ſo while we finde this order inverted by the irregularity of our corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Nature, we may ſay many of our voluntary acts partake of a kinde of violence, when by the predominating of our Will over our Reaſon, they are rendred acts imperfect, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we may call them free: From whence ariſeth this mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amphibious kinde of election, which nevertheleſs doth not infringe the liberty of the Will, ſince that electeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways freely; for no force of motives can riſe to a direct compulſion of the Will: and the efficacy of extrinſecal impreſſions, in this caſe, may be fairly illuſtrated by Gods maner of working upon the Will, which he moveth effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly to his own end, yet freely in order to her Natures preſerving his power and her liberty. After ſuch a ſort do external Motives very often carry the elective faculty of the Minde to ſome choyces and reſolutions, moving the Will with efficacy, and withal conveying it with freedom to the determination: And this is the caſe (I ſuppoſe) of what I term <hi>Neutral,</hi> or <hi>Mixed Solitude,</hi> when any exterior injury from the world preſſeth the Will vehemently, to elect this ſtate of life, which is often choſen, as in this mixed Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition hath been repreſented: Wherefore the chief in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment of this Diſcourſe, ſhall be to furniſh the Will with ſuch precautions, as may fortifie her againſt ſuch violent aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults of the Imagination in this act of ſo great importance.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Treating divers Motives that ſolicite this vocation.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe Soul of man being the ſeat of the Divine Image in Humane Nature, the inſtinct of ſociableneſs may be ſaid to be the eye, or the ſight of the Divine Image in it; for as the eye is the organ of light, which conveyeth to us the chiefeſt ſociety of all material things (and thence is the nobleſt maner of Commerce the Body hath with the World, as conſequently the worthieſt por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our ſenſitive Nature) So the inſtinct and Natural ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency of Society, is the nobleſt faculty of our intellectual: For by Society we receive all our rational light, as by the Eye we take all viſible ſpecies; and the love of company is not imprinted in us ſo much for our own private ſolace, as for the ſupport of the common frame of Humane Society: So that the ſociableneſs of Humane Nature, is in order to the conſervation and comfort of the whole, by a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent union of the parts: And the ſame reaſons that require a due diſpoſition of the ſeveral parts of our Natural body, for the decency and health of it, hold in the conſtitution of the Spiritual frame of our Nature, ſo as the love of Society <note place="margin">Definition of order.</note> is referred to the conſtituting of order, which conſiſteth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways of parts, and is nothing but a due marſhalling and ranking of divers and diſtinct portions, either in material things, or rational deſigns.</p>
               <p>Whereupon, ſince order is in Nature the final end of this impreſſion of the love of Society, an inordinate love of Company may be out of the order of the ſociableneſs of Humane Nature, as it may aim onely at ſome propriety that reſpecteth ſome ſuch ſingle deſire, as is much ſevered from the common good of Society: and ſo many ſelf-aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:115212:155"/>
may be in this reſpect ſaid rather to tend properly to Singularity then Society. According to this rule all the buſie negotiation of our paſſions, in the world, do rather break the chain of Society, then make part in the connexion, though they ſeem the onely rings and links whereof it is framed. Hence is it we ſo often ſee unruly and diſorderly activity, and purſuit of ſome appropriation, occaſion a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the world, as falling out with it upon the reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſome unduly affected propriety: And upon theſe terms many do often break with the world, and retire in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance of all other company, after this defeature of their particular pretence; and ſo in effect they rather flie from the world upon a repulſe in their aſſault, then leave it in neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of what it poſſeſſeth: Wherefore in this quarrel with the worlds party, many do often change their ſide at firſt in deſpight, rather then their minde in a ſincere diſtance of their affections from it; yet on our firſt eſtrangement from the world, upon difference with it, God is ſo Divinely compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate, as he doth not upbraid us with our firſt infidelity, in adhering ſo firmly to the advers party in all our ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſes, which we take as the pay of his enemies.</p>
               <p>All which truly underſtood, are but the exceſſes of Gods plenitude, who can afford even to his enemies, as his waſte and redundancy, theſe his temporal Bounties, ſince <hi>The earth is his, and the fulneſs thereof:</hi> Inſomuch as the infiniteneſs of the Divine goodneſs, is very often manifeſted moſt in the reception of ſuch as come in to him, upon the worlds caſhiering of them: For God accepts even his enemies <hi>Reformado's,</hi> and preferreth them often to great Truſts in his houſe.</p>
               <p>We cannot therefore diſcountenance this breach with the world, though at firſt it be not in direct order to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> for he to whom St. <hi>John</hi> forbade the caſting <note place="margin">Luke 9. 50.</note> out of Devils, becauſe he was not of <hi>Chriſts</hi> train, was not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding authorized by <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf: God reſolveth often (in this caſe of an indirect addreſs to him) as <hi>Chriſt</hi>
                  <pb n="329" facs="tcp:115212:155"/>
anſwered St. <hi>John,</hi> in the forecited occaſion, He taketh <hi>thoſe to be for him, who are not againſt him:</hi> for many of ſuch who are but ſo near <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſide as a declaration againſt the world, he doth often retain and ſetle in his ſervice.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Charity was a copy of this his Maſters, who rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at an acceſſion to <hi>Chriſt, whether it were either by pretence,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>or in truth:</hi> So God is glorified in ſome degree in many ſuch relinquiſhments of the world, which have at firſt more ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity then ſincerity of Devotion; becauſe this defiance hath always ſome apparence of victory over the world, which ſtill gives a kinde of alarm to the worlds party, and ſhews them the contempt of the world, ſtanding before them in ſuch a poſture, as ſtirs up ſome reflexion upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicableneſs of it, or at leaſt upon the diſtreſſes and dangers in it, and ſo moves, in ſome meaſure, towards a conſultation on their eſtates.</p>
               <p>Yet do I not upon this foundation adviſe any haſty incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate <hi>Sequeſtration</hi> of our ſelves from the world, though there are many (who like ſome criminal and <hi>Banditi</hi> retiring into the the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> onely for ſafety) have by the frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods domeſticks, been ſincerely converted into the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and have taken up the arms of the Spirit, with which they have combated onely the reſt of their life againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by continual mortification.

               <p>This happeneth when God in ſome rare caſes uſeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentally the worlds ſharp tools, as fit and proportionate to work on ſome ſtony hearts, wherein his Image is much defaced, which he hath notwithſtanding from all eternity deſigned for figures to ſtand in his houſe: But ſuch are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents of Gods Mercy, to reverence onely, not to relie upon; for <hi>God</hi> (as the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſaith) <hi>doth often take out a ſtony heart, and put one of fleſh in the room of it;</hi> whence the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi> telleth us, <hi>He hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>THere is no notion under which we can more apply look upon God, then as a Phyſician to our weak Nature: He who knows all the properties of Actives and Paſſives, applyes to all conſtitutions their proper reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; and as ſome Medicines are not proper both for Beaſts
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:115212:156"/>
and Man, in regard of their different tempers; So for brutiſh ſenſual perſons, there are required ſtronger Drugs, then to more reaſonable and ingenious diſpoſitions. The Word of God makes this difference often between voluptuous and ſenſual habitudes, and between pious and vertuous conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, calling the one Dogs, and the other Children; wherefore as the Phyſicians miniſter to ſome tempers onely ſuch Drugs which they call <hi>Benedicta,</hi> bleſſed ſimples, which work kindly, and yet effectually upon them, &amp; to others they are fain to preſcribe <hi>Minerals,</hi> and more violent Ingredients to move them: So there are ſome ſuch inſenſible habits of minde, as Gods <hi>Benedicta,</hi> his Bleſſings, and his gentle voyce of vocation doth not move; but their ſtrong Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture rather works upon them, and alters them, turning them into the nouriſhment of their paſſions, while all their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Benedictions are converted into aliment of their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualities.</p>
               <p>Therefore to ſuch indurate tempers, God miniſters often rude and violent Minerals, ſo unprepared, as they ſeem to the world to be poyſons; theſe we may call Affronts, Loſſes, Diſhonors, and all kinde of Diſappointments: and theſe violent compoſitions work upon their Natures, and alter it, by which their cure is performed; ſo that oftentimes the worlds Injuries prove R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Theſe inſinuations do work with many, ſo as to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden them to live profuſely upon the preſent ſtock of their Time and Fortune, with this purpoſe, of taking San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary either at ſome aſſigned time of their Age, or upon any preſſing Contingency. Hence is it, that taking their Councel of Gods Enemy, he preſents ſuch Clients to him, as have robb'd him all their life, in a purpoſe to repair to him for protection againſt the Law, and exemption from his hand of Juſtice; and thus, in effect, the houſe of Prayer is turned, and deſigned by ſuch Projectors, to be but an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor of Theeves.</p>
               <p>How often doth the Prince of Darkneſs amuſe many with this falacy, who walk with him in his large alleys, even by this light he ſhews them, by which they conceive to ſee

a ſafe iſſue out of this broad way, into the narrow paths of the Kingdom of Light? But alas! how many loſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this labyrinth, and are founder'd in this calm Sea of the world, even while they have this coaſt of retreat, and Solitude in their eye? And how many others, who are entred into the Port, ſink there, by thoſe leaks they bring in with them, never being able to ſtop thoſe overtures in their mindes, through which worldly affections and paſſions ſoak continually into their thoughts ſome ill habit or other, ſtill keeping intelligence with the world? And for this cauſe many either revolt back openly to it, or elſe hold ſome private treacherous correſpondence with it, in a nauſeouſneſs and diſtaſte of all Spiritual aliment, and a tepid irreſolution between breaking off and holding on that courſe; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in this nauſeouſneſs, we know how diſagreeable this temper is to Gods ſtomack; ſo that many preſuming to take this Water of Tryal, being polluted by a long co-habitation with temporal loves, it proves to them rather pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifaction, then purgation; and their mindes, in ſtead of a Spiritual conception and improvement, break out into an unſound and fruitleſs diſſipation.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>How unwillingly our Nature ſubmits to the loſs of Liberty and Society.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN the caſe we treated laſt, the Will needed a premonition againſt the deception of ſight; for our Will in fits of Melancholy, looketh commonly through the glaſs of our Imagination, upon ſuch objects as flatter that humor moſt: This Perſpective of our Fancy is often cut into ſuch angles, as repreſent various and falſe colours of perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, wherewith the Will is inveigled, ſuch ſpecies proving not real when our Reaſon cometh ſtrictly to overſee them. Therefore in the election of Solitude, the elective faculty was to be inſtructed againſt the falacies of diſcourſe, upon which, the Reſolution is to be grounded; but this caſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth a different direction: For here, the beſt courſe the Will can take to rectitude, is, to be totally blinded and ciel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that ſhe may make the ſtraighter mount upward to the eternal Will, and not amuſe or perplex her ſelf by looking about, with a ſolicitous inſpection into ſecond cauſes, but may pitch at the firſt flight upon the primary cauſe of all Contingencies.</p>
               <p>Our Nature requireth much precaution in this aptitude, to intangle us under the pretext of infranchiſement, by the
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:115212:160"/>
liberty of reaſoning out the Cauſes of all advers Accidents; for in this caſe of loſs of Liberty and Company, our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture likely ſeizeth on curious diſquiſitions of all Humane Reaſons, as the next thing ſhe takes hold on, to make com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany out of them, and the contrivement of iſſues out of theſe ſtraights, is a ſort of freedom our Nature takes, as ſome imaginary reparation in her neceſſity; by reaſon wherof theſe are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly the firſt occupations wherein our Fancy ſeeketh ſome divertiſement: and this entertainment may lighten the weight a little, by removing it to and fro in our Fancy, not letting a ſad apprehenſion ſetle upon our mindes; but all this agitation of diſcourſe, as long as it is but in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference about this world, and in the element of ſecondary Cauſes, is ſtill but a circular motion, which maketh no progreſſion to our end: for till our mindes are riſen and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the ſupreme Cauſe, all the various projects and motions of our Fancy, are but cooling a Feaver with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Society</hi> are two ſo dear Proprieties of Humane Nature, as natural Reaſon can give no equivalent exchange in ſatisfaction for them: The Author of Nature can onely recompence this privation of two of the beſt Functions of our being, and this by a communication of no leſs then his own Nature, which is, by filling up theſe breaches with his own Spirit, otherwiſe our Spirits will certainly remain empty and deſtitute of peace and conſolation: For God, who made Mans Society <hi>out of Man himſelf,</hi> hath left the love of Company ſo inviſcerated in him, as that deprive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeemeth now to take more then a <hi>rib out of him,</hi> even the better half of his Minde ſeems intrenched from him;
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:115212:161"/>
inſomuch as his Reaſon ſeemeth to be left but one-handed, to miniſter to him in this Exigence, which would require a reduplication rather for his ſupport; But Nature is ſo unable to make this ſupply, as for the redintegrating of his minde, he muſt reſort to a Supernatural ſuppeditation.</p>

                  <p>The deficiency of ſingle Natural Reaſon argued for Conſolation in this caſe; and the validity of Grace aſſerted.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WHen I conſider the ſtrange undertakings of the <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> me thinks they have charactered to us the power of Natural Reaſon, in a fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous figure or <hi>Romance,</hi> ſetting it out as vanquiſhing all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal ſenſibleneſs, armed with never ſo many ſtrong afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, diſſolving and diſinchanting all the Charms and Spells of Paſſions, although their characters be ſet never ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully againſt the efficacy of Reaſon, which they exhibite in this predominancy, diſperſing all Errors, rectifying all oblique Opinions; thus have they fancied the ſuperior part of the minde, inthroned in ſuch power as may eaſily blow away all ayr, even of any Sedition, that riſeth in the inferior Regions of the imaginative or ſenſitive faculties; Reaſon remaining in the poſture of the Queen of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> proclaiming, <hi>I ſit Queen, and am no Widow, and ſhall ſee us ſorrow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But they who account upon this Self-ſufficiency, ſhall quickly finde how impracticable theſe ſtrong ſpeculations will prove, when they are bound, and the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> are upon them; that is, incloſed in Solitude, and aſſailed by Natural diſtreſſes and vexations; if they ſhall then expect ſuch a <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> of their Reaſon, as they have ſeen painted by the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> that ſhould break through all theſe Monſters, and remain
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:115212:161"/>
fortified by all theſe labors, they will ſoon perceive their projected ſecurities had more of Poetry then of Propheſie: And ſure I believe one that truſteth to the power of Natural Reaſon, upon the word of Philoſophy, to deliver him from all faintneſs or deficiency of Spirit in this ſtate of <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Solitude,</hi> doth as if one ſhould perſwade himſelf inſpired with the vertue of ſome fabulous <hi>Heroe,</hi> with whoſe chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter he had been ſtrongly affected by reading his <hi>Romance;</hi> for when he comes to combat his vitiated Nature in this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual atchievement, he will finde ſuch a vanity in his ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. The Fable of <hi>Ixion</hi> is a good figure of this kinde of preſumption; for projecting to enjoy <hi>Juno</hi> (that is, ſome celeſtial Prerogative) they do but embrace a cloud, and by this mixture they beget nothing but <hi>Chymera's.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Certain it is, that <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> doth afford ſuch Spiritual <hi>Samſons,</hi> as carry the gates of their Priſons away upon their ſhoulders up to the Mountains, and break all their chains as flax, raiſing their mindes, with the <hi>Pſalmiſt, up to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> contemplating Gods Providence and his deſign upon them in ſo high a degree of reſignation, as even their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and their Solitude are rather Marks to them of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, then Manacles of their Spirits; but the ſtrength of ſuch <hi>Samſons</hi> is derived from the vow, not from the veins or ſinews of Nature: Is it by their offering up and conſecrating their Reaſon to that Spirit, whoſe breath <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws all the ſtrong holds,</hi> and deſtroyeth all the councels <note place="margin">2 Cor. 10.</note> of Self-ſufficiency, and repleniſheth the evacuation which is made of our own Reaſon, to make room for that infuſion: therefore ſuch victorious Spirits profeſs, That the <hi>weapons of their warfare are not carnal,</hi> but ſuch as are mighty to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying of all the counſels of humanity, <hi>and bring into captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty all underſtanding unto the obedience of Chriſt;</hi> for as he himſelf aſſureth us, <hi>If the Son of man make you free, you ſhall be free in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed:</hi>

                  <p>Great benefit acknowledged to Moral Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, and the right uſe thereof directed in order to our ſolacing.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BY this redargution of the arragancies of meer <hi>Rationa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts,</hi> I do not purpoſe to reject the uſe of Moral Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, in this great work of conſolation in diſtreſſes, but to rank it in a due order, miniſtring and ſubſervient unto Grace; For when <hi>the peace of God, which paſſeth all underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> is ſeated as the Principal, then Moral Reaſons are ſitly received, as ſerviceable Acceſſaries to the Solace and Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the minde: If we ſhould firſt examine and try the Principles of <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> by the beſt extent of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Reaſon, we ſhall never accept the Myſteries of the <hi>Trinity</hi> from the ſingle hand of Rational perſwaſion; But when we have pitched our belief of this Verity upon the <hi>Word of God,</hi> when our Faith hath carried our aſſent as high as Heaven upon her wing, from thence we may then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to the <hi>Orb of Reaſon,</hi> where Diſcourſe affordeth us many Similitudes and Congruities, to open and illuſtrate
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:115212:164"/>
to our apprehenſion this Myſtery, in ſuch ſort, as to bring it as it were within ſight of Humane <hi>Reaſon,</hi> in ſome obſcure and imperfect notion: So when we have firſt erected our expectance of confort and ſupport upon the Divine ſtation of Grace, then we may ſtep downwards upon the paces and gradations of Reaſon, and finde there ſolidity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation for our mindes whereupon to reſt, walk and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe themſelves; For then we uſe Moral Diſcourſe, but as an Organ whereby God conveyeth to us the clarity and eluci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the nobleneſs of the ſoul, indued by his grace with this capacity of remaining impaſſive in all exterior violence.</p>
               <p>In order to the illuſtrating this Poſition, the precepts of Philoſophy come in the ſtronger, when they enter in their due places, unfolding to us the nature of the Univerſe, and ſpreading fairly before us the contempt of all Temporali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, by divers detections of the infidelity of all things ſublunary. Thus after the right marſhalling of this Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liary ſuccor, the more ſtock we have of Moral Philoſophy, the more inlargement we may make of the Recreations of our Spirit, in theſe ſtraights of our condition; For as a very learned Humaniſt, converted to Chriſtianity, is the more able, by the means of this learning, to explicate and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the Doctrine whereof he is perſwaded: In like maner, after this firſt conviction of our mindes, touching the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of our primary recourſe to Grace, for the rectitude and conformity of our hearts, they who are the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant with the Precepts of Reaſon and Philoſophy, ſhall be the beſt qualified by theſe helps, for the amplification of their entertainments, and ſweetning the Natural aſperity of Solitude.</p>
               <p>We muſt be ſure then to fix this Principle in our thoughts, that all Humane Philoſophy doth but the part of the wate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="347" facs="tcp:115212:164"/>
admirable effect; Reaſon is uſed by that ſupreme agent, to take off the foulneſs and impurity of terreſtial objects from the eye of our Minde, and to open it into the ſpeculation of vertue, but it is Grace which worketh the Miracle of this Serenity of Spirit, by theſe inſtrumental illuminations of Reaſon: As long then as Philoſophy is kept onely as a hand-maid, with her <hi>eyes looking always upon the eye of her Miſtreſs</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.</note> (which is Grace, the gift of God) ſo long ſhe proveth very uſeful to her ſervice; but where ſhe is ſeated as ſingle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the family, all her ſpecious precepts and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions will prove (as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> termeth them) <hi>but learned fables,</hi> when this practical office is required of them, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate the minde in that regularity and apathy whereof they are ſo confident projectors.</p>
               <p>Having ſetled this Maxime, as Diſciples of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> for the fundamental article of Spiritual compoſure, <hi>My ſoul, wait thou upon God, for from him is my patience;</hi> then <note place="margin">Pſal. 61.</note> the diſcourſings and arguments of Morality are proper ſtuff to adorn our mindes, that they remain not bare and naked, but furniſhed with convenient matter of meditation and entertainment: Humane literature may be uſed in this order, as Ceremonies are in Religion, which are requiſite to excite and detain Devotion and Reverence in our Nature, that is affected much with ſenſible coverings of Spiritualities, which affording, as I may ſay, no hold for our Senſes, our Mindes are not ſo eaſily ſtaid and fixed in an attention upon ſuch Duties; therefore ſuch occupations of our Senſes, are very pertinent towards the raiſing and arreſting our Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In like maner the flowers and adornments of Moral Philoſophy, are apt and ſerviceable for the affecting and entertaining our Imagination, by the gracefulneſs and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy of their perſwaſions, which are very congruent with the nature of our Affections, that incline moſt to notions a little aſperſed with ſenſible matter, and ſo are eaſilieſt ſtaid and quieted in ſuch attentions, which hold our Spirits in a more cheerful application to the Arguments of rectified Reaſon.</p>

               <p>So that the uſes of Philoſophy are much improved by this their proper application, to illuſtrate the amiableneſs of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; and by the gaining of our Fancy, to facilitate the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of our Affections to our Reaſon, whereunto Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane learning conduceth in many reſpects; and it may not unaptly be ſaid to be a kinde of Spiritual <hi>Heraldry</hi> that doth blazon the Arms of Natural Reaſon, ſhewing the genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy and deſcent thereof from <hi>the Father of Lights,</hi> and marketh the affinities and alliances between <hi>Grace and Nature,</hi> keeping a Regiſter of the Antiquity and Nobility of Moral Vertue, in the examples and precedents of all Times; and

                  <hi>peace as the world giveth, but ſuch as none ſhall take from us;</hi> upon this foundation we may deſign the frame of our time into ſeveral rooms and offices, reſpectively to our Duties to God, and the diverſions of our own minde, to make this ſort of life both as uſeful and as agreeable as we can: For this kinde of Solitude is acknowledged to be a burthen to our Nature, and ſo by parting and dividing it as it were into ſeveral parcels, we ſeem to carry the leſs of it at once; whence it becomes of eaſier portage. By the experience I have had of the benefit of this method, I ſhould adviſe every one in this caſe to make partitions of the day into ſeveral hours, aſſigned to diſtinct occupations, beginning in the morning with the intentional Sacrifice of the whole day to the honor of God, looking upon this memorial S. <hi>Bernard</hi> peruſed every morning, <hi>Bernarde ad quid veniſti? Bernard,</hi> what wert thou born for? This queſtion to our ſelves, of what we are come into the world for, may eaſily afford us this reſolution, That we have no time to ſpare in the longeſt day, for that work for which we were created; having then in the beginning of every day made this Free-will offering of all our time, we may take ſuch portions as are allowed us back, after this conſecration, and divide them into ſuch pieces, and dreſs them in thoſe maners, as beſt agree with
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:115212:166"/>
the appetites of our minde, both to nouriſh our Soul, as well as to ſolace and recreate our Imagination.</p>
               <p>I ſhould adviſe then, that every day may be cut out into ſeveral portions of entertainments, in that company (which I ſuppoſe onely allowed) that is, the converſation of Books; which addreſs I need not recommend to any in this caſe: for in this civil death, we do naturally repair to the ſociety of the dead; and in Books we finde a civil Reſurrection of the dead for our converſation: And by this ſort of intombning our thoughts, we revive our Spirits, and have better or worſe company, according to the qualities of thoſe Spirits we chooſe to converſe with (for I ſuppoſe this allowance in this civil death, of free intelligence with all theſe kindes of Shrines and Reliques of the dead) and I do not mean to make a new commitment of any body's minde, reſtraining them onely to <hi>Mount Thabor,</hi> with <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> that is, to Books of Devotion and Contemplation; they may, as I have explained, walk not onely innocently, but uſefully in the ways of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> out of all ſorts of Philoſophy, Hiſtory, Policy, and out of lighter food of Humanity, there may be wholſom nouriſhment drawn and aſſimilated to a good conſtitution of minde; yet certainly the ſolider and purer the aliment is we feed upon, the ſtronger and ſounder complexion we ſhall induce: But what licences ſoever our Fancies take for their recreation, our Spirits muſt be regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in this, to taſte conſtantly of the Morning and Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sacrifice of the Temple; that is, in each half of the day there ought to be ſome hour aſſigned, to the reading of ſome Book of Devotion; this practice will keep the fire on the Altar always alive, which by an inſenſible perſpiration breatheth out a pious warmth into all the other innocent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations of our mindes; nor is it required, that the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Religion and Piety ſhould be always blazing in our cogitations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>When we have thus portioned out our day into ſeveral aſſignments of Prayer, Reading or Meditation, we ſhall not
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:115212:167"/>
feel the weight of the whole day upon us all at once, onely ſuch hours by themſelves as are ſucceſſively chained upon one another, by links of various occupations, and every ſuch diviſion, as it hath ſome ayr of variety in it, ſeemeth rather a recreation, then a charge upon the minde, which muſt be cheriſhed with thoſe diverſities that may (as near as we can draw them) reſemble liberty; and when all our time is parcell'd out into different voluntary addreſſes, there being no ſpaces left void or empty, time weigheth much the lighter, the leſs vacuity is left in it; for nothing nauſeateth the minde ſo ſoon, as an emptineſs of thoughts, beſpoken and fitted for her entertainment, ſince in that vacuouſneſs the winds and vapors of tediouſneſs and diſplicence riſe and fume out of our imagination into our Spirits, whereas a convenient repleniſhment of the Fancy, with change of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, doth much ſuppreſs ſuch fumes.</p>
               <p>We may learn, me thinks, by the eye of the body, how to accommodate objects to the ſight of the minde, for both of them are beſt pleaſed with the diverſity of ſpecies, and the competent determination of the proſpect; which order and interpoſure of various and alternate attentions, afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth both the change and the limitation agreeable to each of theſe appetencies, every ſeveral tranciſion of our thoughts to different occupations, breaketh the vaſtneſs of Solitude, by a competent termination of the proſpect, when our ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination looketh no farther then that term of time allotted for that ſingle exerciſe. Theſe interſertions of differing entertainments, are like woods or hills, which reſt the ſight in this vaſt proſpect of Solitude, affording our Fancies this agreeable intermixture of variety and reſt: So that by this method of an interchanging mixture of Prayer and Study, one may approach to that Bleſſing the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth, <hi>The Lord will make our wilderneſs like Eden, and our</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Having given this advice for the lightening of our time, we muſt not forget ſome order for the weighing it, that the
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:115212:167"/>
value may be taken together with the meaſure; for indeed the worth of time rightly pondered and ballanced by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, may outweigh any Liberty or Company, which either imbaſe the value of time unto us, or ſteal from us any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive proportions of that which is the onely Stock we have for the purchaſe of a bleſſed Eternity: And we know how familiar it is, to aſſign our Liberties and Companies to the diſcharging us onely of our time, as if the pleaſure of our life were but the ſmothering or making away of precious time: They then (who ſeriouſly reflect upon the loſs of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, wherewith vain paſſions may be charged (by which our mindes are truly impriſoned, while they are dallying with theſe ſimilitudes of Priſons and Chains, to inlarge the liberties of their Fancy) when they come to underſtand and affect rightly the freedom of their mindes) may judge this ſevering from ſuch temptations and faſcinating vanities, to be a ſtate of real infranchiſement, and eſteem the other giddy agitation of their perſons up and down the world, floating upon their Fancies, but as a Priſoners Dream, wherein he may imagine himſelf Maſter of his own Keepers, while he is faſter in hold then when he is awake, and truly apprehending his condition.</p>
               <p>They whoſe mindes then are guilty of theſe kindes of crimes, of making away their time, and uſing their former liberties, as inſtruments in this miſchief, let them Arraign their Imaginations upon this Indictment of their Memories; for by judging and caſting themſelves, they may make a new life out of this ſuffering and execution of their faulty liberties; which if their Priſon put to death in their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as it doth extinguiſh in their practices, they will conclude themſelves rather reſuſcitated then reſtrained: How happy may they be accounted, who come to redeem time ever by the evilneſs of their days, to whoſe civil death and moral reſurrection this of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> may be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>What was ſown in corruption, is raiſed in incorruption; and</hi>

And as theſe two Heads do not differ much in their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legories, ſince all the Heads of the Beaſt may be ſaid to ſignifie ſeveral mundanities; ſo are they conſorted in this point, of having both the ſame Surgeon, the old Serpent, who venteth all his Art upon the recovery of this Head, namely, The love of mundanity, wherein do indeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the vital Spirits of the body of Sin, the onely Subject of the Prince of this Ages Empire.</p>
               <p>So that conſidering the dangerous convaleſcence of this wounded Head, I have conceived it requiſite to do my beſt, not onely to kill it outright by playing <hi>Jael</hi>'s part, driving this Nail, that is, this expreſs Tract directly through the temples of it, but alſo to endeavor the burying it, as I may ſay, in this holy ground of Spiritual Joy and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcence, which is the ſafeſt courſe to prevent the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vival of it; for the alacrity of the Spirit keepeth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior appetites, as it were, under ground: and in this figurative interment, the Balms and Spices of contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Solaces, contrary to material ones, have this vertue, quickly to conſume and diſſolve this matter, when they are applied unto it: I ſhall therefore endeavor to draw out of the incloſed Garden of the Spouſe, ſuch precious Spices as may work theſe two different effects, to diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate and conſume the love of this world, as well as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and perſume the love of Heaven.</p>
               <p>One Sin infected our whole Humane Nature, by reaſon that all ſucceeding individuals had then their voyces com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed in one perſon Repreſentative of the whole Species: And when we ſee the whole Maſs of the Earth accurſed at <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 17.</note> once, me thinks we may ſpeculate this to have been ſome part of the reaſon, that in the little portion of Earth, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the body of Man, the whole Globe thereof ſeemed repreſented, and conſequently all tainted by the inquina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that one parcel; for the ſenſitive part of Man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of Earth, that may well be charged as a Complice in the Crime, ſince that portion of Man, although it were
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:115212:179"/>
not Principal, was yet an acceſſory in the Crime, the body having acted the tranſgreſſion: This may give an ingenious reaſon for the Condemnation of the whole Earth, to bear onely Thorns and Bryers naturally, and fruits not without induring wounds and violences, to wit, the contamina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole, in the vitiouſneſs of this firſt ungrateful portion of Earth, which, in the perſon of Woman, may be ſaid to have put forth ſome Bryers to catch the Soul of Man, even before it was accurſed. This I preſume to be a better Reaſon for the ſentencing of the whole Earth, then can be given for the Soul of Man's adhering to this Earth by his affections; foraſmuch as this convinceth us of the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial parts of conſpiration of our ruine, and ſo may well averſe the Soul from ſuch an adherency.</p>
               <p>How evident is it, that God never intended that the Soul of Man (after this firſt injury) ſhould ſet her affections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth, ſince Man was preſently removed from the moſt lovely part thereof, and that was fenced againſt his acceſs to it, not onely to ſhorten his time upon Earth, but alſo, as we may ſuppoſe, to abridge his Delights and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces in that ſhort time, ſince no other part of the World could afford ſuch a complete deliciouſneſs, as the earthly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice out of which Man was excluded; whereby God ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to have provided againſt Mans having the ſtrongeſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives the Earth might offer him, to draw down his affections upon it, and hath left him a continual quarrel, as it were, with the Earth; to wit, the Contention of his labors againſt her ſterility, to entertain this diſagreement between it and the love of Man, ſince the Earth alloweth him nothing, but at the price of his ſweat and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I May well ſuppoſe that there will be many, who being dazled by the radiancy of the faces of theſe <hi>Moſes's</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 35.</note> we have expoſed, will, with the people, turn their heads away from this object: And I may imagine, that ſome (as being taken with the beauty of this light) will conclude with the <hi>Apoſtles, That it is good to live upon this Mount,</hi> and may perchance think of making Tabernacles for their abode in this place; that is, deſign all the powers of their mindes to the forming in themſelves ſuch a ſtate of <hi>Contemplation:</hi> wherefore it may be pertinent to look a little downward up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch ſubjacent ſtations as are the direct way up to the top of the Mountain, whereunto the neareſt conterminate part is that of <hi>Speculation;</hi> and the next to that, <hi>Lecture;</hi> and after that <hi>Mortification,</hi> which lieth indeed as the baſis of all the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: and as it hath this property of the ground-work, to conſiſt of the moſt groſs matter, ſo hath it this likewiſe, of being the ſupport of the whole erection; and in that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der I will re-aſcend to the ſummity from whence I have diſmounted.</p>
               <p>While the Soul of Man receives no intelligible ſpecies, but ſuch as are raiſed from ſenſible matter, and acteth onely by corporeal organs, by Natural Reaſon it is evident, why Mortification is requiſite for the beſt extent of her intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual

               <p>I ſhall not need to argue how much corporeal pleaſures and ſenſualities do obſcure the light received by the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive faculty, and clog the operations of the reaſoning power of the Minde; Wherefore even in this Natural reſpect, a convenient ſuppreſſion of the appetites of the Fleſh ſeemeth the platform of all Spiritual exaltation; but we have a firmer ſupernatural ground, whereupon to raiſe this Concluſion, of the requiſiteneſs of Mortification to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſpeculative gifts, the word of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> ſaying, <hi>They that are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God;</hi> and if they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> even from Gods favor, they muſt needs be very diſtantial from that grace and familiarity, which is impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Contemplation:</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was allowed ſo little to think of his body, when he was raiſed to his higheſt point of illumination, as he knew not whether he had any body about him, or no, at that time: And we finde that he took the beſt courſe he could all his life, to feel the leaſt he might poſſibly of his body; in order whereunto he ſaith, <hi>He did not onely chaſtiſe his body, and keep it in ſubjection,</hi> but <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.</note> affirmeth likewiſe, That <hi>he did dye daily:</hi> It ſeemeth he found no means of clearing the operations of the Soul, but by making, as it were, a quotidian ſeparation between her and the Fleſh; And, me thinks, we may ſay of all Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> converted life (notwithſtanding his humility in owning infirmities) that which he himſelf ſaid of ſome part of it, namely, <hi>Whether this man in Chriſt lived in his body, or out</hi>

                  <p>The requiſiteneſs of Lecture, in order to this Spiritual elevation.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe next Stage whereby we are to riſe, is pious <hi>Lecture;</hi> which ſubject calls back my thoughts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firſt ſtate of mans knowledge; wherein we may conſider, That the firſt Humane Soul came into this world, perfect in the intellectual part, by Science infuſed, and needed not ſtay for the help of her corporeal organs to acquire any, for thoſe inſtruments whereby ſhe was to act, were ready in their perfection, before ſhe was ſeated in them, ſince Gods forming perfectly the body of man, preceded his breathing into it the breath of Life: And ſo we finde that he was able to reade preſently in the book of Gods works, wherein he read the character of Gods hand in every creature that was ſet before him; and, as I may ſay, ſuperſcribed their names upon them, by the ſecret impreſſion he read of their Nature: But not being ſatisfied with this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent degree of intelligence, he began to affect the reading even in Gods own increated book, The knowing like God himſelf. Upon this preſumption the rational ſoul of Man was caſt down from this high form, and ſet ſo much back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as ever ſince both the Vegetative and Senſitive ſouls precede her long in the perfection of their acts, and ſhe is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to ſtay their leiſure before ſhe can act her beſt accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her faculty, which muſt coſt her alſo pains and care to reduce it unto the beſt extent thereof.</p>
               <p>Thus is now the rational Soul, ſentenced to feed her ſelf by her kinde of ſweat and labor; ſo that ſhe is not onely to acquire moſt of her natural knowledges, by a laborious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, but ſhe is alſo ſet to work by ſtudy and attention, even upon thoſe ſupernatural Principles that are infuſed into her, as thoſe of <hi>Faith, Hope</hi> and <hi>Charity;</hi> even theſe infuſed habits will not ſo much as remain in her, without her own
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:115212:188"/>
ſtudy and ſolicitude to preſerve them, much leſs can they be improved to their beſt degree, without much intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and application: And to facilitate the perfection of the Soul in this life, God hath been pleaſed to make his own Character, and to leave it legible under his own Hand, his holy <hi>Scriptures,</hi> wherein all his attributes are penn'd in the faireſt maner, to affect our underſtandings, and to take our affections; inſomuch as of the holy Writ it may be well ſaid to God, <hi>The light of thy countenance is impreſſed upon it:</hi> This living ſpring of Verities the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> hath left upon <note place="margin">Pſal. 4.</note> the earth, from whence all the rivelets of pious Books de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive their waters, which are ſo proper to refreſh and ſee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date the minde of Man, as the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> doth but rarely uſe his own power of impregnating and repleniſhing Souls with immediate inſpirations, but vouchſafeth, for the moſt part, to be conveyed into our mindes by the mediate ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations into them of vertuous notions, from his ſubalternate inſtruments, the pens of his holy Miniſters, which he doth certainly inſpire with qualities <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o well proportioned to our capacities, as they deliver Divine Truths unto our mindes, under ſuch familiar and agreeable forms as are moſt apt to work upon our affections.</p>
               <p>This is the deſign of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> in all pious Books, wherein his Spirit remaineth covered in the elements of mans conceptions (for words may be ſaid to be a kinde of body to thoughts) as the Divinity of <hi>Chriſt</hi> did under the vails of Fleſh and Blood. In like maner it is the Divine vertue of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> that worketh all thoſe devout effects which are produced by the inſtrumental conceptions of pious Writers: Wherefore as the Scriptures are to be read with perſwaſion, that God is preſentially ſpeaking to us, ſo all Books of Devotion are to be uſed with this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, of their ſpeaking to us, as delegated and deputed from God.</p>
               <p>The minde of Man abhorreth vacuity, and though her Nature tend upward to be repleniſhed with Spiritual no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:115212:189"/>
yet if ſhe be void of them, ſhe ſinketh preſently to earth, to take in any groſſer furniture; ſo that if ſhe be not provided with ſuch pure ſpecies as may keep her point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at her own Centre, in ſtead of being elevated, as it were, above her ſelf in <hi>Contemplation,</hi> ſhe will fall below her ſelf into ſome terrene amuzement: Wherefore a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of pious Lecture is moſt neceſſary, in order to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhing her with Spiritual Images, that may keep her eye always erected up upon them; and may we not well infer the requiſiteneſs of reading, for the ſupport of the Spiritual Man, ſince Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth not onely adviſe his <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 13.</note> ſo elevated Diſciple <hi>Timothy</hi> to attend unto reading, but chargeth him with great ſolicitude to bring him ſome Books, even after he had told him he had <hi>conſummated his</hi>

                  <hi>courſe, and the time of his revolution was near;</hi> If he who had been in <hi>Paradice</hi> already in a <hi>tranſcient</hi> ſtate, and was ſo near his going thither to a <hi>permanent,</hi> did ſtill make uſe of Books, how neceſſary muſt they be for all ſuch as aſpire to any Spiritual exaltation?</p>

               <p>THis laſt ſtation carrieth us up to the top of this <hi>Mount Moria,</hi> from whence we have deſcended, and ſo is the ſteepeſt part, and the uneaſieſt mounting of all the reſt, as it is neareſt the vertical point of our fixure: This laſt ſtep then is <hi>Speculation</hi> or <hi>Meditating,</hi> which act of our diſcurſive faculty, is commonly taken as univocal, with this other of our minde fixed in <hi>Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> but when they are rightly diſtinguiſhed, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth ſuch a diverſity, as is between the laſt ſtrains of motion, and the term of acquieſcence: For <hi>Speculation</hi> is <note place="margin">Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined.</note> properly the buſie attention of the minde in the inqueſt of truth, ranging and caſting out all ways, to bring in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for the Spirit to fix and reſt upon in <hi>Contemplation;</hi> which (as I have ſaid) is a fruitive poſſeſſion of Verities, which flowers the minde doth no longer gather or collect, but rather hold in her hand ready made up in noſegays that ſhe is ſmelling to.</p>
               <p>Me thinks theſe two different ſtates of the Minde may be rendred very intelligible, by a conception my Fancy hath ſprung, while it is ranging for ſome fit expreſſion of this very act which my Minde is now exerciſing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I may ſay, That <hi>Speculation</hi> and <hi>Contemplation</hi> differ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I ſhall by means of this ſtudious Application of thoſe powers of my Minde, form ſome digeſted Character of what I deſign; which finiſhed Draught of my own thoughts, when I ſhall reade over, I ſhall no longer work upon it, but behold the Image I have framed out of the paſt diviſions and compoundings of my thoughts, and then my Minde will reſt and enjoy my determined notions: So that as I do now ſpeculate, and ſhall upon the finiſhing of theſe two Characters, contemplate them, without any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther agitation of my Minde: In like maner the ſtate of <hi>Speculation</hi> is a diſquiſition of ſundry Divine Verities, whereby to form ſome determined notions, which are the objects that <hi>Contemplation</hi> is to be fixed upon in an acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcent ſtate, when the diſcurſive motion is arrived at the term of reſt it pointed at; and then contemplating the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of our former diſcourſings, we do, as it were, reade over and enjoy this digeſt of our Imaginations: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the act of our Comprehending doth excel that of our Reaſoning, in reſpect the intellect ſees at one look or intuition what the Reaſon collecteth but by divers circuits of Diſcourſe, and ſo ſeemeth but a purveyor of what the intelligence poſſeſſeth in one inſtant: In like maner the Contemplative ſtate, by the ſame reaſon, tranſcends the Speculative; and, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
