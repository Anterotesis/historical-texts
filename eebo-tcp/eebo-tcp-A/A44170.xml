            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>BE the Tongue blister'd that shall dare prefer</l>
            <l>The Cause and Courage of <hi>John Presbyter;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And the Quill lighter then a feather thought,</l>
            <l>That such Phanatick madness shall be taught,</l>
            <l>As praise that Cap of Zeal, which lined comes,</l>
            <l>Without with Cruel, and within with Thrums.</l>
            <l>See where the Rabble, with their lugging ears,</l>
            <l>And arm'd with black Sedition, appears</l>
            <l>In Knots of wilde Rebellion, like a Bed</l>
            <l>Of hissing Serpents with Contagion fed:</l>
            <l>And that their Followers may the more adore them,</l>
            <l>Their godly Leaders walk in Cloaks before them.</l>
            <l>For since Sedition did this Age provoke,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Jack Presbyter</hi> hath ever chose the Cloak;</l>
            <l>And makes that Garment at all times to be</l>
            <l>A signal Cloak of his Hypocrisie.</l>
            <l>They have a Cloak for every thing they do;</l>
            <l>A Cloak i'th' Street, a Cloak i'th' Pulpit too.</l>
            <l>A Cloak is all their Wear; and if they can,</l>
            <l>They'll have a Cloak to cozen God and Man.</l>
            <l>The Cloak doth act more mischief in the Town,</l>
            <l>Then all the long Addresses of the Gown.</l>
            <l>'Twas in his Cloak that <hi>JENKINS</hi> up did cry</l>
            <l>'Gainst our late King another Crucifie:</l>
            <l>'Twas in his Cloak he seem'd Another man,</l>
            <l>And finely learnt to turn the Cat i'th' Pan:</l>
            <l>'Twas in his Cloak returning to his Fever,</l>
            <l>That now he seems as fiery hot as ever.</l>
            <l>'Twas in his Cloak that <hi>BAXTER</hi> loud did bawl,</l>
            <l>Beloved listen, and hear <hi>BAXTERS</hi> Call:</l>
            <l>The Bishops of their Mitres dispossest,</l>
            <l>Will breed the Saints an Everlasting Rest.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:34480:3"/>
'Twas in his Cloak that <hi>CALAMY</hi> did spit</l>
            <l>Against Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> his Excremental Wit;</l>
            <l>And waspish <hi>WATSON</hi> did so loudly rore,</l>
            <l>And call'd his Mother, <hi>Englands</hi> Church, a Whore.</l>
            <l>'Twas in his Cloak that <hi>CARTER</hi> pray'd, to gain</l>
            <l>The sacred Scepter from his Soveraign;</l>
            <l>And mov'd his Hearers all, like true <hi>Pres-byters,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>To fight against the Bishops and their Mitres.</l>
            <l>'Twas in his Cloak that <hi>NYE</hi> late down did crie</l>
            <l>The Cross, the Surpliss, and the Liturgie;</l>
            <l>And hop'd ere long his Friends would have the Power</l>
            <l>To be again possessed of the Tower:</l>
            <l>That so the swarming <hi>Sectaries</hi> might rule</l>
            <l>From neerest <hi>Thames</hi> unto the farthest <hi>Thule.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And if they cannot do it, may those <hi>Elves</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Help in <hi>New-England,</hi> and then hang themselves.</l>
            <l>This is the Sense of all, This is the Ayer</l>
            <l>Of every true-born Presbyterian Prayer.</l>
            <l>With these is high the Anabaptist flown,</l>
            <l>Who will have no Religion but his own:</l>
            <l>They will conspire with all the Pow'rs of Hell,</l>
            <l>To bid both <hi>ORDER,</hi> Truth and Peace farewel.</l>
            <l>From such and All as are so refractory,</l>
            <l>And care for none, but their own Directory,</l>
            <l>Good Lord protect us! let Flames joyn with Flames,</l>
            <l>T'abate their Numbers, and devour their Names:</l>
            <l>Not their Church-buckets fill'd with Sisters tears,</l>
            <l>Nor dropping Clouds of Jealousies and Fears,</l>
            <l>(Could it rain Water fast as Bloud before)</l>
            <l>Shall longer save this Presbyterian Whore.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Smectymnuus</hi> be henceforth the Hang-mans name,</l>
            <l>And from his last dissecting hand take Fame.</l>
            <l>May All together in one Fire be brent,</l>
