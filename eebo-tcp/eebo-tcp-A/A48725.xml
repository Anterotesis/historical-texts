            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And so as in the <hi>former</hi> part of his Song he mournfully commemorates his Sickness: So in the <hi>latter</hi> part from the 15th. verse, to the end, he chearfully returns thanks for his Recovery.</p>
            <p>The words, we have made choice of, belong to this <hi>latter</hi> part; and there are four things in them observable.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A sad heavy affliction. <hi>Behold for peace I had great bitterness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. A merciful deliverance out of this affliction,


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105965:4"/>
               <hi>But thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the put of corruption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. A blessed improvement of this mercy, <hi>For thou hast cast all my sins behinde thy back.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. A thankful acknowledgement of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved mercy, <hi>in the rest of the words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Affliction</hi> aggravated,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By a description of it in its own nature, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>. both in the quality of it, 'twas <hi>bitterness;</hi> and in the quantity of it, 'twas <hi>great bitterness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. By opposition of the contrary blessing which it remov'd, 'twas <hi>for peace;</hi> a word, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends in the notion of it all our worldly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, all temporal blessings whatsoever; and more particularly in Holy Writ is taken for <hi>health,</hi> a blessing, without which all other blessings have no rellish in them, give no true satisfaction to the enjoyer, <hi>For peace I had great bitterness,</hi> i. e. for the health which he had formerly enjoy'd, he had had a very bitter sickness.</p>
            <p>And then lastly the bitterness of this change is heightned by the surprize of it. <hi>Behold,</hi> as a strange thing! <hi>Behold,</hi> how all on a sudden, <hi>upon my peace came great bitterness,</hi> as the Margin reads it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bitterness,</hi> and <hi>great bitterness,</hi> and that in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change <hi>for peace,</hi> for a state of health and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and all this with a sudden strange surprize.


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105965:5"/>
               <hi>Behold, for peace I had great bitterness.</hi> This was his <hi>Affliction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this much further aggravated still, if we unde stand it as we must, in a spiritual sense too; that his sickness calling his sins to remembrance, and causing some distrusts of God's love, instead of that <hi>peace</hi> of conscience, and quiet tranquillity of minde he had had heretofore, his spirit was now troubled, and greatly imbittered. And <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 4.</note> 
               <hi>a wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed grieved spirit who can bear?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other hand, the mercy of the <hi>Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>. wants not its heightning circumstances too: as,</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the efficient cause, 'twas God deliver'd him, <hi>But thou hast deliver'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. From the motive or impulsive cause, 'twas out of <hi>Love;</hi> not out of design, as men usually do courtesie: but out of a free kindeness, and that a love of the best sort; 'twas <hi>in love to his soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And 3. From the danger he was deliver'd out of, and that no ordinary one; it was a <hi>pit,</hi> and no ordinary pit neither, 'twas <hi>the pit of corruption,</hi> even the Grave, the very state of death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But thou hast in love to my soul deliver'd it from the pit of corruption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then, however he came by his sickness, he is sure 'twas <hi>God</hi> recover'd him out of it; and he did it out of <hi>Love,</hi> out of an especial love he bore to


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105965:5"/>
the <hi>soul</hi> of him, which was sufficiently manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this, that his life was precious in Gods sight, God delivering it <hi>from the pit of corruption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is this all. You heard 'twas a spiritual mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>. for 'twas in love to his soul; and therefore the health of body was to be attended with the welfare of his soul: and so for a full <hi>Assurance</hi> of Divine love to his soul, and for a further <hi>Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of this temporal bodily mercy, 'tis added; <hi>for thou hast cast all my sins behinde thy back,</hi> that, as God had imbrac'd his soul in the arms of his love; (so the Interlinear Version, <hi>Amplexus es amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re animam meam)</hi> and as it were put her into his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som; so he had cast all his sins behinde his back, never to come more into remembrance.</p>
            <p>This is the Crown of Mercies, when tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals are thus accumulated with spirituals; this a recovery indeed of the whole man, when health is improv'd into salvation, and strength of body ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with pardon of sins. This is right <hi>saving Health,</hi> and deserves the returns of a grateful <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment,</hi> which now follows in the last place.</p>
            <p>And that is set forth, first, by shewing the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility for the dead to perform this duty, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/>. which is very elegantly express'd by three <hi>Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the grave cannot praise thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Death cannot celebrate thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:105965:6"/>
               <hi>They that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>which all come to one meaning.</p>
            <p>And then on the contrary, shewing not the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility only, but the probability that <hi>the living</hi> will, i. e. such as divine mercy continues in life, and especially such as are by that mercy preserv'd from imminent danger of death.—</p>
            <q>—The living, the living, he shall praise thee.</q>
            <p>And this probability exemplified in himself, made good by his own practice;—</p>
            <q>—As I do this day.</q>
            <p>Thus having open'd the several scenes of our intended meditation, I shall now proceed to draw from them some useful <hi>Observations,</hi> interweaving their applications all along, with that brevity and clearness, as such copious heads of matter may in such straights of time admit; and that rather in a cursory Explanation, then in an elaborate dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
            <p>First, then for the <hi>Affliction,</hi> 'tis not only bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but in the abstract <hi>bitterness</hi> it self. The sense of Taste is the most necessary of all our senses, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that by which all <hi>Animals</hi> live, and take in their food and nourishment; and therefore has in it a power to judge, what is grateful and convenient to the nature of each kinde, what not. Now there


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105965:6"/>
is no gust the palate so much dis-relishes as the <hi>bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> nothing, that nature shews a greater abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to, or that is less welcome to her: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>Psalmist</hi> in the person of <hi>Christ</hi> looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as one of his enemies greatest unkindenesses, that they gave him <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ps.</hi> 69. 21.</note> 
               <hi>Gall and Vinegar to drink;</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> himself upon the Cross, (I suppose, out of his meer natural aversation, as he was man) when he had tasted of it, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>S. Matth.</hi> 27. 34.</note> 
               <hi>He would not drink it.</hi> Upon this score 'tis, that by an usual <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor</hi> every thing that is highly displeasing to any of our affections and senses, either to the rational or sensitive appetite, is termed <hi>bitter:</hi> every thing, I say that is any way afflictive to flesh and blood, any thing that ails us in Minde, or Body, or Estate, or good name; whether grief, or pain, or pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or reproach, and the like; we may as <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> here calls his sickness, give it the name of <hi>bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness:</hi> nay, even though those afflictions come from the hand of God himself our gracious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by whose providential dispensations every particular event, be it good or bad, is so carefully managed, that not a Sparrow falls to the ground without his order. And yet this bitterness too, though never so unpleasant, may be made profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, if we make a right use of it; as we may learn two things from it here,</p>
            <p n="1">1. not to be <hi>impatient.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:105965:7"/>
2. not to be <hi>insensible,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When we are under Gods hand in any affliction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fiezekiah</hi>'s being in bitterness teacheth us one, and his complaining of it the other.</p>
            <p>Who? Good King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> in bitterness? sick, and that unto death? this is bitterness indeed, that such a <hi>Prince,</hi> who was a National blessing; that such a <hi>Saint,</hi> who had <hi>walkt before the Lord in truth, and in the sincerity of his heart, done that which was</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>V.</hi> 3.</note> 
               <hi>good in his sight,</hi> should be cut off in the midst of his dayes at XXXIX. (for that was his age at this time; the fifteen years which were now added, making up his <note n="*" place="margin">See 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 1.</note> whole life LIV.) and should by a bitter and untimely death be sent away to the gates of the Grave, after the languishment of a pining distemper. Hence we observe, that <hi>Gods dearest ones are not exempted from bitter afflictions.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Obs.</note> And what are we then, that we should repine, and murmur, and think our selves hardly dealt with? Are we better then all those <hi>Saints,</hi> who have gone before us, who have pledg'd their Master in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty draughts of his <hi>Passion-Cup,</hi> and have march'd after him in the <hi>dolorous way</hi> towards heaven? This should teach us not only with <hi>patience,</hi> but even with chearfulness to take up our crosses, and to deny our selves in our healths, in our fortunes, in all our enjoyments. And to recommend this vertue the more to us, let us take along with us


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105965:7"/>
some considerations, why it pleases God to imbit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many times, as he does, the condition of his Children and Servants in this world. Now God does it upon such reasons as these; for the chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>. of sin, from which the very best are not free; for tryal and exercise of their faith and other Graces, which else would lie idle upon their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>. hands: for what use of patience in time of health and prosperity? and consequently for their amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and improvement. The Furnace is heated <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> over and over, that, having all their dross burnt up, their graces may be burnished and throughly refined, as Silver purified seven times in the fire. And tell me now, O impatient soul, whoever thou art, what reason hast thou to take Gods dealings unkindely? Tell me; canst thou say with any shew of reason, that he deals otherwise then justly and kindely by thee in all this; who orders all so to thy good, that his greatest severities are, if thou wilt but rightly understand them, the most advantageous mercies? Further, he does it to wean us from the world, and to take off that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>. hank, which the flesh has upon us; to mortifie carnal lusts, and worldly desires; and give us a heavenly relish. Thus when the Breast is imbit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, the Childe will of himself forsake it. And lastly, to prepare us for our great change: These <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>. conflicts and encounters we have with all sorts of


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105965:8"/>
affliction, during our whole life, are but Essayes and <hi>Specimens</hi> of that conquest, which we must through Christ make at last of death; that, as he has overcome the world, and swallowed up Death in victory, we may be made partakers of his triumphs; and having fill'd up his sufferings, may in his name set up our banners and our tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies; the banners of our confidence, and the trophies of our victory. And now, if we have any ingenuity to acknowledge our sins, any zeal to imploy our graces, any holy ambition to better and improve our selves, any desires towards hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or savour of spiritual things; in a word, any thought or design of living holy, and dying hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py: what reason have we with more then <hi>pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> even with kindeness and friendship, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain afflictions, which are to help us in all this.</p>
            <p>Yet let afflictions be as good as they will in the consequents and effects, they are afflictions still, and may be so resented. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion made very good use of his sickness, and found as great benefit by it; and yet still after his recovery he complains of it, and calls it <hi>bitterness.</hi> We must be <hi>pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,</hi> and yet we may be <hi>sensible</hi> of our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons too. <hi>We are allow'd the apprehensions of nature,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Obs.</note> 
               <hi>even in the exercises of Grace.</hi> A good man may be patient, and yet feel his pains, and complain of


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105965:8"/>
them too: or else indeed 'tis not a genuine pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. I do not think him truly valiant, whom ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour or amulet has made invulnerable; but him, that feels the smart of his wounds, and yet fights on. Thus our <hi>Saviour,</hi> the Captain of our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in his Agony, prayes to have the Cup pass from him, sayes bemoaningly of himself, that his <hi>Soul</hi> was <hi>sad unto death;</hi> that, as he hung on the Cross poor man at the stretch of every joynt, flouted by his Adversaries, deserted by his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, forsaken by his Father, he cries out, <hi>My God, my God,</hi> &amp;c. and being roasted with the scorching flames of Divine Wrath, he calls for drink to allay the raging heat of his <hi>thirst.</hi> For although the Divinity could have deaded all the pains, which the humane nature underwent, and have raptur'd it into a glorious impassibility: yet that was not to be, since the main merit of his passive obedience lay in this, that he had a quick sense of the wrath of God due to sin into the very heart of him; and that, notwithstanding the natural sentiments of his humanity, which put him upon the desire of being excused, he yet with perfect submission went through all the sad stages of his bitter passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Yet now the world is grown to that pass, as if Religion were turn'd <hi>Stoicism,</hi> and stupidity were Christian Valour; that people generally take it for a kinde of bravery, to be insensible of God's


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105965:9"/>
Judgements, and to walk unconcern'd in the midst of publick or personal calamities: but sure those of this temper are no other, then such as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle tells us of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 31. <hi>Void of natural affection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus then <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s being in bitterness teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to be <hi>patient,</hi> and his complaining of it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows us to be <hi>sensible.</hi> And no marvel, that he complains, for 'twas not only bitterness, but <hi>great bitterness;</hi> both extensively over all parts, all over bitterness; and intensively, all kindes, all degrees of bitterness, and so as the Original doubles the word, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> one way in <hi>Hebrew</hi> to express the <hi>superlative<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

Now, why God does thus at any time with any of us, to make our conditions bitter and bitter again, to put in great bitterness, more bitter ingredients still; besides those reasons we gave before, (this inlarging the dose being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to perfect the cure) we have two or three more to offer: as first, to beat us quite off from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>. carnal and secular confidences; that being forc'd to let go our hold of all our worldly comforts, we may stick the closer to God in our dependences upon him. And that good <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s temper was a little too apt to be peccant in this, the next <hi>Chapter</hi> shews us, where out of <note n="*" place="margin">2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32. 26.

               </note> ostentation he shews <hi>Merodach-Baladan's</hi> Messengers, that came to


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105965:9"/>
congratulate his recovery, his <hi>treasury,</hi> and <hi>armoury,</hi> and <hi>spicery.</hi> And then to put the higher value upon the following mercy. How sweet would health <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>. be after such a bitter sickness? how soon are the pains and throws of Childe-birth forgotten for joy when the Man-childe is once born into the world? the greatness of the danger serving to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandize <note place="margin">S. <hi>John</hi> 16. 21.</note> and heighten the deliverance. And lastly to teach us a right estimate of our own graces, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>. of that interest we have in God. <hi>Great Saints must</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Obs.</note> 
               <hi>look for great afflictions.</hi> A more then ordinary strength requires a more then ordinary tryal. Every Childe, every Novice in Religion can digest a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle bitterness. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> is to be treated as a Man, to be put upon a becoming task. The Sons of <hi>Anak,</hi> and the <hi>Zanzummim</hi> are fit for such a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion as <hi>Joshua</hi> to incounter. Wherefore if God, who uses not to lay more upon us, then we are able to bear, has laid his hand heavy upon thee, has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased thy pains, and inraged thy smart: bear up, brave soul, be of good courage in thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts, be strong in the Lord when he calls thee forth to such hard service, grudge not to lay out that strength God has given thee to bear thee up and to bear thee out in the greatest endurances. Thus Holy <hi>Job,</hi> when the whole world was against him, the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and <hi>Sabeans,</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and his friends, and wife and all and God


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105965:10"/>
himself seem'd to be an indifferent looker on; bore himself up stoutly against them all; and by the power of God's Grace in him withstood the worst of Providences without him. The Saints are made glorious by their sufferings, and 'tis their great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions put the lustre upon their victorious Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, when patience has had its perfect work. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> was a man of great piety, and must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore meet with great bitterness. And this bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the next place is the greater too, because it comes in the place of <hi>Peace, Cujus ipsum nomen dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce est,</hi> as the great <hi>Orator</hi> tells us, whose very name is luscious in the mouth, and speaks sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>We say, Variety is delightful; and 'tis the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the sublunary world to be whirl'd about in perpetual vicifsitudes, to be as mutable and full of changes, as the Moon it self, who has the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over it. And I confess, that the day-break brings comfortable tidings after telling the Clocks of a tedious and restless night; the verdant Spring is welcome, that has been usher'd in by a hard Winter; and the Sun-shine shews pleasant, which follows a bitter storm: But on the contrary (which was <hi>Hezekiah's</hi> case here) out of a prosperous state to be tumbled into adversity, to have new trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles tread upon the heels of our peace, out of health to be thrown upon a bed of bitter sickness; this


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105965:10"/>
is a sad change, and must needs go to the heart of the stoutest and wisest: when the remembrance of their former good estate serves only to aggravate their present ills. Yet so it seems good to the all wise God to exercise his Children, to try their sincerity to the utmost, whether they have any by-ends in their service; whether their piety be real, or only a pretense; whether, when their conditions are alter'd, their resolutions will not change too, and when a storm comes, take to the hedge, and keep a dangerous persecuted profession company no longer; whether they will go along with their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, when it goes as Christ did to be crucified, or with the Disciples desert him and leave him to himself.

               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:105965:11"/>
               <hi>the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?</hi> as if he had said, Let me see that Man, or Devil, or Thing in the world, that can drive me from my just con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidences, and blessed assurances of God's love. And for death, he makes nothing of it, vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safes it not the mention, but in a <hi>parenthesis</hi> in the next verse; looks upon it as a meer scare-crow, a thing he has been used to, and now fears it not; but gets him upon a place of Scripture, and defies it; <hi>As it is written,</hi> sayes he, <hi>For thy sake we are killed all the day long, we are accounted as sheep for the slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> And then in the two last verses of that <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> 'tis as bravely by him resolv'd upon the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion; <hi>I am perswaded that neither death, nor life, nor Angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, Nor heighth, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</hi> So then for peace let bitterness come; nay, let great bitterness come; yet such a resolution will weather the point of the worst change.</p>
            <p>But yet to aggravate this change, there is another consideration still behinde; that 'twas by way of surprize; it came strangely and unexpectedly, <hi>Behold, for peace I had great bitterness.</hi> When Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture bids us <hi>behold,</hi> 'tis worth our while to stand and look about; and this word gives us this les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,

               <note n="*" place="margin">

We read in the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter</hi> before, that the Angel had discomfited the Assyrian Host, and that <hi>Sennacherib</hi> himself the Monarch was assassin'd by his Sons: which quit the King of <hi>Judah</hi> utterly of all apprehensions; he is wrapt up in security; yet see, he is no sooner rid of this fear, but another arrest is serv'd upon him: <hi>In those dayes,</hi> sayes the first verse of this Chapter, <hi>was Hezekiah sick unto death.</hi> There surprizes him a bile worse then <hi>Rabshakeh,</hi> sticks close to him, and sends him once more to his prayers. So apt are good men upon little respite to forget themselves. Judgement comes like a thief in the night, and steals upon us: it concerns us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to watch, and to set a good centry, that we may not be caught unawares. But alas! how do we generally sleep over our great concerns, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heed evils, till they befal us; which are with far more difficulty cured, then they might have been prevented? Nothing can be more dreadful, then when judgements give us a <hi>camisade,</hi> set upon

            <p>And still this <hi>affliction</hi> has a higher step, taking it in the spiritual sense, for the disquiet of minde, and <hi>trouble of Conscience,</hi> arising possibly from the sense of sin, or from the distrust of God's favour, in this his sickness; to which the deliverance with its improvement hath reference. <hi>Hezekiah's</hi> minde as well as body was fore; and the Bile was not so much, it should seem, in his side, as 'twas in's very heart. He had stitches and pains of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; and his inner man was more afflicted, then the outward; and his spirit labour'd under no less distempers then his flesh did. And this is sure a very afflictive condition; when not only the Cisterns of earthly comfort are filled with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Marah;</hi> but even the spring of consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from within, I mean a good conscience, runs in troubled streams of <hi>Meribah:</hi> when a godly man's thoughts work, and boyl, and, as the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man is compar'd by the <note n="*" place="margin">

The best of Saints are sometimes put upon these conflicts, to struggle under the burden of their sins, and the apprehension of wrath due to them: when God loosens and slacks their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, blots and obscures their evidences, staggers their assurances, fills them full of doubts, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities, and jealousies of their own estate; and so pursues them with legal terrors, that he drives them to fly before the face of the avenger, even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their City of Refuge, the Merits of <hi>Christ:</hi> and likely sickness is God's time of Visiting iniquity in this manner; and then sins come thick to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. The wicked and the godly may in this respect little differ in their outward Symptoms, as to the trouble and quiet of Conscience: but in the grounds of either there is a vast difference. The <hi>ungodly</hi> man, when his Conscience is awak'd with some rouzing judgement, is possest with the frightful foresights of unavoidable vengeance: the <hi>godly</hi> are troubled at God's displeasure, at the withdrawings of his favour, and the hidings of his countenance. The <hi>one</hi> has no Sanctuary to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take himself to; his troubles immerse him into the gulph of despair: the <hi>other</hi> when he is seiz'd with the arrests of the Law, can by Faith lay hold upon the terms of Evangelical mercy, and has a powerful advocate to plead for him, and a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent bail to fetch him off, even <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> the


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:105965:13"/>
Mediator of the Covenant. Nor again does their calm and tranquility of minde proceed from the same principle, or tend to the same practice; the <hi>wicked</hi> man's quiet proceeds from his carnal secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; his conscience is cast into a dead sleep, and becomes insensible, by a kinde of spiritual lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, that 'tis not so much want of trouble as want of sense; wherefore he still runs on securely in his sinful course: whereas the in ward peace, which a <hi>godly</hi> man enjoyes, arises from the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of pardon, and the sense of God's favour; and this puts him upon a careful walking with God, that he may not tempt him to remove his peace. And this his confidence in God, and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of his own integrity bears him up even in the midst of his dejections and disquiets; that, when he goes mourning all the day, when he feeds himself with his tears, and in great anxiety and distress pours out his soul within him, he can say with the Psalmist, <hi>Psal.</hi> XLII. and XLIII. <hi>Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope in God, for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance and my God.</hi> For he knows that however, when God has taken and pursu'd all his advantages against him, when he has laid load upon him, he is sure at last to give him a good issue out of the temptation, and, be his affliction what it will,


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:105965:13"/>
to procure him in the end a merciful <hi>Deliverance,</hi> which is our next Theme to treat of.</p>
            <p>And this a two-fold <hi>Deliverance,</hi> according to his two-fold distemper, <hi>Bodily,</hi> and <hi>Ghostly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His <hi>temporal</hi> affliction, his sickness, is cur'd by the temporal mercy of his recovery, that God has <hi>deliver'd his soul,</hi> i. e. his life, <hi>from the pit of corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,</hi> from the Grave: and his <hi>spiritual</hi> malady or trouble of conscience by that spiritual mercy, the pardon of his sins, that God had <hi>cast all his sins behinde his back.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, Here's the removal of his sickness, and the return of <hi>health;</hi> and then, to improve that, here's the removal of his sins, and the restitution of his <hi>peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Behold, for peace I had great bitterness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But thou hast in love to my soul deliver'd it from the pit of corruption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For thou hast cast all my sins behinde thy back.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou.</hi> 'twas Thou deliveredst me. He imputes his Recovery here wholly to God. Hence we learn, that <hi>God is the sole Author of all our deliverances.</hi> His <note place="margin">Obs.</note> sickness might have come by some casualty, might proceed from natural causes in the general way of a permissive providence: but to be sure, God had a special hand in the restauration. That was the effect, and a peculiar disposition of a particular


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:105965:14"/>
providence, and came with a <hi>Mandamus</hi> from heaven. I will not deny, but means may, and must be, and were here used; but then 'tis God's blessing that puts vertue into those means, and gives them an effectual operation. Practicioners of Physick will tell us, that a <hi>lump of Figs</hi> bruised and made up into a Plaister may be no unfit <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plasm</hi> to be applied toa plague sore, to help to ripen and break the Bile? yet here in this case 'twas God himself by his Prophet gave the <hi>Receipt,</hi> and in all cases virtuates and succeeds the means. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Syriack</hi> Interpreter transposes the two last Verses of this Chapter, setting the 22. verse before the 21. and that very appositely to the close of the <hi>Song</hi> in the 20th. <hi>verse,</hi> where he sayes he will <hi>Sing Songs to the tuned instruments all the dayes of his life in the house of the Lord. Now,</hi> as the <hi>Syriack</hi> brings it in, <hi>Hezekiah had said, What is the sign, that I shall go to the house of the Lord?</hi> That I shall go abroad again, and wait upon God in his Temple. <hi>And Isaias gave this answer,</hi> sayes he, <hi>Let them take a lump of Figs, and spread it upon the Bile.</hi> (Which verses in the common order they stand in, seem to be a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, out of their due place.) So that the <hi>Lump of Figs</hi> should according to this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter, be appointed here by God for a sign as well as a Plaister, nor only for a <hi>medicinal</hi> expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, but also for a <hi>Symbolical</hi> token. Thus it is in


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:105965:14"/>
all our troubles and afflictions, that befall us, be it what it will, or who it will, the malice of man or the Devil, Chance or Nature, our own negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence or indiscretion, that leads us on; 'tis God that brings us off; and as we pray, that he will not <hi>Lead us into temptation,</hi> (which he does but very rarely, and that only by way of permission) so we must pray to him alone to <hi>deliver us from all evil.</hi> And yet this is not intended to lessen our gratitude to too men, whose skill or care has af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded us any help in our distress, as being instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments under God for our good. And so the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> here no question was concern'd in the good <hi>King</hi>'s acknowledgements, and the very <hi>Recipe</hi> of Figs is fil'd up in the Records of Scripture.</p>
            <p>Further, besides the subordination, that men act as instruments, in what they do for us; God is the sole principal Agent: there is usually this difference too; that men, what kindeness or good office they may do us, they may do it for their own sake as well as ours; not out of love to our person so much, as for some by-respect and self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end. The Physician proportions his attendance to his fee; and scarce any the best friend we have will do ought for us for God-a-mercy. Some perhaps may by the sense of former obligations; but most by the expectation of a future reward are excited and mov'd to serve us. But all God's mercies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed

from pure love; <hi>out of love thou hast deliver'd me.</hi> I say, <hi>Divine mercy is gratuitous;</hi> it flows as <note place="margin">Obs.</note> free, as the light from the Sun, as the stream from the Spring. For alas! if we look into our selves, and consider how vile we are by nature, how more vile by sin; what can we finde in our selves, that may any way deserve the kinde respects, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate regards of an infinite and glorious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty? what, that may be lookt upon, as a fit object of Divine Love? Have not we just reason, the very best of us, with the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> to hold up our hands in admiration, and bless our selves, saying, <note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>What is man that thou art mindeful of him,</hi> or takest any knowledge of him? <hi>or the son of man, that thou visitest him,</hi> that thou makest any account of him? He doth not want us, nor is our goodness any thing to him: neither can our welfare adde ought to his infinite glories, nor our miscarriage substract ought from them. It is our duty and our happiness to boot, to serve him; nor is he a whit obliged to us: when we have done all we ought to do, we are to him still <hi>unprofitable Servants.</hi> If we are good, we are good to our selves; and if we are otherwise, we shall have the worst on't, And yet to see, how all his thoughts and cares run upon us, how he has made man the darling of heaven, and the charge of Angels; what blessings he daily dispenses among us, and what uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:105965:15"/>
good things he has prepar'd for us, if we will but fit our selves for them; how his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence waits upon us at our up-rising, and our down-lying, and in all our wayes constantly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends us, and takes that particular care of us, that he has the very hairs of his head <hi>in numerato;</hi> will abundantly convince us of his undeserved love to us, and of that love we owe to him again.

If God so freely love us, how ought we to love one another, and to help one another with all kinde of courtesie and assistance? but above all, in a due imitation of Divine Charity, not to let it be a carnal affection, or express it only in ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the outward man; but to improve it spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, that it may be a love from the soul, and a love to the soul of one another.</p>

               <hi>Beloved, I wish above things, that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereth.</hi> Let worldlings think what they will; our health and prosperity is, as our soul prospers and does well: All our worldly enjoyments, unless we have the art to spiritualize them, and can by grace make them serviceable to our souls, are but dry chips, and can afford no true real comfort. The

very <hi>Breasts</hi> of providence, from whence our peace, plenty, liberty, and all outward blessings flow, without this are but <hi>Winde-bags,</hi> and those that draw them most, will finde they get nothing but vanity and emptiness, fill themselves with vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and distemper; if God by his Grace do not sanctifie his providences to the good of their souls. This is that, which makes blessings to be blessings indeed. And indeed God does design all his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral mercies to our spiritual advantage, if we would but comply with his designs. And thus it was here with <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> whose soul was repriev'd from the Grave at once, and preserv'd from Hell; for <hi>the pit of corruption</hi> in Scripture-style signifies both; from the Grave by his recovery, and from Hell by his pardon.</p>
            <p>To take the words in either of those senses, or in both; what a mercy of God is it to us all, to every one of us, that are here this day, that we are yet on this side Hell, yet on this side the Grave? and what care are we oblig'd to in our walking, when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that <hi>All our life-time we walk upon the pit-brink?</hi>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:105965:17"/>
mouth of such a dangerous pit, where 'tis so easie falling in, and impossible to get out again? And yet, O desperate folly! most people of the world are thus mad, pursuing the seeming sweets of a momentany life to the hazard of an eternal ruine, and the irreparable loss of their immortal souls. I have heard a story, and I suppose many of you have heard it too, of a man, that travelling late, and being in drink, rode over a narrow foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Bridge, where there was a great deep water un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath, that the least trip of the Horses foot would have posted the rider to his long home: next morning, when he was come to himself, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing askt which way he came, and brought to the place, the apprehension of his last nights adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture did so surprize and astonish his sober thoughts, that he fell down dead in the very place at the sight on't. And when we look back upon the follies and vanities of our past lives, how can we but be justly startled, when almost every step we have trod, has been upon the pit's brink of destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Those especially, whose desires seem to be as bottomless as this pit is, who cry, <hi>Give, give,</hi> and never think they have enough, and are immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in heaping up this world's goods; may look upon this pit as a stop in their career: when they sit down and consider, that within a score or two of years hence, very likely in less time, all their

Thus mercies grow like clusters in the vineyards of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaddi,</hi> A great incouragement for prayer, which makes such ample returns. The best Husbandry we can use, to improve our selves, by praying of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. A great comfort this too, to any good man upon the bed of sickness; that God will both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover and pardon him, both restore him to health and accept him to favour. Thus our <hi>Saviour</hi> in those Miracles of Mercy he shew'd upon the bodies of men, was wont to regard their souls too, and wrought cures both upon the outward and inward man: as he did to the <hi>Paralytick,</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing first, <hi>*Thy sins are forgiven thee;</hi> then, <hi>Rise,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">S. <hi>Mark</hi> 2. 9.</note> 
               <hi>take up thy bed, and walk.</hi> Thus easing him first of the heavy load of his sins, and then inabling him to bear the lighter burthen of his couch.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Pardon of sins is the complement and perfection of mercy.</hi> His recovery without this would have <note place="margin">Obs.</note> done him little good, and the renewing of his Lease have serv'd only for an opportunity of run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning farther on the score, and so of making his condition much worse then it had been. O infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely happy that man, even in this life, whose sins are forgiven him! all his enjoyments must needs have a pleasant relish; whereas to the wicked


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:105965:18"/>
this <hi>Coloquintida,</hi> the rank <hi>Hogo,</hi> which unpardon'd sin gives them, spoils all their comforts, and makes their condition, be it never so spangled and glorious, never so gay and jaunty to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward shew, troublesome and vexatious within; like the Emperour's <hi>Ermin-Cap,</hi> richly lin'd with pricking cares, and cutting fears: of which our good King had now clear'd both his Head and Crown; for he had God's promise that neither the <hi>Assyrian</hi> should assault his Kingdom, nor <hi>Satan</hi> his soul.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>He, whose sins are forgiven, needs not fear hell or the grave. Hezekiah</hi> here is assured, that God <note place="margin">Obs.</note> had deliver'd his soul from the pit of corruption, because he had cast all his sins behinde his back. <hi>The righteous man,</hi> say the <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>Lastly, <hi>God's pardons are universal and absolute.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Obs.</note> They are all his sins; and all cast behinde God's back, never more to be remembred. God pardons

totally and finally, not by halves or half way, but wholly and out-right; he forgives and forgets. We are too too apt to throw our sins behinde our own back, and to take no notice of them; our great concern is to get them cast behinde God's back. O let us prize this pardoning Grace of God's; endeavour to obtain it by confessing and forsaking our sins; and especially in the time of sickness, or any other affliction, when God's hand lies upon us, to make our humble and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest supplications then to the blessed Spirit, to bring home to our soul this comfort; to renew our repentance, and to re-inforce our resolutions; and having obtain'd forgiveness, never by any fresh wilful acts of sin to forfeit the comfort of such an assurance.</p>
            <p>Thus have we seen <hi>Hezekiah</hi> Afflicted, Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, Pardon'd: we are now in the last place come to his <hi>Thanksgiving,</hi> and <hi>Acknowledgement,</hi> and that, as I noted before, set down.</p>

               <hi>For the Grave cannot praise thee,</hi> &amp;c. which words will help us to several useful observations.</p>

               <note place="margin">Obs.</note> 
               <hi>God expects for his mercies is Praise.</hi> This is given here as the reason of this his deliverance; <hi>FOR the Grave cannot praise thee; the living shall.</hi> God the <hi>Jehovah</hi> being an Infinite Being, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, in his Essence and Actions, independent of any other being, can have no Principle or End of his Actions without him. As in a Circle, the whole round being in it self compleat, the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and end meet but in an imaginary point, and admit not of a real distinction. And such a Circle is God, which comprehends all things, and is it self not comprehended. Wherefore he can have no other principle, but himself; no other end, but himself, in all that he does or designs. He is the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega;</hi>

               <hi>From him and to him are all things.</hi> He acts all freely from his own will, and wisely to his own glory: and in this manner we his creatures are to act, if we will act regularly, from him and to him. He is, as the supreme cause which excites and impowers all subordinate agents to act; so the Chiefest Good too, in which all their actions should terminate. And in this subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion all other creatures, in their several spheres of activity, comply with the rule and method of their Creator: man only to his shame stands out, who


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:105965:20"/>
has most reason to be, and to act like his God, wearing his Image. Good and pious men how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever do endeavour after this, which is their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; to live by the power to the praise of God, that is, to act by his Grace to his Glory. Should God require any greater matter of us, as <note n="*" place="margin">2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's</hi> servants tell him, when we lie on the bed of sickness, when we are incompass'd with distresses, would not we have done it? and when for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance all, that he looks for at our hands, is praise only; he must be of an extraordinary dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuous impiety, that should refuse to testifie his thanks in so cheap a Sacrifice. This civility we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not to men; 'tis a Physician's reputation, when his patient recovers; and we usually, besides his Salary, allow him our good word. Let not us grudge God the honour of a poor acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>praising</hi> and <hi>celebrating God,</hi> and <hi>hoping for his truth, (his mercy,</hi> say the <hi>LXX; his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> the Chaldee Paraphrast) are here made <hi>Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyma's,</hi> to mean the same thing. If so, then a generous trust in God's mercy is the right celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. <hi>To trust in God is to praise him.</hi> I have <note place="margin">Obs.</note> been afflicted; God has deliver'd me; I praise him for it: how? by trusting that he will still deliver me. I have been exercised with grievous sickness; God has visited me with his loving kindeness: I come to


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:105965:20"/>
return him due praise for his goodness: how? by entertaining and professing a just confidence in God, that he will never fail me, never leave me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute. And this, as 'tis a comfortable, so 'tis a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and a natural duty. We ordinarily do it to men: when we have had tryals of their fidelity in matters of any moment, we stick not to trust them farther, and by so doing recommend their honest just dealing to the world. Shall we not much more do so to God? whose mercy and faithfulness we have so often experimented, when no one could help us out but He He that distrusts God, scandalizes his goodness, and calls his truth in question. <hi>David</hi> is not asham'd to make one of the first and earliest acts of God's common provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence towards him, when he was an infant, an argument of his trusting God his whole life after. <note n="*" place="margin">

It will be the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and imploy of our eternity to praise him; and we must aforehand acquaint our selves with it, and so practice this lesson here, that we may be found worthy to wait upon the <hi>Lamb,</hi> and sing <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> in heaven.

Further, consider what this <hi>life</hi> of ours is; 'tis but a breath We must begin this task then out of hand, presently. There's nothing of our life ours, but the present, the <hi>Nunc instans,</hi> this very instant of time.

               <hi>We bless thee for all those opportunities and advantages, thou hast so liberally afforded us, of serving thee, and of saving our own souls; that, if we miscarry either in this world or the next, 'tis not thou by thy grace or thy providence hast been wanting to us, but we have been wanting both to thee and to our selves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, we return thee our hearty thanks, and praise thy name, for all those afflictions, thou hast at any time laid upon us, and for thy merciful deliverances out of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That, when thou hast visited our iniquities, and</hi>


               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:105965:24"/>
               <hi>chastn'd us for sin, thou hast not dealt with us after our sins, nor rewarded us according to our iniquities, but hast remembred mercy in the midst of judgment, and hast pitied us like as a father pitieth his children; (for thou knowest our frame, thou remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brest that we are but dust.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That thou hast laid no more upon us at any time, then we were inabled by thee well to bear, and by thy grace hast supported us in our sufferings; and that, when thou hast seen fit to put any bitterness into our cup, thou hast design'd it for our soul's health, and to a spiritual advantage; and lastly, that together with the temptation thou hast given a gracious and happy issue out of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And here we humbly intreat thee, O Father of mercies, to accept the thanksgiving of every particular person in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, for all thy favours and merciful deliverances vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed them through the course of their whole lives; and more especially be graciously pleased to accept the thanks of that thy servant, who being by thy gracious providence recover'd of a grievous and dangerous sickness, this day in thy house presents his offering of praise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Grant, that both he and all of us may have that his sickness and all our afflictions so sanctified, and this his recovery and all our deliverances so improv'd to him and to us, that we may ill be fully assur'd, that out of love to our souls thou hast deliver'd them from the pit of corruption, and that thou hast cast all our sins behind thy back.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus shall our meditation of thee be sweet; we will be glad in the Lord, and rejoyce in thy salvation, who forgivest all our iniquities, and healest all our diseases, and redeemest our life from destruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Who hidest not thy face from us in the day of trouble, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardest the prayer of the destitute: who lookest down from the height of thy sanctuary, to hear the groaning of those that are confin'd, and to deliver them that are appointed unto death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To declare the name of the Lord in his temple, and his praise</hi>


               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:105965:24"/>
               <hi>in the great assembly, when the people are gather'd together to serve the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let us give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name: Let us bring our offerings, and come into his courts: Let us sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord hath chasten'd us sore, but he hath not given us over unto death. We shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the Lord. Thou art our God, and we will praise thee: thou art our God, and we will exalt thee. Let us give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The voice of rejoycing and salvasion is in the tabernacles of the righteous. The Lord taketh pleasure in them that fear him; in those that hope in his mercy. O Lord, our hope is in thee; Let us never be confounded.</hi>
