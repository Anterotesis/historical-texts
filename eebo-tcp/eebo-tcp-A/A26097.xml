         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THeſe Reflections being made in the
Country, where the Book that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd
them came but late to Hand, the
<hi>Reader</hi> is deſir'd to excuſe their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs
as well as other Faults; and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that they have no other Deſign than
to Correct ſome Abuſes, which are not the
leſs becauſe Power and Preſcription ſeem to
Authorize them. If any is ſo needleſly cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
as to enquire from what Hand they
come, they may pleaſe to know, that it is
not good Manners to ask, ſince the Title-Page
does not tell them: We are all of us
ſufficiently Vain, and without doubt the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated
Name of <hi>Author,</hi> which most are
ſo fond of, had not been avoided but for
very good Reaſons: To name but one; <hi>Who
will care to pull upon themſelves an Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net's
Neſt?</hi> 'Tis a very great Fault to
regard rather who it is that Speaks,
than what is ſpoken; and either to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to Authority, when we ſhould only
<pb facs="tcp:93658:3"/>
yield to Reaſon; or if Reaſon preſs too
hard, to think to ward it off by Perſonal
Objections and Reflections. Bold Truths
may paſs while the Speaker is <hi>Incognito,</hi>
but are ſeldom endur'd when he is known;
few Minds being ſtrong enough to bear
what contradicts their Principles and
Practices without recriminating when they
can. And tho' to tell the Truth be the
most Friendly Office, yet whoſoever is ſo
hardy as to venture at it, ſhall be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
an Enemy for ſo doing.</p>

            <head>SOME
REFLECTIONS
UPON
MARRIAGE,
Occaſion'd by the Duke and Dutcheſs
of Mazarine's CASE; which is
alſo conſider'd.</head>
            <p>CUrioſity, which is ſometimes an
occaſion of Good, and too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
of Miſchief, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbing
either our Own, or
our Neighbour's Repoſe, having put me
upon reading <hi>the Duke and Dutcheſs of</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarine<hi>'s
Caſe;</hi> I thought an Afternoon
wou'd not be quite thrown away in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing
ſome Reflections that it occaſion'd.
The name of <hi>Mazarine</hi> is conſiderable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93658:4"/>
to draw the Eyes of the curious,
and when one remembers what a noiſe it
had made in <hi>Europe,</hi> what Politick Schemes
have been laid, what vaſt deſigns brought
about by the Cardinal that bore it; how
well his meaſures were concerted for the
Grandeur of that Nation, into which he
was tranſplanted, and that he wanted
neither Power nor Inclination to eſtabliſh
his own Family and make it as conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
as any Subjects could poſſible be,
and what Honours and Riches he had
heap'd together in order to this, one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but enquire how it comes about that
he ſhould be ſo defeated in this laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign;
and that thoſe to whom he intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
his Name and Treaſure, ſhould
make a figure ſo very different from what
might have been expected from them.
And tho' one had not Piety enough to
make a Religious Reflection, yet Civil
Prudence woul'd almoſt enforce them to
ſay, that <hi>Man being in Honour has no <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
but is compar'd unto the Beaſts
that Periſh.</hi> He bleſſeth his Soul, and
thinks himſelf a happy Man, imagining
his Houſe will endure for ever, and that
he has eſtabliſh'd his Name and Family.
But how wiſe ſoever he may be in other
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93658:4"/>
reſpects, in this he acts no better than the
Ignorant and Fooliſh. For as he carries
nothing away with him when he dies, ſo
neither will his Pomp and Glory deſcend
as he intended. Generous and Worthy
Actions only can ſecure him from Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion,
or what is worſe, being remembred
with Contempt; ſo little reaſon have we
to envy any Man's Wealth and Greatneſs,
but much to Emulate his Wiſdom and
Vertue.</p>
            <p>The Dutcheſs of <hi>Mazarine</hi>'s Name has
ſpread perhaps as far as her Uncle's, and
one can't help wiſhing that ſo much Wit
and Beauty, ſo much Politeneſs and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs,
had been accompany'd and ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by more valuable and laſting Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
one cannot but deſire that her Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate
inſtead of recriminating had clear'd
the imputations laid on her, and that ſhe
her ſelf, who ſays enough in her Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs,
to ſhew ſhe was unfortunate, had
ſaid more to prove her ſelf diſcreet. They
muſt be highly ill-natur'd who do not
pity her ill fortune at the ſame time that
they muſt blame her Conduct, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret
that ſuch a Treaſure ſhould fall into
his hands who was not worthy of it, nor
knew how to value and improve it; that
ſhe who was capable of being a great
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93658:5"/>
Ornament to her Family and Bleſſing to
the Age ſhe liv'd in, ſhould only ſerve (to
ſay no worſe) as an unhappy Shipwrack
to point out the dangers of an ill Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and unequal Marriage.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>Mazarine</hi> is not to be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
nor Madam his Spouſe excus'd. It
is no queſtion which is moſt Criminal,
the having no ſenſe, or the abuſe of a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral
Portion, nor any hard matter to
determine who is moſt to be pity'd, he
whom Nature never qualify'd for great
things, who therefore can't be very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of great Misfortunes; or ſhe, who
being capable of every thing, muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſuffer more and be the more lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
To be yoak'd for Life to a diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
Perſon and Temper, to have
Folly and Ignorance tyrannize over Wit
and Senſe; to be contradicted in every
thing one does or ſays, and bore
down not by Reaſon but Authority; to
be denied ones moſt innocent deſires for
no other cauſe, but the Will and Pleaſure
of an abſolute Lord and Maſter, whoſe
follies a Woman with all her Prudence
cannot hide, and whoſe Commands ſhe
cannot but deſpiſe at the ſame time ſhe
obeys them, is a miſery none can have a
juſt Idea of, but thoſe who have felt it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:93658:5"/>
Theſe are great Provocations, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can juſtify the revenging the Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
we receive from others, upon our
ſelves: The <hi>Italian</hi> Proverb ſhews much
better way <hi>Vuoi far vendetta del tuo nemico
governati bene. If you would be reveng'd of
your Enemies, live well.</hi> Had Madam <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarine</hi>'s
Education made a right improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of her Wit and Senſe, we ſhould
not have found her ſeeking Relief by ſuch
imprudent, not to ſay Scandalous Methods,
as the running away in Diſguiſe with a
ſpruce Cavalier, and rambling to ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Courts and Places, nor diverting her
ſelf with ſuch Childiſh, Ridiculous or
Ill-natur'd Amuſements, as the greateſt
part of the Adventures in her Memoirs
are made up of. True wit conſiſts not
meerly in doing or ſaying what is out of
the way, but in ſuch ſurprizing things
as are fit and becoming the Perſon from
whom they come. That which ſtirs us
up to Laughter moſt commonly excites
our Contempt: to Pleaſe, and to make
Merry are two very different Talents.
But what Remedies can be adminiſtred,
what Relief expected, when Devotion, the
only true ſupport in Diſtreſs, is turn'd into
Ridicule? Unhappy is that Grandeur
which makes us too great to be good; and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93658:6"/>
that Wit which ſets us at a diſtance from
true Wiſdom. Even Bigotry it ſelf, as
contemptible as it is, is preferable to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
Wit; for that only requires our Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but this deſerves our Abhorrence.</p>
            <p>A Woman who ſeeks Conſolation under
Domeſtick troubles from the Gaieties of a
Court, from Gaming and Courtſhip, from
Rambling and odd Adventures, and the
Amuſements mixt Company affords, may
Plaiſter up the Sore, but will never heal it;
nay, which is worſe, ſhe makes it Feſter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
a poſſibility of Cure. She juſtifies the
Injury her Husband has done her, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that whatever other good Qualities
ſhe may have, Diſcretion, one of the
Principal, is wanting. She may be Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
but ſhe can never prove ſhe is ſo;
all that Charity can do for her when ſhe's
Cenſur'd is only to be ſilent; it can make
no Apologies for ſuſpicious Actions. An
ill Husband may deprive a Wife of the
comfort and quiet of her Life; may give
her occaſion of exerciſing her Virtue, may
try her Patience and Fortitude to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt,
but that's all he can do: 'tis her ſelf
only can accompliſh her Ruin. Had Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>Mazarin's</hi> Reſerve been what it ought
to be, Monſieur <hi>Herard</hi> needed not to
have warded off ſo carefully, the nice
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93658:6"/>
Subject of the Lady's Honour, nor her
Advocate have ſtrain'd ſo hard for Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
to excuſe ſuch Actions as will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bear 'em; but a Man indeed ſhews the
beſt ſide of his Wit, tho' the worſt of
his Integrity, when he has an ill Cauſe to
manage. Truth is bold and vehement;
ſhe depends upon her own ſtrength, and
ſo ſhe be plac'd in a true Light, thinks
it not neceſſary to uſe Artifice and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
as a Recommendation; but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices
of Men have made them neceſſary:
their Imagination gets the better of their
Underſtanding, and more judge according
to Appearances, than ſearch after the
Truth of Things.</p>
            <p>What an ill Figure does a Woman
make with all the Charms of her Beauty
and Sprightlineſs of her Wit, with all
her good Humour and inſinuating Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs;
tho' ſhe be the beſt Oeconomiſt
in the World, the moſt entertaining Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation;
if ſhe remit her Guard, abate
in the Severity of her Caution and Strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of her Virtue, and neglect thoſe
Methods which are neceſſary to keep her
not only from a Crime, but from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſuſpicion of one!</p>
            <p>Are the being forbid having Comedies
in her Houſe, an ill natur'd Jeſt, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93658:7"/>
of a Servant, impoſing Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks,
or frequent changing them, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Reaſons to Authorize a Woman's lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
her Husband and breaking from the
ſtrongeſt Bands, expoſing her ſelf to
Temptations and Injuries from the Bad,
to the contempt, or at the beſt to the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Good, and the juſt Cenſure of
all? A Woman of ſenſe one would think
ſhould take little ſatisfaction in the Cringes
and Courtſhip of her Adorers, even when
ſhe is ſingle; but it is Criminal in a Wife
to admit them, intereſted Perſons may
call it Gallantry, but with the modeſt
and diſcreet it is like to have a harder
Name, or elſe Gallantry will paſs for a
ſcandalous thing, not to be allow'd among
Vertuous Perſons.</p>
            <p>But Madam <hi>Mazarine</hi> is dead, may her
Faults die with her; may there be no more
occaſion given for the like Adventures,
or if there is, may the Ladies be more
Wiſe and Good than to take it! Let us
ſee then from whence the miſchief pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds,
and try if it can be prevented;
certainly Man may be very happy in a
Married State; 'tis his own fault if he is
at any time otherwiſe. The wiſe Inſtitutor
of Matrimony never did any thing in
vain; we are the Sots and Fools if what
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93658:7"/>
he deſign'd for our Good, be to us an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of falling. For Marriage, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all the looſe talk of the Town,
the Satyrs of Ancient or Modern preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to Wit, will never loſe its due praiſe
from judicious Perſons. Tho' much may
be ſaid againſt this or that Match, tho'
the Ridiculouſneſs of ſome, the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs,
of others and Imprudence of too
many, too often provoke our wonder or
ſcorn, our indignation or pity, yet Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
in general is too ſacred to be trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with Diſreſpect, too venerable to be
the ſubject of Raillery and Buffonery. It
is the Inſtitution of Heaven, the only
Honourable way of continuing Mankind,
and far be it from us to think there could
have been a better than infinite Wiſdom
has found out for us.</p>
            <p>But upon what are the Saytrs againſt
Marriage grounded? Not upon the State
it ſelf, if they are juſt, but upon the ill
Choice, or fooliſh Conduct of thoſe who
are in it, and what has Marriage, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
in its ſelf, to do with that? Let
every Man bear his own Burden: If
through inordinate Paſſion, Raſhneſs,
Humour, Pride, Coveteouſneſs, or any
the like Folly, a Man makes an Impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Choice, Why ſhould Marriage be
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93658:8"/>
exclaim'd againſt? Let him blame him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
for entering into an unequal Yoke,
and making Choice of one who perhaps
may prove a Burthen, a Diſgrace and
Plague, inſtead of a Help and Comfort
to him. Could there be no ſuch thing as
an happy Marriage, Arguments againſt
Marriage would hold good, but ſince
the thing is not only poſſible, but even
very probable, provided we take but
competent Care, Act like wiſe Men and
Chriſtians, and acquit our ſelves as we
ought, all we have to ſay againſt it ſerves
only to ſhew the levity or impiety of our
own Minds, we can only make ſome flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes
of Wit, tho' ſcarce without Injuſtice,
and tho' we talk prettily it is but very little
to the purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Is it the being ty'd to <hi>One</hi> that offends
us? Why this ought rather to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
it to us, and would really do ſo,
were we guided by Reaſon, and not by
Humour or brutiſh Paſſion. He who does
not make Friendſhip the chief induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to his Choice, and prefer it before
any other conſideration, does not deſerve
a good Wife, and therefore ſhould not
complain if he goes without one. Now
we can never grow weary of our Friends;
the longer we have had them the more
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93658:8"/>
they are endear'd to us; and if we have One
well aſſur'd, we need ſeek no farther, but are
ſufficiently happy in Her. The love of
Variety in this and in other caſes, ſhews
only the ill Temper of our own Mind, we
ſeek for <hi>ſettled</hi> Happineſs in this preſent
World; where it is not to be found, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of being Content with a competent
ſhare, chearfully enjoying and being
thankful for the Good that is afforded us,
and patiently bearing with the Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
that attend it.</p>
            <p>The Chriſtian Inſtitution of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
provides the beſt that may be for Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick
Quiet and Content, and for the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation
of Children; ſo that if we were
not under the tye of Religion, even the
Good of Society and civil Duty would
oblige us to what that requires at our
Hands. And ſince the very beſt of us
are but poor frail Creatures, full of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
and Infirmity, ſo that in Juſtice we
ought to tolerate each other, and exerciſe
that Patience towards our Companions to
Day, which we give them occaſion to ſhew
towards us to Morrow, the more we are
accuſtom'd to any one's Converſation, the
better ſhall we underſtand their Humour,
be more able to comply with their
Weakneſs and leſs offended at it: For he
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93658:9"/>
who would have every one ſubmit to his
Humours and will not in his turn com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with them, tho' we ſhould ſuppoſe
him always in the Right, whereas a Man
of this temper very ſeldom is ſo, he's not
fit for a Husband, ſcarce fit for Society,
but ought to be turn'd out of the Herd to
live by himſelf.</p>
            <p>There may indeed be inconveniencies
in a Married Life; but is there any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
without them? And he who lives
ſingle, that he may indulge Licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and give up himſelf to the conduct of
wild and ungovern'd Deſires, or indeed
out of any other inducement, than the
Glory of GOD and the Good of his Soul,
through the proſpect he has of doing
more Good, or becauſe his frame and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of Mind are fitted for it, may
rail as he pleaſes againſt Matrimony, but
can never juſtifie his own Conduct, nor
clear it from the imputation of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Folly.</p>
            <p>But if Marriage be ſuch a bleſſed
State, how comes it, may you ſay, that
there are ſo few happy Marriages? Now
in anſwer to this, it is not to be wonder'd
that ſo few ſucceed, we ſhould rather be
ſurpriz'd to find ſo many do, conſidering
how imprudently Men engage, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93658:9"/>
they act by, and the very ſtrange
Conduct they obſerve throughout.</p>
            <p>For pray, what do Men propoſe to
themſelves in Marriage? What Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
do they look after in a Spouſe?
What will ſhe bring is the firſt enquiry?
How many Acres? Or how much ready
Coin? Not that this is altogether an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary
Queſtion, for Marriage with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Competency, that is not only a
bare Subſiſtence, but even a handſome
and plentiful Proviſion, according to the
Quality and Circumſtances of the Parties,
is no very comfortable Condition. They
who Marry for Love as they call it, find
time enough to repent their raſh Folly,
and are not long in being convinc'd, that
whatever fine Speeches might be made in
the heat of Paſſion, there could be no <hi>real
Kindneſs</hi> between thoſe who can agree to
make each other miſerable. But as an
Eſtate is to be conſider'd, ſo it ſhould not
be the <hi>Main,</hi> much leſs the <hi>Only</hi> conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
for Happineſs does not depend on
Wealth, that may be wanting, and too
often is, where this abounds. He who Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
himſelf to a Fortune only, muſt expect
no other ſatisfaction than that can bring
him, but let him not ſay that Marriage,
but his own Covetous or Prodigal Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93658:10"/>
has made him unhappy. What Joy
has that Man in all his Plenty, who muſt
either run from home to poſſeſs it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to all the Rules of Juſtice, to the
Laws of GOD and Man; nay, even in
oppoſition to Good nature, and Good
breeding too, which ſome Men make
more account of than all the reſt; or elſe
be forc'd to ſhare it with a Woman whoſe
Perſon or Temper is diſagreeable, whoſe
preſence is ſufficient to four all his Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and if he have any remains of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
or Good manners, he muſt ſuffer the
uneaſineſs of a continual watch, to force
himſelf to a conſtrain'd Civility!</p>
            <p>Few Men have ſo much Goodneſs as to
bring themſelves to a liking of what they
loath'd, meerly becauſe it is their Duty
to like; on the contrary, when they
Marry with an indifferency, to pleaſe
their Friends or encreaſe their Fortune,
the indifferency proceeds to an averſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and perhaps even the kindneſs and
complaiſance of the poor abus'd Wife
ſhall only ſerve to encreaſe it. What fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
then? There is no content at home,
ſo it is ſought elſewhere, and the Fortune
ſo unjuſtly got, is as careleſsly ſquander'd.
The Man takes a looſe, what ſhou'd hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him? He has all in his hands, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93658:10"/>
Cuſtom has almoſt taken off that ſmall
Reſtraint Reputation us'd to lay. The
Wife finds too late what was the Idol
the Man adored, which her Vanity per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
or it may be the Commands and
Importunities of Relations, wou'd not let
her ſee before; and now he has got that
into his poſſeſſion, ſhe muſt make court
to him for a little ſorry Alimony out of
her own Eſtate. If Diſcretion and Piety
prevails upon her Paſſions ſhe ſits down
quietly, contented with her lot, ſeeks no
Conſolation in the Multitude of Adorers,
ſince he whom only ſhe deſir'd to pleaſe,
becauſe it was her duty to do ſo, will take
no delight in her Wit or Beauty: She
follows no Diverſion to allay her Grief,
uſes no Cordials to ſupport her Spirit, that
may ſully her Vertue or bring a Cloud
upon her Reputation, ſhe makes no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals
to the miſ-judging Croud, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mentions her Misfortunes to her
moſt intimate Acquaintance, nor lays
a load on her Husband to eaſe her ſelf,
but wou'd if it were poſſible conceal his
Crimes, tho' her Prudence and Vertue
give him a thouſand reproaches without
her Intention or knowledge; and retiring
from the World, ſhe ſeeks a more ſolid
Comfort than that can give her, taking
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93658:11"/>
care to do nothing that Cenſoriouſneſs
or even Malice it ſelf can miſconſtrue to
her prejudice. Now ſhe puts on all her
Reſerves, and thinks even Innocent Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
ſcarce allowable in her Diſconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
State; ſhe has other Buſineſs to mind:
Nor does ſhe in her Retirements reflect ſo
much upon the hand that adminiſters this
bitter Cup, as conſider what is the beſt
uſe ſhe can make of it. And thus indeed
Marriage, however unfortunate in other
reſpects, becomes a very great Bleſſing to
her: She might have been expoſed to all
the Temptations of a plentiful Fortune,
have given up her ſelf to Sloth and Luxury,
and gone on at the common rate, even of
the better ſort, in doing no hurt, and as
little good. But now her kind Husband
obliges her to <hi>Conſider,</hi> and gives oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to exerciſe her Vertue; he makes
it neceſſary to withdraw from thoſe Gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Pleaſures of Life, which do more
miſchief under the ſhew of Innocency,
than they cou'd if they appear'd attended
with a Crime; diſcompoſing and diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the mind, and making it uncapable
of any manner of good; to be ſure of any
thing Great and Excellent. Silence and
Solitude, the being forc'd from the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Entertainments of her Station, may
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93658:11"/>
perhaps ſeem a deſolate condition at firſt,
and we may allow her, poor weak Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man!
to be ſomewhat ſhock'd at it, ſince
even a wiſe and courageous Man perhaps
would not keep his ground; we would
conceal if we could for the Honour of the
Sex, Men's being baffled and diſpirited by
a ſmaller Matter, were not the Inſtances
too frequent and too notorious.</p>
            <p>But a little time wears off all the uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and puts her in poſſeſſion of Pleaſures,
which till now ſhe has unkindly been kept a
ſtranger to. Affliction, the ſincereſt Friend,
the frankeſt Monitor, the beſt Inſtructer
and indeed the only uſeful School that
Women are ever put to, rouſes her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
opens her Eyes, fixes her
Attention, and diffuſes ſuch a Light, ſuch
a Joy into her Mind, as not only In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
her better, but entertains her more
than ever her <hi>Ruel</hi> did, tho' crouded by
the Men of Wit. She now diſtinguiſhes
between Truth and Appearances, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
ſolid and apparent Good; has
found out the inſtability of all Earthly
Things, and won't any more be deceiv'd
by relying on them; can diſcern who are
the Flatterers of her Fortune, and who
the Admirers and Encouragers of her
Vertue; accounting it no little bleſſing to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93658:12"/>
be rid of thoſe Leeches, who only hung
upon her for their own Advantage. Now
ſober Thoughts ſucceed to hurry and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence,
to Forms and Ceremony, ſhe
can ſecure her Time, and knows how to
Improve it; never truly a Happy Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
till ſhe came in the Eye of the World
to be reckon'd miſerable.</p>
            <p>Thus the Husband's Vices may become
an occaſion of the Wife's Vertues, and
his neglect do her a more real Good than
his Kindneſs could. But all injur'd Wives
don't behave themſelves after this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion,
nor can their Husbands juſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
it. With what Face can he blame
her for following his Example, and being
as extravagant on the one Hand, as he is
on the other? Tho' ſhe cannot juſtifie her
Exceſſes to GOD, to the World, nor to
her ſelf, yet ſurely in reſpect of him they
may admit of an excuſe. For to all the reſt
of his Abſurdities, (for Vice is always un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable,)
he adds one more, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
that Vertue from another which he
won't practiſe himſelf.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe a Man does not Marry for
Money, tho' for one that does not, perhaps
there are thouſands that do; let him Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for Love, and Heroick Action, which
makes a mighty noiſe in the World, partly
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93658:12"/>
becauſe of its rarity, and partly in regard
of its extravagancy, and what does his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
for Love amount to? There's no
great odds between his Marrying for the
Love of Money, or for the Love of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the Man does not Act according to
Reaſon in either Caſe; but is govern'd
by irregular Appetites. But he loves her
Wit perhaps, and this you'l ſay is more
Spiritual, more Refin'd; not at all if you
examine it to the Bottom. For what is
that which now adays paſſes under the
name of Wit? A bitter and ill-natur'd
Raillery, a pert Repartée, or a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
talking at all, and in ſuch a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Words, it's odds if ſomething or
other does not paſs that is ſurprizing, tho'
every thing that ſurprizes does not pleaſe;
ſome things are wonder'd at for their ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
as well as others for their Beauty.
True Wit, durſt one venture to deſcribe
it, is quite another thing, it conſiſts in
ſuch a Sprightlineſs of Imagination, ſuch a
reach and turn of thought, ſo properly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt,
as ſtrikes and pleaſes a judicious Taſt.
For tho' as one ſays of Beauty, <hi>'tis in
no Face but in the Lover's Mind,</hi> ſo it may
be ſaid of ſome ſorts of Wit, it is not in
him that ſpeaks, but in the Imagination
of his hearer, yet doubtleſs there is a true
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93658:13"/>
Standard-Wit, which muſt be allow'd for
ſuch by every one who underſtands the
Terms. I don't ſay that they ſhall all <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually</hi>
like it; and it is this ſtandard-Wit
that always pleaſes, the Spurious does ſo
only for a Seaſon.</p>
            <p>Now what is it that ſtrikes a judicious
Taſt? Not that to be ſure, which injures the
abſent, or provokes the Company, which
poiſons the Mind under pretence of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
it, proceeding from or giving Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
to falſe Ideas, to dangerous and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moral
Principles. Wit indeed is diſtinct
from Judgment, but it is not contrary to it;
'tis rather its Handmaid, ſerving to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and fix the Attention, that ſo we
may Judge rightly. Whatever Charms,
does ſo becauſe of its Regularity and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion;
otherwiſe, tho' it is extraordinary
and out of the way, it will only be ſtar'd
on like a Monſter, but can never be lik'd.
And tho' a thought is ever ſo fine and new,
ever ſo well expreſt, if it ſuits not with
decorum and good Manners, it is not juſt
and fit, and therefore offends our Reaſon,
and conſequently has no Charms, nor
ſhould afford us any entertainment.</p>
            <p>But it muſt not be ſuppos'd that Women's
Wit approaches thoſe heights which Men
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93658:13"/>
arrive at, or that they indulge thoſe Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
the other take. Decency lays
greater reſtraints on them, their timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſneſs
does them this one, and perhaps
this only piece of Service, it keeps them
from breaking thro' theſe reſtraints and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
their Maſters and Guides in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of their daring and maſculine Crimes.
As the World goes, your Witty Men are
uſually diſtinguiſh'd by the Liberty they
take with Religion, good Manners, or
their Neighbour's Reputation: But, GOD
be thank'd, it is not yet ſo bad, as that
Women ſhould form Cabals to propagate
Atheiſm and Irreligion. A Man then
cannot hope to find a Woman whoſe
Wit is of a ſize with his, but when he
doats on Wit it is to be imagin'd he
makes choice of that which comes the
neareſt to his own.</p>
            <p>Thus, whether it be Wit or Beauty that
a Man's in Love with, there's no great hopes
of a laſting Happineſs; Beauty with all
the helps of Art is of no very laſting date,
the more it is help'd the ſooner it decays,
and he who only or chiefly choſe for
Beauty, will in a little time find the ſame
reaſon for another choice. Nor is that
ſort of Wit which he prefers of a more
ſure tenure, or allowing it to laſt, it
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93658:14"/>
will not always pleaſe. For that which
has not a real excellency and value in it
ſelf, entertains no longer than that giddy
Humour which recommended it to us
holds; and when we can like on no juſt,
or on very little Ground, 'tis certain a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
will ariſe, as lightly and as unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countably.
And it is not improbable that
ſuch a Husband may in a little time by ill
uſage provoke ſuch a Wife to exerciſe
her Wit, that is, her Spleen on him, and
then it is not hard to gueſs how very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
it will be to him.</p>
            <p>In a Word, when we have reckon'd
up how many look no further than the
making of their Fortune, as they call it;
who don't ſo much as propoſe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
any ſatisfaction in the Woman to
whom they Plight their Faith, ſeeking on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be Maſters of her Fortune, that ſo
they may have Money enough to indulge
all their irregular Appetites; who think
they are as good as can be expected, if
they are but according to the faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Term, <hi>Civil Husbands:</hi> When we
have taken the number of your giddy Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
who are not more violent in their
Paſſion than they are certain to Repent
of it: When to theſe you have added ſuch
as Marry without any Thought at all,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93658:14"/>
further than that it is the Cuſtom of the
World; what others have done before
them; that the Family muſt be kept up,
the ancient Race preſerv'd, and therefore
their kind Parents and Guardians chuſe as
they think convenient, without ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting
the Young ones Inclinations, who
muſt be ſatisfied or pretend ſo at leaſt, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
pain of their diſpleaſure, and that heavy
conſequence of it, forfeiture of their Eſtate:
Theſe ſet aſide, I fear there will be but a
ſmall remainder to Marry out of better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations,
and even amongſt the few that
do, not one in a hundred takes care to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
his Choice.</p>
            <p>But do the Women never chooſe amiſs?
Are the Men only in fault? That is not
pretended; for he who will be juſt, muſt
be forc'd to acknowledge, that neither Sex
is always in the right. A Woman indeed
can't properly be ſaid to Chooſe, all that
is allow'd her, is to Refuſe or Accept what
is offer'd. And when we have made ſuch
reaſonable allowances as are due to the Sex,
perhaps they may not appear ſo much in
fault as one would at firſt imagine, and
a generous Spirit will find more occaſion
to pity, than to reprove. But ſure I tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs—it
muſt not be ſuppos'd that the
Ladies can do amiſs, he is but an ill-bred
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93658:15"/>
Fellow who pretends that they need a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment!
They are no doubt on't al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in the right, and moſt of all when
they take pity on diſtreſſed Lovers; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they <hi>ſay</hi> carries an Authority that no
Reaſon can reſiſt, and all that they <hi>do</hi> muſt
needs be Exemplary! This is the Modiſh
Language, nor is there a Man of Honour
amongſt the whole Tribe that would not
venture his Life, nay and his Salvation too
in their Defence, if any but himſelf at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
to injure them. But I muſt ask
pardon if I can't come up to theſe heights,
nor flatter them with the having no faults,
which is only a malicious way of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
and encreaſing their Miſtakes.</p>
            <p>Women, it's true, ought to be treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Civility; for ſince a little Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
and out-ſide Reſpect is all their
Guard, all the privilege that's allow'd
them, it were barbarous to deprive them
of it; and becauſe I would treat them
civilly, I would not expreſs my Civility
at the uſual Rate. I would not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pretence of honouring and paying a
mighty Deference to the Ladies, call
them fools to their faces; for what are
all the fine Speeches and Submiſſions
that are made, but an abuſing them in
a well-bred way? She muſt be a Fool
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93658:15"/>
with a witneſs, who can believe a Man,
Proud and Vain as he is, will lay his boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
Authority, the Dignity and Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of his Sex, one Moment at her Feet,
but in proſpect of taking it up again to
more advantage; he may call himſelf her
Slave a few days, but it is only in order to
make her his all the reſt of his Life.</p>
            <p>Indeed that miſtaken Self-Love that
reigns in the moſt of us, both Men and
Women, that over-good Opinion we have
of our ſelves, and deſire that others ſhould
have of us, makes us ſwallow every thing
that looks like Reſpect, without examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how wide it is from what it appears
to be. For nothing is in truth a greater
outrage than Flattery and feign'd Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
the plain Engliſh of which is this;
<q>I have a very mean Opinion both of your
Underſtanding and Vertue, you are
weak enough to be impos'd on, and vain
enough to ſnatch at the Bait I throw;
there's no danger of your finding out
my meaning, or diſappointing me of my
Ends. I offer you <hi>Incenſe</hi> 'tis true, but
you are like to pay for't, and to make
me a Recompence for your Folly in I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magining
I would give my ſelf this trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
did I not hope, nay were I not ſure,
to find my own account in it. If for
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93658:16"/>
nothing elſe, you'll ſerve at leaſt as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of my Wit, and how much ſoever
you ſwell with my breath, 'tis I deſerve
the Praiſe for talking ſo well on ſo poor a
Subject. We who make the Idols, are the
greater Deities; and as we ſet you up, ſo
it is in our power to reduce you to your
firſt obſcurity, or to ſomewhat worſe,
to Contempt; you are therefore only on
your good behaviour, and are like to be
no more than what we pleaſe to make you.</q>
This is the Flatterer's Language aſide, this
is the true ſenſe of his heart, whatever his
Grimace may be before the Company.</p>
            <p>Not but that 'tis poſſible, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
matter of Fact, to expreſs our ſelves
beyond the Truth in praiſe of a Perſon,
and yet not be guilty of Flattery; but
then we muſt Think what we ſay, and
Mean what we Profeſs. We may be ſo
blinded by ſome Paſſion or other, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
Love, which in Civil and Good-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd
Perſons is apt to exceed, as to believe
ſome Perſons more deſerving than really
they are, and to pay them greater Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
and Kindneſs than is in ſtrictneſs due
to them. But this is not the preſent Caſe;
for our fine Speech-makers doat too much
on themſelves to have any great paſſion
for another, their Eyes are too much fixt
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93658:16"/>
on their own Excellencies, to view an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other's
good Qualities through a Magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Glaſs,
at leaſt if ever they turn that
end of the Perſpective towards their
Neighbours, 'tis only in reſpect and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to themſelves. They are their
own Centres, they find a diſproportion in
every line that does not tend thither, and
in the next viſit they make you ſhall hear
all the fine things they ſaid repeated to the
new Object, and nothing remembred of
the former but her Vanity, or ſomething
elſe as Ridiculous, which ſerves for a foil,
or a whet to Diſcourſe. For let there be
ever ſo many Wits in the Company, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
would languiſh, and they would
be at a loſs, did not a little Cenſoriouſneſs
come in at a need to help them.</p>
            <p>Let us then treat the Ladies as Civilly
as may be, but let us not do it by Flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, but by endeavouring to make
them ſuch as may truly deſerve our hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Eſteem and Kindneſs. Men ought re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
for their own ſakes to do what in them
lies to make Women wiſe and Good, and
then it might be hoped they themſelves
would effectually Study and Practice that
Wiſdom and Vertue they recommend to
others. But ſo long as Men have baſe and
unworthy Ends to ſerve, it is not to be
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93658:17"/>
expected that they ſhould conſent to ſuch
Methods as would certainly diſappoint
them. They would have their own Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
do well, that's their Intereſt; but it
ſometimes happens to be for their turn that
another Man's ſhould not, and then their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity
fails them, and no Man is apter to
find fault with another's diſhonourable A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
than he who is ready to do, or
perhaps has done the ſame himſelf.</p>
            <p>And as Men have little reaſon to expect
Happineſs when they Marry only for the
Love of Money, Wit or Beauty, as has been
already ſhewn, ſo much leſs can a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
expect a tolerable life, when ſhe goes
upon theſe Conſiderations. Let the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
be carried as Prudently as it can be
on the Womans ſide, a reaſonable Man
can't deny that ſhe has by much the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
bargain. Becauſe ſhe puts her ſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
into her Husband's Power, and if
the Matrimonial Yoke be grievous, neither
Law nor Cuſtom affords her that redreſs
which a Man obtains. He who has Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Power does not value the Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of a Rebellious Subject, but knows
how to ſubdue him with eaſe, and will
make himſelf obey'd; but Patience and
Submiſſion are the only Comforts that are
left to a poor People, who groan under
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93658:17"/>
Tyranny, unleſs they are Strong enough
to break the Yoke, to Depoſe and Abdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
which I doubt wou'd not be allow'd
of here. For whatever may be ſaid againſt
Paſſive-Obedience in another caſe, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
there's no Man but likes it very well
in this; how much ſoever Arbitrary Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
may be diſlik'd on a Throne, Not <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
himſelf wou'd cry up Liberty to
poor <hi>Female Slaves,</hi> or plead for the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
of Reſiſting a Private Tyranny.</p>
            <p>If there be a diſagreableneſs of Humours,
which in my mind is harder to be born
than greater faults, as being a continual
Plague, and for the moſt part incurable;
other Vices a Man may grow weary of,
or may be convinced of the evil of them;
He may forſake them, or they him, but
his Humour and Temper are ſeldom, if
ever put off, Ill-nature ſticks to him from
his Youth to his grey Heirs, and a Boy

Perfection; for a Man can never be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete
Coxcomb, unleſs he has a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
ſhare of theſe to value himſelf upon;
what can the poor Woman do? the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
is too wiſe to be Advis'd, too good
to be Reform'd, ſhe muſt follow all his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and tread in all his unreaſonable ſteps,
or there is no Peace, no Quiet for her, ſhe
muſt obey with the greateſt exactneſs, 'tis
in vain to expect any manner of Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
on his ſide, and the more ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
the more ſhe may; his fantaſtical hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
grow with her deſire to gratifie
them, for Age encreaſes Opiniatry in ſome,
as well as it does Experience in others. Of
ſuch ſort of folks as theſe it was that <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
ſpake, when he ſaid, <hi>Seest thou a Man
wiſe in his own conceit, there is more hope of
a Fool than of him;</hi> That is, the profligate
Sinner, ſuch a one being always a Fool in
<hi>Solomon</hi>'s Language, is in a fairer way of
being convinc'd of his folly, and brought
to reaſon, than the Proud Conceited Man.
That Man indeed can never be good at
heart, who is full of himſelf and his own
Endowments. Not that it is neceſſary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is not poſſible for one to be totally
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93658:18"/>
ignorant of his own good Qualities, I had
almoſt ſaid he <hi>ought</hi> to have a Modeſt ſenſe
of 'em, otherwiſe he can't be duly thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
nor make the uſe of them that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
to the glory of God, and the good
of Mankind; but he views them in a wrong
light, if he diſcerns any thing that may
exalt him above his Neighbours, make
him over-look their Merit, or treat them
with Neglect or Contempt. He ought to
behold them with fear and trembling, as
Talents which he has freely receiv'd, and
for which he is highly Accountable, and
therefore they ſhou'd not excite his Pride,
but his Care and Induſtry.</p>
            <p>And if Pride and Self-conceit keep a
Man who has ſome good Qualities, and is
not ſo bad as the moſt of his Neighbours
from growing better, it for certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
and hardens the Wicked in his
Crimes, it ſets him up for a Wit, that is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Modern acceptation, one
who rallies at all that is ſerious, a contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the Prieſts firſt, and then of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity
himſelf. For Penitence and Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
are what his Haughtineſs can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bear, and ſince the Crimes he has been
guilty of have brought on him the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
of his own Mind, ſince he will
not take the regular way to be rid of them,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93658:19"/>
which is by Humbling himſelf and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
his Peace with Heaven, he bids de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance
to it, and wou'd if he could believe
there is no future State, no after Retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution,
becauſe he knows that a heavy
lot is in juſtice due to him.</p>
            <p>If therefore it be a Woman's hard Fate
to meet with a diſagreeable Temper, and
of all others the Haughty, Imperious and
Self-conceited are the moſt ſo, ſhe is as
unhappy as any thing in the World can
make her. When a Wife's Temper does
not pleaſe, if ſhe makes her Husband un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie,
he can find entertainments abroad,
he has a hundred ways of relieving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
but neither Prudence nor Duty will
allow a Woman to fly out, her Buſineſs
and Entertainment are at home, and tho'
he make it ever ſo uneaſie to her ſhe muſt
be content and make her beſt on't. She
who Elects a Monarch for Life, who
gives him an Authority ſhe cannot recall
however he miſapply it, who puts her
Fortune and Perſon entirely in his Power;
nay even the very deſires of her Heart accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to ſome learned Caſuiſts, ſo as that it is
not lawful to Will or Deſire any thing but
what he approves and allows, had need
be very ſure that ſhe does not make a
Fool her Head, nor a Vicious Man her
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93658:19"/>
Guide and Pattern, ſhe had beſt ſtay till
ſhe can meet with one who has the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of his own Paſſions and has
duly regulated his own Deſires, ſince he
is to have ſuch an abſolute Power over
hers. But he who doats on a Face, he
who makes Money his Idol, he who is
Charm'd with vain and empty Wit, gives
no ſuch Evidence, either of Wiſdom or
Goodneſs, that a Woman of any tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Senſe ſhou'd care to venture her ſelf
to his Conduct.</p>
            <p>Indeed, your fine Gentleman's Actions
are now a days ſuch, that did not Cuſtom
and the Dignity of his Sex give Weight
and Authority to them, a Woman that
thinks twice might bleſs her ſelf, and ſay,
is this the Lord and Maſter to whom I am
to promiſe Love, Honour and Obedience?
What can be the Object of Love but
amiable Qualities, the Image of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity
impreſs'd upon a generous and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Mind, a Mind that is above this
World, to be ſure above all the Vices, the
Tricks and Baſeneſs of it; a Mind that
is not full of it ſelf, not contracted to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
private Intereſts, but in imitation of
that glorious Pattern it endeavours to
Copy after, expands and diffuſes it ſelf to
its utmoſt capacity in doing Good. But
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93658:20"/>
this fine Gentleman is quite of another
Strain, he is the reverſe of this in every
Inſtance. He is I confeſs very fond of
his own Dear Perſon, he ſees very much
in it to admire; his Air and Mien, his
Words and Actions, every Motion he
makes declares it; but they muſt have a
Judgment of his ſize, every whit as Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and a Partiality as great as his own,
who can be of his Mind. How then can
I Love? And if not Love, much leſs Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
Love may ariſe from Pity or a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Deſire to make that Lovely which
as yet is not ſo, when we ſee any hopes
of Succeſs in our Endeavours of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
it; but Honour ſuppoſes ſome
excellent Qualities already, ſomething
worth our Eſteem, but alas there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more Contemptible then this trifle
of a Man, this meer Out-ſide, whoſe Mind
is as Baſe and Mean as his external Pomp
is Glittering. His Office or Title apart,
to which ſome Ceremonious Obſervance
muſt be paid for Order's ſake, there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in him that can command our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.
Strip him of Equipage and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
and ſuch things as only dazle our
Eyes and Imaginations, but don't in any
meaſure affect our Reaſon, or cauſe a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
in our Hearts, and the poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93658:20"/>
ſinks beneath our Notice, becauſe
not ſupported by real Worth. And if a
Woman can neither Love nor Honour,
ſhe does ill in promiſing to Obey, ſince ſhe
is like to have a crooked Rule to regulate
her Actions.</p>
            <p>A meer Obedience, ſuch as is paid only
to Authority, and not out of Love and a
ſenſe of the Juſtice and Reaſonableneſs of
the Command, will be of an uncertain
Tenure. As it can't but be uneaſie to the
Perſon who pays it, ſo he who receives it
will be ſometimes diſappointed when he
expects to find it, for that Woman muſt
be endow'd with a Wiſdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
much above what we ſuppoſe the
Sex capable of, I fear much greater than
e're a Man can pretend to, who can ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
conquer her Paſſions, and diveſt
her ſelf even of Innocent Self-love, as to
give up the Cauſe when ſhe is in the
right, and to ſubmit her enlightned Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
to the imperious Dictates of a blind
Will, and wild Imagination, even when
ſhe clearly perceives the ill Conſequences
of it, the Imprudence, nay Folly and
Madneſs of ſuch a Conduct.</p>
            <p>And if a Woman runs ſuch a Riſque
when ſhe Marrys Prudently, according
to the Opinion of the World, that is,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93658:21"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

               </gap>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:93658:22"/>
when ſhe permits her ſelf to be diſpos'd
of to a Man equal to her in Birth, Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and Fortune, and as good as the
moſt of his Neighbours, (for if none were
to Marry, but Men of ſtrict Vertue and
Honour, I doubt the World would be
but thinly Peopled) if at the very beſt
her Lot is hard, what can ſhe expect who
is Sold, or any otherwiſe betray'd into
mercenary Hands, to one who is in all,
or moſt reſpects unequal to her? A Lover
who comes upon what is call'd equal
Terms, makes no very advantageous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal
to the Lady he Courts, and to whom
he ſeems to be an humble Servant, for
under many ſounding Complements,
Words that have nothing in them, this is
his true meaning, He wants one to manage
his Family, an Houſe-keeper, an upper
Servant, one whoſe Intereſt it will be
not to wrong him, and in whom there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he can put greater confidence than in
any he can hire for Money. One who
may breed his Children, taking all the
care and trouble of their Education, to
preſerve his Name and Family. One
whoſe Beauty, Wit or good Humour and
agreeable Converſation will entertain
him at Home when he has been contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
and diſappointed abroad; who will
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93658:22"/>
do him that Juſtice the ill-natur'd World
denys him, that is, in any one's Language
but his own, ſooth his Pride and Flatter
his Vanity, by having always ſo much
good Senſe as to be on his ſide, to conclude
him in the right, when others are ſo Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
or ſo Rude as to deny it. Who
will not be Blind to his Merit nor contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
his Will and Pleaſure, but make it
her Buſineſs, her very Ambition to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
him: Whoſe ſoftneſs and gentle Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
will calm his Paſſions, to whom
he may ſafely diſcloſe his troubleſome
Thoughts, and in her Breaſt diſcharge
his Cares; whoſe Duty, Submiſſion and
Obſervance will heal thoſe Wounds other
Peoples oppoſition or neglect have given
him. In a Word, one whom he can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
Govern and conſequently may form
her to his will and liking, who muſt be
his for Life, and therefore cannot quit his
Service let him treat her how he will.</p>
            <p>And if this be what every Man expects,
the ſum of his violent Love and Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
when it is put into Senſe and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Intelligible, to what a fine paſs does
ſhe bring her ſelf who purchaſes a Lord
and Maſter, not only with her Money,
but with what is of greater Value, at the
price of her Diſcretion? Who has not ſo
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93658:23"/>
much as that poor Excuſe, Precedent and
Example; or if ſhe has, they are only
ſuch as all the World condemns? She will
not find him leſs a Governor becauſe ſhe
was once his Superior, on the contrary
the ſcum of the People are moſt Tyrani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
when they get the Power, and treat
their Betters with the greateſt Inſolence.
For as the wiſe Man long ſince obſerv'd,
a Servant when he Reigns is one of thoſe
things for which the Earth is diſquieted,
and which no Body is able to bear.</p>
            <p>It is the hardeſt thing in the World for
a Woman to know that a Man is not
Mercenary, that he does not Act on baſe
and ungenerous Principles, even when he
is her Equal, becauſe being abſolute Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
ſhe and all the Grants he makes her
are in his Power, and there have been
but too many inſtances of Husbands that
by wheedling or threatning their Wives,
by ſeeming Kindneſs or cruel Uſage,
have perſwaded or forc'd them out of
what has been ſettled on them. So that the
Woman has in truth no ſecurity but the
Man's Honour and Good-nature, a ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
that in this preſent Age no wiſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
would venture much upon. A Man
enters into Articles very readily before
Marriage, and ſo he may, for he performs
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:93658:23"/>
no more of them afterwards than he thinks
fit. A Wife muſt never diſpute with her
Husband, his Reaſons are now no doubt
on't better than hers, whatever they were
before; he is ſure to perſwade her out of
her Agreement, and bring her, it muſt
be ſuppos'd, <hi>Willingly,</hi> to give up what ſhe
did vainly hope to obtain, and what ſhe
thought had been made ſure to her. And
if ſhe ſhew any Refractorineſs, there are
ways enough to humble her; ſo that by
right or wrong the Husband gains his will.
For Covenants between Husband and
Wife, like Laws in an Arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
are of little Force, the Will of the
Sovereign is all in all. Thus it is in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Fact, I will not anſwer for the
Right of it; for if the Woman's Reaſons
upon which thoſe Agreements are groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
are not Juſt and Good, why did he
conſent to them? Was it becauſe there
was no other way to obtain his Suit, and
with an intention to Annul them when
it ſhall be in his Power? Where then is
his Sincerity? But if her Reaſons are
good, where is his Juſtice in obliging her
to quit them? He neither way acts like
an equitable or honeſt Man.</p>
            <p>But when a Woman Marrys unequally
and beneath her ſelf, there is almoſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93658:24"/>
that the Man is Sordid and
Unfair, that inſtead of Loving her he
only Loves himſelf, trapans and ruines her
to ſerve his own Ends. For if he had not
a mighty Opinion of himſelf, (which
temper is like to make an admirable Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,)
he cou'd never imagine that his
Perſon and good Qualities cou'd make
compenſation for all the advantages ſhe
quits on his account. If he had a real
Eſteem for her or valu'd her Reputation,
he wou'd not expoſe it, nor have her
Diſcretion call'd in Queſtion for his ſake;
and if he truly Lov'd her he wou'd not
reduce her to Straits and a narrow For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
nor ſo much as leſſen her way of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to better his own. For ſince GOD
has plac'd different Ranks in the World,
put ſome in a higher and ſome in a lower
Station, for Order and Beauty's ſake, and
for many good Reaſons; tho' it is both
our Wiſdom and Duty not only to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
with Patience, but to be Thankful
and well-ſatisfied when by his Providence
we are brought low, yet there is no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Reaſon for us to Degrade our ſelves;
on the contrary, much why we ought
not. The better our Lot is in this World
and the more we have of it, the greater is
our leiſure to prepare for the next; we
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93658:24"/>
have the more opportunity to exerciſe that
God-like Quality, to taſt that Divine
Pleaſure, Doing good to the Bodies and
Souls of thoſe beneath us. Is it not then
ill Manners to Heaven, and an irreligious
contempt of its Favours, for a Woman
to ſlight that nobler Employment, to
which it has aſſign'd her, and thruſt her
ſelf down to a meaner Drudgery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to
what is in a very literal Senſe a caring for
the things of the World, a caring not
only to Pleaſe, but to Maintain a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band?</p>
            <p>And a Husband ſo choſen will not at
all abate of his Authority and right to
Govern, whatever fair Promiſes he might
make before. She has made him her Head,
and he thinks himſelf as well qualify'd
as the beſt to Act accordingly, nor has
ſhe given him any ſuch Evidence of her
Prudence as may diſpoſe him to make an
Act of Grace in her Favour. Beſides,
great Obligations are what Superiors can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bear, they are more than can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd;
to acknowledge were only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
themſelves with ingratitude, and
therefore the readieſt way is not to own
but overlook them, or rather, as too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
do, to repay them with Affronts and
Injuries.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:93658:25"/>
What then is to be done? How muſt
a Man chuſe, and what Qualities muſt
encline a Woman to accept, that ſo our
Marry'd couple may be as happy as that
State can make them? This is no hard
Queſtion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let the Soul be principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd,
and regard had in the firſt Place
to a good Underſtanding, a Vertuous
Mind, and in all other reſpects let there
be as much equality as may be. If they
are good Chriſtians and of ſuitable Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
all will be well, but I ſhould be
ſhrewdly tempted to ſuſpect their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
who Marry after any of thoſe
ways we have been ſpeaking of. I dare
venture to ſay, that they don't Act accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Precepts of the Goſpel, they
neither ſhew the Wiſdom of the Serpent,
nor the Innocency of the Dove, they
have neither ſo much Government of
themſelves, nor ſo much Charity for their
Neighbours, they neither take ſuch care
not to Scandalize others, nor to avoid
Temptations themſelves, are neither ſo
much above this World, nor ſo affected
with the next, as they wou'd certainly be
did the Chriſtian Religion operate in
their Hearts, did they rightly underſtand
and ſincerely Practiſe it, or Acted indeed
according to the Spirit of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:93658:25"/>
But it is not enough to enter wiſely into
this State, care muſt be taken of our
Conduct afterwards. A Woman will not
want being admoniſh'd of her Duty, the
cuſtom of the World, Oeconomy, every
thing almoſt reminds her of it. Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
do not often ſuffer their Subjects to
forget Obedience through their want of
demanding it, perhaps Husbands are but
too forward on this occaſion, and claim
their Right oftner and more Imperiouſly
than either Diſcretion or good Manners
will juſtifie, and might have both a more
chearful and conſtant Obedience paid
them if they were not ſo rigorous in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting
it. For there is a mutual Stipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Love, Honour and Worſhip, by
which certainly Civility and Reſpect at
leaſt are meant, is as much the Woman's
due, as Love, Honour and Obedience is
the Man's, and being the Woman is ſaid
to be the weaker Veſſel the Man ſhou'd be
more careful not to grieve or offend her.
Since her Reaſon is ſuppos'd to be leſs, and
her Paſſions ſtronger than his, he ſhou'd
not give occaſion to call that ſuppoſition
in Queſtion by his pettiſh carriage and
needleſs Provocations. Since he is the
<hi>Man,</hi> by which very Word Cuſtom
wou'd have us underſtand not only greateſt
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93658:26"/>
ſtrength of Body, but even greateſt
firmneſs and force of Mind, he ſhou'd
not play the <hi>little Maſter</hi> ſo much as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to be cocker'd, nor run over to that
ſide which the Woman us'd to be rank'd
in; for according to the Wiſdom of the
<hi>Italians, Volete? ſi dice a gli ammalati:
Will you? Is ſpoken to ſick Folks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed Subjection, according to the
common Notion of it, is not over eaſie,
none of us whether Men or Women
but have ſo good an Opinion of our own
Conduct as to believe we are fit, if not to
direct others, at leaſt to govern our ſelves.
Nothing but a ſound Underſtanding, and
Grace the beſt improver of natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
can correct this Opinion, truly
humble us, and heartily reconcile us to
Obedience. This bitter Cup therefore
ought to be ſweetned as much as may be;
for Authority may be preſerv'd and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
kept inviolable, without that
nauſeous Oſtentation of Power which
ſerves to no end or purpoſe, but to blow
up the Pride and Vanity of thoſe who
have it, and to exaſperate the Spirits of
ſuch as muſt truckle under it.</p>
            <p>Inſolence 'tis true is never the effect of
Power but in weak and cowardly
Spirits, who wanting true <hi>Merit</hi> and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93658:26"/>
Judgment to ſupport themſelves in that
advantage ground on which they ſtand,
are ever appealing to their Authority, and
making a ſhew of it to maintain their
Vanity and Pride. A truly great Mind
and ſuch as is fit to Govern, tho' it may
ſtand on its Right with its Equals, and
modeſtly expect what is due to it even
from its Superiors, yet it never contends
with its Inferiors, nor makes uſe of its
Superiority but to do them Good. So that
conſidering the juſt Dignity of Man, his
great Wiſdom ſo conſpicuous on all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions,
the goodneſs of his Temper and
Reaſonableneſs of all his Commands,
which makes it a Woman's Intereſt as
well as Duty to be obſervant and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
in all things, that his Prerogative is
ſettled by an undoubled Right and the
Preſcription of many Ages, it cannot be
ſuppos'd that he ſhould make frequent and
inſolent Claims of an Authority ſo well
eſtabliſh'd and us'd with ſuch moderation,
nor give an impartial By-ſtander (cou'd
ſuch an one be found) any occaſion from
thence to ſuſpect that he is inwardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious
of the Badneſs of his Title;
Uſurpers being always moſt deſirous of
Recognitions and buſie in impoſing Oaths,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93658:27"/>
whereas a Lawful Prince contents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with the uſual Methods and Securities.</p>
            <p>And ſince Power does naturally puff
up, and he who finds himſelf exalted, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
fails to think he <hi>ought</hi> to be ſo, it is
more ſuitable to a Man's Wiſdom and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity
to be mindful of his great Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
than to inſiſt on his Rights and
Prerogatives. Sweetneſs of Temper and
an obliging Carriage are ſo juſtly due to
a Wife, that a Husband who muſt not
be thought to want either Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to know what is fit, nor Goodneſs
to perform it, can't be ſuppos'd not to
ſhew them. For ſetting aſide the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
of her Perſon to keep up his Name
and Family, with all the Pains and Trouble
that attend it, which may well be thought
great enough to deſerve all the reſpect and
kindneſs that may be, ſetting this aſide,
tho' 'tis very conſiderable, a Woman has
ſo much the diſadvantage in <hi>most,</hi> I was
about to ſay in <hi>all</hi> things, that ſhe makes
a Man the greateſt Complement in the
World when ſhe condeſcends to take him
<hi>for Better for Worſe.</hi> She puts her ſelf
intirely in his Power, leaves all that is
dear to her, her Friends and Family, to
eſpouſe his Intereſts and follow his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
and makes it her Buſineſs and Duty
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:93658:27"/>
to pleaſe him! What acknowledgments,
what returns can he make? What Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
can be ſufficient for ſuch Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
She ſhews her good Opinion of him
by the great Truſt ſhe repoſes in him,
and what a Brute muſt he be who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trays
that Truſt, or acts any way unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of it? Ingratitude is one of the baſeſt
Vices, and if a Man's Soul is ſunk ſo low
as to be guilty of it towards her who has
ſo generouſly oblig'd him, and who ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
depends on him, if he can treat her
Diſreſpectfully, who has ſo fully teſtify'd
her Eſteem of him, ſhe muſt have a ſtock
of Vertue which he ſhou'd bluſh to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
if ſhe can pay him that Obedience
of which he is ſo unworthy.</p>
            <p>Superiors indeed are too apt to forget
the common Priviledges of Mankind,
that their Inferiors ſhare with them the
greateſt Benefits, and are as capable as
themſelves of enjoying the ſupreme Good;
that tho' the Order of the World requires an
<hi>Outward</hi> Reſpect and Obedience from ſome
to others, yet the Mind is free, nothing but
Reaſon can oblige it, 'tis out of the reach of
the moſt abſolute Tyrant. Nor will it ever
be well either with thoſe who Rule or thoſe
in Subjection, even from the Throne to
every Private Family, till thoſe in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
look on themſelves as plac'd in that
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:93658:28"/>
Station for the good and improvement of
their Subjects, and not for their own
ſakes; not as the reward of their Merit
or that they may proſecute their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
and fulfil all their Pleaſure, but as
the Repreſentatives of GOD whom they
ought to imitate in the Juſtice and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of their Laws, in doing good and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
Bleſſings to all beneath them:
By which, and not by following the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Dictates of their own will, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
truly Great and Illuſtrious and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
fill their Place. And the Governed
for their Part ceaſing to envy the Pomp
and Name of Authority, ſhou'd reſpect
their Governours as plac'd in GOD's ſtead
and contribute what they can to eaſe them
of their real Cares, by a chearful and
ready compliance with thoſe their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
and by affording them the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of ſucceſs in ſuch noble and generous
Deſigns.</p>
            <p>For upon a due eſtimate things are
pretty equally divided; thoſe in Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as they have a leſs Glorious, ſo they
have an eaſier task and a leſs account to
give, whereas he who Commands has in
a great meaſure the Faults of others to
anſwer for as well as his own. Tis true
he has the Pleaſure of doing more good
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:93658:28"/>
than a Private Perſon can, and ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Reward of it when time ſhall
be no more, in compenſation for the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
he runs, the difficulties he at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
encounters, and the large Account
he is to make hereafter, which Pleaſure
and Reward are highly deſirable and moſt
worthy our purſuit; but they are Motives
which ſuch as uſurp on their Governors,
and make them uneaſie in the due diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of their Duty, never propoſe.
And for thoſe other little things that
move their Envy and Ambition, they
are of no Eſteem with a juſt Conſiderer,
nor will ſuch as violently purſue, find
their Account in them.</p>
            <p>But how can a Man reſpect his Wife
when he has a contemptible Opinion of
her and her Sex? When from his own
Elevation he looks down on them as
void of Underſtanding, and full of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
and Paſſion, ſo that Folly and a
Woman are equivalent Terms with
him? Can he think there is any Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
due to her whoſe utmoſt ſervices
he exacts as ſtrict Duty? Becauſe ſhe
was made to be a Slave to his Will,
and has no higher end than to Serve
and Obey him? Perhaps we arrogate
too much to our ſelves when we ſay this
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:93658:29"/>
Material World was made for our ſakes;
that its Glorious Maker has given us
the uſe of it is certain, but when we
ſuppoſe that over which we have Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
to be made purely for our ſakes, we
draw a falſe Concluſion, as he who
ſhou'd ſay the People were made for the
Prince who is ſet over them, wou'd be
thought to be out of his Senſes as well as
his Politicks. Yet even allowing that he
who made every thing in Number,
Weight and Meaſure, who never acts
but for ſome great and glorious End, an
End agreeable to his Majeſty, allowing
that he Created ſuch a Number of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Spirits merely to ſerve their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Creatures, yet how are theſe Lords
and Maſters helpt by the Contempt
they ſhew of their poor humble Vaſſals?
Is it not rather an hindrance to that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
they expect, as being an undeniable
and conſtant Proof how unworthy they
are to receive it?</p>
            <p>None of GOD's Creatures abſolutely
conſider'd are in their own Nature Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible;
the meaneſt Fly, the pooreſt
Inſect has its Uſe and Vertue. Contempt
is ſcarce a Human Paſſion, one may ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to ſay it was not in Innocent Man,
for till Sin came into the World, there
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:93658:29"/>
was nothing in it to be Contemn'd. But
Pride which makes every thing ſerve its
purpoſes, wreſted this Paſſion from its
only Uſe, ſo that inſtead of being an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote
againſt Sin, it is become a grand pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter
of it, nothing making us more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of that Contempt we ſhew, than
when poor, weak, dependent Creatures
as we are! we look down with Scorn
and Diſdain on others.</p>
            <p>There is not a ſurer Sign of a noble
Mind, a Mind very far advanc'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Perfection, than the being able to
bear Contempt and an unjuſt Treatment
from ones Superiors evenly and patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
For inward Worth and real Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
are the true Ground of Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority,
and one Perſon is not in reality
better than another, but as he is more
Wiſe and Good. But this World
being a place of Tryal and govern'd by
general Laws, juſt Retributions being
reſerv'd for hereafter, Reſpect and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
many times become due for Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's
ſake to thoſe who don't otherwiſe
deſerve them. Now tho' Humility keeps
us from over-valuing our ſelves or view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Merit thro' a falſe and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
<hi>Medium,</hi> yet it does not put out
our Eyes, it does not, it ought not to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:93658:30"/>
deprive us of that pleaſing ſentiment
which attends our Acting as we ought
to Act, which is as it were a foretaſt of
Heaven, our preſent Reward for doing
what is Juſt and Fit. And when a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
does a Mean and unjuſt Thing, as
all Contempt of one's Neighbour is, and
yet this does not provoke his Inferiors
to refuſe that Obſervance which their
Stations in the World require, they
cannot but have an inward Senſe of their
own real Superiority, the other having
no pretence to it, at the ſame time that
they pay him an outward Reſpect and
Deference, which is ſuch a flagrant Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the ſincereſt Love of Order as
proves their Souls to be of the higheſt
and nobleſt Rank.</p>
            <p>A Man therefore for his own ſake,
and to give evidence that he has a Right to
thoſe Prerogatives he aſſumes, ſhou'd treat
Women with a little more Humanity
and Regard than is uſually paid them.
Your whifling Wits may ſcoff at them,
and what then? It matters not, for they
Rally every thing tho' ever ſo Sacred,
and rail at the Women commonly in
very good Company. Religion, its
Prieſts, and theſe its moſt conſtant and
regular Profeſſors, are the uſual Subjects
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:93658:30"/>
of their manly, mannerly and ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
Jeſts. Surprizing indeed! not for the
newneſs of the Thought, the brightneſs
of the Fancy, or nobleneſs of Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but for the good Aſſurance with
which ſuch thread-bare Jeſts are again
and again repeated. But that your grave
Dons, your Learned Men, and which is
more your Men of Senſe as they wou'd be
thought, ſhould ſtoop ſo low as to make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives
againſt the Women, forget them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſo much as to Jeſt with their Slaves,
who have neither Liberty nor Ingenuity
to make Reprizals! that they ſhou'd
waſte their Time and debaſe their good
Senſe which fits them for the moſt weighty
Affairs, ſuch as are ſuitable to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
Wiſdoms and exalted Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings!
to render thoſe poor Wretches more
ridiculous and odious who are already
in their Opinion ſufficiently contemptible,
and find no better exerciſe of their Wit
and Satyr than ſuch as are not worth
their Pains, tho' it were poſſible to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
them, this, this indeed may juſtly
be wondred at!</p>
            <p>I know not whether or no Women are
allow'd to have Souls, if they have, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
it is not prudent to provoke them
too much, leaſt ſilly as they are, they at
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:93658:31"/>
laſt recriminate, and then what polite and
well-bred Gentleman, tho' himſelf is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd,
can forbear taking that law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Pleaſure which all who underſtand
Raillery muſt taſt, when they find his Jeſts
who inſolently began to peck at his
Neighbour, return'd with Intereſt upon
his own Head? And indeed Men are
too Humane, too Wiſe to venture at it
did they not hope for this effect, and
expect the Pleaſure of finding their
Wit turn to ſuch account; for if it be Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to reveal a Secret, this is without
doubt the whole deſign of thoſe fine Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
which have been made againſt the
Women from our great Fore-Fathers to
this preſent Time. Generous Man has
too much Bravery, he is too Juſt and
too Good to aſſault a defenceleſs Enemy,
and if he did inveigh againſt the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
it was only to do them Service.
For ſince neither his Care of their Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
his hearty endeavours to improve
their Minds, his wholeſome Precepts,
nor great Example cou'd do them good,
as his laſt and kindeſt Eſſay he reſolv'd
to try what Contempt wou'd do, and
choſe rather to expoſe himſelf by a ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
want of Juſtice, Equity, Ingenuity
and Good-nature, than ſuffer Women to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:93658:31"/>
remain ſuch vain and inſignificant Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
as they have hitherto been reckon'd.
And truly Women are ſome degrees
beneath what I have thus far thought
them, if they do not make the beſt uſe
of his kindneſs, improve themſelves,
and like Chriſtians return it.</p>
            <p>Let us ſee then what is their Part, what
muſt they do to make the Matrimonial
Yoke tolerable to themſelves as well as Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to their Lords and Maſters? That the
World is an empty and deceitful Thing,
that thoſe Enjoyments which appear ſo
deſirable at a diſtance, which rais'd our
Hopes and Expectations to ſuch a mighty
Pitch, which we ſo paſſionately coveted
and ſo eagerly purſued, vaniſh at our firſt
approach, leaving nothing behind them
but the Folly of Deluſion, and the pain
of diſappointed Hopes, is a common Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry;
and yet as common as it is, tho' we
complain of being deceiv'd this Inſtant,
we do not fail of contributing to the
Cheat the very next. Tho in reality it
is not the World that abuſes us, tis we
abuſe our ſelves, it is not the emptineſs of
that, but our own falſe Judgments, our
unreaſonable deſires and Expectations
that Torment us; for he who exerts his
whole ſtrength to lift a Straw, ought
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:93658:32"/>
not to complain of the Burden but of his
own diſproportionate endeavour which
gives him the pain he feels. The World
affords us all that Pleaſure a ſound Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
can expect from it, and anſwers all
thoſe Ends and Purpoſes for which it
was deſign'd, let us expect no more than
is reaſonable, and then we ſhall not fail
of our Expectations.</p>
            <p>It is even ſo in the Caſe before us;
a Woman who has been taught to think
Marriage her only Preferment, the ſum-total
of her Endeavours, the completion
of all her hopes, that which muſt ſettle
and make her Happy in this World, and
very few, in their Youth eſpecially, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
a Thought ſteddily to a greater diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
She who has ſeen a Lover dying
at her Feet, and can't therefore imagine
that he who profeſſes to receive all his
Happineſs from her can have any other
Deſign or Deſire than to pleaſe her;
whoſe Eyes have been dazled with all
the Glitter and Pomp of a Wedding,
and who hears of nothing but Joy and
Congratulation; who is tranſported with
the Pleaſure of being out of Pupillage,
and Miſtreſs not only of her ſelf but of
a Family too: She who is either ſo
ſimple or ſo vain, as to take her Lover
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:93658:32"/>
at his Word either as to the Praiſes he
gave her, or the Promiſes he made for
himſelf: In ſum, ſhe whoſe Expectation
has been rais'd by Court-ſhip, by all the
fine things that her Lover, her Governeſs
and Domeſtick Flatterers ſay, will find
a terrible diſappointment when the hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is over, and when ſhe comes calmly
to conſider her Condition, and views it
no more under a falſe Appearance, but
as it truly is.</p>
            <p>I doubt in ſuch a View it will not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
over-deſirable if ſhe regards only
the Preſent State of Things. Hereafter
may make amends for what ſhe muſt be
prepar'd to ſuffer here, then will be her
Reward, this is her time of Tryal, the
Seaſon of exerciſing and improving her
Vertues. A Woman that is not Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs
of her Paſſions, that cannot pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
ſubmit even when Reaſon ſuffers
with her, who does not practice Paſſive
Obedience to the utmoſt, will never be
acceptable to ſuch an abſolute Sovereign
as a Husband. Wiſdom ought to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
without Contradiction, but Strength
however will be obey'd. There are but
few of thoſe wiſe Perſons who can be
content to be made yet wiſer by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,
the moſt will have their <hi>Will,</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:93658:33"/>
and it is right becauſe it is their's. Such
is the vanity of Humane Nature that
nothing pleaſes like an intire Subjection;
what Imperfections won't a Man over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look
where this is not wanting! Tho'
we live like Brutes we wou'd have In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe
offer'd us, that is only due to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
it ſelf, wou'd have an abſolute and
blind Obedience paid us by all over whom
we pretend Authority. We were not
made to Idolize one another, yet the
whole ſtrain of Courtſhip is little leſs
than rank Idolatry: But does a Man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to give, and not receive his ſhare
in this Religious Worſhip? No ſuch
Matter; Pride and Vanity and Self-love
have their Deſigns, and if the Lover is
ſo condeſcending as to ſet a Pattern in
the time of his Addreſſes, he is ſo Juſt
as to expect his Wife ſhou'd ſtrictly Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
after it all the reſt of her Life.</p>
            <p>But how can a Woman ſcruple intire
Subjection, how can ſhe forbear to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
the worth and excellency of the
Superior Sex, if ſhe at all conſiders it?
Have not all the great Actions that have
been perform'd in the World been done
by them? Have not they founded Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires
and over-turn'd them? Do not
they make Laws and continually repeal
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:93658:33"/>
and amend them? Their vaſt Minds lay
Kingdoms waſt, no bounds or meaſures
can be preſcrib'd to their Deſires. War
and Peace depend on them, they form
Cabals and have the Wiſdom and Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
to get over all theſe Rubs which
may lie in the way of their deſired Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur.
What is it they cannot do? They
make Worlds and ruin them, form
Syſtems of univerſal Nature and diſpute
eternally about them, their Pen gives
worth to the moſt trifling Controverſie,
nor can a fray be inconſiderable if they
have drawn their Swords in't. All that
the wiſe Man pronounces is an Oracle,
and every Word the Witty ſpeaks a
Jeſt. It is a Woman's Happineſs to hear,
admire and praiſe them, eſpecially if a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Ill-nature keeps them at any time from
beſtowing due applauſes on each other.
And if ſhe aſpires no further ſhe is
thought to be in her proper Sphere of
Action, ſhe is as wiſe and as good as can
be expected from her.</p>
            <p>She then who Marrys ought to lay it
down for an indiſputable Maxim, that
her Husband muſt govern abſolutely and
intirely, and that ſhe has nothing elſe to
do but to Pleaſe and Obey. She muſt
not attempt to divide his Authority, or
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:93658:34"/>
ſo much as diſpute it, to ſtruggle with
her Yoke will only make it gall the
more, but muſt believe him Wiſe
and Good and in all reſpects the beſt, at
leaſt he muſt be ſo to her. She who can't
do this is no way fit to be a Wife, ſhe
may ſet up for that peculiar Coronet
the ancient Fathers talk'd of, but is not
qualify'd to receive that great reward,
which attends the eminent exerciſe of
Humility and Self-denial, Patience and
Reſignation the Duties that a Wife is
call'd to.</p>
            <p>But ſome refractory Woman perhaps
will ſay how can this be? Is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for her to believe him Wiſe and
Good who by a thouſand Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
convinces her and all the World of
the contrary? Did the bare Name of
Husband confer Senſe on a Man, and
the mere being in Authority infallibly
qualifie him for Government, much
might be done. But ſince a wiſe Man
and a Husband are not Terms con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible,
and how loath ſoever one is to
own it, Matter of Fact won't allow us
to deny that the Head many times ſtands
in need of the Inferior's Brains to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
it, ſhe muſt beg leave to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd
from ſuch high thoughts of her
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93658:34"/>
Sovereign, and if ſhe ſubmits to his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
it is not ſo much Reaſon as Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
that compells her.</p>
            <p>Now of how little force ſoever this
Objection may be in other reſpects, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
it is ſtrong enough to prove the
neceſſity of a good Education, and that
Men never miſtake their true Intereſt
more than when they endeavour to keep
Women in Ignorance. Cou'd they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
deprive them of their Natural
good Senſe at the ſame time they deny
them the due improvement of it, they
might compaſs their End; otherwiſe
Natural Senſe unaſſiſted may run into
a falſe Track, and ſerve only to puniſh
him juſtly, who wou'd not allow it to
be uſeful to himſelf or others. If Man's
Authority be juſtly eſtabliſh'd, the more
Senſe a Woman has the more reaſon
ſhe will find to ſubmit to it; if according
to the Tradition of our Fathers, (who
having had <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> of the Pen, thought
they had alſo the beſt <hi>Right</hi> to it,) Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's
Underſtanding is but ſmall, and
Men's Partiality adds no Weight to the
Obſervation, ought not the more care
to be taken to improve them? How it
agrees with the Juſtice of Men we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
not, but certainly Heaven is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93658:35"/>
more Equitable than to enjoyn
Women the hardeſt Task and give them
the leaſt Strength to perform it. And
if Men Learned, Wiſe and Diſcreet as
they are, who have as is ſaid all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
of Nature, and without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie
have, or may have all the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
of Art, are ſo far from acquitting
themſelves as they ought, from living
according to that reaſon and excellent
Underſtanding they ſo much boaſt of,
can it be expected that a Woman who
is reckon'd ſilly enough in her ſelf, at
leaſt comparatively, and whom Men
take care to make yet more ſo, can it be
expected that ſhe ſhou'd conſtantly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
ſo difficult a Duty as intire Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
to which corrupt Nature is ſo

            <p>If the Great and Wiſe <hi>Cato,</hi> a <hi>Man,</hi> a
Man of no ordinary firmneſs and ſtrength
of Mind, a Man who was eſteem'd as an
Oracle, and by the Philoſophers and
great Men of his Nation equal'd even to

Stoical Principles was not able to bear
the ſight of a triumphant Conqueror,
(who perhaps wou'd have Inſulted and

            <p>We never ſee or perhaps make ſport
with the ill Effects of a bad Education,
till it come to touch us home in the ill
conduct of a Siſter, a Daughter, or Wife.
Then the Women muſt be blam'd,
their Folly is exclaim'd againſt, when
all this while it was the wiſe Man's
Fault who did not ſet a better Guard
on thoſe who according to him ſtand in
ſo much need of one. A young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
as a celebrated Author tells us,
ought above all things to be acquainted
with the State of the World, the Ways
and Humours, the Follies, the Cheats,
the Faults of the Age he is fallen into,
he ſhould by degrees be inform'd of the
Vice in Faſhion, and warn'd of the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93658:36"/>
Application and Deſign of thoſe who
will make it their Buſineſs to corrupt
him, ſhou'd be told the Arts they uſe
and the Trains they lay, be prepar'd to
be Shock'd by ſome and careſs'd by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
warn'd who are like to oppoſe,
who to miſlead; who to undermine,
and who to ſerve him. He ſhou'd be
inſtructed how to know and diſtinguiſh
them, where he ſhou'd let them ſee,
and when diſſemble the Knowledge of
them and their Aims and Workings.
Our Author is much in the right, and
not to diſparage any other Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which are uſeful in their kind,
this will turn to more account than any
Language or Philoſophy, Art or Science,
or any other piece of Good-breeding and
fine Education that can be taught him,
which are no otherwiſe excellent than
as they contribute to this, as this does
above all things to the making him a
wiſe, a vertuous and uſeful Man.</p>
            <p>And it is not leſs neceſſary that a
young Lady ſhou'd receive the like In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions,
whether or no her Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
be fewer, her Reputation and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
however are to be more nicely
preſerv'd; they may be ruin'd by a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Ignorance or Indiſcretion, and then
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93658:36"/>
tho' ſhe has kept her Innocence, and ſo
is ſecur'd as to the next World, yet ſhe
is in a great meaſure loſt to this. A
Woman cannot be too watchful, too
apprehenſive of her danger, nor keep at
too great a diſtance from it, ſince Man
whoſe Wiſdom and Ingenuity is ſo much
Superior to hers, condeſcends for his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
ſometimes, and ſometimes by way
of Diverſion, to lay Snares for her. For
tho' all Men are <hi>Virtuoſi,</hi> Philoſophers
and Politicians in compariſon of the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
and Illiterare Women, yet they
don't all pretend to be Saints, and 'tis no
great Matter to them if Women who
were born to be their Slaves, be now and
then ruin'd for their Entertainment.</p>
            <p>But according to the rate that young
Women are Educated; according to the
way their Time is ſpent, they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin'd
to Folly and Impertinence, to ſay
no worſe, and which is yet more inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
they are blam'd for that ill Conduct
they are not ſuffer'd to avoid, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd
for thoſe Faults they are in a
manner forc'd into; ſo that if Heaven has
beſtowed any Senſe on them, no other
uſe is made of it, than to leave them
without Excuſe. So much and no more
of the World is ſhewn them, as ſerves to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:93658:37"/>
weaken and corrupt their Minds, to give
them wrong Notions, and buſie them in
mean Purſuits; to diſturb, not to regulate
their Paſſions, to make them timorous
and dependant, and in a word, fit for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe but to act a Farce for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
of their Governours.</p>
            <p>Even Men themſelves improve no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
than according to the Aim they
take, and the End they propoſe; and he
whoſe Deſigns are but little and mean,
will be the ſame himſelf. Tho' Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as 'tis uſually underſtood, is a Fooliſh,
not to ſay a Baſe and Pitiful Vice, yet the
Aſpirings of the Soul after true Glory are
ſo much its Nature, that it ſeems to have
forgot it ſelf and to degenerate, if it can
forbear; and perhaps the great Secret of
Education lies in affecting the Soul with
a lively Senſe of what is truly its Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and exciting the moſt ardent Deſires
after it.</p>
            <p>But, alas! what poor Woman is ever
taught that ſhe ſhould have a higher De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
than to get her a Husband? Heaven
will fall in of courſe; and if ſhe make
but an Obedient and Dutiful Wife, ſhe
cannot miſs of it. A Husband indeed is
thought by both Sexes ſo very valuable,
that ſcarce a Man who can keep himſelf
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93658:37"/>
clean and make a Bow, but thinks he is
good enough to pretend to any Woman,
no matter for the Difference of Birth or
Fortune, a Husband is ſuch a Wonder-working
Name as to make an Equality,
or ſomething more, whenever it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd.</p>
            <p>And indeed were there no other Proof
of Maſculine Wiſdom, and what a much
greater Portion of Ingenuity falls to the
Men than to the Women's Share, the
Addreſs, the Artifice, and Management
of an humble Servant were a ſufficient
Proof it. What good Conduct does he
ſhew! what Patience exerciſe! what Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty
leave untry'd! what Concealment
of his Faults! what Parade of his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues!
what Government of his Paſſions!
How deep is his Policy in laying his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
at ſo great a diſtance, and working
them up by ſuch little Accidents! How
indefatigable is his Induſtry, and how
conſtant his Watchfulneſs, not to ſlip any
Opportunity that may in the leaſt contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to his Deſign! What a handſome
Set of Diſguiſes and Pretences is he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
furniſh'd with! How conceal'd does
he lie! how little pretend, till he is ſure
that his Plot will take! And at the ſame
time that he nouriſhes the Hope of being
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93658:38"/>
Lord and Maſter, appears with all the
Modeſty and Submiſſion of an humble
and unpretending Admirer!</p>
            <p>Can a Woman then be too much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her Guard? Can her Prudence and
Foreſight, her early Caution be reckon'd
unneceſſary Suſpicion, or ill-bred Reſerve
by any but thoſe whoſe Deſigns they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
and whoſe Intereſt it is to declaim
againſt them? it being a certain Maxim
with the Men, tho' Policy or Good Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
allow them not to avow it always, that
the Women were made for their Sakes
and Service, and are in all reſpects their
Inferiors, eſpecially in Underſtanding; ſo
that all the Compliments they make, all
the Addreſs and Complaiſance they uſe,
all the Kindneſs they profeſs, all the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
they pretend to pay, has no other
Meaning, no other End, than to get the
poor Woman into their Power, to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
her according to their Diſcretion.
This is all pure Kindneſs indeed, and
therefore no Woman has Reaſon to be
offended with it; for conſidering how
much ſhe is expos'd in her own, and how
ſafe in their Keeping, 'tis the wiſeſt thing
ſhe can do to put her ſelf under Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And then if they have a tolerable
Opinion of her Senſe, and not their Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:93658:38"/>
but ſome better Principle diſpoſes
them to do ſomething out of the way,
and to appear more generous than the
reſt of their Sex, they'll condeſcend to
dictate to her, and impart ſome of their
Prerogative Books and Learning. 'Tis
fit indeed that ſhe ſhould entirely depend
on their Choice, and walk with the
Crutches they are pleas'd to lend her;
and if ſhe is furniſhed out with ſome
Notions to ſet her a prating, I ſhould
have ſaid to make her entertaining and
the Fiddle of the Company, her Tutor's
Time was not ill beſtowed: And it
were a diverting Scene to ſee her ſtript
like the <hi>Jay</hi> of her borrowed Feathers,
tho' he good Man has not ill Nature e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to take Pleaſure in it. You may
accuſe him perhaps for giving ſo much
Encouragement to a Woman's Vanity,
but your Accuſation is groundleſs, Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
being a Diſeaſe the Sex will always be
guilty of; nor is it a Reproach to them,
ſince Men of Learning and Senſe are
over-run with it.</p>
            <p>But there are few Women whoſe Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings
are worth the Management,
their Eſtates are much more capable of
Improvement, No Woman, much leſs
a Woman of Fortune, is ever fit to be
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:93658:39"/>
her own Miſtreſs, and he who has not
the Vanity to think what much finer
things he could perform had he the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of her Fortune; or ſo much
Partiality and Self-love, as to fanſie it
can't be better beſtow'd than in making
his; will yet be ſo honeſt and humble as
to think that 'tis fit ſhe ſhould take his Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
as Steward at leaſt. For the Good
Man aſpires no further, he would only
take the Trouble of her Affairs off her
hand; and the Senſe of her Condeſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and his great Obligations will for ever
ſecure him againſt acting like a Lord and
Maſter.</p>
            <p>The Steps to Folly as well as Sin are
gradual, and almoſt imperceptible, and
when we are once on the Decline, we
go down without taking notice on't;
were it not for this one cou'd not account
for thoſe Strange unequal Matches we
too often ſee. For there was a time no
doubt, when a Woman could not have
bore the very thought of what ſhe has been
afterwards betray'd into, it would have
appear'd as ſhocking to her as it always
does to other People; and had a Man
been ſo impolitic as to diſcover the leaſt
intimation of ſuch a Deſign, he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
her a ſufficient Antidote againſt it.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:93658:39"/>
This your Wiſe Men are well ſatisfy'd
of, and underſtand their own Intereſt too
well to let their Deſign go bare-fac'd, for
that would effectually put a barr to their
Succeſs. So innocent are they that they had
not the leaſt thought at firſt of what their
Good Fortune afterwards leads them to!
They would draw upon him, (if they
wear a Sword) or fly in her Face who
ſhould let fall the leaſt hint that they had
ſuch Intentions; and this very Eagerneſs
to avoid the Suſpicion, is a ſhrewd Sign
that there is occaſion for't.</p>
            <p>But who ſhall dare to ſhew the Lady
her Danger, when will it be ſeaſonable
to give her friendly Notice? If you do it
e're ſhe is reſolv'd, tho' with all the Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
and Tenderneſs imaginable, ſhe will
hardly forgive the Affront, or bear the
Provocation; you offer her an Outrage,
by entertaining ſuch a Thought, and 'tis
ten to one if you are not afterwards ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd
for putting in her Head what other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
ſhe could ne'er have dream'd of.
And when no direct Proof can be offer'd,
when matter of Prudence is the only
thing in queſtion, every Body has ſo good
an Opinion of their own Underſtanding
as to think their own way the beſt. And
when ſhe has her Innocence and fair In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93658:40"/>
to oppoſe to your Fears and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
and you cannot pretend to wiſh her
better than ſhe does her ſelf, to be more
diſintereſs'd and diligent in your Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,
or to ſee farther in what ſo nearly
concerns her, what can be done? Her
ruin is commonly too far advanc'd to be
prevented, e're you can in Good-breeding
reach out a hand to help her. For if the
Train has took, if ſhe is entangled in the
ſnare, if Love, or rather a Blind unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
Fondneſs, which uſurps the Name
of that noble Paſſion, has gain'd on her,
Reaſon and Perſwaſion may as properly
be urg'd to the Folks in <hi>Bethlem</hi> as to
her. Tell her of this World, ſhe is got
above it, and has no regard to its imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
Cenſures; tell her of the next ſhe
laughs at you, and will never be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
that Actions which are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
forbid can be Criminal, tho' they
proceed from, and muſt neceſſarily be
reduc'd to ill Principles, tho' they give
Offence, are of ill Example, injure our
Reputation, which next to our Innocence
we are obliged as Chriſtians to take the
greateſt care of, and in a word do more
miſchief than we readily imagine. Tell
her of her own Good, you appear yet
more ridiculous, for who can judge of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:93658:40"/>
her Happineſs but her ſelf? And whilſt
our Hearts are violently ſet upon any
thing, there is no convincing us that
we ſhall ever be of another Mind. Our
Paſſions want no Advocates, they are
always furniſh'd with plauſible Pretences,
and thoſe very Prejudices, which gave riſe
to this unreaſonable Paſſion, will for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
give her Obſtinacy enough to juſtifie
and continue in it. Beſides, ſome are
ſo ill advis'd as to think to ſupport one
Indiſcretion with another, they wou'd
not have it thought they have made a falſe
Step, in once giving countenance to
that which is not fit to be continued.
Or perhaps the Lady might be willing
enough to throw off the Intruder at
firſt, but wanted Courage to get above
the fear of his Calumnies, and the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
ſhe ſuffers him to buz about her,
ſhe will find it the harder to get rid of his
Importunities. By all which it appears
that ſhe who really intends to be ſecure,
muſt keep at the greateſt diſtance from
Danger, ſhe muſt not grant the <hi>least</hi>
indulgence, where ſuch ill uſes will be
made of it.</p>
            <p>And ſince the caſe is ſo, that Woman
can never be in ſafety who allows a Man
opportunity to betray her. Frequent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:93658:41"/>
does for certain produce either
Averſion or Liking, and when 'tis once
come to Liking, it depends on the Man's
Generoſity not to improve it farther, and
where can one find an Inſtance that this
is any ſecurity? There are very many
indeed which ſhew it is none. How ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
ſoever a Woman may appear of
anothers Indiſcretion, if ſhe will tread
in the ſame Steps, tho' but for a little
way, ſhe gives us no aſſurance that ſhe
will not fall into the ſame Folly, ſhe
may perhaps intend very well, but ſhe
puts it paſt her Power to fullfil her good
Intentions. Even thoſe who have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
their Diſcretion, the moſt valuable
thing next to their Vertue, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which Vertue it ſelf is but very
weak and faint, 'tis like were once as
well reſolv'd as ſhe, they had the very
ſame Thoughts, they made the ſame
Apologies, and their Reſentment wou'd
have been every whit as great againſt
thoſe who cou'd have imagin'd they
ſhou'd ſo far forget themſelves.</p>
            <p>It were endleſs to reckon up the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Stratagems Men uſe to catch their
Prey, their different ways of inſinuating
which vary with Circumſtances, and the
Ladies Temper, but how unfairly, how
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:93658:41"/>
baſely ſoever they proceed, when the
Prey is once caught it paſſes for Lawful
Prize, and other Men having the ſame
hopes and projects ſee nothing to find
fault with, but that it was not their own
Good Fortune. They may exclaim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it perhaps in a Ladie's hearing,
but it is only to keep themſelves from
being ſuſpected, and to give the better
Colour to their own Deſigns. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a Woman is cajol'd, and ſometimes
Hector'd, ſhe is ſeduc'd to Love a Man,
or aw'd into a Fear of him: He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends
her Honour againſt another, or
aſſumes the Power of blaſting it himſelf;
was willing to paſs for one of no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
till he cou'd make himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
at her coſt: He might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
at firſt to be <hi>her Jest,</hi> but he
carries on the humor ſo far till he makes
her <hi>his;</hi> he will either entertain or ſerve
her as occaſion offers, and ſome way or
other gets himſelf intruſted with her
Fortune, her Fame or her Soul. Allow
him but a frequent and free Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and there's no manner of Queſtion
but that his Ingenuity and Application
will at one time or other get the Aſcendant
over her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:93658:42"/>
And generally the more humble and
undeſigning a Man appears, the more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable
it looks that he ſhould dare to
pretend, the greater Caution ſhou'd be
us'd againſt him. A bold Addreſs and
good Aſſurance may ſometimes, but does
not always take. To a Woman of Senſe
an artificial Modeſty and Humility is
a thouſand times more dangerous, he
only draws back to receive the more
Encouragement, and ſhe regards not
what Advances ſhe makes towards him,
who ſeems to underſtand himſelf and the
World ſo well as to be incapable of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
an ill uſe of them. Wou'd it not be
unreaſonable and a piece of Ill-breeding
to be ſhy of him who has no pretenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or only ſuch as are Juſt and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt?
What hurt in a Viſit? Or what
if Viſits grow a little more frequent? The
Man has ſo much diſcernment, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
her Wit and Humour, and can ſhe
do leſs than be Partial to him who is
ſo Juſt to her? He ſtrives to pleaſe and
to render himſelf agreeable, or neceſſary
perhaps, and whoever will make it his
Buſineſs may find ways enough to do
it. For they know but little of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Nature, they never conſulted their
own Hearts, who are not ſenſible what
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:93658:42"/>
advances a well-manag'd Flattery makes,
eſpecially from a Perſon of whoſe Wit
and Senſe one has a good Opinion. His
Wit at firſt recommends his Flatteries,
and theſe in requital ſet off his Wit;
and ſhe who has been us'd to this high-ſeaſon'd
Diet, will ſcarce ever reliſh ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Converſation.</p>
            <p>Having got thus far to be ſure he is
not wanting to his good Fortune, but
drives on to an Intimacy, or what they
are pleas'd now a-days, tho' very unjuſtly,
to call a Friendſhip; all is ſafe under
this ſacred Character, which ſets them
above little Aims and mean Deſigns.
A Character that muſt be conducted
with the niceſt Honor, allows the
greateſt Truſts, leads to the higheſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements,
is attended with the pureſt
Pleaſures and moſt rational Satisfaction.
And what if the malicious World, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
of his Happineſs, ſhou'd take Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
at it, ſince he has taken all due Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions,
ſuch unjuſt and ill-natur'd
Cenſures are not to be regarded; for his
part the diſtance that is between them
checks all aſpiring deſires, but her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
is what he muſt not, cannot
want, Life is inſipid and not to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'd
without it; and he is too much
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:93658:43"/>
the Ladie's Friend, has too juſt a Value
for her to entertain a Thought to her
diſadvantage.</p>
            <p>Now if once it is come to this, GOD
help the poor Woman, for not much
Service can be done her by any of her
Friends on Earth. That Pretender to
be ſure will be the Darling, he will
worm out every other Perſon, tho' ever
ſo kind and diſintereſted. For tho' true
Friends will endeavour to pleaſe in order
to ſerve, their Complaiſance never goes
ſo far as to prove injurious; the beloved
Fault is what they chiefly ſtrike at, and
this the Flatterer always ſooths; ſo that
at laſt he becomes the moſt acceptable
Company, and they who are conſcious
of their own Integrity are not apt to bear
ſuch an unjuſt Diſtinction, nor is it by
this time to any purpoſe to remonſtrate
the Danger of ſuch an Intimacy. When
a Man, and for certain much more, when
a Woman is fallen into this Toyl, that
is, when either have been ſo unwary and
indiſcreet as to let another find out by
what Artifices he may manage their Self-love,
and draw it over to his Party, 'tis
too late for any one who is really their
Friend to break the Snare and diſabuſe
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:93658:43"/>
Neither Sex cares to deny themſelves
that which pleaſes, eſpecially when they
think they may innocently indulge it;
and nothing pleaſes more than the being
admir'd and humour'd. We may be told
of the Danger, and ſhown the Fall of
others, but tho' their Misfortunes are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo often or ſo lively repreſented to us,
we are all ſo well aſſur'd of our own
good Conduct, as to believe it will bring
us ſafe off thoſe Rocks on which others
have been Shipwrackt. We ſuppoſe it
in our Power to ſhorten the Line of our
Liberty when ever we think fit, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
that the farther we run, we
ſhall be the more unwilling to Retreat
and unable to judge when a Retreat is
neceſſary. A Woman does not know
that ſhe is more than half loſt when ſhe
admits of theſe Suggeſtions; that thoſe
Arguments ſhe brings for continuing a
Man's Converſation, prove only that ſhe
ought to have quitted it ſooner; that
Liking inſenſibly converts to Love, and
that when ſhe admits a Man to be her
Friend, 'tis his Fault if he does not make
himſelf her Husband.</p>
            <p>And if Men even the Modeſteſt and
the Beſt, are only in purſuit of their own
Deſigns, when they pretend to do the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:93658:44"/>
Lady Service; if the Honour they wou'd
ſeem to do her, tends only to lead her
into an Imprudent and therefore a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Action; and they have all that
good Opinion of themſelves as to take
every thing for Encouragment, ſo that
ſhe who goes beyond a bare Civility
tho' ſhe meant no more than Reſpect,
will find it Interpreted a Favour and
made ill Uſe of, (for Favours how Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
ſoever, never turn to a Ladies ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage;)
what ſhadow of a Pretence
can a Woman have for admitting an
intimacy with a Man whoſe Principles
are known to be Looſe and his Practices
Licentious? can ſhe expect to be ſafe
with him who has ruin'd others, and
by the very ſame Methods he takes with
her? If an Intimacy with a Man of a
fair Character gives Offence, with a
Man of an ill One, 'tis doubly and tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
Scandalous. And ſuppoſe neither
her Fortune nor Beauty can Tempt him,
he has his ill-natur'd Pleaſure in deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Vertue he will not Practiſe, or
if that can't be done, in blaſting the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of it at leaſt, and in making the
World believe he has made a Conqueſt
tho' he has found a Foil.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:93658:44"/>
If the Man be the Woman's Inferior,
beſides all the Dangers formerly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd,
and thoſe juſt now taken notice
of, ſhe gives ſuch a Countenance to his
Vices as renders her in great meaſure
partaker in them, and it can ſcarce be
thought in ſuch Circumſtances a Woman
cou'd Like the Man if ſhe were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd
to his Faults. Is he her Equal
and no unſuitable Match, if his Deſigns
are fair, why don't they Marry, ſince they
are ſo well pleas'd with each other's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
which only in this State can
be frequently and ſafely allow'd? Is he
her Better, and ſhe hopes by catching
him to make her Fortune, alas! The
poor Woman is neither acquainted with
the World nor her ſelf, ſhe neither
knows her own Weakneſs nor his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery,
and tho' he gives ever ſo much
Encouragement to this vain Hope 'tis on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in order to accompliſh her ruin. To
be ſure the more Freedom ſhe allows,
the more ſhe leſſens his Eſteem, and
that's not likely to encreaſe a real, tho' it
may a pretended kindneſs; ſhe ought
to fly, if ſhe wou'd have him purſue;
the ſtricteſt Vertue and Reſerve being
the only way to ſecure him.</p>

Religion and Reputation are ſo ſure
a Guard, ſuch a ſecurity to poor defence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Woman, that whenever a Man has
ill Deſigns on her, he is ſure to make a
Breach into one or both of theſe, by ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
endeavouring to corrupt her Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
to make her leſs ſtrict in Devotion,
or to leſſen her value of a fair Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and wou'd perſwade her that leſs
than ſhe imagines will ſecure her as to
the next World, and that not much
regard is to be given to the cenſures of
this: Or if this be too bold at firſt, and
will not paſs with her, he has another
way to make even her Love to Vertue
contribute to it's ruin, by perſwading
her it never Shines as it ought unleſs it
is expos'd, and that ſhe has no reaſon
to Boaſt of her Vertue unleſs ſhe has
try'd it. An Opinion of the worſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
that may be, and the moſt
miſchievous, which ſeems calculated to
feed her Vanity, but tends indeed to
her utter Ruin. For can it be fit to ruſh
into Temptations when we are taught
every day to pray againſt them? If the
Trials of our Vertue render it Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
'tis ſuch Trials as Heaven is pleas'd
to ſend us, not thoſe of our own ſeeking.
It holds true of both Sexes, that next
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:93658:45"/>
to the Divine Grace a Modeſt Diſtruſt
of themſelves is their beſt Security, none
being ſo often and ſo ſhamefully Foil'd,
as thoſe who depend moſt on their own
Strength and Reſolution.</p>
            <p>As to the Opinion of the World, tho'
one cannot ſay it is always juſt, yet ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
it has a Foundation, great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
is to be paid to it, and very good
uſe to be made of it. Others <hi>may</hi> be in
fault for paſſing their Cenſures, but we
certainly <hi>are</hi> ſo if we give them any the
leaſt juſt occaſion. And ſince Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is not only one of the Rewards of
Vertue, that which always ought, and
generally does attend it, but alſo a Guard
againſt Evil, an Inducement to Good,
and a great Inſtrument in the Hand of
the Wiſe to promote the common cauſe
of Vertue, the being Prodigal of the
one looks as if we ſet no great value on
the other, and ſhe who abandons her
good Name is not like to preſerve her
Innocence.</p>
            <p>A Woman therefore can never have
too nice a Senſe of Honor; provided ſhe
does not prefer it before her Duty; ſhe
can never be too careful to ſecure her
Character not only from the ſuſpicion of
a Crime, but even from the ſhadow of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:93658:46"/>
an Indiſcretion. 'Tis well worth her
while to renounce the moſt Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and what ſome perhaps will call the
moſt Improving Company, rather than
give the World a juſt occaſion of Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
or Cenſure. For beſides the injury
that is done Religion, which enjoyns
us to avoid the very Appearance of Evil,
and to do nothing but what is of good
Report, ſhe puts her ſelf too much in
a Man's Power who will run ſuch a
riſque for his Converſation, and expreſſes
ſuch a value for him, as cannot fail of
being made uſe of to do her a miſchief.</p>
            <p>Preſerve your diſtance then, keep out
of the reach of Danger, fly if you wou'd
be ſafe, be ſure to be always on the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
not ſuch as is Moroſe and Affected,
but Modeſt and Diſcreet, your Caution
cannot be too great, nor your Foreſight
reach too far; there's nothing, or what
is next to nothing, a little Amuſement
and entertaining Converſation loſt by
this, but all is hazarded by the other. A
Man underſtands his own Merit too well
to loſe his time in a Woman's Company
were it not to divert himſelf at her coſt,
to turn her into a Jeſt or ſomething
worſe. And wherever you ſee great
Aſſiduities, when a Man inſinuates into
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:93658:46"/>
the Diverſions and Humors of the Lady,
Liking and Admiring whatever ſhe does,
tho' at the ſame time he ſeems to keep
a due Diſtance, or rather exceeds in the
profoundeſt Reſpect, Reſpect being all
he dare at preſent pretend to, when a
more than ordinary deference is paid, when
ſomething particular appears in the look
and Addreſs, and ſuch an Obſequiouſneſs
in every Action, as nothing cou'd en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
a Man to, who never forgets the
Superiority of his Sex, but a hope to be
Obſerv'd in his turn: Then, whatever
the Inequality be, and how ſenſible ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he ſeems to be of it, the Man has
for certain his Engines a Work, the Mine
is ready to ſpring on the firſt opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and 'tis well if it be not too late to
prevent the poor Ladie's Ruin.</p>
            <p>To wind up this Matter, if a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
were duly Principled and taught
to know the World, eſpecially the true
Sentiments that Men have of her, and
the Traps they lay for her under ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
gilded Complements, and ſuch a
ſeemingly great Reſpect, that diſgrace
wou'd be prevented which is brought
upon too many Families, Women wou'd
Marry more diſcreetly, and demean
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:93658:47"/>
themſelves better in a Married State
than ſome People ſay they do. The
foundation indeed ought to be laid deep
and ſtrong, ſhe ſhou'd be made a good
Chriſtian, and underſtand why ſhe is ſo,
and then ſhe will be every thing elſe
that is Good. Men need keep no Spies
on a Woman's Conduct, need have no
fear of her Vertue, or ſo much as of
her Prudence and Caution, were but a
due ſenſe of true Honor and Vertue awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken'd
in her, were her Reaſon excited and
prepar'd to conſider the Sophiſtry of
thoſe Temptations which wou'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
her from her Duty, and were ſhe
put in a way to know that it is both
her Wiſdom and Intereſt to obſerve it.
She would then duly examine and weigh
all the Circumſtances, the Good and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
of a Married State, and not be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
with unforeſeen Inconveniencies,
and either never conſent to be a Wife,
or make a good one when ſhe does.
This would ſhew her what Human
Nature <hi>is,</hi> as well as what it <hi>ought</hi> to
be, and teach her not only what ſhe
may juſtly expect, but what ſhe muſt
be Content with; would enable her to
cure ſome Faults, and patiently to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
what ſhe cannot cure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:93658:47"/>
Indeed nothing can aſſure Obedience,
and render it what it ought to be, but
the Conſcience of Duty, the paying it
for GOD's ſake. Superiors don't right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
underſtand their own Intereſt when
they attempt to put out their Subjects
Eyes to keep them Obedient. A Blind
Obedience is what a Rational Creature
ſhou'd never Pay, nor wou'd ſuch an
one receive it did he rightly underſtand
it's Nature. For Human Actions are no
otherwiſe valuable than as they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to Reaſon, but a blind Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
is an Obeying <hi>without Reaſon,</hi>
for ought we know, <hi>against it.</hi> GOD
himſelf does not require our Obedience
at this rate, he lays before us the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and reaſonableneſs of his Laws, and
were there any thing in them whoſe
Equity we could not readily compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
yet we have this clear and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Reaſon on which to found our
Obedience, that nothing but what's Juſt
and Fit, can be enjoyn'd by a Juſt, a
Wiſe and Gracious GOD, but this is a
Reaſon will never hold in reſpect of
Men's Commands unleſs they can prove
themſelves Infallible, and conſequently
Impeccable too.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:93658:48"/>
It is therefore very much a Man's
Intereſt that Women ſhould be good
Chriſtians, in this as in every other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
he who does his Duty finds his
own account in it; Duty and true In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
are one and the ſame thing, and
he who thinks otherwiſe is to be pitied
for being ſo much in the Wrong; but
what can be more the Duty of the
Head, than to Inſtruct and Improve
thoſe who are under Government? She
will freely leave him the quiet Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of this World whoſe Thoughts
and Expectations are plac'd on the next.
A Proſpect of Heaven, and that only
will cure that Ambition which all Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Minds are fill'd with, not
by taking it away but by placing
it on a right Object. She will diſcern
a time when her Sex ſhall be no bar
to the beſt Employments, the higheſt
Honor; a time when that diſtinction,
now ſo much us'd to her Prejudice, ſhall
be no more, but provided ſhe is not
wanting to her ſelf, her Soul ſhall ſhine
as bright as the greateſt Heroe's. This
is a true, and indeed the only conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
this makes her a ſufficient compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
for all the neglect and contempt
the ill-grounded Cuſtoms of the World
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:93658:48"/>
throw on her, for all the Injuries brutal
Power may do her, and is a ſufficient
Cordial to ſupport her Spirits, be her
Lot in this World what it may.</p>
            <p>But ſome ſage Perſons may perhaps
object that were Women allow'd to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
themſelves, and not amongſt other
diſcouragments driven back by thoſe
wiſe Jeſts and Scoffs that are put upon
a Woman of Senſe or Learning, a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical
Lady as ſhe is call'd by way
of Ridicule, they would be too Wiſe
and too Good for the Men: I grant it,
for vicious and fooliſh Men. Nor is it to
be wonder'd that he is affraid he ſhou'd
not be able to Govern them were their
Underſtandings improv'd, who is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
not to take too much Pains with
his own. But theſe 'tis to be hop'd are
no very conſiderable Number, the fooliſh
at leaſt; and therefore this is ſo far from
being an Argument againſt their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement,
that it is a ſtrong one for
it, if we do but ſuppoſe the Men to be
as capable of Improvement as the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
but much more if according to
Tradition we believe they have greater
Capacities. This, if any thing, wou'd
ſtir them up to be what they ought,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:93658:49"/>
not permit them to waſt their Time and
abuſe their Faculties in the Service of
their irregular Appetites and unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Deſires, and ſo let poor contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Women who have been their Slaves,
excel them in all that is truly Excellent.
This wou'd make them Bluſh at
employing an immortal Mind no better
than in making Proviſion for the Fleſh
to fullfil the Luſts thereof, ſince Women
by a Wiſer Conduct have brought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to ſuch a reach of Thought, to
ſuch exactneſs of Judgment, ſuch clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and ſtrength of Reaſoning, ſuch
purity and elevation of Mind, ſuch
Command of their Paſſions, ſuch regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity
of Will and Affection, and in a
word to ſuch a pitch of Perfection as
the Human Soul is capable of attaining
even in this Life by the Grace of GOD,
ſuch true Wiſdom, ſuch real Greatneſs,
as tho' it does not qualifie them to make
a Noiſe in this World, to found or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
Empires, yet it qualifies them for
what is infinitely better, a Kingdom
that cannot be mov'd, an incorruptible
Crown of Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:93658:49"/>
Beſides, it were ridiculous to ſuppoſe
that a Woman, were ſhe ever ſo much
improv'd, cou'd come near the topping
Genius of the Men, and therefore why
ſhou'd they envy or diſcourage her?
Strength of Mind goes along with
Strength of Body, and 'tis only for ſome
odd accidents which Philoſophers have
not yet thought worth while to enquire
into, that the Sturdieſt Porter is not
the Wiſeſt Man. As therefore the Men
have the Power in their Hands, ſo there's
no diſpute of their having the Brains
to manage it. There is no ſuch thing
as good Judgment and Senſe upon Earth,
if it is not to be found among them:
Do not they generally ſpeaking do all
the great Actions and conſiderable Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
of this World, and leave that of
the next to the Women? Their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty
in forming Cabals and laying deep
Deſigns, their Courage and Conduct in
breaking through all Tyes Sacred and
Civil to effect them, not only advances
them to the Poſt of Honor and keeps
them ſecurely in it for twenty or thirty
Years, but gets them a Name, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys
it down to Poſterity for ſome
Hundreds, and who wou'd look any
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:93658:50"/>
further? Juſtice and Injuſtice are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred
by their Hands, Courts and
Schools are fill'd with theſe Sages; 'tis
Men who diſpute for Truth as well as
Men who argue againſt it; Hiſtories
are writ by them, they recount each
others great Exploits, and have always
done ſo. All famous Arts have their
Original from Men, even from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of Guns to the Myſtery of
good Eating. And to ſhew that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is beneath their Care, any more
than above their reach, they have
brought <hi>Gaming</hi> to an Art and Science,
and a more Profitable and Honourable
one too, than any of thoſe that us'd to be
call'd <hi>Liberal.</hi> Indeed what is it they
can't perform, when they attempt it?
The Strength of their Brains ſhall be
every whit as Conſpicuous at their Cups
as in a Senate-Houſe, and when they
pleaſe they can make it paſs for as ſure
a mark of Wiſdom, to drink deep as
to Reaſon profoundly; a greater proof
of Courage and conſequently of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
to dare the Vengeance of
Heaven it ſelf, than to ſtand the rallery
of ſome of the worſt of their fellow
Creatures!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:93658:50"/>
Again, it may be ſaid, if a Wife's
caſe be as it is here repreſented, it is
not good for a Woman to Marry, and
ſo there's an end of Human Race. But
this is no fair Conſequence, for all that
can juſtly be inferr'd from hence, is
that a Woman has no mighty Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to the Man who makes Love to
her, ſhe has no reaſon to be fond of
being a Wife, or to reckon it a peice of
Preferment when ſhe is taken to be a
Man's Upper-Servant; it is no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to her in this World, if rightly
manag'd it may prove one as to the
next. For ſhe who Marries purely to
do Good, to Educate Souls for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
who can be ſo truly mortify'd as
to lay aſide her own Will and Deſires,
to pay ſuch an intire Submiſſion for
Life, to one whom ſhe cannot be ſure
will always deſerve it, does certainly
perform a more Heroic Action than all
the famous Maſculine Heroes can boaſt
of, ſhe ſuffers a continual Martyrdom
to bring Glory to GOD and Benefit to
Mankind, which conſideration indeed
may carry her through all Difficulties,
I know not what elſe can, and engage
her to Love him who proves perhaps
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:93658:51"/>
ſo much more worſe than a Brute, as
to make this Condition yet more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
than it needed to be. She has
need of a ſtrong Reaſon, of a truly
Chriſtian and well-temper'd Spirit, of
all the Aſſiſtance the beſt Education
can give her, and ought to have ſome
good aſſurance of her own Firmneſs and
Vertue, who ventures on ſuch a Trial;
and for this Reaſon 'tis leſs to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
at that Women Marry off in haſt,
for perhaps. if they took time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
and reflect upon it, they ſeldom
wou'd.</p>
            <p>To conclude, perhaps I've ſaid more
than moſt Men will thank me for, I
cannot help it, for how much ſoever I
may be their Friend and humble Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
I am more a Friend to Truth.
Truth is ſtrong, and ſometime or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will prevail, nor is it for their
Honor, and therefore one wou'd think
not for their Intereſt, to be Partial to
themſelves and Unjuſt to others. They may
fancy I have made ſome diſcoveries
which like <hi>Arcana Imperii</hi> ought to be
kept ſecret, but in good earneſt, I do
them more Honor than to ſuppoſe their
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:93658:51"/>
lawful Prerogatives need any mean Arts
to ſupport them. If they have Uſurpt,
I love Juſtice too much to wiſh Succeſs
and continuance to Uſurpations, which
tho' ſubmitted to out of Prudence and
for Quietneſs ſake, yet leave every Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
free to regain their lawful Right
whenever they have Power and Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.
I don't ſay that Tyranny <hi>ought,</hi>
but we find in <hi>Fact,</hi> that it provokes
the Oppreſs'd to throw off even a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Yoke that ſits too heavy: And if
he who is freely Elected, after all his
fair Promiſes and the fine Hopes he rais'd,
proves a Tyrant, the conſideration that
he was one's own Choice, will not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
more Submiſſive and Patient, but
I fear more Refractory. For tho'it is
very unreaſonable, yet we ſee 'tis the
courſe of the World, not only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
Injury for Injury, but Crime for
Crime; both Parties indeed are Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but the Aggreſſors have a double
Guilt, they have not only their own,
but their Neighbour's ruin to anſwer
for.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:93658:52"/>
As to the Female-Reader, I hope ſhe
will allow I've endeavour'd to do her
Juſtice, nor betray'd her Cauſe as her
Advocates uſually do, under pretence
of defending it. A Practice too mean
for any to be Guilty of who have the
leaſt Senſe of Honor, and who do any
more than meerly pretend to it. I
think I have held the Ballance even,
and not being conſcious of Partiality I
ask no Pardon for it. To plead for
the Oppreſs'd and to defend the Weak
ſeem'd to me a generous undertaking;
for tho' it may be ſecure, 'tis not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
Honourable to run over to the
ſtrongeſt Party. And if ſhe infers from
what has been ſaid that Marriage is a
very Happy State for Men, if they
think fit to make it ſo; that they go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
the World, they have Preſcription
on their ſide, Women are too weak to
diſpute it with them, therefore they, as
all other Governors, are moſt, if not
only accountable, for what's amiſs.
For whether other Governments in
their Original, were or were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
according to the Merit of the
Perſon, yet certainly in this caſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:93658:52"/>
wou'd not have allotted the Man to
Govern, but becauſe he was beſt Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify'd
for it. So far I agree with him: But
if ſhe goes on to infer, that therefore he
has not theſe Qualifications, where is
his Right? If he miſemploys, does he
not abuſe it? And if he abuſes, according
to modern Deduction, he forfeits it,
I muſt leave her there. A peaceable
Woman indeed will not carry it ſo far,
ſhe will neither queſtion her Husband's
Right nor his Fitneſs to Govern, but
how? Not as an abſolute Lord and
Maſter, with an Arbitrary and Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
ſway, but as Reaſon Governs and
Conducts a Man, by propoſing what
is Juſt and Fit. And the Man who
acts according to that Wiſdom he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes,
who wou'd have that Superiority
he pretends to, acknowledg'd Juſt, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
no injury by any thing that has
been offer'd here. A Woman will va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
him the more who is ſo Wiſe and
Good, when ſhe diſcerns how much he
excells the reſt of his noble Sex; the
leſs he requires, the more will he Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
that Eſteem and Deference, which
thoſe who are ſo forward to exact, ſeem
conſcious they don't deſerve. So then
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:93658:53"/>
the Man's Prerogative is not at all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring'd,
whilſt the Woman's Privileges
are ſecur'd; and if any Woman think
her ſelf Injur'd, ſhe has a Remedy in
reſerve which few Men will envy or
endeavour to Rob her of, the Exerciſe
and Improvement of her Vertue here,
and the Reward of it hereafter.</p>
