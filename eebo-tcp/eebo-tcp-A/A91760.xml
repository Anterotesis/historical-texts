            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But if the Wall be <hi>Fire,</hi> what will become

to ſend a Spirit of Unity and Agreement

of the parts, as the common Intereſt of the

the Lord, to ſhew that he is an impregnable

for this is not a waſting, but a <hi>ſixed fire,</hi> like
that in the <hi>Buſh,</hi> which did not conſume it,
but <hi>dwelt in it, Deut. 33. 16.</hi> He is a <hi>Sun and

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115590:13"/>
as the fire of the Sun, <hi>Pſal. 84. 11. 89. 36.</hi>
the defence which is over his Glory, upon the
Aſſemblies of <hi>Sion,</hi> viz. The Pillar of the
Cloud, and of fire is <hi>never taken away. Iſai.
4. 5. Exod. 13. 22.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. It is an Active, an Offenſive, an <hi>Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious</hi>
defence. Other Walls are defenſive
only, to prohibit and hinder Aſſaults, but a
<hi>Wall of Fire</hi> doth <hi>fight</hi> for thoſe whom it doth
defend; it is not only a Wall, but a <hi>Magazine;</hi>
not only a fence, but a <hi>Weapon;</hi> not only a
muniment, but an <hi>Army.</hi> As <hi>Iſraels</hi> wall of
water did drown <hi>Pharoah,</hi> ſo the three Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens
Wall of Fire, did devour thoſe that
threw them into it. The protection of God
about his Church, is a moſt operative, and
a moſt efficacious protection.</p>
            <p>We have taken a view of the <hi>Wall,</hi> Let
us conſider the City thus walled, the <hi>Subject</hi>
of this Defence; I will be <hi>unto Her,</hi> unto
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the City of the great God, where
his <hi>dwelling</hi> is, there is his <hi>defence,</hi> as men uſe
to mound the places of their Habitation. The
more a people have of Gods <hi>preſence,</hi> the
more they have of his <hi>protection.</hi> His <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering</hi>
is <hi>upon his Glory. Iſai. 4. 5.</hi> His An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels

            <p>It is true, worldly Glory is in much more

            <p>And yet they are ſaid to be without God in

which ignorant men might be apt to caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

is conſpicuous his manifold <hi>Wiſdom,</hi>
in contriving a way to puniſh the ſin, and yet
to ſave the ſinner, to reconcile the ſeeming
Croſs demands both of Juſtice and Mercy,
that the one may be ſatisfied, and the other

<hi>Grace,</hi> ſo ſuperabounding above all the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance

of Excellencies, all the Divine Vertues

in the Goſpel of Grace, then in all other his

            <p>3. As by his gracious preſence, and his
Divine Ordinances, ſo by the moſt <hi>Happy
State</hi> whereinto we are tranſlated, is the Lord
the <hi>Glory</hi> in the midſt of his Church. That
State ſtandeth in glorious <hi>Relations,</hi> glorious
<hi>Habits,</hi> and glorious <hi>Priviledges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are two <hi>Glorious Relations</hi> belonging
to this Happy State. 1. A Relation of <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi>
the Guilt of ſin being removed, and
the ſinner by the Gift of the Righteouſneſs
of Chriſt reconciled unto God, and ſo ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled

whereby we are eſtated by gracious <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption,</hi>
in an heavenly Nobility, and have
right to a glorious Inheritance, <hi>1 John 3: 1.</hi>

faſhioning that Creature to the likeneſs of his

things.</p>
            <p>1. In <hi>Holineſs, Eph. 4: 24.</hi> Holineſs ſets

            </p>
            <p>2. In <hi>Peace</hi> and ſpiritual Joy, for faith in

Pre-exiſtence unto the Glory to come, and

nothing being able to ſeparate us from the
Love of God, the Spirit of Glory reſting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us even in our ſufferings, &amp; enabling us to
glory in them. <hi>Rom. 5: 3. Act. 5: 41.</hi> As the
Cloud in the Temple is called <hi>the Glory of the
Lord, 1 Reg. 8: 10, 11.</hi> So the Lord is the
Glory of his people, even when they are fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

Glory to ſuffer Honorably as well as to do ſo,
<hi>&amp; facere &amp; pati fortia Romanum eſt.</hi> The Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

            <p>We have ſeen how the Lord is a Defence

from the World, of conjunction

by his Promiſe, by his power, by his
Providence, by his Grace, a preſent Defence,
a proportionable Defence. A <hi>Wall of Fire,</hi> by
a Terrible and conſpicuous, an impregnable,
and invincible, a conſtant and perpetual, an
active and efficacious Defence. A Wall of
Fire to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> his moſt <hi>proper</hi> and moſt

            <p>The <hi>Glory in the midſt</hi> of it, by his gracious

<hi>State</hi> of the Church, in the glorious <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi>

In glorious <hi>Priviledges,</hi> of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an

add but a ſhort word of Application and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
have done.</p>
            <p>1. We Learn hence what a folly as well as
wickedneſs it is for <hi>Samaritans</hi> to oppoſe the
building of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> or the Temple, for
any Enemies to ſet themſelves againſt the
Church of God, as great a madneſs as for
<hi>Briars to contend with Flames,</hi> for ſtubble to

            </p>
            <p>2. We need not make uſe of carnal Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and ſinful means for protection againſt
Danger, for God can be alone a <hi>Wall of Fire</hi>
unto his people. Uſe not oppreſſion or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence

he truſted in God, and would not uſe
Carnal Wiſdom for his own ſafety, <hi>1 Sam.
24. 47. 26. 8. 11.</hi> This Wall of Fire can
better protect us, then all the broad or high
Walls of <hi>Jerico</hi> or <hi>Babylon</hi>: It is good keeping

long we are within a <hi>Wall of Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. This is great Comfort unto Holy men,
That the very <hi>Terrors</hi> of God are their <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</hi>
The Terrors of God at <hi>Sinai</hi> and in
the Wilderneſs, were for the <hi>Salvation</hi> of
Gods people. <hi>Habak. 3: 13.</hi> As the mercy of
God will not ſave thoſe that deſpiſe it, ſo the
fury of God will be a defence unto thoſe that
tremble at it. No attribute of God, but faith
can ſuck comfort from it.</p>
            <p>4. Envie not the Glory of the World, nor

ſhining in the face of Chriſt, and thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matchable
Riches wherewith he endoweth
the Church, in compariſon whereof, all the
glories of the World, are but droſs and dung.
If God would have the Honor of his Church
to ſtand in outward things, <hi>The Silver is his,
and the Gold is his, Hag. 2: 8. The Cattel on a
Thouſand Mountains his, Pſal. 50: 10.</hi> But as
Abraham gave <hi>portions</hi> to his other Children,
but the <hi>Inheritance</hi> to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> even all that he
had, <hi>Gen. 25: 5.</hi> As Princes at their Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
give Wine and Monie to the Multitude,
but Honors to their Favorites: So the Lord
giveth Earthly things many times more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally
to the men of the World, but beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<hi>himſelf</hi> for a <hi>Portion</hi> and <hi>exceeding great
reward</hi> unto his own people, and they eſteem
<hi>him precious, 1 Pet. 2: 7.</hi> And his <hi>Promiſes
precious, 2 Pet. 1: 4.</hi> and his <hi>Redemption pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
Pſal. 49: 8.</hi> And the very <hi>Afflictions</hi>

            <p>5. Above all things, hold faſt God and
his preſence. A City is never without Walls
or Gates, without glory and ſplendor, till
they are without God. Your glory departs
when his <hi>Ordinauces</hi> are removed: You may
confidently promife your ſelf his <hi>protection,</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:115590:19"/>
while you make his <hi>Habitation</hi> in the midſt of
you your greateſt <hi>Glory.</hi> And therefore, as he
hath a long time been <hi>a Wall of Fire</hi> about
you; in all the confuſions of a bloody War,
no alarm hath ſtartled or ſtormed you, though
there were angry men, who <hi>ſhooke their Arm</hi>
againſt <hi>London,</hi> as the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> againſt <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,
Iſai. 10: 32.</hi> That ſaid it would never
be well with <hi>England</hi> till <hi>London</hi> were in a
flame, yet you have had no flame about you
but <hi>a Wall of Fire,</hi> and Chariots of Fire, as
the Prophet had, <hi>2 Reg. 6: 17.</hi> As therefore
the Lord hath protected you, and been the
<hi>Glory in the midſt of London,</hi> (for I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
it is a ſober Truth, that no City in
the Chriſtian World hath had a more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
preſence of God by the Light of his
Word, and the purity of his Worſhip and
Ordinances then <hi>London</hi> hath had:) So make
it your buſineſs in an anſwerable proportion
to bring <hi>Glory to God,</hi> by zeal for the Truth,
by Love to the Ordinances, by comforting
the Miniſters, and encourageing them in the
work of the Lord, by executeing Juſtice and
Judgment, reforming all abuſes, ſetting up
the Name of God in your Families, preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
thoſe that belong unto you from the
Contagion of dangerous and dividing
Doctrines <hi>God will be with you while you are
with him,</hi> he never breaks with a people firſt,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:115590:19"/>
do you <hi>give Glory</hi> to him, and he will <hi>be Glory</hi>
to you.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, If God be thus your <hi>Glory,</hi> let
your <hi>glorying</hi> be in him alone, Glory not in
your Strength or Wiſdom or Wealth, or
Splendor in your Ships or Trade, or in the
<hi>Harveſt of the River,</hi> glory only in your <hi>Wall
of Fire,</hi> and in this that the Lord hath been
hitherto ſo nigh unto you. And truly you
have great Reaſon to bleſs the Lord, and to
make your boaſt of him all the day long, as
for Remoter mercies which you muſt not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get,
though I cannot now recount them, ſo
for thoſe ſignal Mercies for the celebration
whereof you are met together at this time.</p>
            <p>What a deluge of <hi>Confuſion</hi> theſe poor
Nations were running into, how deep the
<hi>diſcontents</hi> of the people, how ready the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of unſatisfied Spirits in all parts of the
Nation to take Fire and break out into a
<hi>Flame,</hi> in what danger the Function of a
Learned and Orthodox <hi>Miniſtry</hi> and the
maintenance thereof was to be devoured,
How deſperately the <hi>Ordiances</hi> were deſpiſed,
the <hi>Truths</hi> of Religion rejected; what dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<hi>divulſions</hi> daily more and more made
from the Unity of the Church of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us, How near we were brought
unto the brow of the precipice, it is now
our Comfort that we can with thankfulneſs,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:115590:20"/>
recount, as ſurviving ſo great dangers, as well
as with ſorrow bewaile our expoſedneſs unto
them.</p>
            <p>How ſhould our Hearts be enlarged, and
our Mouths filled, and our Lives acted with
the Praiſes of the Lord, what Memorials, and
Monuments, and <hi>Eben-Ezers,</hi> ſhould we
every where erect of thoſe wonders, and
<hi>terrible things which we looked not for,</hi> which
the Lord hath wrought for us in a kind of
Pararel and proportion to thoſe which he
wrought for <hi>Iſrael</hi> at the Red Sea?</p>
            <p>That then when force after force, and
breach after breach, had been made upon the
ſolemn Conventions of the Nations, and
the Ancient Honor of the Engliſh <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
had been raviſhed and proſtitated to
the Will and Paſſions of their own Servants;
when the Licentiouſneſs of the times, made
way for men of corrupt Principles and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Confidence <hi>tantùm non,</hi> to ſpit in the
Face of <hi>Magiſtracy</hi> and <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> and all <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety</hi>
of Judgment amongſt us; then for the
Lord to ſtir up the Spirits of all the people of
the Land as one man, ſolemnly to own their
Native Liberties, and with united Affections
to implore the Vindication of them; then for
the Lord to awaken an Honorable Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to aſſert the Priviledges and Dignities
of conculcated Parliaments, and to reſtore
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115590:20"/>
the many grave and Eminent Members there

the adminiſtration of their Truſt again; To
ſtand by this <hi>Famous City</hi> who had chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
with their Treaſures, their Swords, their
Lives, their Counſels aided and aſſerted the
publick Engagements; That then when your
Hearts were ready to ſink at the demoliſhing
of your <hi>City Gates,</hi> immediately they ſhould
be revived with the opening of your <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
gates,</hi> that thoſe worthy Patriots, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of Truth and Righteouſneſs, might enter
in; as we ought with great Love and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
to reſpect the <hi>Inſtruments,</hi> ſo ought we to
aſcribe the whole <hi>glory</hi> unto <hi>God alone, who
only doth wondrous things,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 72: 18.</note> at whoſe preſence
