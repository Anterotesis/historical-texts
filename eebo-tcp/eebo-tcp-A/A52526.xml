         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                           <p>YOu are the <hi>Grand Inqueſt</hi> for the Body of this County of
<hi>Middleſex:</hi> You may perceive by this <hi>Commiſſion</hi> that hath
been read, that we are authorized by the King's Majeſty to hear,
and determine, all Treaſons, Felonies, and other Offences, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
this County: But becauſe this <hi>Commiſſion</hi> is upon a ſpecial
occaſion, the Execrable Murther of the bleſſed King, that is
now a Saint in Heaven, King <hi>Charls the firſt;</hi> we ſhall not
trouble you with the Heads of a long <hi>Charge.</hi> The ground of
this <hi>Commiſſion</hi> was, and is, from the <hi>Act of Oblivion, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempnity.</hi>
You ſhall find in that <hi>Act</hi> there is an Exception of
ſeveral perſons, who (for their Execrable Treaſons, in ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencing
to Death, and ſigning the <hi>Warrant</hi> for the taking
away the Life of our ſaid Sovereign) are left to be proceeded
againſt as Traytors, according to the Laws of <hi>England;</hi> and
are out of that <hi>Act</hi> wholly excepted, and fore-prized.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> You ſee theſe Perſons are to be proceeded with,
according to the Laws of the Land; and I ſhall ſpeak nothing
to you, but what are the words of the Laws. By the <hi>Statute</hi>
of the twenty fifth of <hi>Edward the third</hi> (a <hi>Statute,</hi> or <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
of Treaſon) it is made High-Treaſon to compaſs, and
imagine, the Death of the King. It was the ancient Laws of
the Nation. In no Caſe elſe Imagination, or Compaſſing,
without an Actual Effect of it, was puniſhable by our Law.
<hi>Nihil officit Conatus, niſi ſequatur Effectus;</hi> that was the old
<hi>Rule</hi> of Law: But in the caſe of the King; His Life was ſo
pretious, that the Intent was Treaſon by the <hi>Common Law;</hi>
and Declared Treaſon by this <hi>Statute.</hi> The reaſon of it is
this, In the caſe of the Death of the King, the Head of the
Commonwealth that's cut off: and what a Trunk, an <hi>inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi>
Lump, the Body is, when the Head is gone, you all know.
For the Life of a ſingle man, there's the Life of the Offendor;
there's ſome Recompence, Life for Life: But for the Death of
the King what Recompence can be made? This Compaſſing,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56280:7"/>
and Imagining the cutting off the Head of the King is known
by ſome <hi>Overt-Act.</hi> Treaſon it is in the wicked Imagination;
though not Treaſon Apparent; but when this Poiſon ſwells
out of the Heart, and breaks forth into Action: in that caſe,
it's High-Treaſon.</p>
                           <p>Then what is an Imagination, or Compaſſing of the King's
Death? Truly, it is any thing which ſhews what the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
is. Words in many caſes, are Evidences of this
Imagination: they are Evidences of the Heart. Secondly, As
Words: ſo if a man, if two men do conſpire to Levy War
againſt the King (and (by the way) what I ſay of the King,
is, as well of the King dead, as living; for, if a Treaſon be
committed in the Life of one King, it is a Treaſon, and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in the Time of the Succeſſor) Then, I ſay, in caſe, not
only of Words; but if they conſpire to Levy War againſt the
King, there's another Branch of this <hi>Statute,</hi> the <hi>Levying of
War</hi> is Treaſon. But, if men ſhall go, and conſult together,
and this is to kill the King, to put Him to Death: this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation
is clearly an <hi>Overt-Act</hi> to prove this Imagination, or
Compaſſing of the King's Death.</p>
                           <p>But what will you ſay then, if men do not only go about to
conſpire, and conſult; but take upon them to Judge Condemn,
nay, put to Death the King? Certainly, this is ſo much beyond
the Imagination and Compaſſing: as 'tis not only laying the
Cockatrice's Egg; but brooding upon it, till it hath brought
forth a Serpent. I muſt deliver to you for plain, and true,
Law; That <hi>no Authority, no ſingle perſon, no community of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
not the people Collectively, or Repreſentatively, have any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercive
power over the King of</hi> England. And I do not ſpeak mine
own Sence; but the words of the Laws unto you. It was the
Treaſon of the <hi>Spencers,</hi> in King <hi>Edward the Second's</hi> Time, in
<hi>Calvin's</hi> caſe, ſecond <hi>Report.</hi> The <hi>Spencers</hi> had an opinion,
that all Homage and Allegiance was due to the King, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the Crown, as they called it. And thereupon (ſay the
<hi>Books,</hi> and <hi>Records)</hi> they drew out this execrable Inference
(among others) That if the King did not demean himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Right; becauſe he could not be reformed by Law,
he might <hi>per aſpertee,</hi> that is, <hi>by ſharp Impriſonment:</hi> but this
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56280:8"/>
was adjudged horrid Treaſon by two <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> Let me tell you what our <hi>Law-books</hi> ſay: for
there's the Ground, out of which (and the <hi>Statutes</hi> together)
we muſt draw all our Concluſions for matter of Government.</p>
                           <p>How do they Stile the <hi>King?</hi> They call Him, <hi>The Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of God,</hi> and many other expreſſions, in the Book of <hi>Primo
Henrici Septimi.</hi> Says that Book there; <hi>The King is immediate
from God, and hath no Superior.</hi> The <hi>Statutes ſay;</hi> That
<hi>the Crown of</hi> England <hi>is immediately ſubject to God, and to no other
Power. The King</hi> (ſays our Books) <hi>He is not only</hi> Caput Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puli,
<hi>the Head of the People; but</hi> Caput Reipublicae, <hi>the Head
of the Commonwealth, The three Eſtates.</hi> And, truly, thus our
<hi>Statutes</hi> ſpeak very fully. Common Experience tells you,
when we ſpeak of the King, and ſo the <hi>Statutes</hi> of <hi>Edward
the Third,</hi> we call the King, <hi>Our Sovereign Lord the King: So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign,</hi>
that is, <hi>Supreme.</hi> And when the Lords, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
in <hi>Parliament,</hi> apply themſelves to the King, they uſe
this Expreſſion, <hi>Your Lords, and Commons, your faithful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
humbly beſeech.</hi> I do not ſpeak any Words of my own;
but the Words of the Laws. Look upon the <hi>Statute, primo Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobi,</hi>
there's a Recognition, that the Crown of <hi>England</hi> was
lawfully deſcended on the King, and His Progeny.</p>
                           <p>(The <hi>Statute</hi> it ſelf was read, to which it is deſired, the <hi>Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
will be referred.)</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Theſe are the Words of the</hi> Act. <hi>And this is not the firſt
precedent: for you ſhall find it</hi> primo <hi>Eli.</hi> cap. 3. <hi>They do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the Imperial Crown lawfully deſcended on the</hi>
Queen, <hi>the ſame</hi> Recognition <hi>with this. Before that (becauſe
we ſhall ſhew you we go upon Grounds of Law in what we
ſay)</hi> Stat. 24. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. cap. 12. Whereas by ſundry old authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Hiſtories, and Chronicles, it is manifeſtly declared, and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
that this Realm of <hi>England</hi> is an Empire, and ſo hath been
accepted in the world, governed by one Supreme Head and King,
having the Dignity, and Royal Eſtate of the Imperial Crown, of
the ſame, &amp;c.</p>
                           <p>25 Hen. 8. <hi>c.</hi> 21. there it is, the people, ſpeaking of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
That they <hi>do recognize no Superiour under God, but only
the King's Grace.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="13" facs="tcp:56280:8"/>
                              <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> You ſee, if the King be immediate under God, he
derives his Authority from no body elſe: if the King have an
Imperial Power; if the King be Head of the Commonwealth,
Head of the body Politick; if the body Politick own him obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:
truly, I think it is an undenied conſequence, He muſt
needs be Superiour over them.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> This is no new thing, to talk of an <hi>Emperour,</hi> or
an <hi>Imperial Crown.</hi> Do not miſtake me all this while: It is
one thing to have an <hi>Imperial Crown,</hi> and another thing to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
<hi>abſolutely.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> The <hi>Imperial Crown</hi> is a Word, that is ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive:
you ſhall find in all <hi>Statutes, primo Eliz.</hi> and the firſt of
King <hi>James,</hi> nay, even in the <hi>Act</hi> of Judicial proceedings of
this <hi>Parliament,</hi> it is called an Imperial Crown. They that
take the Oaths of Allegiance, and Supremacy, they ſwear that
they will, to their power, aſſiſt, and defend all Juriſdictions,
Priviledges, Preheminences, and Authorities, granted or belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the King, His Heirs, and Succeſſors, or annexed to the
<hi>Imperial Crown</hi> of this Realm. What is an <hi>Imperial Crown?</hi> It
is that, which, as to the Coercive part, is ſubject to no man
under God. The King of <hi>Poland</hi> has a Crown: But what is
it? At his <hi>Coronation</hi> it is conditioned with the people; That,
if he ſhall not Govern them according to ſuch <hi>Rules,</hi> they
ſhall be freed from their Homage, and Allegiance. But the
Crown of <hi>England</hi> is, and always was, an <hi>Imperial</hi> Crown, and
ſo ſworn.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> As I told you, even now, the <hi>Imperial</hi> Crown is
a Word ſignificative; that Crown, which as to the Coercive
part, is not ſubject-to any Humane Tribunal, or Judicature,
whatſoever. And, truly, that this is ſuch an <hi>Imperial</hi> Crown,
though I have cited Authorities ancient enough, you may find
them much more ancient. I remember, in the Story of <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
Rufus</hi> (you ſhall find it in <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi> and <hi>Eadmerus)</hi>
ſome <hi>Queſtion</hi> was about <hi>Inveſtiture</hi> of Biſhops, and the like, the
King writes His Letter, <hi>That, &amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>God forbid, I ſhould intend any abſolute Government by
this. It is one thing to have an <hi>Abſolute</hi> Monarchy, another
thing to have that Government <hi>Abſolutely</hi> without Laws, as to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56280:9"/>
any coercive power over the Perſon of the King: for as to
<hi>Things,</hi> and <hi>Actions,</hi> they will fall under another conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as I will tell you by and by.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> Since this is ſo, conſider the Oath of Supremacy,
which moſt men have taken, or ſhould take. All men, that
enter into the <hi>Parliament</hi>-Houſe, they are expreſly enjoyned
by <hi>Statute</hi> to take the Oath of Supremacy. What ſays that
Oath? We ſwear, that <hi>The King is the only Supreme Governour
within this Realm, and Dominions.</hi> He is <hi>Supreme,</hi> and the <hi>onely
Supreme:</hi> and, truly, if he be <hi>Supreme,</hi> there is neither <hi>Major,</hi>
nor, <hi>Superior.</hi> I urge this the more, leſt any Perſon, by any
Miſconſtruction, or inference, which they might make from
ſomething, that hath been Acted by the Higher Powers, they
might draw ſome dangerous Inferences, or Conſequences to
colour, or ſhadow over thoſe Murtherous, and Traiterous
Acts, which afterwards they committed. They had no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
But as I told you, though I do ſet forth this, and declare
this to you, to let you know, that the King was immediately ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to God, and ſo was not puniſhable by any Perfon; yet,
let me tell you, there is that excellent Temperament in our
Laws, that, for all this, the King cannot rule, but by His
Laws. It preſerves the King, and his Perſon, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Rights.</p>
                           <p>There are three things, touching which the Law is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant:
<hi>Perſonae, Res, &amp; Actiones;</hi> Perſons, Things, and
Actions. For the <hi>Perſon</hi> of the King; He is the Supreme
Head, He is not puniſhable by any coercive Power: the Laws
provide for that. <hi>The King can do no wrong,</hi> it is a <hi>Rule</hi> of
Law, it is in our <hi>Law-books</hi> very frequent: 22d. of <hi>Edward
the Fourth</hi> Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> and many others. If he can do no
Wrong, He cannot be puniſhed for any wrong. The King, He
hath the infirmities, and weakneſs of a man: but he cannot
do any injury, at leaſt not conſiderable, in Perſon; He muſt
do it by Miniſters, Agents, Inſtruments. Now the Law,
though it provide for the King; yet if any of his Miniſters
do wrong, though by his command, they are puniſhable. The
King cannot arreſt a man, as he cannot be arreſted Himſelf:
but, if He arreſt me by another Man, I have remedy againſt
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56280:9"/>
this man, though not againſt the King: and ſo, He cannot
take away my <hi>Eſtate.</hi> This as to the <hi>Perſon</hi> of the King: He
is not to be touched: <hi>Touch not mine Anointed.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I come to <hi>Things.</hi> If the King claim a Right, the King
muſt ſue according to His Laws, the King is ſubject to the
Laws in that caſe, His Poſſeſſions ſhall be tried by Juries. If
He will try a man for His Fathers Death, you ſee he will try
them by the Laws. The Law is the Rule, and Square of His
actions, and by which He, Himſelf-is judged.</p>
                           <p>Then for <hi>Actions:</hi> that is, ſuch <hi>Actions,</hi> whereby Rights,
and Titles, are proſecuted, or recovered, the King cannot
judge in Perſon betwixt man and man, He does it by his
Judges, and upon Oath, and ſo in all caſes whatſoever; If
the King will have his Right, it muſt be brought before
His Judges. Though this is an <hi>Abſolute</hi> Monarchy: yet
this is ſo far from infringing the Peoples Rights; that the
People, as to their Properties, Liberties, and Lives, have as
great a priviledge, as the King. It is not the ſharing of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
that is for the Libertie, and Benefit of the People:
but it is, how they may have their Lives, and Liberties, and
Eſtates, ſafely ſecured under Government. And you know,
when the Fatneſs of the <hi>Olive</hi> was laid aſide, and we were Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by <hi>Brambles:</hi> theſe Brambles, they did not only tear
the <hi>Skin;</hi> but tore the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> to the very Bone.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> I have done in this Particular, to let you ſee, that
the Supreme Power, being in the King, the King is immediately
under God, owing his Power to none, but God. It is true
(bleſſed be God) we have as great Liberties, as any People
have in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> in the World: but let us own them,
where they are due. We have them by the Conceſſions
of Our Princes. Our Princes have granted them: and the
King, now: He in them hath granted them likewiſe.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Gentlmen,</hi> I have been a little too long in this, and yet I
cannot ſay, it is too long: becauſe it may clear miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding;
ſo many Poiſonous Opinions having gone abroad.
To come a little nearer. If we conſider; ſuppoſe there were
the Higheſt Authority; but, when we ſhall conſider this horrid
Murther (truly, I cannot almoſt ſpeak of it, but—<hi>Vox
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56280:10"/>
faucibus haeret.)</hi> When we ſhall conſider, that a few Members
of the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> thoſe, that had taken the Oath of <hi>Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy;</hi>
and thoſe that had taken the Oath of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> that
was to defend the King, and His Heirs, againſt all Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and Attempts, whatſoever, againſt His, and their Perſons,
Their Crowns and Dignities: not onely againſt the <hi>Pope</hi>'s
Sentence, as ſome would pretend; but, as otherwiſe, againſt
all Attempts, and Conſpiracies; not onely againſt His Perſon,
Crown, and Royal Dignity, nor <hi>Pope</hi>'s Sentence nor, onely
in order to the Profeſſion of Religion, but abſolutely or
otherwiſe, that is, whatſoever Attempts, by any power,
Authority, or Pretence whatſoever. I ſay, when a few Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> not an eighth part of them,
having taken theſe Oaths, ſhall aſſume upon themſelves an
Authority; an Authority, what to do? ſhall aſſume to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
an Authority to make Laws, which was never heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
Authority to make Laws: What Laws? a Law for
an <hi>High Court of Juſtice,</hi> a Law for lives, to ſentence mens
lives; And whoſe Life? the Life of their Sovereign: upon
ſuch a King, who, as to them, had not only redreſſed long
before, at the beginning of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> all Grievances, that
were, and were imaginable, taken away the <hi>Star-Chnmber,
High-Commiſſion</hi>-Court, and about <hi>Shipping:</hi> ſuch a King,
and after ſuch Conceſſions, that He had made in the Iſle of
<hi>Wight;</hi> when He had granted ſo much, that was more than
the People would have deſired. When theſe few <hi>Commons</hi>
not onely without, but excluding the reſt of the <hi>Commons;</hi>
not onely without, but excluding the reſt, but rejecting the
<hi>Lords</hi> too, that then ſat: when theſe <hi>few Commons</hi> ſhall take
upon them this Authority, and, by colour of this, their King,
Soveraign, Liege Lord, ſhall be ſentenced, put to Death; and
that put to Death, even as their King, and ſentenced as their
King; put to Death as their King, and this before His own
Door, even before that Place, where He uſed in <hi>Royal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>
to hear Embaſſadors, to have His Honourable Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments:
that this King ſhall be thus put to Death at
Noon-day, it is ſuch an Aggravation of Villany; that, truly,
I cannot tell what to ſay. No ſtory, that ever was, I do not
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56280:10"/>
think any <hi>Romance,</hi> any Fabulous <hi>Tragedy,</hi> can produce the
like. <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> If any Perſon ſhall now come, and ſhroud
himſelf under this pretended Authority, or ſuch a pretended
Authority, you muſt know, that this is ſo far from an Excuſe,
that it is an Height of Aggravation. The Court of <hi>Common-Pleas</hi>
is the Common Shop for Juſtice: in that Court an appeal
is brought for Murther, which ought to have been in the <hi>King's
Bench,</hi> the Court gives Judgment, the Party is condemned,
and executed: in this Caſe, it is Murther in them, that exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted;
becauſe they had no lawful Authority. I ſpeak this
to you, to ſhew you, that no man can ſhroud himſelf, by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of any ſuch falſe, or pretended, Authority. I have but
one thing more to add to you upon this head; and that is
(which I ſhould have ſaid at firſt) If two, or more, do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs,
or Imagine the King's Death; if ſome of them go on ſo
far, as to Conſullation; if others of them go further, they ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and execute, put to Death: in this Caſe they are all
Guilty; the firſt Conſultation was Treaſon. I have no more
to add, but one Particular, a few Words.</p>
                           <p>As you will have Bills preſented againſt thoſe; for Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
Imagining, Adjudging the King: ſo poſſibly you may
have Bils preſented againſt ſome of thoſe for Levying War
againſt the King: Levying of War, which is another Branch
of the <hi>State</hi> of 25th. of <hi>Edward the Third.</hi> It was but De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarative
of the Common Law: it was no new Law. By that
Law it was treaſon to <hi>Levy War</hi> againſt the King. But to le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
War againſt the Kings Authority, you muſt know is Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
too. If men will take up Armes upon any Publick pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence;
if it be to expulſe Aliens; if but to pull out Privy
Councellours; if it be, but againſt any Particular Laws, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
Religion, to pull down Encloſures: in all theſe caſes, If
Perſons have aſſembled themſelves, in a Warlike manner, to
do any of theſe Acts; this is Treaſon, and within that Branch
of Levying War againſt the King. This was adjudged in the
late Kings Time in <hi>Berſtead</hi>'s caſe, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s <hi>Henry</hi>
the <hi>Eighth</hi>'s, former Times, King <hi>Jame</hi>'s Time: much more;

come to be preſented to you, you know what the Laws are. To
conclude, you are now to enquire of Blood, of Royal Blood,
of Sacred Blood; Blood like that of the <hi>Saints</hi> under the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi>
crying <hi>Quouſque, Domine? How long, Lord, &amp;c.</hi> This
Blood crys for Vengeance, and it will not be appeaſed without
a Bloody Sacrifice.</p>
                           <p>Remember but this, and I have done: I ſhall not preſs you
upon your Oaths; you are Perſons of Honour; you all know
the Obligation of an Oath. This I will ſay, that he, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceals,
or favours the guilt of Blood, takes it upon himſelf;
wilfully, knowingly, takes it upon himſelf. And we know, that,
when the <hi>Jews</hi> ſaid, <hi>Let his blood be on us and our ſeed,</hi> it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
to them, and their Poſterity, to this day,
<hi>God ſave the King.</hi> Amen, Amen.</p>

                  <p>There is no anſwer but what the Law di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects.
It is the ſame with you, as with all others, or as I
would deſire, if I were in your condition. You muſt plead <hi>Not
guilty:</hi> or, if you confeſs <hi>guilty,</hi> there muſt be <hi>Judgment</hi> upon
your confeſſion. The ſame <hi>Rule</hi> for one, muſt be for another.</p>

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56280:13"/>
you go otherwiſe (as I told you before) it will be, as if you
pleaded not at all, and then <hi>Judgment</hi> will paſs againſt you.
The Law gives the words, frames your Anſwer, it is none elſe,
but the Laws, <hi>Guilty,</hi> or <hi>Not Guilty.</hi>

had, at the time of committing the ſaid Treaſon, or at any time
ſithence. If you find, that he is <hi>Not guilty;</hi> you ſhall enquire,
whether he did fly for it: if you find, that he fled for it, you ſhall
enquire of his Goods, and Chattels, as if you had found him
<hi>Guilty:</hi> if you find, that he is <hi>Not guilty,</hi> nor that he did fly,
you ſhall ſay ſo, and no more. And take heed to your <hi>Evidence.</hi>

                  <stage>in theſe words.</stage>
                  <p>MAY it pleaſe Your Lordſhips, we bring before your
Lordſhips, into Judgment this day, the <hi>Murtherers of
a King.</hi> A man would think the Laws of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Men,</hi> had
ſo fully ſecured theſe <hi>Sacred</hi> Perſons, that the <hi>Sons of
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iolence</hi> ſhould never approach to hurt them. For <hi>(My Lord)</hi>
the very <hi>Thoughts</hi> of ſuch an Attempt hath ever been preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by all <hi>Laws,</hi> in <hi>all Ages,</hi> and <hi>all Nations</hi> of the World, as
a moſt unpardonable Treaſon. <hi>My Lord,</hi> This is that, that
brought the two <hi>Eunuchs</hi> in the <hi>Perſian</hi>-Court to their juſt
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56280:22"/>
Deſtruction: <hi>Voluerunt inſurgere;</hi> ſaies the <hi>Text:</hi> and yet that
was enough to <hi>Attain</hi> them. And ſo <hi>(My Lord)</hi> it was
by the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws too, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> obſerves; <hi>Qui deliberant,
deſciverunt.</hi> To <hi>Doubt,</hi> or <hi>Heſitate,</hi> in a Point of <hi>Allegiance,</hi>
is direct <hi>Treaſon,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtaſie.</hi> And upon this Ground it is,
that the <hi>Statute,</hi> upon which your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> are now to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
hath theſe expreſs Words; <hi>If a man doth Compaſs, or I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine
the Death of the King,</hi> &amp;c. Kings, who are <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents
upon Earth,</hi> have thus far a kind of Reſemblance of
the <hi>Divine</hi> Majeſty; that their Subjects ſtand accountable to
Them for the <hi>very Thoughts</hi> of their Hearts. Not, that any
Man can know the <hi>Heart,</hi> ſave God alone; but becauſe when
the <hi>Wicked</hi> Heart breaks out into any <hi>open</hi> Expreſſions, by
which it may be judged, 'tis the <hi>Thoughts</hi> of the Heart,
which makes the Treaſon: the <hi>Overt-Act</hi> is but the <hi>Evidence</hi>
of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My Lords,</hi> This Care, and Caution, is not ſo to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood;
as if it were the <hi>Single</hi> Intereſt of <hi>One</hi> Royal Perſon
only. The Law doth wiſely judge, and foreſee, that upon the
<hi>Life</hi> of the King depends the <hi>Laws,</hi> and <hi>Liberties,</hi> the <hi>Eſtates</hi>
and <hi>Properties,</hi> the <hi>Wealth,</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> the <hi>Religion,</hi> and in Sum,
the <hi>Glory</hi> of the Nation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My Lords,</hi> This Judgment of the Law ha's been verified
by a <hi>ſad</hi> Experience: for when that <hi>Bleſſed King</hi> (whoſe
<hi>Blood</hi> we are now making <hi>Inquiſition</hi> for) was <hi>untimely</hi> taken
away, <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> both lay buried in the <hi>ſame</hi> Grave
with Him: and there they had ſlept ſtill; if the <hi>miraculous</hi>
Return of Our Gracious <hi>Sovereign</hi> had not given them a new
<hi>Reſurrection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My Lords,</hi> My Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> in his <hi>Comment</hi> upon this
<hi>Statute,</hi> ha's one Conceit, which is ſomewhat <hi>ſtrange;</hi> I am
ſure it is very <hi>new:</hi> he ſeems to think, that it would have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the <hi>Perfection</hi> of this <hi>Law;</hi> if there had been a time
limited for the <hi>Party</hi> to be accuſed. But certainly the work
of this Day has quite conſuted that <hi>Imagination.</hi> For here is
a <hi>Treaſon,</hi> that has ſo long <hi>out-faced</hi> the <hi>Law,</hi> and the <hi>Juſtice</hi>
of this Kingdom; that, if there had been any time of <hi>Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
in the <hi>Statute,</hi> there would have been no <hi>Time,</hi> nor
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56280:23"/>
                     <hi>Place,</hi> left for <hi>Puniſhment.</hi> And, if this Treaſon had but once
grown up to an <hi>Impunity,</hi> it might perhaps have drawn the
<hi>Guilt</hi> of that <hi>Innocent</hi> Blood, and with it the <hi>Vengeance</hi> due to
it, upon the whole Nation.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Scope</hi> of this <hi>Iudictment</hi> is, <hi>for the Compaſſing the Death
of the King:</hi> the reſt of the <hi>Indictment,</hi> as the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurping Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
over the King</hi>'s <hi>Perſon,</hi> the <hi>Aſſembling, Sitting, Judging,</hi>
and <hi>Killing</hi> of the King, are but ſo many ſeveral <hi>Overt-Acts</hi>
to prove the <hi>Intention</hi> of the Heart. We are not bound (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
favour) to prove every one of theſe againſt <hi>every</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Perſon, who is <hi>Indicted:</hi> for he, that is in at <hi>one,</hi> is guilty in
<hi>Law</hi> of all reſt, as much, as if he had ſtruck the <hi>Fatal
Stroke</hi> it ſelf. Nay (under favour) if we can prove any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Overt-Act,</hi> beſides what is lai'd in the <hi>Indictment,</hi> as the
<hi>encouraging</hi> of the <hi>Souldiers</hi> to cry out, <hi>Juſtice, Juſtice;</hi> or
<hi>Preaching</hi> to them to go in <hi>this Work</hi> as <hi>Godly,</hi> and <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious;</hi>
or any other act of all that <hi>Catalogue</hi> of <hi>Villanies,</hi> for
which the <hi>Story</hi> will be for ever <hi>Infamous:</hi> this may be given
in <hi>Evidence</hi> to prove the <hi>Compaſſing,</hi> and <hi>Imagining</hi> the King's
Death. The concluſion of this <hi>Indictment</hi> alledges the <hi>Fact</hi>
done to be <hi>to the great Diſpleaſure of Almighty God,</hi> and <hi>to the
great Diſgrace of the People of</hi> England. A <hi>Truth</hi> ſo clear,
and known; that it can neither be <hi>heightned</hi> by any <hi>Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
or <hi>leſſend</hi> by any <hi>Excuſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Fact</hi> it ſelf, with the <hi>Manner</hi> of it, I ſhall not
need to open it at large: for theſe things were not done in a
<hi>Corner;</hi> every <hi>true Engliſh</hi> Heart ſtill keeps within it ſelf a
bleeding <hi>Regiſter</hi> of this <hi>Story</hi> only <hi>(my Lords)</hi> in the way
to our <hi>Evidence,</hi> with your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> favour, this I think, may
be fit to be ſaid.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, for the year 1648. (for that was the <hi>Fatal</hi> year of
this King, and beyond that year we ſhall not now enquire) I
ſay whatſoever, in the <hi>Year</hi> 1648. could have been done by a
<hi>Parliament</hi> to ſave the <hi>Life</hi> of a King, was done in this <hi>Caſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They opened the way to a <hi>Treaty</hi> in ſpight of the <hi>Army;</hi>
and, while theſe Sons of <hi>Zerviah,</hi> who were too hard for them,
were engaged in <hi>Service,</hi> in the <hi>Remoter</hi> Parts, they haſtened
the <hi>Treaty</hi> as much, as was poſſible: the <hi>Debater</hi> upon His
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56280:23"/>
Majeſtie's <hi>Conceſſions</hi> were Voted a <hi>good ground for Peace:</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the <hi>Remonſtrances</hi> of the <hi>Army</hi> ſtill flew about
their <hi>Ears,</hi> and notwithſtanding the <hi>Oppoſitions</hi> of a fearful,
and unbelieving Party of the <hi>Houſe-of Commons;</hi> whom the
<hi>Army</hi> had frighted into an <hi>Awful,</hi> and a <hi>Slaviſh</hi> Dependance
upon them. And, when nothing elſe could be done <hi>for</hi> Him,
they were ſo true to the <hi>Obligations</hi> they lay under, that they
reſolved to fall <hi>with</hi> Him: and did ſo. For the <hi>Army,</hi> who
ſaw the <hi>Treaty proceed</hi> ſo faſt, made as great haſt to <hi>break it.</hi>
They ſeize upon the bleſſed <hi>Perſon</hi> of our Sacred King by
<hi>Force,</hi> and bring Him to <hi>London;</hi> and here they force the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
ſhut out</hi> ſome <hi>Members, impriſon</hi> others: and then
called this wretched little Company, which was left, a <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
By this, and before they had taken upon them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the
Boldneſs to diſſolve the Houſe of <hi>Peers,</hi> they paſs a <hi>Law,</hi> and
Erect, forſooth! an <hi>High Court of Juſtice,</hi> as they call it, a
<hi>Shambles</hi> of Juſtice; appoint <hi>Judges, Advocates, Officers,</hi> and
<hi>Miniſters;</hi> ſit upon the <hi>Life</hi> of the King. Now they <hi>Speak
out,</hi> and <hi>Expound</hi> their own <hi>Declarations,</hi> and tell us what
that was, which before they had demanded in obſcure Terms,
when they called for <hi>Juſtice</hi> againſt <hi>all Delinquents.</hi> Now
they ſpeak plainly what they mean, and call this bleſſed King,
this glorious <hi>Saint,</hi> the <hi>grand Delinquent:</hi>
                     <q>—Haec Acies victum factura Nocentem eſt.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>My Lords, When they had thus proceeded to appoint their
<hi>Judges, Officers,</hi> and <hi>Court,</hi> then they call <hi>this</hi> Perſon, their
onely <hi>Liege</hi> Lord and Soveraign to the <hi>Bar,</hi> and, by a <hi>formal
Pegeantry</hi> of Juſtice, proceed to <hi>Sit</hi> upon Him, <hi>Arraign, Try,
Sentence, Condemn,</hi> and <hi>Kill</hi> (I had almoſt ſaid <hi>Crucifie)</hi> Him,
whom they could not but know to be their <hi>King.</hi> And all
this againſt the <hi>cleareſt</hi> Light, the <hi>ſharpeſt</hi> Checks, and moſt
<hi>through</hi> Convictions of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> that ever men reſiſted. And
yet, in this <hi>moment</hi> of time, ſuch was the <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene,</hi>
of our Gracious Soveraign; that the <hi>People</hi> followed
Him with <hi>Tears</hi> in their <hi>Eyes,</hi> and <hi>Acclamations</hi> in their
<hi>Mouths, God ſave the King;</hi> even then, when the <hi>Souldiers</hi>
were ready to fire upon them, who did either <hi>look</hi> Sadly, or
<hi>ſpeak</hi> Affectionately. And yet it will appear upon our <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:56280:24"/>
too; that ſo few of the very <hi>Common Souldiers</hi> could be
brought to approve theſe <hi>Proceedings,</hi> or to cry out <hi>Juſtice;</hi>
that their <hi>Officers</hi> were fain by <hi>Money,</hi> or <hi>Blows,</hi> or both, to
bring a great many to it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My Lords,</hi> The <hi>Actors</hi> in this <hi>Tragedy</hi> were <hi>many, very</hi>
many, <hi>ſo</hi> many; that ſure their Name is <hi>Legion,</hi> or rather
many <hi>Legions.</hi> And certainly <hi>(my Lords)</hi> when we ſhall
conſider the <hi>Thing,</hi> that they have done, we cannot but look
upon it, as a <hi>Villany,</hi> which had in it all the <hi>Ingredients</hi> to
make it deteſtable, that it was poſſible for the <hi>Counſel</hi> of <hi>Men;</hi>
or <hi>Devils</hi> either; to put together. But yet, if any thing can
be of a deeper Dy, then the <hi>Guilt</hi> of that <hi>Sacred Blood,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they ſtand <hi>Polluted,</hi> me thinks, their <hi>Impudence</hi> ſhould
make them more odious; then their <hi>Treaſon.</hi> It was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Anointed,</hi> in the Name of the <hi>Lord.</hi> It
was the Murther of a moſt bleſſed, and beloved <hi>Prince,</hi> in
the Name of His <hi>People.</hi> Him, whom they had taken the
tranſcendent Boldneſs to <hi>impriſon;</hi> as the Author of the <hi>War,</hi>
they put to <hi>Death,</hi> becauſe He would have been the Author of
our <hi>Peace:</hi> and that with ſo much <hi>Scorn,</hi> and <hi>Indignity,</hi> that
ſome of them were not aſhamed to <hi>ſpit</hi> in the <hi>Face</hi> of our
Lord, and Sovereign. And when they had thus <hi>quenched
the Light of</hi> Iſrael: <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> and <hi>Confuſion,</hi> did over-ſpread
the face of the <hi>Land:</hi> many poor <hi>Subjects</hi> at <hi>Home,</hi> and ſome
<hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>Foreign</hi> Nations, at the very <hi>News</hi> of it fell
down <hi>Dead;</hi> as if this excellent King had been in a <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi>
as well as a <hi>Religious</hi> ſence, <hi>the Breath of our Noſtrils,</hi> the
<hi>Anointed of the Lord,</hi> who was <hi>taken in their Pits.</hi> The
<hi>Judges, Officers,</hi> and other Immediate <hi>Actors</hi> in this preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>Court,</hi> were in number about fourſcore. Of theſe ſome
four, or five, and twenty are dead, <hi>and gone to their own place.</hi>
The <hi>God of Recompences</hi> hath taken the matter ſo far into His
Own Hands: and who knows, but that it might be one dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
part of His <hi>Vengeance,</hi> that they died in <hi>Peace?</hi> Some ſix,
or ſeven of them, who are thought to have ſinned with leſs
<hi>Malice,</hi> have their <hi>Lives</hi> ſpared, indeed, but are like to be
brought to a ſevere <hi>Repentance</hi> by future <hi>Penalties.</hi> Some
eighteen, or nineteen, have <hi>fled</hi> from Juſtice, and <hi>wander</hi> to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56280:24"/>
and fro, about the World with the <hi>Mark</hi> of <hi>Cain</hi> upon them,
are <hi>Perpetual trembling,</hi> leſt every <hi>Eye</hi> that ſees them, and every
<hi>Hand</hi> that meets them, ſhould fall upon them. Twenty nine
Perſons do now expect your <hi>Juſtice.</hi> Amongſt them the firſt,
that is brought, is the <hi>Priſoner</hi> at the <hi>Bar,</hi> and he deſerves to
be the firſt; for, if any Perſon, now left alive ought to be
ſtiled the <hi>Conductour, Leader,</hi> and <hi>Captain</hi> of all this Work,
that's the <hi>Man.</hi> He <hi>(my Lord)</hi> brought the King up a <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner</hi>
from <hi>Windſor,</hi> but <hi>how,</hi> and in <hi>what manner,</hi> with how
<hi>little Duty,</hi> nay, with how <hi>little Civility</hi> to a common Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
you will hear in time. He <hi>Sate</hi> upon Him, <hi>Sentenced</hi>
Him, he <hi>Signed</hi> the <hi>Warrant,</hi> firſt to <hi>call that Court</hi> together,
then the <hi>bloody Warrant</hi> to cut off His Sacred Head. Againſt
him, as againſt all the reſt, our <hi>Evidence</hi> will be of two <hi>ſorts:</hi>
Witneſſes, <hi>Viva voce;</hi> that ſhall firſt prove to your <hi>Lordſhips,</hi>
that every Perſon now in <hi>Queſtion</hi> did <hi>ſit</hi> in that <hi>Court,</hi> when
their King <hi>ſtood,</hi> as a <hi>Priſoner,</hi> at the Bar. We ſhall prove that
the <hi>Precept,</hi> by which this pretended <hi>Court</hi> was ſummoned, was
not obeyed, and executed, till it had had the <hi>hands,</hi> and
<hi>ſeals,</hi> of moſt of the pretended <hi>Judges:</hi> among the reſt, the
<hi>hand</hi> of the Priſoner at the <hi>Bar</hi> will be found there. We ſhall
prove his <hi>hand</hi> to the <hi>bloody Warrant,</hi> for ſevering the Sacred
Head of our Bleſſed Sovereign from the Body, and then ſome
<hi>Circumſtances</hi> of his Malice, and of his Demeanour. And
after we have done with our Witneſſes <hi>Viva voce,</hi> if we have
occaſion to uſe <hi>Records</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> we ſhall ſhew them
too; for we have the <hi>Originals,</hi> or authentick <hi>Copies.</hi> But
now we ſhall proceed to our <hi>Evidence.</hi>

                     <hi>My Lords,</hi> The ſervice of this Day doth
call to my Memory the <hi>Story</hi> of good King <hi>Amaziah.</hi> We read
in <hi>Holy Writ,</hi> that his Father, King <hi>Joaſh,</hi> was murthered,
and murthered by His own Subjects: but we read further, that,
when <hi>Amaziah</hi> had regained the Crown, was ſettled in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
He ſlew thoſe, that ſlew His Father. He did go
downe into <hi>Edom,</hi> the <hi>Valley of Salt,</hi> and there He did ſlay ten
thouſand. The work of this Day doth very much reſemble that
Action. Our Good, and Gratious King, His Father of bleſſed
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56280:25"/>
Memory, and our Father, His natural, and our politick Father,
to whom our natural Allegiance was due was <hi>murthered,</hi> and by
His own Subjects. But, <hi>My Lords,</hi> this was not a <hi>National</hi>
Crime: and our Good, and Gratious Sovereign hath done us that
Honour, and Right to vindicate us in <hi>Forreign</hi> Nations; and now
He is come <hi>Home</hi> in Power, and Glory, He does continue in the
ſame Mind: that's the Reaſon, we are not now ſlain by thouſands;
but that thoſe <hi>Miſcreants</hi> are gathered up here, and there, that
did commit the Offence, and would have involved the Nation in a
common Infamy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of the <hi>Jury,</hi> Your time to enquire of this Matter
is precious, more pretious then my Words; elſe I would repeat to
you the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>Tragedy;</hi> at leaſt that <hi>Summary,</hi> that
was entred in the <hi>Black Book,</hi> or the <hi>Journals</hi> of that they then
called a <hi>Parliament.</hi> It ſhall ſuffice to tell you, and that moſt
truly; that it was but an handful of men in reſpect of the whole
<hi>Nation,</hi> that did contrive, and deſign, this damnable and traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Plot, to ſubvert the <hi>Laws,</hi> and change the <hi>Government</hi> of
this well-governed <hi>Nation.</hi> In proſecution of which they did caſt
abroad, and ſpread forth, <hi>Jeſuitical Maxims,</hi> Damnable, and
Diabolical <hi>Principles,</hi> to intoxicate the People; and, when their
Heads were troubled, they were eaſily lead into Arms; where,
after ſome time, they grew drunk with Succeſſes: and when they
had drunk too much of the Loyal Blood of the People, then they
thirſted for the Royal Blood alſo. I do confeſs, we read in <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
that Kings have before this time been murthered: ſome in our
Nation, as King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, and <hi>Edward</hi> the Third:
and in other Nations. But the Actors of thoſe Murthers were
modeſt to theſe. They did it in Private; theſe in the Face of the
<hi>Sun,</hi> and the <hi>People:</hi> but it was thoſe People, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> they
had corrupted with Shares in their Robberies, and Villanies. They
pretended it was in a way of <hi>Juſtice:</hi> but, you muſt know, no
<hi>Juſtice</hi> can be executed upon the Perſon of the King; <hi>Touch not
mine Anointed,</hi> ſaith God himſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My Lords,</hi> I do read in the <hi>Roman</hi> Story; that both amongſt
them, and other Nations, there was no <hi>Law</hi> againſt <hi>Parricide.</hi>
It was not thought that any man was ſo unnatural, and Devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
to deſtroy his Father. But we do find amongſt the <hi>Romanes</hi>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:56280:25"/>
ſuch a Fact was committed, and then they were at a loſs to puniſh
it. The way was this, that they found out: the <hi>Offendour</hi>
they ſewed into a Mail of Leather ſo cloſe, that no Water could
get in; when they had done, they threw him into the <hi>Sea:</hi> by this
denoting; the <hi>Offendour</hi> was not worthy to Tread upon the
<hi>Ground,</hi> nor to Breath in the <hi>Air,</hi> nor to have the benefit of any
of the four <hi>Elements,</hi> nor the uſe of any of God's <hi>Creatures:</hi>
and ſo he ſtarved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gentlemen, Parricide,</hi> and <hi>Regicide,</hi> differ not in <hi>Nature,</hi> but
in <hi>Degree. Parricide</hi> is the killing of the Father of <hi>one,</hi> or a
<hi>few,</hi> Perſons; <hi>Regicide,</hi> the Killing the Father of a <hi>Countrey.</hi>
What Puniſhment then is ſuitable to this Offence? Gentlemen, The
<hi>Priſoner</hi> at the <hi>Bar</hi> is accuſed of this Offence, and now to be Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by you: but, before we enter upon the Evidence, I muſt, with
the leave of the <hi>Court,</hi> inform you; That, though the <hi>Indictment</hi>
contains many <hi>Circumſtances</hi> and <hi>Gradations,</hi> in the Treaſon;
yet the <hi>Imagining,</hi> and <hi>Compaſſing</hi> the Death of our late Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,
is the Treaſon, to which we ſhall apply our <hi>Evidence:</hi> this
being, both by the <hi>Common-Law,</hi> and by the <hi>Statute</hi> of the <hi>25th</hi>
of <hi>Edward the 3d.</hi> the Principal Treaſon to be enquired of. And
the other Circumſtances in the <hi>Indictment</hi> are but ſo many matters
to prove the <hi>Overt-Act.</hi> The <hi>Conſultations,</hi> the Aſſuming Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to Try, and Condemn the King. The Aſſault upon him, and the
Fatal Blow, that was given him, are but ſo many Demonſtrations,
and open Acts, proving the firſt Treaſonable Deſign of the
Heart.</p>
                  <p>It will be enough for you, and ſo my Lords will tell you; if
we prove the Treaſon it ſelf, which is the <hi>Compaſſing,</hi> and <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining</hi>
the Death of the King: though we fail in ſome of the
<hi>Circumſtances</hi> laid in the <hi>Indictment.</hi> I do not ſpeak this, as
if we ſhould fail in any: but it is not neceſſary to prove them all,
if we prove any, you are to find the Priſoner <hi>Guilty.</hi> I am not
willing to hold your Lordſhips too long in the <hi>Porch;</hi> but deſire
to deſcend into the <hi>Body</hi> of the Buſineſs: and ſo we ſhall call our
<hi>Witneſſes,</hi> and doubt not, but to prove, that this Man at the <hi>Bar</hi>
was the firſt, and not the leaſt of theſe <hi>Offendours.</hi>

                  <p>Do you know any thing more of the <hi>Priſoner</hi> at
the <hi>Bar?</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. <hi>Nutley.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>Thus much I know concerning the <hi>Priſoner</hi>
at the <hi>Bar,</hi> my <hi>Lord.</hi> The firſt day that they ſate in publick,
was (as I remember) the 20th. of <hi>Jan.</hi> 1648. Some few
days afore that, there was a Committee, that ſate in the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer-Chamber,</hi>
and of that Committee the Priſoner at the Bar
was one of the Members. I do remember well, it was in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they were lighting of Candles; they were ſomewhat private.
This Gentleman was there, I ſaw him: for through the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Mr. <hi>Phelps,</hi> who was then Clerk to that Committee,
I was admitted, pretending firſt to ſpeak with the ſaid Mr.
<hi>Phelps,</hi> and that I had ſome Buſineſs with him, and ſo (as I
ſaid before) I was admitted into the Committee-Chamber.
Being there, I did obſerve ſome Paſſages fall from the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
at the Bar; the words were to this purpoſe. He was
making a Narrative of ſome Diſcourſes, that paſſed between
his late Majeſty and himſelf, in coming between <hi>Windſor</hi> and
<hi>London,</hi> or <hi>Hurſt-Caſtle,</hi> I know not well whether. <hi>My Lord</hi>
that Paſſage, that I obſerved to fall from him in that Diſcourſe,
was this. He ſaid, That the King, as He ſate in the Coach
with him, was importunate to know what they intended to
do with Him.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Harriſon.</speaker>
                  <p>In the Coach was it?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. <hi>Nutley.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>Yea, Sir, it was in the <hi>Coach.</hi> He told the reſt
of the company (as I ſaid before) that the King asked, <hi>What
do they intend to do with me? Whether to murther me, or no?</hi>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:56280:27"/>
And I ſaid to Him, <hi>There was no ſuch intention, as to kill Him
we have no ſuch thoughts. But</hi> (ſaith He) <hi>the Lord hath reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
you for a publick Example of Juſtice.</hi> There is one word
more, <hi>My Lords;</hi> and that is this, which I heard from this
<hi>Priſoner</hi> at the <hi>Bar;</hi> That the reaſon, and end of their Meeting
together, at that <hi>Committee,</hi> was <hi>concerning the Charge.</hi> So much
I obſerved. It was concerning the Contracting of the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment.</hi>
I obſerved, that ſome found fault with the length of
that, as it was drawn. They were offering ſome reaſons to
Contract it, and I heard this Priſoner at the <hi>Bar</hi> vent this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
<hi>Gentlemen, It will be good for us to</hi> blacken <hi>Him, what
we can; Pray, let us</hi> blacken <hi>Him:</hi> or words to that Purpoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I am ſure <hi>Blacken</hi> was his word.</p>

Point of the <hi>Indictment</hi> is for <hi>Compaſſing, Imagining,</hi> and
<hi>Contriving</hi> the Death of his late Majeſty of Glorious Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
There lies the Treaſon. So ſaies the <hi>Statute</hi> of the 25th.
Ed. 3d. It hath nothing of <hi>Killing</hi> the King there, but of <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining,</hi>
and <hi>Compaſſing</hi> the Death of the King. The going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it, that's the Treaſon: as hath been learnedly opened to
you. The reſt are but <hi>Overt-Acts.</hi> If there be ſuch an <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,</hi>
or <hi>Compaſſing</hi> the Death of the King once declared,
though no fruit at all follow, it is <hi>Treaſon.</hi> Here certainly
you have a very full <hi>Evidence</hi> given. We ſhew you a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation;</hi>
this is one <hi>Overt-Act,</hi> which would do the work, if

Submiſſion to my Lords; the <hi>Juſtices)</hi> if they had <hi>adviſed,</hi>
and gone no further: that had been Treaſon in the <hi>Letter</hi> of
the Law. They Convened, and met together, and ſuppoſe
then, they had abſolved, and acquitted him; do you think
they had abſolved themſelves from Treaſon? With reverence
be it ſpoken: if they had <hi>acquitted</hi> him, they had been guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Treaſon. <hi>Aſſuming a Power</hi> to put the King to Death,
is an <hi>Overt-Act,</hi> declaring ſuch an Imagination, You ſee this
Priſoner was no ordinary Actour in it: his Hand is in at all
Games, Taking of Him, Impriſoning of Him, bringing Him
to <hi>London,</hi> and ſetting Guards on Him. You ſee alſo his
Malice, <hi>Let us</hi> Blacken <hi>Him:</hi> for they knew His <hi>Innocency</hi> would
Shine forth; unleſs it was <hi>blackened</hi> by their Imputations.
He Sate many times, as your hear, and <hi>Sentenced</hi> Him, and
Aſſented to that <hi>Sentence</hi> by ſtanding up, and likewiſe by
Concluding the <hi>Cataſtrophe</hi> of that ſad beginning of Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
his making a <hi>Warrant</hi> for his <hi>Execution,</hi> and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                     <hi>My Lords,</hi> The matter, that hath been offered
to you, as it was touched, was not a thing done in a Corner.
I believe the ſound of it hath been in moſt Nations. I believe
the Hearts of ſome have felt the Terrours of that Preſence of
God, that was with his Servants in thoſe days: (However it
ſeemeth good to him, to ſuffer this <hi>Turn</hi> to come on us) and are
Witneſſes, that the things were not done in a Corner. I have
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56280:31"/>
deſired, as in the ſight of him, that ſearcheth all hearts, whileſt
this hath been done, to wait, and receive from him Convictions
upon my own Conſcience, though I have ſought it with Tears
many a time, and Prayers, over and over, to that God, to whom
you, and all Nations, are leſs than a Drop of water of the
Bucket: and to this moment, I have received rather Aſſurance
of it, and that the things that have been done, as aſtoniſhing on
one hand; I do believe, e're it be long, it will be made known
from Heaven; There was more from God, than men are aware
of. I do profeſs, that I would not offer, of my ſelf, the leaſt
Injury to the pooreſt Man or Woman that goes upon the Earth.
That I have humbly to offer is this to your Lordſhips; You
know what a Conteſt hath been in theſe Nations for many
years. Divers of thoſe that ſit upon the <hi>Bench,</hi> were formerly
as Active—</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Harriſon.</speaker>
                  <p>I followed not my own Judgment. I did
what I did, as out of Conſcience to the Lord. For when I found
thoſe that were as the Apple of mine Eye, to turn aſide, I did
loath them, and ſuffered Impriſonment many years. Rather,
then to turn, as many did, that did put their Hands to this
Plough: I choſe rather to be ſeparated from Wife, and Family,
than to have Compliance with them: though it was ſaid, <hi>Sit
at my Right Hand,</hi> and ſuch kind of Expreſſions. Thus I have
given a little poor Teſtimony, that I have not been doing things
in a <hi>Corner,</hi> or from my ſelf. May be, I might be a little miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken:
but I did it all according to the beſt of my underſtanding;
deſiring to make the Revealed Will of God in his <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
as a guide to me. I humbly conceive, That, what was
done, was done in the name of the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> that
what was done, was done by their Power, and Authority, and
I do humbly conceive, it is my Duty to offer unto you in the
beginning, that this <hi>Court,</hi> or any <hi>Court</hi> below the <hi>High Court
of Parliament</hi> hath no Juriſdiction of their Actions. Here are
many Learned in the Law, and, to ſhorten the Work, I deſire
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56280:31"/>
I may have the help of <hi>Councel</hi> Learned in the Laws, that may
in this matter give me a little aſſiſtance to offer thoſe Grounds,
that the Law of the Land doth offer. I ſay what was done was
done by the Authority of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> which was then the
<hi>Supreme</hi> Authority, and that thoſe, that have Acted under them,
are not to be queſtioned by any Power leſs than them. And,
for that I conceive there is much out of the Laws to be ſhewed
to you, and many <hi>Preſidents</hi> alſo in the <hi>Caſe.</hi> Much is to be
offered to you in that, according to the Laws of the Nations,
that was a due <hi>Parliament.</hi> Thoſe <hi>Commiſſions</hi> were iſſued
forth, and what was done, was done by their Power. And
whereas it hath been ſaid, we did Aſſume, and Uſurp an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
I ſay, this was done rather in the Fear of the Lord.</p>

in the Aſſembly of <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> Will you make God the Author

                     <hi>Chriſtians</hi> muſt not hear this. We will allow you, to ſay for
your own <hi>Defence</hi> what you can. And we have, with a great
deal of Patience, ſuffered you to ſally out: wherein you have
not gone about ſo much for Extenuation of your Crimes, as to
Juſtifie them, to fall upon others, and to Blaſpheme God, and
commit a new Treaſon. For your having of <hi>Councel;</hi> This is
the reaſon for allowing of <hi>Councel;</hi> when a man would Plead
any thing, becauſe he would Plead it in <hi>Formality, Councel</hi> is

                  </speaker>
                  <p>I have two things to offer to you, to ſay for
my Defence in Matter of <hi>Law.</hi> One is; That this, that hath
been done, was done by a <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> by the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
of <hi>England</hi> aſſembled in <hi>Parliament:</hi> and that being ſo,
whatever was done by their Commands; or their Authority, is
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56280:32"/>
not queſtionable by your <hi>Lordſhips;</hi> as being (as I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)
a Power Inferiour to that of an <hi>High Court</hi> of <hi>Parliament.</hi>
That's one. A ſecond is this; That what therefore any did
in obedience to that Power, and Authority, they are not to be
queſtioned for it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> otherwiſe we are in a moſt miſerable Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
bound to obey them, that are in Authority, and yet to be
puniſhed, if obeyed. We are not to Judg, what is lawful, or
what is unlawful. <hi>My Lords,</hi> Upon theſe two Points I do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
that thoſe, that are Learned in the Laws, may ſpeak too, on
my behalf. It concerns all my Countreymen. There are <hi>Caſes</hi>
alike to this, you know, in King <hi>Richard the Second</hi>'s Time,
wherein ſome Queſtion had been of what had been done by a
<hi>Parliament;</hi> and what followed upon it, I need not urge in it.
I hope it will ſeem good to you, that <hi>Councel</hi> may be aſſigned:
for it concerns all my Countreymen.</p>

               <sp>

They will cry you Out, and ſhame you.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Harriſon.</speaker>
                  <p>May be ſo, <hi>my Lords,</hi> ſome will: but I am
ſure others will not.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Sollicitor Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>Theſe two Points, <hi>my Lords,</hi> are but one,
and they are a new Treaſon at the Bar: for which he deſerves
to dy, if there were no other <hi>Indictment.</hi> It is the Malice of his
heart to the Dignity, and Crown of <hi>England.</hi> I ſay this is not
matter, for which <hi>Councel</hi> can be aſſigned. <hi>Councel</hi> cannot put
into Form that, which is not Matter Pleadable it ſelf. It
is ſo far from being true, that this was the Act of the Supreme
<hi>Parliament</hi> of the People of <hi>England,</hi> that there was nothing
received with more Heart-bleeding, than this Bloody Buſineſs.
But that the World may not be abuſed by the Inſinuations of
a man, who acts, as if he had a Spirit, and in truth is poſſeſſed,
I will ſay; That the <hi>Lords,</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> are not a <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi>
That the <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>Lords,</hi> cannot do any thing without
the <hi>Commons;</hi> Nor the <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> without the <hi>Lords,</hi>
Nor the <hi>Lords,</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> without the <hi>King,</hi> eſpecially
<hi>againſt</hi> the King. If they do, they muſt anſwer it with their
Head: for the King is not accountable to any Coercive Power.
And for the Priſoner to Juſtifie his Act, as if it were the Act
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56280:32"/>
of the <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> he is very much to be reproved.
Shall he pretend, that one Houſe, nay the eighth part of a
<hi>Houſe</hi> (for ſo it was) can Condemn a King: when both
<hi>Houſes</hi> cannot condemn one man in ſpight of the King? I
deſire, <hi>my Lords,</hi> it may paſs with a due Reproach, and a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
upon it.</p>

                  <speaker>
                     <hi>Lord</hi> Chief Baron.</speaker>
                  <p>It is true, your Queſtions are but one Point.
You pretend the <hi>Parliament</hi>'s Authority; and, when you come
to ſpeak of it, you ſay the <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> They were but
one <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Parliament.</hi> The <hi>Parliament?</hi> what is that? It is the
<hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Lords,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Commons.</hi> I would fain know of you, where
ever you read, by the light you ſay you have in your Conſcience,
that the <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>England</hi> were a <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> that
the <hi>Commons</hi> in <hi>Parliament</hi> uſed a Legiſlative power alone. Do
you call that a <hi>Parliament,</hi> that ſate, when the Houſe was <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,</hi>
as they call it, and was ſo much under the Awe of the
<hi>Army,</hi> who were then, but forty, or forty five at moſt? Then
you ſay, It was done by Authority of them. You muſt know,
where there is ſuch an Authority (which indeed is no Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
he that confirms ſuch an Authority, he Commits a double
offence; therefore conſider what your <hi>Plea</hi> is. If your <hi>Plea</hi>
were doubtfull, we ſhould, and ought, and would, our ſelves,
be of <hi>Councel</hi> for you. That, which you ſpeak concerning <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of your own Conſcience,</hi> remember, that it is ſaid in <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
that <hi>they ſhall think they did God good ſervice, when they
ſlay you,</hi> as it is in St. <hi>John.</hi> He hath a great deal of Charity,
that thinks that what you did was out of a Conſcientious <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</hi>
It was againſt the Light of noon-day, and common pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.
You make your ſelf a <hi>Sollicitor</hi> in the Buſineſs. <hi>Let us</hi>
blacken <hi>him, as much as we can.</hi> I have not touched at all
upon the <hi>Evidence.</hi> I will not urge it now. I ſay you juſtifie
it upon <hi>Convictions of Conſcience,</hi> and pretend it upon Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
A thing never known, or ſeen, under the Sun; that the
<hi>Commons,</hi> nay a few <hi>Commons</hi> alone, ſhould take upon them, and
call themſelves the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> We have been cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
enough by Names, and Words: there is no colour for what
you ſay. I do think, and hope, my Brethren will ſpeak to this
<hi>Caſe,</hi> that none of us do own that Convention, whatſoever
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56280:33"/>
it be, to be the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> There was another ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation:
at this Time, that this Pretended Authority uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
that Power; the <hi>Lords</hi> were then ſitting. You had not
taken this uſurped Power to diſſolve theſe <hi>Lords.</hi> No; you
did this Act in diſpight of the <hi>Lords,</hi> you had ſent up an <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance</hi>
to the <hi>Lords,</hi> and they rejected it, and thereupon theſe
<hi>Members</hi> took it upon themſelves. Amongſt thoſe there were
ſome <hi>Negatives,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Members</hi> were under the Awe, and
Power of your <hi>Forces</hi> at that time. What you Plead, the
<hi>Court</hi> are of Opinion, tends to the ſubverſion of the Laws; for
you to uſurp Power over the People without their Conſents, to
call this the <hi>People;</hi> We never knew the like before. But the
<hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>England</hi> was the <hi>King, Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons.</hi> For
you to ſpeak of this Power, and Juſtifie this Power, is an Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation
adding one Sin, and Treaſon, to another. We ſhall
tell you, that neither <hi>both Houſes</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> if they had
been there, not any <hi>ſingle Perſon, Community,</hi> not the <hi>People,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Collectively,</hi> or <hi>Repreſentatively,</hi> had any colour to have any
Coercive Power over their King. And this <hi>Plea,</hi> which you
have ſpoken of, it ought to be over-ruled, and not to ſtand
good.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Anneſley.</speaker>
                  <p>I do the more willingly ſpeak to this Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
becauſe I was one of thoſe, that ſhould have made up
that <hi>Parliament,</hi> that this Priſoner pretends to. I was one of
that <hi>Corrupt Majority</hi> (as they called it) that were put out of
the <hi>Houſe.</hi> He cannot forget, that at that time there were
<hi>Guards</hi> upon both <hi>Houſes</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> to attend them, that
were of their own appointment: and that thoſe <hi>Guards</hi> were
forcibly removed by the Priſoner at the Bar, and his Fellows:
and other <hi>Guards</hi> put there, who inſtead of being a Defence
unto them, when thoſe <hi>Commons</hi> ſtood at the Door, were by
them threatned. Yet the <hi>Lords,</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in
<hi>Parliament</hi> Aſſembled, a full Houſe of <hi>Commons,</hi> did reſolve, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
what was aforeſaid; that the Treaty in the Iſle
of <hi>Wight</hi> was a <hi>Ground for Peace.</hi> Afterwards the Major part
of the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Commons,</hi> having reſolved on this, ſent it up
to the <hi>Lords:</hi> that very day when they were Adjourned, there
were <hi>Forces</hi> drawn down to the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Commons Door,</hi> and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56280:33"/>
none ſuffered to come into the <hi>Houſe,</hi> but thoſe, that they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
All thoſe, that had a mind for Peace, that minded their
Duty, and Truſt, and Allegiance to their King, were ſeized on
by this Gentleman, and his Fellows. When this was done,
what did he, and thoſe Fellows do? They ſate, and put a check
upon all, that ſhould come in. None muſt come in, but thoſe,
that would renounce their Allegiance, and Duty to their King,
and the People, for whom they ſerved, and then declared againſt
that Vote, which had been paſſed upon <hi>Debate</hi> of twelve, or
fourteen hours, and then to call this an <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Commons,</hi> nay
the <hi>Supreme Authority of the Nation,</hi> he knows is againſt the
Laws of the Land. For the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Commons</hi> alone cannot ſo
much, as give an <hi>Oath.</hi> It hath not power of <hi>Judicature</hi> of
Life, and Death: this he knows well to be according to the
Laws of <hi>England.</hi> He knows, that no Authority, leſs then
an <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> can make a Law, and he knows an <hi>Act
of Parliament</hi> muſt be paſſed by the <hi>King, Lords,</hi> and <hi>Commons.</hi>
I wonder much to hear a Juſtification in this kind by one, that
knows the Laws of <hi>England</hi> ſo well. There will none of the
<hi>Court</hi> allow, that that was a <hi>Parliament.</hi> The Majority of
that <hi>Houſe</hi> did all diſavow it. Theſe things have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
diſcourſed of: I ſhall onely ſay, that he, knowing the
Laws ſo well, I hope, he ſhall ſuffer for trangreſſion thereof.</p>

                  <p>You do very well know, that this, that you did,
this horrid, deteſtable Act, which you Committed, could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be perfected by you; till you had broken the <hi>Parliament.</hi>
That <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Commons,</hi> which you ſay gave you Authority,
you know, what your ſelf made of it, when you pulled out
the <hi>Speaker.</hi> Therefore do not make the <hi>Parliament</hi> to be the
Author of your black Crimes. It was innocent of it. You
know your ſelf, what Eſteem you had of it, when you broke,
and tore it in ſunder, when you ſcattered, and made them
hide themſelves, to preſerve them from your Fury, and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.
Do not make the <hi>Parliament</hi> to be the Authour of your
Crimes. The <hi>Parliament</hi> are the three <hi>Eſtates.</hi> It muſt not be
admitted, that one <hi>Houſe,</hi> part of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> ſhould be

You know, that no <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> is binding; but what is

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56280:34"/>
whether we ſhould Judge it, or no. Yes, I tell you, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

have Power, after <hi>Laws</hi> are made, to go upon the <hi>Interpretation</hi>
of them. We are not to judge of thoſe things, that the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
do. But when the <hi>Parliament</hi> is <hi>purged</hi> (as you call it)
for the <hi>Commons</hi> alone to Act, for you to ſay, that this is the
<hi>Authority of Parliament,</hi> it is that, which every man will ſay,
<hi>Intrenches highly upon his Liberty, and Priviledge:</hi> And what

which is a new Treaſon. The greateſt Right, that ever the

is utterly untrue, I abhorred the doing of any thing touching the
<hi>Blackning</hi> of the King. There was a little Diſcourſe between the
King, and my ſelf. The King had told me, that He had heard,
that I ſhould come privately to the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> to offer ſome inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

whereas it is ſaid that my Carriage was hard to Him, when I

<hi>London:</hi> I was commanded, by the <hi>General,</hi> to fetch Him from

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Gentlemen of the Jury,</speaker>
                  <p>You ſee, that this <hi>Priſoner</hi> at the <hi>Bar</hi>
is Indicted for <hi>Compaſſing, Imagining,</hi> and <hi>Contriving</hi> the Death
of our late Sovereign Lord, King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, of Bleſſed
Memory. In this <hi>Indictment</hi> there are ſeveral things given, but
as Evidences of it: they are but the <hi>Overt-Acts</hi> of it. The one
is, firſt, that they did meet, and conſult together about the
putting the King to Death: and that alone, if nothing elſe
had been proved in the <hi>Caſe,</hi> was enough for you to find the
<hi>Indictment.</hi> For the <hi>Imagination</hi> alone is Treaſon by the Law.
But beauſe the <hi>Compaſſing</hi> and <hi>Imagining</hi> the Death of the
King is ſecret in the Heart, and no man knowes it but God
Almighty: I ſay, That the Imagination is Treaſon: yet it is
not ſuch, as the Law can lay hold of; unleſs it appear by ſome
<hi>Overt-Act.</hi> Then the firſt <hi>Overt-Act</hi> is their <hi>Meeting, Conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
and <hi>Propoſing</hi> to put the King to Death. The ſecond is
more open; namely, their <hi>Sitting</hi> together, and <hi>Aſſuming an
Authority</hi> to put the King to Death. The third is <hi>Sentencing</hi>
the King. And I muſt tell you, that any one of theſe Acts
prove the <hi>Indictment.</hi> If you find him guilty but of any one
of them; either <hi>Conſulting, Propoſing, Sitting,</hi> or <hi>Sentencing</hi>
(though there is full Proof for all) yet notwithſtanding you
ought to find the <hi>Indictment.</hi> You have heard what the <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi>
have ſaid, and the <hi>Priſoner</hi>'s own Confeſſion. Witneſſes
have ſworn their ſitting together; and that he was one: One
ſwears he ſate <hi>four</hi> times; another <hi>twice;</hi> ſome <hi>ſeveral times.</hi>
There are ſeveral Witneſſes for this: as Mr. <hi>Maſterſon,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Clark,</hi> Mr. <hi>Kirk,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Nutley.</hi> And then you have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
thing too, which truly the <hi>Priſoner</hi> did not ſpeak of. Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
was given againſt him, That he was the Perſon that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
the King: this was before that, which he would have
to be done by a <hi>Legiſlative Power:</hi> and that is another <hi>Overt-Act.</hi>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:56280:37"/>
If a man will go about to <hi>Impriſon</hi> the King; the <hi>Law</hi>
knows what is the ſad Effect of ſuch Impriſonment. That
hath often been adjudged to be an Evidence of <hi>Imagining,</hi> and
<hi>Compaſſing</hi> the Death of the King. That man, the <hi>Priſoner</hi> at
the <hi>Bar,</hi> it hath been proved to you, did <hi>Impriſon</hi> the King: and
it appears by his own Hand to the <hi>Warrant</hi> for ſummoning of
that Traiterous Aſſembly, <hi>The High Court of Juſtice,</hi> as they
called it. And alſo it appears by his Hand to the <hi>Warrant</hi> for
Execution; that <hi>Bloody Warrant.</hi> He hath been ſo far from
denying, that he hath Juſtified theſe Actions. The <hi>Evidence</hi>
is ſo clear, and pregnant, as nothing more. I think you need
not go out.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Jury</hi> went together at the <hi>Bar,</hi> and preſently unanimouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed

                  <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhips and you Gentlemen
of the Jury; this Priſoner at the Bar ſtands indicted ſor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing
and imagining the death of the late King of bleſſed
memory. The Indictment ſets out, that to that end and
purpoſe the Priſoner at the Bar did with others, aſſemble and
ſit together at <hi>Weſtminſter Hall</hi> conſulting upon him, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurped
an authority to proceed againſt the life of our ſaid late
Soveraign, and in perſuance of that, our late Soveraign was
brought to his death. Theſe things are alledged in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment
as ſeveral <hi>over Acts</hi> to ſhew the treaſon of his
heart, which was the compaſſing and imagining the death
of the King; Compaſſing and Imagining are the words of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56280:40"/>
the Statute, the reſt of the Indictment is but as ſo many overt-acts,
evidences and manifeſtations of that corrupt and wicked
heart of his, by which he firſt thought ſuch a thought againſt his
Soveraign. The manner of our evidence ſhall be this: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they could come to accompliſh this damnable deſign, it
was neceſſary to meet in a trayterous aſſembly, which they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>High-Court of Juſtice,</hi> that under the pageantry and
mockery of that, they might pretend to murder him by a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence;
and before that aſſembly could come to ſit, there was
a Precept ſet forth very formally to ſummon them to ſit.
This Priſoner at the Bar is one of thoſe perſons, who under his
hand and ſeal did ſummon that Court to ſit upon the life, of
our late Soveraign. When the Court in obedience to that
ſummons (as they called it) did meet, they ſate ſeveral times,
and he among them; they did proceed with a wonderful
impudence (as they had begun) to pronounce ſentence of
death upon our late Soveraign; My Lords, this Priſoner at the
Bar was amongſt them, and was at that Court, and gave the
ſentence. When they had done, that they might compleat
their villany, they made a bloody Warrant for ſevering the head
of his late Majeſty from his body, and the hand of the Priſoner
is to that Warrant alſo; and this is the ſcope of our Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, upon ſome occaſion I was acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally
at the Chamber of the Speaker, there I met this
Gentleman whom indeed I knew not; he told me who he
was; and when I underſtood who he was, I ſaid to him
(or words to this purpoſe, I cannot tell the words) becauſe
I would not diſtaſte him, and ſay <hi>you</hi> have done this, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I put it thus, <hi>We</hi> have done this, What a ſad caſe have
<hi>we</hi> ſaid I, brought this Kingdom unto? Why, ſaith he?
you ſee, ſaid I, how it is ruined, now the King is murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<hi>&amp;c,</hi> Saith he, <hi>ſome are of one opinion, and ſome of another.</hi>
Sir, ſaid I, do you think it was well done to murther the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56280:44"/>
King? ſaith he, I <hi>will not make you my Confeſſor, Sir,</hi> it was
much to this purpoſe.</p>

                  <speaker>Lord Elect.</speaker>
                  <p>Truly I do not know the day, but it was that
day that Sir <hi>H. M.</hi> rendered himſelf to the Speaker, it was
ſince the coming in of the King.</p>

                  <p>Neither time nor the hand of God appearing in
this buſineſs, nor the condition he was in, was ever able
to bring this Gentleman to be ſorry for his offence; but we
do not give it as any evidence of his crimes: You have
heard the Priſoner confeſs the two Warrants; You have
heard by ſeveral witneſſes produced, that he did ſit in that
which they called the High-Court of Juſtice, by three,
that he ſat particularly on that day they called the day of
their Judgment; you have heard how little penitence he
hath had, by his Declaration to the Lord Mayor Elect.</p>

                  <p>Truly my Lords, though my breeding hath not been in
the way of the Laws, and therefore I have a great diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
when there be ſuch learned Gentlemen as theſe are to plead
againſt me. I muſt confeſs to you, I have ſomething for matter
of Law to plead for the juſtification of the fact, though I would
not undertake to juſtifie the perſon, this I humbly entreat, if it
may be granted, that I may have ſome time given me and ſome
Councel, that I may anſwer matter of Law.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. Bar.</speaker>
                  <p>M. <hi>Scroop,</hi> if you have any thing of matter
of Law, for which you would have Councel, you muſt
alledge that matter firſt; the uſe of Councel is only to
put in certainty, what you have of matter of Law, and
then the Court and Judges muſt judge of it. If you have
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56280:45"/>
matter of Law, you muſt tell what it is; if it be matter
that there is cauſe to over-rule it, there is no cauſe of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
further uſe of Councel. If one be Indicted for mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
when he comes to Tryal, he will ſay, I have matter
of Law to plead; What is that? That Murther is no fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony:
Do you think Councel will be admitted in this? If
you do alledge what this matter is wherein you deſire
Councel, you ſhall have your anſwer.</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>My Lords, as well as I am able to do it I ſhall do
it; my Lord, I was not of the Parliament; take notice of
that, and that which was done in the High Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
it was done by a Commiſſion from the Parliament.
My Lord, it was that Authority which was then, I will
not ſay it was ſo, becauſe I would not give offence; it
was that Authority then which was accounted the ſupreme
Authority of the Nation; and that Authority, My Lord,
that a great many of the generality of the Nation ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to. My Lord, I having received a command from that
Authority, what I did was in obedience to that Authority:
My Lord, I have not had time to conſider of theſe things,
becauſe I have been for theſe ſix weeks time ſhut up a
cloſe Priſoner, and that I could neither come at Councel
nor any thing elſe, nor to get any thing to prepare for it;
therefore I deſire your Lordſhips to do me the ſavour, if
you ſee any weight in it, to let me have time and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
aſſigned me.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. Bar.</speaker>
                  <p>Have you done Sir.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Scr.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. Bar.</speaker>
                  <p>Then I take it, this is the effect of what you
have ſaid, if I have not taken it aright tell me ſo; You
ſay you juſtifie the fact though not your Perſon; That
you were not of the Parliament; That what was done
was by Commiſſion from the Parliament: Be pleaſed not
to miſtake me; for I ſay you ſaid this: That that which
I have to plead in juſtification of it, I do not ſay that I
juſtifie my ſelf, but that which I have to ſay is for juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Fact: I was firſt no contriver of the buſineſs;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56280:45"/>
And then ſecondly, I did it by virtue of the Command,
and in obedience to the Authority of the Parliament: That
that Authority was then accounted the Supream Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Nations, and that the Generality of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
did ſubmit to their Authority; I think I have repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
all you have ſaid. Then Mr. <hi>Scroop</hi> you muſt know
this, That there is no cauſe at all why Councel ſhould be
given for what you ſpeak; I profeſs it rather tends to the
aggravation than extenuation of what you did. Firſt, you
ſay you did it by Authority of Parliament, I am afraid
you have been miſtaken as well as others, by the word
Parliament, what doth that mean? I am ſure you and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>every
one knows that there was not one Precedent ever
heard of, till this, That the Houſe of Commons ſhould take
upon them the Legiſlative Power, and make ſuch an Act as
this was, there was no colour for it. Then for men upon
their own heads never heard of before, and againſt the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
and Fredome of the People, that they ſhould call it
the Parliament when there was but 46 ſate, whereas there
was above 240 excluded; and how you can call this a
Houſe of Commons is a great wonder to me; but I tell
you this take it for granted, that if they were the moſt
perfect Houſe of Commons that could be: Did ever the
Houſe of Commons before this ſingle Act, take upon them
the Legiſlative Powers without the Lords? The Acts are
begun in the Commons Houſe; when you have done, if
the Lords not paſs it, it is a bortive; if it be done by both
Houſes, there ought to be a Royal aſſent: But the Lords
had rejected this Act; then they muſt take upon them,
theſe 46 men, whereof I do believe there was not above
25 or 26 men that did vote this, and this muſt be called
the Parliament, the Commons of <hi>England.</hi> I would fain
know whether any man hath heard, that the Houſe of
Commons took upon them the Legiſlative power before this
Act? but this hath been over-ruled in the like Caſe, and I
ſhall ſay no more to it. What is the Oath of Allegiance?
is it not that you would defend the King, his Crown, Rights
and Liberties, againſt all perſons whatſoever? It was not
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56280:46"/>
only againſt the Pope, (as ſome would have it) but the word
is, <hi>or otherwiſe:</hi> They broke the oath of Supremacy: which
was, <hi>That the King was the Supreme Governour of theſe Nations:</hi>
They ſwore that they would maintain and keep all Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
Immunities, Preheminencies, annexed to the Imperial
Crown of this Realm; there is difference between ſome
Crowns, and Imperial Crowns; An Imperial Crown, it
was that which was not to be touched in the Perſon: We
do not ſpeak any thing of the abſoiute Power of the King;
for you ſee he cannot Judge concerning the Death of his
Father, but by <hi>Lawes.</hi> When you ſwore this Allegiance, all
thoſe Members of break all this at once, This would be ſo
far from having any colour of Authority, that he that juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
it, juſtifies it againſt the light of Conſcience and Laws.
You ſay you did it by Commandment from them; He that
doth a Command by ſuch an Authority, it is his guilt: Our
<hi>Law-Books</hi> ſay, That if a Court at Common-Law exceed
their Juriſdiction, in that Caſe, he that obeys that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
is puniſhable. In the Court of Common-Pleas, if
there be an Appeal there for Murther, it is only proper to
the Upper Bench; and therefore if the party be condemned,
ſentenced, and executed thereupon, the Executioner in that
Caſe is guilty of Murther, for obeying that Authority which
was indeed no Authority: And therefore whereas you would
go about to juſtifie the Fact, becauſe you did it by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of that Authority, that is an Aggravation, That
when men ſhall aſſume an Authority which is a Devil at the
noon-day, appearing without Vizors; I ſay, ſhall aſſume an
Authority never heard of before, If men will countenance
their Acts by obeying of them, it is an Aggravation: We
have already Declared this in the Caſe of the Priſoner yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day;
We are all ſatisfied in the <hi>Law</hi> in that Caſe: It is ſo
clear a Point in <hi>Law,</hi> that my Brethren here and we did
over-rule it yeſterday in the like Caſe, and ſo We muſt
now; and I hope that all do concur in this Opinion, that
hath been delivered.</p>

by my Lord Chief Baron: You ſhelter your ſelf under a
Command of the Houſe of Commons, But let me tell you

been a thing no ways juſtifiable; the Juſtification is an Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation.</p>

be for clearing of my ſelf from your ill opinion, I ſee it is taken
in an ill ſence (I humhly beſeech pardon for the Expreſſion) if I
erre I will crave your Lordſhips pardon; But my Lord, I ſay
this, If I have been miſled, I am not a ſingle perſon that have
been miſled. My Lord, I could ſay, (but I think it doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
me to ſay ſo) That I ſee a great many faces at this time
that were miſled as well as my ſelf; But that I will not inſiſt
upon: I ſay this, That I hope an Error in Judgment ſhall not be
accounted Malice, or an Error of the Will: Truly (my Lord)
I never went to the work with a malicious heart: I humbly deſire
your Lordſhips to take notice of it, That I never bore any malice at

that may be ſome kind of excuſe to God, but towards man
you are to look to the Fact, the Law implies the malice. If

                  <p>Truly my Lord, This I do perceive, that I am under
a very great prejudice as to this fact. It hath been the caſe of
many Gentlemen beſides my ſelf, I deſire that theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
would take my caſe into conſideration, as they would
their own, and I deſire that the Lord would give them dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
that they may do that which is according to Juſtice
and Mercy; that is all I have to ſay my Lords.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. Bar.</speaker>
                  <p>You Gentlemen that are ſworn of this Jury,
you ſee the Priſoner Mr. <hi>Scroop,</hi> hath been indicted for ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
and contriving the death of his late Majeſty of bleſſed
memory, King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt. You ſee there are ſeveral
things in this Indictment; the charge is the Imagining and
compaſſing the death of the King. In the Indictment there
are ſeveral matters of fact to prove this Imagination. The
Imagination is the Treaſon, the matters of fact to prove it
are but the evidences of that imagination; if any one of
them be proved to you it is ſufficient, the one is conſulting
and meeting together how to put him to death, the other
Sitting and Aſſuming Authority to bring him to Tryal.
Then you have a Sentence by the Court to put the King to
Death thereupon. Afterwards he was put to Death. Any
one of theſe matters are Evidence enough for you to prove
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56280:48"/>
the <hi>Indictment;</hi> for though the <hi>Indictment</hi> concludes that ſo
they did <hi>Imagine</hi> and <hi>Compaſs</hi> the Death of the King, and
that the King was put to Death in manner and form as
aforeſaid; the manner and form aforeſaid goes to this,
To the imagination of the Heart; for the: <hi>Law</hi> did not
think any one would put the King to death, they thought
it ſo a Crime, they thought it not convenient to
bring it into the Statute. But the <hi>Compaſſing</hi> and <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining</hi>
the Death of the King, is made Treaſon: Then
to apply it, this Fact, to the Gentlemen, it appears to
you here by the proofs againſt him. Here is Mr. <hi>Maſterſon,</hi>
he ſwears he ſaw him ſit in that pretended Court, there
was your Evidence of the firſt, the firſt was their <hi>Meeting
together;</hi> and of the ſecond too, They did <hi>Aſſume Authority</hi>
upon them; and he ſwears further to the <hi>Sentencing,</hi> That
the Priſoner was there. Here were the Three <hi>Overt-Acts</hi>
all proved. He confeſſes he did ſign the <hi>Warrant</hi> for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the King to Death: This without any Witneſs at all,
was a ſufficient proof, a Proof of proofs. The other Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
you hear what they ſay, you hear Mr. <hi>Kirk,</hi> M. <hi>Clark,</hi>
M. <hi>Nutley,</hi> ſwear all to his Sitting there. It is true, when
this comes to the particulars where he ſate, you muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
it was Twelve Years ago; when a man ſees a mixt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of about Eighty Perſons, it is impoſſible a man ſhould
be able to anſwer this particular after Twelve years, where
ſuch a one ſate: but you may ſee by his Sentencing what he
did. They all witneſs they ſaw him poſitively; and one
tells you, <hi>He wondered, he ſaw him there:</hi> and indeed it might
be a wonder; for Mr. <hi>Scroop</hi> (to give him his right) was
not a Perſon as ſome of the reſt; but he was unhappily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in that Bloody Buſineſs, I hope miſtakenly; but when
it comes to ſo high a Crime as this, men muſt not excuſe
themſelves by ignorance, or miſguided Conſcience. As to
God, for this <hi>Horrid Murther of the King,</hi> ſomewhat may
be; but there is no Excuſe or Extenuation before Man;
there may be, I ſay, before the Lord. You ſee the Proof is
full againſt this Gentleman, as full as may be, Witneſſes ſaw
him Sit, and he himſelf confeſſed he ſigned the <hi>Warrants.</hi> I
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56280:48"/>
have no more to ſay to you; but <hi>Gentlemen;</hi> you ſee what it
is, I think, for matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> you need not go from the
<hi>Bar;</hi> but I leave it to you.</p>

Hue and Cry ſtill proceeds againſt the Murtherers of our
late Sovereign Lord King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt of bleſſed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
and this Gentleman the priſoner at the Bar is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
as one among others, for ſhedding that pretious
blood. Gentlemen of the Jury, he ſtands indicted before
you, For that he (I cannot expreſs it better) not having
the fear of God before his eyes, but being ſeduced by the
inſtigation of the Devil, he did imagin and compaſs the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56280:49"/>
death of his ſaid late Majeſty. In proſecution of this, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
there be ſeveral things that are mentioned in the
Indictment, which are the open acts to diſcover to you
theſe ſecret and private imaginations. He did meet and
conſult with divers perſons touching the death of the King,
that did uſurp and take upon them to exerciſe a Power
and Juriſdiction to try the King; and finally, moſt horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
put him to death. The Treaſon by the Statute of 25
<hi>Edw.</hi> 3. and which you are to enquire of, is, the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and compaſſing the death of the King, the reſt of the
Indictment are but particulars to prove, that he did ſo ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
and compaſs the death of the King. If we ſhall prove
theſe or any of theſe facts, you have then ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict
them. There was a thing they called a High Court
of Juſtice, that was ſet up, wherein they did intend to try
our late Sovereign Lord, and a precept made, and that
under the hand and ſeal of the priſoner at the Bar, amongſt
others, for ſummoning and convening that bloody Court,
where (among the reſt of the Miſcreants) the priſoner at
the Bar did ſit and had confidence, nay impudence, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
Judgment againſt his Soveraign. In this he reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not, but he among them ſet his Hand and Seal to that
bloody Roll or Warrant for putting him to death, which
accordingly was done, and to theſe ſeveral open acts we
ſhall call out Witneſſes, and ſo proceed.</p>

                  <p>Then the thing that I ſtand upon before the Lord,

muſt all ſtand, and give an account of this action, which is
a very great and weighty one: And whereas it is charged
there, for I ſhall not trouble you with many words as to
the particulars, or as to the proofs; but I ſhall ingeniouſly
acknowledg what the truth is, and how far I can believe it:
and therefore I ſay as to the beginning of what was charg'd
by the Council, and according to the courſe of the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that what was done in thoſe things, that it was not
having the fear of God before mine eyes, but being moved
by the Devil, and that it was done with a Trayterous, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious,
and Deviliſh heart, and all thoſe things mentioned
in the Indictment: As for that I can ſay in the preſence of
the Lord, who is the ſearcher of all hearts, that what I
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56280:51"/>
did was in his fear; and I did it in obedience to his holy and
righteous Laws.</p>

                  <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
                  <p>It is part of my charge not to have the fear of God,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> I did ſuch and ſuch things. I hope I may have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>

                  <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſay that I did it in the fear of the Lord, and I will
begin with that, and confeſs ingeniouſly the truth of it.
When this came into queſtion, there was an Ordinance
brought in to try the King, where my name was not as one of
the Judges. There was another afterwards, an Act which
I ſhall mention upon what ground by and by, what that
was, and that Act was brought in and committed, and
names brought in, and my Name was not brought in, and
ſo afterwards my name was put in, and ſeeing it, I did
ſtrike it out: After the Committee was up I told them, I
did deſire to be excuſed in ſuch a buſineſs. I have told
you how, wherein, and the ground that I did it, which
I ſhall leave with the Lord, in whoſe hand, your and my
breath, and all our breaths are; and therefore when it was
ſo, I did becauſe of the weight of it, as being a very great
and ſpecial thing, and ſo I was very unwilling, becauſe of
there being enow, which I thought had more experience
every way for ſo great a concernment, as that was, to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
rather then I, yet being ſatisfied with that Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
that did it; This is to ſhew you how that I had the
fear of the Lord, and did weigh the things: After that,
when the Bill was brought into the houſe, my name was
put in there with ſeveral others, ſo I came to be in; and
what I did was upon theſe two Accounts: Firſt in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
(as I told you) to the Lord, which was the chief
thing: And in obedience to that which was then the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56280:52"/>
Authority of this Nation; and therefore I ſhall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
theſe grounds very briefly, becauſe indeed the things
that are controverted here at this time, they have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted
in the Face of the whole world in ſeveral Nations;
and the Lord hath given an anſwer upon ſolemn Appeals,
to theſe things; I ſhall therefore mention them very briefly,
becauſe they have been ſo publique. The <hi>Declarations</hi>
and <hi>Remonſtrances</hi> that have paſſed between the King and
Parliament concerning the beginning of the Wars—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Chief Baron.</speaker>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Ca.</hi> I would be very loth to interrupt
you; But I ſee what courſe is taken, and the peoples eyes are
upon you: You ſeek delays, and againſt the courſe of
Priſoners you ſay you will confeſs; but you do confeſs the
Fact after you have ſpent the time. And all the Witneſſes
are heard for this that you ſpeak of now; you go about to
juſtifie as in the fear of the Lord, or any thing of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that we cannot allow of; but we do allow you to
ſpeak and give the heads of what you will ſay as to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Fact; but to hear you make diſcourſes and debates
which are a juſtification of a horrid and notorious Treaſon, we
cannot hear it; we ought not to hear the maintaining of
open Treaſon; cannot hear you to ſpeak that upon your
opening, which is Treaſon: We are willing that you open
the Heads what you have to ſay; we are upon our conſciences,
and to appear before God for what we do, and ſo are you too;
but remember the Devil ſometimes appears in the habit of
an Angel of light. If you will couch your matter in a few
words, the Court affords you liberty, which is indeed beyond
the ſtrict Rules of Law.</p>

there was no ſuch Act of the Supreme Authority as you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend

what are the Heads I wil inſiſt upon; I ſhall declare the grounds
upon which the Parliament did proceed.</p>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Carew,</hi> If that be your ground, the

that there was ſome difference between the King and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
the two Houſes of Parliament, Lords and Commons,

Parliament, as appears by their own Declaration, <hi>The great

not to ſuffer you to go on in this: they ſay it tends not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to juſtifie your Act, but you caſt in Bones here to make
ſome difference. You talk of the Lords and Commons,
you have nothing to do with that buſineſs: your authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

Commons in the Houſe, and but 26 Voted it.</p>

We ſee as before, ſo ſtill it is your courſe to
blow the Trumpet of Sedition. Did you ever hear, or can
you produce inſtances of an Act of Parliament made by
the Houſe of Commons alone, though this was not the
Houſe of Commons, as you heard before?</p>

a little to repeat that to him which your Lordſhips
have been ſo often troubled with declaring; this is not the
firſt or ſecond time that in this publique Aſſembly it hath
been ſaid, That neither the Lords nor the Commons, joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
nor ſeverally, have any power at all to proceed upon
the Perſon of the King; That it is not in their power to
condemn any man in <hi>England,</hi> without the good pleaſure
of the King, much leſs the King himſelf; and that this is
the great Liberty of the people of <hi>England</hi> that it ſhould
be ſo; and it was the firſt breach and invaſion of our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
that that firſt Parliament made, and which you juſtifie
in the name of the Lord. In this caſe to throw us upon
Debates of the War, and to talk here of the cauſes and
reaſons of that quarrel which ended in ſuch a Tragedie.
For this perſon to come here with this confidence, and to
juſtifie it, but that he knows he cannot be in a worſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
one would wonder it ſhould fall from any man that
hath any regard of himſelf; it is all one to them that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,
whether they fall by one ſin or multitudes. He
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56280:54"/>
makes no ſcruple to multiply Treaſons; I do beſeech your
Lordſhip he may not offer as he hath begun, but that the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

                  <p>I think you were preſent in the Houſe of
Commons when that Vote paſſed for agreement with the
King in the Treaty at the <hi>Iſle of Wight.</hi> You know the
King having condeſcended to moſt of the deſires of This
Parliament; there was a debate in the Houſe, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
that they were grounds for peace. You know the
Lords and Commons did reſolve to agree with their King;
when that was done, that would not ſatisfie you and other
Members of the Houſe; Then you go and contrive new
ways; you contrive a new faſhioned Parliament, the
driving away many Members by power, which you could
not do by the Law of the Land; Nay, the Parliament had
Declared againſt that which you pretend is by Authority,
is no Authority, for a few of you ſet up an Arbitrary Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
of a few of your ſelves; when you had driven
away the reſt: This kind of Parliament gives you the
Authority you pretend to: You were ſaying that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
was called at firſt the Lords and Commons by the
King, according to the ancient Conſtitutions of the Laws;
Did ſuch a Parliament give you ſuch Authority as you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56280:55"/>
to, and Act of Parliament, as you call it, which was
but an Order of ſome of the Commons, and but a few
of them; you can have no manner of Juſtification, and
therefore your Plea muſt be over-ruled as yeſterday it was
in the like Caſe. You are indicted upon a cleer Act of
Parliament of 25. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. and you defend your ſelf upon

                  <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, You ſee the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
here at the Bar hath been Indicted of Treaſon, and
this was for Compaſſing and Imagining the Death of our
Soveraign Lord, K. <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, of bleſſed Memory.
The Indictment ſets forth ſeveral <hi>overt-Acts</hi> to prove this
Imagination, for otherwiſe it is ſecret in the heart; the
Fact it ſelf, the Treaſon it ſelf, is the Imagination of the
heart: The <hi>overt-Acts</hi> that are laid down in the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to prove this, <hi>That they did conſult and meet together
how to put the King to death, That they did ſit upon him,</hi> And
thirdly, <hi>That they did ſentence him to death, and afterwards
he died.</hi> You heard what is proved againſt the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
the Priſoner at the Bar, by ſeveral Witneſſes: His
own Confeſſion, That he ſigned the Warrant for Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning
and Convening that Court together, whereby
the King was to be brought to his Tryal; and that he ſate
at his Sentence, and iſſued the warrant for his Execution:
You ſaw that this Gentleman did the Fact, did Compaſs
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56280:56"/>
and Imagine the King's Death. That which you are to
try is this Iſſue, being Indicted for <hi>High Treaſon,</hi> and plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>not Guilty;</hi> whether this Gentleman that went ſo far,
Sate upon him, Condemned him, Signed the Warrant
for his Execution, did not <hi>Compaſs</hi> and <hi>Imagin</hi> the King's
Death? I think you need not ſtir from the Bar where you
are; but I leave that to you.</p>

at the Bar, he ſtands Indicted for Compaſſing, Imagining,

It is laid to his Charge in the Indictment, That he did
aſſemble at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and that he with other perſons uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
an Authority of ſitting and ſentencing to death his ſaid
late Majeſty, and that in conſequence and purſuance of that
the King came to his death: The Treaſon he ſtands charged
with is the Compaſſing and Imagining the Kings death;
The other parts of the Indictment are but overt acts, that
do but evidence and prove the Corruption of his heart: if
we prove but ſome of theſe overt acts, then you muſt find him
guilty. Our Evidence againſt this Gentleman will be thus:
We ſhall call Witneſſes to prove his ſitting in the Court,
ſentencing his King, while his King ſtood a Priſoner at the
Bar; the Warrant for Execution of the King directed to
certain perſons to ſee Execution done accordingly, was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Hands and Seals; and among thoſe Hands and Seals,
the Hand and Seal of the Priſoner at the Bar is one: and then
we ſhall produce to your Lordſhips Witneſſes to ſhew you
with what a hard and impenitent heart this hath been Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted;
for he ſo gloried in the Act, That he deſired it
might be writ upon his Tomb—</p>

preſent in the year 1648. when his late Majeſty ſtood a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
at the Bar in that which they called the <hi>High Court of
Juſtice;</hi> and among other perſons there preſent in that buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
I obſerved Mr. <hi>Scot,</hi> the Priſoner at the Bar, to ſit as
one of the Judges, and particularly upon the 23 and 27th
days of <hi>Jan.</hi> in the ſaid year, upon which laſt day the Court
pronounced Judgement upon the late King.</p>

that doth not extend to your Caſe, you are not charged here

                  <speaker>Scot.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſay this, Whatever I did, be it more or leſs, I did it by
he Command and Authority of a Parliamentary Power, I did ſit as
one of the Judges of the King, and that doth juſtifie me whatever
the nature of the fact was.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lo. Ch. Bar.</speaker>
                  <p>We have had theſe things alledged before us
again and again: The Court are clearly ſatisfied in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
that this act could not be done by any Parliamentary
power whatſoever. I muſt tell you what hath been delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that there is no power on earth that hath any coercive
power over the King, neither ſingle Perſons nor a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
neither the people Collectively nor Repreſentatively.
In the next place, that which you offer to be done as by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of Parliament, it was done by a few members of the
Houſe of Commons, there were but 46 there at that time,
and of theſe 46 not above 26 that voted it, at that time the
Houſe of Lords was ſitting, who had rejected it, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them there was no Parliament, there was a force upon
the Parliament, there was excluded ſeven parts of eight:
Suppoſing you were a full Houſe of Commons, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
exception, there was not Authority enough, and it is
known to you (no man better) that there never was a Houſe
of Commons before this time, that this foul Act was made
for erecting that High Court of Juſtice (as you call'd it) aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
that Authority of making a Law, you cannot pretend
to act by Authority of Parliament; and becauſe you would
excuſe it, you did it by Authority of Parliament, whether it
were good or no; If a man do that which is unlawful by an
unlawful Authority; the aſſuming to do it by that Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
is an Aggravation, not an Extenuation of the Fact. It
was over-ruled, I think my Lords will tell you, That they
do not allow of that Authority at all, either to be for Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
or Plea.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Scot.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lords I humbly pray leave to ſay, that without
offence to the Court (every perſon whereof I honour) This
Court hath not Cognizance to Declare whether it were a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or no.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Lo. Ch. Bar.</speaker>
                  <p>That was objected too, and we muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
you, That firſt of all it is no Derogation to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
That what is a Statute or not a Statute, ſhould be
adjudged by the Common Laws. We have often brought
it into queſtion, whether ſuch and ſuch a thing was an Act
of Parliament or not, any man may pretend to an
Authority of Parliament: If forty men ſhould meet at <hi>Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Hill,</hi> as the <hi>Little Convention</hi> did at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and ſay,
<hi>We do declare our ſelves a Parliament of England:</hi> becauſe they
do ſo, ſhall not this be judged what is a Statute and what
not? It is every days practiſe, we do judge upon it; the Fact
is ſo known to every body, they did aſſume to themſelves a
<hi>Royal Authority;</hi> it hath been over-ruled already, it hath
been the miſtake of many, the vulgar acceptation of the
word Parliament. A Parliament conſiſts of the King, Lords
and Commons; it is not the Houſe of Commons alone; and
ſo it is not by Authority of Parliament: It is not unleſs
it be by that Authority which makes up the Parliament:
You cannot give one inſtance, That ever the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
did aſſume the Kings Authority.</p>

Mr. <hi>Scot,</hi> for this we muſt over-rule it, as we have done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
there is nothing at all to be pleaded to the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:56280:61"/>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Scot,</hi> what you ſpeak concerning the Lords
Spiritual is nothing to your Caſe, be it either one way of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
it was done by an Act of Parliament, with conſent of
the King, Lords and Commons, though you will bring it down
to make theſe Commons have a legiſlative Power, I told you
it was over-ruled before. We have ſuffered you to expati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
into that which was a thing not intended by many of my
Lords, that you ſhould have any ſuch power to expatiate
into that which is nothing but indeed to make a new Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
which is the higheſt Treaſon next to the Murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the King in the world; To ſubvert the Laws, and to
make a few of the Commons, nay, if they had been the whole,
to make them to have the Legiſlative power. Mr. <hi>Scot,</hi> if
you have any thing in extenuation of the Fact we ſhall hear
you, further we cannot.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Finch.</speaker>
                  <p>If you ſpeak to this purpoſe again, for my part
I will profeſs my ſelf, I dare not hear further of it; It is ſo
poyſonous blaſphemous a doctrine contrary to the Laws, if
you go upon this point I ſhall (and I hope my Lords will be
of that opinion too) deſire the Jury may be directed.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Scot.</speaker>
                  <p>I thought my Lord you would rather be my Councel, it is
not my ſingle opinion, I am not alone in this Caſe, therefore I think
I may juſtifie my ſelf in it, it was the Judgement of many of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
Members to own us to be a Parliament.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lord Anneſley.</speaker>
                  <p>What you ſaid laſt doth occaſion my ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
you ſeem to deliver my opinion, who you know could
never agree to what you have alledged; truly I have been
heartily ſorry to hear the defence you have made to day,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56280:61"/>
becauſe you know I have had Letters from you of another
nature; I was very confident to have heard you an humble
Penitent this day inſtead of juſtifying your ſelf: As to that
which you ſay of the Secluded Members owning you to be a
Parliament; they were ſo far from it, that you know for
how many years they lay under ſufferings and obſcurity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they could not acknowledge that an Authority which
was not ſo: You cannot forget the Declaration of both
Houſes that was publiſhed upon a Jealouſie that the people
had, they would change the Government of King, Lords and
Commons; It was far from their thoughts, it was called in that
Declaration <hi>A black ſcandal caſt upon them:</hi> This Declaration
you know was by Order of both Houſes affixed in all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of <hi>England</hi> that people might take notice what they
held to be the Fundamental Government of this Kingdom,
<hi>King, Lords and Commons:</hi> After this for you to ſet up ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Government, and under them to act ſuch things that
one would think ſhould hardly enter into the heart of any
man. You know very well all along they declared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
faithful Subjects to the King, and ſo would have lived
and dyed; and you might have had your ſhare of the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of that peace, if you could have had an Inclination to
ſubmit to that which both Houſes had reſolved, when you
and others could not bring your hearts to ſtoop to your Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Subjects, when you could not ſubmit to that equal rule
to take your ſhare with them. When Pride carried ſome
ſo high, then was the beginning of your fall and others, and
none could expect other than what is now come to paſs,
That they ſhould come to that ſhame and ſorrow that this
day hath brought upon you: I could have wiſhed to have
heard nothing but an humble confeſſion of the fault that
hath been clearly proved, and no Juſtification of it: You
have ſworn among others to preſerve the Laws and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the Kingdom; but you drove away not only the
Houſe of Lords, but moſt of the Commons, and then to give
the name of a Parliament to the Remainder, this is a
great, aggravation of your Treaſon. I think we of the
Secluded Members could not have diſcharged our duty to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:56280:62"/>
God and the Kingdom, if we had not then appeared in
Parliament to have diſſolved that Parliament, and ſo by our
joynt aſſent put an end to all your pretences, which if we
had not done, we had not ſo ſoon come to our happineſs, nor
you to your miſeries.</p>

                  <p>The Court hath told you before their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the thing, and no further debate is to be allowed in
this, the Juſtification of it doth comprehend treaſon; We our

We do, We do upon our Oaths, and muſt anſwer it before
God Almighty. The Court hath delivered their opinions
before, that in this Caſe the Pretended Authority under
which you did derive that Power which you did execute, that
it is no Authority, it is void in Law, it is a foundation (if it
were true) of ſubverting all Laws, and indeed of all Religion,
a Power that you aſſumed to your ſelves of Judging and
Condemning your King, that you would countenance ſuch an
Authority is a great aggravation of the fault. They are
Jugdes whether you did Imagine or Compaſs the Kings
Death, that is all the Jurors have to do. Gentlemen of the

Priſoner <hi>Tho. Scot,</hi> ſtands Indicted for Compaſſing and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
the death of our Dread Soveraign King <hi>Charles</hi> the
Firſt of moſt glorious and bleſſed memory; He is Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
for Compaſſing and Imagining his death, there is the
Treaſon; and what is ſet afterwards in this Indictment is
only to manifeſt this Compaſſing and Imagining, becauſe that
being in the heart alone without ſome overt Act no body
can prove it: There are ſeveral overt Acts laid in the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:56280:63"/>
Indictment; one is, A Trayterous conſulting and meeting
together how to put the King to death: Then a ſitting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the King as a Priſoner, being before them, about his life
and death; The third is Sentencing to death: that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
is, That he was Murthered: If any of theſe acts
ſhould be proved, the Indictment is proved; for the proof,
there are ſeveral Witneſſes have fully proved that he did ſit
there ſeveral times, particularly upon <hi>Jan.</hi> 27. which was
the day of the Sentence: That he did ſit there, all of them
agree to that; It is true as to the Circumſtance where he
ſate; one Gentleman ſaith he ſate in the ſecond Row, on
the left hand of <hi>Bradſhaw;</hi> you well remember it is 12. years
ago, how any man upon the view, and after ſo long a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of time ſhould he able to remember in what poſture
one man was from the reſt, I think neither you nor I can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member:
Here is one proved: to you that he did ſign that
Warrant for Executing the King; he ſaith, <hi>How can another
know his Hand?</hi> You ſee what the Witneſſes ſay, they knew
it; a man can prove nothing more of another mans Hand
than that, unleſs they ſee it written, there is nothing to put
upon you but his words. You ſee what words are aggravated
againſt Mr. <hi>Scot;</hi> Whereas he ſaith, It is a breach of the
Priviledges of Parliament; if it were ſo, it is nothing to
this Fact; though another man ſhould break the priviledges
of Parliament it is nothing to you; but beſides it is not a
breach of the priviledge of Parliament. You have heard
the Witneſſes what they have ſaid againſt him. Mr. Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thall,
ſwears that he did ſpeak at large fully in owning that
buſineſs of the Kings death; The reſt ſwear poſitively to the
ſame effect, and that at ſeveral times; What was that? He
gloried in it, defended it, and ſaid, <hi>He could wiſh it were En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven
on his Tomb ſtone;</hi> he hath denyed this that the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
have proved: That which is leſt to you is, whether
upon all this matter that you have heard, Whether the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
at the Bar is Guilty of Compaſſing and Imagining the
Kings death; and ſo go together—After a little Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation
together, they ſetled in their places again.</p>

                  <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, here is this Priſoner
<hi>John Jones</hi> ſtands Indicted, for that he with others did Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
and Imagine the Kings death, that is the ſubſtance of the
Indictment; The Indictment ſets forth ſeveral Acts, each
proving the Compaſſing and Imagining the Kings death: One
of them is, that he did conſult and meet together, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
how the King ſhould be put to death: The ſecond is,
they did aſſume a power to Judge the King The third
is, that they did actually ſit upon him; And the laſt of them
is, that they ſentenced the King, and afterwards the King
was murthered. The whole ſubſtance is, whether he did Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56280:65"/>
and Imagine the Kings death. If any one of theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
that are alledged for the overt acts be proved, you are
to find the Indictment. He hath confeſſed very Ingenuouſly,
that he did ſit upon the King, that he did ſit in that Court,
and ſo there is an overt act proved, if nothing elſe you ought
to find him guilty of this Treaſon. There is further Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
(though not any Evidence of his ſitting the laſt day of
the Sentence) you have had three comparing ſimilitudes of
hands to prove that he did ſign that Sentence, that horrid
Inſtrument whereby the King was ordered to be put to death,
one of them having received Letters from <hi>Ireland,</hi> and others
acquainted with his hand, ſay that it is like his hand; he hath
ſo confeſſed the likeneſs of his hand, but he ſaith he doth
not remember he ſigned it. As to you of the Jury there is no
more to be conſidered, if any one of the acts do appear true
to you, that is ſufficient to find him guilty, (though he were
not guilty of all) but that he did Compaſs and Imagine the
Kings death is clear, in ſitting, and ſigning the Warrant;
for the other, whether you ſhall find that he did ſentence the
King, that muſt be left to you. Whatſoever it is ſtill it is the
ſame, if any one be proved, you ought to find him guilty of
the Indictment, which is the Compaſſing and Imagining the
Kings death. I think you need not ſtir, from the Bar; for he
hath confeſſed it.</p>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Scot</hi> I muſt ſpeak a word to you; you
made mention of the Kings Proclamation for pardon, and
you did deſire the benefit of it. As I told you before, ſo now
again, That it was not proper for us upon that Proclamation
to give any allowance by way of Plea, becauſe the Pardon
ought to be under the Broad Seal, but God forbid but juſt
and due Conſideration ſhould be had of it with honour, ſo
far as you are comprehended within it: Though Judgment
ſhall paſs, no Warrant for Execution ſhall go out againſt you,
till conſideration be had how far you are within the Compaſs
of that Proclamation; and the like to you Mr. <hi>Scroop.</hi>

                  <speaker>Lo. Ch. Bar.</speaker>
                  <p>You that are Priſoners at the Bar: Ye ſee
the Sentence of death is now to paſs againſt you; and for
ought you know, or we know yet, may be nearer than you
are aware: How ſoon it will be executed we know not;
when you have reflected upon your own conſciences, many
of you could not chuſe but look there and ſee as in a glaſs;
the foulneſs of this horrid Offence: It is the <hi>Murther of our moſt
gracious Soveraign King</hi> Charles <hi>the Firſt of bleſſed memory;</hi> a
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56280:66"/>
Prince whom we (ſuch of us as had the honour perſonally
to attend him) knew, was of ſuch parts and vertues, if he
had been a private man more could not have been deſired;
truly what he did as a King, his Clemency; how it appeared
at firſt in this Princes time: If you look what Peace and
Proſperity we enjoyned in his days, we will not find it in
other Kings times; You had not a Noble-man put to death
ſave one, and that for an Offence which muſt not be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:
A Prince that had granted ſo much: You may
remember what was granted before the beginning of
theſe Wars: Grievances complained of, Star-Chamber,
High Commiſſion Court; Ship money; The <hi>Claim</hi> of Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> All theſe were taken away: What Conceſſions
he made after in the <hi>Iſle of Wight;</hi> how much he wooed and
courted the people for Peace. I urge this unto you only that
you would lay it to your hearts, that you would conſider
what it is to <hi>Kill a King,</hi> and to kill ſuch a King. If any of
you ſhall ſay, That we had no hand in the actual Murther of
the King, remember that they that brought him to the Bar,
were all one as if they had brought him to the Block, as St.
<hi>Paul</hi> confeſſed, though he held but the Clothes, he killed
the Martyr <hi>Stephen.</hi> You are ſhortly to appear before Gods
Tribunal, and I beſeech God Almighty that he will give
you, and us all, thoſe hearts, that we may look into our
ſelves; No fig-leaves will ſerve the turn; whatſoever
you have ſaid now as Priſoners, or allowed to ſay for your
own preſervation in point of Fact, <hi>Notwithſtanding</hi> it
will not ſerve before God Almighty: All things are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
before him. Lay it to your hearts: God Almighty
though you have committed theſe foul and horrid ſins, yet
he can pardon you, as he pardoned that murther of <hi>David:</hi> I
ſpeak it to you, that you may lay it to your hearts; I am
heartily ſorry in reſpect you are Perſons of great Civility<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and (thoſe that I know) of very good parts; and this I
muſt ſay, That you will conſider with your ſelves, if any of
you have been led away, though it were with his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience;
if any of you did it as you conceived in conſcience,
remember that our Saviour ſaith, <hi>The time ſhall come when
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56280:66"/>
they will perſecute you and kill you, and think they do God good
ſervice.</hi> I have the Judgment of Charity, poſſibly ſome of
you did it in this kind, and this is leſs than doing it wilfully;
others might do it by a miſ guided Conſcience; there is a
ſpiritual pride, men may over-run themſelves by their own
holineſs, and they may go by pretended Revelations: Men may
ſay I have prayed about ſuch a thing, I do not ſpeak it with
reproach to any; If a man that ſhould commit a Robbery
or Murther, meerly becauſe he will, and ſhould come and
ſay, I have prayed againſt it, and cannot underſtand it to be
a ſin, as one in <hi>Shropſhire</hi> did, and yet notwithſtanding
killed his own Father and Mother; try your own ſpirits, you
muſt not think that every Fancy and Imagaination is conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
Men may have a ſtrange fancy and preſumption, and
that they may call conſcience: Take heed, there is a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
pride; the Devil doth many times appear like an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
of light, do not reſt upon that ſelf-confidence: Examine
your hearts, conſider the Fact by the word of God; That is
the rule, the Law is to be applyed to it; <hi>Eccleſ. 8. Where
the word of a King is, there is power; and who can ſay unto him,
What doſt thou?</hi> that is to ſhew the power of Kings in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
Remember withal that of <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51. that peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential
<hi>Pſalm,</hi> when he had committed that horrid ſin againſt
<hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah;</hi> Remember what he ſaid being a K. <hi>Tibi ſoli peccavi,
Againſt thee only have I ſinned;</hi> Truly it being in ſuch a Caſe,
I ſpeak it as before God almighty, according to my duty
and conſcience; I wiſh moſt heartily as to your Perſons: I
pray God to give you that grace, that you may ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
it, and lay it to heart, and to have mercy upon you, and
to forgive you; And this is all that I have to ſay; and now
not I, but the Sentence of the Law, the Judgment which I
have to give againſt you is this, <hi>You Priſoners at the Bar, the
Judgement of the Court is, and the Court doth award, that you
be led back,</hi> &amp;c. And the Lord have mercy on your Souls.</p>

that are ſworn of this Jury, the Priſoner at the Bar ſtands
Indicted for High Treaſon for Compaſſing and Imagining

ſets forth, That he, together with others, did aſſemble at
<hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Hall, and ſets forth many other particulars of ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
ſentencing, and of the conſequent Death and Murther
of the King. The matter and charge of the Indictment is
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:56280:67"/>
for Compaſſing and Imagining the Death of the King,
the reſt of the Circumſtances of the Indictment are but
alledged as overt acts to prove the Imagination, which only
is the Treaſon. This Priſoner at the Bar ſtands here Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for this Treaſon of Compaſſing and imagining the late
Kings Death. My Lord, his part and portion in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
will be different from thoſe that have been tryed before
you, they ſat as Judges to ſentence the King, and he, my
Lord, ſtood as a wicked Inſtrument of that matter at the Bar,
and there he doth with his own hand ſubſcribe and exhibite a
charge of High Treaſon, a ſcandalous Libel againſt our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
to that pretended Court to be read againſt him
as an accuſaſion in the name of all the people of <hi>England;</hi>
when he had done that, he makes large diſcourſes and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations
to prove (if it had been poſſible) innocency it
ſelf to be Treaſon: When he had done, he would not ſuffer
his Majeſty to ſpeak in his defence, but ſtill took him up, and
ſaid, that he did ſpin out delays, and deſired that the charge
might be taken as if he had confeſſed it: He preſſed the
Court that Judgment might be given againſt the King; he
was the man that did demand that wicked Judgment before
the Court pronounced it; and he was the man that did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his own Conſcience, after he had acknowledged that
he was a wiſe and gracious King, yet ſays he, <hi>That he muſt
dye and Monarchy with him,</hi> there in truth was the Treaſon
and the cauſe of that fatal blow that fell upon the King.
This was his part to carry on; how he did it as a wicked
Counſellor we ſhall prove to you, and the wages and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of the Iniquity that he did receive.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, the firſt day of bringing his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
to his Tryal, was <hi>Saturday, Jan. 20.</hi> 1648. Before
they ſate in publick, they that were of the Committee of
that which they called the <hi>High Court of Juſtice,</hi> did meet in
the Painted Chamber, which was in the forenoon of that
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56280:68"/>
day. Being there I did obſerve that there was one <hi>Price</hi> a
Scrivener that was writing of a Charge; I ſtood at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
and ſaw him write, and I ſaw this Gentleman the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
at the Bar near thereabouts where it was writing, I think it
was at the Court of Wards. This charge afterwards (a Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
writing) I did ſee in the hands of this Gentleman the
Priſoner at the Bar. A very little after that they called
their names they did adjourn from the Painted Chamber into
<hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Hall, the great Hall. The Method that they
obſerved, the firſt thing was to call the Commiſſioners by
name in the Act; the pretended Act for trying the King
was read; that is, when the Court was ſat, the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
were called by their names, and as I remember they
ſtood up as their names were called: The next thing was
reading the Act for the trying of his late Majeſty. After
that was read, then this Gentleman, the Priſoner at the Bar
preſented the Parchment Writing, which was called the
<hi>Impeachment</hi> or Charge againſt his <hi>Majeſty:</hi> Mr. <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> was
then Preſident of that Court, and ſo called Lord Preſident;
he commanded that the Priſoner ſhould be ſent for, ſaying,
<hi>Serjeant</hi> Dendy <hi>ſend for your Priſoner;</hi> thereupon the King
was brought up as a Priſoner, and put within a Bar: And
when the Court was ſilenced and ſettled, this Gentleman the
Priſoner at the Bar did deliver the Charge, the Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the Court, and it was read: The King was demanded
to plead to it preſently. Here I ſhould firſt tell you,
that upon the Kings firſt coming in there was a kind of a
Speech made by Mr. <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> to the King in this manner,
I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

taking notice of the effuſion of blood in the Land, which is fixed
on you as the Author of it, and whereof you are guilty, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to bring you to a tryal and Judgment, and for this cauſe
this Tribunal is erected:</hi> There was little reverence given
to his Majeſty then, which I was troubled at: he add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this further, <hi>That there was a charge to be exhibited
againſt him by the Solicitor General;</hi> I think this <hi>Gentleman</hi>
was ſo called at that time, and he called to him to exhibit
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:56280:68"/>
the Charge; and this <hi>Gentleman,</hi> (the Priſoner at the Bar)
did deliver an Impeachment, a Parchment writing, which

                  <p>My Lords I do believe that this is the very
Charge, I am confident it is the ſame writing; I have often ſeen
him write, and by the Character of his hand this is the ſame.</p>

                  <p>My Lords immediately upon the delivery of this
Charge of Impeachment which was delivered in the Kings
preſence, after it was read the King was demanded to give an
anſwer to it, His Majeſty deſired to ſpeak ſomething before he
did anſwer to the pretended Impeachment (for ſo his Majeſty
was pleaſed to call it) He did uſe words to this purpoſe, ſaith
he, I do wonder for what cauſe you do convene me here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you: he looked about him, ſaith he, I ſee no Lords
here, where are the Lords? upon this Mr. <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for ſo he was called, did interrupt his Majeſty, and told
him, <hi>Sir,</hi> ſaith he, you muſt attend the buſineſs of the Court;
to that purpoſe you are brought hither, and you muſt give a
poſitive anſwer to the Charge: ſaith the King, you will hear
me to ſpeak, I have ſomething to ſay before I anſwer: after
much ado, he was permitted to go on in the diſcourſe he was
in, ſo far as they pleaſed. His Majeſty ſaid, I was in, the Iſle
of <hi>Wight,</hi> and there I was treated with by divers honourable
perſons, Lords and Commons, a treaty of peace between
me and my people, the treaty was ſo far proceeded in that
it was near a perfection: truly (ſaith he) I muſt needs ſay,
they treated with me honourably, and uprightly; and when
the buſineſs was come almoſt to an end, then (ſaith he) was I
hurried away from them hither, I know not by what Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
now I deſire to know by what Authority I was called to
this place: that is the firſt queſtion I ſhall ask you before I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
the charge. It was told him by Mr. <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
that the Authority that called him hither was a lawful
Authority: he asked him what Authority it was, the ſecond
time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it was anſwered him by the Preſident, that it was the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56280:69"/>
Authority of the Commons of <hi>England</hi> aſſembled in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which he affirmed then to be the Supream Authority of
this Nation: the King ſaid, I do not acknowledge its Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
Authority if taken in the beſt ſenſe, it muſt be of neceſſity
underſtood to be lawful; therefore I cannot aſſent to that: I
am under a Power, but not under an Authority: and there are
many unlawful Powers: a Power that is on the high way, I
think I am under a Power, but not under an Authority, you
cannot judge me by the Laws of the land, nor the meaneſt Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
I wonder you will take the boldneſs to impeach me your
lawful King. To this purpoſe his Majeſty was pleaſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
himſelf at that time, with more words to that purpoſe.
The King went on to further diſcourſe concerning the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of the Court. <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> the Preſident was pleaſed to
interrupt him, and told him ſeveral times, that he trifled out
the Courts time, and they ought not to indure to have their
Juriſdiction ſo much as queſtioned.</p>

the Kings anſwer ſeveral times: a poſitive anſwer was

interrupted him again and again, ſeveral times; and at length
it was pray'd that the charge that was exhibited againſt him
might be taken <hi>pro confeſſo.</hi>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Nutly,</hi> pray, what diſcourſe have you had at

                  <speaker>Nutly.</speaker>
                  <p>Truly my Lord, I knew the Gentleman well, I was
well acquainted with him, and for the ſatisfaction of my own
conſcience (for I was very tender in the buſineſs, and ſorry
he was ingaged in it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) I went to him and did deſire him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt;
I had diſcourſe with him (for I was then a young Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
in the Temple, and had a little knowledge in the
Laws:) I deſired him to conſider the dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:56280:69"/>
of ſuch a proceeding; I may ſay I did it with tears in
my eyes, for I had a very good reſpect to the Gentleman for
his profeſſion ſake, being learned therein: truly my Lord he
did anſwer me thus, <hi>I acknowlegde it is a very baſe buſineſs, but
they put it upon me, I cannot avoid it, you ſee they put it upon me.</hi> I
had ſome diſcourſe with him concerning the oath of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance:
truly he was ſatiſfied that this oath was againſt the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
in queſtion; I ſaw he was troubled at it.</p>

                  <speaker>Nutly.</speaker>
                  <p>That (I have already anſwered to it) was ſeveral
times done; the King was brought ſeveral times to the Bar,
and at every time he was brought, he was preſſed to anſwer
whether Guilty, or Not guilty.</p>

                  <p>By the Sollicitor, then, the Priſoner now at the Bar.
My Lord, I remember his Majeſty was pleaſed, when he ſaw he
could not be heard to the diſcourſe that he did intend to make
of the whole buſineſs; ſaith the King, if you will needs preſs
me to an anſwer, I muſt demur to your Juriſdiction: my Lord,
the anſwer that was given to that was this, Mr. <hi>Bradſhaw</hi>
there then Preſident did ſay, Sir, ſaith he, if you demur to
the Juriſdiction of this Court, I muſt let you know that the
Court doth over-rule your demurrer; this was ſaid my Lord,
and Judgement was preſſed very often.</p>

                  <p>The firſt queſtion is, whether the Parchment was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered

                  <p>I do encline to believe (my Lord) That it was
brought into the Court, and delivered by ſome hand or
other, to the Priſoner at the Bar, I do beleive it was, for I do
remember it was written by one <hi>Price;</hi> I was told that was
his name: that may be true, I believe it was brought into
the Court and delivered to the Priſoner now at the Bar.</p>

                  <p>Another Queſtion, whether Mr. <hi>Nutly</hi> did hear me ſay

                  <p>My Lords I do remember that I had often conference
with the Gentleman at the Bar.</p>
                  <p>I deſired him to deſiſt from the buſineſs, conſidering the
dangerous conſequences of it: truly my Lord, I do well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that he did ſay he did hope they did not intend to
take away the Kings life: ſaid I, if they go about any ſuch
thing, do you uſe your utmoſt endeavour to preſerve his life:
ſaith he, I did labour to that purpoſe, but they tell me, they
only intend to bring him to ſubmit to the Parliament.</p>

                  <p>That I have ſaid my Lord, it was urged by the Priſoner
at the Bar againſt his Majeſty, That if he would not plead to
the Charge, that then the matter charged in it might be taken
<hi>pro confeſſo.</hi> But my Lord, if you pleaſe to give me leave to
add this one word more, my Lord, I did hear him ſay at that
time; he ſhewed me a paper that contained an order of the
Court that did direct the very words that he ſhould uſe when
he came to deliver the Charge, whether thoſe words were in
the order I do not know.</p>

his Majeſty (the priſoner they called him) to the Bar; the
King being brought, after ſilence made, and ſome ſpeeches
made by the Preſident, this Gentleman the Priſoner at the
Bar, having then a Parchment in his hand, the ſubſtance of it
was for levying War againſt the Kingdom, he prayed that
it might be read and accepted as a Charge in behalf of the
good people of <hi>England.</hi> It was accordingly read, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
being demanded to anſwer, after his Majeſty having
given ſeveral reaſons as to the Juriſdiction of the Court, four
days, every day the Priſoner at the Bar demanded the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

                  <p>My Lord, I was all the time that the King was
brought there before the Court, as a Priſoner, I was preſent
all the day, having a conveniency out of my houſe into a
Gallery, that was ſome part of it over that Court. I do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that the Priſoner at the Bar (whom I never ſaw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that time) did exhibit a charge the firſt day againſt the
Priſoner at the Bar, which was the King, in theſe very terms,
<hi>The Priſoner at the Bar:</hi> the charge I heard it read, then; I
have not ſeen it ſince; the ſubſtance was this. That for levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
war againſt the Parliament and people of <hi>England,</hi> and
namely at ſuch and ſuch a place killing of the people of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
(I think <hi>Naſeby</hi> and <hi>Keinton</hi> field was named in it, and
divers other places were named in the Charge,) and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
was that he had done thoſe things as a Tyrant, Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
Murtherer, and a publick and implacable enemy of the
<hi>Commonwealth.</hi> But this Priſoner at the Bar did exhibit the
Charge, and the King did then, as you have heard he did,
plead to the Juriſdiction of the Court. The King would fain
have been heard, but I think they did adjourn for that time.
The next day he pleaded the ſame thing, I remember the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
that was ſeveral times given; twice given by <hi>Bradſhaw</hi>
to the King: thus, <hi>that the Court did aſſert their own Juriſdiction,</hi>
The ſecond and third day, I do not remember any day after
the firſt, but that the priſoner at the Bar did demand judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the Kings not pleading, and did ſeveral times make
complaints to the Court of the Kings delays, that he intended
delays and nothing elſe.</p>

                  <p>Upon Saturday the 20th of <hi>Jan.</hi> 1648. it was
the firſt day His Majeſty was convened before them.</p>
                  <p>I could not come near the Court; only I ſaw him at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
I heard nothing, but the acclamations of the people
crying out, <hi>God ſave your Majeſty:</hi> what was done in the Court
I know nothing of. On Munday I was there, and had a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency
to ſee and hear what was acted; and ſo His Majeſty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come to the Seat appointed for him, the priſoner at the
Bar being called upon by the then Preſident <hi>Bra.</hi> he demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of him what he had to ask of the Court. He was then
talking with <hi>Doriſlaus,</hi> and ſemeed not to mind the buſineſs of
the Court. His Majeſty ſitting near, takes his ſtick and thruſts
the Priſoner at the Bar upon his ſhoulder; and the Priſoner
looking back with a great deal of indignation turned about.
I did hear <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> ſpeaking to him in theſe words, Mr. <hi>Sol.</hi>
have you any thing to demand of the Court? whereupon the
priſoner at the Bar did uſe theſe or the like words? May it
pleaſe your Lordſhips, I have formerly in the name of the
Commons aſſembled in Parliament and the good people of
<hi>England</hi> exhibited a Charge of High Treaſon and other high
crimes againſt <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> the priſoner at the Bar, flinging
his head back in this manner to him. He had there further
to require of the Court that he might be demanded to make
poſitive anſwer, by confeſſion or denial; if not, that the Court
would take it <hi>pro confeſſo,</hi> and proceed according to Juſtice:
this was on the firſt day I was in the Court. The Preſident
<hi>Bradſhaw</hi> told, His Majeſty, that he heard what was cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:56280:72"/>
in the name of the Commons aſſembled in Parliament
and the good people of <hi>England</hi> againſt him by the now Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
at the Bar. The King ſtood up, but <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> prevented
him in what he had to ſay, telling of him that the Court
had given him time to that day to know when he
would plead to the Charge. His Majeſty proceeded to
object againſt the Juriſdiction, and ſaid he did demur to
the Juriſdiction of the Court; upon which the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
anſwered him, If you demur to the Juriſdiction of the
Court, you muſt know that the Court hath over-ruled your
demurrer, and you muſt plead to your Charge, guilty or
not guilty: upon that the King asked their authority, and
deſired he might give reaſons againſt it; he was denyed it
by the Preſident, the Preſident at laſt was content to tell him,
that though he was not ſatisfied with their authority, they
were, and he muſt: but to ſatisfie him, he told him in ſhort,
they ſat there by the ſupream authority of the Nation, the
Commons aſſembled in Parliament, by whom his Anceſton
ever were, and to whom he was accomptable; then the King
ſtood up, by your favour ſhew me one Preſident. <hi>Bradſhaw</hi>

asked what he had to ſay, whether guilty or not guilty: and
Preſident <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> ſaid that if he would not plead, they muſt
record his contempt. His Majeſty turned about to the people,
and ſaid, then remember that the King of <hi>England</hi> ſuffers
being not permitted to give his reaſons for the liberty of the
people: with that a great ſhout came from the people, crying,
<hi>God ſave the King:</hi> but there was an awe upon them, that they
could not expreſs themſelves as they would have done I
believe.</p>

                  <p>My Lords and Gentlemen of the Jury, I was at
the High Court of Juſtice, as they called it, the firſt, ſecond
and third daies, not to trouble you with the proceedings of
of <hi>Bradſhaw,</hi> I will tell you what I obſerved of this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
I have the notes that I took there, and pray that I may
read them to help my memory, which was granted, and then
proceeded in this manner, That day my Lord, Mr. <hi>Cook</hi>
told the Court that he charged the Priſoner at the Bar
(meaning the KING) with Treaſon and high miſdemeanors,
and deſired that the Charge might be read: the Charge was
this, That he had upheld a Tyrannical Government, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
for that cauſe was adjudged to be a Tyrant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and did
then preſs that the priſoner might give an anſwer to
that: and that very earneſtly. The ſecond day, my Lord,
he told the Court that he did the laſt day exhibit a Charged
High Treaſon againſt the Priſoner at the Bar, (meaning the
<hi>King)</hi> and that he did deſire he might make anſwer to it, and
he told them alſo, that inſtead of making an anſwer to
the Court, the <hi>King</hi> had delayed the Court, but deſired the
<hi>K.</hi> might make a poſitive anſwer, or otherwiſe that it might
be taken <hi>pro confeſſo.</hi> The third day my Lord he came and
told the Court as before, that the <hi>King</hi> had delayed then,
and then he charged him with the Higheſt Treaſons, and
Crimes that ever were acted upon the Theatre of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and then preſſed that Judgement might be given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him; and another expreſſion was, that it was not ſo
much He, but the Innocent and precious bloud that was ſhed,
that did crie for Judgment againſt the Priſoner at the Bar
this my Lord, in ſubſtance; there were other paſſages.</p>

                  <speaker>Cook.</speaker>
                  <p>Whether before this time he had not heard ſome

between the King, who was then a Priſoner, and the then
Preſident <hi>Bradſhaw;</hi> but concerning the Priſoner at the Bar,
this I very well remember, that upon Munday I heard him
ſay he had exhibited a Charge of High Treaſon againſt the
Priſoner (then the <hi>King)</hi> and demanded how that he might
plead to his charge, I do very well remember that after ſome
paſſages between the King and the Court, the Priſoner at
the Bar deſired the King might plead to his Charge, or elſe it
might be taken <hi>pro Confeſſo:</hi> I remember upon the laſt day,
the day of that fatal Sentence, I heard the Priſoner at the
Bar demand in the name of the Commons aſſembled in Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament,
and all the good people of <hi>England,</hi> Judgement upon
the Priſoner at the Bar, pointing to the King; <hi>this is all.</hi>

I owe all my knowledge in the Laws to that Gentleman:

to do me, and ſeveral other Gentlemen now and then the
favour to reaſon the Law with us, and aſſiſt us in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the long Parliament, that is, to give you an accompt of
his being indebted, he did deſire I would do my endeavour
to get his Protection. Near the time of the Kings Trial there
was a Gentleman with my ſelf, one <hi>Samuel Palmer</hi> of <hi>Grays-Inne,</hi>
which frequented his Company, had ſeveral nights
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:56280:74"/>
the opportunity of underſtanding the affairs at <hi>Weſtmin.</hi> and
truly he himſelf did ſeem to us to count that a very ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Council. I remember what he ſaid one night, I think
they are all mad, which was within two or three days before
the Kings tryal, and inſtanced how a Fellow cryed out to
the Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> that if he did not conſent to the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
he would kill Chriſt and him. After that I did not
think he did go to this Council for imployment, but out of
curioſity: when the King came to Tryal, we heard that
Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> was the perſon that was Solicitor, and Acted that
part that you have heard of, and that during that Tryal,
whether the ſecond or third day, I cannot ſay that certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> came to <hi>Grays-Inne</hi> that evening about Ten
or Eleven of the clock at might, only upon ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
occaſion as he ſaid, I being walking in the Court in
the walk before my Chamber with another Gentleman, I
did ſee him paſs out of a houſe to go back again, I thought
it was he, called after him, Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> ſaid I, upon that he
turned back and met me, I took him by the hand, ſaid I, I
hear you are up to the ears in this buſineſs, no ſaith he, I <hi>am
ſerving the people;</hi> truly ſaid I, I believe there is a thouſand
to one will not give you thanks; ſaid I, I hear you charge
the King for the levying war againſt the Parliament, how
can you rationally do this, when you have pulled out the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
to make way to his Trial? he anſwered me, <hi>you will
ſee ſtrange things, and you muſt wait upon God.</hi> I did ask him,
but firſt he ſaid this of himſelf, ſaid he, he <hi>was as gracious and
wiſe a Prince as any was in the world,</hi> which made me reflect
upon him again, and asked how he could preſs thoſe things as
I have heard? what anſwer he made to that, I cannot tell, I
did by the way inquire what he thought concerning the
King, whether he muſt ſuffer or no, he told me <hi>he muſt die,
and Monarchy muſt die with him.</hi>

                  <p>My Lord, I have been a Priſoner three months, I
humbly deſire to acknowledge his Majeſties and his Councils
favour that I was not put into a <hi>Jeremy</hi>'s Priſon, but in the
<hi>Tower</hi> and not in <hi>Irons:</hi> I give your Lordſhips humble thanks
for that, and truly conſidering the nature of the Charge,
had it been in ſome other Kingdom, they would have ſerved
us as <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> in priſon, I thank you that I have a fair
Trial with the <hi>Judges</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> who are upon their
Oaths to do equal right and juſtice between our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Lord the King, and every Priſoner concerning mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of life and death, and likewiſe thoſe Noble Lords that
though they are not put upon their Oaths but upon their
honour, if they know any Law to preſerve my life, I truſt
they will rather ſave than deſtroy. My Lords, I do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſay as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, my plea is much of that nature, <hi>againſt
the Law, and againſt</hi> Caeſar, <hi>I hope I have not offended at all,</hi>
and ſo I have pleaded not guilty. The learned Council
have examined ſeveral witneſſes againſt me; and I humbly
conceive that the matter will reſt in a very narrow compaſs:
the ſubſtance of the Charge (ſo far as my memory will ſerve)
doth reſt in theſe three things, the other being but mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of form. <hi>That I with others ſhould propound, conſult,
contrive and imagine the Death of the late King.</hi> Secondly,
<hi>That to the perfecting, and bringing about this wicked and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
conſpiracy, that I with others did aſſume a Power, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>
(as I remember) power I am ſure, <hi>then to kill and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the King:</hi> &amp; thirdly, <hi>That there was a perſon unknown that
did cut off the Kings head, and that we were abetting, aiding,
aſſiſting, countenancing, and procuring the perſon:</hi> (or words

                     </gap>ve twelve poor words to offer for my ſelf in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
wherein if I do not anſwer every thing that hath
been particularly objected, I hope you will give me leave
afterwards to offer it. Firſt, I humbly propound this,
that if it was not made appear to your Lordſhips that I
did ever propound, conſult; adviſe, contrive, attempt,
or any way plot, or counſel the death of His Majeſtie;
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:56280:75"/>
then I hope, I cannot be found guilty within the Statute.
of 25. <hi>Edward</hi> the third, for the naked truth, <hi>Mr. Nut<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly</hi>
hath in a great part ſpoke to, I was appointed upon
the tenth of <hi>January</hi> 1648. for to give my advice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
a Charge, there having been upon the ninth a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
for the Trial, and upon the tenth <hi>Mr. Steel,</hi> Dr.
<hi>Doriſlaus,</hi> and <hi>Mr. Ask</hi> and my ſelf were appointed, and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be of Council to draw up a Charge; Here I have

                  <speaker>Cook.</speaker>
                  <p>Then I humbly conceive that that cannot be ſaid to
be done maliciouſly, or adviſedly, or with any wicked inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in me, which I was required and commanded to do; Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only within my Sphere and Element as a Counſellour &amp;
no otherwiſe. The next thing is this, my L. that by Law words
will not amount unto Treaſon, we uſually ſay, that words
may declare an Heretick, but not a Traytor; there were
ſome Statutes formerly 1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. were words are made Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
but they are all repealed by 1 <hi>Mariae,</hi> that nothing ſhall
be Treaſon but what is expreſſed in 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. this Objection
will ſeem to lye, that theſe were words put in writing, and
that I humbly conceive to be the greateſt matter objected, to
which I anſwer, 1. Whether there be any full, certain, clear
proof that that is my hand to the Charge, I muſt leave to
you; two or three witneſſes ſay they believe it, &amp; that
it is like my hand, that I leave to you, if that appear, yet
(My Lord) that that is put in writing as done by another that
is the Dictator, and does dictate unto me, I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that for any man to write words, which in their own
nature may be Treaſonable, if he doth but write them by
the command of another, by ſpeaking them after another,
taking them upon rebound, that is not Treaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they do not diſcover a trayterous heart; Thoſe words
of compaſſing the death of the King in the 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. they
are ſecret imaginations in the heart, and they muſt be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
by ſome overtact; that which was dictated (my Lord)
unto me, that I had expreſly preſcribed me, what I ſhould
ſay, what words I ſhould ſay. That I did not invent any
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:56280:76"/>
thing of mine own head, of my own conceit, and therefore
cannot properly be ſaid to be malicious. The next thing that
I crave leave to offer is this, that the pure and plain deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and praying of Juſtice, though injuſtice be done upon
it, cannot poſſibly be called Treaſon within the ſtatute, then
I hope nothing that has been ſaid againſt me will amount to
Treaſon: for the words in the natural, grammatical, plain,
genuine and legal ſence will bear no other conſtruction, as I
humbly conceive, but (that whereas thoſe Gentlemen had his
Majeſtie then in their power a Priſoner) that it was prayed
by me, that they would do him juſtice; I do hope, that
it will appear that I did give <hi>Bonum &amp; fidele Conſilium.</hi> It
will appear, I hope, that ſome would have had a very volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous
and long charge, that I was utterly againſt it, as
conceiving that it was not fit and requiſite, that any thing
ſhould be put in, at leaſt I durſt not invent one word my ſelf
but what was expreſſed in the Act for tryal, if your Lordſhips
will not admit it an act, you will an Order, and ſo it will bear
me forth, at leaſt to excuſe me from Treaſon, becauſe I kept
my ſelf to the words, whereas in that it was ſaid that they
ſhould proceed according to the merits of the cauſe, I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
that, that I did not underſtand that, but according to
Juſtice, &amp; that is but according to Law, becauſe the Law is the
rule of Juſtice. I do humbly hope (my Lord) that if by Law
when words may be taken in a double ſence, they ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
have the more favourable interpretation, much more
when the words in the legal ſence will bear it; when it is
prayed they will proceed according to juſtice, I hope it will
not be inferred, there was any intention of doing injuſtice,
when juſtice was required. And therefore (my Lord) the next
word what I would offer is this, if my Lord, in all Tragedies
which are, as we call them, judicially, or colourably, there
are but theſe four Actors: Accuſers, or, Witneſſes, The Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
Judges and Executioner. If I be none of theſe, I cannot
be Guilty of Treaſon. I hope I may ſafely ſay according to
Law, that I had not a hand at all in his Majeſties death.
My Lord, the Court and Councel, it is very true,
they do aim at the ſame thing, the Councel <hi>Require<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>

Juſtitiam,</hi> the other <hi>Exequendo Juſtitiam,</hi> the end being the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:56280:76"/>
ſame, to have Juſtice. If when juſtice be demanded, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
be done, what is that to the Councel? we read to of
<hi>John</hi> concerning <hi>Pilate. Knoweſt thou not</hi> (ſpeaking to Chriſt)
<hi>that I have power to crucifie thee, and have power to releaſe thee?</hi>
My Lord, I humbly anſwer this to that which ſeems to
be the moſt material part in the Indictment, that We did
aſſume a Power, My Lords, I did not aſſume a power, I
hope it will not be ſaid that the Councel had any power,
<hi>Eloquentia</hi> in the Councel, <hi>Judicium</hi> in the <hi>Judges,</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas</hi>
in the Witneſſes. 25. Acts. <hi>Tertullus,</hi> that eloquent
Orator, accuſed <hi>Paul, Paul</hi> anſwered for himſelf, and
it is ſaid <hi>Feſtus</hi> being willing to do the <hi>Jews</hi> a courteſie,
he left <hi>Paul</hi> bound, it was not the Councel that left him
bound. His Majeſty was never a Priſoner to me, and I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
laid any hands upon him; if any witneſſes have ſpoke
of any irreverence, I muſt appeal to God in that I did not
in the leaſt manner carry my ſelf undutifully to his Majeſty,
though one of the Witneſſes was pleaſed to ſay, that I ſaid
theſe words, <hi>that there is a Charge againſt the Priſoner at the
Bar;</hi> It was not ſaid the <hi>Priſoner at the Bar,</hi> there was not
one diſreſpective word from me. There is a Caſe in the
third <hi>Inſtitutes</hi> of the Lord <hi>Cook,</hi> it is to this purpoſe. That
one wilfully and knowingly forſwore himſelf, the Caſe was
put to inveigle the Court, and though the Court does inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
upon a falſe Oath, it is not injuſtice at all in the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
it is Perjury in him; if there can be no injuſtice in a
Witneſs, much leſs a Counſeller can be ſaid to have his hand
in the death of any, becauſe he has no power at all; this
muſt needs follow, that if it ſhall be conceived to be Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for a Counſeller to plead againſt his Majeſty, then it
will be Felony to plead againſt any man that is condemned
unjuſtly for Felony. The Counſellour is to make the beſt of
his Clients cauſe, then to leave it to the Court; it is ſaid, I
ſhould demand judgement, I do not remember that, I leave
it to you, but ſtill to demand Juſtice. Counſellers they do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
in buſineſs before they do rightly underſtand the true
matter of the fact, it is part of a <hi>Serjeants</hi> Oath, that ſo ſoon
as he does diſcover the falſity of the Cauſe, he ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
the Cauſe. My Lord, by what Mr. <hi>Nutly</hi> hath ſaid, it
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:56280:77"/>
appears, and I have many Witneſſes in the Countrey, three
or four in <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> would have ſpoken full to this, that
(my Lord) there was not before the Sentence of the King
(to the beſt of my knowledge) a word ſpoken by any, that
they did intend to put him to death; I ſay, to my knowledge,
and my Lord, when Judgement is demanded, is it not two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold,
of Acquittal and Condemnation? if thoſe that then
were entruſted with the power of Judicature, if they did
not know any Law to proceed by to take away his Majeſty,
then I demanding their Judgement, it doth not appear to be
my Judgement; and I refer it to the learned Councel, that
Councel many times at the Aſſiſes and other Courts have
been ſorry that the Verdict hath been given for their Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
when they have known the right lay on the other ſide;
and ſo I might in this. The next thing I humbly offer, is
that if in right reaſon conſidering the condition his Majeſty
was then in, the adviſing to draw up the Charge, was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be looked upon as a matter of ſervice than diſſervice,
then it cannot be called Treaſon it is very true my Lord,
that a very ſmall little Overt act will amount to a Treaſon,
and my Lord, had this been in times of peace, and had His
Majeſty been no Priſoner, (now he was under the power of
an Army) this had been great Treaſon; but he being a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner,
not by my means, (for I was no ſword-man) what
can a man that knows himſelf innocent, being a Priſoner, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
more than a ſpeedy Tryal? ſo that making the Tryal
more ſpeedy cannot be ſaid to be done trayterouſly. A
Tryal doth follow impriſonment as naturally and neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as the ſhadow doth the body. If any man ſhall deſire and
be inſtrumental in bringing him to a Tryal which might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
rather than condemn him, and ſo humbly pray proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
according to Juſtice, this will have I hope a better name
than Treaſon. I am much beholding to His Majeſty and this
honourable Parli. for the penning of the Act of <hi>Indempnity,</hi>
which I hope my L. you will give me leave to take notice of.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, the words that I would make uſe of, are
in the beginning, Treaſon, Murder and other Felonies that
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:56280:77"/>
are ſpoken of, they are ſaid to be counſelled, commanded, act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or done; in the preamble which is as the Key to open the
mind and meaning of the Law-makers, it is ſaid that all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
ſhall be pardoned for all, excepting ſuch as ſhall be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
and in ſuch manner as they ſhall be excepted, and then
it comes, provided that this Act ſhall not extend to pardon
ſuch and ſuch perſons, and by name, I am one; and it is ſaid,
all which perſons for their execrable Treaſon in Sentencing
to death, or ſigning the Inſtrument for the horrid murther,
or being inſtrumental in taking away the precious life of
our late Soveraign Lord <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt of glorious memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
are left to be proceeded againſt as Traytors to his late
Majeſty, according to the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and are out of
the ſaid Act wholly excepted, and foreprized. There is
not any thing offered againſt me upon the two <hi>1ſt.</hi> great
words, which are Sentencing and ſigning, that which I have
to do to endeavour to clear my ſelf is this being inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
in taking away the life of his ſaid Majeſty, firſt I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
offer this to the Juries conſideration. That where
the Parliament doth begin to fix the treaſonable part, there
I hope, and no otherwiſe this honourabe Court will fix it: if it
had been the Intention that Counſellors, adviſers, and ſuch as
ſpoke their minds ſometimes in the buſineſs (you know that
was Epidemical) many words were ſpoken which cannot be
juſtified; whether naturally it would not have followed, that
all ſuch perſons for their counſelling, adviſing or being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental,
are left to be proceeded againſt as Traytors, I
hope you will take that into conſideration: concerning the
words, or being inſtrumental, obſerve it is not ſaid, or being
any otherwaies inſtrumental, but Sentencing, ſigning or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inſtrumental, if therefore the word Inſtrumental be not
of a general comprehenſive nature, then all this evidence
which hath been given in againſt me, being before the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencing
and ſigning, will fall to the ground; that this is the
legal, genuine, and Grammatical ſenſe, &amp; cannot be any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
than as particular, as if it were the Sentencer, ſigner, &amp;
Executioner, which if it had been ſo, nothing of the Evidence
would have reached me. My argument is this, ſuch a uſe is to
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:56280:78"/>
be made of an Act of Parliament, that no word may be fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
and inſignificant, but if this Interpretation ſhall be put
upon it, ſentencing, ſigning, or being any way inſtrumental,
then the words, Sentencing, and Signing, need not have been,
if Inſtrumental will carry the words Sentencing, and ſigning,
then theſe words will carry no force atall, eſpecially, my Lord,
when there is no need of any retroſpect at all, if it be ſo,
I know not how far it may look back; there is no neceſſity of
putting any comprehenſive generality upon this word inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental,
but that the plain natural ſenſe will be this; That
thoſe, that did ſentence and Sign, and thoſe that were inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
in taking away his life, that is, thoſe that did abet, and
comfort that perſon unknown, or juſtifie, or countenance him,
which is after the Sentencing, and not before in the legal
ſenſe. Next I conceive that a Councellor cannot be ſaid to do
any thing, <hi>vi &amp; armis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is ſaid that by force and Arms I did abet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical
to ſay that words may be as Swords, but legal it is not,
unleſs there be ſomething <hi>vi &amp; armis,</hi> in the Grammatical
ſenſe, inſtrumental in taking away the Kings life, it is not
ſaid inſtrumental in order to take away the K. life, or inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
in adviſing to take away the K. life, but inſtrumental
in taking away the K. life. My Lord, The next thing is, that
there cannot be any thing to be ſaid to be done by me, firſt
not <hi>falſo,</hi> becauſe in that ſenſe it muſt have the operation of
mendacity, that there muſt be a lie told in it, I did nothing but
what I was required to do, to ſet down ſuch and ſuch words,
I did not invent nor contrive them, I heard nothing of it till
the tenth day of <hi>Jan.</hi> My Lord, for <hi>malitioſe,</hi> that I did not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing maliciouſly, I hope it will appear in this, what I then
ſpoke, it was for my Fee, it may be called <hi>avaritia</hi> but not
<hi>malitia,</hi> for the Law will imply a malice but when there is
no other expreſs ground or reaſon why the thing was done,
but here was an expreſs ground to ſpeak for my Fee, I hope
the Jury will take that into conſideration. Then Secondly, I
was not Judicial in the Caſe, I was not Magiſterial as any
Officer, but miniſterial. As touching examining of witneſſes,
it is a great miſtake, the Court had power to give an Oath;
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:56280:78"/>
I might be there; but I had no power to give an Oath, but
whether I might ask any queſtion, I do not remember, but
that I ſhould give an Oath, that is a falſity; then my Lord,
for <hi>proditorie,</hi> I hope there is nothing at all that appears to
the Jury: ſo that there was no malice nor trayterous intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the thing. There are ſome matters of Law which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
your Lordſhips will give me leave to ſpeak to, and
that your Lordſhips will be of Counſel with me. I would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
ſomething concerning his Majeſties gracious Declaration
from <hi>Breda</hi> to the Parliament (I was then in <hi>Ireland)</hi> I did
put in a Petition to the honourable Commiſſioners before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
exception was, that I might have the benefit of that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
I did lay hold of it. My Lords there are two things
in that Declaration that I would offer. His Majeſty ſaith
that for the reſtoring of the Kings Peers and people of the
Kingdom to their juſt rights and liberties, He will grant a
free and general Pardon to all, excepting ſuch as ſhall be by
Parliament excepted, and within three or four lines after it is
ſaid a free Parliament, though I do not in the leaſt queſtion
the Legality of this Parliament, yet my Lords to this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
purpoſe, whether the Parliament that was to except
ought not to be a Parliament that was to be called accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his Majeſties Writ, according to the Laws of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
I humbly conceive it will bear that, though His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
is pleaſed to confirm this, yet it is not ſuch a Parliament
that was to except, that I offer to your Lordſhips. My Lords,
that that I would humbly make hold to put for my ſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is the priviledge of one in my condition, is this. There
is my Lord, many Lords, the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> the Earl of <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton,</hi>
and others that were adjudged in the 44 of <hi>Eliz.</hi> 3.
inſtitutes, they did trayterouſly and maliciouſly conſpire to
take her Majeſty Priſoner, and to remove her Counſellours
from her, which were found guilty and ſuffered accordingly;
the reaſon is, That becauſe thereby if it had been done, they
had deſpoiled her Maje. of her Regal Government, &amp; the caſe
is inſtant in <hi>Philip</hi> who was a nominative King, that it was
not Treaſon to have attempted any thing againſt him. My
Lords, his Majeſty being a Priſoner without any hand of
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:56280:79"/>
mine, I giving advice according to what was dictated to me
to bring him to that tryal, whereby he might have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted,
and ſo ſet at liberty: I hope that will not be ſaid as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental.
My Lords, I humbly ſhall offer but two words,
1. to honourable Court, then to the Jury, the words of
<hi>25 E.</hi> 3. and ſo the expoſition of the learned Judges have
been from time to time, that there ſhll be no ſemblable
Treaſons made by preſumptions or ſtrains of wit, but thoſe
Treaſons ſpecified there; It is ſaid if a Husband do kill his
Wife, or a Wife kill her Husband, a Maſter ſhould kill his
Servant, or the Servant ſhould kill his Maſter, that that ſhall
be petty Treaſon; a Child did kill his Father, though that
was looked upon as a great ſin, yet the Judges do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
that to be Treaſon, becauſe it was not in the very
words: this being an extraordinary Caſe: to write a thing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
another, doth not appear there was a malicious heart in
him that did write. There hath been the Act of Parlia. that
doth call theſe Courts Tyrannical and Unlawful Courts; but
my Lords, a Tyrannical and Unlawful Court is a Court <hi>de
facto,</hi> though not <hi>de jure;</hi> if a Court be not a juſt and lawful
Court, it cannot be ſaid but that it is a Court: we ſay a Thief
is a true man, though morally he is not ſo; this was a Court,
Officers attending on them, ſome ſaid they had Authority, &amp;
therefore for one to come and act within his Sphere, not to
act out of that, nor to do any thing, but what he had a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript
form appointed him, I hope that will not be found to
be within the letter of the Law; I have been told (how true,
I cannot tell) that there have been ſome votes in the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Parliament, that thoſe that did only counſel or adviſe,
thoſe were not to be looked upon as Traytors; I have been
told ſo, that thoſe that did only ſpeak as Councel for their
Fee, who were not the contrivers of it, the Parliament did
not intend they ſhould be left to be proceeded againſt.</p>

                  <p>That Letter that was ſent from the Commons to
the King at <hi>Breda,</hi> they ſpeak firſt of the violation that was
put upon the Parliament, and of the baſe horrid Murther of
his late Majeſty. It is ſaid that the Parliament (I conceive
they meant of the remaining part) they were not guilty,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:56280:79"/>

my acting, that if it may not in a legal ſenſe any way
be ſaid to be an Act of the Parliament and Commons, yet it
may be ſaid to be ſuch an order to bear out thoſe that did
Act according to it, becauſe there was then no other autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>de facto,</hi> otherwiſe it were not lawful for any man to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
his profeſſion during ſuch a Power. I hope, Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors
might then exerciſe their profeſſion, aſwel as others:
My Lord, though I ſhould ſuffer my ſelf in this caſe, I ſhould
be loth the honourable profeſſion of the Law ſhould. I think
I was in my Sphere acting as a Counſellor. Now Gentlemen
of the Jury, that which I have to ſay to you, is an evidence
concerning matter of life, it muſt be ſo clear that every one
that hears it may underſtand it. It is called an evidence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is evident, it is one reaſon, why Priſoners for their
lives are not allowed Counſel for matter of fact, becauſe the
evidence is, and ought to be ſo clear and plain that every
one ſhould be ſatisfied both Jury and ſtanders by, and it is a
proper word to ſay the Priſoner is convicted, that is as
much as his mouth is ſtopped, and therefore I ſay, truly as I
hope, I may ſpeak it to you without offence, as <hi>Jeremy</hi> in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Caſe, when ſome of the people would have had them
put him to death, <hi>as for me behold I am in your hand, do with
me as ſeemeth good and meet unto you.</hi> 26. Jer. 14, 15. <hi>ver.</hi>
ſaith he, <hi>But know ye for certain, that if ye put me to death, ye
ſhall ſurely bring innocent blood upon your ſelves.</hi> I hope you will
not willingly be Guilty of any ſuch thing, I muſt leave it to
your conſciences whether you believe, that I had an hand in
the K. Death, when I did write but only that which others
did dictate unto me, and when I ſpoke only for my Fee, and
this I would be bold to ſay, though the argument is not ſo
directly confeſſed, that humane Juſtice, (I do firſt ſay as this
my principle, and opinion is) that as every man ought to pay
his moral debts, ſo all political debts, there is a debt due to
human Juſtice, ſo political, if the Lord ſhould have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:56280:80"/>
me to have been drunk and kill'd a man for which I
ought to have died, in ſtead of ſpeaking for my ſelf, I
would have rather intreated the Jury to have found
me Guilty, I think theſe things ought to be anſwered
political debts; when I was in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and had opportunity
of going away, if I thought I had been Guilty I might have
done it, my name is put into his Majeſties Proclamation. It
is true, I was a priſoner three or four months before, ſo that
I could not render my ſelf, to what end ſhould that Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
mention my name? it was laid I obſcured my ſelf,
but I did not, humane Juſtice doth never puniſh, ſo much for
expiation as for prevention; The judgements of the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Aquinas, Grotius,</hi> and <hi>Ameſius,</hi> and many others, that if a
man doth kill a man, commit any thing worthy of death,
though he doth repent never ſo much, yet that others may be
deterred from committing ſuch Acts, the Magiſtrate is bound
to put him to death. But where there is not ſuch a thing, there
it is different; though it is ſaid the land is defiled, that is,
where there is danger that the like may be committed again,
now all things are ſetled, there is no danger at all, now there
can never come ſuch a caſe as this again, I ſay my Lord what
I acted I did as a Counſellor, I had no malitious intention in
it. Mr. <hi>Nutley</hi> bare teſtimony ſo far, that I told him <hi>there
was not intention of putting his Majeſty to death,</hi> I only did ſay,
that <hi>I deſired them to do Juſtice,</hi> and I hope what was done, was
their Act not mine, and ſo I leave my ſelf to your Lordſhips.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, this Gentleman who is the priſoner at
the Bar requires ſuch an evidence of the Fact, as may be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
he ſaith ſo evident as may be as clear as the Sun, I think
that evidence is not to ſeek, but if he muſt never be convicted
till he be ſo far convinced as to be ſpeechleſs, I believe we may
ſtay long enough, nevertheleſs if he be willing (as he ſaith he
is) to pay his debts to political Juſtice, we ſhall quickly give
him the total ſum. That which he hath ſaid, hath been like a
<hi>Lawyer,</hi> the beſt that his Caſe will bear, but withal it is a great
aggravation to his Crime, that he that knew the <hi>Law</hi> ſo well
ſhould ſo much tranſgreſs it. He began, <hi>Words do not make trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:56280:80"/>
he miſtakes, his Charge is not for words, Gentlemen, his
Charge is for <hi>compaſſing and imagining the Death of the King,</hi>
and the evidence of that Charge is meeting in that Aſſembly,
and the part that he bore in that Aſſembly. And yet my Lords
he will be much miſtaken too: (under favour, and with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to your Lordſhips Judgement, and thoſe that hear
him,) if they think that in all Caſes it is a general rule, that
words are no Treaſon; for when a man ſhall proceed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the imagination of his heart, as to exhort and perſwade
men to effect that wicked thing, <hi>The killing of the</hi> K., certainly
there cannot be a greater overt act than theſe words, nor a
clearer evidence of ſuch an imagination, <hi>for out of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of the heart the mouth ſpeaks.</hi> My L. to ſay that the demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Juſtice is not Treaſon, though injuſtice do follow, is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
weak gloſs upon a wicked action. The Subject matter was a
Charge of <hi>High Treaſon againſt the King,</hi> the concluſion of
the Charge was a <hi>Proteſtation,</hi> by which he ſaved to himſelf
a Liberty to put in a new Charge, if that was not ſufficient;
upon the whole he deſires that the King <hi>as a Traytor</hi> may be
brought to Juſtice. Judge you now Gentlemen upon the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of this demand, whether this were ſuch a demand of
Juſtice as might end in acquital; Whether he that preſſes that
this Charge may be taken <hi>pro Confeſſo,</hi> did mean that when
the Court had recorded it, they ſhould acquit him when
they had done. My Lords, to ſay there are four Actors in this
Caſe, the Witneſs, or accuſer, the Judge, the Jury, and the
Executioner, and that he is none of them, and therefore in
this Caſe he cannot be a Traytor: ſtill my Lord that is to beg
the queſtion, for if he be one of them that did Aſſemble in
the place, and were any inſtrument of that Aſſembly, he hath
thereby given an evidence of an Overtact of his wicked heart,
&amp; when all is done this poor gloſs amounts but to this, <hi>I am
none of thoſe four Ranks, that is, there were others worſe than my
ſelf, and therefore I am none at all.</hi> My Lord, the thing that he
hath mainly inſiſted upon is the Act of Indempnity, my Lord,
he doth obſerve that his name is excepted in that Act, That
he doth hope that it is ſo pen'd as by the favour of the Parl.
It may reach his Caſe, &amp; he hath argued very much upon it,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:56280:81"/>
and he ſpeaks as if he did believe it himſelf. But ſurely there
is no colour for that interpretation, that he ſhould ſtep out
of this proviſo, by the very Act of <hi>Indempnity</hi> that was made on
purpoſe to bring him in by-Name, the words are <hi>provided that
this Act nor any thing therein contained, ſhall extend to Pardon or
give any benefit to</hi> John Cook, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which perſons for their
execrable. Treaſons in Sentencing to Death or ſigning the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
for the horrid Murder, or being inſtrumental in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
away the precious Life of our late Sovereign Lord <hi>King
Charles</hi> the Firſt of glorious Memory, are left to be proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
againſt as Traytors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Firſt, my Lord, this general and
clear anſwer I conceive is to be given, that the Priſoner at
the Bar being by Name excepted out of the Act of <hi>Indemnity,</hi>
by the <hi>proviſo</hi> mentioned in it although the ſubſequent lines
that follow be the reaſons why the Parlim. do except: yet if
he be within the very words of the Exception, whether he
be in the reaſons that moved them to that exception is not
material, if he could diſtinguiſh that he was not inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
in that ſenſe to which he labours to reſtrain this Proviſo,
he can but ſay this, the Parliament was miſtaken in their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
but not in their concluſion, but he is directly within the
exception and the reaſon of it too, for the word inſtrumental
goes as far as far can be, and he is properly &amp; literally in the
ſtrict notion of the word, an inſtrument of the death of the
King: The King could never have been brought to death, if
not to the Bar; never had been ſentenced, if he had not been
impeached; that impeachment could never have been taken
<hi>pro Confeſſo,</hi> nor the impeachment it ſelf delivered, if he had
not delivered the one, and preſſed the other: He that brought
the Axe from the <hi>Tower</hi> was not more inſtrumental than he,
and beſides a Lawyer as he, of great underſtanding and of
good parts, he knows very well there are no acceſſaries in
Treaſon, but he that Acts any part in ſo wicked a Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
let him begin at what end he will, he ſtands reſponſible
for the utmoſt conſequence of it, and in effect the very pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of this proviſo, is an expreſs Judgement of Parliament,
that he was inſtrumental, but that is not to be preſſed.</p>
                  <p>The next thing he doth inſiſt upon is, the Declaration of
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:56280:81"/>
his Majeſty, that he ſent from <hi>Breda,</hi> which he ſaith he laid
hold upon; here lies the weight of his anſwer, The King
writes his Letter to the Parliament now ſitting, that he doth
purpoſe, for the quieting of the hearts of men that may be in
doubt, to pardon all perſons, all crimes of what nature ſoever,
either againſt himſelf or Royal Father, excepting thoſe which
ſhall be byAct of Parliament excepted, and my Lord, he doth
ſay, and modeſtly preſſes, that he doth conceive the meaning
of that is to pardon all perſons, what crimes ſoever they
have committed; Except ſuch as by a Free Parliament ſhall
be excepted, a legal Parliament called by the Writ of the
King, which this Parliament is not. To that I give theſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers;
Firſt, my Lord, I do ſay that this letter of our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Soveraign from <hi>Breda</hi> in it ſelf undoubtedly is no Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
in Law for Treaſon, that cannot be without the Broad
Seal. Next, a Pardon under the Great Seal in ſuch a form of
words as this is, would not be a Pardon for Treaſon, for that
muſt not be pardoned by implication, but by poſitive words;
ſo in the Caſe of Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> a Commiſſion directed to
our well be loved Subject, would not pardon the Treaſon, of
which he was condemned. In the next place this Letter at
the moſt is but a pardon in honour, which muſt always be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
according to the meaning; And that the Kings Honour
may for ever be ſacred, I ſay this Letter doth no way help the
Priſoner at the Bar.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is plain by the very Superſcription of this Letter,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> which the Declaration was incloſed, that it is directed to
the Speaker of Our Houſe of Commons in Parliament aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
which cannot poſſibly be expounded of any other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
than that, which was then ſitting, to whoſe Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
it was written.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Letter it ſelf ſays; we have left it to you to
provide for ſecurity and Indempnity, and again, if there be a
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ying ſin for which the Nation may be involved in infamy,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> cannot doubt, but you will be as ſolicitous to vindicate
as we can be. And then in this very letter encloſeth that
declaration, upon the penning of which the priſoner ſo
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:56280:82"/>
much relies; Now lay all together, and it is clear the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
meant by the Declaration, muſt be the ſame Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which was meant by the Letter, and that was this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Parliament whom the King intended to truſt, both with
Indempnity, and with the vindication of his Fathers death,
and to be the diſpenſers both of mercy and Juſtice in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.
Another thing is this, This very Parliament as
the Priſoner obſerves, they did go to the King according
to His gracious letter, and in the behalf of all the good
people of <hi>England,</hi> they did lay hold of the Kings mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in His letter, and Declaration, and prayed that this claim
by their Speaker in the behalf of all the reſt of the Commons
of <hi>England</hi> might be effectual to all purpoſes, and for all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
other than thoſe that ſhould be by themſelves afterward
excepted, according to their requeſts. His Majeſty accepts
their Petition, and makes Proclamation, that his Pardon ſhould
extend to all, but ſuch as they ſhould except, what can be
more clear and evident, than that this is the Parliament which
the K. did mean to be the very Parliament, to which the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſhould have reference till the Act of Oblivion was paſſed
again? the late tranſactions of theſe twelve years paſt, had
involved ſo many perſons, that we could ſcarce find a man his
he had need of mercy, nay this very Parliament to which the
Letter was written, had need of Indempnity, and it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in the nature of the thing, or can it be underſtood by any
man, that the King writing to this Parliament, and offering
them pardon and Indempnity, ſhould mean ſuch a pardon and
Indempnity, as future Parliament to be called by his own
Writ ſhould be willing to afford them? Whoſe hearts would
have been ſatisfied with ſo contingent a ſecurity?</p>
                  <p>My Lords, upon the whole matter by what the King hath
ſaid in this Letter, and by what the Parlim. hath done in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance
thereof, and by what the King hath proclaimed, it is
to my underſtanding as clear as the noon day, that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the King is not concerned at all in the exemption of
the priſoner at the Bar; and for the Caſes of my Lord of <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex</hi>
and <hi>Southampton</hi> which he hath cited, they make againſt
him, they were condemned, becauſe they endeavoured to
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:56280:82"/>
impriſon the Queen, and to remove her Councellours, of
which very fact the Priſoner is in Law guilty too; and then
the caſe of King <hi>Philip,</hi> the Husband of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> makes
nothing for him neither, unleſs he will ſpeak out, and tell us
plainly, that becauſe by a former violence the King was made
a priſoner, he became but like a titular King as King <hi>Philip.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the next place he ſaith, my Caſe is out of the Law, I act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as a Councellour in my own particular for my Fee, it was
<hi>avaritia,</hi> but not <hi>malitia,</hi> nor <hi>falſo, malitioſe,</hi> or <hi>Proditorie.</hi>
But he muſt know, that no man hath or can have a lawful
calling, to purſue the life of his King, and the Law implies
malice; for <hi>malitioſe</hi> and <hi>proditorie,</hi> are not only words of
courſe, but of truth too in this caſe, elſe it were as much as
to ſay, that no Councel can be guilty of High Treaſon, than
which nothing can be more abſurd: My Lord, for that which
he ſaid laſt (for I muſt omit ſome things, and give him leave
to take the advantage of it) to ſtand upon it, that the place
was a Court, ſuch a one it was, that he was not anſwerable for
the conſtitution of it, if it were not in a legal ſenſe, it was ſuch
an order as might bear him out, that is, with modeſty and
good manners to juſtifie High Treaſon; it is not with ſuch
inſolency as ſome others before him did it, but it amounts to
that, That an order of a few perſons that firſt made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
a <hi>Parliament,</hi> and then made a Court of Juſtice, had Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
and met together, and perfected ſo great a Treaſon: I
ſay that this Order, to bear him out is impoſſible. He that is a
Lawyer, he muſt accompt to the Laws for what he hath done,
if the authority were not lawful, he cannot but know that this
which he calls the <hi>Parliam.</hi> was ſo far from a legal Authority,
that it was one part of the Treaſon that he did aſſiſt ſuch an
Aſſembly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gentlemen of the Jury,</hi> this is your own Caſe, here is a charge
that is exhibited by the priſoner at the Bar, as he ſaith, in the
name of all the people of <hi>England.</hi> Look to it, for you are
ſome of them if you own it, then it may be true what he hath
ſaid, but I hope you meet here to tell this Nation and all the
world that the people of <hi>England</hi> had no hand in that charge,
do but conſider how that this priſoner at the Bar had hunted
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:56280:83"/>
the life of the <hi>King,</hi> how he did fiſh out and examine evidence
whether the <hi>King</hi> ſet up his Standard at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> was at
ſuch a place and ſuch a place, to what end is all this, but with
deſign of blood? Were theſe things to be produced againſt
the <hi>King,</hi> and then Judgement to be demanded that he may
be ſaved? Is it not plainly proved to you by Witneſſes, how
he did exhibit the Charge, preſs it, aggravate it, deſired it
might be taken <hi>pro confeſſo,</hi> was afflicted with the delays, how
angry he was when he was interrupted? Is it not proved to
you that he was at firſt againſt the thing, and ſaid <hi>it was a baſe
buſineſs?</hi> when he was engaged in it ſaid, that he was <hi>a Servant
of the people of this Kingdome?</hi> what doth he do at laſt when the
thing had gone far? he ſpeaks that which is the only truth
which I have yet heard from him, <hi>He muſt dye, and Monarchy
then muſt periſh with him;</hi> from which Event, good Lord deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

that the Priſoner hath made at the Bar, with much
skill and cunning, may be referred to two heads. The
firſt to the Statute of the 25 of <hi>Edward</hi> the 3. The ſecond
to the late Act of <hi>Oblivion:</hi> for the firſt, my Lord, he ſaith
that his fact is not comprized within that Statute, ſaith he,
I did never conſpire or imagine the death of the King, nor
did believe that would be a conſequent of their actings. It
was expreſly proved that himſelf did ſay that the King
muſt die, and Monarchy with him, but Gentlemen though
he had ſaid true, that it had not been proved, or that
he did not believe that would be a conſequent, yet my
Lord, I muſt tell you that every ſtep of this Tragedy was
Treaſon, the ſummoning themſelves that was Treaſon,
every proceeding upon that was Treaſon, the ſummoning
of their meetings in the Painted Chamber, coming into
<hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> every perſon as inſtrumental, thoſe that
came to act the leaſt part in that Tragedy were every one
guilty of Treaſon, what ſaith he, I acted as a Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
for my ſee. It was that ſee that <hi>Judas</hi> had the 30. pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of ſilver, that made him hang himſelf. He goes further
and tells you, there muſt be no ſemblable Treaſons, this
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:56280:83"/>
is clear; the conſpiring, and imagining the death of the
King, that's the Treaſon that is mentioned in the Act, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
by the Common Law, though this be not named the
killing of the King, yet all theſe proceedings are demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations
to you, there was a Secret Imagination to kill
him. Then to the Act of <hi>Oblivion</hi> his Argument is, That
becauſe the Act ſaith, that if they had Sentenced, ſigned,
or been Inſtrumental in the death of the <hi>King,</hi> that they
ſhould be excepted, but it is not ſaid, or <hi>otherwiſe Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental:</hi>
that therefore this ſhould refer to ſubſequent, not
precedent Acts, that's a ſtrange Expoſition, take it Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically
it hath the moſt large conſtruction, Inſtrumental,
more large than if they had ſaid, or otherwiſe, for it doth
comprehend every thing; There having been ſo full an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
already, I will be ſhort, I will not meddle with his
civil debts, but with his Political, If a man kill another,
though he doth repent, the Magiſtrate muſt do Juſtice <hi>in
terrorem.</hi> Though he doth repent, (I hope in God he doth
ſo,) The Magiſtrates, your Lordſhips, muſt do Juſtice <hi>in
terrorem,</hi> I deſire that Juſtice may be done upon that man.
He ſaid it was no Treaſon to demand Juſtice againſt the
King, becauſe he did but demand it, I hope he will think it
no unkindneſs in me to deſire judgement againſt him becauſe
it is juſt.</p>

                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Wadham Windham.</speaker>
                  <p>As I underſtand the Priſoner at
the Bar, the chief argument which he ſhelters himſelf under,
was his profeſſion, which gives a blaſt to all of us of the
long robe, I will not mince his arguments, ſaith he, here was
a Court, I was appointed Sollicitor, and ſaith he, for men
to practiſe before thoſe that have not a proper Judicature,
it is not Felony, Murther, or Treaſon, (I would not willingly
mince his Argument) and that I was appointed, and the
words dictated to me, and a Councellor carrying himſelf
within the compaſs of his profeſſion is not anſwerable, but
if he will exceed his bounds, his profeſſion is ſo far from ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
him, that, as it hath been opened, it is very much an
aggravation, it is the duty of a Councellor to give Counſel;
if a man ſhall come to me and ask counſel, and I ſhall counſel
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:56280:84"/>
him to kill a man, am not I acceſſary to that murder? Words
by his argument will not amount to Treaſon; if the fact fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
I am as guilty as if I did the fact: in point of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
it is all one as if I had done that very act. If Mr. <hi>Cook</hi>
did adviſe that Act, or was inſtrumental, he is as much a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
as the man in the Frock that did the Execution; for his
profeſſion, truly my Lord, I do not think that a Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
is always bound to know the patent of him that ſits
as Judge, that will not be his Caſe; here was no ordinary
Warrant of Law to carry on Juſtice: <hi>Grotius</hi> ſaith, in caſe
of neceſſity for carrying on Juſtice, there may be many
things allowed: I pray where did Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> read of ſuch a
Court as a High Court of Juſtice, there was never ſuch
a High Court of Juſtice read of in the Law; then as this
was a mock Court, ſo under good favour it was a mock Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction.
Was there any Law under Heaven to put the
King to death? is it not out of the compaſs of all Courts
whatſoever to do it? and under good favour my Lord, this
is but to ſhelter a mans ſelf under colour of Juſtice to do the
moſt execrable Treaſon in the World; I have no more to
ſay to you.</p>

                  <speaker>Lo. Ch. Bar.</speaker>
                  <p>I would repeat the Evidence and your anſwer,
to you, if you have any thing new, ſpeak to it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cook.</speaker>
                  <p>This is new, it was ſaid by one, that if there had been
no charge there had been no ſentence given in the Caſe, I
ſay that the Indictment or Charge is no part of the Tryal
by the Statute of <hi>Magna Charta:</hi> The Peers of the Land ſhall
be tryed by Peers, but are indicted by the Countrey; I
conceive by what they have ſaid, they do make me cauſal
of the Kings death. It is ſaid in the Indictment there was
a power, I ſay this, I did not aſſume any power, it cannot
be ſaid, if Council be come in to an unlawful power, that
he takes the power, but ſtands with reſpect at the Bar.
At Aſſiſes Judgement paſſes, the Clerk of the Aſſiſes, he
is not inſtrumental in taking away life; for that which
Mr. <hi>Starkey</hi> ſhould ſay, that I ſhould ſay, <hi>The King muſt die, and
Monarchy with him,</hi> I humbly beg that the Jury would take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of what Mr. <hi>Nut.</hi> ſaid, that I told him there was no inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:56280:84"/>
of taking away the Kingslife, and beſides it is but a ſingle
witneſs, I hope there muſt be two witneſſes in point of Law,
to convict a man of High Treaſon.</p>

                  <speaker>Lo. Ch. Baron.</speaker>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> you ſaid right but even now, that
if there was any thing in matter of Law which the Court
knows of, which may be of advantage to you, they are of
Council to you, and ſo they ought to be.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cook.</speaker>

                  <speaker>L. Ch. Bar.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſhall repeat the whole Evidence, and begin
with that firſt, (we are upon our Oaths) the Witneſſes that
are againſt you, I took notice of them, you have had a great
deal of Liberty which you have made uſe of civilly, but Sir,
for the fact, I think it is a great deal more full than as you
have anſwered. Firſt, The firſt witneſs produced againſt you
was Mr. <hi>Nutley</hi> (I ſhall ſpeak only the material parts, that
concern your Charge) He ſwears expreſly, that he ſaw <hi>Price</hi>
a Scrivener writing a Charge in the Court of Wards, that he
ſaw his Charge in your hands; He ſaw afterwards when the
King of bleſſed memory was brought as a Priſoner, that there
you delivered the Charge in, there is more than words, you
delivered that Charge in, that alone is an overt act; then if
ther were nothing elſe in that Caſe, that a man in a paper
ſhould call the King Traytor, Tyrant, Murtherer, and impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
enemy, as there the words are, and he deliver this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and this be read, if this be not an overt act of imagining
and compaſſing the Kings death, I do not know what an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
act is, and he gives further evidence (if I miſtake) take
free liberty to interrupt me.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cook.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, they were not my words, but their words that
commanded me.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lo. Chief Baron.</speaker>
                  <p>This I ſay, that this very thing alone, ſuch
a paper approved by you, delivering this paper to an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
&amp; requiring it may be read: this is an overt act to prove
the imagination of your heart for the Death of the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the reaſon is, if the King ſhould be a Tyrant, a Traytor, &amp;c.
it ſtirs up hatred in the people, and the conſequences of that
hatred is the death of the Prince. The next thing that Mr.
<hi>Nutley</hi> ſaid was this, He ſaid that you demanded poſitively
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:56280:85"/>
Judgement againſt him, againſt the bleſſed King then Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
at the Bar. I remember you ſaid that you did demand
Judgement, but that you did not demand Judgement againſt
the King; take it ſo whether you did, or not, (though you ſhall
find in ſome other Witneſſes that I ſhall repeat, that you ſaid
Judgement againſt the King) the conſequence will be the
ſame; who could you demand Judgement againſt but the King,
he was the Priſoner; becauſe he did demand a further hearing
by the <hi>Parliament,</hi> you urged that his Charge might be taken
<hi>pro Confeſſo,</hi> then it muſt needs be Judgement againſt the K. it
is effectively and implicitely the ſame. He went further, and
that was, that being your friend &amp; acquaintance, &amp; acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
your parts as a Lawyer (which truly I do very much
know my ſelf, and do know this Gentleman to be a man of
very great parts in his profeſſion) he had familiar acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taince
with you, he told you what a baſe buſineſs it was, and
you did your ſelf acknowledge it, ſaid the Priſoner to M. <hi>Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>
himſelf, it is a baſe buſineſs, but they put it upon me. He did
diſcourſe further to him of the Oaths of Allegiance &amp; Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,
which he knew very well, no man better, this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
he very ingenuouſly confeſſed it, ſaying, I confeſs it is ſo,
they put me upon it, I cannot avoid it: but then excuſes it, I
am the ſervant of the people: Afterwards he preſſed the K.
to anſwer poſitively whether guilty or not guilty, the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of the K. to anſwer, what was it in effect, but to haſten
Judgement? and that was to haſten his death, ſo that that is
the ſubſtance of Mr. <hi>Nutley</hi>'s teſtimony, that he preſſed Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Judgement was demanded by the Priſoner now at the
Bar, it is not only demanded but preſſed, and all the current
of the witneſſes at ſeveral days are to this purpoſe, it is true
(that I may repeat the whole for you, and againſt you) that
this Gentleman the Priſoner at the Bar, when Mr. <hi>Nutley</hi> did
urge this to him, ſaid, he hoped they did not intend to take
away the Kings life, I verily believe they do not intend to
take away the Kings life, I hope they do not. But Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi>
it is no excuſe to ſay you hope, or you believe they will not,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> How far it may be in ſuch a crime ſomething in extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
<hi>in foro Coeli,</hi> but not <hi>in foro Civili;</hi> you opened it your
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:56280:85"/>
ſelf, that if a man ſhould go about to take the K. Priſoner,
it is Treaſon; the Law adjudged that to be Treaſon, when
you knew they would condemn him as a Tyrant, Murtherer,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> you muſt eaſily believe what would follow ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,
Truly death, that is no colour of excuſe <hi>in foro
Civili. Farrington</hi> ſwears to the ſame purpoſe, that he ſaw you,
having a Parchment in your hands, delivering it in, &amp; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it might be read as a Charge of the People, you did not
ſpeak, I deliver this in as from thoſe that deliver'd it to me,
that was not in the paper, that you ſaid of your ſelf, My
brethren will tell you all, this is an apparent point of the
imagination of your heart; at that time, he ſwears the ſame
thing, that you did deſire it might be taken <hi>pro Confeſſo.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<hi>Bodurdo</hi> is the third, he ſwears the ſame thing too, that
you exhibited a charge of High Treaſon againſt the Priſoner
then at the Bar, &amp; tells you the ſubſtance of it, he ſaith that all
but the firſt day you demanded Judgement for not pleading
to the Charge, he adds that you complained of the delaies, I
am ſure that was not dictated to you, that could not be
thought that you ſhould deſire Judgement for the Priſoner.
It is very true which you ſay for your ſelf in that, that you
did not demand it firſt, till it was demanded by the Court,
Maſter <hi>Bodurdo</hi> tells you, and ſo it was granted, the firſt day
that <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> onely ſaid it, but afterwards that you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
demanded it; The next was Maſter <hi>Herne,</hi> he ſwears
the ſame words again, that you did in the Name of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
aſſembled in Parliament, and the People of <hi>England,</hi>
exhibit a Charge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe are your own words, if you
did exhibit a Charge againſt the King, to exhibit a Charge of
High Treaſon the very thing followed, If it were ſo, there
was death, ſo certainly there cannot be a greater expreſſion
of the imagination of a mans heart, than that is: it is true,
you asked then a queſtion and that was, whether that, that
you concluded, was not that you deſired them to proceed
according to Juſtice, it is true, the words of the Charge are
ſo, but before you come to concluſion you charge him as a
Traytor, Tyrant, <hi>&amp;c. Communis Hoſtis,</hi> after you had given
that Charge, you demanded Juſtice, thoſe that ſpit in his
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:56280:86"/>
face they demanded Juſtice, every one knew what belonged
to that Juſtice. Then <hi>Baker</hi> he ſwears poſitively that you did
exhibit the Charge in this, manner, he ſaid this, that you ſaid,
you had exhibited a Charge of High Treaſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that
the King ſought delays, there is your inſiſting upon it; he
ſayes further that you ſaid theſe words, that you did deſire
Judgement ſhould be given againſt him, and not ſo much you
as the blood that had been ſhed that cryed for Judgement,
truly whether that was a Judgement that you intended for
acquital that muſt be left to the Jury. You asked (becauſe I
will repeat it in order as my memory will give me leave)
whether there was any other words in the charge, than was
in the Proclamation? Mr. <hi>Cook.</hi> Whether there was any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
words, or no, that differed in the Proclamation, as it
was a great ſin and foul fact in the Proclamation, ſo it was
as foul in the Charge. Maſter <hi>Maſterſon</hi> ſwears the ſame too,
he heard you ſay the ſecond day you had delivered a charge
(the day before) againſt the King, and that he had delayed
his anſwer, you deſired he might plead guilty, or
not guilty; the laſt day, that you did in the names of the
Commons Aſſembled in Parliament, and the people of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
demand Judgement againſt the King, and then another
ſwears thoſe words, Judgement againſt the Priſoner at the
Bar, which was the King. <hi>Burden</hi> ſwears you examined him
as a Witneſs againſt the King, in what place he was with the
King, It ſeems he was in the King's Army, he ſwears you gave
him an Oath, (it is teſtimony fit to be believed) but however,
if you did not give the Oath, by what you ſay your ſelf, you
may be by, and asked him the queſtion. Maſter <hi>Starkey,</hi> he
tells you that during the Tryal, and before the Sentence, that
you, being an old acquaintance of his in <hi>Grayes-Inn,</hi> &amp; ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with him, he ſpake like a friend to you, <hi>I hear you are
up to the ears in this buſineſs,</hi> and <hi>whereas you talk of the people,
there is a thouſand for one againſt it,</hi> that you ſhould tell him
again, <hi>You will ſee ſtrange things, but you muſt wait upon God,</hi>
theſe words of waiting upon God are words of that nature,
people do uſe them now adaies, when they would do ſome
horrid impiety, which hath been the ſin of too many; it is
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:56280:86"/>
but a canting language, that is the beſt term I can give it: you
told him then <hi>He muſt die,</hi> this was before the Sentence (that
is to be obſerved, Gentlemen of the Jury) you ſay you did
not know of the Sentence, you ſaid <hi>He muſt die, and Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
with him;</hi> you muſt here know that ſome of thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that ſate upon him ſaid, the King was a gracious and
wiſe King, and as Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> did ſay, and they were the beſt
words they ſpoke, and I think he thinks ſo in his conſcience,
but in concluſion He muſt die, and Monarchy muſt die with
him; others ſaid, they did not hate King <hi>Charles,</hi> but they
hated Monarchy and Government, but Monarchy was the
thing that they would behead. I think I have done with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
that was given againſt you, the Indictment it ſelf was
read, the Overt acts was the meeting, propounding &amp; conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
about it. It appears he was in the Chamber about the
Charge, that he did propound it, he delivered the Charge, &amp;
it appears withal, that he demanded Judgement, he deſired
the King might anſwer, or that it might be taken <hi>pro con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſo:</hi>
theſe are overt acts to declare the imagination of his
heart. The anſwer of Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> I will repeat it as clearly as
I can, becauſe nothing ſhall go to the extenuating of the fact,
but it ſhall be ſpoken. Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> in your anſwer, your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
that you make, you ſet forth the heads of this Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and you ſet them forth very truly; the heads are the
aggravations of the, Indictment, the Indictment was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing
and imagining the death of the King; you ſaid it was
upon theſe grounds, that you did propound, abet, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
the death of the King, that you with others did aſſume
power and authority to kill the King, &amp; that thereupon a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
unknown in a Frock did accordingly kill the King. You
ſay to the firſt part, if it did not appear that you did adviſe
the death of the King, that you were not guilty: for that Sir,
as I told you before, taking them either complexly or ſingly,
if any of the particulars reached to one of theſe acts, it was
enough, but it reaches to all: you required Judgement againſt
the King as a Traytor, and that with a reaſon, and certainly
death muſt follow: you ſay you were appointed to give your
advice, you had a Proclamation, firſt, for Tryal of the King, you
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:56280:87"/>
had the Order of <hi>Jan.</hi> 10. whereby you were appointed to
give your advice, if it were ſo, it will be no excuſe at all, the
Proclama<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> gives you no warrant at all, he that obeys ſo wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Proclamation, it will not ſave him; it appears you were
privy to this before the Proclamation, if you were not at all,
when ſuch a thing as this, is ſuch a Proclamation and Act, and
ſuch a manner of Tryal, as I believe though you have read
very much, you never heard of ſuch a thing in our Law, or fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Nations. That you thereupon ſhould take upon you to
be of Council againſt the King, it aggravates the fact: other
men may be impudent &amp; ignorant, but you that were a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Lawyer, your being of Council doth aggravate the thing.
You ſay, Secondly, by Law words will not amount to Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
for that I would not have that go for Law by no means,
though it be not your Caſe, for you are not indicted for
words, but words are Treaſon, and Indictments are often for
it, but the difference is this: The Indictment is not for
words, but compaſſing and Imagining the death of the King,
words are evidences of the compaſſing &amp; imagining the Kings
death. It is the greateſt evidence of the imagination of the
heart. Words do not make a Treaſon, that is, if it be by infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
or conſequence, but reductively, but if it be immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
I ſhall ſay to a man, go kill the King by theat which is an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
immediate neceſſary conſequence, to ſay this is not Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
I would not have that go for Law, your Caſe is not for
words, but for delivering a Charge, the ground that you
ſpeak of, words may make a Heretick but not a Traytor, it
was a witty ſaying, but you have no ſufficient authority for
it, theſe are words put in writing: we all know if a man
put his words in writing, if a man ſpeak Treaſonable words,
and put them in writing, they have been ſeveral times ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
Treaſon, and ſo in (my Lord) <hi>Cook's 3. Inſtitutes</hi>
the Caſe of <hi>Williams</hi> of the <hi>Temple,</hi> there was a Book of
Treaſon in his own Study of his making, and he was
indicted for it, words put in writing is an expreſs evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the imagination of the heart, you ſay it was dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to you, but when words are written in a Charge and
your name to it, (which I had almoſt forgotten) that's
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:56280:87"/>
more than words: the Witneſſes ſwear the likeneſs of your
hand, they do but ſwear the likeneſs of your hand, no man
can ſwear more unleſs he was preſent and ſee it, but you
owned the Charge, and there your name is, that beſides
the two Witneſſes there is your own actions to prove it.
When two Witneſſes ſhall ſwear it is like your hand, and you
own that Charge, I muſt leave it to the Jury: you ſay you
did this after command, the words were dictated to you,
the words were <hi>conceptis verbis,</hi> appointed, and ordered by
the Court, but the preſſing was yours, he ſtands upon delays
let it be taken <hi>pro confeſſo,</hi> demanding Judgement, theſe
were your words, another man may dictate a thing but you
are not forced to ſpeak it, you urged it, owned it, you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
not in the name of the Court, but in the name of
all the People of <hi>England,</hi> you ſay further that your demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Juſtice is not within the Statute, as I ſaid before, what
can be the effect of demanding Juſtice, but that the King
ſhould die upon thoſe premiſes; you ſay further that it was
in behoof of the King, as you would urge it, to do the King
a Courteſie in asking the King might have Juſtice, but you
did not name what Juſtice it was, but you did him a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie,
truly the King was but a little beholden to you for that
requeſt, all the world knows what that demanding of Juſtice
was, it was to have the Kings head cut off, you went as far
as you could, it ended with you when you demanded Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
that is as far as you could, you cut off the head. S. <hi>Paul</hi>
when the Witneſſes laid down the clothes at his feet, he ſaid,
I killed <hi>Stephen</hi> the Martyr. You ſay further that in all Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies
the Accuſer, or Witneſs, the Jury, the Judge, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner
are the only perſons, and you are none of theſe,
you are only of Council, if Juſtice was not done, what was
it to you? you ſaid you did not aſſume a power, there was
only Eloquence required in the Councel, it hath been truly
ſaid that this is a great aggravation to be of Councel againſt
the King, you ſaid his Majeſty was then a Priſoner and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
Counſel cannot be heard againſt the King, you undertake
to be Counſel againſt the King in his own perſon and in the
higheſt Crime; if the Council at the Barr in behalf of his
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:56280:88"/>
Client ſhould ſpeak Treaſon, he went beyond his ſphere,
but you did not only ſpeak, but acted Treaſon, you ſaid
you uſed not a diſreſpective word to the King, truly for
that you hear what the witneſſes have ſaid, you preſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, you called it a delay, you termed him not the King,
but the Priſoner at the Bar at every word; you ſay you did
not aſſume an authority, it is an aſſumption of authority, if
you countenance and allow of their authority; you ſay you
do not remember you demanded Judgement againſt the
King, that is fully proved againſt you, you your ſelf asked the
queſtion, whether you did ſay againſt the King, he did not
remember, but others poſitively, that you demanded Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
againſt the King and Priſoner at the Bar, you ſaid
that before Sentence there was not an intention to put the
King to death, to that Mr. <hi>Starkey</hi> ſwears that you expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſaid, the King muſt die, and Monarchy with him, and this
before the ſentence: whereas you ſay this is but one wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
that there is to be in Treaſon two witneſſes, but that
there ſhould be two witneſſes to every particular that is an
Evidence of the fact, that is not Law, if to one particular
that is an Evidence, there be one witneſs, another to another,
here are two witneſſes within the meaning of the Statute,
two witneſſes to the Indictment compaſſing and imagining
the Death of the King, being accompanied with other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
this one witneſs if you believe him, is as good
as twenty witneſſes, becauſe other overt acts are expreſly
proved by ſeveral witneſſes: You ſay next, for the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Charge, in right reaſon, it ought to be counted
for the ſervice of the King: Firſt you do acknowledge, and
truly very ingenuouſly, that in the time of peace to bring
him to the Bar, not being a priſoner, is Treaſon (you ſay
it) according to the Law, and that you delivered the charge
for the accelerating of the Charge, and that it was not done
by you traiterouſly, you ſay the King was a Priſoner before,
and you ſay what hands he was in, in the hands of men
of power and violence, it had been your duty to have delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, not accelerated it, that there might have been ſome
means of prevention of that bloody act that followed; if you
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:56280:88"/>
knew that to be Treaſon to make him a priſoner, Subjects
do not uſe to make Kings Priſoners, but Death follows. You
urge in the next place the Act of Indemnity, and that you
are not excepted, for that, you have made as much of it as
the matter will bear, yet you muſt conſider, Firſt, as a rule
in Law, that where they are general words, when they
come to be explained by the particulars, you ſhall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
them within the general: Mark the very words, they
are theſe, <hi>Provided that this Act, nor any thing therein contained
ſhall extend to pardon, diſcharge, or give any other benefits what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
unto ſuch, and ſuch, (among whom you are named) nor
any of them, nor to thoſe two perſons, or either of them who being
diſguiſed by Frocks, and Vizards, did appear upon the Scaffold
erected before</hi> White-Hall, <hi>upon the thirtieth of</hi> January 1648.
<hi>All which perſons, theſe are the words. Firſt,</hi> It ſhall not extend
to you; then it comes, <hi>All which perſons for their execrable
Treaſon in ſentencing to death, or ſigning the Inſtrument for the
horrid murther, or being Inſtrumental in taking away the Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Life of our late Soveraign Lord</hi> CHARLES <hi>the Firſt of
glorious Memory, are left to be proceeded againſt as Traytors to
His late Majeſtie according to the Laws of</hi> England, <hi>and are out
of this preſent Act wholly excepted, and foreprized.</hi> Firſt, as
I told you before, and as it was very well ſaid by Maſter
<hi>Sollicitor,</hi> admitting the reaſon had been miſtaken, and that
you had not been comprehended in the reaſon, you are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
out of the body, provided it ſhall not extend, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Many times Laws do make recitals, which in themſelves are
ſometimes falſe in point of fact, that which is the Law is
poſitive words, the other words are for the reaſon; Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
all which, that is, Maſter <hi>Cook,</hi> which perſons are
excepted not for doing of it, but for his execrable crimes
in being inſtrumental. It is clear without that, if it were not
ſo, we ſay when a Sentence is, or ſuch a one, or ſuch a one; the
third Or makes all disjunctive: Here are three Or's firſt in
ſentencing to death, or ſigning the Inſtrument, then comes
this, or being inſtrumental in taking away the precious
life of our late Soveraign, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this Or doth clearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the other two, or inſtrumental not only in point of
death, but further, being neither a Sentencer, Signer, or
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:56280:89"/>
being inſtrumental in taking away the Kings life; that is,
being any way inſtrumental. Truly, whether it be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental
to exhibit a Charge againſt him, or complain
of his delayes, to ask Juſtice againſt him in the name of
the people; to do all this, and deſire that the Charge
might be taken <hi>pro Confeſſo,</hi> if this be not inſtrumental, I
know-nothing elſe Sentencing and ſigning: Some ſigned the
Sentence, ſome the inſtrument for death: the next degree
of being Inſtrumental, the higheſt degree of that, is to
accuſe him, to deliver in the Charge againſt him, in the
name of the people, do it again and again, be angry at the
delayes. The next thing is this, that you did not do this
<hi>falſo</hi> or <hi>malitioſe,</hi> but for your Fee, and that though there
might be <hi>avaritia,</hi> there was not <hi>malitia</hi> in it, it was done by
your Profeſſion, you were not Magiſterial in it; you thought
the conſequences that did follow, would not follow. If a man
does but intend to beat a man, and he dye upon it, you
know in Law it is all one: You muſt underſtand, there
is a malice in the Law; If a man beat one in the Streets,
and kill him, though not maliciouſly in him, but it is
ſo in Law. That you deſire to have the benefit of the Kings
Declaration; that you did put in your petition proving
the ſame, that you were a priſoner before, that the
Commons in behalf of themſelves and the people of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
they craved the benefit of it, which was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
excepting ſuch as ſhould be by Parliament excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>td,
and that the King ſhould mention a Free Parliament:
for this, it hath been fully anſwered to you, and clearly
by Mr. <hi>Sollicitor,</hi> that you are not at all concerned in the
Kings Declaration at <hi>Breda.</hi> For firſt, it is nothing in Law,
it binds in honour, and we have given the ſame directions
yeſterday upon the like occaſion, that is, that the Kings
Declaration binds him in honour and in Conſcience, but it
does not bind him in point of Law, unleſs there were a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
granted by the Broad Seal, the thing is cleared to you
what Parliament the King meant by it, they were ſitting at
that time, had acknowledged their dutie and allegiance
to their King, they went <hi>ad ultimum potentiae</hi> for a free and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:56280:89"/>
abſolute Parliament, whilſt the King was abſent, though
the King was away; yet notwithſtanding the King Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
whom he meant, he directed one of thoſe Declarations
to our Speaker of the houſe of Commons, and another to
the Speaker of our Peers, in this caſe it was <hi>loquendum ut
vulgus,</hi> it was owned by him as having the name of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
it was done with great wiſdom and prudence, and
ſo as it could be no otherwiſe, they that were loyal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
acting in the Kings abſence, he conſenting to it, the
King owning that Authority, ſo he was obliged in honour
no further than his own meaning and words, but there is
another Clauſe in the act excludes all theſe perſons. The
next thing is this, you ſay the Statute of 25 <hi>Edward</hi> 3. and
it is very true, you ſay if it be any ſemblable Treaſon, we
were not to judge upon that, unleſs they were the Treaſons
in the Act, and it is moſt true, now you would urge but
this, that this is but a ſemblable Treaſon, but you are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
for the compaſſing and imagining the Death of the
King: if theſe Acts did not tend to the compaſſing and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agining
the Kings death, I know not what does, I am ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
you are convicted in your conſcience. The next thing
(for you have ſaid as much as any man can in ſuch a Cauſe, it
is pity you have not a better) you ſay, though it was a
Tyrannical Court as it is called, but ſuch a Court it was, and
there were Officers you ſay, it had <hi>figuram judicii,</hi> that ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravates
the fact to you, to your profeſſion. There is a
difference between a ſtanding Court, and that which is but
named to be a Court, this was but one of a day or two's
growth before, and you know by whom, by ſome that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be only the Commons, your knowledge can tell
you that there was never an Act made by the Commons aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
in Parliament alone, and you may find it in my
Lord <hi>Cook,</hi> that an Act by the Lords and Commons
alone was naught, as appeared by the Records, Sir <hi>James
Ormond</hi> was attainted of Treaſon, the Act was a private
Act by the King and Commons alone, the Lords were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got,
when the Judges came to try it, it was void, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
in <hi>Henry</hi> the 6. time; you know this was no Court
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:56280:90"/>
at all, you know by a printed Authority, that where a ſettled
Court, a true Court, if that Court meddle with that which
is not in their cognizance, it is purely void, the Miniſter
that obeys them is puniſhable, if it be Treaſonable matter,
it is Treaſon: if murder it is murder: ſo in the Caſe of
Martialſea, and in the Common Pleas, if a man ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
an Appeal of death which is of a criminal nature, and
ought to be in the Kings Bench, if they proceed in it, it is
void; if this Court ſhould condemn the party convicted, &amp;
he be executed, it is murder in the Executioner, the Court
had no power over ſuch things; you ſpeak of a Court. Firſt
it was not a Court: Secondly, no Court whatſoever could
have any power over a King in a coercive way, as to his
perſon. The laſt thing that you have ſaid for your ſelf is this,
that admitting there was nothing to be conſtrued of an Act
or an Order, yet there was a difference, it was an Act <hi>de
facto,</hi> that you urged rightly upon the Statute of 11 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7.
which was denied to ſome, God forbid it ſhould be denied you;
if a man ſerve the King in the War, he ſhall not be puniſhed,
let the fact be what it will. King <hi>Henry</hi> the 7. took care for
him that was King <hi>de facto,</hi> that his Subjects might be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
to follow him, to preſerve them, whatever the
event of the King was: <hi>Mr. Cook</hi> you ſay, to have the equity
of that Act, that here was an authority <hi>de facto,</hi> theſe
perſons had gotten the ſupream power, and therefore what
you did under them you do deſire the equity of that Act;
for that clearly the intent and meaning of that Act is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
you, it was to preſerve the King <hi>de facto,</hi> how much
more to preſerve the King <hi>de jure,</hi> he was owned by theſe
men, and you, as King, you charged him as King, and he
was ſentenced as King. That that King <hi>Henry</hi> the 7. did,
was to take care of the King <hi>de facto</hi> againſt the King <hi>de
jure,</hi> it was for a King and Kingly Government, it was not
for an Antimonarchical Government, you proceeded againſt
your own King and as your King, called him in your charge
<hi>Charles Stewart</hi> King of <hi>England.</hi> I think there is no colour
you ſhould have any benefit of the Letter, or of the equitie
of the Act. They had not all the Authority at that time,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:56280:90"/>
they were a few of the people that did it, they had ſome part
of the Army with them, the Lords were not diſſolved
then when they had adjourned ſome time, they did ſit after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
ſo that all the particulars you alledge, are againſt
you. The laſt thing was this, you ſay, that it having pleaſed
God to reſtore the King, Judgement ſhould be given for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
for terrour to others, that this could not be drawn
into example again, why? becauſe by the bleſſing of God
peace was reſtored, no probability that if your life was ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that it would be drawn again into example, this is the
weakeſt thing you have urged, you muſt know the reaſon:
there are two things, there is the puniſhment and example,
puniſhment goes to the priſoner, but example to the docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of all others; God knows what ſuch things may be
in after ages, if there ſhould be impunity for them, it would
rather make men impudent and confident afterwards: if you
have any more to ſay I will hear you, if not I muſt conclude
to the Jury: You hear the evidence is clear for compaſſing
and imagining the Death of the King, you have heard what
he has ſaid, and what he hath done, he has within, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
Witneſſes againſt the King, that he was by at the
drawing of the charge, where it was drawn, you hear he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
this charge in the name of the Commons aſſembled
in Parliament, and the good people of <hi>England,</hi> and what this
charge is, it is high Treaſon and other high miſdemeanors,
you find that he does complain of delays, dosagain and again
ſpeak of this Charge, deſire it may be taken <hi>pro confeſſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> in the
cloſe of all, it was not ſo much he, as innocent blood, that
demanded Juſtice, this was more than was dictated to him.
You have heard the Witneſſes, he was perſwaded to forbear,
acknowledged the King to be a gracious and wiſe King, The
Oaths alledged againſt him, and you have heard his excuſe, I
have nothing to ſay more, I ſhall be very willing to hear you
further: I have not abſolutely directed the Jury.</p>

I did at that time truly, conſcientiouſly act, and did

look upon it as ſo many men got together without authority
and aſwell thoſe that were inſtrumental, though not ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
or ſigners, and that clauſe in the Act, I confeſs I humbly
make bold to ſay, I have not received ſatisfaction in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
thoſe very words of <hi>not ſo much I, as the innocent blood
cries for juſtice</hi> were dictated to me, there was nothing at all

was an aggravation of the thing, the meeting by that autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
was Treaſon, and in them that acted under them and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
of it, the making of that trayterous pretended Act,
making the Proclamation, ſitting upon it, they were all ſo
many Treaſons: That was the reaſon why that was urged
againſt you, aſſuming upon you the power, that was, you
approving of their power by acting under them, ſo that there
is nothing more to be ſaid.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, you have heard the indictment
was for compaſſing and imagining the death of the King, you
have heard the ſeveral Overt acts repeated, and whether
theſe are guilty of Treaſon to deliver in a charge againſt
the K. ſuch a one as that was in theſe words, as againſt a
Traytor, Tyrant, Murderer, and implacable enemy to the
Commonwealth, in theſe very words, to deſire Judgement
againſt the Priſoner (then the King) at the Bar, angry at
delayes, to deſire that the Charge might be taken <hi>pro
confeſſo,</hi> to have it expreſly, again &amp; again to demand Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:56280:92"/>
ſhall endeavour to prove, That he was a chief Conſpirator
with <hi>Cromwell</hi> at ſerveral times, and in ſeveral places, and
that it was deſigned by them. We ſhall prove that he was
the principal perſon to procure the Souldiery to cry out
Juſtice, Juſtice, or aſſiſt or deſire thoſe for the taking away
the life of the King. He did make uſe of his profeſſion,
wherein he ſhould have been the Miniſter of peace, to make
himſelf a Trumpeter of war, of Treaſon and Sedition in
the Kingdom. He preached many Sermons to the Souldiery
in direct terms for taking away the King, comparing the K.
to <hi>Barabbas;</hi> He was inſtrumental when the Proclamation
for the High Court of Juſtice (as they called it) was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed,
directing where it ſhould be proclaimed, and in
what place. When the King was brought upon the ſtage,
that mock-work, he was the perſon that ſtirred up the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery
below to cry for Juſtice; we ſhall ſhew you as he
preached at ſeveral times upon ſeveral occaſions, ſtill he was
in the Pulpit to promote this buſineſs, the next day after he
was brought to tryal he commends it; you ſhall hear all out

                     <p>My L. and Gentlemen of the Jury, It was near
about (and that the Priſoner may remember) the moneth
of <hi>July</hi> 1648. ſince we came firſt acquainted, when he went
over to <hi>Ireland,</hi> it was about the Siege of <hi>Pembroke</hi> Caſtle,
but afterwards in the year 1649. we renewed our acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
he went over into <hi>Ireland</hi> with that Uſurper the late
Protector, as he was called, after the Town of <hi>Wexford</hi> was
taken; coming over he fell ſick of the flux, and ſaid he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it by infection, praying over Captain <hi>Horton.</hi>
Coming into <hi>Milford,</hi> that Captain ſends a ſummons
to me, to come on board, that was to fetch this priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
at the Bar, who was ſick. I found him there groveling
upon the deck, and ſick he was indeed, with much
difficulty we got him on ſhore, within a very few dayes,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:56280:92"/>
(to the beſt of my remembrance five days) I perfected
his cure. We became very familiar, I obſerved in
him that he had ſome ſecret thoughts that I could not well
diſcover, neither well underſtand, whereupon I thought it
might tend to my ſecurity that I ſhould ſo much ſympathize
with him, to get within him to know his intentions. After
ſome weeks, (for he continued with me ten weeks, or near
thereabouts, ſome few days, rather over than under) we grew
ſo familiar, that at laſt I found he began to inlarge his heart
to me. Many times I ſhould hear him rail moſt inſufferably
againſt the Blood Royal, not only againſt our Martyred King,
but againſt his Royal off-ſpring, ſtill as we continued our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
he became more and more open to me, ſo we
would ſit up diſcourſing (till about twelve or one of the clock
at night, very often) about theſe unhappy wars late in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
At laſt, my Lord, I found him, that he began to tell
me how he came into <hi>England,</hi> and upon what account he
came out of <hi>New England.</hi> I ſhall deſire that in regard his
diſcourſes were various, that I may deliver them orderly, they
were delivered to me within the compaſs of ten weeks, but
the days and weeks I cannot remember. Firſt he told me
(diſcourſing of <hi>New England</hi> and the Clergy there, and much
of the Clergy here in <hi>England,</hi> and of the buſineſs here of
reformation,) he told me that for the driving on of this inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
of this Reformation, he was imployed out of <hi>New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
for the ſtirring up of this war and driving of it on, this
I ſhall my Lord ſpeak to in the firſt place, and that upon the
oath I have taken: and ſecondly, he was pleaſed at another
time to acquaint me, and that by way of complement, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
then againſt the Parliament, ſaying, that ſometime
after he was come into <hi>Engl.</hi> he was ſent over into <hi>Ireland</hi> by
the Parliament to receive further inſtructions to drive on the
deſign, to extirpate Monarchy; ſaith he, I did diſpend a great
deal of my own money, yet never had that ſatisfaction from
them which they promiſed me, that was they promiſed me
2 or 3000 <hi>l.</hi> for my journey, and yet they have given me no
more but only a ſmall pittance of land out of my Lord of
<hi>Worceſters</hi> eſtate in <hi>Worceſter-ſhire.</hi> I have ſeen his letters di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:56280:93"/>
to his kinſman here in <hi>London,</hi> as I take it, his name
was <hi>Parker,</hi> adviſing him for the ſettling of this land and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
it. Thirdly, my Lord, I have obſerved, that by way of
vilification of the Monarchical Government, I have found
him jocundarily ſcoffing at it, and would ordinarily quibble
in this manner, ſaying, this Common-wealth will never be at
peace till 150. be put down. I asked him what this 150. was,
he told me three L's, and afterwards interpreted the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be the Lords, the Levites and the Lawyers, with that
ſaid I, we ſhall be like <hi>Switzers, Tinkers</hi> and <hi>Traytors.</hi> Now
my Lord, we are come to the laſt particular, we diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
thus frequently, and withal he was then a Colonel,
and had a Commiſſion under that Uſurper <hi>Oliver,</hi> and
brought over his Commiſſion for raiſing of Souldiers to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that War in <hi>Ireland;</hi> that it was ſo I appeal to the
dictates of his own Conſcience, and whether he did not preſs
me very importunately to accept of a Commiſſion of Major
or a Captain; he did iſſue forth two Commiſſions under his
own hand, one of them to bring over from <hi>Devon-ſhire</hi> two
foot Companies unto <hi>Cork.</hi> My Lord, becauſe we were mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarily
affected, amongſt the diſcourſes of our unhappy
wars, I know not how it came from him, it being near ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
years ſince, and I have had many ſufferings incumbent on
me, ſo that I may fail in ſome particulars, but in general
thus it was: we were diſcourſing concerning our Martyr'd
King, as then we call'd him, and of his Impriſonment in
<hi>Holmeby</hi>-Houſe, which I wondered at, thus we diſcourſt, he
told me the ſtory how they had uſed him at <hi>Holmeby,</hi> and at
laſt came up to this, when he was taken away from <hi>Holmeby.</hi>
Houſe, the Parliament had then a deſign to have ſecured
<hi>O. Cromwel,</hi> and my ſelf being then in <hi>London,</hi> ſaith he, we
having intelligence of it, eſcaped out of <hi>London,</hi> and
rode hard for it, and as we rode to <hi>Ware</hi> we made a halt,
and adviſed how we ſhould ſettle this Kingdome in peace,
and diſpoſe of the King, the reſult was this; They ſhould
bring him to juſtice, Try him for his life, and cut off his
Head: whether this was the expreſſion of <hi>Cromwel</hi> I cannot
tell; but to the utmoſt of my remembrance, and I am miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
if it was not the advice of Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> to <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and I
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:56280:93"/>
believe it, becauſe his former relations of his inſtructions
out of <hi>Ireland</hi> did tend to that effect.</p>

                     <p>My Lord, I deſire to ſpeak a Word, <hi>(his voice being
ſo low he was brought to the ſecond Bar.)</hi> I am the bolder to
ſpeak to your Lordſhips at this time a word, and it is high time to
ſatisfie my conſcience, if theſe things were true, there is enough
ſaid to deſtroy me, I deſire leave to tell you what offence I take at
the witneſs, thus my Lord. This Gentleman I do know—</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Coun.</speaker>
                     <p>What ſay you to him?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Peters.</speaker>
                     <p>That which I have to ſay is this, that in his ſtory he hath
told that which is not true, but I will not find fault with him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he was my hoſt, I will not reflect and recriminate, I ſhall
give your Lordſhips in ſimplicity as much ſatisfaction my ſelf as
any witneſs, this I ſay to the man that ſpeaks, and this is certain,
I did indeed ſpend ſome time at this Gentlemans houſe, he is called
there Dr. <hi>Young,</hi> and my trouble at this diſcourſe is this, I do not
know my Lord that I found a more violent man for the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
than himſelf; ſo far, he undertook to be a ſpy on one ſide,
this I find to be ſo, he will not deny it, he was very fierce in that
way, I think words of ſuch a man ought to be little attended to.
The ſecond is this, this Gentleman is not a competent witneſs,
and that upon a two-fold ground. Firſt, becauſe I know he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a very great temptation and trouble in this very thing, and it
is upon this account, he was put out of his living in the Countrey,
and here he came to me to help him again, and was very highly
offended becauſe I did not do it. Secondly, it is not that I would
invalidate his witneſs, but give me leave to tell you, it is his way
to ſnap and catch at every man, which is the complaint of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in his own countrey. I know that ſame which is ſpoken is falſe, I
ſpeak it in the preſence of God, I profeſs I never had any near con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
with <hi>O. C.</hi> about ſuch things, I ſpeak this to the Jury, that they
would have a care of the witneſs, I was in ſickneſs then, thoſe that have
known me, do know likewiſe I have much weakneſs in my head when
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:56280:94"/>
I am ſick, and to take words that are ſpoken in a ſick condition he
ought not to do it, for the words themſelves I do here profeſs againſt
them, for the generality of them, and that he hath been freer in
my judgement in any communication this way than I have been; it
is marvellous, here I profeſs the things untruths, I call God and
Angels to witneſs they are not true. I will give you an account of my
whole condition by and by, if I may be heard.</p>

                     <p>You ſhall be heard at large, that which you have
been heard now, is concerning the competency or incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency
of the witneſs: the incompetency againſt him is this,
that when you came thither none more violent for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
than himſelf, and that he was a great ſpie, and you
ſay it is uſual with him to take ſuch courſes; theſe are but
words, if you have any witneſſes we will hear them, the man
may be traduced and ſlandered, and ſo all witneſſes may be
taken away.</p>

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> if you take this courſe God knows when
this buſineſs will end, if you have a mind take pen, ink and
paper, and take notes of the witneſſes, and make exceptions
to them one after another. But interrupting one and ſo ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
we ſhall never have done.</p>

                     <p>I do recollect my ſelf of ſome other conferences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us, as to my being malicious, I know he never did me
any wrong, and therefore I cannot be malicious, and as for
my reputation, having reſided two years in <hi>London,</hi> I can
have certificates both from my Countrey, and ſome of this
City to vindicate me in that particular. But my Lord, that
which I would inform your Lordſhip is this, he told me he
took Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> a priſoner himſelf in his own Chamber,
ſeized on his goods, and took his George and Blue ribband
off his ſhoulder, and this George he ſhewed me.</p>

<hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> and ſeveral of that party did uſe to meet in
conſultation: They had ſeveral meetings, I do remember
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:56280:94"/>
very well one among the reſt, in particular, that Mr. <hi>Peters</hi>
was there, he came in, in the afternoon about four a clock,
and was there till ten or eleven at night, I being but a Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
could not hear much of the diſcourſe, but the ſubject was
tending towards the King after he was a priſoner, for they
called him by the name of <hi>Charles Stuart:</hi> I heard not much
of the diſcourſe, they were writing, but what I know
not: but I gueſſed it to be ſomething drawn up againſt the
King, I perceived that Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> was privy to it, and
pleaſant in the company.</p>

                     <p>My Lords, in the month of <hi>December</hi> before the
King died, in the beginning of that month, and ſo towards
the 12. of <hi>January</hi> following, the head quarters of the Army
were at <hi>Windſor,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ireton</hi> that is dead (who was a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Officer of the Army was quartered in my fathers houſe
there; and by reaſon of his long reſidence there, being about
two months (his wife was there too) My Lords, this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> he likewiſe quartered in another place in
that town, and <hi>Cromwel</hi> himſelf was quartered at one Mr.
<hi>Bakers</hi> that lay low in the town, ſo that in truth, my fathers
houſe being near the Caſtle, and there being in it a large
room, and in reſpect that Mr. <hi>Ireton</hi> was quarter'd there,
uſually the Council of War ſate there: My Lords, I was
then in the houſe conſtantly, beſides this Council of War
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:56280:95"/>
which did commonly ſit there, I did obſerve that <hi>Cromwel,
Ireton,</hi> and this Gentleman Mr. <hi>Peters,</hi> and one Col. <hi>Rich,</hi> and
a fifth perſon whoſe name I have forgot, did uſually meet and
conſult together, and would ſit up till two or three of clock
in the morning very privately together, this was their uſual
courſe when their Council of War ſate, Mr. <hi>Ireton</hi> came in to
ſupper, but went out again. There were guards upon them.
After this time it happened ſo, that I was often in Mr. <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s
company, where Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> coming to him was very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
at meals there, but eſpecially at nights, by occaſion of that.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Ireton</hi> being civil in carriage, would uſually entertain
diſcourſes with Mr. <hi>Peters,</hi> likewiſe would favour me ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with diſcourſe; and in that diſcourſe, I did many
times take occaſion to aſſert the laws in point of the King:
And diſcourſing about the King as being a capital inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the late Inconveniences, as they call'd it, in the
times of the war, Mr. <hi>Ireton</hi> would diſcourſe this ordinarily:
I was bold to tell them, that the perſon of the K. was <hi>ſolutus
legibus,</hi> this Gentleman, the Priſoner at the Bar, told me, It was
an unequal law. I did obſerve Mr. <hi>Peters,</hi> that he did bend
his diſcourſe not by way of argument only, but in point of
reſolution of judgement fully againſt the Perſon and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the King. I remember ſome of his expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were theſe, That he was a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> that he was a <hi>Fool,</hi>
that he was <hi>not fit to be a K.</hi> or bear that <hi>office;</hi> I have heard him
ſay, that for the Office it ſelf (in thoſe very words which ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after came into Print) that it was a <hi>dangerous, chargeable</hi>
and <hi>uſeleſs</hi> Office. My Lords, the conſtant diſcourſe of this
Gentleman at that time was ſuch as he did believe would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be called into queſtion, ſo that it was not a thing that a
man was neceſſitated to obſerve by an accident, but it was
their full and whole diſcourſe. I will put you in mind of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
paſſage, When the news came to <hi>Windſor,</hi> that the
King was in Priſon at the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> my father whoſe houſe
that was, was very much troubled at it; and being an ancient
man, was not able to controll his paſſions with reaſon, told
my mother, that they (meaning Mr. <hi>Ireton,</hi> &amp;c.) ſhould
have no entertainment there, and took the key of the Celler
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:56280:95"/>
and put it in his pocket; his paſſions being leſſened, Mr.
<hi>Ireton,</hi> his wife and another Officer being at ſupper, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
my father ſaid Grace, and as he uſually did, though
they were there, he ſaid that uſual and honeſt expreſſion,
praying for the King in theſe uſual words, God ſave the
King, Prince, and Realm; ſometimes they did laugh at it,
but never did reflect upon him, but this night he made this
expreſſion, God ſave the Kings moſt excellent Majeſty and
preſerve him out of the hands of all his enemies: <hi>Peters</hi>
who was then at the Table, turns about to him and ſaid, Old
Gentleman, your <hi>Idol</hi> will not ſtand long: I do conceive
he meant it of the King. For a matter of two months of the
conſtant reſidence and being of the Army there, I did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
that in the general Council there, and in this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Cabal (after the buſineſs was broke out, and when
the King was taken priſoner and carried to <hi>Windſor)</hi> Mr. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
was the conſtant man: and when the buſineſs broke
out, I looke upon it in reaſon that <hi>Cromwel, Ireton,</hi> and
this Gentleman at the Bar, and <hi>Rich,</hi> and that other
Gentleman whoſe name I have forgot, that they were
the perſons that did the buſineſs. My Lords, Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> he
continued at <hi>Windſor,</hi> I remember very well, that after the
body of the Army, the General and the Officers of the Army
were gone to <hi>London,</hi> he continued in <hi>Windſor:</hi> I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
a paſſage of one <hi>Bacon</hi> who was a Sectary, Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> being
in diſcourſe of the King, Mr. <hi>Bacon</hi> took great diſtaſte at
Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> for ſome affront put on the K. Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> falls upon
him and rails at him, and was ready to beat him: we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood

                     <p>I came out of <hi>Eſſex</hi> in at <hi>Aldgate,</hi> juſt as I came
in, a Proclamation was read for Tryal of his late Majeſty,
I went down the next day to the Painted Chamber at
<hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where I ſaw <hi>Oliver Cromwel, John Goodwin</hi> and
<hi>Peters</hi> and others; <hi>John Goodwin</hi> ſate in the middle of the
Table, and he made a long ſpeech or prayer, I know not
whether, but <hi>Mr. Peters</hi> ſtood there: after <hi>John Goodwin</hi>
had done his prayer, it was deſired that ſtrangers might
avoid the room (then came up <hi>Cook,</hi> and <hi>Doriſlaus,</hi> and
<hi>Humphreys,</hi> and <hi>Ask,</hi> and <hi>Dendy,</hi> and ſeveral others, and
ſtood by <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> at the upper end of the Table) But
<hi>Cromwel</hi> ſtood up and told them it was not neceſſary that
the people ſhould go out, but that was overruled, and ſo I
went out and ſtayed their riſing, and ſaw this Gentleman
Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> come out with them. After that, when the
King was brought to Town a priſoner, the Lord <hi>Carew,</hi> a
very honourable perſon, meeting with me, ſaith he, <hi>Walkely,</hi>
if you will ſee your old Maſter, go now, or elſe it may be
you will never ſee him. Where is he my Lord? ſaid I,
ſaith he, he is coming on this ſide <hi>Brainford.</hi> I went to the
farther end of <hi>St. James</hi> Corner, and there I met ſome of the
Army coming, and then I ſaw his Majeſty in his Coach with
ſix horſes, and <hi>Peters</hi> like Biſhop <hi>Almoner</hi> riding before the
King triumphing, then after that, in <hi>St. James Park,</hi> I
ſaw <hi>Peters</hi> marſhalling the Souldiers, and I was forced to
go about. My Lord, this is all I can ſay concerning
that, I remember one thing further of him, I heard
him in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi> ſay, within a year or two after the
Army was raiſed, <hi>If we can keep up our Army but ſeven years
longer, we need not care for the King and all his poſterity.</hi>

there was a ſolemn Faſt appointed to ſeek God in

preach before them.</p>

                     <p>My Lord, and you, Gentlemen
of the Jury, upon a day that was appointed for a Faſt for
thoſe that ſate then as a Parliament, I went to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to
find out ſome company to dine with me, and having walked
bout an hour in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-Hall, and finding none of my
friends to dine with me, I went to that place called Heaven
and dined there; after I had dined, I paſſed through St. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garets</hi>
Church-yard to go home again, (I lay in the <hi>Strand,)</hi>
I perceived all the Church-yard full of Muskets and Pikes
upon the ground, and asked ſome Souldiers that were there,
what was the buſineſs? they told me they were guarding the
Parliament that were keeping a Faſt at St. <hi>Margarets;</hi> who
preaches ſaid I? they told me Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> is juſt now gone up
into the Pulpit, ſaid I, I muſt needs have the curioſity to
hear that man, having heard many ſtories of the manner
of his preaching, (God knows I did not do it out of any
manner of devotion) I crouded near the Pulpit, and came
near the Speakers Pew, and I ſaw a great many of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
there, whom I knew well: I could not gueſs what his
Text might be, but hearing him talk much of <hi>Barabbas</hi> and
our Saviour, and inſiſting altogether upon that, I gueſſed
his Text was that paſſage, wherein the <hi>Jews</hi> did deſire the
releaſe of <hi>Barabbas</hi> and crucifying of Chriſt; and ſo it prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the firſt thing I heard him ſay was, <hi>it is a very ſad thing
that this ſhould be a queſtion amongſt us, as among the old</hi> Jews,
<hi>whether our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt muſt be crucified or that</hi> Barabbas
<hi>ſhould be releaſed, the oppreſſor of the people: O Jeſus,</hi> ſaid he,
<hi>where are we, that that ſhould be a queſtion amongſt us?</hi> ſaies
he, <hi>And becauſe that you ſhould think my Lords and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
that it is a queſtion, I will tell you it is a queſtion;
I have been in the City, which may very well be compared
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:56280:99"/>
to</hi> Hieruſalem <hi>in this conjuncture of time, and I profeſs thoſe
fooliſh Citizens for a little trading, and profit, they will have</hi>
Chriſt (pointing to the <hi>Redcoats</hi> on the Pulpit ſtairs) <hi>cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and that great</hi> Barabbas <hi>at</hi> Windſor <hi>releaſed,</hi> ſayes he,
<hi>but I do not much heed what the rabble ſayes: I hope,</hi> ſayes he,
<hi>that my brethren of the Clergy will be wiſer, the lips of the Prieſts
do uſe to preſerve knowledge, I have been with them too in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,
and having ſeen and heard what they ſaid, I perceive
they are for crucifying of Chriſt and releaſing of</hi> Barabbas, <hi>O
Jeſus, what ſhall we do now?</hi> with ſuch like ſtrange expreſſions,
and ſhrugging of his ſhoulders in the Pulpit.</p>

before <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> and <hi>Bradſhaw,</hi> who was called Lord
Preſident of the High Court of Juſtice, and he took his Text
out of the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> in theſe words, <hi>Bind your Kings with chains,
and your Nobles in fetters of iron;</hi> that was part of the Text:
But ſayes he in his Sermon, Beloved, it is the laſt Pſalm but
one, and the next Pſalm hath ſix verſes, and twelve Hallelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jahs,
praiſe ye the Lord, Praiſe God in his Sanctuary, and ſo
on; for what ſaies he? look into my Text, there is the
reaſon of it, That Kings were bound in chains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He went
on with a ſtory of Major and a Biſhop and his man, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
man, ſaith he, being drunk, the Major laid him by the
heels, the Biſhop ſends to the Major, to know by what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
he impriſoned his ſervant, the Majors anſwer was,
there is an Act of Parliament for it, and neither the Biſhop
nor his man are excepted out of it: and applyed it thus,
Here is ſaith he, a great diſcourſe and talk in the world,
what? will ye cut off the Kings head, the head of a Proteſtant.
Prince and King? turn to your Bibles and you ſhall find it
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:56280:100"/>
there, <hi>Whoſoever ſheds mans blood, by man ſhall his blood be ſhed,</hi>
ſaies he, I will even anſwer them as the Major did the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
here is an Act of God, Whoſoever ſheds mans blood,

this Gentleman preached, and he preached upon this Text,
<hi>149. Pſalm v.</hi> 8. To bind their Kings in chains, and their

ſentence of the King, I heard <hi>Peters</hi> preach upon this Text
in S. <hi>James's</hi> Chapel, 149. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 6, 7, 8. 9, verſes. <hi>Let the

<hi>in their hands,</hi> to execute vengeance upon the heathen, and
puniſhment <hi>upon the people,</hi> To bind their Kings with chains,

the judgement written, this honour</hi> have all his Saints, praiſe ye

reprobate the poor Kings friends. And in the middle of
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:56280:100"/>
his Sermon he took occaſion to produce a Text 14. Eſay 18,
19, 20. <hi>All the Kings of the Nations even all of them lie

him a few daies before the King was murthered, preach in
S. <hi>Sepulchers</hi> Church, there he compares the King that was
then to dye to <hi>Barabbas</hi> a murderer, and in this manner,
ſaith he, There is a great company amongſt us, like the Jews,
they cry out, Let <hi>Chriſt</hi> be crucified, and let <hi>Barabbas</hi> be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed,
ſtill comparing the King to <hi>Barabbas</hi> the murtherer,
theſe were his words, with many more to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>

and preached theſe twenty years, and now I may ſay
with old <hi>Symeon, Lord now letteſt thou thy ſervant depart in
peace, for mine eyes have ſeen thy ſalvation.</hi> Afterwards he
ſpeaks of the Text, of <hi>binding their Kings in chains, &amp;c.</hi>
then much reviled the <hi>King:</hi> but ſoft there, ſaith he, I muſt
not talk ſo here, I am in the <hi>Kings</hi> Chapel: there is a very
remarkable paſſage in <hi>Amos, Amos</hi> went to preach, and
<hi>Amazia</hi> would not let him; but <hi>Amos</hi> would preach, the

he ſpeaks of the <hi>Major</hi> of <hi>Exeter</hi> that commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Biſhops ſervant for being drunk, ſaith the Major, here
is an Act of Parliament for it, and I do not ſee that the Biſhop

                     <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhips, I will give you an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the buſineſs, I lived fourteen years out of <hi>England,</hi>
when I came over I found the wars begun, I began no war,
my Lord, nor have been the Trumpeter, when I came out of the
Weſt Indies, I fled from the War into <hi>Ireland,</hi> to the Weſtern
part there, and it was after the Rebellion, when ſome of the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> had been ſtirring there, I went and ſpent my time
there. I was neither at <hi>Edge-hill</hi> nor <hi>Naſeby,</hi> but my
Lord, after I came over there was War that the people were
engaged in, I was not here in the beginning of it, but was a
ſtranger to the carriage of it. When I came into the Nations,
I looked after three things, one was, that there might be ſound
Religion. The ſecond was, that learning and Laws might be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.
The third, that the poor might be cared for, and I muſt
confeſs I have ſpent moſt of my time in theſe things, to this end and
purpoſe; there was a noiſe in all parts of ſome miſcarriages in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:56280:102"/>
of Religion, after it was ſetled I lived in <hi>Ireland,</hi> I muſt
profeſs for my own part ſolemnly that my carriage hath been up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
theſe heads. For Religion I have, through Gods mercies,
ſpoke the truths of the Proteſtant Church, upon this account I did
ſtay to ſee what God might do, I was ſent over to his Majeſty that
we might have a little help in point of Exciſe and Cuſtomes, and
encouragement in learning. My Lord, this is true, that I being
here in the Nation, and being ſent over upon the occaſions
of the Countrey, and not upon any deſign, but this I ſay, (I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
deny it) that after I came over, and had ſeen the ſtate of
<hi>England,</hi> in ſome meaſure I did ſtir, but by ſtrong importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
the Miniſters of <hi>London</hi> deeper than I: I am very ſorry to
hear of my carriage towards the King, it is my great trouble, I
beg pardon for my own folly and weakneſs, I thought God had
a great controverſie with the Nation, and the Lord was diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
on all hands, that which ſome people took to, I did take unto,
I went into the Army, I ſaw at the beginning of it, that corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
grew among them, I ſuppoſe none can ſay I have gone aſide
from any Orthodox truth of the Lord: And now to take off the
ſcandal upon me, and to the buſineſs, let me beg of your Lordſhips
to conſider whatever prejudices or revenge may take up mens
hearts, there is a God that knows all, God hath a regard to the
people of <hi>England.</hi> I look upon this Nation as the Cabinet of the
world. That that doth concern the buſineſs is this, my Lord, that
after this time hither I came, and did bear witneſs to all the world
that there was amongſt us ſomething that was for better, and ſome
thing worſe for the Nation, I took advice of ſome great perſons
concerning the weightineſs of it, I had neither malice nor miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
in my heart againſt the King, upon this I did engage
ſo far as being invited, I went into the Wars, and there
I found very ſtrange and ſeveral kinds of providences, as
this day hath been ſeen; I do not deny but that was active,
but not to ſtir in a way that was not honourable. I
challenge a great part of the Nations to manifeſt my carriage
among them, I ſhall make it good divers ways, I had ſo much reſpect
to his Majeſty particularly at <hi>Windſor,</hi> that I propounded to his
Majeſty my thoughts three ways to preſerve himſelf from danger,
which were good as he was pleaſed to think, though they did not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56280:103"/>
and the work died; as for malice, I had none in me. It is true,
there was a difference amongſt us, an Army, and an Army, I never
had a groat or penny from <hi>O. Cromwel</hi> ſince I knew this place, I
profeſs I have had no ends for honour or gain, ſince <hi>I</hi> ſet foot upon
this ſhore, I challenge any man that belonged to that party, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they had not the ſame reſpect from me as my own party, I
have not perſecuted any with malice, I will only take off
malice.</p>

                     <p>I am unskilful in Law, this that I offer, is to ſhew
that I had no malice in me, I was ſo far from malice, that I
have a Certificate, if worth the reading, from one of the Eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
perſons in the Nation, to ſhew I had no malice. It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

                     <p>I am not willing at all to interrupt you, or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
you, that which you ſpeak of doing good ſervices is not

                     <speaker>Lord Ch. Baron.</speaker>
                     <p>Then I will remember you, you are
charged by this Indictment for compaſſing and imagining
the death of the <hi>King,</hi> and there is ſet forth ſundry
particulars to prove the overt act, that you with
other perſons named in that Indictment, did conſult and
meet together, how to bring about the <hi>Kings</hi> death. Then
you are charged with ſeveral Acts of contriving and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
the <hi>Kings</hi> death. Overt acts that tend to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing
or imagining the <hi>Kings</hi> death, or any one of theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to
encourage the bringing on the <hi>King</hi> to his death, the conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or meeting together about it, though you did not ſit or
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56280:103"/>
ſentence; yet if you did any thing tending to that incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,
or otherwiſe abet it, comfort or any wiſe ayd
thoſe trayterous perſons that did it; in the doing of it you
are by law guilty of the whole fact: the propoſing and
determining the King ſhall die, though you were not he
that actually put him to death, yet notwithſtanding, if you
did the other, you are guilty of all; if you ſhall ſpeak any ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious
ſpeeches, be they in the Pulpit or out of the Pulpit,
if you ſhall utter any thing that tends to ſedition, theſe are
open acts, which prove the imagination of the heart, though
imagination of the heart be Treaſon, yet it cannot be proved
but by open acts, yet the imagination it ſelf is Treaſon; firſt
you did conſpire, all the witneſſes go along to prove this.
Dr. <hi>Young</hi> ſaith, you came over from <hi>Ireland</hi> to his houſe,
and after five days that you were recovered of the Flux, you
ſtaid there ten weeks, you ſaid your ſelf, there was enough
if it were true, to condemn you or any man: I ſhall repeat
it to you, you told him a narrative, that you came from
<hi>New England,</hi> from thence to <hi>Ireland,</hi> and then you came
to <hi>Holland</hi> with an intent to ſee how you might bring on the
Kingdom to be a Commonwealth: next he ſaith, you ſpake
very often againſt the King by way of diſgrace againſt him
and his family, againſt the King and his off-ſpring, this
you ſaid very often: then you ſpake in vilification of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical
Government, that this Commonwealth would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be at peace till 150. or three L's, Lords, Levites, and
Lawyers were taken away, at which he replyed, then they
muſt be all Switzers, Tinkers or Traytors; he ſwears you
were a Colonel, and had a Commiſſion; that you would
have had him accept of a Commiſſion, and that you had two
Companies come from the Weſt, you told him the Parliament
had an intent to ſecure <hi>Cromwel</hi> and your ſelf, but that you
rid hard for it, and then you confeſſed you agreed then upon
his death, to bring him to tryal, and to cut off his head; you
did agree together, and he believes it was your advice to
<hi>Cromwel;</hi> your anſwer was this, that he was more violent
than your ſelf, that he took upon him to be a ſpie, and that
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:56280:104"/>
he was no competent witneſs, becauſe he was under a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation,
becauſe you did not help him to his living, and ſo
conceived it to be malice; you ſay, he was uſed to take up
ſuch courſes in his own Country, the matter is not whether
you had malice to the Kings life or Monarchy. For the next,
one <hi>Gunter,</hi> he ſwears, that he was a Servant to Mr. <hi>Hildeſly,</hi>
at the Star in <hi>Coleman-ſtreet,</hi> and this was in 1648. he ſaith,
that many of the party of <hi>Cromwel</hi> did uſe to reſort thither,
among the reſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he ſaw you, he ſaid he came in to them, and
their diſcourſe was about <hi>Charles Stewart,</hi> and the Priſoner—
and did gueſs it was about the King, that you were privy
to it then; he ſaih this was three daies before <hi>O. Cromwel</hi>
went out of Town, the effect of that is urged no further than
this, that you were ſo far of the Cabal, that you were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
with thoſe perſons, <hi>Cromwel, Ireton, Rich,</hi> and others;
you ſaid, I was there once with Mr. <hi>Nathaniel Fines: Starkey</hi>
he ſaith, that at his Fathers houſe <hi>Ireton</hi> lay, and was quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
there at <hi>Windſor,</hi> before and when the King was Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
that you had your quarter there, and <hi>Cromwel</hi> too in
that Town: The general meeting of the Councel of War
was at his Fathers houſe, there <hi>Ireton</hi> and his Wife lying
there, you came and reſorted thither very often; he ſaith
then, that it appeared that after the Councel of War had
done, many times <hi>Rich,</hi> and you, and <hi>Cromwel</hi> and <hi>Ireton,</hi>
were there together, ſometimes till two a clock in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
he ſaith then, that he did obſerve there was a fifth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
(he did not remember his name) &amp; you ſate up uſually till
two or three in the morning, you had guards about you; he
ſaith further, that <hi>Ireton</hi> being a Domeſtick, he often diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed
with him, and you came ſometimes to be there too,
that there being ſome diſcourſe concerning the King many
times he did aſſert the Law concerning him, that he was <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutus
legibus</hi> as to his perſon; that you ſhould ſay, that it was
an unequal law, and that you did then diſcourſe fully againſt
the K. Government: you ſaid he was a Tyrant and not fit for
that office, that the office was uſeleſs, chargeable and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous;
theſe very words he obſerved, which afterwards
were printed, when they took away Monarchy. He ſaith
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:56280:104"/>
further, that was their full and whole diſcourſe; he
ſaith, that his Father at Supper uſed to ſay that uſual
Grace, <hi>God ſave the King, Prince and Realm,</hi> but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
that he heard the King was made a Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that his Father altering the Grace, he ſaid, <hi>God
ſave his moſt Excellent Majeſty, and deliver him out of all
his Enemies hands,</hi> you roſe up, and ſaid, old Gentleman
your Idol will not ſtand long. That he did obſerve you
often with them; he ſaith further, when <hi>Bacon</hi> was coming
out, and ſpeaking ſome words concerning your frequent
affronting the King, you took up a ſtaff and were ready
to beat him, and made an uproar: it appears alſo of
your being privy to <hi>Cromwels</hi> actions; the next witneſs
is <hi>Walkeley,</hi> and he ſwears this againſt you, that he was
in the Painted Chamber the next day after the Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was made, and there he ſaw <hi>John Goodwin</hi> and You,
and there was an aſſembly, and at the middle of the Table
<hi>John Goodwin</hi> was, and made a long ſpeech or prayer, that
<hi>Cromwel</hi> would have had the people ſtay there, but it was
ordered they ſhould be turned out, at the end he ſaw you
come out with the reſt; there it appeared you were in the
conſultation; he ſaith, he met the Army at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, and
there, when they were half paſt, he ſaw the King in his
Coach, and there he ſaw Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> like Biſhop <hi>Almoner</hi> ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
immediately before the King; and at St. <hi>James</hi>'s Park
he ſaw you marſhalling the Souldiers, that he was forced
thereupon to go about; he ſaith further, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a year or two after the Army was raiſed, he heard
you ſay theſe words, If we can keep up our Army ſeven
years longer, we need not care for the King and all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Peters.</speaker>
                     <p>My Lord, I muſt deny abundance of this, the King
commanded me to ride before him, that the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi>
might come to him.</p>

                     <p>But this was three weeks after—The next
witneſs againſt you is one <hi>Proctor,</hi> he ſaith, that day (as
the other witneſs did) he ſaw you riding juſt before the Kings
Coach, and becauſe he did his duty the Souldiers threw
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:56280:105"/>
him horſe and all into a ditch. The next witneſs is one <hi>Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi>
he ſaith, that when the Proclamation was read, he
ſaw you in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-Hall, and that you ſaid, they had
done as good as nothing, unleſs it was proclaimed in <hi>Cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,</hi>
and at the old Exchange, this you ſaid to ſome of the
Officers there.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Peters.</speaker>
                     <p>My Lord, I cannot acknowledge it.</p>

                     <speaker>L. Ch. Bar.</speaker>
                     <p>The next witneſs againſt you is <hi>Simſon,</hi> he
ſwears he ſaw you in conſultation with <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> and
take Sir <hi>William Brereton</hi> by the hand, and come to <hi>Bradſhaws,</hi>
and this during the time of the Kings Tryal, he ſaith further,
that one day when the King was at his Tryal you command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Colonel <hi>Stubbers</hi> to bid his Souldiers cry out, <hi>Juſtice, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,</hi>
which they cryed, and afterwards ſome of the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
ſpit upon the King.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Peters.</speaker>
                     <p>I do believe that he that ſwore that, cannot ſay I was
there.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. Ch. Bar.</speaker>
                     <p>Another witneſs is one <hi>Richardſon,</hi> who ſaw
you the firſt day in the Court; and he ſaid further, that you
commended <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> and another, to wit, <hi>Cook,</hi> for their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
in the tryal of the King. That you held up your hands,
and ſaid, this is a moſt glorious beginning of the work.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Peters.</speaker>
                     <p>Whereabouts in the Court?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Richardſ.</speaker>
                     <p>In the body of the Court, called then the High

                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Peters.</speaker>
                     <p>My Lord, I do not know that ever I was in the body of
the Court.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. Ch. Bar.</speaker>
                     <p>The next witneſs is Sir <hi>Jeremy Whitchcot,</hi> he
ſaith, he heard you often ſpeak ſcurrilouſly of the King, and
making a Narrative of <hi>Cromwels</hi> eſcape, you ſaid there was
a meeting, and <hi>there we reſolved to ſet aſide the King;</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
what the other witneſs ſaid; we agreed, and here we
reſolved: you ſaid, I cannot but reverence the High
Court of Juſtice, it doth reſemble the judging of the world
at the laſt day by the Saints, ſo it was the Saints that ſate
there: I would have preached before the wretch, but the
poor wretch would not hear me: you often call'd him Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
I cannot poſſibly remember the place, things or words
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:56280:105"/>
that are alledged. Then you have another witneſs <hi>Nonnelly,</hi>
he ſaith, he came with a warrant to <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> for ſome
money, and that he ſhould ſay, go and ſee the beheading of
the King at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> he ſaith, there he met with you, (though
you ſaid you were not there that day) going to the Banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
houſe, that you ſpoke to <hi>Tench</hi> and whiſpered in his ear,
and that <hi>Tench</hi> went and knockt Staples on the Scaffold; he
meeting <hi>Tench</hi> ſaid, what are you a Hangman? ſaith <hi>Tench,</hi>
this day will be a happy day; he ſaith, after all this <hi>Hugh Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
was upon the Scaffold, and that he went out with the
Hangman—</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Peters.</speaker>
                     <p>I do profeſs to your Lordſhips before Angels and men,
that I did not ſtir out of my Chamber that day.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. Ch. B.</speaker>
                     <p>The Council doth not put relyance upon that,
becauſe of what your witneſs ſaith, though his evidence is not
at all ſatisfactory. The next is <hi>Clough,</hi> and he ſwears this, that
he ſaw you in the Painted Chamber with the Council of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
and there you deſired them to call on God for a bleſſing
upon their buſineſs, and there you ſaid, O Lord what a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
it is to ſee this great City fall down before us, and what
a ſtir is there to bring this great man to tryal, without
whoſe blood he will turn us all into blood if he reign again,
and this was about a month before the King was murthered.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. Ch. Bar.</speaker>
                     <p>You hear it Mr. <hi>Peters.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Peters.</speaker>
                     <p>Some part I did, but it is impoſſible for me to bear down
many witneſſes, indeed my Lord, I ſay this, they are marvellous
uncharitable, and ſpeak many falſe things.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. Ch. Bar.</speaker>
                     <p>The next is this, the teſtimony concerning ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Sermons of yours; and let me tell you, the Pulpit ought
not to be a place where men with impunity may ſpeak any
thing, what they liſt of Sedition and Treaſon.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Peters.</speaker>
                     <p>I am of the ſame judgement my ſelf, my Lord.</p>

                     <speaker>L. Ch. Bar.</speaker>
                     <p>And there was a ſolemn day to ſeek God, then
you preached at St. <hi>Margarets</hi> Church, this was Mr. <hi>Bever,</hi>
in he came and heard you talk much of <hi>Barab.</hi> and our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
there you fell upon this, ſpeaking of the K. it is a ſad thing
that it ſhould now be a queſtion, whether we ſhould crucifie
our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, or that great <hi>Barabbas,</hi> ſpeaking of
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:56280:106"/>
the King; you call'd him Traytor, Tyrant, Murtherer of
his ſubjects, and the like, you went on in a way of a ſtory,
theſe Citizens for a little Trading they will have Chriſt cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and the great <hi>Barabbas</hi> at <hi>Windſor</hi> releaſed, and ſaid you,
the Clergy, the Aſſembly, they are all for crucifying Chriſt
and releaſing <hi>Barabbas;</hi> you made that expreſſion, <hi>O Jeſus,
what ſhall we do?</hi> the King was a Priſoner then at <hi>Windſor,</hi>
you made your application to the Parliament that was then
preſent, you told them the people did expect Juſtice from
them, you muſt not prefer the great Tyrant and Traytor,
naming the King, to theſe poor hearts (the <hi>Redcoats</hi> ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by.)</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Peters.</speaker>
                     <p>I muſt profeſs againſt moſt of that.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lord Chief Baron.</speaker>
                     <p>There is the ſame by others. It is
further proved by the Order that you were appointed to
preach.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Peters.</speaker>
                     <p>I do not deny I preached, but not theſe things.</p>

                     <speaker>Lord Chief Bar.</speaker>
                     <p>The next thing is this, there was one Mr.
<hi>Chaſe,</hi> this was during the tryal, he ſaith you preached at
<hi>Whitehall</hi> upon this Text, the 149. <hi>Pſalm, to bind their Kings
in chains, and their Nobles in fetters of iron:</hi> you had two
or three other verſes more; then you made a diſcourſe
of a Major and a Biſhops man, the Biſhops man being
drunk, the Major committed him to priſon, the Biſhop
being angry, asked by what authority, the Major ſaid,
there was an Act of Parliament for it, he did not find
that either the Biſhop or his man was excepted, you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
that to the King, ſaid you, I will ſhew you an act of
the Bible, <hi>Whoſoever ſheds mans blood, by man ſhall his blood
be ſhed,</hi> this doth not except the King, Prince, Prince <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert,</hi>
Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> or any of that rabble.</p>

                     <p>You ſaid further, This is the day that
I and many other Saints of God have prayed for theſe many
years; and <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> laughed at that time. The next
witneſs was <hi>Tongue,</hi> he heard you preach, and he ſwears the
ſame with the former; that you applauded the ſouldiers,
and that you hoped to ſee ſuch another day following, as
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:56280:106"/>
the day before, and that bleſſed be God the houſe is purged,
and the Lords will be ſhortly pull'd out; and the twenty
eighth day of <hi>January,</hi> which was the day after the King
was ſentenced, at Saint <hi>James</hi>'s his Chappel, you took for
your Text the 149. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> the 6, 7, 8 and 9 verſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
theſe words were part, <hi>To bind their Kings in chains, and
their Nobles with fetters of iron,</hi> there in the middle of that
Sermon having ſpoken before of the King, you ſaid you
did intend to preach before the <hi>poor wretch,</hi> upon the 14
of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the 18, 19 and 20 verſes, ſpeaking of all the Kings
of the nations, <hi>Thou art caſt out of thy grave like an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
branch, &amp;c.</hi> he ſaith further, you ſaid look upon your
leſſer Bibles, and you will find the title is, <hi>The Tyrants fall.</hi>
There is another witneſs, that is one <hi>Bowdler,</hi> a few days
before the Kings death, at <hi>S. Sepulchres,</hi> there you fell upon
the old compariſon, all along you compared the King to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabbas,</hi>
and that a great many would have Chriſt crucified,
and <hi>Barabbas</hi> releaſed, all along comparing the King to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabbas.</hi>
One more, and that was <hi>Ryder,</hi> he heard this text, <hi>He
ſhall call his name Emanuel,</hi> you fell to ſpeak of news, what ſhall
become of the King? and you ſaid the King was <hi>Barabbas,</hi>
and a great many would rather have <hi>Chriſt</hi> crucified than
<hi>Barabbas.</hi> And then Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> he ſaith, that after the King
was firſt brought to his tryal, he heard you ſay this, I have
prayed and preached this twenty years, and now may I ſay
with old <hi>Simeon, Lord now letteſt thou thy ſervant depart in peace,
for mine eyes have ſeen thy ſalvation:</hi> he mentions that you
made uſe of the other compariſon of the Major and the
Biſhops man, and inferred from thence, that the King and
Prince, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were not excepted out of the Scripture,
where it is ſaid, <hi>Whoſoever ſheds mans blood, &amp;c.</hi> you have
heard all this witneſſed againſt you, what have you to ſay for

                     <p>If the priſoner can ſay no more, here is this

<hi>Kings</hi> death, at <hi>Windſor,</hi> at <hi>Ware,</hi> in <hi>Colemanſtreet,</hi> in the
<hi>Painted Chamber,</hi> and in <hi>Bradſhaws</hi> houſe; and four witneſſes
to prove this; there are two witneſſes to his compariſon of
the K. and <hi>Barabbas,</hi> and two witneſſes to his text of binding
their K. inchains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> proof that he hath been in action in <hi>New-Eng.</hi>
that he came from it with that intent, and then went to
<hi>Holland,</hi> that he had been in arms, that he called the day of his
Majeſties tryal a glorious day, reſembling the judging of the
world by Saints, he prays for this in the <hi>Painted Chamber,</hi>
preaches for it at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> S. <hi>James</hi>'s Chapel, <hi>Sepulchres,</hi>
what man could more contrive the death of the King than
this miſerable Prieſt hath done? the honour of the Pulpit is
to be vindicated, and the death of this man will preach bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than his life did, it may be a means to convert many a
miſerable perſon whom the preaching of this perſon
hath ſeduced, for many come here, and ſay they did
it <hi>in the fear of the Lord,</hi> and now you ſee who taught

                     <p>You are both perſons of that ingenuous and
liberal education as I hope I ſhall not need to tell you what
it is to die, you have had a great a deal of time to think of
it; you could not but think of this iſſue of your doings long
ago, and therefore I ſhall ſpare my labour of telling you
what it is to die, and of that eternity that you are to enter
into, only give me leave in a few words in relation to both
of your profeſſions to ſay ſomething, to ſhew the nature and
hainouſneſs of this offence, the murther of the King, if you
were not actually guilty of putting the King to death, nay,
admitting (in charity) you had no intent to go as far as you
did, you are by the laws of Chriſt, and this Nation, guilty
of high Treaſon, in that, you that are a Lawyer know very
well (and I ſpeak it that you may lay it to your heart in the
convictions of your conſcience. I muſt ſay to you as <hi>Joſhua</hi>
ſaid to <hi>Achan, my ſon give glory to God and confeſs,</hi> and it would
become you ſo to do,) you know very well it is the law of
this Nation, that no one houſe nor both houſes of Parliament
have any coercive power over the King, much leſs to put him
to death; you know (as you cited very well) that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoning
of the King is Treaſon. You know both of you,
this is an undoubted truth, the rule of Law is, that the King
can do no wrong, that is, the King can do no wrong in
the eſtimation of Law, he may do ſome particular Acts
as a private perſon; but he can do little prejudice in his
own perſon; if he would hurt any, it muſt be by Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
in that caſe the Law provides a remedy, if he doth it
by Miniſters, they muſt anſwer for it. The King of <hi>England</hi>
is one of thoſe Princes who hath an Imperial Crown, what is
that? It is not to do what he will, no, but it is, that he ſhall not
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:56280:108"/>
be puniſhed in his own perſon if he doth that which in it
ſelf is unlawful. Now remember this when you took the
oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy (I preſume you both did
ſo) what was your oath of Supremacy? It was this, that
the King was the only Supream Governour of theſe Realms,
it goes farther, as he was Supream Governour, ſo he was
the only Supream Governour, that excludes Coordination,
you ſwear farther, that you will to the utmoſt of your
power defend the King againſt all conſpiracies and attempts
whatſoever, truly you that were a Lawyer when you had
thus ſworn, your fee could be no excuſe againſt what you
had ſworn to. We know that the King in his politick or
natural capacity, is not only <hi>ſalus populi</hi> but <hi>ſalus Reipublicae.</hi>
The Law hath taken care that the people ſhall have juſtice
and right, the Kings perſon ought not to be touched, the
<hi>King</hi> himſelf is pleaſed to judge by the Law, you ſee he doth
by Law queſtion the death of his Father, he doth not judge
it himſelf, but the Law judges it. Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> knows very
well he ſubſcribed the 39. Articles of Religion, look upon
them that were made in 1552. and upon thoſe Articles that
were confirmed in 13. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> is there acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
to have the chief power in theſe Nations, the med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with the <hi>King</hi> was a Jeſutical doctrine; This I ſpeak
not that the <hi>King</hi> ſhould or ought to govern but by the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
laws of the land, they that keep within the bounds
of the law are happy, you that are a Lawyer, know this in
point of law, and you that are a Divine, know this in point
of Divinity. You both know the truth of it, and when
you have thought upon it, I hope you will reflect upon that
horrid crime, the ſhedding of Royal Blood. You ſee
he had granted all thoſe grievances of the people, taken
them away, ſecured them for the future, and at this very
time, when this horrid act was done, you ſee he had gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
all at the deſire of the people, he had made thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions
ſuch, as (were it not in reſpect of others more than
thoſe that treated themſelves) they thought was more than
could be expected by the Nation. You that had a hand in
the <hi>Kings</hi> death, it falls upon you, the guilt of it, becauſe
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:56280:109"/>
you were ſome of thoſe inſtruments that aſſiſted thoſe
perſons that broke the Treaty, prepare your ſelves for
that death which you are to die, it is a debt which we
all owe to nature, if in this caſe there is ſomething of
ſhame comes to you, it is that you muſt take as part of
the reward of your ſin. The only work I have now to
do, is to pronouce the Judgment, and this is the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Court, and the Court doth award, That
both of you be led back to the place from whence you

that are Sworn of this Jury, The High Court of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice</hi>
that was Erected for Tryal of the late King, it had
all the formalities of a Court to put in Execution that
bloody Act; they had their <hi>Preſident,</hi> their Council, their
Chaplain, and their Guards: ſome of their Judges have
been already Tryed, one of their Council, and their Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain.
Now my Lord, we come to the Guards, and this
Gentleman at the Bar, that is now the Priſoner, He was
Commander of that Black Guard, that cruel and bloody
Guard: The Indictment is, <hi>That he did Imagin and compaſs
the Death</hi> of the King; there be ſeveral overt acts that are
mentioned in the Indictment as Evidences of that Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as the conſultation to bring him to Tryal, the Actual
bringing him to Tryal, and the Bloody Execution upon the
Scaffold; Our Evidence ſhall be this, That during the time
of the Tryal, the Priſoner at the Bar did Command the
Souldiers in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-Hall, himſelf did keep the Entrance
into the Court, and when <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> did ſpeak to the King
and told him he trifled away time, and required his anſwer
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:56280:110"/>
to the charge exhibited in the Name of the Commons of
<hi>England</hi> Aſſembled in Parliament, and the good People of
<hi>England;</hi> that a Noble perſon in the Gallery there cryed
out, it was a <hi>Lye,</hi> ſaying, that above half the Commons diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned
it, ſaying, where are theſe good people? <hi>it is a lye,</hi>
Oliver Cromwel <hi>is a Traytor;</hi> this bloodly Fellow command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Souldiers to ſhoot her: he did ſeveral times com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
and encourage the Souldiers to cry out <hi>Juſtice, juſtice;</hi>
and the laſt day of that horrid Tryal, called by them, <hi>the
day of Judgement;</hi> he likewiſe commanded them to cry out
<hi>Execution, Execution,</hi> and when ſome of them would not
do it, he had the Valour to <hi>Beat</hi> them. My Lords and
Gentlemen of the Jury, if we prove any of theſe particulars
to demonſtrate unto you that he was Guilty of compaſſing
and imagining the King's Death, it is equal as if we had
proved he did Actually cut off the King's head.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir P. Tem.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, being preſent, and engaged by ſome
perſons of Honour, Servants of his late Majeſty, to be preſent
when that horrid Murther was acting before this Court of
Juſtice (as they called it) I was preſent at all the Tryals of
the King, and very near him, I heard the King demand from
<hi>Bradſhaw</hi> by what Authority and <hi>Commiſſion</hi> they proceeded
thus ſtrangely to Try him. Then I heard the Lady <hi>Fairfax</hi>
and one Mrs. <hi>Nelſon</hi> (my Siſter) after the exhibiting of the
charge in the Name of the Commons Aſſembled in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the good people of this Kingdom againſt <hi>Charles
Stuart</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> I ſay I heard the ſaid Lady cry out
from a Gallery over the Court, <hi>Not half the people; it is falſe!
where are they or their Conſents? Oliver Cromwell is a Traitor!</hi>
Upon which I heard the Priſoner at the Bar cry out, Down
with the Whores, ſhoot them; which made me take the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
notice of him, ſeeing him in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Souldiers there, I ſaw him the moſt activeſt perſon
there; and during the time that the King was urging to be
heard, he was then laughing, entertaining his Souldiers, ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing
aloud, whilſt ſome of the Souldiers by his ſuffering, and
(I believe) procurement, did fire powder in the palms of their
hands, that they did not onely offend his Majeſties ſmell, but
enforced him to riſe up out of his Chair, and with his hand
to turn away the ſmoke; and after this he turned about to
the people and ſmiled upon them, and thoſe Souldiers that
ſo rudely treated him: Then turning himſelf to <hi>Bradſhaw,</hi>
ſaid to him and the Court, There are ſome ſitting here (fixing
his Eyes upon ſome perſons near <hi>Bradſhaw)</hi> that well knew,
that if I would have Forfeited or Betrayed the Liberties and
Rights of the People, I need not have come hither, (or words
to this effect:) But their Liberties and Rights are dearer and
nearer to me than my three Kingdoms; nay than my life
it ſelf. Therefore I deſire you to hear me, and remember,
that I am your lawful King that have done you many Acts
of Grace and Favour.</p>
                  <p>After which this perſon Mr. <hi>Axtell,</hi> Priſoner at the Bar, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
his Souldiers to cry out, <hi>Juſtice,</hi> which the Souldiers
not readily obeying of him, I ſaw him beat four or five of
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:56280:113"/>
them with his Cane, until they cried out, (with himſelf)
<hi>Juſtice, Juſtice, Execution, Execution,</hi> which made me turn to
a Noble Lord, by whom I then ſtood, and ſaid, Pray my
Lord take notice, there is not above 4 or 5 that cry out <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
Juſtice:</hi> I heard alſo of their ſpitting in the Kings Face;
and I think no bodies ſufferings have been ſo like thoſe of
our Saviour Chriſt Jeſus, as his Majeſties were. After this,
this perſons crying <hi>Juſtice, Juſtice, Execution, Execution</hi> a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
time, the Court proceeded to paſs a Sentence; the which
his Majeſty preſſed hard againſt, and told him, Sir, before you
paſs that ugly Sentence (which I very well underſtand you
are intended to do,) I deſire you to hear me, hear me, hear
me, paſſionately and not affectionately expreſſing it, which
they denying the King, and the notice of <hi>Juſtice, Juſtice, Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
Execution,</hi> being repeated, they proceeded, and read
that ugly Sentence of Death: after which his Majeſty was
immediately hurried away from the Bar into a common Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,
where he was carried by two common Porters; which
Cedan I followed to the middle of King's Street, where I
ſaw the two Porters, in reverence, go bare, till the Souldiers
(under the Command of the Priſoner at the Bar) beat them,
and would not ſuffer them to go bare when they carried
him. After this the people cried out, What do you carry the
King in a common Cedan as they carry ſuch as have the
Plague? God deliver your Majeſty out of ſuch Enemies hands.
In which Street I was forced to leave the ſight of his Majeſty,
occaſioned by the injuries and hurts I received in my perſon
from the Souldiers under <hi>Axtel</hi>'s command, they carrying him
through the Streets ſhouting in triumph. A ſhort time after
I received an importuate command from a Lady of great
Honour (a Servant of his Majeſties) that I would endeavour
to find out where the body of the <hi>Martyr'd King</hi> was, and to
give her an account where it then was: Applying my ſelf to
<hi>Whitehall,</hi> after two or threeſcore Intreaties, I was denyed;
but underſtanding that money would do it, I gave the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
then under the command of Mr. <hi>Axtell</hi> that then kept it,
to ſhew it me, half a piece, who in a ſcoffing manner took
me by the hand, ſaid, <hi>If thou thinkeſt there is any ſanctity or
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:56280:113"/>
holineſs in it, look here;</hi> where I ſaw the Head of that bleſſed
martyr'd King lie in a Coffin with his Body, which ſmiled
as perfectly as if it had been alive: this is the ſad account of
the martyr'd King, and this ſad horrid Priſoner Mr. <hi>Axtell.</hi>

a principal Officer that did then hold his Majeſty Priſoner at

I never was a Guard to his Majeſty, or had any thing to do

entertaining the Souldiers. I do not charge you that you
commanded thoſe Halbertiers, but thoſe <hi>Red-coats;</hi> you
were all in <hi>Red:</hi> I ſaw you cane thoſe 4 or 5 Souldiers I

<hi>Axtell,</hi> ſo far as I remember; truly, I have not ſeen him
ſince before this day, nor have had any reaſon to have known
him, but that I ſaw him very active in giving commands to
the Souldiers there: this Gentleman was keeping the <hi>Court,</hi>
letting ſome in, and putting others out: he ſeemed to have
command of it; One day (whether it was about ſome paſſage
or their Preſidents Speech I know not,) there was a Lady in
the ſame Gallery where I ſtood, and ſome muttering, <hi>It is
a lye, not half the people,</hi> or words to this effect. He the now
Priſoner at the Bar ſtanding below in the Court within the
Bar not far from <hi>Dendy,</hi> with ſome five or ſix Souldiers;
upon this muttering and diſturbance (as he apprehended)
to the Court, he called to the Souldiers, ſaying, Shoot them
if they ſpeak one word more; they did alſo preſent the
muzles of their Muskets up to the Gallery: My Lord, by
this we were very huſh; after that immediately within half
a quarter of an hour, <hi>Dendy</hi> came to the Gallery from the
Court to know who it was that made that diſturbance. But
the Lady was withdrawn into my Chamber, and did not
come out afterwards.</p>

at <hi>Whitehall;</hi> there were ſome Cavaliers then in the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
it was my fortune I came into your Company, I wiſh
I never had: you commanded more beſides my ſelf to be a
Witneſs againſt the King, and Juſtice <hi>Cook</hi> took my Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation:
you brought me in, you commanded the Guards that
time at <hi>Whitehall</hi> when the King was upon his Tryal.</p>

Souldiers, to take a Boat and go down to the common <hi>Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
that liv'd beyond the <hi>Tower</hi> to execute the King; he is

that were imployed in that ſervice, you know them as
well as I do; truly Sir not I, ſaid I, I ſaw them in Vizards

them, it is true ſaith he, my ſelf and others were imployed
in that affair in order to the Execution; but there were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
perſons came and offered themſelves out of a kind of

perſons whom we did not know, but we made choice

                  <p>My Lords, I muſt acknowledg my ignorance of the
Laws, being a thing I never ſtudied, nor have the knowledg
of, but I have heard it is the duty of your Lordſhips and
the Judges to be of Counſel for the Priſoner in things
wherein he is ignorant in matters of law, to make his juſt
defence; and therefore my Lord the Indictment it ſelf being
matter of law, if your Lordſhips pleaſe not to grant me
Counſel to ſpeak to matrers of law, I humbly pray that your
Lordſhips will be pleaſed that for want of knowledg, forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
punctilloes, and niceties of the Law, I might not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
my ſelf: I have heard by a learned Judg, that though the
Judg be of Counſel to the King, yet by his Oath he is alſo
to be Counſellor to the Priſoner, and ſtands as a Mediator
between the King and Priſoner, and therefore my Lord I ſhall
beg that humble favour, that wherein I ſhall fall ſhort to
make the beſt improvement of my Plea in matter of law, that
your Lordſhips will help me, and not take advantages againſt
me, as to the niceties, formalities, and punctilloes of the Law;
and my Lord this is a reſemblance of that Great day where
Chriſt will be Judg, and will judg the ſecrets of all hearts,
and of all words, and of all perſons, and by him all Actions
are weighed, knows all our hearts whether there be malice,
or how it ſtands in the frame of each heart before him in this
place, and therefore I hope there will be nothing by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judging,
or any thing by precluding to be ſo black a perſon
as it ſeemed to be ſaid againſt me. <hi>My Lords,</hi> I muſt
ſhorten the time and come to ſpeak as to the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

                  <p>As to what Sir,</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Axt.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſpeak as to the Authority by which or under which
I acted, I humbly conceive, my Lord, under favour, that I
am not within the compaſs of that Statute of the <hi>25th</hi> of
<hi>Edward</hi> the Third, for that queſtionleſs muſt intend private
perſons, <hi>Counſelling, Compaſſing, or Imagining the death of the
King.</hi> But you know, my Lords, the War was firſt ſtated by
the Lords and Commons the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> and by
vertue of their Authority was forced to be raiſed, and they
pretended by law that the right of the <hi>Militia</hi> was in them,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:56280:117"/>
and your Lordſhips will remember in ſeveral Declarations
and Acts that was mutually exchanged between his Majeſty
and Parliament, and, my Lord, that was the Authority the
Lords and Commons aſſembled in Parliament, raiſed a Force,
and made the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> Ceneral, and after him the Earl
of <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> of the Eaſtern Aſſociation, and after that Sir
<hi>Tho. Fairfax</hi> Lord General of the Forces; by this Authority
I acted, and this Authority I humbly conceive to be legal,
becauſe this Parliament was called by the Kings Writ, choſen
by the People, and paſſed a Bill they ſhould not be diſſolved
without their own conſents, that the Parliament was in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
when the Tryal was, and a queſtion whether yet legally
Diſſolved.</p>
                  <p>In the fourth place they were not only owned and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at home but abroad, to be the chief Authority of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and alſo owned by Foreign States and Kingdoms, ſent
Ambaſſadors to that purpoſe, under them did all the Judges
of the Land Act, who ought to be the Eye of the Land and
the very light of the People, to Guide them in their right
Actions, and I remember the Judges upon Tryal (I have
read it of High Treaſon,) Judg <hi>Thorp, Nicholas</hi> and <hi>Jermin</hi>
have declared it publickly, That it was a lawful juſtifiable
thing by the Law of the Land to obey the Parliament of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
My Lord, it further appears, as to their Authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the People, of this Nation petitioning them as the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
and lawful Authority: and, <hi>My Lords,</hi> as I have heard
it hath been objected, that the Houſes of Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
could make no Act. Truly, my Lord, if you will not
allow them to be Acts, though they intitle them ſo, call them
ſo, and obeyed as ſo by the Judges, Miniſters, and Officers
of State, and by all other perſons in the Nation, yet I hope
they cannot be denied to be Orders of Parliament; and were
they no more but Orders, yet were they ſufficient, as I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
couceive, to bear out ſuch as acted thereby. And my
Lord, the Parliament thus conſtituted, and having made their
Generals, he by their Authority did conſtitute and appoint me
to be an Inferior Officer in the Army, ſerving them in the
quarters of the Parliament, and under and within their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:56280:117"/>
and what I have done, my Lord, it hath been done only
as a Souldier, deriving my power from the General, he
had his power from the Fountain, to wit, the Lords and
Commons; and, my Lord, this being done, as hath been
ſaid by ſeveral, that I was there, and had command at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter-Hall;</hi>
truly, my Lord, if the Parliament command
the General, and the General the inferiour Officers, I am
bound by my Commiſſion, according to the Laws and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms
of War to be where the Regiment is; I came not thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
voluntarily, but by command of the General, who had
a Commiſſion (as I ſaid before) from the Parliament. I was
no Counſellor, no Contriver, I was no Parliament-man,
none of the Judges, none that Sentenced, Signed, none that
had any hand in the Execution, onely that which is charged
is that I was an Officer in the Army, if that be ſo great a
crime, I conceive I am no more guilty than the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,
Fairfax,</hi> or the Lord of <hi>Mancheſter.</hi>

                  <p>My Lords, That is the main thing they do inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
my Lord, I am no more guilty than his Excellency the
Lord General <hi>Monck,</hi> who Acted by the ſame Authority, and
all the People in the three Nations; and my Lord, I do hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
ſuppoſe if the Authority had been only an Authority in
Fact and not Right, yet thoſe that Acted under them, ought
not to be queſtioned; but if the Authority commanded what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
offence they committed, eſpecially that that guided
me was no leſs than the declared Judgment of the Lords and
Commons ſitting in Parliament; they declared that was
their right as to the <hi>Militia,</hi> and having explained ſeveral
Statutes of <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th, wherein the King having enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed
Declarations with the Parliament, the Parliament
comes to make an Explanation on that Statute; and, my
Lord it is in <hi>Folio</hi> 280. wherein they do poſitively expound
it, and declare it as their allowed Judgment. To clear up
all ſcruples to all that ſhould take up Arms for them; ſaith
the <hi>Parliament</hi> there as to the Statute of 11. of <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th.
Chapter the firſt, which is printed at large, comes there to
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:56280:118"/>
explain it in general, and comes here, <hi>Folio</hi> 281. and gives
this Judgment; <hi>It is not, ſay they, agreeable to Reaſon or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
that any ones duty ſhould be known, if the Judgment of
the High Court of Parliament be not a Rule or Guide to them.</hi>
In the next place, this is the next Guidance, Rule, and
Judgment of <hi>Parliament,</hi> upon the Expoſition of this Statute
and as they have ſaid in ſeveral places (was it not too much
to take up your Lordſhips time) they are the proper <hi>Judges
and Expounders of the Laws.</hi> The High Court of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
have taken upon them to expound the Law, and ſaid,
that we Lawyers will give the meaning of the Text contrary
to what they have expounded the meaning under their hands:
in the ſame <hi>Declaration</hi> his Majeſty is pleaſed to quit that
Statute upon which I ſtand Indicted, the 25th. of <hi>Edward</hi>
the Third, where they do my Lord expound that very Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
in the Declaration made in 1643. <hi>Folio</hi> 722. I come to
the declared Judgment, wherein they did poſitively ſay, that
the perſons that do Act under their Authority, ought not to
be queſtioned as perſons Guilty <hi>Folio</hi> 727. that is the Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
that the Lords and Commons Aſſembled in <hi>Parliament</hi>
doth make upon the ſtatute.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, I have this further to ſay, that if a
Houſe of Commons Aſſembled in <hi>Parliament</hi> may be Guilty
of Treaſon; (for the truth is, if I Acted Treaſon that Acted
under the Authority of the Lords and Commons in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and of the Commons in Parliament) then doubtleſs
they muſt begin the Treaſon: if the Houſe of Commons,
who are the collective body and Repreſentation of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
all the people of <hi>England,</hi> who choſe them, are guilty
too; and then where will there be a Jury to try this? con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Commons alone, I have been over ruled.</p>

an Authority which you know your ſelf was no Authority;
you would now for your defence for life (and it is reaſon you
ſhould make as full a defence for life as you can) you would
ſhelter your ſelf under that Authority, which I am ſorry I
muſt ſay were one of the greateſt Violators of: you cannot
forget how near a cloſe of this bloody war by the mercy of
God, this Nation was when the Army interpoſed, whoſe
Trade it was to live by War, when they had felt ſo much of
the ſweet of War they would not ſuffer the people to enjoy
peace, though the Lords and Repreſentatives in Parliament
had agreed to it; A Treaty was begun, terms of peace pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
and agreed to, this you cannot forget, and will
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:56280:119"/>
have no need of Notes or Books to help your Memory:
when the people Groaned under the miſeries of War, and
thirſted after Peace, then came up the Army, who were ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
to the Parliament till that time, taking upon them the
Authority (you cannot forget that, your ſelf was one of the
number that came to offer accuſations againſt the majority of
the Commons Houſe, calling them Rotten Members;) the
Houſe of Lords was not then ſuffered to ſit, they would not
joyn in that Ordinance that was preparing for the Tryal of
the King; when the Lords had refuſed, they were no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
fit to be Lords neither; then comes in a new Authority
which we never heard of before; a remnant of the Houſe
of Commons joyning with the Army, that had driven away
the greateſt part of the Houſe of Commons; (for in all Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies
and Courts the major part muſt determine, or no
determination) after this courſe was taken, then is an Act
ſet on foot, they take upon them by Votes of their own to
be the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> that the ſupreme power of
the Nation is in the Repreſentatives of the people; who
were they? thoſe few only that remained almoſt all the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
Counties and Burroughs of <hi>England</hi> had none left to
repreſent them, they were driven away by Force, then was
this Act of Parliament (ſuch an Act as was never heard of
before) ſet on foot and paſſed as an Act by a few of the
Houſe of Commons, if you can plead this for your defence,
this is the Act that you muſt ſhelter under. But you know
the Lords and Commons had Unanimouſly reſolved for peace,
and ſo agree with the King: if this Act will be any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
you may plead it to the full; and this is all you have
to ſay; therefore go upon no Forreign matter.</p>

I did but my duty in going to my Regiment, the General
ſaith, go to ſuch a place, ſtay there, if I refuſe, by the law

                  <p>I hope you will not think it much to give me ſome
more freedom for my own defence for life; My Lord, I
muſt needs ſay though there was a force on the Parliament,
I am not to juſtifie it; I was no Lawyer, no Stateſman, no
Councellor, but a Souldier; and if the General who had a
Commiſſion from the Lords and Commons, and that ſome
years before and after the King's Death, be not guilty of
Treaſon, what I did was by command from my General;
and though I am charged with being in Arms in <hi>Weſtminſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi>
and at ſuch and ſuch a place, yet it was not a Volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Act; for I was bound to obey my General; I do humbly
pray that I may have your Lordſhips Judgment in this point;
I muſt ſay it was from the ſenſe of their expoſition of the
Law and of the Statutes, and from the Authority that every
one took up Arms for and ſerved them, and obeyed either
the one General or the other; I ſay it was under this very
Authority, and this muſt needs acquit me from all the guilt
that is laid upon me.</p>

                  <p>You put your ſelf upon the Judgment of the
Court upon this which you call a point in Law. Firſt, it is
manifeſt that there is no excuſe at all for Treaſon, no man
by his Commiſſion can warrant the doing of an Act which is
Treaſon: you muſt take notice of the Authority whether it
be good or no, your Commiſſion was not to put the King to
Death, but on the contrary, to preſerve the Kings life. The
Lords and Commons what they did, we do not meddle with
the Reaſon and Ground of what they did was the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Kings Perſon, as well as the maintenance of the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:56280:120"/>
Laws and Liberties of this Nation, they made Proteſtations,
Declarations, and Oaths for the preſervation of the King's
Perſon; and you could not but take notice of thoſe things:
Now whereas you go about to ſhroud your ſelf under the Lord
<hi>Fairfax,</hi> he had no ſuch Power, and therefore you can challenge
no more then he had: and to what you ſay concerning the
Judgment of the Parliament, there will be a great deal of
difference between a particular Caſe, and a Declaration of
Lords and Commons; there is nothing you have ſaid that hath
any thing of Force, and God forbid you ſhould make uſe of it;
But I muſt tell you, you could not but notoriouſly know all
thoſe Tranſactions that were in the Army, what the Army had
done, that they came up with Swords in their Hands, and
turn'd out whom they would; you ſaw what the Lords and
Commons had done, that the Treaty was ready for his Birth;
And then you come up with your Mermidons, with Force and
Arms and Exclude the greateſt part of the Members, and then
the Lords were laid aſide: it is true, the Lords were not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſſolved, but they would not ſuffer them to Sit nor Act at
all, and this was apparent to the Nation. If men under colour
and pretence of ſuch things, Namely, that a few perſons (for
ſo they were) but an Eighth part of the Houſe of Commons
permitted to remain, and of that Eighth part (which was but
46 in the whole) there were but 26 that Voted that Act
which you ſay you obeyed: but you ſay you obeyed the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral:
you were not to obey the General in this Caſe; for
the Facts that you have committed, are not charged as Acts
of War; you are not charged for bringing the Souldiers in,
but for thoſe Violent Actions that you were guilty of there;
you made the Souldiers cry out, <hi>Juſtice, Juſtice, Execution, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution,</hi>
you ſent officiouſly for a <hi>Hang-man</hi> to come down to
you; your Commiſſion gave you no power for this, the Death
of the King you know how it was deſigned, you know the Act
for the bringing in of that Commiſſion (as they call'd it) to
ſit in juſtice was after the Houſe of Commons was reduced to
a very ſmall Number, and ſome of thoſe diſſenting too, what
you did Act under that Authority, if you can juſtifie it, in the
Name of God ſay ſo, but do not Engage the Nation in thoſe
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:56280:121"/>
things which they abhorred, and by the mercy of God are laid
aſleep.</p>

that you had received a Commiſſion from the General to do
thoſe things with which you ſtand charged it were ſomething,
then were it proper for you to plead it, and the Court to judg.
Pray take this along with you, the General gave you no ſuch
command, what you are charged with in the Indictment, <hi>is
for Compaſſing and Imagining the Death of the King,</hi> and that
by ſuch and ſuch overt acts, as making your Souldiers cry out
<hi>Juſtice and Execution,</hi> for being active and forward in ſending
for the <hi>Executioner,</hi> and ſuch other Acts, prove theſe are in
your Commiſſion, and you ſay ſomething: I am ſure, you
cannot be ignorant, that That very Authority that you do now
urge to give life and power to your Actions, that you deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, laid it in the duſt, acted contrary to it ſeveral ways
when the Parliament proteſted againſt fetching the King from
<hi>Holmby</hi> as they did, when they went on proceeding in the
way of peace, then came you up to the Bar (I think you your
ſelf) and charged ſome of the Members; firſt 11 as rotten
Members, and theſe Men were forced away; this you know
your General had no Commiſſion to do, and this you know
was a Violation of that Power that gave our General the
Commiſſion. After that when the Treaty was brought on in
the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> when there was great hopes of peace, then
you knew the King was hurried thence by Force, which the
Parliament proteſted againſt. After that when both the Houſe
of Commons and Lords came to conſider of one particular
that paſſed, they reſolved that it was ſufficient ground to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
on for the ſettlement of peace; then did you fall upon
theſe Houſes and tear them in pieces, and throwing out above
200, ſuffering only about 40 to remain, and they were glad to
ſend for one Member out of Priſon to make up a Houſe. That
which you ſay of the Supreme Authority, and that by Vertue
of which you did Act; it ſhews that you did not at all go by
any Authority, but you followed your own Luſts; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

the Houſe of Commons, they were Grandees, perſons of a
greater Quality; I was an inferior Officer, I was never at the
Houſe Bar, but upon preſenting one Petition to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from the Army. I ſhall now come to ſpeak to the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
which hath been given particularly againſt me; and the
firſt, my Lord, is Mr. <hi>Simpſon,</hi> he ſaith, I had the Commands
of the Guards at <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall.</hi> My Lords, I have told you
already, ſhewn you by what Authority I came thither, and
that I ought not to refuſe; if I had, according to the laws of
War, I muſt have ſuffer'd death; and that is all as to Mr.
<hi>Sympſon,</hi> only that a Lady (he knows not who) ſpake ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
there.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Ch. Bar.</speaker>
                  <p>He ſaith he heard you bid the Souldiers give
fire againſt the Lady.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Axt.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, I muſt ſay, if there was any Lady that did
ſpeak, who ſhe was I know no more than the leaſt child here:
but my Lord, to ſilence a Lady, I ſuppoſe is no Treaſon. If
a Lady will talk impertinently, it is no Treaſon to bid her
hold her tongue.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Ch. Bar.</speaker>
                  <p>A Lady was ſpeaking pertinently enough, when
ſhe heard <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> ſay to the King, ſuch a Charge is exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:56280:122"/>
a charge of High Treaſon againſt Him, <hi>in the Name of the
Commons aſſembled in Parliament, and the good People of</hi> England;
ſhe ſaid, <hi>That was a lye, not half, nor a quarter of the people of
England, That</hi> Oliver Cromwel <hi>was a Traytor;</hi> Then you took
upon you to command Souldiers to fire at her; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
they levelled the muzles of their Muſquets towards her.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Axtell.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, as to that particular concerning <hi>Oliver
Cromwell,</hi> or any other words concerning the Court, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
them not; but if any interruption was made, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the peace, to deſire a Woman to hold her tongue is no
Treaſon. To the next particular wherein <hi>Col. Huncks</hi> ſaith,
at a door at a certain lodging where <hi>Ireton</hi> and <hi>Harriſon</hi> were
in Bed together, he ſaith, that upon his refuſal to ſign the
Warrant for executing the King, I ſaid to him, Col. <hi>Huncks,
I am aſhamed of you, the Ship is now coming into Harbour, and
will you ſtrike Sayle before we come to Anchor?</hi> truly my Lord I
think all that amounts to nothing, if it were ſo, which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
it; for to bring the Ship into Harbor, what is that? there
is no perſon named, Fact named, nor Deſign named? and I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to my conſcience, I remember not the time, place, perſon,
or words; and I can call for Col. <hi>Phayre</hi> and Col. <hi>Hacker,</hi> who
were there; for I deſire things may appear right, I deſire they
two perſons may be called for their Evidence in that point.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. ch. Bar.</speaker>
                  <p>They both are in the ſame condition, Col. <hi>Hacker</hi>
in the priſon behind you, Col. <hi>Phayre,</hi> in the Tower; Mr. <hi>Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,</hi>
you know the ſtrength of one Affirmative witneſs, I ſaw
ſuch a man, and heard ſuch a man ſay, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is more then if
twenty ſhould witneſs they ſtood by, but did not ſee him, or
hear him ſpeak.</p>

                  <speaker>Axt.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, he ſaith only this, I ſaw you at the door
going unto <hi>Ireton's</hi> chamber, and ſaid, <hi>will you ſtrike Sayl,</hi> &amp;c.
Truly my Lord he doth not ſay, what, or how, or any thing
I meant; there muſt be according to Sir <hi>Edward Cook's</hi> 7th
Book of his <hi>Inſtitutes</hi> that Oracle of the Law: he ſaith, <hi>That
Evidence ought to he as clear as the Sun at noon day;</hi> All that
you can ſay is this; it muſt be a wide Inference, a large Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
I conceive there is nothing in theſe two witneſſes, and
if the two Priſoners were here, they would clear me in this.</p>

                  <speaker>Axtell.</speaker>
                  <p>Then my Lord, in the next place Col. <hi>Temple</hi> is pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to ſay, that the Lady <hi>Fairfax</hi> ſaying ſomething againſt the
Court (which in truth as I ſaid before, I know not who it was,
or what the words were) he ſaith, I bid Fire againſt them, I
did nothing but what I was commanded upon pain of Death
to preſerve peace, and in purſuance of that command from
the ſuperior Officers of the Army? ſilence was required, and
that was all that was done. I ſuppoſe where a man is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to keep ſilence, as the Sheriff is required to keep all
at peace in a Court; if he reſtrain a perſon that will not be
quiet, it is not Treaſon in him, nor in me in this particular.
My Lord, in the next place Mr. <hi>Temple</hi> is pleaſed to ſay, that
I ſtood upon the pavement laughing, while others ſighed;
Truly my Lord, I know not whether I ſaw the Gentleman or
no; certainly ſmiling is no Treaſon, if I did ſo, though I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
I had as great a ſenſe that day as many other perſons
there; this is the ſum of that he ſaith, only he further adds
that I bid the Souldiers cry for <hi>Juſtice,</hi> truly my Lord—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. ch. Bar.</speaker>
                  <p>Becauſe it may be your Notes are ſhort, I will
acquaint you there was a little more in it, he ſaid you bid the
Souldiers cry out, <hi>Juſtice, Juſtice;</hi> and they coming not very
readily to it, you ſtruck ſome of them till they with your ſelf
cryed out <hi>Juſtice, Juſtice,</hi> till they with your ſelf did it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Axt.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, To that I anſwer, that in the Hall there
was ſome kind of people did ſet up a crying ſome kind of
words, and may be ſome of the Souldiers might cry ſo too,
I might command them to hold their Tongues, and to ſay,
<hi>I'le teach you to cry Juſtice,</hi> and ſo the Gentleman ſtanding by,
might believe I was the perſon that bid them do it: Truly
my Lord, is this all that the Gentleman ſays, which I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
conceive is nothing, becauſe he does not ſay againſt any
perſon; and therefore my Lord, I do hold to that Maxim in
the Law, as Sir <hi>Edward Cooke</hi> holds (that man of great parts
of learning and knowledg) <hi>That in matters of Treaſon wherein
a man is the moſt highlieſt concern'd in his life and poſterity, there
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:56280:123"/>
ought not to be conſtrued againſt him Inferences or preſumptions, or
ſtrains of wit;</hi> there is no more in this, and this is all that I
ſay in this particular. In the next place, Mr. <hi>Temple</hi> is pleaſed
to ſay, that after the Court had ſentenced his Majeſty, he was
hurried away in a <hi>Cedan:</hi> Truly, whether he was or not I
know not, There was a Guard of Halbertiers, whereof Col.
<hi>Huncks</hi> was one, and ſeveral others as I have heard; they were
Select Guards of his Majeſty, Guarding him from St. <hi>Jame</hi>'s
to other places: how he came to be hurried I know not, it
was not by me: and whereas he ſay's, during the whole Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
I was there, truly I think I was there by command of my
General by Authority of the Lords and Commons.</p>

                  <p>No (my Lord) I ſaid not any ſuch word, or any thing
like it, I heard there was an Officer went up and intreated
her to be ſilent, I ſay it is the ſame with the former it is no
Treaſon to deſire one to be ſilent. My Lord, the next Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
that ſpeaks in Evidence againſt me is Mr. <hi>Young;</hi> he ſays
this, I bid the Souldiers cry for <hi>juſtice:</hi> it is very like that
perſon as well as Mr. <hi>Temple</hi> might ſee me in the croud ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to make the Souldiers quiet, I might repeat the words
that the people ſaid, repeat the word <hi>juſtice,</hi> or ſome ſuch
word, as the peoples words.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Ch. Bar.</speaker>
                  <p>Remember how he repeats them, he ſaw you
active in ſetting on the Souldiers to cry <hi>juſtice.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Axt.</speaker>
                  <p>If I have taken them right, one ſays he heard me ſay
ſuch words as <hi>juſtice,</hi> and that he ſaw me ſtrike two or three
Souldiers; if in the Tumult ſuch a word ſhould be ſtarted, I
hearing of them, I might ſtrike thoſe Souldiers that ſaid,
<hi>juſtice, juſtice,</hi> and might repeat the words, <hi>I'le give you juſtice,</hi>
and ſo ſtrike them, that is a good Evidence that it might be
a repetition of their words, and not any of mine own: They
both ſpeak as to the word <hi>juſtice,</hi> but here was not juſtice
mentioned to any perſon; I might repeat their own words,
and chaſtiſe them for thoſe words; beſides this, (though I
do not ſay the word was ſpoken by me,) if the word <hi>juſtice</hi>
had been ſpoken, my Lord I hope it is no Treaſon to ſay, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
juſtice, <hi>it is Gods great Attribute, it is God's Ordinance, and
that can be no Treaſon.</hi> I have read in Law Books, (though but
lately) and I cannot find that the word Juſtice ſhould be
made Treaſon, then there is no perſon to whom that
adjunct doth belong. The next Evidence, my Lord, is
Capt. <hi>Jeonar,</hi> he ſaith, I commanded a Guard; truly ſeveral
Regiments took their turns as they were commanded by the
General, and I as an inferior Officer was there, but that is
no more than what was ſaid before; it was done by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the General; if I had not done it, I had died by
the Law of War: He ſaith, there was a cry for Juſtice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I can
ſay nothing more than I have formerly ſaid, it may be in the
Tumult the Souldiers might ſay ſo, and I chaſtiſing of them,
and repeating that in my chaſtiſement, they might think they
were mine own words.</p>

                  <speaker>L. Ch. Bar.</speaker>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Axtell,</hi> I would help your memory, he
ſwears the laſt day you encouraged the Souldiers to cry <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
Execution.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>

                  <p>For that particular I am coming to it <hi>(I thank your
Lordſhip for helping me)</hi> My Lord, for that of Execution, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
I cannot ſay whether I was there that day or no; one day
I was commanded to be there with ſome Companies in <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter-Hall,</hi>
but whether I was there any more than that one
time, is the queſtion: Admit I was there that day, I was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
there but when I was commanded; when the Colonel
that commanded the Regiment was there, I as an inferior
Officer ought to be there: I was there by a ſpecial Order,
and not by a voluntary Act of mine own, and ſo it cannot be
<hi>Compaſſing the death of the King.</hi> For to the word <hi>Execution,</hi>
what can be the ſenſe of this word? <hi>Execution</hi> is a ſingle
word, thoſe people that ſtarted the word <hi>juſtice,</hi> might put
it in the heads of the Souldiers, which I might ſtrike to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
ſilence; they likewiſe might upon the ſame account cry
out <hi>Execution,</hi> and ſo to hinder all Tumults and Hubbubs
and the like in the place, I might repeat their words in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
of them for it, I might ſay, <hi>I'le juſtice you, I'le execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
you:</hi> But my Lord, this word <hi>Execution of juſtice,</hi> it is a
glorious word, not that there can be an inference that what
they did I ſhould ſay was Juſtice, or to approve of any thing
that they did, but only in general <hi>Execution of juſtice,</hi> which
my Lord, relates not to any perſon, poſſibly the rude people
might be ſpeaking (as hath been ſaid before) in that manner,
and the Souldiers might take it up, and I might reprove them
and make uſe of their own words by word of repetition <hi>I will
Juſtice you, I will Execution you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My Lord, in the next place, I do obſerve to ſpeak that of
Mr. <hi>Burden,</hi> he did obſerve to your Lordſhips and the Jury,
my Country-men my Brethren, with whom are the iſſues of
life and death, for whoſe life they muſt anſwer before the
Lord as to Righteouſneſs, Judgment, and Equity; I ſay my
Lord as to Mr. <hi>Burden,</hi> he tells you, that for my ſake, he was
impriſoned; ſaith he, <hi>I have ſuffered much by him,</hi> and ſpeaks
it with much indignation of ſpirit, I have ſuffered and been
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:56280:125"/>
impriſoned by him, and afterwards he comes to ſpeak his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence;
how much his Evidence may be of Force, I deſire
my Lord, the Jury may conſider of that; and then he comes
and ſaith, I commanded a Guard at the Banqueting-houſe in
<hi>Whitehall.</hi> Truly my Lord, the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> commanded a
Regiment to quarter there, and I as an inferior Officer might
be there: in the next place, my Lord, he ſaith, I ſent <hi>Aliſha
Axtell</hi> to fetch the Hang-man; Truly my Lord, I wonder this
perſon is come from <hi>Ireland,</hi> (if this were ſo) the Authority
there would not ſend that perſon with his great Evidence as
well as this perſon; he may as well charge any perſon with
this as me: It is evident, <hi>Ireton, Harriſon</hi> and <hi>Cromwell,</hi> they
did all amongſt themſelves; I never was with them, amongſt
them, received no command from them, nor obeyed them;
nor did any thing but what I had command for from the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
who by the Law, I was bound to obey as a Souldier. I
ſhall only obſerve one thing more; this perſon being ſo long
a Priſoner, to Extricate himſelf out of his impriſonment and
chains, poor man! he may ſay more than is true. I wonder he
ſhould ſay I ſent for the Executioner, I never knew of any
circumſtance touching conſultation about his Death, or took
him Priſoner. When they ſent to me to be one of his Gnard, I
never would go; I humbly conceive there is nothing ſticks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me in this, conſidering the circumſtances and the words of
he perſon that ſpoke them.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, the next perſon that ſpeaks againſt me, is Mr.
<hi>Cooke,</hi> and he ſaith he heard me ſay, <hi>Thruſt that Lady down
that made a diſturbance in the Court,</hi> or words to that purpoſe:
it is probable there might be a deſire of ſilence. The next
Evidence is Lt. Col. <hi>Nelſon,</hi> he ſaith that upon a Diſcourſe—</p>

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:56280:125"/>
never had a Key; poſſibly Col. <hi>Temple</hi> might come to me,
quartering there, and deſire me to ſpeak to ſome perſons that
had the charge of it to let him in, whether I did or no I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
remember, but if it were ſo, I hope it will not amount to
Treaſon. The laſt thing given in Evidence againſt me is Mr.
<hi>Nelſon,</hi> he ſaith that upon ſome diſcourſe between us, he was
asking what perſon cut off the Kings head, and that I ſhould
ſay <hi>Hewlet,</hi> &amp;c. Truly my Lord I was never privy, and I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to Mr. <hi>Ruſhworth</hi> if he were here, who was Secretary, if
ever he ſaw me in any Counſel, to adviſe, or Act, or any thing
in that kind in relation to the Kings Tryal, Sentence or Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution;
for me to know the perſon that was imployed about
the Execution, it is ſtrange when (as I ſaid before) they did
all within themſelves. I had no knowledg thereof, and med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
not with any thing, but within my own Sphear, as a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
under my L. <hi>Fairfax,</hi> by Authority of Parliament. For
naming of any perſon; truly my Lord it would be a wonder
to me that I ſhould name any perſon, to go to do any perſon
that wrong and injury to ſay he was the perſon, I muſt invent
it, for I knew nothing of it. But by common fame up and
down the City, it was ſaid to be another perſon, but who it
was I cannot ſay my Lord, but to all this that hath been ſaid
againſt me, there are but two things upon two Witneſſes that
are placed upon me, the Firſt my Lord here is two Witneſſes
for crying <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>Execution.</hi>

                  <p>There is three to that, I ſhall only ſay this to your

is committed to them either to acquit or condemn me, and
God knows the hearts of all men, and my innocency and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity,
I ſhall ſay nothing to the Witneſſes, it is a day of
Temptation; and I deſire the Jury my Countrymen, my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Citizens, my Brethren, that they would well conſider of
it, the word, <hi>Execution</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> admit I had ſaid them
(which my Lord I do not, I muſt not Grant) there being an
uprore of people, there ſuch words might be uſed, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:56280:126"/>
Souldiers might take them up from them, and chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the Souldiers I might repeat the words, <hi>I will Juſtice you,
I will Execution you.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Ch. Bar.</speaker>
                  <p>The Evidence is that you beat them becauſe
they did not readily cry <hi>Juſtice, Juſtice.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Axtel.</speaker>
                  <p>It might be more probable I beat them becauſe they
did do it, I might chaſtiſe them for doing of it, and repeat
it as a reaſon for their Chaſtiſement; and but admitting it
was true, which I grant not, yet I hope Juſtice and Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Juſtice, as it is ſo great an Attribute of God, by Gods
Laws nor Mans Laws is no where made Treaſon, but Mercy
attends it, and Judgment attends the contrary; I leave it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the conſciences of the Jury, to weigh it carefully how I
could be guilty of <hi>Compaſſing or Imagining the Death of the King,</hi>
when nothing is charged againſt me to be either of Counſel,
Sentencing, or Signing, or to be at the Execution, only one
man, as I told you before, he ſpoke ſomething wrathly, and
that he had ſuffered much, and therefore he is come over now,
and ſaith I ſhould ſend for the Executioner, which I never
knew of, or had any hand in ſending for, how much validity
that hath, I leave to the Jury, if it were ſo, it is not treaſon,
for words may make a Heretick, not a Traytor; I ſpeak that
by way of preface; I do humbly conceive that theſe being
only noted words, <hi>Execution</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> the King not ſo
much as named, nor any thing done to it by me, I ſay I
conceive it doth not amount to Treaſon by the Law; and
beſides, it is againſt the Law of the great Judg, the Judg
of Judges; all of us, that are now, and are to come ſhall
ſtand before him to receive our deſerts, I ſay it is againſt the
Law of God, <hi>to make me an Offender for a word;</hi> for a word,
I have heard the Judges ſay that the Laws of <hi>England</hi> are
grounded upon the Laws of God, and the Laws of <hi>England</hi>
are Laws of mercy, not of rigour: My Lord, if a man ſhall
be deſtroyed in his Life, in his Poſterity for a word (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the thing had been ſo) I leave upon the conſciences of
my Jury, before the preſence of Jeſus Chriſt, and before
whom they and I muſt come to be rejudged again at the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal;
and beſides it is only words, and words uncertain;
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:56280:126"/>
and Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> ſaith, he muſt declare plain truth in
matter of Treaſon, nothing muſt be taken for Evidence that
may be a preſumption or inference, or ſtrain of wit, I hope
upon this conſideration that the word Juſtice fixed upon me
by two Witneſſes may be taken up at ſecond or third hand
from the People or Souldiers by chaſtiſing them for the Tumult
Then my Lord in the next place theſe words were never put
in writing, and ſo not Treaſon; then, my Lord, there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
an overt act done by me; for that Act of Indemnity that
his Majeſty and both Houſes of Parliament paſſed, wherein
they were pleaſed the very laſt to except me, I wonder'd
when I came to be excepted of that number, I do come back
to the place where I left, and that is the overt act. My Lord,
I would only bring it in in this place, when I was excepted
by the Houſe of Commons, one of the twenty, I was except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thus not extending to life, I went up and down free at
noon day, I did not hide my ſelf, ingaging a perſon that was
one of his Majeſties Servants to do me a courteſie, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
me he would do it, and contrary to his promiſe he
was pleaſed to bring the Kings Warrant to carry me to the
Tower, and after that I came to be excepted with that black
Catalogue of excepted perſons, and to be brought to the
Tryal of the Law. Now (my Lord) I return to that overt
act as it was but words uncertain, and they may be words
repeated from the third or the fourth hand, for they were
not put in writing; according to that Act of Indemnity
which I underſtand the meaning of to be thus, That for their
Execrable Treaſons in Sentencing, Signing, or otherwiſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental,
they are excepted out of this Act, and to be Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
according to the Laws of this Nation; I underſtand that to
be Inſtrumental, to be Inſtrumentally the Executioner of the
King, I never had any hand in that. Upon the whole this is the
Fact that is proved by two Witneſſes, they heard me ſay
<hi>Juſtice and Execution,</hi> which muſt relate to the <hi>Execution of
Juſtice,</hi> which by the Law of God is not Treaſon, eſpecially
when there was not the word King; for a word to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
and deſtroy ſo many, my Life, Wife, Children and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Fatherleſs that are under the Charge of the Priſoner at the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:56280:127"/>
Bar is very ſad, the words I do not grant but upon ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities
as I have ſaid; I might repeat them, <hi>I will Juſtice
you, I will Execution you,</hi> and then the words were not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
I ſay as Sir <hi>Edw. Cook</hi> ſaid, they may make a Heretick
but not a Traytor, the other part of the Evidence is this, that
I was there with Souldiers at <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> I muſt ſay
if that be Treaſon to be guided by Judgment of Lords and
Commons in Parliament, I muſt ſay if that be Treaſon to
take up Arms for a Parliament upon ſuch Grounds and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
of the ſtatute which they have made and publiſhed
by their own Authority, if I am Guilty under the General,
then the Parliament would be guilty of Treaſon.</p>

                  <p>I thank your Lordſhips for informing me, but I was
commanded to be there by my General, if I had not gone I
muſt have dyed, I did only ſtand there for preſervation of
the peace, in no other ſenſe, if the General order me to be
at ſuch a Rendezvous, I muſt be there; if I diſobeyed he
would have condemned me by the Law of War. The next
thing againſt me material are theſe two things, that is that I
ſhould ſend one <hi>Eliſha Axtell</hi> for the Executioner, I muſt ſay
it is moſt Admirable ſuch things ſhould be laid to my charge,
I hope your Lordſhips and the Jury do obſerve, he told you
he ſuffered much, and a poor man under his extremities and
loſſes and ſufferings, perhaps might ſtart ſome unadviſed
words, and being now ſent over may aſcertain it. But doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
this <hi>Eliſha Axtell</hi> being in <hi>Ireland,</hi> if by command it had
been ſo, would have been ſent over, truly I muſt ſay I had
no hand in the buſineſs, it was left wholly to them amongſt
themſelves, and what ever was done, or whatever was ſaid,
it was ſaid and done by them, I never was acquainted with
any thing of that nature, he ſaid he heard I ſhould ſend <hi>Eliſha
Axtell</hi>
for an Executioner, if hearſays may be Treaſon it will
be a hard Leſſon; and my Lord, Sir <hi>Edw. Cooke</hi> ſaith there
muſt be two witneſſes, here is but one. It comes from ſuch
a man, my Lord as the providence of God, but I will ſay no
more as to that, but pray the Jury will take notice of it.</p>

a free and General Pardon to all our Subjects of what degree or
quality whatſoever, who within Four days after the publiſhing

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Axtell,</hi> I would not interrupt you to that,
but this very Objection was made by one of the Priſoners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
this anſwer was given; Firſt the King's Declaration is
not a Pardon in point of Law, it muſt be under the Broad-Seal;
but God forbid but it ſhould bind in honour. You in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced
in the word Parliament, what was meant by the word
Parliament: you muſt know this, the exigency of the Times
were ſuch, that there were many Noble Perſons that took
the advantage to Aſſemble themſelves together to reinſtate
the King; they did that which was juſt and lawful, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the exigency of the Times: This Declaration he ſent
to the two Houſes, he called them His Two Houſes, ſo that
it appears clearly and manifeſtly, they were then ſitting, they
being accepted by the King, and owned by Him; and they
did ſit in way of Convention, according as a Parliament, and
his Majeſty ſent his Letter to them; and theſe are the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that have thought fit to except you out of that Act.</p>

benefit within the time, but you may remember that it was
referred to thoſe two Houſes of Parliament, they were to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
who was fit for the Pardon, and you are by them Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
out by Name: Your queſtion now is no more, but
<hi>whether guilty or not guilty,</hi> and theſe are but extravagant Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes

                  <p>I hope you will pardon me, my Lord, I hope I
have ſpoken to clear the Point; The Fact charged by your
Lordſhips and before the Jury; and I hope the Lord will
give the Jury a Memory of it, and a right Underſtanding in
what I have ſaid for my own Defence. My Lord, the next
thing I have to offer, is this, to Expound that Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that it was the intention of his Majeſty and Parliament,
that all ſhould be excepted but thoſe guilty of Councelling,
Signing or Sentencing. Truly my Lord, I humbly conceive,
I being none of thoſe, am not guilty of Treaſon. I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſpeak one word to my Jury, That they will remember what
I have ſaid, that there is but two things, two Witneſſes, as
to <hi>Juſtice and Execution,</hi> that it relates to no perſon but in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral;
and then I do not own the things, but poſſibly they
might hear ſuch words, I taking of them up upon a rebound,
reproved the Souldiers; for the other that I ſhould ſend one
for the Executioner (he heard ſo) and that I ſhould name
who was the Executioner, I would not have that perſon or
any other to ſuffer for that.</p>

I never heard it before that words were Treaſon. In Queen

                  <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, There hath been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:56280:128"/>
things offered by the Priſoner at the Bar, as near as my
Memory will give me leave in ſo long a Diſcourſe. I ſhall
repeat all things which he ſaith for himſelf, and which are
ſaid againſt him. There are ſome things that he ſeems to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
as tending to matter of Law, and ſomething meerly of
Fact, proper only for you of the Jury. For matter of Law,
he hath urged ſeveral things for himſelf, not by way of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of the Fact, (I muſt do him that right,) but in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
of himſelf, and I hope his conſcience hath ſo wrought
upon him, that he is of opinion, the Fact was a horrid Fact,
which was ſo indeed.</p>
                  <p>For that which he hath ſaid for himſelf; Firſt, he doth
alledge to have his Commiſſion from the Lord <hi>Fairfax:</hi> My
Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> had his Commiſſion from the two Houſes of
Parliament, and this Gentlemans was in <hi>March</hi> the beginning
of the year 1648. he ſaith what he did was in obedience to
his ſuperiors, as a Soldier; that he never conſulted or advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
about any thing of the Tryal or execution of his Majeſty.
For this point it hath already been ſpoken to Gentlemen, for
that which hath been ſpoken to at large heretofore I muſt
repeat it here that he may know it, That no Perſon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
no Community, not the people either collectively or
repreſentatively have any coercive Power over the King, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> his General, not he, nor any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
could be excuſed for this horrid Fact of bringing the King
to Trial, No perſon, as I ſaid before, nor Community have
any ſuch power. The Law-books which he hath lately ſeen
(and truly he hath imployed his time well in that) the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>books
tell us, that whereas the two <hi>Spenceers</hi> had broached a
damnable and deteſtable principle, that the homage was only
due to the King in reſpect to his Crown, that if he did not
demean himſelf according to ſuch and ſuch rules his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
might rule him <hi>per aſpertee</hi> by aſperity and ſharpneſs;
but this was condemned by two Acts of Parliament, they
both appear in my L. <hi>Cooke</hi> in <hi>Calvins</hi> caſe. I do not go to
repeat all the evidence that might clear this truth, I ſay, had
there been any ſuch thing, but it hath been told him there
was no ſuch thing in Fact. My Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi>'s Commiſſion
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:56280:129"/>
was for the preſervation of the King, as well as for the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the People. The 11. of <hi>Rich. 2. Robert de Vere</hi> and
others for levying a War was puniſhed, but this Gent. was
not charged for levying of War. If either of the Houſes of
Parliament ſhould command ſuch a thing as tends to the death
of the King it would be void in it ſelf. Something he let
fall of the Parliament not being diſſolved. My Maſters, for
that you have heard ſome of my Lords declare how and in
what manner this was an Authority of Parliament, but it
was clearly nothing at all, this Gentlemen goes by Vertue of
a Power from the Lord <hi>Fairfax.</hi> The next thing he urges
in point of Law was this, he comes by way of Dilemma, ſaith
he, either I muſt obey my General or dye by the Law of War.
He goes further, and urges the ſtatute of 11. <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. He
comes further and ſaith in the 25. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. that concerns ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
perſons, truly it concerns every man. The Indictment
you ſee how it is laid, <hi>It is for Imagining and Compaſſing the
Death of the King.</hi> The overtacts in the Indictment you have
heard what they are, there muſt be more than one Witneſs
for Treaſon. It is very true, but if one perſon prove one
thing, another perſon another, if one ſwear he did cry <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
Juſtice, Execution, Execution,</hi> and another ſwear ſome
other part, Gentlemen this was here before delivered to you
for an overtact. It is any thing that opens and makes it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to the Jury that he did do the things for which he is
Indicted, I ſay any one of theſe that they did meet together,
and did conſult in order to the putting the King to Death.
That they did meet in a Trayterous Aſſembly about the Kings
Death I ſhall ſay no more, you need not I think go from
the Bar.</p>

                     <p>My Lords and Gentlemen of this Jury,
<hi>Francis Hacker,</hi> the Priſoner at the Bar, ſtands indicted, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
others, for Compaſſing and Imagining the death of
the late King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt of happy Memory. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing
and Imagining is the Treaſon it ſelf; the other points,
as <hi>Convening, Aſſembling, Meeting together,</hi> and the actual vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany
that followed all theſe are but as Evidences of that Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.
As to this perſon at the Bar our Evidence will be
thus. We ſhall make it appear to you, that he was one of
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:56280:130"/>
the perſons that were upon the Guard, and kept the King a
Priſoner, that he might be ſure to be brought to that <hi>Mock
Court of Injuſtice.</hi> Then it will appear to you, That this Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
at the Bar was highly truſted by all thoſe Miſcreants
that thirſted for the Kings blood, by their bloody Warrant
directed to him and others, to take the Kings perſon into
cuſtody, and to ſee Execution done. This was the perſon
that kept him till he brought him to that fatal Stage. That
this Warrant was lately brought from his own houſe by his
own Wife to the Houſe of Lords, and then we ſhall ſhew
you that this perſon ſet his hand to the Warrant to the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner
for Execution. That he did not do it ignorantly
nor unwillingly, for he heard the Warrant read: we ſhall
make it appear that he was upon the Scaffold, and had the
Ax in his hand.</p>

                     <speaker>Tomlinſon.</speaker>
                     <p>My Lords and Gentlemen of this Jury, I ſhall
as my memory enables me, make a faithful Narrative of this
buſineſs: I had indeed to do with the Guard, that had to
do with the perſon of the King about St. <hi>Jameſes.</hi> Being
then an Officer of the Army, a Colonel of Horſe, when the
King came to St. <hi>Jameſes:</hi> it was obſerved by ſome, that
there was too great an acceſs of people admitted to the King,
and within one day or two after, there was a party of Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berteers
appointed for the ſtricter obſerving the Guard; they
were commanded by three Gentlemen, of whom this Priſoner
at the Bar was one; the orders every day for removing
the perſon of the King were commonly directed to four per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and thoſe were my ſelf, Lieu. Col. <hi>Cobbet,</hi> Capt. <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryman,</hi>
and one more: but the Guards that ſtill went along
were the Halberteers. So that every day when the King did
go to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> he went to Sir <hi>Robert Cottons</hi> Houſe, and
ſo far I went with him, and no farther. I never went with
him nor ſaw him at that pretended High Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.
When he uſed to go to the High Court of Juſtice,
commonly (every time indeed) the Serjeant, Serjeant, <hi>Dendy</hi>
(as I remember his name was) he uſed to come and demand,
that the King ſhould go to the High Court of Juſtice, and
Col. <hi>Hacker</hi> did ordinarily go with him, with the Halber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers.
It was my cuſtom to ſtay in the room till he came back
again: theſe Orders continued, during the time of his Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.
After the Sentence was given, on the day whereon the
Execution was to be done, it was ordered which order may
be produced if ſignificant) that the Guards that were for the
ſecurity of the person of the King ſhould ceaſe, when a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
from the High Court of Juſtice for the Execution ſhould
be produced: I would not omit any thing that I well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and this I remember, that the night before the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the King called me into his Chamber and told me ſeveral
things; I will take the occaſion to trouble you with a ſhort
diſcourſe of it, he told me of ſome Legacies he had given, he
told me he had prepared ſomething that he would ſpeak the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:56280:131"/>
next day, and in the cloſe of it he deſired me, that I would
not leave him (for I ſpeak it in truth) there were many times
ſeveral incivilities offered to him, and though I was upon a
duty, that was of a harſh and unpleaſing nature to me, and
did deſire ſeveral times to be releaſed from it, (as I believe is
well known to ſome) yet I did not admit any time that any
incivility ſhould be offered to him; people would take To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco
before him, and keep their hats on before him, I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
checked them for it; he was pleaſed to have a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of that care, that I had in that capacity I then ſtood.
That very night before his death he was pleaſed to give me
a Legacy, which was a gold Tooth-picker and Caſe, that he
kept in his pocket. The next day when the Warrant came,
the Guard of Halberteers went with him through St. <hi>Jameſes</hi>
Park, I was preſent walking near the King, the Biſhop of
<hi>London</hi> (now of <hi>Canterbury)</hi> was with him and ſome others.
As we were going thorough the Park, he was pleaſed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
ſomething of what he had been diſcourſing before
touching his Burial, he wiſhed that the Duke of <hi>Richmond</hi> and
ſome others that he ſhould bring ſhould take care of it. That
morning in the Park, he told me he had been thinking of what
he had ſaid the night before. He told me he had ſome
thoughts that his Son might come to bury him, and deſired
he might not ſuddenly be buried; I gave him aſſurance I
would communicate his deſire, and ſo I did: when he came
to <hi>Whitehall</hi> he went into a room in the Gallery (I know not
the name) the Guard ſtood in the outer room there. There
was a Gentleman that came to me there, and told me he was
endeavouring to preſent a Letter from the Prince to the
King, and told me he could not get an opportunity, I ſaid
he ſhould not want an opportunity if I could help him; it
was Mr. <hi>Henry Seymor;</hi> it was delivered and the King read
it, and he gave ſeveral things in charge to Mr. <hi>Seymor</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quant
the Prince with, and was pleaſed to mention to him,
ſomething of civility that I had ſhewn him in his impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the effect and fruit of it I find, and do moſt humbly
acknowledg before all the world my thanks to his moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Majeſty the King, and to the Lords and Commons.
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:56280:131"/>
After Mr. <hi>Seymor</hi> was gone from him, (I do not well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the time, whether it was twelve, one, or two a clock,)
Col. <hi>Hacker</hi> came in, and there was preſent with him the
two other Gentlemen that were named in the Warrant (as
I remember) I am ſure Col. <hi>Hacker</hi> (if my memory fail me
not) did produce the Warrant. My ſelf and thoſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that were concerned in the former Orders looked upon
this Warrant; by which the Orders which he had were at
the end. I muſt confeſs I did not, nor none of thoſe did tell
him that the Orders for ſecurity of his perſon were at an
end, but Col. <hi>Hacker</hi> did go in to him, and after a little while
Col. <hi>Hacker</hi> comes to the door, and the King was coming
forth, and he told me that the King deſired I ſhould go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with him; and indeed the night before when the King
told me that he had prepared ſomething to ſpeak, he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
I would not leave him. So Col. <hi>Hacker</hi> led him forth,
the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> followed him, and I followed the Biſhop
of <hi>London,</hi> the Guards were prepared without, and they
went on to the Scaffold, when we came to the Scaffold I
went ſo far as to the entrance upon it, the King was upon
it, and had looked a little while about it, and was thinking
to have ſpoken over, but he turned about to me, and began
to direct his ſpeech to me. I cannot trouble you with what
the King ſaid, for I cannot remember it, but that Colonel
<hi>Hacker</hi> was there in proſecution of that Warrant, and upon
that Warrant our Orders were at an end I do aver.</p>

himſelf to me, commanding me by vertue of that
Warrant, to draw up an Order for the Executioner; I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
it, and upon refuſing of it there hapned ſome croſs
paſſages. <hi>Cromwel</hi> would have no delay. There was a little
Table that ſtood by the door, and pen, ink and paper being

done writing, he gives the pen over to <hi>Hacker, Hacker</hi> he
ſtoops and did write (I cannot ſay what he writ,) away

                     <speaker>Mr. <hi>Secretary.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>When Col. <hi>Huncks</hi> (for that title he now aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes)
was brought over out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and committed to
the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> there was three of the Council, by
order of the Board, ſent to examin him, Sir <hi>Anthony Aſhly-Cooper,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Anneſly</hi> and my ſelf: In obedience to that order,
we repaired to the Tower, and had Col. <hi>Huncks</hi> brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us, we told him, that he (being one of thoſe which was
appointed by warant from the ſuppoſititious high Court of
Juſtice, to carry on the Execution of the King, and ſee it
done) muſt needs know who was the Executioner: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
he anſwered, that he for his part did not know who was
the Executioner; for the Warrant whereby the Executioner
was nominated &amp; appointed, was refuſed to be ſigned by him,
but Col. <hi>Hacker</hi> ſigned it, and therefore Col. <hi>Hacker</hi> muſt know
it. Accordingly upon our return we made our Report to the
Board, and upon this there was an Order, that Col. <hi>Hacker</hi>
ſhould be ſent for, taken into Cuſtody, and brought before the
Lords of the Council: Accordingly he was apprehended, and
the ſame three Councellors were ſent down to examin him.
We took him into a private room, and examined him, and
told him (amongſt other things) that he being the man that
(as we are informed) did ſign the Warrant, for the nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating
and appointing the Executioner, doubtleſs he muſt
needs know who that was, at firſt he ſaid he did not ſign this
Warrant: I told him, I would have him well adviſed what
he ſaid; for if you deny it, it will be proved by ſuch a
man, naming Col. <hi>Huncks,</hi> and that you will do your ſelf
a great prejudice if you deny that; ſaith he, <hi>I do believe I did
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:56280:133"/>
ſign the Warrant for appointing the Executioner,</hi> that is all I can
ſay.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. Anneſly.</speaker>
                     <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, it is very true as you
have been told already, that I was amongſt thoſe that the
Council ſent, to the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> firſt to examine Col.
<hi>Huncks</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> that hath been condemned, <hi>Hulet</hi> and
ſome other Priſoners. We did examin Colonel <hi>Huncks,</hi> and
he did by his Examination acquit himſelf from ſigning that
Warrant that he was charged with, being one of the three
appointed to ſee execution done, but they appointed another
to ſign the Warrant (Col. <hi>Huncks</hi> refuſing) and upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal
(as he ſaid) <hi>Cromwel</hi> that urged him to it, ſaid he was
a cowardly fellow, or ſomething to that purpoſe: when we
examined him about the perſon in the <hi>Frock,</hi> he ſaid he
knew nothing of that, but that Col. <hi>Hacker</hi> ſigned that War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
for Execution; this Examination being reported to the
Council, the Lords ſent for <hi>Hacker.</hi> I think upon notice Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
<hi>Hacker</hi> came, he had been of the Army, and continued
till that time an Officer: when he came thither, the Lords
of the Council having notice of it, commanded the ſame
perſons formerly appointed, to go out and examine him;
we had him into a little room belonging to the Clerks of the
Council, and examined him to that point concerning the
Man that cut off the Kings head, whether he knew any
thing of it: he did affirm poſitively he did not know; we
told him that he was the man, by teſtimony, that ſigned a
Warrant for Execution of the King, and then certainly he
muſt know the perſon that he appointed by his Warrant;
he ſaid, if I did ſign any Warrant, it was by command of
the General, that being but hypothetical, we thought it
meet to make it more poſitive, whereupon we asked him
whether he was the Man that ſigned the Warrant or no.
Thereupon (as I remember, and as the Examination which
was all written with mine own hand doth help my memory)
he did ſay he did believe he did ſign ſuch a Warrant; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he was aſked further, how could it be poſſible, that
he could forget the man if he ſigned the Warrant, he knew
who the man was that was appointed, he ſaid for that, that
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:56280:133"/>
he did believe the Warrant was read to him, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the mans name might be, but he could not now remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
his name, this was the effect of his Examination and
Confeſſion.</p>

                     <speaker>Francis.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, I did ſee him as a principal Commander there,
I was coming out of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> into <hi>London,</hi> about half an
hour before the King came upon the Scaffold; coming near
the Scaffold, as ſoon as I was engaged in the throng, (when
I had paſſed about eight or ten yards,) I could not paſs
backward nor forward; I was inforced to ſtand there: du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that time, I ſaw the Scaffold and the Ax, and the Block
taken up by divers people, and principally I ſaw a man that is
not here, he is in cuſtody, I ſaw him take it up, and try it with
his Thumb, and lay it down, this was <hi>James Berry,</hi> he came
off, and came not upon the Scaffold again unleſs diſguiſed.</p>

                     <speaker>Francis,</speaker>
                     <p>I did ſee him, he was there, his Majeſty came to
the ſide of the Scaffold next to St. <hi>Jameſes;</hi> he looked that
way and ſmiled, after a while the block and Ax lying down
about the middle of the Scaffold, there was a black Cloath
hung about the rails of the Scaffold.</p>

                     <p>We have another Evidence, the Priſoner hath
confeſſed enough, but we have proved that he had the King
in cuſtody, he confeſſed that he believed he did ſign the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
and that he at the time of Execution was there to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage

                     <p>Truly my Lord, I have no more to ſay for my ſelf,

whether I read this Warrant or no.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. ch. B.</speaker>
                     <p>This is all you have to ſay for your ſelf?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Hacker.</speaker>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. ch. B.</speaker>
                     <p>Then Col. <hi>Hacker,</hi> for that which you ſay for
your ſelf, that you did it by coommand, you muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
that no power on earth could Authorize ſuch a thing,
No command in ſuch a caſe can excuſe you. There is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
obedience, a paſſive obedience, to ſuffer, rather than do
things unlawful, and an Active obedience, to do that only
which is lawful: and therefore this will not excuſe your
obedience to thoſe unlawful commands.—Gent. of the Jury
you ſee the Priſoner at the Bar ſtands indicted for <hi>compaſſing</hi>
and <hi>imagining.</hi> the death of the late King, and there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
open Acts ſet forth in the indictment which tend to
prove that matter: one is aſſembling and meeting together,
another is ſitting upon the King, another ſentencing, and at
laſt concludes with the murther of the King, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
of all. Any thing that tends to the proving of
this compaſſing and imagining his death, in any one of theſe
particulars, that is an evidence to you to prove the whole
indictment. This Gentleman was Commander of Halber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers,
Col. <hi>Tomlinſon</hi> ſaith, that though he kept the Guards
that were about the Kings perſon, this Gentleman with two
other perſons, brought Halberteers, that there might not be
ſuch frequent acceſs as formerly to the King, there is one
Act. He commands theſe Halberteers at that time when
the buſineſs was in agitation, before that High Court, as
they called it. You ſee after the ſentence was given, that
he was one of the perſons to whom the Warrant for Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
was directed, you ſee afterwards there was a conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together, <hi>Cromwel, Ireton, Harriſon,</hi> and <hi>Axtel,</hi> were in
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:56280:134"/>
the Chamber, when Col. <hi>Huncks</hi> refuſed to ſign: the priſoner
ſigned the Warrant, but knows not the perſon, to whom it
was directed: you ſee beſides, Col. <hi>Tomlinſon</hi>'s teſtimony, who
ſaith further, that when they were diſcharged, Col. <hi>Hacker</hi>
went in and the King was brought out preſently after to
that fatal place. Col. <hi>Huncks</hi> ſwears, that when that War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
was offered to him he refuſed it, that <hi>Hacker</hi> the Priſoner
at the Bar, ſigned a Warrant, though he doth not remember
the name of the perſon to whom; it appears by two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
(honourable perſons) he confeſſed he ſigned it, but he
did not know the perſon to whom directed. You ſee ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Witneſs, <hi>Benjamin Francis,</hi> he ſaith he ſaw <hi>Hacker</hi> upon
the Scaffold with the King.</p>
                     <p>He doth not deny the fact, you need go no further, it is
very plain he had a hand in this buſineſs, a principal agent
in it, he that brought the King to the Scaffold, he that had
the care in managing that buſineſs, he that ſigned the Warrant
to the Executioner, either he is guilty of compaſſing the
death of the King, or no man can be ſaid to be guilty.</p>
                     <stage>The Jury went together, and after ſome little conſultation,
returned to their places.</stage>

Gentlemen that are ſworn of this Jury, we are now enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the laſt Act in this ſad tragedy of the Murther of
the late King, there have been before you ſome of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
the Councel, the Chaplain, and the Guard, this Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:56280:135"/>
at the Bar, in the laſt place was one of thoſe which
came with a frock on his body, and a vizor on his face to do
the work. The courſe of our evidence will be this, firſt we
ſhall prove by witneſſes that ſaw him, and knew him, that
he was thus diſguiſed: he hath confeſt that he was upon the
Scaffold, that he hath had ſeveral preferments, and I fear it
will appear that it was he that gave that fatal blow, for he
hath confeſſed he had an hundred pounds given him for his
ſervice therein, and we doubt not, but to pluck off his vizor
by and by. The indictment is for compaſſing and imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the death of his late Majeſty of glorious memory; if we
prove to you any circumſtantial <hi>overtact,</hi> whereby you ſhall be
convinced of this, you are to find him guilty.</p>

                  <p>The thing is this my Lord, this Gentleman at the
Bar and my ſelf were both in a Regiment in one company as
Serjeants, about twelve or thirteen years together. About a
day or two before the King came to the Scaffold, Colonel
<hi>Hewſon</hi> did give notice to a Lieutenant, that we ſhould come
to him, about 38 of us; and he put us all to our Oaths, that
we ſhould ſay nothing of what they did; he ſwore us to the
book; after he had ſworn us, he asked us if we would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
to do ſuch an Act, if we would, we ſhould have an
hundred pounds down, and preferment in the Army as long
as that ſtood, and the Parliament. Afterwards we refuſed
every perſon, we thought Captain <hi>Hulet</hi> did refuſe: after all
refuſed, it ſeems, he did undertake to do the deed. When
the King was brought on the Scaffold, we were in <hi>Scotland
yard,</hi> and they were upon the Guard in the Banqueting-Chamber:
when they were there I laid down my Arms and
got into the company; Captain <hi>Webb</hi> kept the Guard, with
his Halbert in his hand, by the Scaffold, and I did buſtle to
come near to them; then I returned back. <hi>Hulet</hi> (as far as
I can gueſs) when the King came on the Scaffold for his
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:56280:136"/>
execution, and ſaid, Executioner is the block faſt? then he
fell upon his knees.</p>

                  <p>I ſhall firſt give your Lordſhips and the Jury
what I have heard others ſay concerning the priſoner at the
bar, and that is firſt Colonel <hi>Hewſon:</hi> I was in the year 1650.
about <hi>September,</hi> in <hi>Dublin</hi> Caſtle, about ſome buſineſs with
<hi>Hewſon,</hi> Captain <hi>Hulet</hi> the priſoner at the bar, came into the
room, he talked with Colonel <hi>Hewſon</hi> a little while, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
them very familiar, and I asked <hi>Hewſon</hi> what he was
he told me he was his Captain Lieutenant of Horſe, I deſire
to know where he had him, he told me he made him ſo
from a Serjeant, and a very mettled fellow he was, it was,
he that did the Kings buſineſs for him upon the Scaffold.
In the year 1653. there was a disbanding of the Army in
<hi>Ireland,</hi> this Gentleman was then continued Captain Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
in <hi>Pretties</hi> Regiment, I diſcourſed with <hi>Pretty</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
him, and one part of it I remember, was about the
Kings death, and he did tell me that he was aſſured by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
<hi>Hewſon,</hi> that <hi>Hulet</hi> either cut off the Kings head or
held it up, and ſaid, <hi>behold the head of a Traytor:</hi> Colonel
<hi>Pretty</hi> would not tell me which of the two it was, but I
ſaw the perſon that did it, and me thought he did reſemble
this perſon. About 12. moneths after I came to live near the
priſoner in <hi>Ireland,</hi> once I remember at one Mr. <hi>Smiths</hi> at
the White-horſe in <hi>Carlow,</hi> I met him there, and I was ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the priſoner at the bar the queſtion, whether he was
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:56280:137"/>
the man that cut off the Kings head or not, ſaith he,
why do you ask me this queſtion? I told him I had heard
by ſeveral, namely by <hi>Hewſon</hi> and <hi>Pretty,</hi> upon that he ſaid,
well, <hi>what I did I will not be aſhamed of; if it were to do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
I would do it;</hi> once ſince that time, about half a year
afterwards, I was in the ſame place, and there talking
with him about the Kings death, he was telling me it was
true, he was one of the two perſons that was <hi>diſguiſed</hi> upon
the Scaffold. I deſired to know, what if the King had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
to ſubmit to the block? ſaith he, there were <hi>ſtaples</hi>
placed about the Scaffold, and I had that about me that
would have <hi>compelled</hi> him, or words to that effect; other
times I have heard him ſpeak ſomething to this. <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
the laſt in the the Queens County at <hi>Maryborough,</hi> Col.
<hi>Jones</hi> took upon him to be Governour, and to chooſe two
out of a Regiment that might be the Rulers of the people,
Legiſlators, I think they call'd them, I did diſcourſe about
the buſineſs again, and did oppoſe it all: after a while he
began to be very hot in the buſineſs about <hi>Lambert:</hi> ſaid I,
you were heretofore too forward; ſayes he, if it be the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
of the Kings head, I will never deny it, call me to an
account when you will: I have obſerved in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that it
hath been generally reported, that he was either the man
that cut off the Kings Head, or that held it up, as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and I have heard them ſometimes call him <hi>Grandſire
Grey-beard.</hi>

well, we were in a Regiment together, I never diſcourſed
with any concerning this, but only once at a place going
from <hi>Cullen</hi> to <hi>Munſter,</hi> we did drink at a place called <hi>Goran;</hi>
we were diſcourſing about the buſineſs of the King, the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of the cutting off his head; ſaith <hi>Stammers,</hi> I did hear
that you were one of the perſons for that purpoſe; ſaid I,
they that ſay ſo do me wrong: ſaith he, it is no matter if
you were ſo; for it was a juſt act: ſaid I, whether it was or
no, I have nothing to do to juſtifie it, he was ſpeaking as I
hope to be ſaved I would have done it.</p>

called for a pint of wine, and I called for another; before
we had drank out the laſt pint of wine, ſaid I to Captain
<hi>Hulet,</hi> I pray reſolve me this one queſtion, it is reported that
you took up the Kings head, and ſaid, behold the head of
a Traytor; Sir, ſaid he, it was a queſtion I never reſolved
any man, though often demanded, yet ſaith he, whoſoever
ſaid it then it matters not, I ſay it now, it was the head of

                  <p>My Lords and Gentlemen of the Jury, as to the
Priſoner at the bar, he was very active in that horrid act,
there was two of them had both clothes alike, their frocks
were cloſe to their bodies (as I remember) they were rather
in Butchers habits of woollen, one had a black hat on his
head cockt up, and a black beard, and the other had a grey
griſled periwig hung down very low, I affirm, that he that
cut off the Kings head was he in the gray periwig, and I
beleeve this was about that mans ſtature <hi>(pointing to Mr.</hi> Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let)
and his beard was of the ſame colour, if he had any.

he gave one of the Souldiers a half Crown, ſaith the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
Waterman away with him, be gone quickly; but I
fearing this Hangman had cut off the Kings Head, I
trembled that he ſhould come into my Boat, but dared not

to examine him on ſhore for fear of the Souldiers, ſo out I
lanched, and having got a little way in the water, ſaid I, who

why? I directed my ſpeech to him ſaying, are you the Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that cut off the Kings Head? No as I am a ſinner to
God ſaith he, not I, he ſhook every joynt of him, I knew
not what to do; I rowed away a little further and fell to a
new examination of him, when I had got him a little further:
tell me true ſaid I, are you the Hangman that hath cut off
the Kings Head? I cannot carry you ſaid I, no ſaith he, I
was fetcht with a troop of Horſe, and I was kept a cloſe
priſoner at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and truly I did not do it, I was kept a
cloſe priſoner all the while, but they had my inſtruments. I

by Law: The Jury hath been charged, and evidence given,
all thoſe Witneſſes have been examined that we could hear

It was here ſaid, and given in Evidence, that <hi>Axtell</hi> did
ſend a Boat to fetch the common Hangman, if we knew
more that might tend to your advantage it ſhould be repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
You Gentlemen of the Jury, mark it? There is firſt
<hi>Gittens,</hi> he ſwears that he was in the ſame Regiment that
you were in, twelve or thirteen years together, he ſaith that
he and others were called together upon their Oaths, and
you amongſt the reſt, and there was an Oath of ſecrecy,
asking them if they would do ſuch an Act, they all refuſed
to do it, ſo did you: but he ſaid, the day of Execution of
the King this <hi>Gittens</hi> got among them, and one Captain
<hi>Web</hi> kept the door, and he ſaw you fall before the King, and
ask the King forgiveneſs, he ſaid he heard your voice, and
ſo knew you: and that the day after Captain <hi>Atkins</hi> ſaid, you
ſhall ſee <hi>Hulet</hi> ſhortly come to preferment, and he ſaith he did
not ſee you in the Regiment that day, and that <hi>Hewſon</hi> and
all the Regiment uſed to call you <hi>Father Gray-beard. Stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi>
he ſaith, that you was Capt. Lieutenant to Col. <hi>Hewſons</hi>
Troop, and you coming to <hi>Lutterels</hi> town, you asked him
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:56280:141"/>
ſeveral particulars, whether he had been in the Kings Army,
walking up and down you ſaid, you were the man behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
King <hi>Charles,</hi> and for that you had one hundred pounds;
this he ſwears poſitively. <hi>Samſon Toogood</hi> he ſwears, he ſaw
you come to Col. <hi>Hewſons</hi> in 1650. you talked to him very
familiarly; when you were gone he asked who you were, he
told him you were a Captain Lieutenant of Horſe, and he
ſaid, that you were a very mettled fellow, and did the Kings
buſineſs upon the Scaffold: that afterwards, Col. <hi>Hewſons</hi>
Regiment being diſcharged, you came to be of <hi>Pretty</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment,
and that he told this Gentleman, that he was aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by Colonel <hi>Hewſon,</hi> that it was you, that either cut off
the Kings head, or took it up and ſaid, <hi>Behold the head of a
Traytor.</hi> He ſaith afterwards, that in 1654. in <hi>Carloe,</hi> he
asked you the ſame queſtion, and you demanded of him who
told him? He anſwered he was told by ſeveral perſons,
namely <hi>Hewſon</hi> and <hi>Pretty.</hi> You ſaid, what I did I will not
be aſhamed of, and if it were to do, I would do it again. He
ſays again at another time, that you were one of the two
perſons who were then upon the Scaffold, and that there
were ſtaples to enforce the King to ſubmit, if he ſtrugled.
<hi>I had that about me which would have done the buſineſs.</hi> And
he ſays, in <hi>November</hi> laſt you came to a meeting upon a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
of Colonel <hi>Jones,</hi> and then did avouch <hi>Lamberts</hi> quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
he ſaid you were too forward heretofore: you ſaid, if
it be the buſineſs of the Kings head, I will never deny it,
call me to an account when you wil. He heard many call
you <hi>Grandſire Gray-beard.</hi> Then there is another Witneſs,
I think his name is <hi>Davies,</hi> he was in diſcourſe with you,
drinking two pints of Wine; It is reported (ſays he) you
took up the Kings head, and ſaid, <hi>Behold the head of a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor:</hi>
and he deſired you to reſolve him whether it was ſo or
no: you ſaid again, it had been demanded often: but you
never reſolved any man: you ſaid, whoſoever ſaid it then, I
ſay now, <hi>It was the head of a Traytor. Nelſon</hi> he ſwears, that
about ſix years ſince he was in diſcourſe with <hi>Axtell</hi> about
it, and <hi>Axtell</hi> told him they were a couple of ſtout men to
your knowledg (ſpeaking to <hi>Nelſon)</hi> I was one to do in
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:56280:141"/>
that affair: we made choice of two, <hi>Walker,</hi> and <hi>Hulet,</hi>
who gave the Blow? <hi>Walker,</hi> but <hi>Hulet</hi> took up the head.
Colonel <hi>Tomlinſon</hi> he ſays, that there were two on the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold,
one that had a gray-beard, and the other ſomewhat
flaxen. <hi>Nelſon</hi> alſo heard by Colonel <hi>Pretty</hi> that you did
it: and then <hi>Ben. Francis</hi> he ſays, they had both Frocks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
one a black beard, one a gray griſled periwig, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
he was about your ſtature. This is the ſubſtance of
what the witneſſes have ſaid againſt you; Gentlemen you
hear what has been proved on behalf of the Priſoner, that
is, if you believe the Witneſſes that are not upon Oath, that
<hi>Brandon</hi> confeſſed it, and denyed he did it, ſeveral Witneſſes
that ſay <hi>Brandon</hi> confeſſed he did it, and that he told them
of a ſum of Money that was given him. Gentlemen of the
Jury, you ſee the whole point in this caſe, the Indictment
is for Compaſſing and Imagining the death of his late Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty;
the Evidence goes two ways, part of the Witneſſes
one way, part another way, if you believe either of them,
then you ought to find that the defendent is guilty: if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he was in the Frock, though he was not the man that
did it, or if you find he did it, it is a clear teſtimony of his
Imagining and Compaſſing the death of the King. Now
it reſts upon you to conſider the Evidence that is given for
the Common Hangman, that he ſhould be the man that did
it: that the Priſoner at the Bar did not cut off the head;
on the other ſide, if you do believe he was one of the two
in the Frocks, upon the relations of theſe perſons, <hi>Pretty,
Hewſon</hi> and <hi>Axtell,</hi> if you believe it upon theſe relations, and
after his own confeſſion, that if he was to do it again he
would do it; then upon this evidence that is given you, he
is to be found guilty, though he did not cut off the Kings
head. You have heard the Evidence on all ſides, it reſts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you, pray go together and conſider of your Verdict. I
have forgotten one thing, God forbid I ſhould omit any
thing that may be as well for advantage as againſt the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
at the Bar: if you take it ſingly, if you have nothing
if other proof, what another man ſays of me doth not charge

heard from himſelf, and what you have heard by relations
from others, that is to be left to you. It is my duty to tell
you, that which is ſaid by another of me, that alone is not
a pregnant evidence; you muſt remember withal, what is
ſworn poſitively, what he ſaid himſelf: this being ſaid, I

of the Jury, the Priſoners at the Bar ſtand Indicted of high
Treaſon, for Compaſſing and Imagining the death of the
late King <hi>CHARLES</hi> the Firſt of Glorious Memory. The
Indictment ſets forth ſeveral <hi>Overt-acts,</hi> by which that Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
doth appear, the Treaſon it ſelf is the Compaſſing:
Our Evidence will go on thus: We ſhall prove againſt them
all, that they did ſit (in that which they called the High
Court of Juſtice) upon the King, whilſt the King was a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
at the Bar, moſt of them did ſentence him, all but <hi>Harvy</hi>
and <hi>Penington</hi> did ſign that bloody Warrant for his Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and that one of the Priſoners at the Bar was in before the
High Court of Juſtice conſulting of bringing it about. When
we have proved this I think it is enough. Pray call the
Witneſſes.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, I do humbly conceive, if I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
that I had then done any thing of Treaſon, I would
not for all the World have been there. I was preſent when
his Majeſty did not own the Court, deſiring that both his
Houſes might meet, that he might have a Conference with
them for ſetling of the peace: My Lord, heartily and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly
I did endeavour that that advice might be embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
and that no ſentence might be pronounced. I was one
of thoſe (with ſome others) that did ſo far promote it, that
that which they called the High Court of Juſtice, did with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
to conſider of it, but the major part of it did diſſent.
But my Lord, I was ſo unhappy as to return to the Court,
though with reluctancy; I went with a reſolution not to go
more to them, nor never did; I was ſommoned to come to
the Court: I did declare I abhorred the thing, that my
Soul had reluctancy againſt it, and I was greatly grieved and
troubled at it, and I did refuſe any more to come, or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
about any thing that followed in order to his Majeſties
death, and to Sign and to Seal. And that I may make it
appear to your Lordſhips, I pray I may have a Witneſs or
two examined.</p>

I could, to divert them from the Sentence, I could not prevail.

                  <p>Sir, about the time that his Majeſty was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
in 1648. I was then Servant to Alderman <hi>Sleigh,</hi> who

came to Alderman <hi>Sleigh</hi>'s every night, and the Alderman
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:56280:144"/>
having ſome buſineſs with him, would ask him what News
there was at the High Court of Juſtice; he uſually told him
the paſſages upon any day; the Alderman asked him if ſo be
he thought his Majeſty might eſcape? he told him this, that
he would do what lay in his power that he might; that he
might not come to have Sentence paſt, upon <hi>Saturday</hi> being
alſo there, he told him this, that he had done what lay in his
power to hinder the Sentence, but could not attain his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,

This I ſhall take the boldneſs to ſay; (which ſhall be nothing

practices againſt his Majeſty, demonſtrated by my ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
refuſing to ſign the Warrant for his Execution, though
often ſollicited thereunto; I cannot deny but I ſate amongſt
them that day of the Sentence, but I cannot remember I
was there when the Sentence paſſed. My ſitting amongſt
them was out of ignorance, I knew not what I did, therefore
I hope you wil believe there was nothing of malice in any
thing I did, I was miſled to it.</p>

                  <p>That I may inform you in it, there is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
implied by Law, malice in the Act it ſelf: that which
you call malice, that you had no particular intention or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
againſt the King's Perſon, but in relation to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
that will not be to this preſent buſineſs; if it
ſhould extenuate any thing, that would be between God and
your own Soul; but as to that which is alledged in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment,
<hi>Maliciouſly, Murderouſly, and Traiterouſly,</hi> they are
the conſequences of Law. If a Man meet another in the
Street and run him through, in this caſe the Law implies
malice, though but to an ordinary Watchman, there is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
by the Law in the Fact; if there was no ſuch expreſſed
perſonal malice as you conceive, yet the Fact done, implies
malice in Law.</p>

<pb n="286" facs="tcp:56280:145"/>
to that poor underſtanding of the Law of <hi>England,</hi>
that I was capable of, there is no Fact that he can name that
is a Crime in it ſelf, but as it is circumſtantiated. Of
killing a Watchman, as your Lordſhip inſtanced, a Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
may be killed in not doing his Office, and yet no mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>

                  <p>I inſtanced that of a Watchman, to
ſhew there may be a malice by Law, though not expreſſed;
though a Man kill a Watchman, intending to kill another
Man, in that caſe it is malice in Law againſt him: ſo in this
caſe, if you went to kill the King when he was not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Office, becauſe he was in Priſon, and you hindred
him from it, the Law implies malice in this. It is true, all
Actions are circumſtantiated, but the killing of the King is
Treaſon of all Treaſons.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, I being preſent in Town
when that horrid Murder was contrived againſt the late
King, there came ſome Perſons of Honour, Servants to the
late King, to my Father's Houſe, Sir <hi>Edward Partridge,</hi> to
engage me to join with them to attempt the King's eſcape.
In order whereunto, they told me, nothing would tend ſo
much to his Majeſty's Service, as to endeavour to diſcover
ſome part of their Counſels, for that it was reſolved by
<hi>Cromwel</hi> to have the King tried at the <hi>High Court of Juſtice,</hi>
as they called it, the next day, and deſired me (if poſſible)
to be there to diſcover their Counſels, whereby the King
might have notice, and thoſe that were to attempt his
eſcape. In order whereunto, the next day by giving Mony
to the Officer of the <hi>Painted Chamber,</hi> I got in by day light
in the Lobby to the Lords Houſe; I eſpied a Hole in the
Wall under the Hangings, where I placed my ſelf till the
Council came; where they were contriving the manner of
trying the King when he ſhould come before them: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the manner of praying and private conſults amongſt
themſelves; when their Prayer was over, there came news
that the King was landed at Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi>'s Stairs; at
which <hi>Cromwel</hi> run to a Window, looking on the King as
he came up the Garden, he returned as white as the Wall:
returning to the Board, he ſpeaks to <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry
Mildmay,</hi>
how they and Sir <hi>William Breerton</hi> had concluded
on ſuch a Buſineſs; Then turning to the Board, ſaid thus;
<hi>My Maſters, He is come, He is come; and now we are doing
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:56280:146"/>
that great Work that the whole Nation will be full of: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I deſire you to let us reſolve here what anſwer we ſhall give
the King when he comes before us; for the firſt Queſtion that he
will ask us will be, By what Authority and Commiſſion do we
try him? To which none anſwered preſently. Then after a little
ſpace,</hi> Henry Marten, <hi>the Priſoner at the Bar, roſe up, and ſaid,
In the Name of the Commons and Parliament aſſembled, and all
the good People of</hi> England; which none contradicted, ſo
all roſe up, and then I ſaw every Officer that waited in the
Room, ſent out by <hi>Cromwel</hi> to call away my Lord ſuch a one
(whoſe Name I have forgot) who was in the Court of
Wards Chamber, that he ſhould ſend away the Inſtrument,
which came not, and ſo they adjourned themſelves to <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter-Hall,</hi>
going into the Court of Wards themſelves as
they went thither. When they came to the Court in <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter-Hall,</hi>
I heard the King ask them the very ſame Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
that <hi>Cromwel</hi> had ſaid to them.</p>

by his Witneſs how ſerious he was at it, and gave the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation

ſaw the Horſes of State of his late Majeſty to be ſold in
the Common Market; at which I called to the Rider, ſaid I,
What makes theſe Horſes here? ſays he, I am to ſell them;
Why, ſaid I, there's the King's Brand upon them, <hi>C. R.</hi>
and he ſhew'd them me: ſaid I, Will you ſell theſe Horſes?
What price? he asked me three or fourſcore pound a piece;
ſaid I, Who warrants the ſale of theſe Horſes? ſays he,

                  <p>My Lord, I hope that which is urged by the
Learned Counſel, will not have that impreſſion upon the
Court and Jury that it ſeems to have, That I am ſo obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in a thing ſo apparently ill: My Lord, if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for that Blood to be in the Body again, and every drop
that was ſhed in the late Wars, I could wiſh it with all my
heart: But, my Lord, I hope it is lawful to offer in my
own defence, that which when I did it, I thought I might
do. My Lord, there was the Houſe of Commons, as I
underſtood it, (perhaps your Lordſhips think it was not
a Houſe of Commons) but then it was the Supream Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of <hi>England,</hi> it was ſo reputed both at home and
abroad. My Lord, I ſuppoſe he that gives obedience to the
Authority in being <hi>de facto,</hi> whether <hi>de jure</hi> or no, I think
he is of a peaceable diſpoſition, and far from a Traitor. My
Lord, I think there was a Statute made in <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth's
time, whereby it was provided, That whoſoever
was in Arms for the King <hi>de facto,</hi> he ſhould be indempni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
though that King <hi>de facto,</hi> was not ſo <hi>de jure:</hi>
And if the Supream Officers <hi>de facto</hi> can juſtifie a War, (the
moſt pernicious Remedy that was ever adjudged by Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
be the Cauſe what it will) I preſume the Supream
Authority of <hi>England</hi> may juſtifie a Judicature, though it
be but an Authority <hi>de facto.</hi> My Lord, if it be ſaid that it
is but a third eſtate, and a ſmall parcel of that, my Lord,
it was all that was extant. I have heard Lawyers ſay, That
if there be Commons appurtenant to a Tenement, and that
Tenement be all burnt down except a ſmall Stick, the
Commons belong to that one ſmall piece, as it did to the
Tenement when all ſtanding. My Lord, I ſhall humbly
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:56280:147"/>
offer to conſideration, whether the King were the King
indeed, ſuch a one whoſe Peace, Crowns and Dignities,
were concerned in Publick Matters: My Lord, he was not
in execution of his Offices, he was a Priſoner. My Lord,
I will not defer you long, neither would I be offenſive, I had
then, and I have now a peaceable inclination, a reſolution
to ſubmit to the Government that God hath ſet over me. I
think his Majeſty that now is, is King upon the beſt Title
under Heaven, for he was called in by the Repreſentative
Body of <hi>England.</hi> I ſhall, during my life, long or ſhort,
pay obedience to him: Beſides, my Lord, I do owe my
life to him, if I am acquitted for this. I do confeſs, I did
adhere to the Parliaments Army heartily, my life is at his
mercy; if his Grace be pleaſed to grant it, I have a double
obligation to him.</p>

muſt have an anſwer in Parliament for it. He hath owned
the King, but thinks his beſt title is the acknowledgment

that the Jury would take notice, That though I am ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
in the Name of the King, that if I be acquitted the
King is not Caſt: It doth not concern the King that the
Priſoner be Condemned, it concerns him that the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
be Tried; it is as much to his Intereſt, Crown, and
Dignity, that the Innocent be acquitted, as that the Nocent

of our Evidence; and you may ſee how neceſſary it
is to diſtinguiſh between Confidence and Innocence; for
this very Perſon that deſires you to have a care how you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the Innocent, he doth ſeem to intimate to you, that
he is an innocent Perſon at the Bar; and yet confeſſes he
did ſit upon the King, did Sentence him to Death, that he
ſigned the Warrant for the Execution, and yet here ſtands
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:56280:147"/>
that Perſon that deſires you to have a care of condemning
Innocence: What is this at the bottom of it, but that my
Fact is ſuch as I dare not call it Innocence, but would have
you to believe it ſuch. Gentlemen of the Jury, was it your
intention the King ſhould be ſo tried, as this Priſoner mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?
It will concern you to declare, That the People of
<hi>England</hi> do abhor his Facts and Principles, every Fact the
Priſoner hath confeſſed himſelf, the ſitting in that Court,
which was Treaſon; his Sentencing was Treaſon; ſigning
the Warrant for Execution was the higheſt of Treaſons:
Gentlemen, all that he hath to ſay for himſelf is, there was
an Authority of his own making, whereby he becomes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent;
But we hope out of his own Mouth you will find
him guilty.</p>

Indicted.</hi> My Lord, it was not then in my Heart, either to
deny or juſtify any tittle of the matter of Fact: My Lord,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:56280:148"/>
The Matter that I was led into by ignorance, my Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
leads me to acknowledg: But, my Lord, if I ſhould
have ſaid Guilty in manner and form as I ſtood Indicted, I
was fearful I ſhould have charged my own Conſcience, as
then knowingly and maliciouſly to act it. My Lord, it
was my unhappineſs to be call'd to <hi>ſo ſad a Work,</hi> when I
had ſo few years over my head: A Perſon neither bred up
in the Laws, nor in Parliaments where Laws are made. I
can ſay with a clear Conſcience, I had no more enmity in
my heart to his Majeſty, than I had to my Wife that lay in
my boſom. My Lord, I ſhall deny nothing; After I was ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned,
I think truly I was at moſt of the Meetings; and I
do not ſay this, that I did not intend to ſay it before, but
preſerving that <hi>Salvo</hi> to my own Conſcience, That I did
not maliciouſly and knowingly do it, I think I am bound
in Conſcience to own it: As I do not deny but I was there,
ſo truly I do believe I did ſign the Inſtrument: And had I
known that then which I do now, (I do not mean, my Lord,
my Afflictions and Sufferings, it is not my Sufferings make
me acknowledg) I would have choſen a red hot Oven to
gone into as ſoon as that Meeting: I bleſs God, I do this
neither out of fear, nor hopes of favour, though the penalty
that may attend this acknowledgment may be grievous:
My Lord, I do acknowledg the Matter of Fact, and do ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
profeſs, I was led into it for want of years, I do not
juſtify either the Act or the Perſon; I was ſo unhappy then
as to be ignorant, and I hope ſhall not now (ſince I have
more light) juſtify that which I was ignorant of, I am ſure
my Heart was without malice; if I had been only asked in
matter of Fact at firſt, I ſhould have ſaid the ſame, I have
ſeen a little; The Great God before whom we all ſtand,
hath ſhewn his tender mercy to Perſons upon repentance;
<hi>Paul</hi> tells us, Though a Blaſphemer, and a Perſecuter of
Chriſt, it being done ignorantly, upon repentance he found
mercy: My Lord, Mercy I have found, and I do not doubt,
but mercy I ſhall find. My Lord, I came in upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,
and now I am here, I have in truth given your
Lordſhip a clear and full account, what ever that Law ſhall
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:56280:148"/>
pronounce, becauſe I was ignorant; yet I hope there will
be room found for that Mercy and Grace that I think was
intended by the Proclamation, and I hope by the Parliament
of <hi>England.</hi> I ſhall ſay no more, but in pleading of that,
humbly beg that your Lordſhips will be inſtrumental to the
King and Parliament on that behalf.—</p>

                  <p>I have not much to ſay, I never had any abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
therefore, my Lord, it was never my intent upon my
Plea, as was ſaid before, to deny any thing I have done;
for I was clearly convinced, that I ought to confeſs it before,
and I do confeſs againſt my ſelf, that I did ſit there ſeveral
times, and to the beſt of my remembrance, I did ſign and
ſeal the Warrant for his Execution; and truly, my Lord,
it was never in my heart to contrive a Plot of this nature.
How I came there I do not know, I was very unfit for ſuch
a Buſineſs, and I confeſs I did it ignorantly, not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the Law, ſo was carried away hidden in the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
not underſtanding what I did; therefore, my Lord, I
humbly intreat this honourable Court, that you will conſider
of it, and look upon me as one that out of ignorance did it;
and if I had known of my Act, I would rather have been
torn in pieces with a thouſand Horſes. When I heard of
the Declaration and gracious Pardon of his Majeſty, I confeſs
I went to my Lord Mayors &amp; laid hold of it; and I thought
my life as ſecure as it is now in my own hands: But I do
wholly caſt my ſelf upon the King's Mercy; and as I have
heard he is a gracious King, full of lenity and mercy, ſo I
hope I ſhall find it. I was never againſt Government, it
is a bleſſed thing that we have it, I hope all the Nations
will be happy under it. I ſhall ſubmit to his Majeſty and
Government; I can ſay no more, I was not brought up
a Scholar, but was a Tradeſman, and was meerly ignorant
when I went on in that Buſineſs; I do humbly intreat your
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:56280:149"/>
Lordſhips, that you would as tenderly as may be, preſent
my caſe to the King, whom I reſt upon, and leave all to
your Lordſhips wiſdom and diſcretion to do what you will
concerning me.—</p>

words, I ſhall be ingenuous before your Lordſhips. I ſhall
not wilfully nor obſtinately deny the Matter of Fact; But,
my Lord, I muſt, and I can with a very good Conſcience
ſay, That what I did, I did it very innocently, without any
intention of Murder; nor was I ever Plotter or Contriver
in that Murder; I never read in the Law, nor underſtood
the Caſe throughly; What-ever I have done, I have done
ignorantly.</p>

of the Court, when the King made the motion to
have it withdrawn; and upon the day (my Lord) that the
King was put to death, I was ſo ſenſible of it, that I went
to my Chamber and mourn'd, and would, if it had been in
my power, have preſerved his life. My Lord, I was not at
all any diſturber of the Government. I never interrupted
the Parliament at all. I had no hand in thoſe things, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in 1648, nor at any other time. I ſhall humbly beg
the favour of the King, that he would be pleaſed to grant

                  <speaker>Lord Chief Baron.</speaker>
                  <p>Gentlemen you of the Jury; Theſe
Priſoners that ſtand before you at the Bar, that is, Mr. <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
Pennington, Marten, Millington, Titchburn, Roe, Lilburn,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> there are eight; theſe are Perſons who by
the <hi>Act of Indempnity</hi> are to be tried for their Lives for the
Treaſons they have committed, but no Execution is to be
until the Parliament have further conſidered the Matter
that is before us, and you are to find the Matter of Fact;
What Mercy they ſhall find hereafter, that is to be left (as
I told you) to the conſideration of the Parliament, we are
to proceed according to Law and Juſtice. They are all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
for Compaſſing and Imagining the Death of our late
Soveraign Lord <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, of moſt glorious memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
And for that that hath been opened to you, there are
ſo many Overt Acts, which are as ſo many Evidences to
prove that Indictment, which is the compaſſing and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
of their Hearts to put the King to Death. If
any one of theſe be proved, that is alone enough to
prove the Indictment, which is the compaſſing and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
of the Heart, that is the Treaſon, the other are but
Evidences. If any thing burſt forth from the Mouth, or from
the Hand, as here it is, theſe are Evidences of the imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Heart: for this you have heard by the confeſſion of
all of them, that they did enough to find the Indictment, they
have all of them confeſſed their ſitting upon the King in that
traiterous Aſſembly, which they called the <hi>High Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</hi>
There is one of the Overt Acts expreſly laid down in
the Indictment, they took upon them an Authority to conſider
how to put the King to death, and that they did put the King
to death; but they were miſtaken, as ſome of them ſaid, that the
actual murdering of the King was not their meaning. But
if they did that which tended towards it, they are all guilty
of Treaſon; it is all one to you if they be guilty of any of
theſe; either Sitting, Sentencing, or Signing, they are guilty;
and all of theſe; except two, are guilty of all theſe. The Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:56280:150"/>
is clear and pregnant, there is ſomething hath been ſaid
by many of them with a great deal of expreſſion of ſorrow,
they did confeſs (all but one) the Fact; and that which
tended to their defence was ignorance; but that doth not
at all concern you. It will be taken in its due time into
conſideration; the ſeveral deportments of them all, that is
for another Judicature. Your buſineſs is to find the Matter
of Fact, only this let me repeat unto you, There is Mr. <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy</hi>
who hath pleaded ſeveral Matters which are not proper
for you, expreſſing his ſorrow and penitence; We ſhall not
trouble you with that, becauſe they are for the conſideration
of another Court, We ought all to have a tender compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
ought to be ſorry with and for them that are ſorrowful.
The like of Alderman <hi>Pennington. Marten</hi> hath done that
which looks forward more than backward, I could wiſh with
all my heart, he had looked more backward; that is, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
of that which is paſt, than obedience to that which
is to come; it is a trouble to repeat thoſe things which he
ſaid himſelf, and truly I hope in charity, he meant better
than his words were. <hi>Millington</hi> he hath done the like with
the reſt, confeſſed the Fact, put himſelf upon Mercy whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and ſaid, He <hi>was over-awed by the preſent Power.</hi> This I
repeat not as any thing to you, who are to conſider only
Matter of Fact. For Alderman <hi>Titchburn</hi> he hath ſpoken
very fully, and truly very conſcienciouſly—upon the whole
Matter, acknowledges his ignorance, his ſorrow, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
in point of Conſcience; and I beſeech God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
to incline his heart more and more to repentance.
<hi>They that crucified Chriſt</hi> (to uſe his own words) <hi>through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
found mercy.</hi> Colonel <hi>Roe,</hi> He confeſſes the ſame
wholly, and caſts himſelf upon the King's Mercy, and he
thought it a bleſſed thing that the King was reſtored again,
and ſubmitted wholly to mercy; and ſo did Mr. <hi>Lilburn,</hi> he
ſaid he went to his Chamber and mourned the day the King
was beheaded; I am very glad he had ſo early a ſenſe of
it. <hi>William Smith,</hi> He did it ignorantly, he was not guilty
thus far; that was, he was led on, even like one ſilly Sheep
that follows another, by what relation I have heard of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:56280:151"/>
the Perſon, at that time he was not thought fit to be of the
Privy Council. There is nothing more to ſay to you, the
Fact is confeſſed by them all. It is ſo clear you need not go
from the Bar.</p>

Gentlemen of the Jury; The Priſoners at the Bar ſtand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
of High Treaſon, for compaſſing and imagining the
Death of the late King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, of bleſſed memory;
The Evidence by which we ſhall make out againſt them this
Treaſon of their Heart, in compaſſing and imagining the
King's Death, (for that is the ſubſtance of the Indictment,
and all that follows is but Evidence) will be by proving
that they did ſit as Judges in that pretended Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
when the King ſtood a Priſoner at the Bar; That they
did Sentence him to death every one of them; and we ſhall
prove againſt all but one of them, that they did ſign that
bloody Warrant for murthering of the King; and againſt
one of them that ſtands at the Bar, we ſhall prove (to his
ſhame and confuſion of face) that he did <hi>ſpit</hi> in the <hi>face</hi> of
our late Sovereign Lord.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, I have humbly pleaded <hi>Not
Guilty,</hi> not with any intention to juſtifie the Fact, or to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate
it; but my Lord, in regard there is that charged in
the Indictment, that my Conſcience ſaith I am not guilty of,
I durſt not plead guilty; otherwiſe, my Lord, I ſhould not
have troubled you with <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> but ſhould have humbly
taken the ſhame and confuſion for it; it is my intention to
put the Court to as little trouble as poſſible I can, therefore
I do moſt humbly intreat of your Lordſhips and the Court,
that you will permit me to acknowledg that which will be
a ſufficient evidence of my Conviction, if the Court ſo pleaſe,
and that you will be pleaſed to hear me on my behalf; if I
can humbly offer to you ſome ſpecial thing which is not in
the Caſe of another, (I could wiſh it had, if it had, we had
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:56280:152"/>
none been here) I do humbly acknowledg, that to ſit upon
that occaſion in that place, is evidence enough to convince
what is in the Heart, except by ſome ſignal Actions that
might happen from ſome that might ſhew how it was his
unhappineſs to be put into ſuch a buſineſs, yet had neither
Malice nor Treaſon in his Heart: I do humbly conceive,
that there is that goodneſs in you, that this Plea, this Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation
will be moſt welcome to you. My Lord, though
there was ſuch a thing, ſuch an unparallel'd thing, I was
thruſt into this number, but never was in conſultatin about
the thing: God is witneſs, I was not put in till the Act
was ready to paſs in a ſecond Commitment, by one of the
ſame number; I denied it, yet they ſaid I muſt make one, I
muſt take my ſhare, ſo I came in. Never did I know of his
Majeſty's being brought to <hi>London</hi> till he came. My Lords,
In this great unhappineſs, I think it is ſome mitigation, and
I judg it a happineſs that ſo wiſe, prudent Perſons as this
Court conſiſts of, that you are my Judges that can look back,
my Lord, and conſider what the Times were then; and
can, my Lord, account it a happineſs that there is a ſpecial
Wiſdom in you, that in nice Caſes you will be able to make
a diſtinction. I do indeed, my Lords, ſadly and ſeriouſly
confeſs, That I was divers times with thoſe Perſons that
were called Judges of the late King, at ſeveral of their
Meetings and Sittings; it is long ago, I cannot ſay how
often, I was ſeveral times there. My Lord, I do humbly
beg of your Lordſhips, (I will trouble you as ſhort as I can)
that you would be pleaſed ſo far to favour me, as to give
me leave to give you a ſhort account of the buſineſs; The
laſt day his Majeſty came to that which was called then a
Court, ſeveral times he was brought, (I think thrice) and
his Charge was given in words high enough, he ſaid, He
<hi>could not acknowledg their Juriſdiction,</hi> that was the Anſwer,
my Lord, till the laſt day, then I confeſs I was there. He
that was called <hi>Preſident,</hi> did again and again tell him the
Heads of his Charge; told him, he had ſeveral days given
for conſideration, That this was the laſt day that the Court
(as they call'd themſelves) would give him his final Anſwer;
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:56280:152"/>
if he ſtood ſtill to day and move to the juriſdiction of the
Court, they muſt take all <hi>pro Confeſſo,</hi> and would give ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence:
My Lord, to this his Majeſty indeed with a great
deal of compoſedneſs and wiſdom told them to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
I cannot own your Juriſdiction, you have power enough
indeed, I wiſh you may uſe it well, but becauſe you are ſo
ready to give a ſentence which may be ſooner given then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided,
I think fit to let you know, that I have ſomething
that I deſire to ſpeak to my Parliament, for I have ſomething
to offer unto them that will be ſatisfactory to you all, and will
be for the immediate ſettlement of the Kingdom in
peace—My Lord, he that was called Preſident,
anſwered, that no notice could be taken of any thing but
onely whether he would anſwer to his Charge: upon that
my Lord, his Majeſty indeed (with the greateſt earneſtneſs
that ever I beheld, and yet in no unſeemly paſſion) told
them they might ſoon repent of ſuch a ſentence; that
he did conjure them to withdraw once again and to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of it, if it were but half an hour, or (ſaith he, if that
be too much for you) I will withdraw. My Lord, here
I can make my appeal to him that muſt judg me when you
have done with me, I had not a murderous nor a trayte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
thought againſt him, but, Sir, I confeſs ſuch deep paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
did fall upon me, that truly my ſelf I was not.
I remember the perſons betwen whom I ſate, as it fell out,
were one Mr. <hi>Cawly,</hi> and Col. <hi>Walton,</hi> theſe two I ſate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt,
theſe were the very words I ſpeak to them, <hi>Have we
hearts of ſtone, are we men?</hi> they laboured to appeaſe me, they
told me I would ruine both my ſelf and them; ſaid I, if I die
for it, I muſt do it. <hi>Cromwel</hi> ſate juſt the ſeat below me, the
hearing of me make ſome ſtir, whiſpering, he looked up
to me, and asked me, if I were my ſelf? what I meant
to do, that I could not be quiet? Sir, ſaid I, No, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be quiet: upon that I ſtarted up in the very nick,
when the Preſident commanded the Clerk to read the
Sentence, I ſtepping up, and as loud as I could ſpeak, ſpoke
to this effect, theſe words, or to the like purpoſe, My
Lord, (ſaid I) I am not ſatisfied to give my conſent
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:56280:153"/>
to this Sentence, but have Reaſons to offer to you againſt
it, and I deſire the Court may adjourn to hear me: preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he ſtept up and looked at me; Nay, ſaith he, if any one
of the Court be unſatisfied, the Court muſt adjourn: Sir, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
they did adjourn into the inner <hi>Court of Wards;</hi>
when they came there, I was called upon by <hi>Cromwel</hi> to give
an account why I had put this trouble and diſturbance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Court? I did ſpeak, Sir, to this effect, (it is long
ago, the very words I think I cannot ſpeak) but to this
effect I did ſpeak: My Lord, I ſhould have been exceeding
glad if the Court had been pleaſed to condeſcend to this
gracious Expreſſion; but it is not too late for me: I deſire
not his Death but his Life, and that the Nations may be
ſetled in Peace: The King now is pleaſed to offer, That if
he might but ſpeak with his Parliament, he would offer to
them ſuch things as ſhould be ſatisfactory to us all. So
(ſaid I) what would you have? Your pretence of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to theſe Proceedings was, That after ſuch a long
and bloody War, his Majeſty would not condeſcend to ſuch
Conceſſions as might ſecure the Parliaments Party; but now
you hear him, that he will give every one of us ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
I told them, ſadly told them, (I think I may truly
ſay, more ſadly then, than at this time) that if they ſhould
go precipitantly on, and give Judgment upon him, before
they had acquainted the Parliament with what the King
was pleaſed to offer, we ſhould never be able anſwer it;
the rather, my Lord, (and that I did preſs with all the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
underſtanding that I had) if they did but conſider the
laſt concluded Order that the Parliament made after the
paſſing of the Act for Trial, (that which was ſo called) I
ſay there was this Order that ſhut up all, That upon any
Emergency that could not at that time be thought on in the
Houſe, the Court ſhould immediately acquaint the Houſe
with it. My Lord, I did infer as ſtrongly as I could to
them, That if this were not Emergent, I could not tell
what was: The King denied the Juriſdiction of the Court,
and yet with all vehemency deſired to ſpeak with his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
were not theſe Emergencies? if not, I knew not
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:56280:153"/>
what were Emergences. My Lords, Beſides this, there was
another thing I did preſs, that I thought was of greater
conſequence than this, as to the ſatisfaction of every Man's
particular Conſcience; that admitting (if it might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted)
that the King was liable to his Subjects, that they
might call him to an account, and might condemn him, (I
beg your pardon that I take the boldneſs to make ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions)
but if ſuch a thing might be admitted, certainly
it did exceedingly become thoſe Judges that were to give
ſuch a Sentence, (not againſt a common Perſon, but againſt
the greateſt) to be very well ſatisfied in Matter of Fact, to
a full Evidence before them, that ſuch and ſuch things that
were ſaid were true. I do acknowledg this, that to the beſt
of my apprehenſion (I wiſh it had been ſo to others) there
was a great ſhortneſs in this; I do humbly affirm this, That
not one Member of the Court did hear one Witneſs, <hi>Viva
Voce;</hi> I did preſs, That if the Court did give Judgment
againſt the King, without a fair Examination, I ſaid it was
ſuch a thing, as no Judg at any Aſſizes would do againſt a
common Perſon; what I had was from <hi>Peters,</hi> and from
ſome private Whiſpers from one of them that is gone, and
hath received his Sentence and Doom. <hi>Cromwel</hi> did anſwer
with a great deal of ſtorm, He told the Preſident, that now
he ſaw what great reaſon the Gentleman had to put ſuch a
trouble and diſturbance upon them; ſaith he, Sure he doth
not know that he hath to do with the hardeſt hearted Man
that lives upon the Earth; however it is not fit that the
Court ſhould be hindred from their Duty by one peeviſh
Man; he ſaid, the bottom was known, that he would fain
ſave his old Maſter, and deſired the Court, without any
more ado, would go and do their Duty. Another that
ſpoke to me in anſwer, was one that hath been before you,
and hath rereived his Sentence, but is not dead, (and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
I may not name his Name) his anſwer was to what I
have ſaid, That ſome Men were either Scepticks or Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels.
After this I did go into the Speaker's Chamber, and
there I did eaſe my mind and heart with tears, God only
knows. I have an unhappy memory, I have ſlipt many thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

I was induced to it. Certainly, my Lord it, doth argue that
there was not malice predommant; Love and Hatred can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be at the ſame time in one perſon. Deſign, my Lord, what

and refer my ſelf to the Court: Now, my Lord, this is the
truth of my Caſe, there is that honorable Gentleman, the Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
of the Houſe of Commons, knows, I lived in <hi>Eſſex</hi> in the
beginning of theſe troubles, and I was inforced to forſake my
habitation, I came from thence to <hi>London,</hi> where I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved
my ſelf fairly in my way. Afterwards in 1648 I was
choſen a member into the Parliament; in <hi>June</hi> 1648 I
came in a Member of the Parliament. My Lord, after the
diviſion of the Houſe, by the inſolency of the Soldiery; ſome
came to me, and deſired me, that I would go to the Houſe,
I was then at my Chamber at <hi>Lincolns</hi>-Inne, I forbore a
Week and more; ſaid I, I do not expect to be admitted, for
they look upon me as another perſon; ſaid they, If you will
go, you ſhall have no contradiction; I went, and went in,
when I was in, the firſt buſineſs that came was the buſineſs
of Tryal of the King, and it was put on me to be Chair-man
for bringing in this Act for Tryal; I did not know how to
contradict that power or authority (be it what it will) but
I muſt obey (I fear my ruine will follow it:) in that reſpect
my Lord, when I came there, I was forced to run through
out, what they had impoſed upon me.—Having ſeen
me, I could not ſhrink from them for fear of my own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
and thereupon I did go in, and did that which I
have confeſſed to your Lordſhips, not out of any malignity to
his Majeſty. I had never any diſreſpect to him in my life;
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:56280:156"/>
My Lord, I did not know which way to be ſafe in any thing:
without Doors was miſery, within Doors was miſchief. I
do appeal to all that had any thing to do with me, that I
never did any wrong to any that was of the Kings party, but
helped them as I was able. My Lord, when the Government
was thus toſſed, and turned, and tumbled, and I know not
what, and the ſecluded Members came into the Houſe, I
knew not what to do in that caſe neither. Aſſoon as this
Parliament had declared the Treaty, which was the eighth
of <hi>May,</hi> the ninth of <hi>May</hi> I appeared before the right honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
the Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> and did claim the benefit of
his Majeſties gracious Declaration, and to become a Loyal
Subject, as in my heart I alwayes was; and my Lord Mayor
being there, I hope he will teſtifie, that aſſoon as I heard
of the Proclamation, I rendered my ſelf according to the
Proclamation; My Lord, this hath been the carriage of me,
being alwayes under fear and force, I refer my ſelf to your
Lordſhips.</p>

                  <p>But I deſire to be heard. I am loath to trouble you
much, I will tell you how I was brought into this buſineſs.
My Lord, I was a Member of that Houſe, that erected this
Court, when the Treaty was in the Iſle of <hi>Wight.</hi> Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
after the Army came up, I was utterly againſt that
Act in the Houſe. When the Army came up to purge the
Houſe, I was much troubled at it, I deſired to know the
Charge they had againſt them. Two or three dayes after I
did move, and there were other Gentlemen that did move
to know what Charge there was. They ſent word we ſhould
have a Charge in due time, we ſent and none came, but ſaid we
ſhould have it in due time: I went to thoſe worthy Gent. to
ſee them in priſon, and ſeeing nothing would be done, I took
my leave and made account to ſee them no more, and went
down into the Country to <hi>Leiceſter-ſhire:</hi> I was ſent for up
ſeveral times. I would not come with threats upon pain of
Sequeſtration. My Lords, there were Petitions going up
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:56280:157"/>
and down in the Country for bringing the King to that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
which was againſt my conſcience. I went to <hi>Rutland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi>
I heard there were ſome things working there, I uſed
my intereſt, and I thank God I ſtopt it. I came then to <hi>London,</hi>
when all theſe things were deſtroyed I came to <hi>London:</hi> the
day before the Sentence was given, I went to the Houſe
(thought nothing) ſome were ſent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and I was
ſent for to the Houſe, and my name was in the Act unknown
to me, but one ſent a Note in my Lord <hi>Gray's</hi> Name, that
he would ſpeak with me; I went to him, and I ſaid, my
Lord, what would you do with me? ſaith he, I did not ſend
for you. Thereupon <hi>Cromwel</hi> and <hi>Ireton</hi> laid hold on me, ſaid
they, We ſent for you, you are one of the High Court. No,
ſaid I, not I, my Judgement is againſt it: they carried me
to the Court. When the King deſired to ſpeak with his
Parliament, I riſing up, one told me I muſt not be heard, for
the Preſident was to give Judgement, and ſaid there was an
order that none ſhould ſpeak in Court. Mr. <hi>Downes</hi> did move,
and they did adjourn the Court, and I was glad I got out,
<hi>Cromwell</hi> laughed, and ſmiled, and jeared in the Court of
Wards. I hope your Lordſhip will be pleaſed to conſider, I
was no Contriver, no Soldier that put the force upon the
Houſe, that erected the Court; None of the Law-makers,
or did any thing maliciouſly againſt the King. My Lord, I
was looked upon with an evil eye, for regarding the King's
friends in the Country: <hi>Gray</hi> he told me the King would not
die, I hope he will not, ſaid I. The next day on <hi>Monday,</hi> I
went to the Houſe, they were labouring to get hands for his
Execution at the Door. I refuſed, and went into the Houſe;
ſaith <hi>Cromwell,</hi> thoſe that are gone in ſhall ſet their hands,
I will have their hands now. That night I went to the
Lord <hi>Grays,</hi> and he ſaid, I am afraid they will put him to
death. I ſaid ſo alſo. My Lord, I have been a great ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer,
I was drawn in, trapan'd into it, ſince being a friend
to the Kings friends, I am almoſt ruined in my eſtate; I
beſeech your Lordſhips make the beſt interpretation. I hope
you will believe I was no Contriver, I humbly lay hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Kings mercy and favour. I came in upon the Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:56280:158"/>
I pray that this Honourable Court, will prefer my
Petition to the King and both Houſes of Parliament, which
the Court then received.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, I am now it ſeems Convicted by Law,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:56280:159"/>
and ſo adjudged: Your Lordſhips the other day on my deſire
told me I might have liberty to ſpeak upon my trial. I
muſt now beg the like upon a condemned perſon.</p>

                  <speaker>Waller.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lords I was the firſt that pleaded Guilty, I
bleſs God that he gave me a heart to do it, I find moſt peace
in the doing of it; and ſince there is nothing left but hopes
of Mercy, I humbly ſubmit it to your Lordſhips to hear me in
this ſad condition, that that may make me ſeem more capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of mercy. I have, my Lords, been ſo unhappy to have
been tranſplanted out of my Country theſe thirty years, I
have been but once theſe eleven years in <hi>England,</hi> this muſt
needs make me a ſtranger.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Ch. B.</speaker>
                  <p>I muſt not hinder you, becauſe it is for mercy that
you plead, but conſider with your ſelf whether it will not be
better to give it in a Petition: I leave it to you, we can do
nothing in point of Mercy, but Judgment.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Waller.</speaker>
                  <p>Onely this (My Lord) whether I am not the more
capable of your mercy?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Ch. B.</speaker>
                  <p>That you may underſtand it, the Act of Indemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Parliament hath excepted you; yet upon ſome quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications,
we are to proceed according to Law, that is, to go
to Conviction and Judgment. The Act ſayes, that after
Judgment there ſhall be no execution, but that it ſhall be
ſuſpended till a further Act of Parliament to be paſſed for
that purpoſe; ſo that in the mean time we are to proceed
no further then Judgment. That which concerns Mercy, is
referred to another place. If you pleaſe to ſay any thing to
ſatisfie us, or to go by way of Petition, it muſt be left to you,
but what you ſay for mercy is nothing to us.</p>

                  <speaker>Waller.</speaker>
                  <p>I humbly thank your Lordſhips for this clear and
noble dealing, and withall, I would beg that theſe people
that are witneſſes of my ſhame and guilt, may know that it
was a force and temptation upon me; I ſhall not inſiſt much,
I have ſaid, that I did plead guilty, which was moſt ſafe to
my own Conſcience, yet I ſhould make it appear, that I did
appear more to preſerve the King from Tryal and Sentence,
then any other.</p>

                  <speaker>Lord Finch.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Hardreſs Waller,</hi> I have heard of late of your
ſorrow, which I was glad to hear of, becauſe you are my
kinſman, both by your Father and Mothers ſide, and alſo my
Countrey-man; I was glad to hear of your great penitence
for that horrid crime, and I would have been glad to have
ſeen it now; adviſe with your ſelf whether you do your ſelf
any good in ſpeaking to extenuate, when you know there
is no man againſt whom there are ſuch circumſtances of ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation
as againſt you; conſider whether a publick peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
would not be more proper.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Waller.</speaker>
                  <p>I beſeech you report me both to his Majeſty and
Parliament, and receive me into your grace, as being peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
truly penitent: To ſay ſo now were a ſmall thing, for the
fear of the puniſhment may procure it, but I have been more
penitent when no eye hath ſeen me but God; when I never
imagined to be queſtioned for this ſin, then my heart hath
yerned in the buſineſs; but I ſhal not trouble your Lordſhips,
God holds forth Mercy, his Majeſty holds forth Mercy, the
Parliament holds forth Mercy. My Lords, let me ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to you (though it be but a word) of the violence, and
force of temptation; you may have been under it, or may come
to it; Chriſt himſelf was under it; we find that faithful <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
by the power of a Temptation delivered up his wife
to commit Adultery, which ſcarce a Heathen would; we
finde that valiant <hi>Peter</hi> denied his Maſter, righteous <hi>Lot</hi>
committed inceſt. None abhors this fact more then I do; I
have done it ſo long beforehand, I need not be afraid to ſpeak
it in the face of the Judge of all men, that is all I ſhall ſay. I
rendred my ſelf three times; I had as much opportunity to
make my eſcape as any perſon whatſoever.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, then I ſhall apply my ſelf to that point,
I humbly conceive my Lord, that my overt acts were not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
ſet down in the Indictment, as might be ſufficient
in Law to attaint me of high Treaſon, I do not remember
that the Overt act that was applyed to me in evidence was
charged in the Indictment, I have onely that exception, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the inſufficiency of that point. In the next place, my
Lord, there is not the right additions to my name, there are
many perſons of the ſame name, I am arraigned by the name

                  <p>My Lord, I have this to ſpeak in arreſt of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that the Indictment being grounded upon that ſtatute
of the twenty fifth of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, it is either miſtaken
or not purſued; my Lords, I did yeſterday give you the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

purſued.</p>

                  <speaker>Axtell.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, I do not find in that ſtatute, that words
are an overt act, words only.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Ch. B.</speaker>
                  <p>This was over-ruled. The things that you obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
were theſe, That there is not any overt act that is laid,
that could be applicable to your caſe: if it were not particularly
applicable (you are found guilty by the Jury) it would be
nothing: But there is an overt act, you were preſent at the
Court, beating the Souldiers, ſending for an Executioner:
but for words, if one man ſhould ſay, here is the King, go
and kill him, this is Treaſon; but you were guilty in all
according to Law. You being there and doing this, you
were not guilty onely of the words, but of all that was done,
there is none but Principals in Treaſon. What we ſay and
do to you, we well know we muſt anſwer before God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
for it.</p>

God before whom I ſhall have another tryall, I do not find
my ſelf guilty either of conſulting, contriving, or having a
hand in the death of the King, I am innocent, and I pray God
that my innocent blood—</p>

                  <p>YOu that are Priſoners at the Bar, you ſtand here in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Capacities, yet all of you perſons convicted of the
deteſtable and execrable murder of our Soveraign Lord King
<hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, of bleſſed memory. Miſtake me not, I do not
ſay that you are all of you guilty of executing the fact, but
in Law and in conſcience <hi>(pro tanto,</hi> though not <hi>pro toto)</hi> you
are guilty of it, in that you prepared the way and
means to it, in that you brought his head to the block,
though you did not cut it off. You are here in three ſorts,
and I muſt apply my words accordingly, and truely I do it
with as much ſorrow of heart as you have, many of you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
perſons of liberal education, great parts, I ſay you are of
three ſorts. There are ſome of you that though the Judgment
of death is to paſs againſt you, by his Majeſties grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
and the mercy under him, of the two houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Execution is to be ſuſpended untill another Act of
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:56280:162"/>
Parliament ſhall paſs to that purpoſe, that is, all of you but
three; for thoſe three, the one of them that was laſt called,
<hi>William Heveningham,</hi> he is in another capacity too; for I
preſume ſome time will be given to him to conſider
of ſomething relating to him, before any order will be
given for his execution; there are two others of you, and
that is <hi>Dan. Axtel</hi> and <hi>Francis Hacker,</hi> and for you, as it yet
ſtands before us, there is no mercy, there is no room for it: but
though you be in theſe ſeveral Claſſes, yet what I ſhall ſay
will concern you all, becauſe I do not know how it may fall
with you, none of us know how ſoon we may come to our
deaths, ſome (probably) ſooner then others, all muſt come
to it: you are now before the Tribunal of man, but that is
for Judgment for your offence here, but there is another Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hereafter, and a Tribunal before which both you and we
muſt ſtand, every man here, and we muſt receive according
to our work; thoſe that have done ignorantly, by a ſerious
and unfeigned repentance, God Almighty may ſhew mercy
unto them. He hath reſerved mercy even for the greateſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders.
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf when he preſecuted Chriſt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly,
upon his repentance he found mercy; thoſe of you
that are not yet convicted in your conſciences of the foulneſs
of this horrid fact, look into your Conſciences a little more,
and ſee if it be not a great Judgment for your former offence
that you ſhould be given over to a reprobate ſenſe; let me
tell you, a ſeared Conſcience, a bold confidence not upon
good grounds, is ſo far from ſecuring the Conſcience, it may
ſtifle perhaps the mouth of Conſcience, but it will riſe up
more in Judgment againſt you. Here you have made your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
and I do not blame you for it; life is precious, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the thoughts of your hearts are open, whether you
did it ignorantly, covetouſly, or to get the Government
into your own hands, that I am not able to ſearch into, God
and you only know that; give me leave to ſay ſomething,
perhaps I have repeated it by parts before. God is my witneſs
what I ſpeak, I ſpeak from mine own Conſcience, and that
is this, Gentlemen, becauſe I ſaw it ſtuck with ſome of you,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:56280:163"/>
that is, that whatſoever the caſe was, that by the Laws of
theſe Nations, the fundamental Laws, there could not be
any coercive power over your King. I ſpeak it again, becauſe
I would as near as I could, ſpeak the whole truth, and would
not miſlead any man in ſuch a caſe; remember <hi>that no power,
no perſon, no Community or body of men, (not the people, either col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively
or repreſentatively, have any coercive power over the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the King by the fundamental Laws:</hi> for that, Gentlemen, I
ſhall begin to ſhew you that which all of you might remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that is, your oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, and
to add to this that obligation which all this whole Nation
did oblige themſelves to, by the Parliament, without queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
then rightly repreſented and in being, the firſt of K. <hi>James;</hi>
whereby to ſhew you, that not only perſons, but the Body
politick of the Nations, not only the ſingle Members, but
the Members in both houſes of Parliament, were loyal and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
ſubjects to the King, their head, even to yeeld a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
and humble Obedience, and Allegiance. I told you
the Act of the 1. of K. <hi>James,</hi> when K. <hi>James</hi> came firſt into
<hi>Engl. We the Lords and Com. repreſenting the whole People of the
Nation,</hi> (the very words of the Act are ſo <hi>primo Jacobi,</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the firſt,) <hi>Repreſenting the whole Body of the Nation, do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
an humble natural Leige Obedience to the King, as Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme,
his Heirs and Succeſſors. And in the name of themſelves
and all the people, humbly ſubmit themſelves, untill the laſt drop
of their bloud be ſpent in defence of the King and his Royall poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;</hi>
and therefore they did oblige themſelves, and all the
People of <hi>England,</hi> as far as they could repreſent them, (the
words are more full then I can expreſs them) and indeed
it is ſo dark I cannot read them. They did acknowledg, to
be bound to him and his Imperial Crown. Remember
theſe were not words of Complement, you ſhall find that
they all of them, and ſo did ſo many of you as were Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Parliament, yea all of you, before you came into
the Houſe of Commons, did take the Oath of Allegiance,
which was made after this Recognition, the third and
fourth of King <hi>James,</hi> or otherwiſe, were not to be Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:56280:163"/>
What was that Oath of Allegiance that you took?
it was, That you ſhould defend the King his Perſon, (that
is in 3 <hi>Jacobi,</hi> Chapter the fourth, his Crown and Dignity)
What was it? Not only againſt the Pope's Power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
but the words are, <hi>or otherwiſe:</hi> look into the Act,
and reflect upon your Conſcience, and you ſhall find that
all did ſwear to defend the King, his Crown and Dignity,
and there it is called <hi>Imperial Crown.</hi> I would have you lay
this to heart, and ſee how far you have kept this Oath.
Gentlemen, In the Oath of Supremacy which you all took
therein, you did further acknowledg that the King was the
only Supream Governour of this Realm: Mark the words,
I will repeat them that you may lay it to heart, you that
have more time to apply it to your Fact; and you that have
leſs time, for ought I know, you have reaſon to conſider
what I have to ſay; you ſware then, That the King by the
Oath of Supremacy, which all of you have taken, or ought
to have taken; if any of you have not taken it, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
you are not abſolved from the obligation of it;
but moſt of you did take it, there you ſware that the King
is the only Supream Governor of this Realm; and you
ſware there, that you would defend all Juriſdictions, Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
Preeminencies and Authorities granted or belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the King's Highneſs, His Heirs and Succeſſors, or
united and annexed unto the Imperial Crown of this Realm.
For the firſt; If the King be Supream, then there is no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination.
<hi>Non habet majorem, non habet parem,</hi> that
(word <hi>Imperial Crown)</hi> is at leaſt in nine or ten ſeveral
Statutes; it is the very word in this Act that was made
lately in purſuance of former Acts concerning Judicial Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.
And ſo in the time of King <hi>Charles,</hi> they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
him to be their Leige Sovereign; I ſay that
word <hi>Supream,</hi> and ſo the word <hi>Imperial Crown,</hi> is in the
firſt of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> the third, and the eighth of <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth;</hi>
the twenty fourth of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, Chap. 12.
there it is ſaid this Kingdom is an <hi>Imperial Crown, ſubject to
none but God Almighty.</hi> Before theſe times, you ſhall find
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:56280:164"/>
in the ſixteenth of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, the Statute of <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munire,</hi>
the Crown of <hi>England</hi> ſubject to God alone. I will
go higher, <hi>William Rufus</hi> (ſome of you are Hiſtorians, and
you ſhall find the ſame in <hi>Eadmerus,</hi> and alſo in <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew
Paris,</hi> ſhortly after <hi>William Rufus</hi> his Time) when
he wrote to the Pope, he challenged, and had the ſame
liberty in this Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> as the Emperor had
in his Empire, (miſtake me not, I ſpeak only as to the
Perſon of the King) I do not meddle of Rights between
the King and Subjects, or Subject and Subject; you ſee in
this Caſe concerning the Death of his Majeſty's dear Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and our Bleſſed Sovereign of happy memory, he
doth not judg himſelf but according to Law, that which I
aſſert is as to the Perſon of the King, which was the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg
of Emperors as to their Perſonal Priviledges, if he
had offended and committed an Offence, he was only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
to God himſelf. I will come back to what I
have ſaid; You ſwore to be faithful to the King as Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme.
The King of <hi>Poland</hi> hath a Crown, but at his Oath
of Coronation, it is conditioned with the People, That
if he ſhall not govern according to ſuch and ſuch Rules,
they ſhall be freed from their Homage and Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
But it differs with our King, for he was a King
before Oath. The King takes his Oath, but not upon
any condition; this I ſhew you, to let you ſee that we
have no coercive Power againſt the King. The King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
was anointed with Oil at his Coronation, which was
to ſhew that Abſolute Power, (I do not ſay of Government)
but of being accountable to God for what he did: The Law
ſaith, <hi>The King doth no injury to any Man;</hi> not but that the
King may have the imbecilities and infirmities of other Men,
but the King in his ſingle Perſon can do no wrong: but if
the King command a Man to beat me, or to diſſeize me of my
Land, I have my remedy againſt the Man, though not againſt
the King. The Law in all Caſes preſerves the Perſon of the
King to be untouched, but what is done by his Miniſters un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully,
there is a remedy againſt his Miniſters for it; but in
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:56280:164"/>
this Caſe, when you come to the Perſon of the King, what do
our Law Books ſay he is? they call it, <hi>Caput Reipublicae, ſalus
Populi,</hi> the Leiutenant of God; and let me tell you, there
was never ſuch a blow given to the Church of <hi>England</hi> and
the Proteſtant Religion. There was a Caſe, and that of
the <hi>Spencers,</hi> you ſhall find in the <hi>7th</hi> Report of the Lord
<hi>Cook,</hi> in <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Caſe, that Homage is due to the King
in his Politick Capacity; and then they made this damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Inference, That therefore if the King did not demean
himſelf as he ought, that he ſhould be reformed <hi>pure aſpertee,</hi>
by aſperity, ſharpneſs or Impriſonment: but theſe were
condemned by two Acts of Parliament in Print, that they
could not do that even in that Caſe, one was called the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
of <hi>Hugh Spencer;</hi> and the other is in 1. <hi>Edward</hi> 3.
upon the Roll. My Maſters, In the firſt of <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth,
you ſhall find it in the printed ſeven Books, he
ſaith, <hi>That as to the Regality of his Crown, he is immediately
ſubject unto God.</hi> Mark the Doctrine of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> Gentlemen, I do not know with what Spirit of
Equivocation any Man can take that Oath of Supremacy:
You ſhall find in the Articles of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
the laſt but one or two; it is that Article which
ſets forth the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> they
ſay, That the Queen, and ſo the King, hath the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Power in this Realm, and hath the chief Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
over all the Eſtates of the Realm, the very words
are ſo; this was ſhortly after making the Act; the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
were in 1552, and ſhe came in 1558, or 1559; it is
to ſhew you the King hath the chief Government over
all the Eſtates within the Nation; and if you look upon
it, you ſhall find it was not only the Judgment of the
Church, but of the Parliament at the ſame time. They
did confirm this Article ſo far, that they appointed
that no Man ſhould take or be capable of a Living, but
thoſe that had taken that Oath. God forgive thoſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
that went againſt it. The Queen and the Church were
willing that theſe ſhould be put into Latin, that all the
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:56280:165"/>
World might ſee the Confeſſion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
and of the People of <hi>England,</hi> you may reade it in <hi>Camb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den:</hi>
I have told you how and wherein the chief Power
conſiſted, not in reſpect the King could do what he would;
no, the Emperors themſelves did not challenge that, but
this they challenge by it, That they were not accountable
to Man for what they did: No Man ought to touch the
Perſon of the King, I preſs it to you in point of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
you ſee in the Scripture, in <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 51. the Pſalm of
Mercy, whereby we ask pardon of God for our great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences;
I think none of you in this condition, but will
join in this; you know the Adultery and Murder that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
committed, this penitential Pſalm was made for that;
What doth he ſay? <hi>Againſt thee, thee only have I ſinned,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>tibi ſoli peccavi, Domine;</hi> not becauſe he had not ſinned
againſt Man, for 'tis plain, he had ſinned both againſt <hi>Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheba</hi>
and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> too: But becauſe he was not liable to the
Tribunal of Man, he was not bound nor accountable to
any Man upon Earth. And now, my Maſters, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you conſider, that ſome of you for ought I know
ſuddenly, and ſome of you for ought I know not long
after, all of us we do not know how ſoon, muſt come to
make a right account to God of what we have done. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this Life you enter into an Eternity, an Eternity of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
or of Woe; God Almighty is merciful to thoſe that
are truly penitent; the Thief upon the Croſs, and to all
that are of a penitent heart. You are Perſons of educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
do not you go on in an obſtinate perverſe courſe, for
ſhame of Men, even this ſhame which you now have, and
which you may have when you come to die, a ſanctified uſe
may be made of it, you pay to God ſome part of that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which you owe to him for your ſins. I have no more
to ſay, but the next thing I have to do is, to give the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
the Judgment; which truly I do with as unwilling a
heart as you do receive it. You Priſoners at the Bar, the
Judgment of the Court is this, and the Court doth award
that, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Lord have mercy on your Souls.</p>

                  <p>By the Act of Indempnity (of which
you claim the Benefit, and we ought to take notice of it)
we are to proceed to Judgment, but no Execution of this
Judgment is to be until by another Act of Parliament by
conſent of the King it ſhall be ordered. And therefore I
need not ſpeak any more of that, or any Exhortation to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
your ſelf for Death; our work is only to give Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The Judgment of the Court is this, and the Court
doth award, that you the Priſoner at the Bar be led back
