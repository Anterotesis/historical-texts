            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Giant <hi>Goliah</hi>
so affrighted the

by the vast

and large dimensions of his
spear and armor, with his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying

that none of all that Army

<pb facs="tcp:56808:4"/>
               <hi>David</hi> a Shepherd by
profession, in stature low,
in years young, the least of
all his brethren, and of
meanest account among the
people, took the boldness to
enter the lists with that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcised
Philistim. So
I a spiritual shepherd by
profession, the least of the
Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> little in
my own eyes, and of small
account in the world, obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
how all the host of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
men in this Land look
upon, but adventure not to
<pb facs="tcp:56808:4"/>
buckle with Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>
his <hi>Leviathan, Nec quis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam
ex agmine tanto au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>det

being animated by some lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of the truth, have this
Summer set aside for a
while my other studies, to
peruse this book, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
some of his chief Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
which though erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
and dangerous, are
swallowed down by some
young Sciolists without nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seating;
which to me is an
<pb facs="tcp:56808:5"/>
argument of great distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
in the mindes and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of men, who with the
Israelites loathing the
Manna of true Phylosophy
and Divinity, covet after
the Quailes of new errors, or
rather old in a new guise,
which in the end will poyson
them. Me thinks I see Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and learning, Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and true Phylosophy, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
and piety, for which
this Islaud hath been glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
for many generations,
saying as the voice that the
<pb facs="tcp:56808:5"/>
Christians heard in <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
immediately before the
destruction thereof, <hi>Migre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus

<hi>Palladia,</hi> and as it were the
<hi>Tutelar</hi> gods, by which this
British Empire hath so
long stood, which if they
forsake us, what are we else
but a prey to our enemies:
God grant we may not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of their departure,
as <hi>Aenaeas</hi> did of his <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan</hi>
gods, <hi>Excessere om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
aditis, arisque relictis
Dii quibus imperium hoc
<pb facs="tcp:56808:6"/>
steterat.</hi> For do we not see
how Athism strives to justle
out Religion, how igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
is crawling up into the
chair of learning; how pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is affronted by profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and devotion by irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance;
how divinity is
assaulted by heretical opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and solid Phylosophy
by dreams and fanatical
whimsies. I doubt not but
I shall be blamed by some for
encountring this Champion
of <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> as <hi>David</hi>
was for venturing upon that
<pb facs="tcp:56808:6"/>
Champion of <hi>Gath;</hi> but I
will answer them in <hi>David's</hi>
words. <hi>1 Sam.17. 29. What
have I now done, is there
not a cause? Goliah</hi> defied
the whole host of <hi>Israel,</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> defyeth the
whole host of learned men;
esteeming his <hi>Leviathan</hi> as
formidable and unconque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
as that in <hi>Job 41. 16.
of whose Majesty the
mighty are afraid, and for
fear they faint in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;</hi>
but this <hi>Leviathan</hi>
is not so; For <hi>a Hook may
<pb facs="tcp:56808:7"/>
be cast into his nose, and
his jawes may be pierced
with an angle, Job 40. 21.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, this piece (which makes
its addresses to you, as to
one truly judicious, pious,
and a lover of solid lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning)
is but small; so was
<hi>David,</hi> who notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
foiled <hi>Goliah;</hi> the Ich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neumon
is but a small rat,
yet it can kill the great Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codile;
<hi>in est sua gratia
parvis,</hi> small things have
their magnitude, though not
of bulk, yet of vertue;
<pb facs="tcp:56808:7"/>
there is more nourishment in
a small lark, then in a great
kite or raven; and so there
is more lustre in a small Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amond
then a whole quarry
of other stones; as in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Bee, so in this little
Book there may be much
spirit; <hi>ingentes animos

But how small soever it be,
it hath drawn out <hi>Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi>

a Whale; the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi>

making the three Persons of
the Trinity rather names then
substances. 3. In making Christ
onely to personate God the
Son. 4. In making God the
author of sin. 5. In making
him coporeal, and part of the

Church, [in labouring to

them that dwell in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
that is, the Angels and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
souls, [in making the
one but fancies and dreams,
and the others mortal, and not
capable hereafter of any other
happiness then earthly.] He
tells us besides, [that faith is
not by inspiration, or infusion,
but by study and industry, that
to beleeve in God, is not to
trust in his Person, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
the doctrine. That our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
is in the Church; that they
were not devils, but madmen
which confessed Christ; that
covetousness and ambition,
and injustice with power are
<pb facs="tcp:56808:10"/>
honorable, that tyrants and
good Princes are all one; that
a man may sin against his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science;
that men should not
render a reason or account of
their faith; that Princes are not
subject to their own laws; that
private men have no property
in their goods; that our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
reason is the word of God;
that divine dreams cannot win
belief; that it was a winde, not
the holy Spirit which in the
Creation moved on the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
that the dove and fiery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tongues
may be called Angels;
that Christ hath no spiritual
kingdom here on earth; that
he did not cast out devils, but
onely cured madness; that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
<pb facs="tcp:56808:11"/>
did not enter into <hi>Iudas;</hi>
that we may dissemble in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of religion; that we may
disobey Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
without sin] Such, and
much more like stuff and
smoke, doth this [<hi>Leviathan</hi>
send <hi>out of his nostrils, as out of

            <p>BEing desired by some of my friends a
while ago to peruse Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> his
<hi>Leviathan,</hi> and deliver my opinion of
it. I have done accordingly; I finde him
a man of excellent parts, and in this
book much gold, and withal much dross;
he hath mingled his wine with too much
water, and imbittered his pottage with
too much Coloquintida: there are some
of his positions which may prove of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
consequence, to green heads, and
immature judgments, who look no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then the superficies, or outside of
things, thinking all to be gold that gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
and all wholesome food that is
pleasing to the tast; under green grass
lurch oftentimes snakes and serpents,
such as <hi>Euridice</hi> perceive not, till
they be stung to death; I have therefore
(not to wrong Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> but to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate

            <p>IN His introduction he calls Nature
[<hi>The art whereby God hath made and
governs the World.</hi>] God made not the
world by Nature, for Nature had no
beeing till God made it; and when
he made it, it was neither the exemplary, nor
adjuvant cause of the creation; the world could
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56808:15"/>
not be made by that which had no beeing till it
was made; and when it was made, it was nothing
else but the form and matter of things; the one
being the active, the other the passive nature, and
both but parts of the universe; if again by nature
(that we may make a favourable construction of
his phrase) he meaneth the ordinary power of
God; the world was not made thus: by his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
power he governs it, but by his extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
power he made it, which power is never
called natural, but miraculous; neither again is
<hi>Nature Art,</hi> as he calls it, though both be princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
because Nature is an internal, Art an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
principle; I say external in respect of essence,
though it may be internal in regard of site, albeit
Art, as it is an habit, and in the minde of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer
is altogether external, but take it for the
effect of Art, it may be internal in the thing
made by Art; as may be seen in the motions of
a watch.</p>
            <p>He gives us a bad definition of life, when he
saith: [<hi>Life is but the motion of limbs</hi>] for life is
not motion, but the cause of motion: there may
be life in the limbs when there is no motion, as
in sleep, and in histerical women, and there may
be motion in the limbs without life, as when
they are moved violently by some external mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and there is life where there be no limbs at
all, as in the soul; and there is motion, where
there is no life at all, as in a wooden leg.</p>
            <p>In the first chapter<note place="margin">Part 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> cap. 1.</note> he tells us, [<hi>That the cause of sense is the external object, which
presseth the organ either immediately, as in the
tast and touch, [or imediately as in the other senses</hi>]. The
object indeed is the cause both material and effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
of sensation, but not of sense; that is, of the
act of seeing, but not of the faculty, the soul is
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56808:15"/>
the cause of this; neither doth the object press
immediately upon the organ of tast or touch, but
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mediately, for the organ of tast is the nervous
part of the tongue, the medium is the spungy
flesh, and salival humidity, for the dry tongue
tasteth not: the organ of tact is the nerve, the
medium is the flesh and skin, called Epidemis.
But when he says that [<hi>seeming or fansie is that
which men call sense.</hi>] He makes deception and
sense one thing, for <hi>quod videtur non est;</hi> what
seems to be hath no beeing; therefore in <hi>Euripi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>
mad <hi>Orestes</hi> is counselled by his sister to be
quiet; because saith she, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
thou seest none of those things which
thou supposeth thou seeth or knowest; sense then
is not fancy, for what we fancy we see not, but
seem to see, and what we truly see, we fancy not;
this the Desciples of Christ knew; (<hi>Mat.</hi> 14. 26.)
when seeing him walk on the water, they said, it
is a fancy, for so it is in the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; that
is a sight not real, but imaginary.</p>
            <p>When he speaks of the sensible qualities, he
mentions among the rest [<hi>colour figured</hi>] but what
is that; the thing coloured may be figured, but
that colour should have any figure passeth all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding:
nor speaks he like a Philosopher,
when he saith that [<hi>all sensible qualities are but se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
motions</hi>] Then it must follow, that colours,
heat, cold, siccity, humidity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are motions, but
this is to speak against sense as wel as reason, which
sheweth motions and colours to be distinct enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d when he saith that [<hi>motion produceth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but motion</hi>] He is deceived<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> for motion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
heat, neither is motion produced by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but by the mover: the motion of heaven
was produced by God, not by any antecedent
motion. [<hi>The apparence</hi> (saith he) <hi>of the sensible
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56808:16"/>
qualities to us is fancy, the same waking that drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming</hi>]
this is to confound the work of imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
with that of the outward senses, whereas
the outward and inward senses are distinguished
both in their organs and operations: Fancy then is
the work of the imagination, not of the eye,
ear, nose, tongue, or tact, neither can I yeeld that
the fancy is the same waking that dreaming, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
he means of madmen and fools; but in those
whose brains are not crackt, the fancy receiveth
its species immediately from the common and
outward senses whilest they are awaked, then it
worketh orderly, and is regulated by the will;
whereas in sleep the fancy receiveth the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and as it were the footsteps of the species
from the memory, where they are reserved; so
that then the work of imagination is disordred,
and no waies guided by the will.</p>
            <p>In his second chapter<note place="margin">Part. 1. cap. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> he saith, [<hi>That
the Schools ascribe appetite and knowledge to
things inanimate ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>urdly.</hi>] It seems he is
not well versed in the Schools; for though they
ascribe a natural appetite, or inbred propensity in
things inanimate to preserve themselves, yet they
ascribe no knowledge to them, but in plain terms
affirm, that this appetite is without knowledge:
now that there is in things inanimate a natural
appetite or inclination, is so far from being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd,
that to affirm the contrary were most absurd:
for from whence is it that heavy bodies move
downward, light bodies upward, but from this
natural appetite and inclination? There would
be no generation, if there were not in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
an appetite to the form; neither could there
be motion or action, if there were not an appetite
of entities in possibility, to become entities in act.
[<hi>Imagination</hi> (saith he) <hi>is nothing but decaying
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56808:16"/>
sense, and the sense fading is called memory, so that
imagination and memory are but one thing.</hi>] This is a
riddle which <hi>Oedipus</hi> himself cannot unriddle: doth
the strength of imagination consist in decaying of
sense? It must follow, that dying men must have
strongest fancies, for then sense decays: but if
sense be the generical essence of imagination; how
can the one increase upon the others decay:
doubtless they like <hi>Hyppocrate's</hi> twins, live and
dye together; so that if sense decay, imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
must needs decay, for as he confesseth, <hi>cap.</hi> 1.
[<hi>There is no conception in the minde, which was not at
first begotten upon the organs of sense</hi>] Now that
imagination and memory are not the same thing
is apparent, by their different organs and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the one is in the fore part, the other in the
back part of the head, and for the most part
where the imagination is strongest, the memory
is weakest; and where this is strongest that is
weakest.</p>
            <p>In his third chapter<note place="margin">Part 1. cap. 3.</note> he saith, [<hi>That
things to come have no being at all, the future
beeing but a fiction of the mind</hi>] Have future
Eclipses no beeing then? Sure they have as much
beeing in the intellect, as past Eclipses in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory;
neither are they meer fictions; for that is
properly a fiction which never was, is, nor shall be,
as Centaures, Chimera's, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Had the coming of
Christ no being in the minde of <hi>Abraham,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
he saw that day and rejoyced? Was the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of the Messias in the flesh a meer fiction in
the mindes and hopes of the Patriarchs and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets?
Is faith a fiction, or the resurrection of the
flesh, which is the object of a Christian mans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
the life of his hope, and the supporter of
his soul in affliction; and doubtless in the minde
of God all things are present, and no fiction at all.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56808:17"/>
I like not his phrase, when he calls prophesie,
guessing: for he saith, [<hi>That the best prophet natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
is the best guesser</hi>] guessing is conjecturing,
but prophesies are certain: did <hi>Isaiah</hi> onely guess
when he prophesied that a virgin should conceive
and bear a Son? Gods people were in a very sad
and incertain condition, if prophesying were but
guessing.</p>
            <p>He saith, [<hi>That it is an absurd speech, and taken
upon credit (without any signification at all) from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Philosophers; to wit, that any thing is all in
this place, and all in another place at the same time.</hi>]
Whether is it more absurd to say, that God is all
in this great (<hi>All,</hi>) and all in every part; or to
say, that he is divided into so many parcels, as
there be places in which he is, so that one part of
him is in this place, an other in the other place,
seeing he cannot be all in two places at once: and
is it not less absurd to say, that all the soul is in
each member, then to divide the soul into so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
parcels, as there be members.</p>
            <p>[<hi>There is no other act</hi> (saith he) <hi>of mans minde
naturally planted in him, but to be born a man, and to live
with the use of his five senses.</hi>] To be born a man,
is no act, but a passion; neither is it at all the act
of the minde, but of the man: and to live with
the use of the five senses, is no more the act of a
man, then of a beast. And whereas he saith, that
[<hi>all other faculties are acquired</hi>] He must conclude,
that the faculties of the understanding and will
are acquired, and consequently the soul it
self; for these differ not essentially from the soul.
So when he saith, [<hi>There is nothing in the world
universal but names.</hi>] He will make all predications
of universalities to be meerly nominal, not real:
So that <hi>Peter</hi> is not really a man; nor <hi>Bucephalus</hi>
a horse; nor the <hi>Elme</hi> a tree, but onely in name,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56808:17"/>
which is as much as nothing: so all sciences
which handle universalities are but nominal, and
consequently no real entities are handled in Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physick,
Physick, and Mathematick, but bare
names, seeing these sciences have for their objects
universalities: So when he makes. [<hi>Truth the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
of speech not of things.</hi>] He excludes all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities,
for verity and entity are reciprocal; and it
is ridiculous to think there is not truth in things
as well as in words, for entity can be no more
without truth, then the fire without heat, or the
Sun without light. And when he saith, that [<hi>Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
is the only science which God hath left into man</hi>] He
is injurious to Arithmatick, whose principles are
no less certain, firm, indemonstrable, and evident,
then those of <hi>Geometry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He enveighs much against book learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but in this he speaks without book,<note place="margin">Part 1. cap. 3. 4.</note>
for he calls, in derision, school knowledge
[<hi>Pedantry.</hi>] Pedantry is that knowledge which
is taught to young Scollers; and indeed the best
books are read to them, and they are instructed
in the knowledge of the best things, both in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
and humane litterature: being fit that new
vessels be seasoned with the best liquor. <hi>Quo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>emel
est imbuta,</hi> &amp;c. So the preceps of divinity and
philosophy to this profound Rabbi, whose lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
passeth all understanding, are but Pedantry;
but in speaking against the Schools, he fouls his
own nest: for whence had he the knowledge
which he now rejects, but out of them; as for
his own supposed learning which he hath without
them, it is such, as will never be thought
worthy to be called Pedantry, nor shall it ever
be honoured to be taught in Schools; nor shall
<hi>Aristotle, Plato, Cicero, Thomas,</hi> and other eminent
men need to fear lest Mr. <hi>Hobbs's</hi> whimsies and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56808:18"/>
dreams, thrust their solid and grave learning out of
doors.</p>
            <p>He accounteth these subsequent asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,<note place="margin">Part 1. cap. 5.</note>
absurd; namely, [<hi>That faith is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
or inspired, when nothing can be pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
or breathed into any thing but body, and that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
is body,</hi> &amp;c.] I would know how saith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a gift from without, and not born with us,
should enter into us? If not by inspiration or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion?
And if nothing can be poured or breathed
but body; then it must follow that <hi>Adam's</hi> soul
was a body, for it was breathed into <hi>Adam;</hi> and
that the Holy Ghost is a body, for he is said to be
poured upon all flesh by the prophets, <hi>Ioel</hi> and
<hi>Zachariah:</hi> but if by the spirit be understood spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
vertues or graces, then in Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> his
judgment this will be counted an absurd asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but I hope he hath more Religion in him,
then to think the Holy Scripture speaks absurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
neither is there any absurdity in calling ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension
a body, seeing not a substantial, but a
mathematical body is meant, to distinguish it from
superficies and line.</p>
            <p>He [<hi>will not have colour to be in the body, nor sound
in the air.</hi>] Where then is colour? which is its
subject? is it in a spirit? I know no other subject
in which it can be inherent, except one of these
two: If there be any there, name it; and if
sound be not in the air, how come we to hear it.
He should do well to prove his new assertions, as
wel as to deny the old: so he holds it absurd to say,
[<hi>That a living creature is a genus, or general thing</hi>] But
the contrary is plain, for this proposition [<hi>man is
a living creature</hi>] were absurd, because identical,
if living creature were not a general, but a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
thing; it must also follow that a horse were not
a living creature, or that a man and a horse were
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56808:18"/>
the same particular thing, seeing he admits of no
general thing: any one may see here, whether
the ancient and wise Philosophers, or this new
Misosopher be most guilty of absurdities; neither
is it absurd to say, [<hi>That the nature of a thing is its
definition.</hi>] Seeing man, the thing defined, is the
same with rational creature which is his definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Nor is there absurdity in this speech, [<hi>Mans
command is his will.</hi>] seeing there is no other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
faculty in man but his will; neither are
Metaphors, Tropes, and other Rhetorical figures
absurd speeches; except he will accuse the Holy
Ghost of absurdity, who useth them so frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in scripture: and if these words, [<hi>Hypostatical,
Transubstantiate,</hi> &amp;c.] be absurd words, let him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
better, and more significant terms, and we
shall think him, though not a good Philosopher,
yet a good Grammarian.</p>
            <p>In his sixth chapter<note place="margin">Part 1. cap. 6.</note> he makes [<hi>animal
and voluntary motion the same;</hi>] but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdly,
for the motion of spirits is
voluntary, not animal; and the motion of men
in their sleep is animal, not voluntary; for many
in their sleep speak those words, and perform
those actions, of which they are both ashamed and
afraid when they are awakened: if to speak were
an animal motion, as he saith, then beasts could
speak for they are animals. He saith [<hi>That which
we neither desire nor hate, we are said to contemn.</hi>]
But this is not so, for I neither desire nor hate
the Kingdom of <hi>Persia,</hi> and yet I contemn it not;
whatsoever I hate, I contemn, but I contemn ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things which I hare not.</p>
            <p>When he distinguisheth Religion from Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
I hear the voice of <hi>Leviathan,</hi> not of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian;
For, saith he, [<hi>Fear of power invisible, feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56808:19"/>
not allowed Superstition, and when the power
imagined is truly such as we imagine, true Religion.</hi>]
It seems then both Religion and Superstition are
grounded upon tales and imagination, onely they
differ in this, that tales publickly allowed beget
Religion, not allowed Superstition: but what
will he say of the Gentiles, among them tales
were publickly allowed, were they therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious,
and not superstitious; and is Religion
grounded upon fiction or imagination, even true
Religion? I thought that faith and not imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
had been the substance and ground of things
not seen; that the just live by faith, not by ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
that by faith we are saved; by faith
we are justified; by faith we overcom the world;
not by fancy, fiction, or imagination: We must
mend the Creed, if Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> his religion be true;
and insteed of saying I beleeve in God, we must
say, I imagine, or feign in my minde an invisible
power. In this also he contradicts himself, for
if the power be invisible, how can it be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
seeing (as he saith before) imagination [<hi>is
onely of things perceived by the sense, and it is so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
from the image made in seeing.</hi>

            <p>He will not have the will to be [<hi>a rational appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,
because then there could be no voluntary acts against
reason.</hi>] But the School doctrine stands firm, that
the will is a rational appetite, and that there can
be no voluntary acts against reason, because the
object of the will is a known good; for we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
will or affect what we know not, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

in this he makes the Christian mans happiness ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

same; [<hi>To have faith in, to trust to, and to beleeve a

have made these distinct phrases; for <hi>credere Deo,</hi> is
to beleeve that God is true; <hi>credere Deum,</hi> is to
beleeve there is a God, which wicked men and
evil Angels may do; but <hi>credere in Deum</hi> is to

            <p>He makes Devils, Demoniacks, and
Mad-men to signifie in Scripture the
same thing;<note place="margin">Part 1. cap. 8.</note> for thus he writes: [<hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
many of those Devils are said to confess Christ; Is it
not necessary to interpret those places otherwise, then
that those mad-men confessed him.</hi>] And shortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56808:20"/>
[<hi>I see nothing at all in the Scripture that requires
a belief, that Demoniacks were any other thing but
mad-men.</hi>] Yes, there be divers things that make
it necessary for him to beleeve, that these were
distinct. 1. The letter of the text, from which
we should not digress, except we were urged by an
inconvenience, which is not here. 2. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Church, in which he saith he doth
beleeve. Now the Church alwaies took these for
distinct creatures; to wit, Devils, Demoniacks,
and Mad-men. 3. The honour of Christ; for
wherein was the power of his Divinity seen, if
these were ordinary Mad-men, seeing madness is
curable by physick, and every common Physician.
It tended more to Christ's honour, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
whose Kingdom he came to destroy, should
confess, he divinity, then that mad-men should
acknowledge it. 4. Christ came to call Jews
and Gentiles by working of miracles; but to cast
out Devils, and to cure Demoniacks was a greater
miracle then to cure mad-men. 5. The New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
distinguisheth Demoniacks from mad-men;
for these are called Demoniacks, not mad,
and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is termed mad by the Athenians,
and not a Demoniack: so Devils are never called
mad-men in Scripture, nor madmen called Devils:
besides, as all mad-men are not Demoniacks, so
all Demoniacks are not mad-men; for the Devil
entered into <hi>Iudas</hi> Iscariot, he became a demoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack,
or possessed by the Devil, and yet he was no
mad-man: but, <hi>I</hi> doubt me, Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> is mad
himself, in thinking all learned men to be mad
except himself; he thinks the School-men mad,
because their terms cannot be translated, or are
not intelligible in vulgar languages; by this he
may as well ascribe madness to Lawyers, and
Physitians, as to Divines, for their terms of

easily understand them, nor is it much
material whether they do or not; Church and
State can subsist well enough, though the vulgar
sort understand not the terms of School divinity;
&amp; if these terms are not intelligible by dull heads
and shallow brains; the fault is in themselves, not
in the terms; for <hi>quicquid recipitur ad modum reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientis

must not accuse the Sun of obscurity, because
they cannot see him; neither are the words of
<hi>Suarez,</hi> which he alledgeth for an example, so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
as he would make them, for to an intelligent
man the words are very plain: to wit, [That the
first cause hath no necessary influence upon the
second, by reason of subordination, which is a
help to their working] Here be two things remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
1. That the second causes work by reason
of subordination to the first cause. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. That the
first cause worketh not necessarily upon the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
but voluntarily. If this dish please not
Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> his pallat; he must blame his mouth
which is out of tast, and not the meat which is
both wholesom and savory.</p>
            <p>In his tenth chapter<note place="margin">Part 1. cap. 10.</note> he uttereth strange
Paradoxes. [1. <hi>That to pitty is to disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi>
2. <hi>That good Fortune, if lasting, is
a sign of Gods favour.</hi> 3. <hi>That covetousness of great
riches, and ambition of great honours are honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</hi>
4. <hi>That an unjust action, so it be joyned with
power, is honorable, for honour consisteth onely in the
opinion of power; therefore the heathen gods are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
by the Poets for their thefts and adulteries: and
at first among men, piracy and theft were counted no
dishonour</hi>] 1. Pitty is rather honour then disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
for when a father pittieth his child, a
King his subject, or a Master his servant, do they
dishonour them. When we desire God to pitty
us, do we desire him to dishonour us? him whom
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56808:21"/>
we dishonour we pitty not, and whom we pitty
we dishonour not; pitty proceeds of love disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of hatred. 2. If lasting good fortune be a
sign of Gods favour, it seems then that the Turks
are highly in Gods favour, for their good fortune
hath continued these many hundreth years.
Whether was poor and starved <hi>Lazarus,</hi> or that
rich glutton, who fared dilitiously every day,
highest in Gods favour. 3. Who ever afore Mr.
<hi>Hobbs</hi> made ambition honourable, and covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls the root of all evil.
Can sin be honorable, which brought shame and
dishonour upon mankinde: in respect of sin, man
did not abide in honour, but became like the
beasts that perish. If ambition of great honors
be honorable, then were the evil Angels and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
most honorable, when they affected to be
like God himself, which is the greatest and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
honour that can be: then were <hi>Caligula, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian,
Heliogabalus,</hi> and others who affected di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
honours, most honorable. <hi>Midas</hi> coveted
great riches when he wished all might be gold he
touched, therefore in this he was most honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
but if it be honour to offend God, to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
his law, to incur his displeasure, and suffer
eternal pains; let them who list injoy this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
I will have none of it; <hi>non equidem tali me
digner honore.</hi> 4. He makes [<hi>unjust actions joyned
with power, honourable.</hi>] Then unjust actions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
power deserve no honour; it is even as <hi>Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi>
complaineth in his time, <hi>parva furta puniuntur,
magna in triumphis aguntur.</hi> Petty theeves are han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
but great robberies are honoured. He spoke
it with grief, when a cruel tyrant ruled, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
misruled the Empire. But otherwaies,
where there is government, unjust actions are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
not honoured; and if it were not so,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56808:21"/>
Kingdoms would be nothing else but dens of
theeves, <hi>remota justitia quid aliud sunt regna, quam
magna latrocinia.</hi> All principalities would be tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies;
and indeed where there is greatest power,
there should be most justice; if Princes will be like
God, who is <hi>optimus maximus,</hi> in whom greatness
and goodness have me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> together; to whom much
power is given, of him much justice is required,
<hi>in maxima fortuna minima licentia est.</hi> It is abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
then to make injustice with power honorable;
for honour is the reward of vertue: was <hi>Achab's</hi>
unjust seasing of <hi>Naboths</hi> Vinyard honorable? Or
are the actions of highway robbers, armed with
power, to be honoured? Sure, not in any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Common-wealth where <hi>Themis</hi> raigns, and
<hi>Astrea</hi> hath not again forsaken the earth; but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
injustice may sit as a Queen, and be hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
in <hi>Leviathan's</hi> Republick. [<hi>Vbi prosperum ac felix
scelus virtus vocatur, spontibus parent boni. Jus est
in armis opprimit leges timor.</hi>] There honour may
consist according to Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> his doctrine, in
the opiniou onely of power, without respect had
to vertue and goodness; and so because the evil
Angels are called principalities and powers, they
deserve most honour. But in other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths
were <hi>Leviathan</hi> raigns not, I finde
that goodness is as much honoured as greatness;
piety, justice, temperance, prudence, learning,
and other endowments, are had in no less honour
then the greatest power that is. <hi>Demetrius Phalereus</hi>
had more slatues (to wit, 306.) at <hi>Athens</hi> erected
to him for his eloquence, then ever any of their
most powerful Commanders for theirgreatness:
the Apostles, Martyrs, Confessors, and other emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
men, are honored at this day for their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
not for greatness. <hi>Homer, Aristotle, Virgil, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi>
are in esteem for their learning, not for their
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56808:22"/>
power: and with me <hi>Diogines</hi> in his tub, is in
greater honour, then <hi>Alexander</hi> in his throne. We
honour God not so much for his greatness, (for
so the Devil honours him) as for his goodness;
and the child honoreth his parents, not out of fear
of their greatness, as out of love to their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Honor then doth not meerly consist in the
opinion of power: As for the Poets, commending
their Gods for their thefts and adulteries, and
some barbarous Gentiles honouring theft and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy:
I must confess that Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> is here redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to hard shifts, for supporting his irreligious
Paradox, or Cacodox rather; for by the same
means he may maintain that honour is due to
Garlick, Onyons, Crocodiles, Dogs, Cats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Egyptians worshiped these. What
wonder is it, if theeves and Pirats honour each
other; but the civilised Gentiles were so far from
honouring theft and piracy, that they made se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
lawes against theft, and inflicted condign pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
upon the guilty: As for the Poets com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
the thefts and adulteries of their gods,
they are not to be understood literally but mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,
as I have shewed elsewhere, in <hi>Mystagog.

            </p>
            <p>In his eleventh chapter,<note place="margin">Part 1. cap. 11.</note> he tells us,
[<hi>That felicity is a continual progress of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
from one object to another</hi>] desire is an
inclination of the will, to obtain the good things
we want, or to be rid of the evil with which we
are oppressed: but in neither of these consisteth
felicity; for he cannot be happy which wants
the good which should satisfie him, or is possessed
of the evil which oppresseth him: in heaven
onely is true felicity, because as Saint <hi>Austin</hi> saith,
we shall desire nothing that is absent: if desire be
happiness, then is the covetous man most happy,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56808:22"/>
for he is still desiring more wealth. In true hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
there is love, but neither faith nor hope,
which are the companions of desire: besides, he
makes man in worse condition then the beasts;
for he saith in his twelfth chapter, [<hi>That the feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of beasts consisteth in the injoying of their quotidian
food.</hi>] And yet mans happiness consisteth onely

the Schoolmen brought in Philisophy,

Philosophy should make the Clergy reputed ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,

mankinde, by which his image lost in <hi>Adam</hi> is
repaired; for the understanding is enlightned by

And I pray you good Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> what hurt hath

were all the time hitherto since Christianity was

walk in darkness stumble: How should we come
to know the heavens, the earth, the seas, the
fire, the air, the beasts, fishes, aud fowls, the
hearbs, trees, plants, pretious stones, all which
physical bodies, with divers others are mentioned
in Scripture: besides, Spirits, Angels, and other
Metaphysical entities: without Philosophy, how
should we define, divide, dispute, speak or write
methodically or syllogistically without this. I

and many other Greek and Latin Fathers,
fought against the Gentles, Jews, and Hereticks,
with this sword, and beat them with their own

to condemn the minister and handmaid of divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
between which there can be no more repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy,
then there is between the principal
and subordinate cause, between two lights,

               <note place="margin">Part. 1. cap. 15.</note> [He will have
all men equal by nature, and that <hi>Aristotle</hi>
was mistaken, in saying, that wise men were

strong, and judgments weake, fitter to serve: This
(<hi>he saith</hi>) is against reason and experience; for there

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Though all men be equal by nature, in
regard of the essential perfection of the soul,
yet, in respect of accidental perfections, we finde
the contrary; for some are by nature blind, some
deaf, some dumb, some lame and deformed, some
dull, foolish and stupid. I would know then,
whether a fool whose body is strong &amp; judgment
weak be naturally apter to command, or to serve?
And whether he who is of a weak body, and of
a strong judgment, is not fitted by nature rather
to command then to serve? Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> saith, [<hi>That
there are few so foolish, which had not rather govern
themselves, then be governed.</hi>] But I say that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is not fit for government, is a notorious
fool, if he will rather govern then be governed,
let him think what he will. Had <hi>Phaeton</hi> been a

&amp; quae non viribus illis munera conveniunt.</hi> On
the contrary, wise men have chosen rather to be
Dgoverned by others, then to govern others; and
Christ, the wisdom of the Father, would rather
be a servant then a King. Doubtless, in the state
of innocency, there should have been naturally a
subordination and subjection, as of children to
their parents, of wives to their husbands, and of
inferiours to their superiours; for there should
have been no more equality then among men, on
earth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> than there was, and is in heaven among An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
and in hell among Devils; yea, there is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
subjection among beasts, <hi>rex unus apibus,

by nature, is to say, that there is no
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56808:24"/>
order in nature which cannot be without subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination;
surely, in the state of corrupted na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
to say that all are equal, is to say, that none
have sinned, for sin brought in servitude and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
so that the effect is no less natural then
the cause. Again, whatsoever is necessary, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
natural; but inequality and subordination a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
men, who will live together is necessary,
and therefore natural; we see also, that the body
is naturally subject and subordinate to the soul;
<hi>animae imperio corporis, servitio utimur.</hi> To be brief,
seeing among men, there are many defects and
imperfections, wants and infirmities, and that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally;
there must be also naturally an inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and subjection, by which these defects may
be supplyed; which could not be if all men were
equal by nature: Therefore, not <hi>Aristotle,</hi>

            <p>I like not his phrase,<note place="margin">Part. 1. cap. 16.</note> when he saith,
[<hi>That God was personated first by</hi> Moses, <hi>then
by Christ the Son of man.</hi>] For they that
differ in personality may persononate each other,
but Christ the Son of man differs not in persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
from God, seeing in him the divinity, and
humanity make up but one person; and though
the Father and Son in the Trinity are distinct
persons; yet the Son cannot personate the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
because their nature is numerically one and
the same; neither is it true what he saith, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
covenants, <hi>Part</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 18. [<hi>That they are
but words and breath, and have no force to oblige but
from the sword.</hi>] For covenants are real consents of

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56808:24"/>
or tacite covenants made without words; and
many covenants that have no dependance on the
sword; as those that are made between God and
man. <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> had been but in a bad
condition, if the covenants that God made with
them had been but bare words and breath.</p>
            <p>When he saith,<note place="margin">Part 2. cap. 18.</note> [<hi>That whatsoever the
Prince doth, can be no injury to the subject,
nor ought he to be accused by any of them of
injustice; for he that doth any thing by authority from
another, doth therein no injury to him by whose autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
he acteth.</hi>] This doctrine will hardly down
with free born people, who choose to themselves
Princes, not to tyrannise over them, but like good
shepherds, or fathers of their Country, to rule
them; the people were not mad to give their
power so to Princes, as to be their slaves; or to
think that tyrannical cruelties and oppressions are
not injuries to the subject, or that tyrants must
not be accused of injustice, for although the
Prince acteth by the peoples authority in things
lawful, yet in his lawless exorbitancies, he acteth
by his own tyrannising power, not by the peoples
authority; for they be authors of his lawful po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
yet they are no waies authors of his exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitancies:
and it is ridiculous when he saith,
[<hi>No man can do injury to himself, and that the Prince
may commit iniquity but not injustice or injury.</hi>] For its
too apparent, that most men are too injurious to
themselves, <hi>nemo laeditur nisi à seipso,</hi> O, <hi>Israel,</hi> thy
destruction is of thy self: And I would fain know
what true difference there is between injustice
and iniquity, or injury, for <hi>jus</hi> and <hi>aequum</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the same thing in latine, whence we borrow
the words <hi>injustice, injury, iniquity: I</hi> know some
put a difference between <hi>jus</hi> and <hi>aequum,</hi> but to
little purpose; for doubtless, every injury is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56808:25"/>
and each unjust act is an injury, and an ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
either against God or man; he is also injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to good Princes, when he makes no difference
between them and tyrants, <hi>Part</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 20. [<hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
despotical and paternal dominons, making tyrants
and Soveraigns by institution all one in rights and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences.</hi>]
This is to put no difference between
the Father and Butcher of his Countrey, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Shepherd and the woolf, between sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and fleaing of the sheep. A King governs,
and is governed by laws; a tyrant hath no law
but his will; <hi>jus est in armis, opprimit leges timor.</hi>
This his absurd assertion he would patronise by
Scripture, which describeth to us, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 11,
12. <hi>verses,</hi> the manner of Kings; namely, to take
your sons and daughters to drive his charriot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
To take your fields and Vinyards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But in that
he mistakes himself; for in that chapter the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
describes unto us, not the qualities of Kings,
but of tyrants, such as the neighbouring Nations
had, which dwelt about <hi>Iudea:</hi> but if he will
see the qualities of a good King, and such as the
Lord would chose; let him read the 17. chapter
of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> there he shall finde a King that
must be regulated by the law of God, and not by
his own will.</p>
            <p>So in his twenty one chapter,<note place="margin">Part 2. cap. 21.</note> he will
make us beleeve, that <hi>David</hi> did no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
to <hi>Uriah,</hi> When he killed him; [<hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the right to do what he pleased, was given him
by</hi> Uriah <hi>himself, but the injury was done to God, who
prohibited all iniquity; which distinction</hi> David <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
when he saith, to thee onely have I sinned.</hi>] He
may as well say, that the right to do what <hi>David</hi>
pleased was given him by God, and therefore no
injury in killing <hi>Uriah</hi> was offered to God, which
contradicts his assertion, but indeed neither asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56808:25"/>
is true, for neither God nor <hi>Uriah</hi> gave right
to <hi>David,</hi> to do what he pleased, to say that God
gives to sinful men right to act what they please,
is to make God the author of sin; and to say that
<hi>Uriah</hi> gave right to <hi>David</hi> to kill him, is to make
him accessary to his own murther: And to say, that
a Tyrant doth not wronge the innocent, when
he murthers him causlessly, is to put no difference
between an unjust Tyrant, aud a just Judge, when
he executes a Malefactor deservingly: now when
<hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>To thee onely have I sinned:</hi> he speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
so, because God onely knew his intention,
that he meant to murther <hi>Uriah:</hi> when he placed
him in the forefront of the army.</p>
            <p>He saith, [<hi>That whether a Common-wealth
be monarchical or popular,<note place="margin">Part 2. cap. 21.</note> the freedom is still
the same</hi>] This I deny, for in an absolute
monarchy there is no liberty but meer slavery;
such is the condition of those who live under the
Turk, the <hi>Muscovit, Prester Iohn:</hi> and the <hi>Magol;</hi>
in other governments there is more or less li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
according to the condition of the times,
and people, and the disposition of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors;
for there was more liberty under <hi>Augustus,
Titus, Antoninus, Aurelius,</hi> and other Monarchs
then under many Popular States; <hi>Fallitur egregio
quisquis sub principe credit servitum; numquam libertas
gratior extat quam sub rege pio.</hi> And under Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy
there is at some times more liberty then at
others; to say then, that the freedom under a
Monarchy and Popular government is the same,
is as much, as if I should say, a child is as free
under a rigid and cruel Schoolmaster, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
an indulgent Mother: Where there is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
fear, there can be no liberty; and such
is the condition of those that live under Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:56808:26"/>
He slights <hi>Aristotle's</hi> opinion concerning
Democracy,<note place="margin">Part. 1. cap. 21.</note> for saying there is more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
there, then in any other govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
yet he refels none of <hi>Aristotle's</hi> reasons:
which are these. 1. In Democracy all the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
have a vote in chosing of their Magistrates.
2: All have a right to govern as well as to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned.
3. Magistrates, for the most part,
are chosen by lot, rather then by suffrages.
4. They are not chosen for their wealth. 5. Nor
is the same man chosen often into the Supreme Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
6. Nor may he stay too long in his Office.
7. That Judges are chosen out of all degrees
and orders of the people. 8. That the Supreme
Senate, which is chosen out of all the people,
hath the chief authority over the Common-wealth.
9: That publick officers have their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
and maintenance. 10. That the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
trades of the people are not excluded from
publick offices and honours. 11. By often chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Supreme officers, way is made for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
of many, and occasion of abusing the
Supreme power is taken away. For these reasons
<hi>Aristotle</hi> held there was under Democracy more
liberty, then under Monarchy.</p>
            <p>In his twenty eight chapter<note place="margin">Part 2. cap. 28.</note> he tels us,
[<hi>That the Subject did not give to the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
the right of punishing, and that this
right is not grounded on any concession or gift of the
Subjects.</hi>] These words are plainly contradictory
to what he said before, <hi>cap.</hi> 28. Namely, [<hi>That
the Subject is the author of all the actions and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Soveraign</hi>] And again, [<hi>Every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
man is author of all the Soveraign doth; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
he that complaineth of injury from his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,
complaineth of that whereof he himself is author;
and therefore</hi> David <hi>had right to do what he pleased,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56808:26"/>
given him by</hi> Uriah; <hi>for which cause he did</hi> Uriah
<hi>no injury to kill him</hi>] Here is a plain contradiction.
The subject giveth right to the Prince to do
what he pleaseth, even to murther him; and yet
giveth no power to punish him. Is it likely that
any subject, is so mad, as to covenant with his
Prince, that he shall have right to murther him,
without cause? and yet when he hath just cause,
he shall have no power to punish him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chap.</hi> 28. He saith, [<hi>That mans pride compelled
him to submit himself to Government</hi>] This is a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox;
for mans pride made him rebel against
Government, but not submit to it. Before man
grew proud, he submitted himself to be governed
by God, so did the Apostate Angels; but their
pride made them affect equality with God, and
consequently, rebel, and refuse to obey and to
be governed: it is not pride then, but humility,
that makes man submit to government: For
pride loves to be still uppermost, as the word
sheweth, <hi>superbire quasi superire,</hi> So proud <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traeus</hi>
in <hi>Seneca,</hi> (<hi>Thes. Act.</hi> 5.) <hi>Equalis astris gradior
&amp; cunctos super, altum superbo vertice attingens po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum:</hi>
so the proud man, by the Psalmist is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to a high Cedar in <hi>Lebanus,</hi> and proud <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezar,</hi>
in <hi>Daniel,</hi> to an exceeding tall tree,
whose top reached to Heaven. <hi>Lucifer</hi> in <hi>Isay</hi> 14.
14. saith, <hi>I will assend above the hight of the clouds,
I will be like the most High.</hi> We know that pride
hath been the cause of so much troubles and
wars in the world, because proud men will not
submit to government: <hi>nec ferre potest Caesárve pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orem,
Pompeiúsve parem; Caesar</hi> will not submit
to be governed by <hi>Pompey,</hi> nor <hi>Pompey</hi> by <hi>Caesar:</hi>
Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> might have observed this in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of <hi>Leviathan,</hi> which he alledgeth; for as
<hi>Iob</hi> saith, he seeth every high thing below him,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56808:27"/>
and is King of all the children of pride: and so
he acknowledgeth himself, in the beginning of
the next chapter, that men for want of humility
will not suffer the rude and combersom points of
their present greatness to be taken off.</p>
            <p>In his twenty ninth chapter,<note place="margin">Part. 2. cap. 29.</note> amongst
the diseases of a Common-wealth, which
he saith proceed from the poyson of sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious

The Christian schools and pulpits never held
this, for a disease or seditious doctrine till now;
I beleeve Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> his doctrine is rather sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
for if it be no sin to act against the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,

He then that can act against his conscience with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
sin, or remorse; is one of those the Apostle
speakes of, whose conscience is seared with a hot
iron: and he must needs be miserable, that despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the testimony of this witness, saith <hi>Seneca.</hi>
The Apostle who was no teacher of sedition, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
us that they shall not escape the judgment
of God, who do the same things they condemn
in others, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 3. that is who act against
their conscience; and saith plainly, that to him
who esteemeth any thing unclean, to him it is
unclean, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 14. Therefore that which is
no sin in it self, may be sin to him whose consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
saith it is sin. Hence the Schooles teach us,
that he who acts against an erroneous conscience
sinneth, for by this he is convinced that he hath
a will to sin, and that he can sin deliberately. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
he that acteth against his conscience, acteth
against the law of God, to which he thinks his
conscience conformable. St. <hi>Paul</hi> pleadeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Councel, <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 1. That he had lived
in all good conscience; and in this testimony of
his conscience was his rejoycing, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12. and
wisheth <hi>Timothy</hi> to hold saith and a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
which some putting away, that is, acting
against it, concerning faith have made shipwrack.
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 19. and in the same chapter sheweth,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56808:28"/>
that the end of the commandment is love, out of
a pure heart, a good conscience, and faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained;
for these three are inseparable compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
now whereas Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> saith, [<hi>That this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
dependeth on the presumption of him who makes
himself judge of good and evil.</hi>] I say it is no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,
but a duty imposed on every man to
judge of good and evil, seeing he hath both the
light of nature, and of Scripture to direct him;
and the Apostle sheweth, [that the Gentiles which
have not the law, do by nature the things contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the law, these having not the law, are a
law to themselves, which shew the work of the
law written in their hearts, their conscience
bearing witness, and their thoughts excusing or
else accusing each other, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14, 15.]</p>
            <p>Chapter 29. He will not have faith [<hi>to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by inspiration or infusion, but by study, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi>]
and shortly after he saith, [<hi>That faith is no
miracle, but brought to pass by education, discipline,
correction, and other natural waies,</hi> &amp;c.] That <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
saith was not revealed to him by flesh and
blood, but by the Father of Christ who is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
is plain by our Saviours own words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.
16. And he thanks his heavenly Father for hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the mysteries of faith from the prudent, and
and revealing them to babes, <hi>Mat</hi> 11. 25. For if
faith comes by study, reason, discipline, and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
doubtless the wise Philosophers, and not
the ignorant Fishers had beleeved in Christ; but
we find it other waies: that not many learned (as
the Apostle saith) not many wise, but God hath
chosen the fools and ignorants of this world to
confound the wise and learned; and so Christ
faith, That none can come to him except the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
draw him, <hi>John</hi> 16. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 12. God hath distributed to every man the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56808:28"/>
measure of faith, and confesseth that he obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this mercy of God, to be faithful, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. And
he saith, that we are saved by grace through faith,
not of our selves; it is the gift of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>And indeed if faith came by reason or study,
we may by study attain salvation, justification,
and life eternal; for the Scripture tells us, That
we are saved by faith, and by faith we are justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the just live by faith, and that this hath
been the constant doctrine of the Church from
the beginning, is plain to be seen in the writings
of the Fathers, general and provincial Councels.
Now whereas he saith, [<hi>That faith is no miracle.</hi>]
I say it is a miracle, in that it is a supernatural
gift, so inconsistent with natural reason, that a
holy and ancient Father said, there were three
miracles in Christs Incarnation; to wit, the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the divinity and humanity. 2. Of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
and virginity. 3. Of faith and the heart
of man; but he cannot see [<hi>Why any man should
render a reason of his faith, or why every Christian
should not be also a prophet, or why any man should take
the law of his Country, rather then his own inspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for the rule of his action</hi>] None of these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
will follow, though faith come by
inspiration: For 1. why may not any man give a
reason, that is, render an account as well of an
inspired, as of an acquired faith: St. <hi>Paul</hi> was
inspired, and yet he gives an account of his faith
to the Jewes, <hi>Acts</hi> 22. and to <hi>Agrippa, Acts</hi> 26.
2. What necessity is there, that every Christian
should be a prophet, who hath an inspired faith?
Is faith and prophesie one and the same gift, <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi>
could prophesie and yet was no beleever;
and many in the Primitive Church, beleeved, and
yet could not prophesie. Nor 3ly, is there any
reason why he who is inspired should refuse to be
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56808:29"/>
ruled by the law of his Country, except that law
be repugnant to the true faith with which he is
inspired; for Christ and his Apostles rejected not
the civil law of the Romans, but were in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
things ruled by it; though they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired.
Hence then it appears that these truths
are not pernicious opinions, nor do they proceed
from the tongues and pens of unlearned Divines,<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
as Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> saith, but they are manifest truths,
held by the most learned Doctors of the Church
in all ages.</p>
            <p>Chap. 29. He [<hi>will not have the Soveraign to be
subject to his own laws, because then he should be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to himself, and to set the laws above the Soveraign,
were to set a Iudge above him,</hi> &amp;c.] If a man can
subdue himself, he must be subject to himself, and
as there is no conquest so honorable, so there is
no subjection so profitable as this, <hi>Fortior est qui
se quam qui fortissima vincit maenia, Cicero</hi> tells <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
that he had subdued many fierce Nations, and
conquered divers potent Kingdoms, but in resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of <hi>Marcellus</hi> he had overcom himself, which
was a conquest, that made him not like the most
excellent men, but rather like to God himself. <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius
regnes avidum d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

remotis Gadibus jungas,</hi> &amp;c. What availed it <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
to conquer the world and not to conquer
himself; to be a slave to his vices, and not subject
to his laws. And I pray, why should not a Prince
be as well subject to his own laws, as to his
oaths, covenants, and promises; there is nothing
so honorable for a King, as to keep his word, and
to observe the laws, which he not onely made,
but by oath and promise tied himself to obey.
And surely this is the very law of nature, which

secondly, Because the law is just, not subject to
partiality, passion and affection, as Princes and

far from disobeying their own laws, that they
should be the life and soul of the law, which of

            <p>Cap. 29. He is angry with those who say,
[<hi>That every private man hath a property in his goods.</hi>]
Among the Turks indeed no private man hath any
property at all; under Christian Princes private
men live more happily, who enjoy a property,
yet not simply absolute, if we consider that the
Prince hath a right to our goods in cases of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
as in his own, and Countries defence,
and such like cases, in this regard no man is born
for himself, nor hath any man an absolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
in his own life, which he ought when oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
urgeth, lay down for his Country: <hi>Dulce
&amp; decorum pro patria mori;</hi> therefore <hi>Plato</hi> saith
well, That our Country requires a share in our
birth; the property then of the subject exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
not the Princes right in cases of necessity,
but onely his arbitrary power. Hence are these
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56808:30"/>
sayings, <hi>Omnia rex imperio possidet, singuli dominio;</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<hi>Ad reges potestas omnium pertinet ad singulos pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietas.</hi>
The power here spoke of is meant of his just
&amp; lawful, not of his arbitrary &amp; tyrannical power.</p>
            <p>In his thirty one chapter<note place="margin">Cap. 31.</note> he makes a
needless distinction between the objects of
love, hope, and fear, shewing, [<hi>That love hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to goodness; hope and fear to power; the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of praise is goodness, the subject of magnifying and
blessing is power.</hi>] <hi>David</hi> knoweth no such distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
who in the 18. <hi>Psalm</hi> he loves God for his
strength or power, and in another Psalm, he fears
him for his mercy, or goodness, <hi>There is</hi> (saith
he) <hi>mercy with thee, therefore shalt thou be feared:</hi>
So he makes Gods goodness, and not his power
the object of his hope or belief; <hi>Psal.</hi> 27. <hi>I hoped
to see the goodness of God in the land of the living;</hi> so
likewise he praiseth God for his strength or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
as well as for his goodness: <hi>Praise him,</hi>
saith he, <hi>for his mighty acts, praise him for his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
greatness, Psal.</hi> 150. and in divers Psalms he
magnifyeth God for his salvation, as well as for his
power. Now when he saith, that this name
(<hi>God</hi>) [<hi>is his own name of relation to us,</hi>] he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
for this is no name of relation at all;
his names of relation to us, are, Creator, Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
Father, Lord, King, Master, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In his third Part and Chap. 1.<note place="margin">Part 3. cap. 32.</note> He saith,
[<hi>That our natural reason is the undoubted word
of God.</hi>] But I doubt <hi>Leviathan</hi> himself for
all his great strength and power, cannot make
this good; for Gods word is infallible, so is not
our natural reason, which faileth in many things.
Gods word saith, That a Virgin did conceive and
bear a Son; That God became man; That our
bodies shall rise again out of the dust; but our
natural reason saith, this is impossible: therefore
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56808:30"/>
when St. <hi>Paul</hi> preached the resurrection to the
<hi>Athenians,</hi> who wanted not natural reason enough,
they thought he had been mad. How comes it
that the Apostle saith; <hi>The natural man understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
not the things of Gods spirit;</hi> And Christ tells
<hi>Peter,</hi> That flesh and blood, (that is) natural
reason had not revealed the mystery of his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to him, but his Father in Heaven; and St.
<hi>Paul</hi> saith, That he received not the Gospel of
man, nor was he taught it but by the revelation
of Jesus Christ, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 12. And that he was not
taught by mans wisdom, but by the Holy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Ghost,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 13. How comes it I say, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
speaks thus in villifying natural reason, if it
be the infallible word of God; yea, what need
was there of any written word at all if our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
reason be that infallible word: doubtless
<hi>Adam</hi> by his fall lost much of his knowledge and
natural reason; <hi>Peter</hi> made use of his natural rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
when he undertook to disswade Christ from
going up to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and there to suffer and die;
but Christ tells him that he favoured the things
that be of men, but not of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 23. Our
natural reason, saith he, <hi>cap.</hi> 32. [<hi>Is a talent not to
be folded up in the napkin of an implicit faith.</hi>] This
I grant; but I hope he will permit, that our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
reason, be subject to an explicit faith, without
which it is impossible to please God; and not
onely must our reason be subdued to faith; but
every imagination in us must be cast down, and
every high thing that exalteth it self against the
knowledge of God, and every thought must be
brought into captivity, to the obedience of Christ,
2. <hi>Cor:</hi> 10. 5. And whereas he saith, <hi>cap:</hi> 32. [<hi>That our
reason must be imployed in the purchase of justice, peace,
and true religion.</hi>] If reason could procure or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
these blessings, the Gentiles of old, the Jews
and Mahume<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ans of latter years might have had
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56808:31"/>
them as well as we; for in natural reason they are
not inferior to us; every one of these following
the dictates of reason, think they have the true
Religion; as for justice and peace they can never
be purchased by reason, but by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aith; therefore
saith the Apostle: being justified by faith, we
have peace with God through Jesus Christ our
Lord, but his reason by which he would prove,
that our natural reason is the undoubted word of
God, is very feeble; for saith he, [<hi>There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
contrary to it in Gods word.</hi>] By the same
means he may prove that <hi>Aristotle's</hi> Logick, or
<hi>Hippocrate's</hi> Aphorisms are the undoubted word of
God; for in them is nothing contrary to it. But
was not <hi>Peter's</hi> reason contrary to Gods word,
when he would have disswaded Christ from suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering;
whereas all the prophets had spoken, that
Christ ought to have suffered those things, and to
enter into his glory; <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 26.</p>
            <p>And no less weak is his argument (<hi>cap.</hi> 32.)
by which he will prove, that divine dreams [<hi>are
not of force to win belief from any man, that knows
dreams are for the most part natural, and may proceed
from former thoughts,</hi> &amp;c.] He may as well infer,
that the pen-men of the Holy Scriptures are not
of force to win belief from us, seeing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
saith, All men are lyers: what if it had said,
that men for the most part are lyers; there had
been less reason to have inferred that the pen-men
of Scriptures were such, and yet Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> will
infer, that because dreams are for the most part
natural; therefore divine dreams are of no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
that such dreams are of force sufficient to
win belief, is plain by the dreams of <hi>Ioseph; Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob's</hi>
son, and <hi>Ioseph</hi> the husband of <hi>Mary:</hi> with
divers others in Scripture. (<hi>cap.</hi> 33.) He is
troubled that <hi>Moses</hi> before his death should write
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56808:31"/>
that he died, &amp; that his Sepulcher was not known
to this day, but in this he troubles himself need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessly;
for he writes of his death and sepulcher
by anticipation, which is an usual way of writing,
amongst some, besides the Jewish tradition is,
that <hi>Iosua</hi> wrote that last chapter of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi>
long after the death of <hi>Moses.</hi> (<hi>Cap.</hi> 33.) So he
is troubled about the words of <hi>Moses, Gen.</hi> 12. 6.
which are, <hi>And the Canaanite was then in the land;</hi>
Hence he infers, that <hi>Moses</hi> wrot not that book,
but one who wrot when the Canaanite was not in
the land, for <hi>Moses</hi> dyed before he came to it:
but I say, that if the Canaanite was not in the
land, when he wrot these words, <hi>The Canaanite
was then in the land;</hi> he wrot a lye; but indeed
<hi>Moses</hi> wrot the History, and writes no waies ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdly,
in showing that the Canaanite was then in
the land, but purposely to let us see the condition
of Gods children in this life, who though they
have right to all they enjoy, yet the wicked keep
them under, and they live in fear still of their
enemies, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did of the Canaanites, who
domineered in that land which <hi>Abraham</hi> received
from God, and at the same time he receiv'd it; such
like exceptions he makes against some other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the old Testament, but they are of no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or validity, therefore I will spend no paper
nor time in their refuration.</p>
            <p>In his thirty fourth chapter<note place="margin">cap. 34.</note> he tells
us, [<hi>That there is no real part of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
which is not also a body, and that bodies are
called substances, because subject to various accidents,
and that an incorporeal substance, is as if a man should
say, an incorporeal body.</hi>] If there were no real parts
of the universe but bodies, then the universe
were not universe, but an imperfect system, as d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:56808:32"/>
to wit, incorporeal substances; but God made the
world perfect, consisting both of material and
immaterial substances; such are Angels and Mens
souls, which are neither corporeal in their bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
nor operation; for if they were corporeal,
they must be mortal and corruptible, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
at least of matter and form, they must
be also quantitative, local by circumscription,
and movable by physical motion; all which are
absurd: and if a substance be the same that a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
is, then he must make God corporeal, for he
is a substance: now to say that a thing is called
substance, because subject to changes, is vain;
for substances are so called, because they subsist by
themselves, and not in another entity, as acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
do: besides, accidents may be called sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
because one accident may be the subject of
another, as the superficies of a wall is the subject
of colours; but accidents can never be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
substances, for they cannot subsist of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>By the spirit of God moving upon the face of
the waters, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 2. [<hi>He will have to be meant a
winde, because if God himself were understood, then
motion must be attributed to him and place.</hi>] I know in
this he follows <hi>Tertullian's</hi> opinion; but the
Church hath constantly held that there is meant,
not a winde, but the spirit of God; by which
place they both prove the mystery of the Trinity;
the first person being expressed by the word <hi>Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>m,</hi>
the second by the word <hi>Berisheth,</hi> or <hi>Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi>
and the third by the word <hi>Ruah,</hi> or <hi>Spirit;</hi>
they also by the same place prove the dignity and
power of baptism, in the waters of which Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the Spirit moveth as in the beginning; and
indeed it is childish to think that a winde should
be there meant, for what use could there be of a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56808:32"/>
winde then, before the creatures were produced.
And wheras he is afraid to ascribe motion and
place to God, it seems he hath not well observed
the Scripture phrase, which ordinarily speaketh
of God, <hi>Anthropopathos,</hi> as if he were a man;
therefore he is said sometimes to speak, to see, to
hear, to discend, to laugh, to be angry, to greet,
to rejoyce; and in this History of the Creation,
he is said, to speak, to bless, to walk in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
to examine <hi>Adam,</hi> to condemn the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now whereas Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> saith, that the
spirit here mentioned, is the same that is spoken
of, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8. 1. <hi>I will bring my Spirit upon the Earth:</hi>
He is mistaken, and misalledgeth the words; for
thus it is written, <hi>And God made a winde to pass o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Earth;</hi> for winde in Scripture is never cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Spirit of God. The spirit then that dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up the waters of the flood, was the same that
afterwards divided the red Sea for <hi>Moses</hi> and the
Israelites to pass through; to wit, a drying winde
which God had raised: He saith, [<hi>The word</hi> Ghost
<hi>signifieth nothing but the imaginary inhabitants of the
brain.</hi>] But there he is also mistaken, for it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
a real immaterial substance, which we call
from the Latin word, <hi>Spirit;</hi> and so it was alwaies
used by the Saxons, and at this day, <hi>Gheest</hi> and
<hi>Gheist</hi> in low and high Dutch do signifie the same
thing or spirit.</p>
            <p>Cap. 34. When Christ walked on the waters,
the Disciples thought they had seen a spirit or fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasm,
which Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> will have [<hi>to be an aerial
body.</hi>] But I wonder who ever saw an aerial body;
the two grosser Elements are visible to us, but not
the two superior, by reason of their subtilty and
purity. And he is deceived also in saying, [<hi>That
the delusions of the brain are not common to many at
once.</hi>] For I have observed that divers men toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56808:33"/>
have seen imaginary castles, temples, armed
men, and such like apparitions in the clouds.
Now Spirits or Angels have been seen not in their
own substances, which are invisible, but in the
bodies of men which they assumed; and to say,
as he doth, that because spirits are in no place
circumscriptively, therefore they are no where,
is inconsequent; for though they have no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentions
answering to the demensions of place,
yet they have their <hi>vbi,</hi> to which they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sined.</p>
            <p>Cap. 34. He saith, [<hi>That concerning the creation
of Angels, nothing is delivered in the Scriptures.</hi>]
What then means the Apostle in his Epistle to
the Collossians by things invisible, thrones, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations,
and powers, which he saith, were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?
Were not these Angels? But I wonder not
that he denies the creation of Angels, for he
doeth plainly deny their existence, saying (<hi>cap.</hi>
34.) they are [<hi>but visions, apparitions, images in
the fancy, accidents of the brain.</hi>] But when the
Holy Scripture calleth Angels Messengers, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
ministring spirits, the hoast of heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Doeth it mean onely our fancies and dreams?
Are those celestial servants of God, the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and protecters of good men, the gatherers
together of the elect in the last day, but imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations?
Was that a fancy or an Angel who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
<hi>Hagar</hi> in the desert? Was the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi>
that appeared to <hi>Mary</hi> but an accident of her
brain? Were not the Israelites well guarded from
their enemies, when they had no Angels, but
fancies to guard them? It seems that <hi>Abraham</hi>
and <hi>Lot</hi> entertained not Angels, but dreams and
fancies in their houses; and <hi>Abraham</hi> washed the
feet of fancies, and for them killed his fat calf: and
<hi>Iacob</hi> wrestled all night with a fancy; as <hi>Turnus</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:56808:33"/>
did, in the Poet, with the shaddow of <hi>AEnaeas.</hi>
Were those fancies or real substances, that St.
<hi>Iude</hi> speaks of, who kept not their first estate, but
left their habitation, and are now reserved in
chains under darkness for the judgement of the
great day: and when Christ saith wee shall be
like the Angels, doeth he mean that in heaven
we shall be like fancies and dreams? I doubt me,
Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> is possessed with too many such Angels:
He is extreamly extravagant in his discourse for
the Angels, which but now he would have to be
dreams, visions, and fancies, he will have to be
God himself. (<hi>cap.</hi> 34.) [<hi>Because the same appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is called, not onely an Angel, but God,</hi> Gen. 16.]
Here is a goodly argument: Angels are somtimes
called God, therefore they are God indeed: by
the same reason he may infer, that Judges and
earthly Princes, are gods indeed, because they
are called so. The Idols of the Gentiles are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
gods, are they therefore Gods indeed: An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
are sometimes called <hi>Elohim,</hi> or gods; not only
for the excellency of their nature, but likewise
for their imployment, in representing the person
and authority of God in their embassies: that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,
who <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. 13. calls himself <hi>the God of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel</hi>
is thought to be our blessed Saviour, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
sometimes to the Patriarchs and other ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men, before his incarnation: and it was this
Angel that spake with <hi>Moses</hi> in the bush, and in
the cloud; and not the cloud it self; as Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>
thinks, for he is deceived in thinking that the
cloudy piller spoke with <hi>Moses.</hi> He says, [<hi>It is
not the shape, but the use that makes them Angels.</hi>]
indeed the shape of men was most usual and most
useful in the Angels, for contracting familiarity
with men; for which cause the Angel of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venunt
in the fulness of time became man: for
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56808:34"/>
what can be so kindly to man, as to be instructed,
directed, and defended by man, or by Angels in
mans shape: He saith, [<hi>That the Dove and fiery
tongues, in being signes of Gods special presence may be
called Angels.</hi>] But I say no; for it is not the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
of Gods presence, but the delivering
by speech Gods will or message, that makes an
Angel or Messenger; for when were dumb Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
ever imployed? If every sign of Gods
presence were an Angel, we should have as many
Angels, as there be Ceremonies and Sacraments
in the Church: yea, every creature were an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,
for each creature testifieth and representeth
to us a Diety, and so every Star, yea, every Fly,
and every Herb should be an Angel, <hi>praesentemque
docet quae libet herba Deum:</hi> if he can tell us that
the fiery tougues, or Dove, did ever deliver any
message in Scripture, (which the Poets fable of
<hi>Dodonas</hi> Doves) then I will call them Angels.
He saith again, [<hi>That God needeth not to distinguish
his celestial servants by names.</hi>] Will he hence infer
that therefore they have no names; he may as
well say, that God needeth not to distinguish men
by names, or to call the stars by their names, <hi>Psal.</hi>
147. Angels are distinguished by names, not for
him, but for our weak memories: God needs no
such distinctions, but we who are of weak appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions.</p>
            <p>Cap. 34. He faith, [<hi>That fire is no punishment to
impatible creatures, such as are all things incorporeal.</hi>]
That the Devil shall be punished with eternal fire
and his Angels, is plain by our Saviours words,
Mat. 25. It follows therefore they are patible
creatures, though immaterial: that there is a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability
in immaterial substances, is manifest by
our own souls, which are affected with the passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of joy and grief, as the body is in a joyful or

in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> painful condition; there are also some passions
which are called immanent, and immaterial, such is
the passion of understanding; for the soul suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
when it understandeth. Now how the evil
spirits in hell suffer by fire is not known unto us,
but to God; neither is their suffering natural,
but altogether supernatural, and by the power of
God, who can as easily make fire work on spirits,
as on the bush which burned, but consumed not:
as St. <hi>Austin</hi> sheweth, <hi>de civit dei, lib.</hi> 21. <hi>cap.</hi> 10.
When Christ saith, that in the resurrection we shal
be like the Angels of God which are in heaven.
Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> inferreth, (<hi>cap.</hi> 34.) [<hi>That because men
then shall be corporeal, therefore the Angels are such.</hi>]
This is not to shew that we shall be like the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
as Christ saith, but that the Angels shall be
like us: neither is it Christs scope to shew there,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 30. that we shall be like the Angels in
every thing; but onely in this, that we shall be
like them in chastity; for there shall be no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying,
because no need of posterity, man being
then immortal. He confesseth at last, (<hi>cap.</hi> 34.)
[<hi>That though in the Old Testament Angels were but
fancies; yet some places of the New Testament have
extorted from his feeble reason; a belief that Angels
are substantial and permanent.</hi>] That faith which is
extorted from a feeble reason must needs be very

which Christ hath obtained for his Saints shall be: on
earth: because the Apostle saith, as in</hi> Adam <hi>all dye,
even so in Christ shall all be made alive, for else the
comparison were not proper.</hi>] The comparison is not
between the two places of heaven and earth, but
between the two persons of <hi>Adam</hi> and Christ,
and between the two lives, the one earthly which
<hi>Adam</hi> lost by introducing mortality, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
heavenly which Christ hath purchased by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercoming
mortality: and as this place fails him,
so doth that other, <hi>Psal.</hi> 133. 3. Upon Sion God
commanded the blessing, even life for evermore.
And <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 2. <hi>I Iohn saw the holy City, New</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem
<hi>comming down from God out of heaven.</hi> And
<hi>Acts</hi> 1. 11. <hi>This same Jesus who is taken up from you

into heaven.</hi> And <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. In the resurrection
they are as the Angels of God in heaven, for they
neither marry, nor are given in marriage. What
sober minded man will conclude from these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that our eternal hapiness shall be on earth,
and not in heaven? For when <hi>David</hi> speaks of
life for evermore in <hi>Sion,</hi> he means a lasting hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
which accompanies concord among bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren:
for the Hebrew word <hi>Holam</hi> in Scripture,
signifieth a continuance for some time, but not
eternity: In <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 6. The servant whose

<hi>Samuel</hi> is said to appear before the Lord, and

office for all eternity: The Perpetuus Dictator at

onely true and eternal life: As impertinent is
that place which he alledgeth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>To him
that overcometh I will give to eat of the tree of life,
which is in the midst of the Paradise of God.</hi> This
saith he, [<hi>was the tree of</hi> Adams <hi>eternal life, but
this life was to have been on earth.</hi>] But he is quite
out of the way; for the Paradise mentioned
here, is that which Christ speaks of to the good
thief, <hi>Thou shalt be this day with me in Paradise,</hi>
that is in heaven: for earthly Paradise was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
by the flood, and so was the tree of Life,
which might for some time have prolonged
<hi>Adams</hi> age, by supplying the decay of the radical
moysture, but could not have continued it for
ever: only our blessed Saviour the true tree of life
here mention'd can protract our life into eternity:
now that Paradise was destroyed by the flood is
plain by <hi>Moses, Gen.</hi> 6. saying, that the flood rose
higher fifteen cubits, then the highest mountains.
Besides, if Paradise had been to continue what
need was there to build an Ark for <hi>Noah:</hi> and
his family, seeing they could have been saved in
Paradise, and so the other creatures likewise:
And whereas he saith, [<hi>That the New</hi> Jerusalem
<hi>when Christ comes again; shall come down to Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
from heaven, and not they go up to it from earth.</hi>]
Is ridiculous; for <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 2. by the New <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
coming down from God, is meant the Church
of Christ, whose original calling, protection, and
happiness is from God, so that this is not a proper,
but a tropical discent. The Church is called <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi>
there, and elsewhere, because she is, or
ought to be the City of Peace, and as <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
of old was the place of Gods worship, and of his
peculiar presence, so is the Church now; which
is called new, as having cast off the old man, and
old ceremonies, is renewed in the spirit of her
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56808:36"/>
minde; and is regenerate by water and the spirit
So he sheweth his vanity, when he proves out
of <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 11. [<hi>That Christ shall come down to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
his people eternally here, and not take them up to
govern them in heaven.</hi>] For in that place there is
no mention of his government here on earth, nor
of the eternity thereof; but onely that he shall
return after the same manner that he went up, that
is to say, gloriously, riding on the clouds, and
attended by Angels: Now if any man would
know the reason or end of Christs second coming,
he shall finde in <hi>Daniel</hi> 2. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. and other
places of Scripture; that it is not to erect an
earthly Kingdom, which shall continue for ever,
but as the Apostle saith, to render vengeance to
the wicked, and to us that are afflicted, peace.
Or as it is in our Creed, to judge the quick and
the dead; so then he shall not return as an earthly
Prince, to set up his throne here on earth, which
is his foot-stool, but as a Judge in his circuit,
who having condemned some, and absolved
others, returns again to the place of his resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>But he says, (<hi>cap.</hi> 38.) [<hi>That there is neither
Scripture nor Reason to prove that after the resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
men are to live eternally in heaven.</hi>] What then
will he say to these passages, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>Great is your
reward in heaven;</hi> Christ would have said, great
is your reward on earth, if he had purposed to
erect an earthly kingdom. So <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. we are advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to lay up our treasures, not on earth, but in
heaven: this were to no purpose, if we were to
live eternally on earth, not in heaven. So <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.
<hi>I go to prepare a place for you, that where I am, there
you may be.</hi> I pray was it not to heaven that
Christ went to prepare that place: is not heaven
his Fathers house, where there are many manti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56808:36"/>
Earth is never called his house, nor are the
Saints said here to have an house or habitation,
but to sojourn as in Tents: Heaven is the house
where we must dwell, if we will beleeve St.
<hi>Paul</hi> who was caught up into this house, who
speaks not by hearsay, but by knowledge: [for
we know, saith he, that if our earthly house of
this Tabernacle were dissolved, we have a buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of God, an house not made with hands e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
in the heavens, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1.] Why did St. <hi>Paul</hi>
desire to be dissolved and be with Christ, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.
if he was to enjoy Christ upon earth onely: he
should rather have desired to be dissolved, that
Christ might be with him on earth, then he to
be with Christ in heaven: <hi>Enoch</hi> was translated,
and <hi>Elijah</hi> was caught up into heaven, to assure
us of our right and habitation there, for this
cause our Saviour opened heaven at his Baptism,
and after his Resurrection ascended thither, to
take possession thereof for us; and it is fit, that
where the Head is, there the body should be;
where the King keeps his residence, thither his
servants should repair. Where should the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
dwell, but in their Fathers house: now that
is heaven; therefore we are taught to lift up our
eyes thither, and to pray, <hi>Our Father which art in
Heaven.</hi> Here then Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> hath both authority
and reason against his earthly happiness, which

God, whose Throne is in heaven.</hi>] I would know of
Mr. <hi>Hobbs;</hi> Whether our King, Christ Jesus be
not God now, as well as after the resurrection,
and whether his Throne be not now in heaven,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56808:37"/>
as well as it shall be then. If so, why may not
each earthly kingdom now be called the Kingdom
of heaven, seeing our King is God, and his

Christ is God, but not King as yet; but I say, in
that he is God, he is also King of all the earth, as

King of Kings; and therefore he confesseth
before his earthly Judge that he was born to be a
King. And when he was hanging on the Cross
he was King of the Jews. To no purpose also
doth he alledge that of St. <hi>Iohn, cap.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 13. [<hi>No
man hath ascended into heaven, but he that came down
from heaven, even the son of man that is in heaven.</hi>]
To prove that man shall ascend to his happiness
no higher then Gods foot-stool, the earth: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
no man hath ascended into the highest hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
before Christ, will it therefore follow, that
no man shall ascend after him; or because no man
hath ascended by his own power, but Christ one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
therefore no man shall ascend by the power
of Christ thither: he were as good infer, that no
man before Christ overcame death by his own
power, therefore no man after him shall overcom
death by Christs power; and consequently there
shal be no resurrection. But if we ascend not higher
then the earth, the Apostle hath deluded us, in
saying. That we shall be caught up together in
the cloudes, to meet the Lord in the air, and so
we shall be ever with the Lord: he should have
said rather, that the Lord shall be ever with us.

                  </gap> for they all
live to him, Luke</hi> 20, 37, 38. His reason is, because
the words are to be understood onely of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
of the soul: But I say these words
prove both the souls immortality and the bodies
resurrection; for if <hi>Abraham's</hi> soul had been dead,
how could God have been his God: that is, his
Protector, Comforter, Saviour? Here is the souls
immortality. And if <hi>Abraham's</hi> body had been
eternally dead, how could God have been the
God of <hi>Abraham;</hi> for <hi>Abraham's</hi> soul is not <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
but a part; now God is not the God of
a part, but of the whole man: therefore St.
<hi>Luke</hi> saith, <hi>They all live to God;</hi> the departed Saints
then are no more dead to God, then our children
when they are asleep, are dead to us: Therefore
Christ saith of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> being four daies dead,
that he was asleep; so our departed friends are
dead to us, but asleep to God: and indeed the
souls immortality, and bodies resurrection are so
linked together, that who denieth or affirmeth
the one, denyeth or affirmeth the other; neither
had Christ's answer satisfied the Sadduces, had it
not proved as well the resurrection of the body,
as the immortality of the soul; for they denied
both.</p>
            <p>[<hi>It is not</hi> (saith he) <hi>apparent in Scripture, that
mans soul is in his own nature eternal.</hi>] That the
soul is immortal, is apparent by these Scriptures,
<hi>Eccles.</hi> 12. 7. <hi>The spirit shall return to God that gave it.</hi>
If it dyeth, how can it return to God? It returns
rather to nothing: So <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 28. <hi>Fear not
them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the
soul.</hi> If the soul cannot be killed when the body
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56808:38"/>
is destroyed, how comes it to dye? So <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.
32. <hi>God is the God of Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>not of the dead
but of the living.</hi> So <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 23. <hi>Paul</hi> desireth to
be dissolved, and to be with Christ. When he is
dissolved, his body could not be with Christ; it
is his soul then; which to be with Christ, is to
live with Christ. So 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 19. Christ went
and preached to the spirits in prison. What did
he preach to dead spirits? So <hi>Revel.</hi> 6. 9. The
souls cry under the Altar, and 7. 9. They are clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
in white, with palms in their hands; those
phrases do not speak of dead souls. But he would
fain prove out of <hi>Iob</hi> 14. 7. That life immortal
beginneth not in man, till the resurrection. But
this place will advantage him nothing: for we say
the same with <hi>Iob,</hi> That a tree being cast down
will bud again, and that man riseth not till the
heavens be no more; that is, till the resurrection,
when the heavens shall be dissolved with fire, as
St. <hi>Peter</hi> saith; so that life immortal beginneth
not in man till then; if by man he means the
whole man. But hence is no argument that can
be drawn against the immortality of the soul:
for though man dye and consume, yet the soul
dieth not; no more then the soul eateth, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
sleepeth, walketh, &amp;c. for these are the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the man, not of the soul.</p>
            <p>Because Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> (<hi>cap.</hi> 38.) thinks [<hi>this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine

And Christ descended into hell; all which
shew that it is beneath us; and this visible

            <p>Because the Prophets in the old Testament by
allegorical terms describe the happiness of Christs
Church under the Gospel; therefore Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>
will needs (<hi>cap.</hi> 38.) have these phrases to be
understood of an earthly kingdom after the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;
but the Prophets speak of pleasant ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
and fields, of woods and groves, of horses
and charriots, of eating and drinking, and all
kinde of earthly delights; which if Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>
understand literally, I shall think his opinion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisheth
too much of the <hi>Alcoran;</hi> and that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viveth
again the heresie of <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> which the
Fathers of the Church hath long since exploded;
as being too gross and carnal, and such as none
will beleeve but carnal men: <hi>Nulla modo ista possunt,
nisi a carnalibus credi,</hi> as St. <hi>Austin</hi> saith, <hi>l.</hi> 20. <hi>de
civit.</hi> c. 7. The kingdom of God consisteth not in
meat and drink, saith the Apostle; the words
that they speak are spirit and truth; and are spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually
to be understood: if we shall be like the
Angels after the resurrection, as our Saviour as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
us, what other delights can we have then,
but such as they enjoy now; why should not
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56808:39"/>
heaven be the place of our abode as well as
theirs; they need not the earth to reside in now,
neither shall we then. But he saith, [<hi>That the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of God should have any place higher then his foot-stool,
seemeth not sutable to the dignity of a King.</hi>] It
may be so Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> of you speak of earthly
Kings, who pride themselves in their supposed
greatness, and stand upon punctilios: but it is not
so with the King of heaven, who made no scruple
to wash his servants seet; and to tell them, that
they should sit with him upon twelve thrones,
to jude the twelve tribes of <hi>Israel.</hi> And assures
us, that he will grant to him who overcometh,
to sit down with him in his throne; even, as I
(saith he) also overcame, and am set down with
my Father in his throne, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 21. And St. <hi>Iohn</hi>
tells us, that Christ hath made us kings and priests
unto God and his Father, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 6. It will not
then be unsutable to his dignity, if we ascend
higher then his footstool.</p>
            <p>In his forty one chapter<note place="margin">cap. 41</note> he tells us,
[<hi>That the Kingdom of Christ is not to begin
till the general resurrection.</hi>] What hath Christ been
all this while a King without a Kingdom; or
hath his Church been all this time a people
without a King; sheep without a Shepherd, a
body without a head? Are Christians in a worse
condition then other people? And is not Christ
highly wronged, who having conquered a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
with his blood, and having got the victory
over all his enemies; is notwithstanding now
1652. years without his kingdom; and must be
without it till the general resurrection. How can
this stand, that he should so many yeers since by
his Apostles and their successors subdue so many
nations to his obedience, by that sharpe two edg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56808:40"/>
have no kingdom; could <hi>Alexander</hi> in three yeers
space subdue so many kindoms: and Christ after
so many hundred years be without his kingdom;
what is become of his rod of Iron, by which he
was to rule the stubborn Gentiles? How can this
stand, that he ascended up on high, led captivity
captive, and gave liberal gifts to men; yea, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise

               </gap> and inflicted divers
punishments, and yet is no King? he confesseth
to <hi>Pilate,</hi> that he was even at that time a King,
when he stood before him, ready to suffer death
for his subjects: but withal acknowledgeth, that
his kingdom was not of this world, and therefore
refuseth to be an earthly king. When Satan
profferred him all the kingdoms of the world,

King, he absented himself. If he was a King in

or punishments which his subjects have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.
Shall we say, that <hi>David</hi> was not king,
because he did not reward <hi>Ioab, Shimei,</hi> and the
sons of <hi>Barzillai</hi> according to their works, but
left that to his son <hi>Solomon,</hi> both to reward <hi>Barzil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lai's</hi>
sons for their good service to <hi>David</hi> in his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
and to punish <hi>Iob</hi> with death, for the
murthering of <hi>Abner</hi> and <hi>Amasa;</hi> and likewise
<hi>Shimei,</hi> for his railling against the king. There
is a time for all things; even for punishments and
rewards; and if the differing of these do argue
no king, he may then as well say, that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56808:40"/>
is no King, who differred the drowning of the
world one thouand six hundred years. And the
punishing of the <hi>Amorites</hi> four hundred years.
And so doth put off the rewarding of men till the
world to come. But he tells us, [<hi>That Christ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
kingly power to the Scribes and Pharisees, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they sit in Moses chair.</hi>] But then Christ should
have wronged the Roman Governors, in whom he
acknowledged kingly power, by paying tribute,
and by submitting himself to be judged by them.
Their sitting then in <hi>Moses</hi> chair doeth not imply
kingly power; but their power in expounding
the law of <hi>Moses.</hi> And it is as weak an inference
to say, that Christ is not King of his Church,
[<hi>Because he would not divide the inheritance, between
the two brethren, or because he came to save the world,
not to judge it;</hi>] For dividing of inheritances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
not to Christs spiritual kingdom; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was it the end of Christs comming to judge,
that is to condemn the world, for the Greek
word signifieth both, but to save it; for his name
was Jesus a Saviour, because he came to save his
people from their sins. And no less weak is this
reason: [<hi>The time of Christs preaching is called rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
therefore it is no kingdom.</hi>] Regeneration
is not the time, but the fruit and effect of Christs
preaching: and so far is regeneration from being
inconsistent with Christs Kingdom; that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
tells us in plain tearms; except we be rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
we cannot enter into the Kingdom of God,

a strange wheemsie concerning the
blessed Trinity, in saying, [<hi>That God who hath
been represented (that is personated) thrice, to wit, by</hi>
Moses, <hi>by Christ, and by the Apostles, may properly
enough be said to be three Persons, as represented by
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56808:41"/>
the Apostles, the holy Spirit by which they spake
is God, as represented by Christ, the Son is that God,
as represented by Moses and the high Priests, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is that God. Hence the names of Father, Son,
and Holy Ghost, in the signification of the Godhead,
are never used in the old Testament; for they are Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
that is, they have their names from representing,
which could not be, till divers men had represented
Gods Person,</hi> &amp;c.] Here is strange stuffe: For first,
The word Person in the Trinity, was never taken
by Divines for a Visard, a personating, or repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation,
but for a peculiar way of subsisting;
therefore by the Greek Church the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
was used, till wanton and idle wits began to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
was used answering to the Latine word, <hi>Persona,</hi>
and is defined thus, <gap reason="foreign">

or unbeginning manner of an eternal exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting;
so that in the same essence there is a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
way of subsisting: The Fathers existence is
from himself, the Sons from the Father, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
from both: so in man, there is the soul, the
intellect and will; these three are but one essence,
yet differently subsisting; the soul of it self, the
intellect from the soul, and the wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> from both.
Secondly, if personating, or representing makes
the persons in the Trinity, it will follow, that
there have been and are more then three Pesons,
nay, I may truly say innumerable, for God hath
been represented, not onely by <hi>Moses,</hi> but by <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suah</hi>
also and his successors; by <hi>Aaron</hi> the high
Priest, and all his successors; by all Judges also
and Kings, who are therefore called gods: there
must be then as many persons, as there have been
personatings or representations; and in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
the Trinity may be called a Legion, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56808:41"/>
innumerable persons. Thirdly, Why should
God be called the Holy Spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>, as he was represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Apostles, rather then by being perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
by <hi>Moses,</hi> or by Christ; his reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Apostles spoke by the Spirit: I pray,
did not <hi>Moses</hi> and Christ speak by the same Spirit.
St. <hi>Peter</hi> saith, that the holy men of old spake as
the Spirit moved them. Or why is God by him
called Father, as he was represented by <hi>Moses,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then as he was represented by Christ? Was
there more Paternity in <hi>Moses,</hi> then in any other
man, or in Christ, who by <hi>Isaiah</hi> is called the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting
Father? Or why is he called Father, as
personated by the high Priests. F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Psal.</hi> 89. 26. and <hi>Isa.</hi> 9. he is called the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting

<hi>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee:</hi> And
<hi>Isa.</hi> 9. <hi>For unto us a Son is given.</hi> So the third
Person or Spirit is mentioned; <hi>The Spirit of
God moved upon the Waters, Gen.</hi> 1. Now that this
was no winde, as some have thought, is plain; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
air was created afterwards, and this Spirit

neither is the winde ever called the Spirit

I will pour upon the house of</hi> David <hi>and the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants

But he saith, that these names are not used in the
signification of the God-head, but he is deceived;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56808:42"/>
for when the child Christ is called the everlasting
Father by <hi>Isaiah,</hi> this cannot be in signification
of his humanity; for how can a little child be
an everlasting Father, but in respect of his God-head.</p>
            <p>He saith, (<hi>Cap.</hi> 42.) <hi>[If the Supreme King have
not his regal power in this world, by what authority
can obedience be required to his Officers.</hi>] This is not
to be doubted, but the Supreme King hath his
regal power in this world; for this cause he tells
his Apostles after his resurrection, That all power
was given to him in heaven and in earth; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he sends them abroad into all nations of this
world, teaching them to observe all things which
he had commanded them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. If then he
hath regal power in the world, why should not
his Officers be obeyed. 'Tis true, Christs King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
is not of this world; will it therefore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that it is not in this world? For if in this
world he subdueth the nations to his Scepter by
the sword of his word, if he leads captivity cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
if he giveth gifts unto men, if he prescribe
laws, and punisheth the offendors, shall we not
say he hath Kingly power in this world: if the
Kings and Potentates of the earth, have submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
their scepters to his Heraulds, have received
his yoak, and have placed his cross upon their
crowns in sign of subjection, is he not their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
King, whose dominion here is called the
Kingdom of grace: his other Kingdom in the next
world, shal be the kingdom of glory, which M. <hi>Hobs</hi>
confounds with this of grace: as for the coercive or
commanding power of Ministers which he speaks
against; I must needs confess, there is not so
much, as some could take upon them; yet to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
all coercive power, is to deny the commission
which this great King, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. gave to his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56808:42"/>
that they should compel those in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
to come to his supper. And albeit mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
are called fisher-men, and not hunters; yet
fisher-men use some force in drawing their fish to
the shore: and indeed, none can come to me,
saith Christ, except the Father draw him: as for
his doctrine of dissimulation in matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
both with God and man; I dare not assent
thereto, for God, who is the God of truth, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
truth in the inward parts, he that is not
with him, is against him, who gathereth not with
him scattereth. Linnin and Woolin in the same
garment, different seeds in the same ground, an
ox and an ass at the same plough are not pleasing
to him. <hi>Pulcra est concordia cordis &amp; oris.</hi> If to

I say that excommunication is not a bare denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,

such a punishment as is most grievous; to wit, a

much more grievous is it to be cut off from the

            <p>He denieth (<hi>cap.</hi> 42.) [<hi>that there is any spiritual
Common-wealth among men in this world.</hi>] This he
gronnds upon two reasons; [1. <hi>because it is the same
thing with the Kingdom of Christ, which is not of this
world.</hi> Secondly, <hi>There are no men on earth whose
bodies are spiritual.</hi>] These reasons are very weak:
For first, because a spiritual Common-wealth and
Christs Kingdom are the same, it will follow, that
there is a spiritual Common-wealth amongst men,
which is the Kingdom of grace here, where
Christ raigneth in the hearts of his faithful peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
which though it be not of this world, yet
it is in this world; as I have shewed already:
And of this Kingdom our Saviour speaks, when
he saith, <hi>The Kingdom of God is within you; Luke,</hi>
17. 21 Which consisteth in <hi>righteousness, peace, and
joy in the holy Ghost, Rom.</hi> 14. 17. Secondly, To
say that Christ hath not here a spiritual Common-wealth,
because mens bodies are not spiritual, is
ridiculous; for Christs subjects here are spiritual,
though their bodies be corporeal, because they are
animated, regulated, directed by the spirit. <hi>They
are regenerated by the spirit,</hi> John 3. <hi>They walk not
after the flesh, but after the spirit,</hi> Rom. 8. <hi>The spirit
helpeth their in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Rom. 8. <hi>The holy spirit dwelleth in them,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 14.
<hi>God hath given them of his spirit,</hi> 1 John 4. 13. <hi>They
are sealed with the spirit of promise,</hi> Ephes. 1. 13.
<hi>They have the fruits of the spirit, which are love, joy,
peace, long-suffering,</hi> &amp;c. Gal. 5. 22. Therefore
Christs subjects, though they are here cloathed
with flesh yet are called spiritual: Gal 6. 1. <hi>Yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

there is a dependence, as well as a coherence; in

it was maintained by <hi>Arius</hi> a private person; but
when it was anthorised publickly by the Arian
Princes, it was no more an heresie: and so now,
not <hi>Arius,</hi> but <hi>Athanasius</hi> that opposed it must be
called an heretick, by Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> contrary to the
judgment of all learned men, and the Church of
God hitherto. The great Turk, and the Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans,
who profess at this day the same damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
doctrine of <hi>Arius,</hi> are not hereticks, but the
Christians within his dominions, who are of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
opinion, these are your hereticks Mr. <hi>Hobbs;</hi>
by this your definition, you may call Christ and
his Apostles hereticks, for they held doctrines
contary to the traditions and opinions of the
Scribes and Pharisees, who (as you say) sat in
<hi>Moyses</hi> chair. It is not the person private or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
that makes an heretick, but it is the doctrine,

man may maintain an opinion in Philosophy
contrary to the opinion of the Prince, and yet
no heretick in this, because he holds nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
our Christian faith, his opinion may be
erroneous but not heretical.</p>
            <p>In his three and forty chapter he tels us, [<hi>That
the faith of Christians ever since Christs time, hath
had for foundation, the reputation of Pastors and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of Christian Soveraigns.</hi>] This is to build
our faith upon a sandy foundation, which with
every blast will be overt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rned; the authority
and reputation of men are but arms of flesh, and
broken reeds to rely upon; these may be motives
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56808:47"/>
to induceus to give our assent, as the testimony of
that woman, <hi>John</hi> 4. induced many of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans
of that City to beleeve on Christ? But
the foundation of their faith was Christ himself;
who bestowed that gift upon them, as he doeth
upon us. And how can mans reputation or
authority be the foundation of that which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
all humane reason and capacity; but such
is faith: Besides, faith it self is the ground of our
justification and salvation; for we are both justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and saved by faith; but if man be the ground
of our faith, he must also be the ground of our
j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>stification and saluation; and so Christ died &amp; rose
in vain. But the Apostle sheweth us the true foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of our faith in these words: <hi>For other
foundation can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Jesus Christ,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 11. Christ therefore as he is
revealed to us in his word, is the foundation of
our faith: besides, <hi>By faith we are the sons of God,</hi>
saith the Apostle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. But we were in a bad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
if ourfiliation depended on the authority
of Princes, or reputation of Pastors.</p>
            <p>In his forty fourth chapter<note place="margin">Cap. 44.</note> he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
these words of <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 34. <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub</hi>
the Prince of Devils, that is, [<hi>He hath prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality
over fantasins that appear in the air.</hi>] So that
he makes [<hi>Demons fantasms, or spirits of illusion to
signifie allegorically the same thing.</hi>] But I do not read
that Devils in Scripture are called fantasms, or
fantasms named Devils: when the Disciples, <hi>Mat.</hi>
14. saw Jesus walking on the sea, they thought
they had seen a fantasm; did they mean the devil
by this word? So when Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. was tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
of the devil, is it meant that he was tempted
by a fantasm? Devils are spirits and real sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancet,
and not phantasms or fictions of the brain,
as we shewed be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ore of Angels, I deny not but
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56808:47"/>
Satan may represent to the outward sense, as well
as to the inward or imagination, divers shapes of
things to delude men; which shapes may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
fantasms, as that which <hi>Suidas</hi> calls a diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
fantasm <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; which indeed
was but a deluding shadow or fantasm, and not
the Devil himself; who is an invisible spirit:
therefore although there be in the heathen Poets
fabulous doctrines concerning Demons, we must
not hence infer with Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> [<hi>That Demons are
but idols or fantasms of the brain, without any real
nature of their own, distinct from human fancy.</hi>] For
so he may as wel infer, that God is but a fancy; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Poets have delivered many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Cap. 44. After Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> hath toyled himself
in vain, to prove that Christ hath no kingdom in
this world, at last is content to allow Christ the
kingdom of grace, which is as much as we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire;
for we know that the kingdom of glory is
not yet come; Christ then is King of his Church
militant here, and raigneth in the hearts of his
faithful, and performs all the offices of a King,
even in this world, by prescribing laws, by ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
defending, rewarding, punishing, though
not in so ample a maner, as hereafter; he also
conquereth and subdueth the enemies of his
Church, though not fully till the consummation
of the world: He also enlargeth the territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and bounds of his Kingdom, that he might
fulfil the prophesies, and make good his Fathers
gift. <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. <hi>I have given thee the heathen for thine
inheritance, and the ends of the earth for thy possession.</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:56808:48"/>
This is that kingdom, which is in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
so often called the kingdom of God,
and of heaven; this is that kingdom which in
the resurrection Christ will deliver up to God
his <hi>Father,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>) the souls im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,
for three reasons. [First, <hi>because the
tree of life was to preserve man immortal. Secondly,
what needed Christs sacrifice to recover mans immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
if he hath not lost it: Thirdly, must the wicked
and heathen also enjoy eternal life.</hi>] I answer, The
tree of life was to preserve man immortal, but
not the soul which is immortal by nature, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a spirit, and not subject to corruption, as bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
which are compounded of corruptible mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials,
and of contrary elements. Secondly, Christs
sacrifice was to recover mans immortality, but
not the souls which was not lost; now as a part
cannot be the whole, nor the whole a part; so
neither can the soul <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>be man, nor man the soul.
Thirdly, eternal life which the wicked enjoy, is
a life of misery, and such as they would be willing
to exchange for death, neither is it more strange
that wicked men should enjoy eternal life, then
wicked Angels; both enjoying this immortality,
as a due punishment for their sins: now whereas
he saith, [<hi>That eternal life was not essential to humane
nature, but consequent to the vertue of the tree of life.</hi>]
I grant, that man is not naturally immortal, yet
the soul of man is; but I deny that life eternal
was a consequent to the vertue of any tree; for
no tree can be capable of such a vertue; neither
was the tree of life any other then a Sacrament
of mans immortality, if he had pesevered in his
obedience; therefore God debarred him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of his transgression, from it; in that he
would not have his Sacraments abused by profane
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56808:48"/>
hands. But he tells us, [<hi>That when everlasting
death is called everlasting life in torments, it is a figure
never used but in this very case.</hi>] I answer, That this
figure is used in other cases; as when Christ
saith, <hi>Let the dead go bury the dead;</hi> there natural
life is called death: So when the Apostle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aith,
<hi>We were dead in our sins and trespasses:</hi> he used the
same figure in another case; for there the delight
we have in sin is called death; this figure is used
in the law in another case, for captives, slaves,
prisoners, and such like miserable men, are said
to be civily dead: St. <hi>Paul</hi> in another case useth
this figure, when he saith, <hi>I am crucified;</hi> that is,
dead to the world; to wit, in his affections; and
so they who include themselves in a monastery,
are said to be dead to the world. But he saith,
that this doctrine of the souls imnortality [<hi>is
founded onely on some of the obscurer places of the new
Testament.</hi>] I pray, what obscurity is there in
this place, <hi>Thou shalt be this night with me in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise?</hi>
What was to be with Christ in Paradise, not
the good thiess body, then it must needs be his
soul? So when Christ preached to the spirits in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
what were these spirits? Shaddows onely, or
fancies, such as <hi>Virgil</hi> speaks of: <hi>Umbrae ibant te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues,
simulachraque luce carentum.</hi> Bodies they
could not be, they must needs then be souls: So
when Christ saith, <hi>That body and soul shall be cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
hell fire,</hi> there cannot be meant, as Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>
expounds it, body and life; for then Christ
should speak non-sence, when he saith; <hi>Fear not
them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the
soul, Mat.</hi> 10. 28. That is, fear not them that can take
away the life of the body, but are not able to
take away the life of the life. But he objecteth,
[<hi>That the soul in Scripture is taken sometimes for the
whosle man, or living creature.</hi>] I grant it is so taken
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56808:49"/>
sometimes Synecdochically; will it therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that it is never taken properly? So this word
<hi>flesh</hi> is sometimes tropically used for the whole
man, is therfore never used properly.</p>
            <p>He tells us, (<hi>cap.</hi> 44.) [<hi>That this window gives
entrance to the dark doctrine of eternal torments, of
purgatory, of walking ghosts, and exorcisms.</hi>] The
doctrine of eternal torments is not so dark, as he
takes it; it is in plain termes set down in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
to be an eternal separation from God, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
fire, everlasting shame, and contempt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Neither is it a doctrine either erroneous or dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
that we should for fear of teaching it, deny
the souls immortality; suppose also, that the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of pugatory, walking ghosts and exorcisms
were erroneous, and grounded on the souls im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality;
must we deny this for for fear of these
errors? Must we deny the Scriptures, because
they have been windows to give entrance to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
heresies? What doctrine is so sound, ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox,
and true, which is not abused by wanton,
luxurious and pernitious wits? As for ghost wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
that has no relation to the souls immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
for if by ghost he meant the soul; that wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
usually among the Gentiles, till the body
was buried a hundred years, as <hi>Vrigil</hi> saith: <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
errant annos,</hi> and then it rested in the grave
with the body, as Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> would have it; So
<hi>Virgil</hi> speaks of the soul of <hi>Polidorus,</hi> Aen. 3. <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mamque

upon by <hi>Anaeas</hi> to come to his grave. Again,
this ghost walking was neither of the soul, nor of
the body, but of the shaddow, image, phancy,
or similitude of the body. So <hi>Aen.</hi> 4, <hi>Omnibus um<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

So the shaddow and similitude of <hi>Creusa</hi> appeared

<hi>Hobbs</hi> [<hi>will have to be spoken of Christs transfigura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>]
I know some of the Ancients were of this
opinion; but it is very improbable that Christ
should call a vision, the Kingdom of God; and a
Kingdom with power: therefore it is more likely,
that he meant the kingdom of grace, or of his
Church, which began to spread after his resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
with power, when at the preaching of
fisher-men the world began to submit to the scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Christ: which some that stood there, that
is, the Apostles saw, before they tasted of death:
who are called <hi>some,</hi> in respect of the people, who
also stood there, as may be seen, <hi>Mark</hi> 8. 34. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
whereas Christs kingdom began at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.
Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> demands [<hi>a reason, why
Christians ever since pray, thy kingdom come.</hi>] The
reason is, because that kingdom we pray for, is
not yet come, to wit, the kingdom of Glory;
nor is the kingdom of Grace totally come, or in
its full plenitude, because all nations are not as
yet subdued to Christs Scepter.</p>
            <p>He gives us (<hi>cap.</hi> 44.) a pretty interpretation
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56808:50"/>
of <hi>Solomons</hi> words, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12. 7. <hi>The spirit shall</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to God that gave it, [<hi>That is</hi> (saith he) <hi>God
onely knows (but not man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>) what becomes of mans

somewhat far fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ched: which if it be allowed,
the word of God will prove no better then a nose
of wax. When <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 55. the rulers daughter
being dead, it is said, her spirit returned to her
again; the meaning must be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> according to Mr.
<hi>Hobbs</hi> his interpretation, that her spirit did not
indeed return, but onely she knew (and none
but she) what became of it: So <hi>Zach.</hi> 1. 16. <hi>Thus
saith the Lord, I am returned to</hi> Jerusalem <hi>with mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies:</hi>
The meaning is, that <hi>Jerusalem</hi> onely knew,
what was become of God. Besides, when <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
saith, <hi>The dust shall return to the earth, and the
spirit shall return unto God:</hi> I would know, whether
the dust truely, returns to the earth? if it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns,
why doth not the soul truly return to
God? Seeing with the same breath, the same
phrase is uttered by <hi>Solomon:</hi> as for the question
<hi>Solomon</hi> makes, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 3. 21. <hi>Who knoweth that the
spirit of man goeth upward, and that the spirit of the
beast goeth downward;</hi> doth not sound so in the
Hebrew; but thus: <hi>Who knoweth the spirit of man
that goeth upward:</hi> and so both the French and our
last English translations have it, and so have the
Latin <hi>Geneva</hi> version: The Septuagints read it
thus: <hi>Who hath seen the spirit of man:</hi> and the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva</hi>
translation hath; <hi>who have observed the spirit.</hi>
So that <hi>Solomon</hi> questioneth not the immortality
of the soul, but sheweth the difficulty of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the nature thereof; or the manner how it
leaves the body, and mounteth upward towards
heaven, the place of its original.</p>
            <p>He proves (<hi>cap.</hi> 44.) [<hi>there is no natural immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
of the soul by</hi> Solomon, Eccles. 3. 19. <hi>That
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56808:50"/>
which befalleth the sons of man, befalleth beasts, as
the one dyeth, so dyeth the other, they have all one
breath, and a man hath no preheminence a bove a beast.</hi>]
In these words <hi>Solomon</hi> doth not speak of the soul
at all; but of the body onely, as may bee seen in
the words immediately following. <hi>All go into one
place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.</hi>
I hope the beleeves better of <hi>Solomon,</hi> then to
make him speak so brutishly, as though mans di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
soul were made of dust, and resolved into
dust again: or as if there were no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
mans soul and the breath of beasts. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
then of our animal nature, or corporeal part,
we eat, drink, sleep, breath, and dye like the
beasts, but this concerns nothing at all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
soul of man, by which he is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> specifically
different from beasts. He saith, [<hi>That</hi> Enoch's
<hi>translation makes as much for the immortality of the
body as of the soul.</hi>] I deny it not, and therefore
infer, That if it makes for the immortality of the
body, much more makes it for the immortality of
the soul; therefore this place of <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. 24. <hi>Enoch
walked with God, and he was not; for God took him;</hi> is
alledged by Divines, to prove mans immortality
after the resurrection. Again he saith, [<hi>That this is
a hard saying of</hi> Solomons; <hi>Better is he that hath
not yet been, then they who have been, if the soul be
immortal.</hi>] But I say, that this saying is no waies
hard; for better it is to have no being morally, then
to have a miserable beeing: therefore the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
of a wicked mans soul adds to his unhapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
For this cause Christ saith of <hi>Iudas, That
it had been good for him, if he had never been born.</hi>
Besides, when Christ tels us, <hi>That God is the God
of Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. and therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> was then
alive; Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> saith, [<hi>That Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob were then alive by promise, not actually.</hi>] but I
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56808:51"/>
would fain know when did God make such a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that his soul should live immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally,
and that he should be raised to immortality
in the last day. Again, how can one be said to
live by promise, who is actually dead; How is God
the God of the living, if they whose God he is
be not living, but actually dead; for a dead
man to live by promise is a bull.</p>
            <p>Cap. 44. [<hi>He cannot finde, that any man shall live
in torments everlastingly.</hi>] What doth he say to
that place, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 10. <hi>Where the beast and false
prophet are tormented with the Devil day and night for
ever and ever.</hi> Do not they live in torments ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly,
that live in everlasting shame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt:
but such is the condition of the wicked,
<hi>Dan.</hi> 12 2. <hi>They shall be punished with everlasting
destruction,</hi> or perdition, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 9. But [<hi>it seems
hard to him, that God the Father of mercies should
punish without any end of time,</hi> &amp;c. If God were
not the Father of justice, as well as of mercy, it
would go hard with good men; but <hi>it is just with
God to recompence tribulation to them that trouble you,</hi>
saith the Apostle: <hi>And to you that are troubled, peace
with us,</hi> 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 6, 7. God who is offended is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
the desires of wicked men to sin are eternal,
<hi>Voluissent roprobi sine fine vivere, ut possent sine fine
peccare.</hi> The reward of the godly is eternal;
why then should not the torments of wicked men
be eternal? But I will answer him, as St. <hi>Austin</hi>
answereth the Originists. <hi>Tant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

must heeds be too pernitious, that maketh God
too gratious. Again, to what end did God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
an everlasting fire, if the wicked be not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlastingly
tormented in it? But to this he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers:
[<hi>That there never may want wicked men to
be tormented in them, though not every, nor any one
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56808:51"/>
eternally; for the wicked being left in the estate they
were in after</hi> Adam's <hi>sin, may at the resurrection live
as they did, marry, and give in marriage and engender
perpetually, for there is no place of Scripture to the
contrary.</hi>] When the Scripture speaks of wicked
mens eternal torments, it never speaks of any
redemption thence, and Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> confesseth,
that the Reprobates, who dye in their sins, shall
have no redeemer, they must then remain there
for ever; except they had a Redeemer to help
them ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> thence. Besides, I shewed that the
false prophet is tormented for ever, and we read,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 4. That if any one man shall worship the
beast, the smoke of his torment shall ascend for
evermore. As for leaving the wicked in the estate
they were in after <hi>Adams</hi> fall, is a doctrine well
beseeming the school of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> not of Christ:
it seems also by this doctrine, that at the resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
shall be the revolution of the Platonick
year, when all things shall be acted in this world,
as they were in the beginning: After <hi>Adam's</hi> fall,
men did marry, build, plant, tread, eat, drink,
and solace themselves with divers delights, if the
wicked shall do the same after the resurrection,
they shall be in as good a condition, as the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salmans
in <hi>Mahumets</hi> Paradise, or the Gentiles in
the <hi>Elysian</hi> fields.</p>

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56808:52"/>
with the pleasures of sin; then to endure all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series
and persecution, deny himself, and take
up the cross of Christ, to enjoy unknown happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
which the eye hath not seen, nor the ear
heard of: But when you say that there is no
Scripture contrary to marriage after the resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
I would know whether there be any Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
for it. Why may not <hi>Iudas</hi> Iscariot marry
with some Princes daughter, and by this means
obtain a crown, you can alledge me no Scripture
against it; but I can alledge you Scripture against
marriage; <hi>In the resurrection,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>men nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
marry, nor are given in marriage; but are like
the Angels of God,</hi> that is, without copulation as
they are. Now St. <hi>Matthew</hi> speaks not there of
the resurrection of the just onely, but of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
in general; and so doth St. <hi>Luke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi>
though you would have him speak onely of the
resurrection of just men: for all men shall
rise to life eternal; all men in their celibat shall
be like the Angels: as men shall and may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the children of the resurrection, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
of God: as all men, even the Devils,
are the sons of God by creation: for as he gave
to all men a beeing in the creation, so he will give
to all men a new beeing in the resurrection. To
be brief, that the punishment of wicked men
shall be eternal, is plain by this argument; they
only are pardoned who repent; the wicked after
this life cannot repent, therefore they cannot be
pardoned: besides our Saviour tels us, that <hi>he who
speaketh against the Hol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

there be no remission of sin, there can be no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation
of punishment, for the one depends upon
the other.</p>
            <p>In his 45 Chap. he undertakes to shew, <hi>That those
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56808:52"/>
evil spirits or Devils</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> 
               <hi>Christ cast outof the possessed,
were not such, but diseases.</hi> Sure if this opinion be
true, then Christ did no great matter in curing of
ordinary diseases. But the Scripture tels us, that <hi>He
came to destroy death, and him who hath the power of
death,</hi> which is the Devill, that the prophesie in
Paradise might be fulfilled, <hi>The seed of the woman
shall tread down the Serpents head.</hi> These were
strange diseases that could speak to, &amp; question
Christ, <hi>Art thou come to torment us before our time?</hi>
and could beseech him to have leave to enter into
the Herd of Swine. Our Saviour did not know
so much as Mr. <hi>Hobbs.</hi> that Devils were but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases,
when he gave commission to his Disciples,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 10. and <hi>Luke</hi> 9. not onely to cure diseases,
but also to cast out Devils. And <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.24.
Christ not onely cured divers diseases and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and healed such as were lunatick, and had
the palsie, but those also which were possessed
with Devils; by which we see Diseases and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
are different things. But he saith, <hi>That the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressing
of Christs. command to madness or lunacy, is no
more improper then was his rebuking of the Fever, or
the wind and Sea.</hi> I answer, It's true, Christs spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to those inanimate things, was onely to shew
the power and efficacie of his Word; so in the
Creation God is introduced by <hi>Moses</hi> as if he had
spoken to the creatures; but it were very absurd
to think that diseases should speak and discourse
with Christ; should question and beseech him,
and acknowledge his Divinity, as these Devils
did. But he proceeds and says, <hi>That he hath not
observed out of Scripture, that any man was ever pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
with any other corporeal spirit but that of his own.</hi>
That some men have been possessed with other
spirits besides their own, is plain by many places
of Scripture; but whether these spirits were cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56808:53"/>
or incorporeall, is not the question,
though neither Divinity nor Philosophy doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
any corporeall spirits properly: The
Wind indeed is sometimes called a Spirit, and so is
the Sun, but the word <hi>Spirit</hi> is there used impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
and in a large sense; so are these subtile va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s
in the Nerves and Arteries called Animal
and Vitall Spirits by the Physicians, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they be bodies. Now that Spirits properly
so called<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> such as Angels and Mens souls cannot
be corporeall, is plain, because they have not
quantity, nor are in a place by circumscription,
nor move Physically. Many Angels may be in the
same <hi>ub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> a legion of spirits, that is 6500 may be in
the same man; and yet Mr <hi>Hobbs</hi> cannot observe,
that ever any man hath been possessed with any
other spirit then that of his own. Besides, if Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
were corporeall, their bodies must be either
Homogeniall or Heterogeniall. Not Homogenial;
for different operations, such as are in Angels, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
different organs. Not Heterogenial; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or so
we must make Angels and the souls of men to be
composed of different and contrary entities, and
consequently subject to dissolution and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
All which are grosse absurdities. Again, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
can passe through gresse bodies without pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration
of dimensions, which shew they have not
quantity, and consequently are immateriall: For
the purest body that is cannot passe through ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but the other body must yeeld &amp; give place.
Lastly, if there were not incorporeall spirits, the
world would be imperfect, as being destitute of
Incorporeall substances, which with the corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rcall
make up the Universe, and compleat it.</p>
            <p>He saith (<hi>Chap.</hi> 45) [<hi>That Christ went himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the wilderness, and that this carrying of him up and
down from the wildernesse to the City, and from thence
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56808:53"/>
into a mountain, was a vision.</hi>] I know he went of
himself to be tempted, he being no wayes forced,
but of his own accord undertook to buckle with
Satan our Arch-enemy, that we might the more
boldly enter with him. Yet the Scripture <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aith,
<hi>That he was led by the spirit;</hi> but I cannot admit
that this temtation of Christ was but a vision: for
then we shall have smal comfort by Christs temta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
if it were not reall but imaginary, or in a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
and if we shall admit this to be a vision, we
may suspect the rest of his sufferings to be but vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
to the great dishonor of our Saviour and
his Evangelists who wrot his History, and also to
the discomfort of all Gods children. But how
came Mr <hi>Hobbs</hi> to be so wise as to know this to
be a vision, of which the Evangelists make such an
exact historicall narration? When in Scripture
any thing is done in a dream or vision, the
dream or vision is mentioned; as the Angell ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to <hi>Joseph</hi> in a dream, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. <hi>Peter</hi> saw
a sheet let down from heaven in a vision, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.
The wise men were warned by the Angell in a
dream, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. <hi>Paul</hi> saw the man of <hi>Macedonia</hi>
in a vision, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. The Lord spake to <hi>Paul</hi> in a
vision, <hi>Acts</hi> 18. but in this temtation of Christ
there is no mention of any vision, therefore we
conclude it was reall; and in saying so, we need
not fear that either Christ was possessed, or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away violently by the devill, as Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>
would infer; because our Savviour for our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and salvation, suffered himselfe to be both
tempted and carried by the devill, as afterward
he permitted himself to be apprehended, and
scourged, and crucified by the devils Instruments.
And albeit Satan could not from that high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
shew to the Lord all the kingdomes of the
world, yet he could point to the understanding
their places and situation.</p>

when he stood before him was an incorporeal spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
yet he adjureth or exorciseth him by the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. He tells us, [<hi>That there were
many Demoniacks in the Primitive Church, and few
mad-men; whereas now there are many mad-men, and
few Demoniacks, which proceeds not from the change
of nature, but of names.</hi>] That the use of exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism
hath so prevailed in the Church, should ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister
cause of comfort, not of grief; in that
our Saviour hath not left his Church destitute of
helps and arms against the devil, who takes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
to torment men here, by possessing their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and to torment them hereafter, by insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
into their souls, inticing them to consent to
all kinde of iniquity, that so he may bring them,
with himself, into eternal misery. Now our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
was the chief exorcist himself, for he by his
power and word cast ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> devils, this gift he
bestowed on his Apostles, that they should

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> devils in his name; and therefore the
Disciples after they were sent abroad by Christ,
and had returned, rejoyced that the devils were
subject to them: and this gift of exorcism was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
sometimes on wicked men, as we may see
<hi>Mat.</hi> 7. of those, who in the last day will say
to Christ, <hi>We have cast out devils in thy name.</hi> And
we read <hi>Acts</hi> 19. of the 7. sons of <hi>Scaeva,</hi> who took
upon them to exorcise evil spirits in the name of
the Lord Jesus, because <hi>Paul</hi> had practised exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism
with such good success. We see how the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56808:54"/>
of divination by Paul's command in the name
of Jesus Christ came out of the damosel, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.
Exorcism then is a gift of God, not temporary to
continue onely in the Apostles, but lasting, and
to remain in the Church till the end of the world;
otherwise we should be in a sad condition: if

when he tels us, [<hi>That Demoniacks were many in
the primitive Church, and few mad-men, whereas
now there are many mad-men and few Demoniacks,
which proceed not from the change of nature.</hi> Is not
this to extenuate Christs miracles, who came to
destroy the works of the devil, and to cast out
the prince of this world. And is it not likewise
to make the Evangelists imposters, in publishing
those cures for miraculous which were not, and
calling ordinary and natural diseases by the termes
of devils and evil spirits?</p>
            <p>He will not (<hi>cap.</hi> 45.) have it Satan that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into <hi>Iudas,</hi> though St. <hi>Luke</hi> writes so, [<hi>But
an hostile and trayterous intention of selling Christ, for
as by the holy Ghost are meant frequently graces and
good inclinations, so by entring of Satan may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
wicked cogitations.</hi>] To Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> Satan is
any thing, so he may not be a spirit or incorporeal
substances. Sometimes he is but a fancy, shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
dream, or apparition: sometimes is mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
palsy, lunacy, or any other melady; here
he is a traytorous intention; but indeed there
was more then a trayterous intention that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into <hi>Iudas</hi> at last: the intention to betray
Christ was put into the heart of <hi>Iudas</hi> by Satan,
<hi>John</hi> 13. 2. But when he had received the sop, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
himself entered into him; and as St. <hi>Austin</hi>
on that place saith, took full possession of him,
<hi>John</hi> 13. 27. And though I should yeeld, that
sometimes the holy Ghost is put for the graces of
the spirit, yet it will not follow, that Satan is
used in Scripture for any evil suggestion or inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Again, Satan doth not presently intrude
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56808:55"/>
himself into any man, but first prepares his way
by his Harbingers, that is, suggestions and evil
thoughts, which having made the soul fit for him,
he enters and takes possession, and thus he dealt
with <hi>Iudas:</hi> Again, I would know of Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi>
whether it was Satan in the Serpent, or onely a
treacherous intention, that moved him to speak
and seduce <hi>Eve?</hi> Lastly, why should we take his

            <p>In his forty sixth chapter he spurnes at all lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

such like expressions; which shews how little he
hath of the spirit of humility and modesty: I
finde not too much learning, but too much pride
makes some men mad: true learning is alwaies
joyned with humility; the deepest rivers, saith
<hi>Seneca,</hi> make the least sound; the Cypress tree
is tall but fruitless; the Apple-tree is low but
fruitful; and the more its laden the more it
stoops: that man that slights all but himself, will
be slighted of all but himself; intemperance in
words argue impotency of minde; and as the
Court saith, He is an unjust man that prefers his
own wit to all others. [<hi>Homine imperito nihil quid

dirt in the face of his betters. Every wise man
will employ his eyes at home; will look upon the
wallet that hangs at his own back; will descend
into himself, and then he shall see how small cause
he hath to despise other mens gifts, when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidereth
the defects of his own: [<hi>Tecum babita,
&amp; disces quam sit tibi curta supellex.</hi>] He that thinks
to rear up the imaginary tower of his own fame
upon the ruins of other mens, will finde he
builds upon a sandy foundation, and indeed makes
castles in the air. St. <hi>Austins</hi> counsel is good in
this case; He that will build high, must lay his
foundation low; [<hi>Si vis magnam fabricam constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ere

<hi>Hercules</hi> cannot be pulled down by pigmies;

have intiched us with such monuments of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
which the Universities of the world have

with such applause; and not to require them
with scorn and contempt: this is ingratitude in
the highest degree: I wish therefore that Mr.

less impotency in his expressions against those

[<hi>to cast against them smoak out of his nostrils, as

never be brought in competition with <hi>Aristotle;</hi>
but now let us receive his accusation against <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotles</hi>
Philosophy.</p>
            <p>He saith, (<hi>cap.</hi> 46.) [<hi>That this doctrine of sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
essences will fright men from obeying the laws of
their Country.</hi>] I should think rather that this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
would fright men from disobeying the
laws; for if God commands obedience to the
laws, and subjection to the higher powers, is it
likely that he will permit spirits to walk to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
men from obedience? Or will the spirits of
those holy men, who taught subjection to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
whilst they were alive, teach the contrary
when they are dead? Again, wise men have urged
obedience to their laws, upon the doctrine of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
spirits: so did <hi>Moses</hi> by shewing his laws
came from God, who is a separated essence: so
did <hi>Lyc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

But saith he, [<hi>Upon this ground, faith, wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,

his gifts into them; but indeed the souls immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
is not the ground why God inspireth his
graces, for then he would inspire the most wicked
souls that are with his graces, for they are also
immortal; the ground then of this inspiration is
his own good pleasure, being a free dispenser of
his gifts, neither needs he fear, that we by this
doctrine will make the vertuous and their vertues
to be asunder; for the vertues of vertuous men
are not theirs till they be bestowed. Again, he
saith: [<hi>Who will endeavour to obey the laws, if he
expects obedience to be poured into him.</hi>] I reply, who
will expect obedience to be poured into him, if
he endeavour to obey the law. Again, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is an act of the will; now acts are not infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
but habits. Besides, I answer him with <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas;</hi>
every good man yeelds obedience to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
because he is bound thereto by the law of
nature, where we see inferiour movers obey the
motion of the superiour, and likewise by the
law of God, which teacheth him to be subject to
principalities and powers, and to obey magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
<hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 1. To submit himself <hi>to every ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of man for the Lords sake, whether it be the
King as supreme, or unto Governors, as unto them that
are sent by Him,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13. A good man hath faith
and he knows that faith in Christ includes obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
for Christ himself taught obedience, both
By precept and practise: he is also a just man,
and justice requires that he should give to every
man his due, but obedience is due to superiours;
obedience then needs no inspiration, but such rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
now if any will maintain erroneous opinions,
as he alledgeth upon the doctrine of the souls
immortality, who can help it? Men may build stuble
and hay upon the best foundation, which is Christ
Jesus as the Apostle sheweth. Shall we deny the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56808:57"/>
souls immortality, because of some errors groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
thereon; then by the same reason deny the
Scripture, deny Christ himself.</p>
            <p>He laughs (<hi>cap.</hi> 45.) at the words <hi>circumscriptive</hi>
and <hi>definitive</hi> used in the schooles, which he saith
[<hi>are insignificant words, for the circumscription
of a thing, is nothing else but the defining of its place.</hi>]
Here he sheweth his ignorance in the school
termes; for though circumscribing be the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of a thing, yet the defining or confining is
not the circumscribing thereof; Angels are in a
place or rather space <hi>definitive,</hi> because they are
so confined to one <hi>ubi,</hi> that they cannot at the
same instant be in another, yet without any cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumscription
of parts, to the parts of the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies
in the ambient body or place; for in a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
there are no parts, therefore no circumscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
though there is a confining or definition to
the <hi>ubi:</hi> when we say, that all the soul is in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
part of the body; he asks, [<hi>Whether God is
served with such absurdities.</hi>] He should first prove
this to be an absurdity, and then inform us, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this tenet of the souls indivisibility, be any
part of Gods worship; but indeed it is no more
absurd to say, that the soul is all in every part of
the body; then to say, that the Sun or moon is

all the Sun is in my eye, and all the Sun is in mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions

would have us tell him, [<hi>How an incorporeal sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
is capable of torment and pain in hell fire.</hi>] The

               </gap>ble of pain; if you doubt of this, put your
finger in the fire, and tell me if your soul be not
capable of pain or grief, which is a torment. I
shewed before out of <hi>Austin,</hi> that God hath a way
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56808:58"/>
to torment souls in fire, though unknown to us;
neither can we tell, how the soul goeth hence
without the body into heaven; onely we can tell
him, that when our bodies return to dust, our
souls return to God that gave them, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12. As
for the School-men at which he carps, I deny not
but there are, in some mens opinions, many need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
questions, and subtilties, so there are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
among them many excellent passages, and
useful distinctions; in this life there is no perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;

            <p>He saith, (<hi>cap.</hi> 46.) [<hi>That what is written in the

               </gap>ances
that we might have answered him, but to speak of
things in general, is to say nothing: yet that the
Reader may perceive both the use of Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicks,
and how consonant that knowledge is to
natural reason, I will set down here a few Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physical
maximes. 1. One entity hath but one
specifical essence. 2. The essence receiveth not
augmentation nor diminution. 3. As every
thing desireth to preserve its entity, so it doth
its unity. 4. Unity is before multitude. 5. Truth
is consonant to truth. 6. Every entity is good.
7. Beauty excites affection. 8. Evil is not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petible.
9. Every thing compounded is dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
10. whatsoever is compounded hath parts
and principles. 11. In an universe is contained
all particulars. 12. The whole is greater then
the parts. 13. The first entity is simply infinite.
14. The abstract is before the concret. 15. The
measure is before the thing measured. 16. The
subject is the matter of its accident. 17. The
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56808:58"/>
cause is before the effect. 18. Nothing can be
its own cause. 19. As the essence so the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the effect depends from the cause. 20.
The proximate cause being put, the effect follows.
21. The end moveth the efficient. 22. The end
presupposeth the means. 23. A voluntary cause
is free and indifferent, so is not the natural cause.
24. The matter is capable of forms. 25. The
The form is the cause of distinction and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
26. The generical unity is less then the
specifical, and this then the numerical. 27. I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentity
is founded upon unity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Many more
I could set down, but these are sufficient to let
us see how much Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> is deceived, in
saying, Metaphysick is repugnant to natural rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
            <p>He tells us, (<hi>cap.</hi> 46.) [<hi>That every part of the
universe is body, and that which is not body, is no part
of the universe.</hi>] If he speaks of integral parts, I
grant what he saith; but if he means by parts that
which we call essential; to wit, matter and form,
I deny them to be bodies. His drift is to infer
that souls are bodies, because parts; but I deny
them to be parts, no more then the vital and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
spirits are parts of the arteries and nerves
that contain them; or wine a part of the vessel
that holds it. Spirits are contained in the world,
but are no parts of it. But when he saith, [<hi>That that
which is no part of the universe is nothing, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
no where.</hi>] He will make God to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and no where; for I hope he will not
make him a part of the universe, nor will he make
him corporeal. He carps at <hi>Aristotle</hi> [<hi>for defining
heaviness to be an endeavour to go to the center of the
earth.</hi>] <hi>Aristotle</hi> doth not make this a definition,
but a description of heaviness; for indeed the
essential forms of inanimate things are not easily
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56808:59"/>
to be found by man in this life, in which our best
science is but ignorance; therefore the Phyloso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

differ so much in this very thing, of gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and levity, some holding them to be forms of
the elements, and causes of motion; others hold
them to be passive principles onely of motion,
and that the mover is the generator, which hath

to be substances, others but accidents; but
however the peripateticks have gone as far as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and the light of nature can direct them. God
will not in this world have us to know all things:
our cleerest light here is but a glimmering: but if
this description of <hi>Aristotles</hi> please not Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi>

Phylosophers grant, that in inanimate things,
there is a natural appetite to move towards their

or disposition, which he cannot deny, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
he will deny nature it self: but that stones
can discern as man does, is his own dream, not
the saying of Phylosophers, for they teach the
contrary; to wit, that this natural desire or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
is without all knowledge or discerning:
by this he shews, how little he is acquainted with
their writings.</p>
            <p>Phylosophers tell us, that in condensed matter,
there is less quantity then before, and rarefied
when more. Upon this he asks, (<hi>cap.</hi> 46.) [<hi>If
there can be matter that hath not some determined quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,

I answer no; for the quantity is an inseparable con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

teacheth us, that as any thing shrinks, and
thickneth, it decreaseth in quantity, and so it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth
as it is extended and rarified: He carps
at the souls infusion, at the cause of sense, at the
cause of willing, at occult qualities, and at some
other peripatetick tenets, at which he onely
shews his teeth: not being able to bite them;
save onely that he calls this vain Phylosophy, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming

               </gap>in, for so he should condemn divinity, to which
Phylosophy is subservient: besides, truth cannot
be repugnant to truth; and Phylosophy is one of
Gods special gifts, by which even the Gentiles
were brought to the knowledge of God, and
made inexcusable; there are vain opinions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
some professors of Phylosophy, as there are
among some Divines: must therefore Phylosophy
or Divinity be condemned as vain: he that speaks
against Phylosophy doeth both bewray his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and malice; in disparaging men for making
use of those arms which God hath given us to
fight withall against the enemies of truth; and
to destroy the field of good corn, because the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
man hath sown some tears among them.
To speak against Phylosophy, is to speak against
the light of reason, which God hath kindled in
our mindes.</p>
            <p>But he calls it (<hi>cap.</hi> 42.) [<hi>vain Phylosophy to say
that God is no cause at all of injustice.</hi>] To free God
from injustice, is not vain Phylosophy, but true
Divinity; whereas the opinion of Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> is

the heresie of the Libertines, who made God the
author of sin; or of the Manichees and Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
who held, that God made sin. But I
would know, how can the fountain of justice
be in any sort the cause of injustice: or can he be
the author of sin, that is the punisher of sin; that
makes laws against it, that invites upon promise of
reward all men from it: how can he be free from
hypocrisie, that grieves and is angry for sinful acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
whereof he is the cause himself? How can
he hate injustice, if he be the cause of it; he
must needs love his own work, and consequently
sinful actions? How can God deface his own
work by sin, or his own image in man? How can
it be otherwise but man must delight in sin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
remorse, when he knows that God is any
wise the cause thereof? Therefore to make God
at all the cause of injustice, is in effect to make
him no God. It stands then well with Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
and Divinity also to say, God is not at all the
author of sin; he permits it indeed for his glory,
for the exercise of his servants, and the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the obstinate sinners; but is no more
the cause of it, then the rider is the cause of that
lameness in his horse, which proceeds from his
own unruliness; or the Sun the cause of stinke,
which ariseth of putrifaction. Again, this which
he cals vain Philosophy, is it which brings us to
the knowledge of divine and humane things,
which perfects the will by uniting it to goodness,
and the intellect by uniting it to truth.</p>
            <p>It's ridiculous what he saith of Good and Evil,
to wit, [<hi>That it is not the appetite of privat men, but
the law, which is the will and appetite of the State,
that is the measure of good and evill.</hi>] He makes here
two different appetites, the one of the State,
which is the Law, and the other of private men;
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56808:62"/>
but I say the appetite both of State and privat
men, is one and the same: For if it had not been
the appetite of privat men to have a Law, how
could there have been any? Can a King make a
law by himself without his people which consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of privat men. Again, if not the appetite of
privat men but the law of the State is the measure
of good, what shall we say of <hi>Daniels</hi> privat appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
to worship the God of heaven, and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
law of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> in worshipping his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doll?
Was that law of the Jewish State which
condemned Christ, the measure of good?
Or the Roman law in persecuting the Christians?
But he cannot yet leave barking at <hi>Aristotle,</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
[<hi>That men have learned from his civill Philosophy
to call all manner of Common-wealths but the popular,
tyranny; and all Kings they call tyrants.</hi>] Either he
is very ignorant in <hi>Aristotles Policicks,</hi> or very
malicious: For <hi>Aristotle</hi> both in his <hi>Ethi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ks,
lib.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. and in his <hi>Politicks, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 5.
is so farre from calling Kings tyrants, and all
Commonwealths but the popular tyranny, that he
distinguisheth the Kingly from the Tyrannicall
government, where in plain terms he saith, That
the Kingly is of all governments the best, and the
Tyannicall of all worst, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
that is the worst,
saith <hi>Aristotle,</hi> which is opposite to the best, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
tyranny being <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a trangression from
Kingly government, and opposite to it, must needs
be worst; he shews there that Kings aim at the
publick good, but Tyrants meerly at their own
benefit. A King governs according to the Laws, a
Tyrant dominiers according to his will. Neither
again doth he call all governments but the
popular, tyranny, for he saith, that Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracie
is one of the good governments because it
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56808:63"/>
aims at <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the common utility If
it doth not degenerate into Oligarchy, when a few
of the richer sort will dominier and turn all the
publick good to their own profit: and so he saith
that <hi>Politia,</hi> or popular government is good if it
degenerate not into Democracie, when the poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
sort (whereof there is the greater number) take
upon them to invade the estates of the richer
men, and convert them to their own use. By this
we see how much <hi>Aristotle</hi> is wronged, and how
far he is from calling any lawfull goverment ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,
or Kings Tyrants, whereas he shews that a
Tyrant is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, one that will not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
for his government, but will doe what
he pleaseth be it right or wrong, which is farre
from the practice of Kingly government, which
he compares to the government of a Father over
his children.</p>
            <p>He hath not yet done with <hi>Aristotle,</hi> (<hi>Cap.</hi> 46.)
but accuseth him for saying, That in a well orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Common-wealth not men should govern, but
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he laws, upon this he inferres, [<hi>That every man
who can write and read, finds himself governed by them
he fears and believes can kill or hurt him when he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyeth
not.</hi>] I pray what contradiction is there
here? In a well governed Common-wealth men
should obey the laws; In an ill governed Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
men are forced out of fear to obey
Tyrants. <hi>Aristotle</hi> speakes to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> good not of a bad
government, and sheweth what should be done,
not what is done. Again, <hi>Aristotle</hi> sheweth that
we should rather obey good laws then bad gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,
and good governors rather then bad laws,
<hi>Polit. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 7. so that he will have us obey all, but
withall tells us, that he who obeyeth bad laws, or
bad governors, may be a good subject, but not a
good man. Besides, his reasons are good why we
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56808:63"/>
should rather obey the law then the man, because
the Law is the Rule by which he should govern.
Secondly, because the law is impartiall, and not
subject to affections as men are, whom pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ions do
so carry away, that either they understand not
what is just, or if they do, they follow it not, yet
he denieth n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t but in some cases the man is rather
to be obeyed then the law; to wit, when the
law is ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cure and intricate, or when it is too se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
and rigid. In such cases the governor that
can interpret and mitigate the Law, is to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed.</p>
            <p>What he speaks (<hi>cap.</hi> 46.) against privat spirits,
and forcing of mens consciences, I am not against,
but his quarrell against the School-men for their
barbarous termes, is needlesse and witlesse; for
Philosophers have liberty to use such terms as
may make them intelligible: And it is usuall in
all Arts and professions both Liberall and Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall:

Mathematicians, and you will find it so. For ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
miracles I approve them not; but who can
tell what is fictitious what not, of things done
many hundred years agoe. As for the <hi>Antipodes,</hi>
which some of the Fathers denied, I have in
that poynt cleared them elsewhere; as likwise,
I shewed the vanity of that whimzicall opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the earths motion, at large in that book

Chymera.</hi> If any would have further satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
in that point, let them read what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
there; for I purpose not to boil Coleworts
twice. And whereas Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> saith, <hi>That it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
every day more and more, that years and dayes
are determined by motions of the earth.</hi>] It may be so
in his fancy; but in the judgement of wise men it
appeas lesse and l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sse, and that it is the Sunne,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:56808:64"/>
not the Earth, who like a Giant rejoyceth to run
his course.</p>
            <p>In his 47. chapter he goeth about to overthrow
Christs Kingdom in this world, as being an inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Romanists and Presbyterians to uphold
their own greatn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s. To this purpose he brings
in many controverted doctrines of the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> as the Popes power, succession and infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
the Clergies priviledges, their single life, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricular
confessions, Purgatory, Canonization,
Transubstantiation, &amp;c. which have been ventila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and canvased <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> by many learned
men, and therefore I need not spend more paper
about them. But whatever the benefit or pretence
was which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had by maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Christ had a Kingdom in this world,
Mr <hi>Hobbs</hi> must be forced to acknowledge that
Christ hath a Kingdom here already on earth,
which began after his resurrection, or else he must
deny Gods word: and his own too; for he confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
before that Christs Kingdome here was the
Kingdom of grace. But to say that any, either
<hi>Romanist</hi> or <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> doth hold Christs King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
here to be the Kingdome of glory, as Mr
<hi>Hobs</hi> seemed in the beginning of this chapter to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate,
is to me altogether unknown, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
to him also. For he will find in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
that the kingdom of glory is to be in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
after the generall Resurrection. Again, I
would know how Christs kingdom on earth can
be a Roman invention to uphold their greatnesse,
whereas this doctrine was preached by Christ
himself, by the Apostles and their suceessors, when
they were under persecution, and had no great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to uphold but their greatness in afflictions;
then did they find that they were Kings &amp; Priests
to God, or as St. <hi>Peter</hi> calls them, a <hi>Royall Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</hi>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:56808:64"/>
But by the way I must let him see his error
in saying, [That <hi>Pontifex maximus</hi> was an Officer
subject to the Civill State.] This is not so, but
the Civill State was subject to him, as <hi>Festus</hi> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in these words, <hi>Pontifex maximus Iudex &amp; Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biter
rerum divinarun atque humanarum est.</hi> He is
Judge and Arbitrator both of Divine and Human
things. So <hi>Tully</hi> confirms the same in his oration
he made to the Pontifices for his house. <hi>Majores
nostri vos &amp; religionibus deorum immortalium &amp;
reipublicae summae praeesse voluerunt.</hi> They had, saith he,
not only the chief charge of Religion, but also of
the State. And shortly after, <hi>Omnis Reipub. digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas,
omnium salus, vita, l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>bertas, arae, foci, Dii penates,
bona fortunae, domicilia, vestrae sapientiae, fidei, potestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
commissa &amp; credita esse videntur.</hi> To their trust &amp;
power was committed not only Religion, but also
all things that concerned the Common-wealth.
So <hi>Dionysius, lib.</hi> 2. shewech that those Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
were <hi>nullius potestati obnoxii,</hi> subject to no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
nor were they to give an account of their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
either to the Senat or the People. They had
the same honours which they were wont to give
to their Kings, and more, for no man had
the honor to be carried in a Chariot to the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll,
but onely the Pontifex; therefore this office
and honor was so great, that <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>a</hi> himself would
be <hi>Pontifex,</hi> and so were divers Consuls. <hi>Iulius
Caesar,</hi> and the Emperours after him, discharged
that Office themselves, as holding it unfit that it
should be subject to any Civill power, but that it
should be incorporated in the supreme civil office.</p>
            <p>Lastly he tells us (<hi>Chap.</hi> 47.) [<hi>That Aristotles
Metaphysicks, Ethicks, and Politicks, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </hi>]
But in this he is as much deceived, as in his
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56808:65"/>
other Tenets; for next to the Scripture, <hi>Aristotles</hi>
Phylosophy and School Divinity have been the

errors of our Adversaries which he hath mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
Our Modern Divines have made great use of
these in handling their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>troversies, as may be seen
easily by those that read them. As for School Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
which he so much slights; because, it seems,

out his light; <hi>de te fabula narretur,</hi> I think Mr.
<hi>Hobbs</hi> hath the like conceit of his <hi>Leviathan,</hi> that
it shall be dispersed over all the world, and shall
extinguish <hi>Aristotle</hi> the light of learning: But I
think the Fable of one <hi>Elias</hi> a Jew will be fitter
for him, he writes that <hi>Leviathan</hi> is a great Fish,
laid up long since in Pickle, to be food for the just
in the kingdom of the Messia here on earth.
Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> expecteth such a kingdom, therefore I
think he cannot imploy his <hi>Leviathan</hi> better then
to salt it against that day, that he with the other
subjects of that imaginary kingdom may feast and
make good cheer therewith. But in good earnest

               <item>Things future have a being. Prophesie is
not guessing. No absurdity to say the soul is all in all,
and all in every part. To be born, no act of the

               <item>Covenants are not bare words, nor do all

be injurious to their subjects. Men indy injure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Injury, Iniquity and Injustice the same

               <label>Chap. 20.</label>
               <item>Kings and Tyrants different, how. <hi>Samuel</hi>

a Monarchy and Democracy. <hi>Aristotles</hi> reason,
why under Democracy, there is more liberty, then

               <item>Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> contradicts himself, concerning
the power which Subjects give to their Soveraigns.
Pride is no cause of submission to government, but
of Rebellion rather.</item>
               <label>Chap. 49.</label>
               <item>The danger of acting against conscience is
no presumption, but a duty to judge of good and evil.
Faith is not attained by reason and study, but by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
<pb facs="tcp:56808:69"/>
and inspiration. Faith is a miracle. An
account may be given of inspired faith. Prophesie
and Faith not the same. Faith may stand with ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
obedience. Princes are subject to their own laws.
How every private man hath a property in his good.</item>
               <label>Chap. 31.</label>
               <item>The subjects of hope, love, and fear often
confounded. God is not a name of relation. Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
reason, and the word of God different. Reason
must be subject to faith. Our natural reason cannot
purchase justice, peace, and religion. Natural reason
is sometimes contrary to Gods word. Divine dreams
are of force to win belief.</item>
               <label>Chap. 33.</label>
               <item>How <hi>Moses's</hi> words are to be understood,

               <label>Chap. 34.</label>
               <item>Spirits are real parts of the universe,
though not corporeal. Why substances are so called,
The spirit that moved on the waters was not a
winde. The word Ghost, what it signifieth. Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
bodies not visible delusions, may be seen by many
at once. How spirits are in a place. Angels are
not fancies or dreams. Why called gods. Why they
appeared in mans shape. The Dove and fiery tongues
were not Angels. Why Angels are distinguished by
names. How evil Angels suffer by fire. How we
shall be like the Angels in the resurrection. Faith
excludes reason.</item>
               <label>Chap. 31.</label>
               <item>Divers places of Scripture mis-alleadged
by Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> for his earthly kingdom, and refuted.
What <hi>Holam</hi> is, and Paradise, and the new <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.</hi>
There is reason and authority to prove our
happiness in heaven. Divers places of Scripture
expounded to this purpose, and Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> his
texts brought to the contrary, refuted. The souls
immortality proved by Scripture.</item>
               <label>Chap. 38.</label>
               <item>Christ proves as well the souls immortality,
as the resurrection of the body to the Saduces. The
<pb facs="tcp:56808:70"/>
souls immortality proved by Scripoure. A place in
<hi>Job</hi> explained. The opinion of Christs earthly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and the souls sleep are old heresies. Hell is in
the lower parts of the earth. How the Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
speeches concerning Christs Kingdom are to be
understood. We shall ascend higher then Gods
foot-stool.</item>
               <label>Chap 41.</label>
               <item>Christ hath not been all this while since
his resurrection without a Kingdom. Differring of
punishments and rewards here, no argument that
Christ hath no Kingdom. What it is to sit in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses's</hi>
chair. Other places of Scripture expounded.</item>
               <label>Chap. 42.</label>
               <item>The blessed Trinity vindicated, and proved out of the old Testament. Christs Kingdom is in
this world, though not of this world. Dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in religion condemned. The Apostles made laws,
and had power to command. Disobedience a great
sin. Minister and servant the same thing Princes
why shepherds; their baptism doth not authorise them
to preach. <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not to <hi>Moses.</hi> The Romans had the legislative po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
over the Iews. Excommunication a punishment.
Christs Kingdom is spiritual, though the subjects are
cloathed with flesh. In Common-wealths there is
a dependance, as well as a coherence. Heresie, what
it is, and who be Hereticks.</item>
               <label>Chap. 45.</label>
               <item>Our faith depends not upon mans reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and authority.</item>
               <label>Chap. 44.</label>
               <item>Devils and Fantasims, or Idols are not the
same. Christs Kingdom here is the Kingdom of
Grace. The soul how immortal. The wicked live
eternally. The tree of life. Life sometimes called
death. The soul how taken in Scripture. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is plain for the souls immortality. Ghost-walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what it is. Eternal torments no dark doctrine.
Christs Transfiguration was not the Kingdom of God.
<hi>Solomons</hi> words <hi>Eccles. 12. 7.</hi> and <hi>Eccles. 3. 21.</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:56808:70"/>
concerning the soul, expounded. And <hi>Eccles. 3. 19.
Enoch's</hi> translation. Better be dead, then live in
misery. <hi>Abraham's</hi> soul is alive actually. That
the torments of the wicked are eternal, proved. Man
shall not be in the same condition after the resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that <hi>Adam</hi> was after his fall.</item>
               <label>Chap. 45.</label>
               <item>Devils which Christ cast out were not disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
Angels and Mens souls are not corporeal spirits.
Christs temptation in the desart was real, and no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
Exorcisms useful in the Church how. Many
possessed in these latter times. It was Satan, and not a
treacherous intention that entered into <hi>Judas.</hi>

               <label>Chap. 46.</label>
               <item>Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> taxed for his exorbitant speeches
against <hi>Aristotle</hi> and the other Phylosophers. Men
are not frighted from obedience by separated essences.
Graces are inspired or poured into us. Inspiration

<hi>Aristotle</hi> vindicated from calling kingly, or any
