            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

VINDICATION
OF THE
REASONABLENESS
OF Christianity, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>MY Book had not been long
out, before it fell under the
Correction of the Author of
a Treatise, Entituled, <hi>Some Thoughts
concerning the several Causes and Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of Atheism, especially in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Age.</hi> No contemptible Adversary
I'le assure you; since, as it seems, he
has got the Faculty to heigthen every
thing that displeases him into the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
Crime of Atheism; And breaths
against those who come in his way a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50134:4"/>
Pestilential Air, whereby every the
least Distemper is turned into the
Plague, and becomes Mortal. For who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
does not just say after Mr. <hi>Ed's.</hi>
cannot 'tis evident escape being an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theist,
or a promoter of Atheism. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but approve of any ones Zeal to
Guard and Secure that great and Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Article of all Religion and Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
That there is a God: But Atheism
being a Crime, which for its Madness as
well as Guilt, ought to shut a Man out
of all Sober and Civil Society, should
be very warily charged on any one by
deductions and Consequences which he
himself does not own, or at least do
not manifestly and unavoidably flow
from what he asserts. This Caution,
Charity, I think, obliges us to: And
our Author would possibly think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
hardly dealt with, if, for neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some of those Rules he himself
gives, <hi>p.</hi> 31. &amp; 34. against Atheism, he
should be pronounced a promoter of
it: As rational a Charge, I imagine, as
some of those he makes; And as fitly
put together, as <hi>the Treatise of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness
of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. brought in
among the causes of Atheism. However
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50134:4"/>
I shall not much complain of him, since
he joyns me, <hi>p.</hi> 104. with no worse
Company than two Eminently Pious
and Learned<note n="*" place="margin">Bp. <hi>Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,</hi> and the Author of <hi>The Naked Truth.</hi>
               </note> Prelates of our Church,
whom he makes favourers of the same
<hi>Conceit,</hi> as he calls it. But what has
that <hi>Conceit</hi> to do with Atheism? Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much. That <hi>Conceit</hi> is of Kin to
<hi>Socinianism,</hi> and <hi>Socinianism</hi> to <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism.</hi>
Let us hear Mr. <hi>Ed's.</hi> himself. He
says, <hi>p.</hi> 113. I am <hi>all over Socinianized:</hi>
and therefore my Book fit to be placed
among the Causes of Atheism. For in
the 64. and following Pages, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to shew, That <hi>a Socinian is an
Atheist, or lest that should seem harsh, one
that favours the Cause of Atheism, p.</hi> 75.
For so he has been pleased to mollifie,
now it is published as a Treatise, what
was much more harsh, and much more
confident in it, when it was Preached
as a Sermon. In this abatement he
seems a little to comply with his own
Advice against his fourth Cause of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism;
which we have in these words,
<hi>pag. 34. Wherefore that we may effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
prevent this folly in our selves, let
us banish Presumption, Confidence, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50134:5"/>
Self-conceit; let us extirpate all Pride
and Arrogance: Let us not List our
selves in the Number of Caprioious
Opiniators.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall leave the <hi>Socinians</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to answer his Charge against
them, and shall Examine his Proof of
my being a <hi>Socinian.</hi> It stands thus,
<hi>pag. 112. When <unclear>he</unclear>
               </hi> [the Author of the
Reasonableness of Christianity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>]
<hi>proceeds to mention the Advantages and
Benefits of Christ's coming into the World,
and appearing in the Flesh, he hath not
one Syllable of his satisfying for us, or
by his Death purchasing Life or Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or any thing that sounds like it.
This and several other things shew that
he is all over Socinianized.</hi> Which in
effect is, that because I have not set
down all that this Author perhaps
would have done, therefore I am a <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian.</hi>
But what if I should say, I set
down as much as my Argument re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
and yet am no <hi>Socinian?</hi> Would
he from my silence and omission give
me the Lye, and say, I am one? Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mizes
that may be over-turned by a
single denial, are poor Arguments, and
such as some Men would be ashamed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50134:5"/>
of: At least, if they are to be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Men of this Gentleman's Skill
and Zeal, who knows how to make a
good use of Conjectures, Suspicions,
and Uncharitable Censures in the Cause
of God; yet even there too (if the
Cause of God can need such Arts)
they require a good Memory to keep
them from recoiling upon the Author.
He might have taken notice of these
words in my Book, <hi>pag.</hi> 107. <q>From
this estate of Death Jesus CHRIST
RESTORES all Mankind to Life.</q>
And a little lower, <q>The Life which
Jesus Christ restores to all Men.</q> And
<hi>p.</hi> 205. <q>He that hath incurred Death
for his own Transgression, cannot
LAY DOWN HIS LIFE FOR
ANOTHER, as our Saviour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses
he did.</q> This methinks SOUNDS
SOMETHING: LIKE <hi>Christ's
purchasing Life for us by his Death.</hi> But
this Reverend Gentleman has an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
ready; It was not in the place he
would have had it in: It was not
where I <hi>mention</hi> the Advantages and
Benefits of Christ's coming. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I not having one Syllable of
Christ's Purchasing Life and Salvation
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50134:6"/>
for us by his Death, or any thing that
sounds like it; this, and several other
things that might be offered, shew
that I am <hi>all over Socinianized.</hi> A very
clear and ingenuous Proof, and let him
enjoy it.</p>
            <p>But what will become of me, that I
have not mentioned <hi>Satisfaction!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Possibly this Reverend Gentleman
would have had Charity enough for a
known Writer of the Brotherhood, to
have found it by an <hi>Inuendo</hi> in those
words above quoted, of laying down
his Life for another. But every thing
is to be strained here the other way.
For the Author of the <hi>Reasonableness of
Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. is of necessity to
be represented as a <hi>Socinian;</hi> or else
his Book may be read, and the Truths
in it, which Mr. <hi>Ed's.</hi> likes not,
be received, and People put upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining.
Thus one, as full of Happy
Conjectures and Suspicions as this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
might be apt to Argue. But
what if the Author designed his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,
as the Title shews, chiefly for
those who were not yet throughly or
firmly Christians; proposing to work
on those who either wholly disbelieved
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50134:6"/>
or doubted of the truth of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion? Would any one blame
his Prudence, if he mentioned only
those Advantages which all Christians
are agreed in? Might he not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and observe that Command of the
Apostle, <hi>Rom. 14. 1. Him that is weak
in the Faith receive ye, but not to doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
disputations,</hi> without being a <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian?</hi>
Did he amiss, that he offered to
the belief of those who stood off, that,
and only that which our Saviour and
his Apostles preached for the reducing
the unconverted World? And would any
one think he in earnest went about
to perswade Men to be Christians, who
should use that as an Argument to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
the Gospel, which he has
observed Men to lay hold on as an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
against it? To urge such Points
of Controversie as necessary Articles
of Faith, when we see our Saviour and
the Apostles in their Preaching urged
them not as necessary to be believed,
to make Men Christians, is (by our
own Authority) to add Prejudices to Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices,
and to block up our own way
to those Men whom we would have
access to, and prevail upon. But some
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50134:7"/>
Men had rather you should write
Booty, and cross your own design of
removing mens Prejudices to Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
than leave out one tittle of what
they put into their Systems. To such
I say; Convince but Men of the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Jesus Christ; make them but
see the Truth, Simplicity, and Reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableness
of what he himself Taught,
and required to be believed by his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers;
and you need not doubt, but,
being once fully perswaded of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and the Advantages which all
Christians agree are received by him,
such Converts will not lay by the
Scriptures; but by a constant Reading
and Study of them, get all the Light
they can from this Divine Revelation;
and nourish themselves up in the words
of Faith, and of good Doctrin, as St.
<hi>Paul</hi> speaks to <hi>Timothy.</hi> But some Men
will not bear it, that any one should
speak of Religion, but according to
the Model that they themselves have
made of it. Nay, though he proposes
it upon the very Terms, and in the
very Words which our Saviour and
his Apostles preached it in, yet he shall
not escape Censures, and the severest
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50134:7"/>
Insinuations. To deviate in the least,
or to omit any thing contained in their
Articles, is Heresie under the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidious
Names in fashion, and 'tis well if
he escapes being a down-right Atheist.
Whether this be the way for Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to make themselves hearkened to,
as Men in earnest in Religion, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
concerned for the Salvation of
mens Souls, I leave them to consider.
What success it has had towards per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading
Men of the Truth of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
their own Complaints of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency
of Atheism on the one hand,
and the Number of Deists on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
sufficiently shew.</p>
            <p>Another thing laid to my Charge,
<hi>p.</hi> 105. &amp; 107. is my <hi>forgetting, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wilful omitting some plain and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
Passages,</hi> and some <hi>Famous Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies
in the Evangelists;</hi> namely,
<hi>Mat. 28. 19. Go teach all Nations, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
them in the Name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</hi> And
<hi>Iohn 1. 1. In the beginning was the
Word, and the Word was with God, and
the Word was God.</hi> And verse 14. <hi>And
the Word was made Flesh.</hi> Mine it seems
in this Book, are all sins of Omission.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50134:8"/>
And yet when it came out, the buz, and
flutter, and noise which was made, and
the Reports which were raised, would
have perswaded the World that it sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
all Morality, and was designed
against the Christian Religion. I must
confess Discourses of this kind, which I
met with spread up and down, at first
amazed me; knowing the sincerity of
those Thoughts which perswaded me
to publish it, (not without some hope
of doing some Service to decaying
Piety, and mistaken and slandered
Christianity.) I satisfied my self a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
those Heats with this assurance,
that if there was any thing in my
Book, against what any one called Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
it was not against the Religion
contained in the Gospel. And for that
I appeal to all Mankind.</p>
            <p>But to return to Mr. <hi>Ed's</hi> in
particular, I must take leave to tell
him, that if omitting <hi>plain and obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Passages, and famous Testimonies in
the Evangelists,</hi> be a fault in me, I
wonder why he, among so many of
this kind that I am guilty of, mentions
so few. For I must acknowledge I have
omitted more, nay, many more, that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50134:8"/>
are <hi>plain and obvious Passages, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Testimonies in the Evangelists,</hi>
than those he takes notice of. But if
I have left out none of those <hi>Passages
or Testimonies</hi> which contain what our
Saviour and his Apostles preached, and
required assent to, to make men Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
I shall think my Omissions (let
them be what they will) no faults in
the present case. What ever Doctrines
Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> would have to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
if they are such as our Saviour
and his Apostles required to be believed
to make a Man a Christian, he will be
sure to find them in those Preachings
and <hi>Famous Testimonies</hi> of our Saviour
and his Apostles that I have quoted.
And if they are not there, he may rest
satisfied, that they were not proposed by
our Saviour and his Apostles, as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to be believed, to make Men
Christ's Disciples.</p>
            <p>If the Omission of other Texts in
the Evangelists (which are all true al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
and no one of them to be disbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved)
be a fault, it might have been
expected that Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> should have
accused me for leaving out <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. 18.
to 23. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 24. 35. 50. 60.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50134:9"/>
for these are <hi>plain and obvious Passages,
and famous Testimonies in the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists;</hi>
and such whereon these Articles
of the Apostles Creed, <hi>viz. Born of the
Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>suffered under</hi> Pontius
Pilate, <hi>was crucified, dead, and buried,</hi>
are founded. These being Articles of
the Apostles Creed, are look'd upon as
<hi>Fundamental Doctrines:</hi> And one would
wonder why Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> so quietly
passes by their Omission; did it not
appear that he was so intent on fixing
his Imputation of <hi>Socinianism</hi> upon me,
that rather than miss that, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to drop the other Articles of his
Creed. For I must observe to him,
that if he had blamed me for the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of the places last quoted out
of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> (as he had as much
reason as for any other) it would
planily have appeared how idle and
ill-grounded his charging <hi>Socinianism</hi>
on me was. But at any rate he was to
give the Book an ill Name. Not because
it was <hi>Socinian.</hi> For he has no more
reason to charge it with <hi>Socinianism</hi>
for the Omissions he mentions, than the
Apostles Creed. 'Tis therefore well
for the Compilers of that Creed, that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50134:9"/>
they lived not in Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s days:
For he would no doubt have found them
<hi>all over Socinianized,</hi> for omitting the
Texts he quotes, and the Doctrines he
collects out of <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. &amp; <hi>Ioh. 14. p.</hi> 107,
108. <hi>Socinianism</hi> then is not the fault
of the Book, whatever else it be. For
I repeat it again, there is not one word
of <hi>Socinianism</hi> in it. I that am not so
good at Conjectures as Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi>
shall leave it to him to say; or to those
who can bear the plainness and simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of the Gospel, to guess, what its
fault is.</p>
            <p>Some Men are shrewd guessers, and
others would be thought to be so: But
he must be carried far by his forward
Inclination, who does not take notice,
that the World is apt to think him a
Diviner, for any thing rather than for
the sake of Truth, who sets up his own
Suspicions against the direct Evidence
of things; and pretends to know
other mens Thoughts and Reasons bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than they themselves. I had said,
that the Epistles being writ to those
who were already Believers, could not
be supposed to be writ to them to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50134:10"/>
teach them Fundamentals, without
which they could not be Believers.</p>
            <p>And the Reason I gave why I had
not gone through the Writings in the
Epistles, to Collect the Fundamental
Articles of Faith, as I had through the
Preachings of our Saviour and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
was, Because those Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Articles were in those Epistles pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuously,
and without distinction,
mixed with other Truths. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we shall find and discern those
great and necessary Points best in the
Preachings, of our Saviour and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
to those who were yet igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the Faith, and unconverted.
This, as far as I know my own thoughts,
was the reason why I did (as Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>
complains, <hi>p.</hi> 109.) <hi>not proceed
to the Epistles, and not give an Account
of them, as I had done of the Gospels
and Acts.</hi> This I imagined I had in
the close of my Book so fully and
clearly expressed, particularly <hi>p.</hi> 125.
that I supposed no body, how willing
soever, could have mistaken me. But
this Gentleman is so much better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with me than I am with my
self; sees so deeply into my Heart, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50134:10"/>
knows so perfectly every thing that
passes there; that he with assurance tells
the World, <hi>p. 109. That I purposely
omitted the Epistolary Writings of the
Apostles, because they are fraught with
other Fundamental Doctrines beside
that one which I mention.</hi> And then he
goes on to enumerate those Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Articles, p. 110, 111. viz. <hi>The
Corruption and Degeneracy of Humane
Nature, with the true Original of it
(the Defection of our first Parents) the
Propagation of Sin and Mortality, our
Restoration and Reconciliation by Christ's
Blood, the Eminency and Excellency
of his Priesthood, the Efficacy of his
Death, the full Satisfaction made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to Divine Iustice, and his being made
an All sufficient Sacrifice for Sin. Christ's
Righteousness, our Iustification by it,
Election, Adoption, Sanctification, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Faith, The Nature of the Gospel,
The New Covenant, The Riches of God's
Mercy in the way of Salvation by Iesus
Christ, The certainty of the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Humane Bodies, and of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Give me leave now to ask you se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
whether these, which you
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50134:11"/>
have here set down under the Title
of <hi>Fundamental Doctrines,</hi> are such
(when reduced to Propositions) that
every one of them is required to
be believed to make a Man a Christian,
and such, as without the actual belief
thereof, he cannot be saved. If they
are not so every one of them, you
may call them <hi>Fundamental Doctrines</hi>
as much as you please, they are not
of those Doctrines of Faith I was speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of, which are only such as are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to be actually believed to make
a Man a Christian. If you say, some
of them are such necessary Points of
Faith, and others not, you by this spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
List of well-sounding, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>explained
terms arbitrarily collected,
only make good what I have said, <hi>viz.</hi>
That the necessary Articles of Faith
are in the Epistles promiscuously deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with other Truths, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they cannot be distinguished but
by some other mark than being barely
found in the Epistles. If you say, that
they are all of them necessary Articles
of Faith, I shall then desire you to
reduce them to so many plain Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
and then prove them to be
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50134:11"/>
every one of them required to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
by every Christian Man to make
him a Member of the Christian Church.
For to begin with the first, 'tis not
enough to tell us, as you do, that <hi>the
Corruption and Degeneracy of Humane
Nature, with the true Original of it,
(the Defection of our first Parents)
the Propagation of Sin and Mortality,
is one of the great Heads of Christian
Divinity.</hi> But you are to tell us
what are the Propositions we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to believe concerning this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
For nothing can be an Article of
Faith, but some Proposition; and then
it will remain to be proved, that these
Articles are necessary to be believed
to Salvation. The Apostles Creed was
taken, in the first Ages of the Church,
to contain all things necessary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
I mean, necessary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved:
But you have now better
thought on it, and are pleased to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
it, and we, no doubt, are bound
to submit to your Orthodoxy.</p>
            <p>The List of Materials for his Creed (for
the Articles are not yet formed) Mr.
<hi>Ed's.</hi> closes, <hi>p.</hi> 111. with these words:
<hi>These are the Matters of Faith contained
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50134:12"/>
in the Epistles, and they are Essential
and Integral parts of the Gospel it self.</hi>
What, just these? Neither more nor
less? If you are sure of it, pray let
us have them speedily, for the Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling
of Differences in the Christian
Church, which has been so cruelly
torn about the Articles of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Faith, to the great Reproach of
Christian Charity, and Scandal of our
true Religion.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Ed's.</hi> having thus, with two learned
Terms <hi>of Essential and Integral</hi> Parts,
sufficiently proved the Matter in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
<hi>viz.</hi> That all those, he has set
down, are Articles of Faith necessary
to be believed to make a Man a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
he grows warm at my omission
of them. This I cannot complain of
as unnatural: The Spirit of Creed-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
always arising from an heat of
Zeal for our own Opinions, and warm
Endeavours, by all ways possible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry
and bear down those who differ
in a tittle from us. What then could
I expect more gentle and candid, than
what Mr. <hi>Ed's.</hi> has subjoyned in these
words? <hi>And therefore it is no wonder,
that our Author, being sensible of this
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50134:12"/>
(viz.</hi> That the Points he has named were
<hi>Essential and Integral parts of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel)
would not vouchsafe to give us an
Abstract of those inspired Writings [the
Epistles] but passes them by with some
Contempt.</hi> Sir, when your Angry Fit
is over, and the abatement of your
Passion has given way to the return of
your Sincerity, I shall beg you to read
this passage in 297 <hi>pag.</hi> of my Book.
<q>These Holy Writers (<hi>viz.</hi> the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of the Scriptures) INSPIRED
from above, writ nothing but Truth,
and in most places very weighty
Truths to us now, for the expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
clearing, and confirming of the
Christian Doctrine; and establishing
those in it who had embraced it.</q> And
again, <hi>pag.</hi> 299. <q>The other parts of
DIVINE REVELATION are
Objects of Faith, and are so to be
received. They are Truths, of which
none that is once known to be such,
<hi>i. e.</hi> revealed, may or ought to be
disbelieved.</q> And if this does not
satisfie you that I have as high a Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
for the Epistles, as you or any
one can have, I require you to publish
to the World those passages which
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50134:13"/>
shew my <hi>Contempt</hi> of them. In the
mean time I shall desire my Reader to
examine what I have writ concerning
the Epistles, which is all contained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>p.</hi> 290 and 301 of my Book; And
then to Judge, whether I have made bold
with the Epistles in what I have said of
them, or this Gentleman made bold
with Truth in what he has writ of me.
Humane Frailty will not, I see, easily
quit its hold; What it loses in one part,
it will be ready to regain in another;
and not be hindred from taking Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizals,
even on the most Priviledged
sort of Men. Mr. <hi>Ed's.</hi> who is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched
in Orthodoxy, and so is as
safe in Matters of Faith almost as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
it self, is yet as apt to Err as
others in Matter of Fact.</p>
            <p>But he has not yet done with me
about the Epistles: All his fine Draught
of my slighting that part of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
will be lost, unless the last strokes
compleat it into <hi>Socinianism.</hi> In his
following words you have the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the whole Matter. His words
are these. <hi>And more especially, if I
may Conjecture,</hi> (by all means, Sir;
Conjecturing is your proper Talent;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50134:13"/>
you have hitherto done nothing else;
And I will say that for you, you have
a lucky Hand at it.) <hi>He doth this, (i. e.
pass by the Epistles with Contempt)
because he knew that there are so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and frequent, and those so illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and eminent Attestations to the
Doctrine of the ever to be adored
Trinity, in these Epistles.</hi> Truly, Sir,
if you will permit me to know what
I know, as well as you do allow your
self to conjecture what you please,
you are out for this once. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why I went not through the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
as I did the Gospels and the <hi>Acts,</hi>
was that very Reason I printed, and
that will be found so sufficient a one
to all considerate Readers, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
they will think you need not
strain your Conjectures for another.
And if you think it be so easie to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
Fundamentals from not Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals
in the Epistles, I desire you
to try your Skill again, in giving the
World a perfect Collection of Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
out of the Epistles, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
all that is required, and no more
than what is absolutely required to be
believed by all Christians, without
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50134:14"/>
which Faith they cannot be of Christ's
Church. For I tell you, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the shew you have made, you have
not yet done it, nor will you affirm
that you have.</p>
            <p>His next Page, <hi>viz.</hi> 112. is made
up of the same, which he calls,
Not Uncharitable Conjectures. <hi>I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound,</hi>
he says, <hi>Iohn 14. 9. &amp;c. after
the Antitrinitarian Mode:</hi> And I
make Christ <hi>and Adam to be Sons of
God, in the same sense, and by their
Birth, as the Racovians generally do.</hi> I
know not but it may be true, that the
<hi>Antitrinitarians and Racovians</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
those places as I do: But 'tis
more than I know that they do so. I
took not my sense of those Texts from
those Writers, but from the Scripture
it self, giving Light to it's own mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
by one place compared with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
What in this way appears to me
its true meaning, I shall not decline,
because I am told, that it is so under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by the <hi>Racovians,</hi> whom I never
yet read; nor embrace the contrary,
though <hi>the generality of Divines</hi> I more
converse with, should declare for it.
If the sense wherein I understand those
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50134:14"/>
Texts be a mistake, I shall be behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to you if you will set me right.
But they are not Popular Authorities,
or Frightful Names, whereby I judge
of Truth or Falshood. You will now
no doubt applaud your Conjectures;
The Point is gained, and I am openly
a <hi>Socinian,</hi> since I will not disown that
I think the <hi>Son of God</hi> was a Phrase
that among the <hi>Iews</hi> in our Saviour's
time was used for the <hi>Messiah,</hi> though
the <hi>Socinians</hi> understand it in the same
sense; And therefore I must certainly
be of their Perswasion in every thing
else. I admire the acuteness, force,
and fairness of your Reasoning, and so
I leave you to Triumph in your <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures.</hi>
Only I must desire you to
take notice, that that Ornament of
our Church, and every way Eminent
Prelate, the late Arch-Bishop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi>
understood that Phrase in the
same sense that I do, without being a
<hi>Socinian.</hi> You may read what he says
concerning <hi>Nathanael,</hi> in his first
<hi>Serm. of Sincerity,</hi> published this year.
His words are these, <hi>p. 4. And being
satisfied that he</hi> [our Saviour] <hi>was the
Messiah, he presently owned him for such,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50134:15"/>
calling him the SON OF GOD, and
the King of Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though this Gentleman know my
Thoughts as perfectly as if he had for
several years past lain in my Bosom,
yet he is mightily at a loss about my
Person: As if it at all concerned the
Truth contained in my Book, what
Hand it came from. However the
Gentleman is mightily perplexed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Author. Why, Sir? What
if it were writ by a Scribler of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomew</hi>
Fair Drolls, with all that
flourish of Declamatory Rhetorick, and
all that smartness of Wit and Jest about
<hi>Capt. Tom, Vnitarins, Vnits, and Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi>
&amp;c. Which are to be found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
115 and 123 Pages of a Book
that came out during the merry time
of Rope-Dancing, and Puppet-Plays?
What is Truth, would, I hope, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
be Truth in it, however odly
sprused up by such an Author: Though
perhaps 'tis likely some would be apt
to say, such Merriment became not the
Gravity of my Subject, and that I
writ not in the stile of a Graduate in
Divinity. I confess, (as Mr. <hi>Ed's.</hi>
rightly says) my fault lyes on the other
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50134:15"/>
side, in a want of <hi>Vivacity and Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
And I cannot wonder that one
of his Character and Palate, should
find out and complain of my <hi>flatness,</hi>
which has so over-charged my Book
with plain and direct Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in a matter capable of no other
Proofs. But yet I must acknowledge
his excess of Civility to me; He shews
me more kindness than I could expect
or wish, since he prefers what I say to
him my self, to what is offered to him
from the Word of God; and makes
me this Complement, that I begin to
mend, about the Close; <hi>i. e.</hi> when I
leave off quoting of Scripture: And
the dull work was done, of <hi>going through
the History of the Evangelists and Acts,</hi>
which he computes, <hi>p.</hi> 105. to take up
three quarters of my Book. Does not
all this deserve at least that I should in
return take some care of his Credit?
Which I know not how better to do,
than by entreating him, that when he
takes next in hand such a Subject as
this is, wherein the Salvation of Souls
is concerned, he would treat it a little
more seriously, and with a little more
Candor; left Men should find in his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50134:16"/>
another cause of Atheism, which
in this Treatise he has not thought fit,
to mention. <hi>Ostentation of Wit</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
he has made a <hi>Cause of Atheism p.</hi> 28.
But the World will tell him, That frothy
light Discourses concerning the Serious
Matters of Religion; and <hi>Ostentation</hi> of
triflng and misbecoming <hi>Wit</hi> in those
who come as Ambassadors from God,
under the Title of Successors of the
Apostles, in the great Commission of
the Gospel, is none of the least Causes
of Atheism.</p>
            <p>Some Men have so peculiar a way of
Arguing, that one may see it influences
them in the repeating another Man's
Reasoning, and seldom fails to make it
their own. In the next Paragraph<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I find
these words: <hi>What makes him contend for
one single Article, with the exclusion of
all the rest? He pretends it is this,
That all Men ought to understand their
Religion.</hi> This, I confess, is a Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I did not think of; nor would it
hardly, I fear, have been used but by
one, who had first took up his Opinion
from the Recommendation of Fashion
or Interest, and then sought Topicks
to make it good. Perhaps the defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50134:16"/>
due to your Character excused
you from the trouble of quoting the
Page where <hi>I pretend,</hi> as you say; and
it is so little like my way of Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that I shall not look for it in a
Book where I remember nothing of it,
and where, without your Direction, I
fear the Reader will scarce find it.
Though I have not <hi>that vivacity of
Thought, that elevation of Mind,</hi> which
Mr. <hi>Ed's.</hi> demands, yet common
sense would have kept me from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
that there is but one Article,
because all Men ought to understand
their Religion. Numbers of Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
may be harder to be remembred,
but 'tis the abstruseness of the Notions,
or obscurity, inconsistency, or doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of the Terms or Expressions
that makes them hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood:
And one single Proposition
may more perplex the Understanding
than twenty other. But where did
you find <hi>I contended for one single Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,</hi>
so as to <hi>exclude all the rest?</hi>
You might have remembred, that I
say, <hi>p.</hi> 44. That the Article of the
One only true God, was also necessary
to be believed. This might have sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50134:17"/>
you, that I did not so <hi>contend
for one</hi> Article of Faith, as to be <hi>at
defiance</hi> with more than one. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
you insist on the word <hi>one</hi> with
great vigour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from <hi>p.</hi> 108. to 121.
And you did well, you had else lost
all the force of that killing stroke,
reserved for the Close, in that sharp
Jest of <hi>Vnitarians,</hi> and a clinch or
two more of great moment.</p>
            <p>Having found by a careful perusal of
the Preachings of our Saviour and his
Apostles, that the Religion they propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
consisted in that short, plain, easie,
and intelligible Summary which I set
down, <hi>p.</hi> 301. in these words: <q>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
Jesus to be the Saviour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
and taking him now raised
from the Dead, and constituted the
Lord and Judge of Men, to be their
King and Ruler.</q> I could not forbear
magnifying the Wisdom and Goodness
of God (which infinitely exceeds the
thoughts of ignorant, vain, and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row-minded
Man) in these following
words. <q>The All-Merciful God seems
herein to have consulted the Poor of
this World, and the Bulk of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind:
THESE ARE ARTICLES
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50134:17"/>
that the Labouring and Illiterate Man
may comprehend.</q> Having thus plainly
mentioned more than one Article, I
might have taken it amiss, that Mr. <hi>Ed's.</hi>
should be at so much pains as he is, to
blame me for <hi>contending for one</hi> Article;
because I thought more than <hi>one</hi> could
not be understood; had he not had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
fine things to say in his declamation
upon <hi>one</hi> Article, which affords him so
much Matter, that less than seven pages
could not hold it. Only here and there,
as Men of Oratory often do, he mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes
the business, as <hi>p.</hi> 115. where he
says, <hi>I urge, that there must be nothing
in Christianity, that is not plain and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
levelled to all mens Mother Wit.</hi>
I desire to know where I said so, or
that <hi>the very manner of every thing in
Christianity must be clear and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible,
every thing must be presently
comprehended by the weakest Noddle,
or else it's no part of Religion, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
of Christianity;</hi> As he has it, <hi>p.</hi> 119.
I am sure it is not in <hi>pag.</hi> 255. 289.
292. of my Book: These, therefore to
convince him that I am of another
Opinion, I shall desire some body to
read to Mr. <hi>Edwards:</hi> For he himself
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50134:18"/>
reads my Book with such Spectacles,
as make him find Meanings and
Words in it, neither of which I put
there. He should have remembred,
that I speak not of all the Doctrines
of Christianity, nor all that is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
to the World in it; but of those
Truths only, which are absolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to be believed to make any
one a Christian. And these I find
are so plain and easie, that I see no
Reason why every body, with me,
should not Magnifie the Goodness and
Condescension of the Almighty; who
having out of his free Grace propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
a new Law of Faith to sinful and
lost Man, hath by that Law required
no harder terms, nothing as absolutely
necessary to be believed, but what is
suited to Vulgar Capacities, and the
Comprehension of Illiterate Men.</p>
            <p>You are a little out again, <hi>p.</hi> 118.
where you Ironically say, as if it
were my sense, <hi>Let us have but one
Article, though it be with defiance to
all the rest.</hi> Jesting apart, Sir. This
is a serious Truth, That what our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
and his Apostles preached, and
admitted Men into the Church for
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50134:18"/>
believing, is all that is absolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to make a Man a Christian.
But this is without any <hi>Defiance of
all the rest,</hi> taught in the Word of
God. This excludes not the belief
of any one of those many other
Truths contained in the Scriptures of
the Old and New Testaments, which it
is the Duty of every Christian to
study, and thereby build himself up
on our most Holy Faith; receiving
with stedfast Belief, and ready Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
all those things which the Spirit
of Truth hath therein revealed. But
that <hi>all the rest</hi> of the inspired Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
or, if you please, <hi>Articles, are
of equal necessity</hi> to be believed to
make a Man a Christian, with what
was preached by our Saviour and his
Apostles; that I deny. A Man, as I
have shewn, may be a Christian and
a Believer without actually believing
them; Because those whom our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
and his Apostles, by their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Discourses, converted to the
Faith, were made Christians and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
barely upon the receiving what
they preached to them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:50134:19"/>
I hope it is no derogation to the
Christian Religion, to say, that the
Fundamentals of it, <hi>i. e.</hi> all that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to be believed in it by all
Men, is easie to be understood by all
Men. This I thought my self autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized
to say by the very easie, and
very intelligible Articles insisted on
by our Saviour and his Apostles, which
contain nothing but what could be
understood by the <hi>bulk of Mankind;</hi>
a Term which, I know not why, Mr.
<hi>Ed's.</hi> p. 117. is offended at, and
thereupon is, after his fashion, sharp
upon me about Captain <hi>Tom</hi> and his
<hi>Myrmidons,</hi> for whom he tells me I
am <hi>going to make a Religion.</hi> The
making of Religions and Creeds I
leave to others. I only set down the
Christian Religion, as I find our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
and his Apostles preached it,
and preached it to, and left it for the
<hi>Ignorant and unlearned Multitude.</hi> For
I hope you do not think, how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptibly
soever you speak of <hi>the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable
Mob,</hi> as you are pleased to dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
them, <hi>p.</hi> 117. that the Bulk of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
or in your Phrase, the <hi>Rabble,</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:50134:19"/>
are not concerned in Religion, or
ought not to understand it, in order
to their Salvation. Nor are you, I
hope, acquainted with any, who are
of that <hi>Muscovite</hi> Divine's Mind, who
to one, that was talking to him about
Religion, and the other World, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
That for the <hi>Czar</hi> indeed, and
<hi>Bojars,</hi> they might be permitted to
raise their hopes to Heaven; But that
for such Poor Wretches as he, they
were not to think of Salvation.</p>
            <p>I remember the <hi>Pharisees</hi> treated the
Common People with Contempt, and
said, <hi>Have any of the Rulers, or of the
Pharisees believed in him? But this
People, who knoweth not the Law, are
cursed.</hi> But yet these, who in the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the <hi>Pharisees</hi> were cursed, were
some of the <hi>Poor,</hi> or if you please to
have it so, the <hi>Mobb,</hi> to whom the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
was preached</hi> by our Saviour, as he
tells <hi>Iohn's</hi> Disciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> XI. 5.</p>
            <p>Pardon me, Sir, that I have here
laid these Examples and Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
before you; a little to prevail
with you, not to let loose such
a Torrent of Wit and Eloquence
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50134:20"/>
against the <hi>Bulk of Mankind</hi> another
time; and that for a meer Fancy of
your own: For I do not see how they
here came in your way; but that
you were resolved to set up something
to have a fling at, and shew your Parts, in
what you call your <hi>Different<note n="*" place="margin">Preface.</note> strain,</hi>
though besides the purpose. I know
no body was going to <hi>ask the Mob
what you must believe?</hi> And as for me,
I suppose you will take my word for
it, that I think no <hi>Mob,</hi> (no, not your
<hi>Venerable Mob)</hi> is to be asked, what I
am to believe; Nor that <hi>Articles of
Faith</hi> are to be <hi>received by the Vote
of Club-men,</hi> or any other sort of Men
you will name instead of them.</p>
            <p>In the following words, <hi>pag.</hi> 115.
you ask, <hi>Whether a Man may not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
those Articles of Faith which
you mentioned out of the Gospels and
Epistles, if they be explained to him,
as well as that one I speak of?</hi> 'Tis as
the Articles are, and as they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.
There are Articles that have
been some Hundreds of Years explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
Which, there are many, and
those not of the most illiterate, who
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50134:20"/>
profess, they do not yet understand.
And to instance in no other but <hi>He
descended into Hell,</hi> the learned are
not yet agreed in the sense of it, the
great pains has been taken to explain
it.</p>
            <p>Next, I ask, who are to explain
your Articles? The Papists will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
some of them one way, and the
Reformed another. The Remonstrants
and Anti-Remonstrants give them dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
senses. And probably the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitarians</hi>
and <hi>Vnitarians</hi> will profess,
that they understand not each others
explications. And at last, I think it
may be doubted whether any Articles,
which need mens Explications, can be
so clearly and certainly understood, as
one which is made so very plain by
the Scripture it self, as not to need
any Explication at all. Such is this,
That Jesus is the <hi>Messiah.</hi> For though
you learnedly tell us, that <hi>Messiah</hi> is
a Hebrew word, and no better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by the Vulgar than <hi>
                  <unclear>Arabick</unclear>;</hi>
Yet I guess it is so fully explained in
the New Testament, and in those
places I have quoted out of it, that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50134:21"/>
no body, who can understand any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Sentence in the Scripture, can
be at a loss about it: And 'tis plain it
needs no other Explication than what
our Saviour and the Apostles gave it
in their Preaching; for as they preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it men received it, and that sufficed
to make them Believers.</p>
            <p>To conclude, when I heard that
this Learned Gentleman, who had a
Name for his study of the Scriptures,
and Writings on them, had done me
the Honour to consider my Treatise,
I promised my self, that his Degree,
Calling, and Fame in the World, would
have secured to me something of
weight in his Remarques, which might
have convinced me of my Mistakes;
and if he had found any in it, justified
my quitting of them. But having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
what in his concerns my Book,
I, to my wonder, find, that he has on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taken pains to give it an ill Name;
without so much as attempting to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
any one Position in it, how
much soever he is pleased to make a
noise against several Propositions; which
he might be free with, because they
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50134:21"/>
are his own: And I have no reason
to take it amiss, if he has shewn his
Zeal and Skill against them. He has
been so favourable to what is mine,
as not to use any one Argument against
any Passage in my Book. This, which
I take for a Publick Testimony of his
Approbation, I shall return him my
Thanks for, when I know whether I
owe it to his Mistake, Conviction, or
Kindness. But if he writ only for his
Bookseller's sake, he alone ought to
thank him.</p>
            <p>AFter the foregoing Papers were
sent to the Press, The <hi>Witnesses
to Christianity,</hi> of the Reverend and
Learned Dr. <hi>Patrick,</hi> now Lord Bishop
of <hi>Ely,</hi> fell into my hands. I regret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the not having seen it before I writ
my Treatise of the <hi>Reasonableness of
Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. I should then pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly,
by the Light given me by so
good a Guide, and so great a Man,
with more confidence directly have
fallen into the knowledge of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
which in the way I sought it,
in its source, required the comparing
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50134:22"/>
of Texts with Texts, and the more
than once reading over the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists
and <hi>Acts,</hi> besides other parts of
Scripture. But I had the ill luck not
to see that Treatise till so few hours
since, that I have had time only to
read as far as the end of the Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
or first Chapter: And there
Mr. <hi>Ed's.</hi> may find, that this Pious
Bishop (whose Writings shew he Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
as well as his Life that he believes
the Scriptures) owns what Mr. <hi>Ed's.</hi>
is pleased to call <hi>a plausible Conceit,</hi>
which, he says, <hi>I give over and over
again in these formal words,</hi> viz. <hi>That
nothing is required to be believed by
any Christian Man but this, That Iesus
is the Messiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Liberty Mr. <hi>Ed's.</hi> takes in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
places deserves not it should be
taken upon his word, <hi>that these for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
words</hi> are to be found <hi>over and
over again</hi> in my Book, unless he had
quoted the Pages. But I will set him
down the <hi>formal words</hi> which are to be
found in this Reverend Prelate's Book,
<hi>p. 14. To be the Son of God, and to be
Christ, being but different expressions of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50134:22"/>
the same thing.</hi> And <hi>p. 10. It is the
very same thing to believe that Iesus is
the Christ, and to believe that Iesus
is the Son of God; Express it how you
please. This ALONE is the Faith
which can regenerate a Man, and put a
Divine Spirit into him; that is, makes
him a Conquerour over the World, as
Iesus was.</hi> I have quoted only these
few words; but Mr. <hi>Ed's</hi> if he pleases,
or any body else, may, in this first Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
satisfie himself more fully, that the
Design of it is to shew, that in our
Saviour's time, <hi>Son of God</hi> was a
known and received Name or Appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and so used in the
Holy Writers. And that the Faith
that was to make Men Christians, was
only the believing that <hi>Iesus is the
Messiah.</hi> 'Tis to the truth of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
that he <hi>examines his Witnesses,</hi>
as he speaks, <hi>pag.</hi> 21. And this, if I
mistake not, in his Epist. Dedicatory
he calls <hi>Christianity. Fol. A.</hi> 3. where
he calls them <hi>Witnesses to Christianity.</hi>
But these two Propositions, <hi>viz.</hi> That
<hi>SON of God</hi> in the Gospel stands for
<hi>Messiah;</hi> And that the Faith which
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50134:23"/>
alone makes Men Christians, is the
believing <hi>Iesus to be the Messiah;</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleases
Mr. <hi>Ed's.</hi> so much in my Book,
that he thinks himself Authorized from
them to charge me with <hi>Socinianism,</hi>
and want of Sincerity. How he will
be pleased to treat this Reverend Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
whilest he is alive (for the Dead
may with good Manners be made bold
with) must be left to his decisive Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
This I am sure, which way
soever he determine, he must for the
future either afford me more good
Company, or fairer Quarter.</p>
