            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Whereof (my Lords) by the conduct of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,

and Advantage of your incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Magnanimities, after long Exagitations and Repugnance of Affairs, we have gotten more then a (glad) glimse, and by your unwearied Zeals may shortly obtain the ful Prospect and Fruition.

            <p>And because, to Tranquillity of Government, Corruption of Manners, and Mazing Errors are grandly opposite (these delude and distract, that doth deboish a people,) It will be your Prudence, Sirs, who sit at <hi>Helm,</hi> steering affairs of the first Magnitude, to debel and overrun the one, as it may be any ones part (who to common Weal oweth both himself and his Devoire) to abandon in his capacity the other, as Fatal thereunto; Which humble Attempt, my Lords, here Implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>The smattering (<hi>Sciolus</hi>) Soul of Lapsed man, in its most vigorous contendings unto Beatitude by its own Acies, cannot now (as in its estate of Native Innocence) with the <hi>Eagle</hi> behold the refulgence of Sunny Truths; Soaring in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Region of Contemplations, Penetrating the <hi>Arcana,</hi> and Essences of things; But through the flagginesse of her Pinion, flutters <hi>Estrich</hi> like, in grosse and earthy <hi>Idaeas;</hi> Forming sensual and faint conceptions, and in its survey, often taking shewes and shaddows for substances, gets the the minde great of Distemperature, and the State of Insecurity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:29807:3"/>But this <hi>Iargon,</hi> my Lords, or rather System of Logico-Theologie, as it will medicine the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, so it will purge out the humour and serve (with Heavens concurrence) as the Clew of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riadne,</hi> to guide the intricate and perplexed thoughts of the unfixed people through the great Labyrinth of Time, and involvednesse of affairs to a point of consistency; and as a <hi>Jacobs</hi> staff o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Astralabe, to help them in taking the dimensions and full heights of things, by an infallible Rule of certitude.</p>
            <p>And since knowledge is the excellency of man (seeing he abhorrs more to be accounted ignorant then vicious) surely the excellentest part of him (needs) must be that wherein this perfection in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrones, which being no other then intellect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Inferior Powers, challengeth the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Ayds and Organs: Of which kinde Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick (in our Native Tongue, as most rare, so) is the greated and most proper, which frameth and teacheth the use of Instruments accommodable to every operation of the understanding in its distinct and deliberate Quests of Truth.</p>
            <p>This quality in man is the true Philophers stone it turneth all that his minde toucheth into Gold and Treasure of satisfaction. It is <hi>Janitrix Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiarum;</hi> the Tutelary and Guardian of all, both Morall and Intellectual Habit: On the raisen wings of whose perfections, the prone and Rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Soul soars a pitch, Circuiting all the stately Provinces and Dominions of knowledge.</p>
            <p>This is that which by (Grace) recovers us to our Primogenial condition, unclouds the masqued mide, plows up, and useals the depths of Reason,
<pb facs="tcp:29807:4"/>
Evolves the hidden <hi>Idaeas</hi> of things, and unites the knottinesse of every emergency.</p>
            <p>By it are confuse things made Distinct; Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e, Obvious: And the Planetick thoughts to act Syncentrick, and in its Sphere. This also rang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the <hi>Pel-mel</hi> Conceptions to <hi>Battlia</hi> and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; It unforks Oracles, making them Toothlesse, turneth into Milk bony Paradoxes, and Cloudy AEnigma's to clear Sunshine.</p>
            <p>Ignorance, Sirs, benights the Soul, or rather Eclipseth it: By interposingit makes a man go all his way groping as he were blind: It is the Rack of ingenious and generous Spirits; who will oft rather drown then not dive beyond it; Nor did they ever finde a better way to chase or conquer it, then by Logicall Adjuments; The faithfull Organ to scent the footsteps of Truth (amidst the various Abolets of Error) in the Indagation and Researches after knowledge.</p>
            <p>It is a Zealous (but frivolous) Mistake of (the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) some that would be thought Christians in these times; That Learning aversates, &amp; Logick leadeth from the Grace and Truths of God: As if the Donations of Heaven were opposed, subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinated in mans tendency to Blisse and Glory; Can that be erroneous or bad, that teacheth what things be, or what be not, right and good? Such prove but the opinion of those men, who affirm the World groweth old, in their beginnings thus to dote and talk idly; Can there be contrariety in means that conspire one common end, mans perfection and happinesse? Gods gifts may serve, not shut out one another. Wherein Transcended us the first and second <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> too, as
<pb facs="tcp:29807:4"/>
to the Complement of their Natures, but in Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick and Philosophick endowments? The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall Imposition of Names, at first to things; That <hi>Herbal</hi> of <hi>Herbals,</hi> swallowed of Time; And the famous disputes with the <hi>Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drin</hi>-doctors, and Saducean Families, abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly argue the advantages of acquired Habits; Nor can the manner of their having them, diversie the Nature of them.</p>
            <p>By this time then it transpares, That, as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture needs Grace, so Grace desireth Nature: and Art both Grace &amp; Nature. Nature without Grace cannot do well; Grace without Nature cannot do at all: But Grace in Conjunction with nature and art, can do all things, as the great Apostle and Master of Learning affirmeth of himself; and as <hi>Symilus</hi> saith, Without Art Nature cannot be perfect, and without Nature Art can claim no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Now seeing this is the key of the Sciences, the study whereof is not more pleasing then profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and <hi>quisque cupit se beare:</hi> Why should it longer lie covert and concealed from the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity?

And why should the lesser Beauties of Knowledge, and Arts be vailed with, and confined to Forraign Languages (to the most, <hi>Barbarous</hi> and unknown) since science is no mans property?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:29807:5"/>I do not derogate Sirs from the Universities, which I know are the Seminaries and Founts of Learning and Liberall Acquisitions.

            <p>There cannot be a greater Prop (next that of quenching the heavenly Tapers of the Word) to the black Monarchy of the Prince of Darknesse, than the Engrossments and Enclosure of the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences (which this layes open.)

The want whereof agitates their lighter minds, scorched with flashing Zeal (unduly tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered and set on fire) to pinch the Magistrate of their duty, whilst they know it not perfectly, and Ravelling the bond of love in the unity of the

            </p>
            <p>And seeing Religion is the Pallisado, or rather the <hi>Palladium</hi> of Republikes, and knowledge the Cement of Religion; For that blesseth a people, this blasteth errour and drowns their breaches of Harmony; It importeth you Sirs whom God hath honoured with the chief Conduct of affairs, to promove both (which struck together, make a Diapason) since not-rare experience hath proved, where they have rung out for one, they have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to toll for the other.</p>
            <p>Indeed my Lords, you drive couragiously, you have almost doubled the Cape of <hi>Bon Speranze;</hi> Reformation and a happy peace will not longer ride at dead Anchor.

            <p>GOd hath made you an Ingenious and curious People, may he also make you wise unto Salvation. Not one of you (<hi>I presume</hi>) but would know much, and dispute well: This Book will serve you in both your ends. It will lead you through the plainnesse and depths of knowledges, both natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and Divine, which as yet perhaps seem Mysterious to you, and impenetrable; make it but your own, and you have conquered the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of all the Sciences; Truths that before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge'd you, will take you now but up to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</p>
            <p>Though it be a little one, it may live to do you much good: and like the Bee of <hi>Myrmecides,</hi> hath not the lesse Labour and Artifice. It is not
<pb facs="tcp:29807:7"/>
the Enchanted Egg of <hi>Oromazes,</hi> instead of universall happinesse, stuffed onely with winde and Vapor, or as the numerous Tomes of the Times, <hi>Cui quidlibet scribendi est Cacoethes;</hi> which serve but to beat down the price of waste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paper, and to make the world sit straight about you; but securing always the Interests of truth, It will teach you to dispute and form a right Judgement of any thing, to discern golden Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties from glaring and guilded; and to assure your faith against the strongest Sconces of error, to Raze or batter it.</p>
            <p>It will not lead you out of the right way (as some blind guides) but help you to reduce those that are strayed: From it, as from a spirituall Artillery, you may deprome all weapons of reason, to guard, not affront the truths of God (which not seldom suffer in mens hands.) But as the end of war is a calm and good peace, so Harmony and agreemement of spirit, is the Mark, or rather Center of disputings: for Fencing is but fooling in the Faith.</p>
            <p>Look then into it, go over it, and you will quickly see the use and Advantage of it: Judge it not by the Frontispiece no more then you would the Riches of the <hi>Indian</hi> Mines, by the barren and Raggy surface of the Earth, or the Treasure of a Lapidaries store by the presentment at his Window: Yet when you have read it, and (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance)
<pb facs="tcp:29807:8"/>
dispute whether it doth more please or profit you, know that as a passion to the common good both<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> conceived and brought it forth, so I have obtained, if growing up with the peace of the Nation, it shall beget any thing of Amity and Unity among the Saints: That <hi>Paul</hi> being nothing, and <hi>Cephas</hi> nothing, The God of Truth and Love may be All in all.</p>

            <head>The Art of <hi>Logick.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THe prime perfection and pleasure in this life<note place="margin">Generall rules to be foreknown of Logick.</note> (second to that supernaturall one, Faith in Christ blessed for ever, and Sanctification through the Spirit) consists in mans conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing according to understanding and Reason: i. e. to understand, know and judge distinctly of things as they are in their Natures.</p>
            <p>To the attainment of such a knowledge, three things are necessary.</p>
            <p>1 The object or thing to be known, <hi>viz.</hi> Every thing in Nature.</p>
            <p>2 A naturall faculty or power of understanding, which floweth from a reasonable Soul, and is innate to every man.</p>
            <p>3 A certain disposition whereby this power is ordinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and regularly, that is in order, and without errour, led into Act. Now this is either,</p>
            <p>1 Immediate, and by infusion of God, which is extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary and rare, and in these Ages of the Church promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to no person in particular.</p>
            <p>2 Or it is acquired, and gotten by information and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, which is frequent and ordinary.</p>
            <p>Now the disciplines disposing a mans understanding to the knowledge of things, are either.
<list>
                  <item>1 Objective.</item>
                  <item>2 Directive.</item>

            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:29807:9"/>1 Objective disciplines be such as handle things which<note place="margin">Objective disciplines.</note> are in Nature as Objects of our understanding, which are principally four.
<list>
                  <item>1 Theologie.</item>
                  <item>2 Jurisprudence.</item>
                  <item>3 Medicine.</item>
                  <item>4 Philosophy.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1 Divinity, called by the Greeks Theologie, which is the knowledge of God, and things Supernaturall, as they are Supernaturall, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>2 Jurisprudence, or Law, which takes in beside the special Laws of God and Nature, the Canon, Civil Laws, the Law of Nations, our Laws Common, Statute and Municipall, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>3 Medicine or Physick, both the Speculative and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctique.</p>
            <p>4 Philosophy, which comprehends Metaphysicks, which considereth things as they are such, &amp;c Also Physiques, or naturall Science; next of all Mathematicks, which contains Arithmetick, Geometry, Astronomy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Musick, Opticks, and last of all Ethicks, or Morals, containing Occonomicks and Politicks, under which again (beside History) is comprized Strategicks, called Martiall Discipline.</p>
            <p>Directive Disciplines be such as handle not the things<note place="margin">Directive discipline.</note> themselves to be known, nor do they inform or perfect the understanding of man in those things, but they prepare only some operation of man, and with framed Rules and Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments do guide and direct it.</p>
            <p>Now the operations of man requiring and needing such artificial Rules, are chiefly two. The first is the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing<note place="margin">
                  <p>
                     <hi>Observe.</hi> All faculties have two things in them, Matter, and Form, or somewhat not unlike; the Matter, Precepts; the Form, the order of the Precepts.</p>
                  <p>The Matter every faculty hath of it self, as of its own nature. The Form is by Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick administred.</p>
               </note> or cogitation of things. The second the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification either by word or writing of those cogitations (as for the Disciplines Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective of the signification of mens thoughts, as Grammer, Rethorick, Poetry, they are beside our purpose to treate here) and that which thus directs the understanding or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:29807:9"/>
is Logick only: to the consideration whereof, I<note place="margin">The AEqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of the word Logick.</note> mean the Homonomy and AEquivocation of the Word of Term, we now come.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>This word <hi>Logick</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Hath divers significations: For first is meant by it the<note place="margin">1 Naturall Logick.</note> power or faculty of the understanding and reasoning, which is innate, and floweth from mans Essence or Nature.</p>
               <p>2 It may be taken for a frame or constitution of Logical precepts, by this or that man written, called a systeme; which frame may be also taken for an Art, by a Metonomy of the Cause for the Effect, accepting Art not for an habit ingenerated in the mind by precepts and use, but for a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of universal precepts, to operate in a determinate la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and limit of End.</p>
               <p>3 It may be accepted for a certain part of this whole frame or constitution, namely that which is of a Syllogism Contingent or Commune.</p>
               <p>4 It may signifie an Act or Habit, begotten by precepts and use in the mind of the Artist; as when we say <hi>Peter</hi> is a good Logician: and this is the most proper signification of the word Logick, according to which we define it: So therefore</p>
               <p>Logick is an Art of ordering and directing of mans <note n="†" place="margin">The thoughts of mans mind is nothing else but his reason or understanding wholly oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupate about things.</note> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing<note place="margin">The first Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick. The second.</note> in the knowledge things: Or secondly,</p>
               <p>Logick is an Art that teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how to think and judge distinctly of all things.</p>
               <p>In this Definition are contained,

               <p>The Genus of Logick is an Art; for <note n="1" place="margin">Genus The five principall Habits of <hi>Aristotle.</hi>

               <p>4 Nor can it be Prudence, which teacheth things that are particular to be done and practised. It remains therefore that it be an Art: For,</p>
               <p>First it imitates and perfecteth Nature.<note place="margin">Reasons why Logick is an Art.</note>
               </p>
               <p>2 It presupposeth a certain end whereunto it directeth all the means.</p>
               <p>3 It is to be known, not for its own, but for the sake of some other; the profit thereof being in use, not speculation.</p>
               <p>4 It adviseth nothing of the means, it consults not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to use these or those means to obtain the end, for that they all are predetermined, and in a certain disposition or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinated to their end.</p>
               <p>5 It operates without any contrariety, or repugnancy of the appetite and affections, as not engaging or disengaging them.</p>
               <p>6 It is not commendable for the intent or purpose, but for the thing done, the work it self.</p>
               <p>7 It is not to be dispraised when it errs of set purpose and industry (for it could have done otherwise) but when it errs of ignorance and unwillingly.</p>
               <p>8 It is delivered by an Analytical and Resolutive me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, proceeding from the object and end foreknown, unto the means which are to be ordinated.</p>

               <p>Illative is such a moving of our Thoughts, as when by the repeating the co-ordination of things, that is, the third Term with the two former, we judge the co-ordination of these two Terms to be true or false: This discourse is that which is called Syllogistical.</p>
               <p>2 Ordinative is a moving of our thoughts from one part of the doctrine to another, that so we may judge how they consist and hang together. This discourse is called Methodical.</p>
               <p>The Object to which the understanding is directed and ordered, is every thing in Nature; for the understanding and comprehending of which in our thoughts, the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing needeth and seeketh rules of Logick.</p>
               <p>1 Of this object there is a three-fold partition of things.<note place="margin">Things to be known, threefold.</note> 1 Some are infinite, as God, and hereunto the serv'ce of Logical Instruments is not sufficient for the eliciting of a perfect conception or knowledge: Others are finite, and create; and of them some be spiritual and imperceptible by sense, and with much ado can the understanding conceive

them: Some also be corporall, and to know them and their instruments, Logical instruments chiefly serve.</p>
               <p>2 Things in nature are considerable two wayes. 1 Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminately without respect or restraint to Term, Place, or other circumstances, as a Man. 2 Determinately unto cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, as <hi>Peter Paul, &amp;c.</hi> About the first (as about things universal) are Logical instruments and directions pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily and principally used About the latter (as about singular) they are used but secondarily.</p>
               <p>3 Things are considered absolutely and in themselves, and so are called simple beings, or <hi>entia,</hi> or things, as a Man. Sometime as co-ordinate, and one with another, as a Man, a living creature: now they are called compounded. About the first, the first part of Logick is used; about the latter, the second and third parts.</p>
               <p>The proper end of Logick, is, the ordering and directing<note place="margin">3 End of Logick.</note> of mans cogitations (or the acts of mans understanding) in the knowledge of things; this is the true and proper end of<note place="margin">

               <p>3 Logick is the directory of the thoughts, making them regular, that whatsoever is conceiveable of a thing, may be drawn to a right sum, for an orderly processe in them, and to avoid confusion.</p>
               <p>4 When a man hath soundly and well thought on a thing, it enableth him exactly and in order to reach and write it.</p>
               <p>5 It causeth a man well to learn that which is well taught.</p>
               <p>6 It giveth a reflexive knowledge to a man, that is, it makes a man not onely know (directly) but makes him know that he knoweth a thing.</p>
               <p>7 It enableth a man to resolve what is compositively handled by others.</p>
               <p>8 It much avails and profits to conference and collati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whether occasional or other.</p>
               <p>9 By it, is a man enabled to an apt and regular placing and acquiring of intellectuall vertues, as on which depends the disposition and order of all disciplines, as to their frames and constitution.</p>
               <p>10 It is the rule of those habits a man hath acquired, instructing him to work aright; yet I mean but the rules of ingenious and intellectuall operations.</p>
               <p>11 In respect of man (that is to learn) it is the rule of all other disciplines whatsoever, but especially for Divinity. I say not, it is essentiall to the simple knowledge of things substantiall to salvation (for this may be by infusion from heaven, without any humane artifice) but I mean, the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way of erudition and skill to handle places in Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, depends on Logick.</p>
               <p>Now unto Logick (as unto every habit) are required three things, (as it were efficient causes of it) Nature, Method, Exercise.</p>

               <p>The term of a Word is that whereby the naming of a thing is considered; a word is the sign of things or concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, pronounced or written with a certain frame of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and syllables.</p>
               <p>In a word three things are remarkable.

               <p>The Materiall is the sound in the pronouncing of the letters and syllables, whereof the word is constituted, either in speaking or writing.</p>
               <p>The Formal is the signification of the word, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence the relation to the conceit of <hi>the minde</hi> which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>An ambiguous word, is which indistinctly signifieth things that in nature are divers, as <hi>Cancer,</hi> which signifieth both a living creature and a disease; hereunto all words that are Eqvivocall, and have divers senses are referrible.</p>

               <p>Of purpose doubtfull, is when a common name is given to divers things upon counsell, and for some certain reasons, and this again is doubtfull either of

               <p>Ambiguous by similitude of conceit, is, when two things altogether divers (as God and the Creature) obtain one and the same attribute or name upon the conception we make of some similitude betwixt them; so God and man are both said to be good, just, to repent, &amp;c. whereas really, no words can be found to expresse Gods most incomprehensible being.</p>
               <p>Ambiguous by similitude of things in reality, is, when the significations of their natures or operation bear an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and known similitude. As when meat and medicine are called healthfull, because both cause health: Or, as when a beast and a disease are called a Wolf, because of the rapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and ravenousnesse of both; and upon this account are the Seals of Gods Covenant called Sacraments, because of the correspondence and similitude they bear unto those So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Oaths, wherewith men were in former ages bound and consecrate to the Wars.</p>
               <p>Ambiguous of a Compound Similitude, is, whose like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse<note place="margin">e</note> consisteth of a proportion between four; and it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Analogie.</hi> As this word Governour is Analogical and<note place="margin">

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>1 The manner of receiving them into this order, is first Direct. 2 Proportional. 3 Collateral. 4 Indirect. 5 By accident: all which are declared by eight Rules follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>First then directly and primarily in the order or Predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental scale, is a thing which is, 1 Real and positive. 2 Simple and of it self. 3 Universal. 4 Compleat or Whole. 5 Univocal (that is) a thing signified by one distinct and certain word; these five are as it were conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of referribility in things unto a Predicamental order.</p>
               <p>2 Receiving things into this order, is by proportion; thus may God (blessed for ever) be brought in, not directly, because he is a most simple Being, one in Number, having neither Genus above him, nor difference to restrain him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause whereof, he cannot be placed in the Predicament of substance, but Analogically, and by proportion.</p>
               <p>3 Collaterally, side-wise, or obliquely; thus a difference is placed in the Predicamental scale or series (as a reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble soul, if it be taken for the difference of a living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is placed in the Predicament of Substance, but side<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, not directly: hitherto also may be referred Abstracts, to wit, Abstraction of Inferiours (as they are called) as Humanity, Animality, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>4 By Reduction, or indirectly: things placed in this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicamental scale, are first Concrete, and which simply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:29807:17"/>
not of one and the same thing, as just, mercifull, and other Concretes, containing both substances and accidents: so the Church, the World, and other like Collectives: hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther also may the parts of any whole be referred, as the head, hand, foot, &amp;c. but reductively, and by reducing them unto their whole.</p>
               <p>5 By Accident do appertain to the Predicamental order things compounded; and this they do by reason of their simple Terms, as Man is a living creature; this sentence is referred to the order of substance; A man is learned, this is referred to the order of substance in part, as it respects the man; and partly to the predicament of quality, as this man is learned. 2 Things Intentional, without the minde, as the Images of true things, colours seen in a glasse, &amp;c. 3 Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Notions, as words of Art, Genus, Species, Difference, &amp;c. 4 Relations of Reason, as the right or left side of a pillar, &amp;c. 5 Privations, which are alway referred unto the same Predicamental order that the habits thereof are; as blindnesse is in the same rank that sight is. 6 Fained things, things of fiction, as a Golden Mountain, <hi>Hirco-cervus,</hi> &amp;c. referred to the predicament of substance.</p>
               <p>6 From the predicamentall order be excluded plainly 1 All words of ambiguity and doubt, at least before they be distinguished and limited. 2 Fained things, which are absolutely impossible, as a Created God, Deified flesh, an unbloody Sacrifice, merit of works in a sinner, universall Election, and other such prodigious fantasies.</p>
               <p>7 A thing in it self simply one, pertains to one Predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; if it be Concrete, it may be referred to two, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equally, and so that it be primarily under one, <hi>viz.</hi> that which it most respecteth; so Baptisme and the Lords Supper are not to be referred to Substance or Action, but to Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, because water and the washing therewith are but the materiall things in Baptism; the formall being the holy Relation in signing and sealing the Spiritual washing away of sin.</p>
               <p>8 Lastly, things themselves are placed in the Predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of themselves and fundamentally; Conceits and Names of things but secondarily, and so far forth as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present things: and so much of the manner how things are received into the Predicamentall scale or order: we passe now to the second, <hi>viz.</hi> The degrees of the order, or Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camentall Series.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:29807:18"/>The degrees then of this Order, by which things are to be understood in their ranks, some are superiour, some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to others, and these degrees are not unfitly called Predicables.</p>

By which Canon or Rule, you may discern any, and many false gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, as that the body of Christ is not the true Genus or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper; that water is not the true Genus of Baptism, nor an action the Genus of sin, nor air of sound, that harmony or number is not the Genus of the soul, for such be not in one Predicament; by this also Metaphors are removed, as when the Church is called <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark, or the Spouse the body of Christ; these are true, but not the true genera or generals: for Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors shew not what a thing is, but what a thing is like to.</p>
                  <p>2 The Genus is never the cause of his Species, nor the<note place="margin">2</note> subject, nor the accident, and therefore is never predicated or spoken of his Species in the Concrete, but alwayes abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely in the right (that is the nominative) Case: They therefore erre, that in the Meteors make water to be the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:29807:18"/>
Genus of rain; fire the Genus of a Comet; air of the wind; whereas Meteors are called waterish, fiery, airy; so the cause cannot be the true Genus, as when dubitation is said to be the counterpoise of equal reason; Anger the boiling of the blood about the heart; Death the separating of the soul from body, &amp;c. In such, the causes are placed in stead of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals; so also for the subject, when we define wind to be the air moved; Original sin to be corrupt nature, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>3 The Genus is alwayes and necessarily more large than all the Species of it, and is not returned or reciprocated with them.</p>
                  <p>4 The Genus is inseparable from his Species; nor can that be the true Genus without which the Species are or may be in any, or any where: this proves motion cannot be the true Genus of pleasure, seeing pleasure may be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, where motion is not or ceaseth.</p>

                  <p>Also the Genus is either remote and afar off from the Species, or, 2 Neer and next unto it; as the Genera of a man, a living Creature is the remote Genus, and Animal is the neerest Genus; for there are none other so neer man as those two.</p>

                  <head>The Canons and Rules of a perfect Genus are five.</head>
                  <p>1 A perfect Genus hath a Nature not separated, but yet<note place="margin">5 Rules of a perfect Genus.</note> distinct from all his Species.</p>
                  <p>2 All that which is in the Genus is equally communicated with the Species, so as nothing can be said of the Genus,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:29807:19"/>
but the same also may, and must be said of every species.</p>
                  <p>3 The Genus is in Nature before all his Species, and therefore first in that knowledge which is according to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>4 The Genus hath necessarily many species, as not being able to be conserved in one; for every genus is perfected in determination of opposite differences, and opposition im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth plurality; so that one genus must of necessity have at the least two species.</p>
                  <p>5 A perfect Genus being put, there needs not therefore any determinate or certain species to be put; and if one spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies be denyed, the genus is not thereupon denyed.</p>
                  <p>There is an Analogy and similitude between a Genus and Matter: For first as the matter is more imperfect than the form, &amp;c. So is the genus more imperfect then the difference or species. 2 As the first matter is undetermined to any of his forms so is the genus to any of his differences; &amp; as the matters have a power unto the opposite forms; so hath the<note place="margin">b</note> generall unto the opposite differences; yet neverthelesse there is great discrimination betwixt the genus and the matter, and they be not the same.</p>
                  <p>An Imperfect Genus is that which is not communicated with his species equally and alike, but to one more, to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lesse.</p>

                  <p>2 An Imperfect Genus hath not a Nature altogether distinct from its species; so a <hi>thing</hi> naturally is not altogether distinct from substance or accident.</p>
                  <p>3 To put an Imperfect Genus, we must needs put some certain species, <hi>viz.</hi> that species by which it agreeth to the other; and this species being denyed, the genus it self is forthwith denyed.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The Rules hereof be four.</p>
               <p>1 The Species is in Nature after the Genus, &amp; in Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge distinct.</p>
               <p>2 It ariseth from the determination of the Genus, so as it swalloweth up, as it were, the whole Genus in it self; that whatsoever the Genus hath, it also hath.</p>
               <p>3 Perfect Species do equally participate of their Genus, one as well as the other.</p>
               <p>4 Perfect Specials be in Nature together. As a Man is not after a Beast in nature, though in time Beasts were first created. So Baptism and the Lords Supper be in Nature together (being alike Species of the Sacrament of the new Testament) though in time Baptism was first.</p>
               <p>Imperfect Species, is that which is under an imperfect<note place="margin">b</note> Genus.</p>
               <p>The Rules hereof be three.</p>
               <p>1 Under an imperfect Genus, one Species is more principal than another. So a Substance is the more principal Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of a Thing; An Accident is lesse principal.</p>
               <p>2 The principal Species of an imperfect Genus, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicateth as much to the other Species, as doth the Genus it self. So an Accident is as much bound to a Substance, as to a Thing.</p>
               <p>3 The principal Species is in Nature and Knowledge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the less principal, for it depends wholly on the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, and is that which it is, by benefit thereof. This Rule discovereth the Popish Errour, That in the Masse the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents of Bread and Wine should remain without the Substance.</p>

               <p>We have seen the direct degrees; now follow the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral,<note place="margin">b b</note> or sidelong, which is called Difference.</p>
               <p>Difference is here taken in a strict and peculiar significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">The Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note> only for the determination and restraining of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal and indifferent Nature, in the Predicamental order, and not for every distinction and diversity of things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we treat hereafter. And thus Difference pertaineth to the degrees of Order, not as constituting or informing, but as binding and knitting, not as causing any thing properly, but as determining and tying together the universal in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicamental line.</p>
               <p>The Difference is that which restraineth and determineth the Genus in the Species.</p>
               <p>The Rules hereof are eight.</p>
               <p>1 The Difference respecteth the general and the special in a divers respect: the general as determinable; the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial as determinated.</p>
               <p>2 The Difference, as it is a difference, never noteth a thing compleat and separate, but alwayes incompleat.</p>
               <p>3 The Difference is after the general, and before the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, yet is it in the general indeterminately, or in <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> power.</p>
               <p>Universals are like a long rope, loose without knot: diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is like a knot; the special is as a rope tied with a knot.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:29807:21"/>
The knot is after the loose rope, but before the knit rope: and the knot which in power was in the loose rope, is in act in the tied rope. A rope with knots differeth not really from a rope which hath not knots: so the Species restrained by difference, differeth not really from the Genus.</p>
               <p>4 Every Difference inferreth his proper and certain Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus. Therefore differences should not be transferred from Genus to Genus.</p>
               <p>5 The Difference that is to determine the general, must needs be opposite <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note>; for difference restraineth not the Genus, but by a kind of opposition and se junction of the Species.</p>
               <p>6 Every Difference is inseparable from his Species.</p>
               <p>7 The Difference is not varied by degrees.</p>
               <p>8 The Difference is apt to be avouched (<hi>praedicari</hi>) of his Genus, but in the Concrete, or in <hi>quale.</hi> For no difference sheweth what a thing is, but of what manner it is: As if one ask, What manner of living creature is a man: The answer is, A reasonable, living creature: so that the difference is not so much spoken of the Species, Man, as of the Genus, Living Creature, or Animal; for it maketh the Genus to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and determineth it.</p>
               <p>Difference is either,
<list>
                     <item>Far off.</item>
                     <item>Nearest.</item>

               <p>Far off, is that which is not reciprocate with his Species, called <hi>Generica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nearest, is that which is equal with his Species: It is cal-<hi>Specifica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As <hi>sensible</hi> maketh a man differ from a stone, in a far dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; for other Species, as Beasts, have the same diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, but reasonable is the nearest, whereby he differeth from a stone, beasts, and all other things.</p>

               <p>1. 1 Number is not coupled with any common term, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath its parts indued with Position. As 3 and 7 are coupled with no common Term, though they concur to the making of 10.</p>
               <p>2. 2. Of number, things are said to be even or odd.</p>
               <p>3. 3. Number also as it is number, hath no force, no effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie.</p>
               <p>4. 4. Number of it self hath nothing contrary thereto.</p>
               <p>5. 5. Number receiveth not more and lesse.</p>

               <p>Passion is the receiving of an Action.</p>
               <p>The Canons hereof are three.</p>
               <p>1 Passion, is received not so much by the condition of the Agent, as by the disposition of the Patient. So, many Passions and effects of the holy Ghost are imperfect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of us which receive them, not for the condition of the holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>2 Passion receiveth contrariety.</p>
               <p>3 Passion receiveth more and lesse.</p>
               <p>Passion is either. 1 Transmutative, or 2 Intentional.</p>
               <p>1 Transmutative, when some reall change is made in the Patient.</p>
               <p>2 Intentionall, when no real change is made, but onely a Termination of the Action. Thus a coloured thing is said to suffer, because it receiveth &amp; terminateth the sight. Some call this Spiritual and Logical Passion.</p>

               <head>Relation.</head>
               <p>We have seen the Order of Absolute Accidents: now followeth Relation, which is the Union of two or more.</p>
               <p>The Canons hereof are six.</p>
               <p>1 Every Relation is more unworthy than any Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Accident, and in Nature after it. For Relation is not a thing real by it self, but by the foundation of it, that is, either the subject, or the efficient cause; for every real thing added to another, maketh composition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion added to a Subject, makes no composition; for in God be many Relations, but in him is no Composition. So the name of a Doctor or Captain, given to a man, is nothing but a vain title and shadow, except there be qualities of Learning, Vertue, Fortitude. Also Relation may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from a Subject, it remaining safe as it was. So relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sacrament may be taken from the water, and yet be water still. So in us after forgivenesse of sins, there remains Original sin, as touching the material thereof, that is, inclination to evil; though the formal of it, that is, guiltiness, be taken away by Gods gracious imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>2 Relations do in company and multitude exceed all Absolute Accidents: for infinite references are added both to qualities, and all other Accidents. All disciplines are full of References. In Theologie, all Doctrines have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, as of sin, of the Law, of the Mediatour, of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in the Trinity, of Sacraments, of Miracles, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>3 Relation by it self is not perceived by the senses. As a man sees a stone in the field, but knows not whether it be a Dool stone, unless he be admonished of it. <hi>Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech</hi> saw <hi>Sarah</hi> to be a fair woman, but could not see her to <hi>Abrahams</hi> wife.</p>
               <p>The Relate and the Correlate, as they are such, are together both in Nature and knowledge, and so mutually do put or take away one another, as well in being as in knowing. So the Father and the Son, as they are Relate and Correlate, are together, though materially: as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is a man, he must needs be before his Son.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:29807:31"/>Hereupon Christ saith, <hi>He that knoweth me, knoweth the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5 Every Correlate doth so answer to his Relate, that the one may be said to be of the other So <hi>Adam</hi> was the Father of <hi>Cain,</hi> and <hi>Cain</hi> the son of <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6 Relations need no local Touching for the bringing in or conservation of themselves. As a Father being in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> may have a son born in <hi>France. Christ</hi> now bodily in Heaven, hath true and real union and eleaving with his members on Earth. The same body hath also true and real union Sacramental with the Bread in the Lords Supper. So as there needs no Popish Transubstantiation.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the Term of the Relation is not to be tied to the Relate, as the Communion with the substance and benefits of Christ, is not to be tied to the bread and wine in the Supper; nor the washing away of sins, to water in Baptism.</p>

               <p>2 As without a cause nothing is done, so also without it nothing is distinctly known. Therefore God is without Cause; for he is not made, nor done, but existeth of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>

               <p>There be four Causes. The Efficient, the Matter, the Form, the End.</p>
               <p>The efficient Cause, is that whereon the effect dependeth, and is

                  <p>1 No Efficient doth in vain, but all for some certain End.</p>
                  <p>2 The same Efficient Cause, as it is the same, alwaies doth the same thing.
<q>Idem, quà idem, semper facit idem.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>3 The Efficient Cause, properly so called, doth not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect but some good thing in it self. For evil things are not things properly, but defects of things. A Thief puts forth his hand to take another mans goods; this moving of it self proceeds from the soul that moveth, but the misorder [<gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Moreover the Efficient cause, as it is a cause, is alwaies a simple thing: so when a man is said to be the cause of his own accidents, properly he is not the cause, but the subject that hath the cause; and things are spoken of him, not as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects but accidents. A man is not the cause of laughter, but the commotion of the heart and midriffe by some ridiculous object known; neither is a man the cause of the faculty of laughter, but a reasonable soul.</p>

                  <p>1 The whole Instrument serveth for the Action of the Principall Agent, by whom it is directed. Therefore when it serveth not the principal Agent, it loseth the Nature of an Instrument. <hi>As</hi> men when they oppose themselves to Gods Commands and Rule, are not Gods Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but the Devils. Hereupon note, that an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment taketh the determination of his action from his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Agent. As Ink of its own nature blotteth the Paper, but it fashioneth no letter, unlesse the Writer guideth the Pen.</p>
                  <p>The whole force of an Instrument consists in the use; for then it is in Act a cause, when it is caused; but when it is idle, it is not an Instrument, but some other thing. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments have no dignity of themselves, but of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall cause, and serve not but in use and work; when the principall Agent can use them no more, they are no longer called Instruments, but <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>Co-operative, is that which by an inward force together is moved in producing the effect. As a servant is an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment used by his Master, yet so as he also moveth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. So the Creatures, though they be instruments in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of God, yet have they their action distinct from Gods. <hi>As Paul</hi> calleth Ministers Gods co-workers <gap reason="foreign">

Unto such instruments often is given the efficacie of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Agent, as Preachers are said to convert and save souls when the Lord doth these by them; so Baptism is said to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, &amp;c. by an improper predication; whereof here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after in the second Book.</p>
                  <p>Passive is, that moveth not it self at all, in producing the effect; as the earth under us is an instrument of walking, so a copy to write on other things, or a pattern: some instruments are necessary, some not, as God useth Angels, &amp;c. when as he needeth them not. And it is true the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal efficient cause worketh well by evil instruments, to wit when it needs not the instruments. As God made <hi>Joseph<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Also in divine things, often instruments do move, but it is all one as if they mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not; for the force of the effect is not in them. So <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> staff was moved at the dividing of the Red-sea, but this motion caused not the Sea to part, save only in a similitude.

                  <p>First, the Naturall Agent; That is called a cause by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, which brings not forth the effect of its own Nature, but by something that happens to it; as an Ague causeth temperance, not of its self, but by accident; for of it self the cause is the will, bridling the appetite. So knowledge puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feth up; The Law causeth wrath, for it lighteth on them that cannot keep it.</p>

                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:29807:36"/>2 In voluntary Agents, cause by accident is, which brings forth an effect besides the intent and purpose, or by ignorance: as a man cutting wood, his Ax-head flies off, and kills his neighbour unawares. Thus <hi>Judas, Pilate,</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> were causes,, by accident of <hi>Christs</hi> Passion and mans Redemption; for they never purposed, nor thought of such a good effect.</p>
                  <p>Hither belongs Fortune, which sometime is taken large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for any chance: as when a glasse falleth, and by fortune is not broken: sometime strictly taken, Fortune is the cause voluntary by accident, of that effect which one knew not, meant not, nor hoped for: as a man digging or plowing the ground, findes a bag of gold. Thus many things amongst men may be said to be done by fortune or luck, not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of God the first Cause, but in respect of secondary causes.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>The General Rules hereof be seven.</head>
                  <p>1 Every form properly called is a substance.</p>
                  <p>2 The form is the chiefest part of the essential compound, whereby it is constituted, and essentially distinguished from all others: Every thing is named not of the matter, but of the form: hereupon the form is called Act; for the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent matter is not in <hi>esse,</hi> but in power, till the form come; and this the Greek name <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> meaneth.</p>
                  <p>3 Unto the Form are due properly the operations of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry compounded thing. The form being put, three things are put: 1 the being of a thing, 2 the distinction of it. 3 the operation; and he that grants the form, grants the consequences of it, that is, the proper operations.</p>
                  <p>4 The Form in a diverse respect, assumes the relation of the efficient cause and end. Of the efficient in respect of the powers that flow from it, and operations in which the powers cease; and of the end, in respect of the beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and disposer, who intends nothing but the consequences of the Form.</p>
                  <p>5 Every Form is more perfect than the matter, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Natures scope, before it: wherefore the form is called <hi>species,</hi>

                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p>6 The Form by it self comes not into the senses; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is not endued with qualities, which are the Objects of senses: therefore man who begins to understand by sense, is very ignorant of forms, and their names; by reason whereof our knowledge is like the shadow in the Sun.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:29807:38"/>7 The Form is not varied by degrees, nor increaseth it by its self, though the whole compound be varied in quantity. For the Form consists in indivisibility; it is like a number, which if one adde to, or take from it, it continueth not the same it was before.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>First Form is, which in Order goes before all other: in Order I say, not of intention, but of generation: This also is called the first beginning active, and the common form of all bodies and Nature.</p>
                  <p>Second Form is that which follows the first; called also the inferiour and the particular Form, as Nature is called the Universal Form.</p>

                  <head>The General Rules hereof be six.</head>
                  <p>1 The End moveth the efficient to do; therefore is it called the cause of causes; for Matter without Form is rude. Form, if there want the preparing and efficient cause, is not brought into the matter; but the efficient worketh not, if it be not moved with desire; so without the end, no cause is caused.</p>
                  <p>2 The end by it self and in its own Nature, is only good and of good. So an End and Good are convertible; for the end is that which we most would: what we most would, is most to be desired, and desire naturally is alwayes order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to good. All vice wanteth both efficient and end.</p>
                  <p>3 Whatsoever hath an efficient cause, hath also an end.</p>
                  <p>4 The end is both cause and effect, in a diverse respect; so the celebrating of Gods Name, is mans action and <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>5 The end, as it is an end, is also before and better than the means: before it, not in order of production, but of perfection and intention: So Justification is before Faith, though also it be gotten by Faith. I say also (<hi>as it is an end</hi>) for otherwise as touching the absolute essence, the means may be as perfect, or more. Christs incarnation and office, hath greater perfection than mans Redemption, absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly considered.</p>
                  <p>6 The end and the efficient are causes each of other: the end causeth the efficient, as touching causality, not as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing being, and not causality.

                  <head>The Canons hereof are three.</head>
                  <p>First, No effect, exceeds the vertue of its cause: So the Sun, though it hath not formally the heat which it giveth, yet it hath it eminently, that is, something much more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent then that heat, namely, pure light. Absurdly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do the Popish Priests give unto Accidents the power of making a substance; for they say in the Masse, the accidents of Wine in the cup do change the water into another sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
                  <p>2 As is the cause, such is the caused; This is meant, 1 of causes by themselves, not of causes by accidents; therefore it followeth not, to say, This Ship-wright is a good man, therefore he makes a good Ship; for he makes the Ship, not as he is a man or good, but as he is a Wright or Artizen.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:29807:40"/>2 It is meant in causes natural, and those chiefly parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; so it followeth not, to say the effects of the Sun are hot, therefore the Sun is hot; for the Sun is a universal thing, and not a particular in causing. 3 It is meant of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses doing voluntarily, if they would produce an effect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formably: as a good Ship-wright makes a good Ship if he will. 4 It is meant upon condition and manner of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, not of the thing received; so the Argument follows not from the chief perfection of God to the chief perfection of the gifts in the Creatures; for God works voluntarily, and according to the measure of the receiver, and when we speak here of goodnesse, it is not meant moral goodnesse, but the Natural and Artificial faculty and force of causing, and by this many Canons of effects are to be understood.</p>
                  <p>3 That for which any thing is so, is it self so much more: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. This Canon hath three limitations. 1 The cause must be by it self; for it follows not, This man is drunken with wine; therefore this wine is more drunken; because wine maketh not a man drunken, but by the abuse of it. 2 It is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that that affection, whereof the cause and effect is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med such, be in both. 3 That it receive more and lesse.</p>
                  <p>1 The Mattered is, that which hangs on the matter.<note place="margin">2 Mattered</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the whole compound naturall body, is the caused of the matter.</p>
                  <p>3 The Formed is, that which hangs on the form. As the<note place="margin">3 Form.</note> said natural informed body.</p>
                  <p>4 The Destinate is, that which is ordered unto the End;<note place="margin">4 Destinate</note> it may also be called the Ended; for by the End it is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined; so vocation, justification, sanctification, are the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinates of Eternal Life; for they are ordered as means hereunto.</p>

                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:29807:43"/>2 Parts differ from their whole, though they be taken together: for, the whole is never the constituter, but the constituted, and the parts are alwayes constituters; and the same thing constitutes not it self; also the whole (as it is the whole) is one thing; parts, though taken together, are many.</p>
                  <p>3 That which is of a part, (as it is a part) the same al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so is of the whole, <hi>viz.</hi> according to that part. Note that some things are in the part as a part, that is, cannot be there, but in asmuch, and as long as it cleaves to the whole.</p>
                  <p>Again some things are in it, not as it is a part, but as it hath a substance diverse from the whole; and therefore those may remain, though separated from the whole: of this sort attributes and accidents are not rightly given to the whole, but onely to the part; as it is rightly said, The eye is mixt of humours, is round, &amp;c. for such is the eye, though it be pluckt out of the body; but it is not properly said, the eye seeth, the ear heareth, &amp;c. for those agree to those parts as they are parts and instruments of the whole, which if it be extinct, the eye seeth not, nor the ear heareth. The like is in all other parts, in every essential and integral whole that is one by it self; for in Aggregate totals, as a heap, &amp;c. it is otherwise; for they are not indeed totals; this hath great use in the Doctrine of Christs Person, which is the whole consisting of two Natures; for rightly and really do agree to the whole person the attributes of either Nature; fitly therefore it is said, <hi>Christ</hi> is omnipotent, as touching his <hi>Divinity; Christ</hi> died for us touching his <hi>Humanity;</hi> and this is more aptly spoken thus than in the Abstract.</p>
                  <p>4 Note, whatsoever is of the whole, is also of the part. Here distinguish between the <hi>whole Universal,</hi> and the <hi>whole Essential &amp; Integral.</hi> For whatsoever is in an universal whole, as an Animal, the same is in the parts of <hi>man</hi> and <hi>beast;</hi> but in other totals it is not so; for there, what the whole hath, cannot be properly given to the parts, because such parts receive not the definition of their totals, as in the <hi>Universal whole;</hi> it is not fitly said, the soul understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, thinketh, pitieth, &amp;c. but the man that hath the soul doth those things; so whatsoever is spoken of whole <hi>Christ,</hi> or the person of the <hi>Mediatour,</hi> is not properly spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Humane Nature, nor of the Divine.</p>

               <p>2 In Etymologies we must not go on without End, but must stay in some that is first; as the <hi>English</hi> word, <hi>Mix,</hi> may come from the <hi>Latine Misceo,</hi> and that from the <hi>Greek</hi>

               <p>3 Etymologies are taken from the end, effects, proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, object, and opposites of a thing; and are therefore from these to be derived, and these by those to be declared; as a River comes from the Latine <hi>Rivus,</hi> and both of them from the <hi>Hebrew</hi>

               <head>Distinction 2.</head>
               <p>A Distinction is, the freeing of a doubtfull word from the variety of hidden significations.</p>
               <p>The Canons hereof are seven.</p>
               <p>1 The Distinction of a doubtful word must be first in all consideration of things.</p>
               <p>2 When one word or name is given to things of divers Orders and kinds, it is doubtful, and needeth distinction; as if one speak of a Canker, it is to be known whether it be of the Canker-worm, or the Canker-sore, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>3 When a word is given to any in a diverse respect, <hi>viz.</hi> Absolutely, and by relation, it is doubtful, and needeth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction: as Justification is taken either absolutely, as it is in the Justified person only, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. or relatively to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, as he may acknowledge us to be justified by the effects of Faith. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>4 When a word meaneth sometime more things, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fewer, it is doubtfull: as Faith is sometime large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:29807:47"/>
used, sometime strictly; so Church, Grace, Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>5 When the opposite of any word is doubtfull, the word it self is doubtful; as Election to life hath opposite, Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation: Election to an Office hath no opposite; therefore Election is a doubtfull word.</p>
               <p>6 When a Primitive word is doubtfull, the Derivative is so too; and if one of the conjugates be doubtfull, so is the other; as Faith is diversly taken; therefore a faithfull man or infidel, is diversly to be taken.</p>
               <p>7 Distinction of a word, repugneth not the Nature and use of things, neither darkeneth it, but cleareth the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the minde, <hi>viz.</hi> a good distinction; but evil di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction doth darken and confound things.</p>

               <head>Illustration.</head>
               <p>8 The clearing or Illustration of a dark word, is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of it to perspicuity.</p>
               <p>The Canons hereof be four.</p>
               <p>1 When a word is dark by barbarousnesse or Soloecism, it is to be judged by Grammar Rules: as Transubstantiation is a monstrous word, and hath bred as monstrous opinions, so <hi>Opus operatum,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>2 When a word is dark for want of use, let a more usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and safe word be put in place: as the Sacrament of the Altar is an unproper word, not to be used for the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p>3 When a word is larger or straighter than the thing meant thereby, let another word, if it may be had, be put in the room; as when the word Clergy is applied to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters onely, which is said to be common to all the Saints, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>4 When a word is figurative, not for any need, but for finenesse sake, put a proper word for it.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>The Canons hereof are nine.</head>
                  <p>1 That which is rightly divided, must needs have parts;</p>
                  <p>Therefore the truth is ill divided into Philosophical; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is not an whole thing, but simple and impartible. So Omnisciency into Ubiquity, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>2 The divided and division should be without all doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness and darkness; as works should not be divided into operation, <hi>&amp; operantis;</hi> nor Faith into Historical, Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and saving Faith; not blindnesse into corporal and spiritual, nor liberty into civil and spiritual.</p>
                  <p>3 The members dividing should agree with the whole; therefore Logick is not well divided into Invention and Judgement, seeing these are actions, and Logick a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
                  <p>4 The members dividing should be equal to the whole; so ceremonies are ill divided into godly and ungodly; for this contains not the whole Nature of ceremonies, because some are mean or indifferent.</p>
                  <p>5 The members dividing should be disjoyned one from another; so a body, is ill divided into head, eyes, belly, heart, &amp;c. for the eyes are contained in that head, and the heart in that body, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>6 Division should be made into the next and immediate members: so a body is ill divided into man, beast, and tree; for many members that come between are leaped o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; for next a body is, either simple or compound.</p>
                  <p>7 Division should consist of as few members or parts as the nature of the whole that is to be divided will bear.</p>
                  <p>8 A true division should be made by those things which are in the whole, and not by the things outward and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents to the whole; so quantity is ill divided into Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:29807:50"/>
Physical, and Logical; for Disciplines are acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentary, and outward to things; neither is a thing by and by diverse, when it is diversly considered by sundry disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines.</p>
                  <p>9 A perfect division is the beginning of understanding, and of constituting the method of things and disciplines.</p>
                  <p>A perfect division also is either of

                  <head>The Canons hereof are two.</head>
                  <p>1 The divided must be a general; we must learn to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the diverse respects and considerations of things from the divisions; as when the Church is distinguished into visible and invisible, it is not properly a division, much less a division of the general into specials; for a Church is a lowest special; but it is only a diverse respect and manner of considering the Church; likewise when a man is divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to inward and outward.</p>
                  <p>2 The difference by whose means the general is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, should be essential and proper, <hi>viz.</hi> not translated from one general to another.</p>
                  <p>The division of the co-ordered, is which resolves the whole into parts co-ordered: and is either

                  <p>1 First, is when the Essential whole properly called is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved into matter and form: as a man into soul and body. And here, the true and next matter and form must be taken.</p>
                  <p>Secondarily so called, is when an Essential whole impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly so called, is resolved into his material and formal; as an Oration into a sound, or words written, and their sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification.

                  <p>1 Primary, is which resolveth into parts the entire whole properly called; as the Tabernacle was divided into the Court, the holy, and the most holy.</p>
                  <p>This manner of partition should be instituted in right order, descending from the more principall and greater parts unto the lesser.</p>
                  <p>Secondarily called, is, which resolveth into parts an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire whole improperly called, such as accidents be; as a Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logism is resolved into three Propositions and Terms: the Law into two Tables, or ten Precepts.</p>
                  <p>An imperfect division is, when the whole is resolved into<note place="margin">b</note> parts by accident; and it is either: 1 Of the subject into his accidents and circumstances: or 2 Of accidents by their subjects. 3 Or of the effects by their efficient, or fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal causes: or 4 Of causes by the effects: or 5 Of things by their objects: as 1 Of men, some are tall, some low, some learned, some unlearned, some dwell in hot countries, some in cold. 2 Agues, some are in the spirits, some in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, some in the solid parts. 3 The Scriptures, some were written by the Prophets, some by the Apostles.

               <p>1 Parabolicall similitude is the most fit instrument for plain and popular kinde of Teaching: Seeing all our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin proceeds from known to unknown, we must needs learn so much the more easily, as that is easie from whence the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of learning are taken, as, are in Parables, sensible things.</p>

               <p>3 Similitude must not be made between things too much dissevered; As some have compared the ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with the ten plagues of Egypt.</p>

                  <p>2 Privative Opposition admits a Mean; as, to the eye, twilight is a Mean between light and dark; God is neither moveable, nor immoveable, Privatively.</p>
                  <p>3 Privative Oppositions have extreams of the same Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, the Habit directly, the Privation indirectly; as sight and blindnesse.</p>

                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:29807:56"/>4 Habit and Privation are about the same Subject: As, because an Animall onely hath sight, therefore an Animall only is blind, not a stone, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>Totall privation, is from which there is granted no ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary regresse to the habit.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>The Canons hereof are three.</head>
                  <p>1 Totall privation is properly of dispositions, or powers onely.</p>
                  <p>2 Totall privation is beside Nature</p>
                  <p>3 From privation to habit no regresse is granted: As, he that is once quite blind, can never see more, <hi>viz.</hi> ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily.</p>
                  <p>Privation after a sort, or in part, is when an ordinary, and easie regresse is granted from the privation to that habit. As darknesse of the night, which at morning returns to light; so sleep to awaking, sicknesse to health, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Privation adventitial, or coming otherwise, is of a thing outwardly cleaving; as poverty is the privation of riches, imprisonment of liberty, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>2 Disparation is an opposition of specialls, arising from the division of one Generall by opposite differences; as a man and a beast are disparates, or dissevered.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>The Canons hereof are three.</head>
                  <p>1 Disparates never agree to the same things as they are
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:29807:56"/>
Disparates; So, bread is the body of Christ, cannot be spok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en substantially, but onely relatively, as bread hath relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Christs body.</p>
                  <p>2. Compleat Disparates do not concur as body and soul to make a man; so God and man concur to one hypostaticall thing in Christ, but not essentiall.</p>
                  <p>3. Repugnancy is opposition either between one Dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and the property of another, or between two or moe properties of Disparates, and also properties of contraries, and their antecedents and consequencies: As to fein, and to be indeed a friend, to be elect, and to fall from the grace of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To be bread, and to be born of the Virgin: To be prudent, and not to be able to dissemble anger; for this is Repugnant to prudency.</p>
                  <p>4 Contrariety is an opposition between two qualities that drive out one another.</p>

                  <p>Contrariety by its self is of qualites by themselves, and absolutely taken,</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>The Canons hereof be eight.</head>
                  <p>1. Of contrariety, each part is positive, as hot, and cold.</p>
                  <p>2. Of contraries, both are under a certain general, neer or far; As white, and black are under the general of colour.</p>
                  <p>3. Contraries are about the same subject, <hi>viz.</hi> either the generall or the speciall; But not always about the same in number, or those things which onely differ in Accidents: So white and black are in the same mixt body generally taken, but not in the same body in number; As a Swan, and a Raven, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>4 If one of the contraries be, the other also must needs be, or at least have possibility to be: If in nature there be fire, there must also be water.</p>
                  <p>5 Contraries cannot be in the same degree that excell; But may be in degrees that are remiss: So what is hot in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, is not cold at all.</p>
                  <p>6. One contrary if it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> overcomes, corrupteth another.</p>

                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:29807:57"/>7 The remission of one contrary often comes to pass by the weakning of the other.</p>
                  <p>8 Contraries have contrary Causes, Effects, Properties, and next Subjects: So Vertue is of God, Vice of the Devil, Temyerance helps health, Intemperance hurts it, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Contraties by themselves, are either

                  <p>Mediate, which do admit a Mean, <hi>viz.</hi> of taking part with the extreams; as heat and cold admit between, luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmness</p>
                  <p>Immediate, which do not admit a Mean: <hi>As</hi> Vertue and Vice.</p>
                  <p>Contrariety by accident, is which agreeth unto other things for the qualities: as fire and water are contrary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of heat and cold.</p>
                  <p>The secondary opposition is betwixt the Relation and the Correlate.</p>

                  <head>And they be ten.</head>
                  <p>1. Equal Valor of Propositions which is taken from the Signs of quantity, is shewed by the signification of the Signs and their mutual correspondence: These therefore are equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, <hi>Not every man is elected, and some man is not elected;</hi> there is no man that is not a sinuer, and every man is a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Not any man is good, and, No man is good, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>2. Diversity of words takes not away the equal value of sense, when the things signified by the words in the sense and meaning of the Speaker are the same: These therefore are equipollent, Bread is the body of Christ, and bread is the Communion of Christs body; For its Christs intendment, as <hi>Paul</hi> expounds him.</p>
                  <p>3. Equivalents should have Antecedent and consequent the same indeed: The transplacing of antecedents and Consequents changeth the sense of propositions; For these are not equivalent, to say, Bread is Christs body, and in bread is Christs body, or Christs body is in the bread; nor these, Bread is Christs body, and, let Bread be Christs body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Of Equivalents, one may be more forcible and signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant then another; and yet the agreement of sense remain safe: As these agree in sense, <hi>Bread is Christs body,</hi> and <hi>read is an holy sign of Christs body;</hi> Though the first hath a more forcible signification.</p>
                  <p>5. A Proposition of this sign [all] having limitation, is of equal value with the particular, when the limitation is taken away: as, All men that beleeve shall be saved, and, onely some men shall be saved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:29807:64"/>6 A proposition of the sign <hi>All,</hi> distributing into gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of the singulars, is of equal value also with a particular; as, God would all men to be saved; and, God would some of every sort of men to be saved.</p>
                  <p>7 A proposition of the sign <hi>All</hi> collective, is equall to an indefinite; as, All the outward senses are five; and there are five outward senses. Note also, that in the Hebrew, <hi>not all,</hi> is equivalent to <hi>none,</hi> as <hi>Psal.</hi> 143. Not all living shall be justified, <hi>i. e.</hi> no living.</p>
                  <p>8 Indefinites sometime are equivalent to universals, sometime to particulars; to those in a matter necessary, to these in a contingent.</p>
                  <p>9 The affirming of a privation, and deniall of an habit, are equivalent in an hable subject; as, He is not just, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is unjust; this is true in a man, not in an infant, nor in a stone.</p>
                  <p>10 He that puts one eqvivalent, puts also the other; and contrary, He that takes away one, takes away the other: so when Christ saith, <hi>Few are chosen,</hi> he saith in effect, All are not chosen.</p>

or Distinction be denied of the antecedent: as, A body is finite.</p>

                  <p>2 Contingent propositions chiefly consist of common ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, and integral parts lesse principal, and of adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: As, A man is white, is bearded, booted, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>3 Contingent propositions are said to be probable, when the truth of them is neither by sense nor by other reason manifest unto us; For that is probable, which when it can neither certainly be affirmed, nor certainly be denied, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth the assent unto the one part.</p>

                  <p>Sacramental, is, in which for the Union Sacramental, and certainty of sealing up, the thing signed or propriety thereof is given to the holy sign: As, Circumcision is a Covenant, the Lamb is a Passeover, Sacrifices are expiations of sins, Bread is Christs body, Baptism is the laver of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Bread is the Communion of Christs body, &amp;c.</p>

                  <head>Of this Foreknowledge there are three Canons.</head>
                  <p>1. Let the Word or Voice of both extreams be diligently examined, what it is, and of what sort; and if it be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, let it be carefully distinguished, and that distinction be presupposed in place of a Principle, as well for confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as refutation.</p>
                  <p>2. Let it be observed, whether the extreams of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion be universal or singular.</p>
                  <p>3. Let the causes, proprieties, and whole definition of both extreams be set down, either implicitely or expresly, as a certain and necessary Principle of the confirmation and refutation to come.</p>
                  <p>The Compound foreknowledge of the conclusion, is, when the nature, quality, and quantity thereof is considered.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>The Canons hereof are seven:</head>
                  <p>1. Let the conclusion or state of the controversie be rightly informed.</p>
                  <p>2. Let a compound or Hypothetical, never be put in
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:29807:74"/>
the place of a conclusion, but only a Simple or Categori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</p>
                  <p>3. That conclusion is more easily proved, which may be concluded in many figures and moods; And that which can be but in few, is harder to be proved.</p>
                  <p>4. An universal affirmative is hardly proved, not easily refuted.</p>
                  <p>5. An universal negative is easily proved, hardly refelled.</p>
                  <p>6. A particular affirmant is more easily proved, more hardly refelled.</p>
                  <p>7 A particular negant is easie to prove, most hard to refute.</p>
                  <p>2. Now followeth the taking of the <hi>mean</hi> by Collation of the extreams.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>mean</hi> or <hi>medium,</hi> is either Perfectly so called or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly.</p>
                  <p>Perfectly called, is that simple Term which being taken from the nature of both extreams, either knitteth or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyneth them one with another.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Hereof, are three Canons.</head>
                  <p>1. Every <hi>mean</hi> is taken from the Terms of both extreams in the conclusion, as well the natural, as the repugnant Terms; therefore he that would find a <hi>medium,</hi> must mind the general, the special, the causes, the accidents, the parts, the <hi>cognata,</hi> the opposites of both Terms in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</p>
                  <p>2. What manner of <hi>mean</hi> is required to make a Syllogism of this or that quantity, the Vowel Letters in the Modes of every Figure, do evidently shew.</p>
                  <p>3. The <hi>mean,</hi> though it may be taken from the part of the antecedent as wel as of the consequent, yet that is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted more noble which is drawn from the nature of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent; As for example, a <hi>mean</hi> is to be found to prove this conclusion, Every man is an <hi>Animal;</hi> mind the nature of this consequent <hi>Animal,</hi> and from it take the property of it, which is <hi>sense;</hi> this agreeth with both Terms, and is an excellent <hi>mean,</hi> or Argument to prove the conclusion, thus, Every thing that hath sense is an <hi>Animal.</hi> Every <hi>man</hi> hath <hi>sense;</hi> therefore every man is an <hi>Animal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. One and the same <hi>mean</hi> for a diverse respect of the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:29807:74"/>
Antecedent or consequent, may be referred to diverse places of Inventiom; as for example, A man hath sense, because he is an Animal: This Argument in respect of the Antecedent <hi>man,</hi> is from the place of the genus; but in respect of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent, it is from the place of the subject; for an Animal is the proper subject of sense.</p>
                  <p>5. Store of Means or Arguments is gotten chiefly two ways: 1. By deducing both extreams one after another through the places of invention, as well contingent as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary. 2. By discerning the principal means from the less principal; for example, take the consequent of thy opposed conclusion particularly, and lead it through the contingent places; argue and reason from the Notation of it, the likes, equales, conjugates, and the other contingent titles of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: which are at least 16. now thou hast so many Means. Then come to the others store-house of necessary places; and reason from the Genus, the difference, the subject and accident, the proper, the causes, and the other titles of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary places, which are at least 17. Then do the like a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Antecedent of the proposed conclusion; and thus maist thou have for one Conclusion fifty Means or Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: but not the store of Arguments is to be respected so much as the weight or force of them; three or four sound Arguments are enough to prove any common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</p>
                  <p>The Mean imperfectly so called, is when a Testimony, or speech of any Author is taken to prove the conclusion. This mean is called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> inartificial, because testimonies want artificial force to prove any thing of themselves. It is called also <hi>the Place from authority,</hi> that is, the dignity of the speaket.</p>
                  <p>And thus much of the constitution of a Syllogism; Now followeth the division of it.</p>

               <head>Of the Proprieties of a Syllogism.</head>
               <p>The Proprieties of a Syllogism are either
<list>
                     <item>General.</item>
                     <item>Special.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>General, are which agree to all the Figures together.</p>
               <p>And they are comprehended in these Canons.</p>
               <p>1. The disposition of a Syllogism is called by the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples set in the mind of man, of which the first is that which is called <hi>Spoken of All, and of None;</hi> to wit, when any thing is said or denyed of the Universal, the same is also said or denyed of the particulars contained under it.</p>
               <p>The other Principle is of proportion.</p>
               <p>Whatsoever do agree in one third Term, do agree be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween themselves; and they that dis-agree in one third, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree between themselves.</p>
               <p>2. In a Syllogism three Terms are only disposed, not more, nor fewer: The fourth Term must needs trouble the frame: For the <hi>mean</hi> is referred unto two: And four Terms may either be expressed, or implyed in a doubtful word; For every doubtful word, is a double word. Neither can there be lesse then three Terms; For two extreams cannot be disposed and knit without a third <hi>mean;</hi> Not but that one Term repeated more effectually may stand for two Terms; as in this <hi>A man in extream poverty is yet a man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The <hi>mean</hi> (or middle Term) may not come into the conclusion.</p>
               <p>4. If Abstract Terms be confounded with Concrete: and Oblique cases, with Right; so as the Principle of the spoken <hi>Of all, Of none,</hi> be violated, or that there be four Terms, the Syllogism must needs be naught.</p>
               <p>5. Let there be a right placing of consignificative, or exceptive, and restrictive words, lest that which pertains
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:29807:77"/>
to the conclusion be plucked from it, or lest the particular restrictive be twice repeated in the premises; For if that be, it is meer trifling; As in this example, <hi>Good, as it is good, is lovely;</hi> Justice is good, as it is good, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>6. A Syllogism consisting of meer particulars is naught. One Term must be universal, else 'tis against both those Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logistical principles noted before in the first Canon of All, and of None, <hi>and agreeing in one third;</hi> Moreover in pure particulars there be four Terms; For the <hi>Major</hi> speaks of one subject, and the <hi>Minor</hi> of another; As <hi>Some man is rich, some man is learned,</hi> Therefore learned men are rich.</p>
               <p>7. A Syllogism of meere Negatives is naught: For it is against the second Syllogistical principle, which will have the middle Term at least attributed to the one extream. Example, No Infidel pleaseth God; No Elect is an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del; Therefore, No Elect pleaseth God.</p>
               <p>8. Let the Premises in a Syllogism have the same kind of Attribution, or Predication; that is, the <hi>major</hi> must not be proper, and the <hi>minor</hi> improper, or otherwise. As, Bread is eaten with the mouth; <hi>Bread is Christs body;</hi> Therefore, <hi>Christs body is eaten with the mouth:</hi> Here that which is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted or spoken of the <hi>Bread,</hi> in the first proposition, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; in the 2d. figurative: the conclusion therefore is false.</p>
               <p>9. The <hi>major</hi> and <hi>minor</hi> Term, must be brought into the conclusion, as they were disposed in the Premises, not chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or maimed; Therefore it is not right to say; All sinners repentant find mercy; Some men find not mercy; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, some men are not finners: Here the conclusion is maimed, and is not as in the first proposition.</p>
               <p>10. There must be no more in the conclusion then was in the premises.</p>
               <p>11. The conclusion must imitate the more unworthy and weaker part that is premised: The worthiness is estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the quality, and quantity; so that an Affirmative is always more worthy then a Negative, and an Universal then a Particular. It is therefore ill to reason thus; Some faithful are saved; Every faithful man is called; Therefore, every man that is called is saved. Here, of a particular <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor</hi> is inferred a general conclusion; And it followeth not the weaker, but the stronger.</p>
               <p>12. In a Syllogism, sometime by reason of the form, a true conclusion is gathered from false premises: But it is
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:29807:77"/>
impossible for a false Conclusion to be gathered from true premises: Truth cannot be gathered from falshood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but by accident; as, Every man is a Living creature: Every man is a stone: therefore, Every man is a living creature: Here the conclusion is true, (by reason of the form) though both the premises be false.</p>
               <p>13. Of one Syllogism rightly framed, many conclusions may be gathered. And this, four manner of ways.</p>
               <p>1. By consequence; As, They that have communion with the Devil abide not in Christ, and consequently do not eat Christs body.</p>
               <p>2. By conversion of propositions; As, <hi>No elect</hi> abideth in sin all his life; Every believer is an elect; Therefore, none that abideth in sin all his life, <hi>is a Believer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. By inclusion of one proposition in another; As, All the Elect believe in Christ; Some men believe not in Christ; Therefore some men are not Elect; Therefore also it is false that all men are Elect; For in proving the truth of the one part of the contradictory, the falshood of the other part is included and proved.</p>
               <p>4. By descention, or undertaking a particular term under an Universal; As, All that conserveth society, is profitable; All vertue conserveth society; Therefore, all Vertue is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, Therefore every lawful contract (because it conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth society) is profitable.</p>
               <p>And thus much of the general properties, common to all the Figures. Now followeth the special.</p>
               <p>Of these some pertain to the
<list>
                     <item>Primary. Figure.</item>
                     <item>Secondary, Figure.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The properties of the primary Figure, are five, contained in so many Canons</p>
               <p>1. The disposition (or frame) of the first Figure, is most perfect: And this for three causes.</p>
               <p>1. Because the frame of this Figure most agreeth to natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral sense, and the Syllogistical principles that are in all men, and is of all the most evident.</p>
               <p>2. Because the Mean of this Figure, is indeed the Mean or middle in place and situation; whereas in other figures, it is the Mean <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and by reason of illation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:29807:78"/>3. Because in this, all kind of conclusion may be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Affirmative, Negative, Universal, and Particulars, which is done in none of the other Figures.</p>
               <p>2. In the first figure there is a proceeding from Universals to Particulars, or from the Genus to the Species.</p>
               <p>3. The <hi>major</hi> of the first Figure must alwaies be Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal.</p>
               <p>4. The <hi>minor</hi> must alwaies be Affirmative.</p>
               <p>5. The Antecedent of the <hi>minor</hi> proposition in the first figure, must be included in the Antecedent of the <hi>Major,</hi> as the Special in his General. This Canon is most profitable to be noted: For the whole frame, and form of this first figure is overthrown, if in the Antecedents of the <hi>major,</hi> and <hi>minor</hi> be two disjoyned things, and not subordinate one to another.</p>
               <p>The properties of the secondary figures, are either com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to both, as well the second as the third, or special to each one.</p>
               <p>Common to both, is imperfection arising both from lesser evidence, and from placing of the <hi>mean</hi> with the extreams.</p>
               <p>Imperfection requireth both

                     <item>Reduction, and</item>
                     <item>Exposition.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Reduction, is the transforming of a Syllogism formed in the first or second Figure, into a Syllogism of the first Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.</p>
               <p>Reduction is either
<list>
                     <item>Direct, or</item>
                     <item>Indirect.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>1. Direct, is, which is done by the only transposing, or turning of the Propositions, the extreams of the conclusion remaining.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>The Canons of this Reduction are eight.</head>
                  <p>1. Reduction of the second and third Figure unto the first, is not alwaies necessary; therefore not always carefully to be essayed.</p>
                  <p>2. The Consonants in the beginning and the midst, do shew the manner of Reduction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:29807:78"/>3. The Consonanrs in the beginning are four; <hi>B C D F<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> shewing unto which Mode of the figure, every Mode of the second and third figure is to be reduced; Namely to that which beginneth with the same Consonant. As <hi>Cesare</hi> and <hi>Camestres</hi> are reduced to <hi>Celarent; Festino</hi> and <hi>Felapton</hi> unto <hi>Ferio; Disamis</hi> and <hi>Datisi</hi> unto <hi>Darii.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Also the four Consonants in the midst. <hi>C M P S,</hi> do shew by what Instrument the reduction is to be made, whether by Conversion, Transposition, or deduction unto impossible.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>C,</hi> therefore noteth indirect Reduction, or that which is done by the Impossible, and is onely in those words, <hi>Baroco</hi> and <hi>Bocardo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. <hi>M,</hi> noteth that there must be a transposition made of the propositions, the Minor in the place of the Major, and the Major in place of the Minor.</p>
                  <p>7. <hi>P,</hi> noteth conversion of the proposition by accident: to wit of the <hi>minor,</hi> into which the syllable having <hi>P,</hi> falleth, if the syllable of the modes be rightly distributed into the propositions.</p>
                  <p>8. <hi>S,</hi> sheweth that there must be a simple conversion made either of the Major, or the Minor, and the conclusion together: as this letter is hard, either in the first, or midle, or last syllable: For if it be heard in the first syllable, As <hi>Cesare,</hi> it noteth the simple conversion of the major; if in the midst, it notes the conversion of the minor: And if in the last, the conversion of the conclusion, as in <hi>Camestres</hi> it is twice heard, in the midst and the last, and therefore noteth the conversion to be made of the Minor and of the conclusion. As take the syllogism in <hi>Cesare.</hi>

                     <pb n="142" facs="tcp:29807:79"/>Indirect Reduction, is, when we shew the evidence of the Illation by absurdity of the contradiction to be admitted.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>The Canons hereof are six.</head>
                  <p>1. Indirect Reduction hath place only in two Moods <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roco</hi> of the second, and <hi>Bocardo</hi> of the third Figure.</p>
                  <p>2 Indirect Reduction is made by concession, and by As<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sumption.</p>
                  <p>3. By concession, because the adversary granteth both premises, and yet denies the inference of the Conclusion.</p>
                  <p>4. The premises therefore, being granted, by supposition, the contradictory is to be taken of the conclusion, which is in the imper ect Syllogism, that is to be reduced.</p>
                  <p>5. The contradictory of the conclusion being taken, is put in the place of the <hi>Minor,</hi> if it be <hi>Baroco</hi> of the second Figure: and in place of the <hi>Major,</hi> if it be <hi>Bocardo</hi> of the third Figure: and so the <hi>Major</hi> in the second Figure, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way left in his place, as the <hi>Minor</hi> in the third.</p>
                  <p>6. Hence is made the conclusion in the first Figure, wherein contradiction is made to the proposition left of the imperfect Syllogism; and so the adversary is driven to an absurdity, that is, to the contradictory of that proposition, which before he had granted as true.</p>
                  <p>And thus much of shewing the evidence by Reduction.</p>

               <p>2. In the second Figure the <hi>Major</hi> must alway be Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal, even as in the first Figure.</p>

                  <p>2. The <hi>Minor</hi> must always be affirmant.</p>

As, <hi>Whole Christ is every where;</hi> whole <hi>Christ</hi> consisteth of the Godhead and the Manhood; therefore the Manhood is every where. Yea, though the Matter be good, the Form may be evil; as, <hi>God</hi> is the God of the <hi>living;</hi> God is the God of <hi>Abraham:</hi> therefore, <hi>Abraham liveth.</hi> Here, in the Conclusion, the Consequent of the <hi>Minor</hi> is impaired; which whole is not <hi>Abraham,</hi> but the God of <hi>Abraham.</hi> The Argument then must not be in the third, but the first Figure; thus, <hi>They, of whom God is God, do live;</hi> but God yet, is the God of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham;</hi> therefore he liveth: the <hi>Major</hi> followeth, because to be God, is to exercise Divine properties in the Object; and in whom such things are done, he must needs exist.</p>

                  <p>Primary, is, when the adversary by the contradictory of<note place="margin">a</note> the conclusion which he denyeth, and by the complication of a proposition manifestly true and granted, is driven to an absurdity.</p>

                  <p>2. Let a contradiction be assumed manifestly true, and which the adversary cannot deny; and let that be placed instead of the <hi>Major.</hi>

                  <p>4. From the absurd conclusion inferred, go back to the absurd proposition, or contradictory of the first conclu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sion.</p>
                  <p>5. The falshood of the <hi>Minor</hi> being shewed by the force of the contradictory principle, let it be shewed that the first conclusion is true, as, that whereto the <hi>Minor</hi> is contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily opposed; for example, <hi>Arians</hi> deny this conclusion, <hi>The Holy Ghost is God.</hi> I take the contradictory, <hi>The Holy Ghost is not God, but a Creature:</hi> and thus I infer, <hi>The spirit of God is not God,</hi> but a Creature; therefore, the <hi>The spirit of God is without God.</hi> This Conclusion is absurd; for no spirit is without that whose spirit it is: therefore <hi>Paul</hi> saith plainly, <hi>The spirit of God is in God.</hi> Therefore either the <hi>Major</hi> or <hi>Minor</hi> is absurd; not the <hi>Major,</hi> for it is manifest,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:29807:80"/>
the creatures are without the Creator; therefore the Minor: And therefore the right conclusion is true, which is opposed to this Minor.</p>
                  <p>6 Therefore a Syllogism leading to absurdity, is faulty either when the Major is infirm, or the conclusion not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd or opposed to a true conclusion.</p>
                  <p>7 A Syllogism leading to absurdity, much urgeth in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting, and hath the chief use in shewing the verity of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and specially of those conclusions which are nigh to principles, so as they cannot well be proved by demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration.</p>

                  <p>1 The converting to the converted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in all kinds of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, followeth rightly: as, No Infidel eats Christs body; therefore, None that eats Christs body is an Infidel.</p>
                  <p>2 That inference which is made from a contrary sense is neer kin to conversion by contrary placing: as, Vertue is to be praised, therefore, Vice is to be dispraised.</p>
                  <p>3 From the Superiour or Universall unto the Inferior or Particular distributely there is a good consecution: <hi>as, All sinners repenting finde mercy:</hi> Therefore all great sinners repenting do finde mercy. But from one particular to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it followeth not rightly; As to say: Some sin is not forgiven in the life to come, therefore some sin is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given in the life to come.</p>
                  <p>4 From the affirmative of a finite consequent (or attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute) followeth the Negative of an infinite consequent: as man is just, therefore man is not not-just.</p>
                  <p>5 From the affirmative of an infinite consequent follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Negative of a finite consequent, if the antecedent be capable of the habit: as, Man is not just, therefore neither is he just, neither un just. But of an infant it followes not, he is not just, therefore he is unjust; for he is not capable.</p>
                  <p>6 From a conjoyned consequent are inferred things di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, where there is no ambiguity nor repugnancy in the adject: as, Man is a living sensible body; Therefore man is a body, man is living, man is sensible. But it follows not, a Carkase is a dead man, therefore it is a man; For between a Carkase and a man there is a repugnancy.</p>
                  <p>7 From two or mo disjoyned consequents that cleave together by themselves, and are taken without ambiguity, we may infer conjoyned things: as, Man is a body, and he is mixt, and he is living, and he is sensible; therefore, man
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:29807:81"/>
is a living mixt sensible body. But it followeth not if one say; This man is a Musitian, and he is good, therefore he is a good Musitian; because Musitian and good, cleave together by accident; And there is ambiguity in the word <hi>good,</hi> which may be understood either of Moral good, or of perfection of Arts. Neither is this right to say; This servant is a <hi>father,</hi> and he is thine; therefore, he is thy <hi>father;</hi> For there is am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity in the word <hi>thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8 From an exclusive to an Universal of transposed terms, is a good consequence. As, Onely man can laugh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore whatsoever can laugh is a man.</p>
                  <p>9 From the removing of the one immediate member, unto the exclusive, is a good consequence: As, We are not justified by works: therefore by faith onely.</p>
                  <p>Dissentany consecution, is, when from the truth of the one<note place="margin">b</note> of the opposites is understood the falshood of the other; and contrary from the falshood of the one, the truth of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

                  <p>1 An Induction standing of particular propositions, may bring in all the particulars: As if one would prove that Wine heateth, he may reckon up all sorts of Wine in the World, as <hi>French, Spanish, Rhenish, European, Asian, Affri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Wine, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>2 When singulars are infinite, it is enough to alledge some chief, with addition of this clause, <hi>Neither can an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like example be shewn:</hi> As <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. to prove that all that are saved, are not saved but by faith, alledgeth <hi>Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, &amp;c.</hi> and at last
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:29807:82"/>
saith, There are many moe examples; Neither can any be shewed unlike to those.</p>
                  <p>3 An Induction may be made a Syllogism of the first Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, by putting in the place of the Major such a proposition in which the consequent of the conclusion is spoken of all particulars or singulars (reckoned up or understood) as of the mean; and adding a Minor, in which the same particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars or singulars are spoken of the Antecedent (or first part) of the conclusion. <hi>As, Spanish, French, Rhenish,</hi> and all Wines do heat. All Wine is <hi>Spanish, French, Rhenish,</hi> &amp;c. therefore, all Wines do heat.</p>
                  <p>Lesse Principal Induction, is, when one or two singulars<note place="margin">b</note> are induced, or when one is proved by another: As, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was justified by faith: therefore, other godly are so justified also.</p>
                  <p>Sorites is an imperfect Syllogism, wherein the consequent of the first proposition is made the Antecedent of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; and so forward as by a chain, until at length the last consequent be spoken of the Antecedent of the first propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position: <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>1 The reason of the consequence in a Sorites is both the connexion of the subordinates in the same predicament, and also the coherence of the causes and effects by themselves.</p>
                  <p>For Example. A man is an animal, an animal is a sensual body, a sensuall body is living, that that is living is mixt, that that is mixt is a substance: therefore, a man is a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; also, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. All foreknown are predestinate, all predestinate are called, all called are justified, all justified are glorified: therefore, all foreknown are glorified.</p>
                  <p>2 When terms not subordinate are confounded, and causes by themselves are mixt with causes by accident, the Sorites is naught: as, Of evil manners spring good Laws, good Laws are worthy of praise, things worthy of praise are to be desired: therefore, Evil manners are to be desired. This conclusion is naught; for evil manners are not causes of themselves of good Lawes, but by accident.</p>
                  <p>3 A denial makes a faulty Sorites, when it cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:29807:82"/>
to some figure; and begetteth either both premises negant, or a negant Minor in the first figure: otherwise when there is a good connexion of negative consequents or attributes, Negative Sorites are not simply to be rejected; as, Affliction bringeth patience, patience bringeth experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, experience brings forth hope, hope makes not asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, therefore affliction makes not ashamed.</p>
                  <p>4 When a particular proposition in a Sorites it put in the second or third place, or when the particular negant is put in any place, the Sorites is naught; for the Major is parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, or the Minor negant in the first Figure.</p>
                  <p>5 In a Sorites, the Antecedent or first part of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion is the Minor term, the consequent the Major; the other which besides these are found in a Sorites, are Means; and look how many Means, so many Syllogisms.</p>

                  <p>1 An Hypothetical Syllogism, consists of antecedent and consequent: the antecedent is of the first part of the Proposition; the consequent of the latter.</p>
                  <p>2 The Union of antecedent and consequent, is called the reason of the consequent, which is the very form of an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothetical Syllogism; and therefore if it cannot be granted, the hypothetical Syllogism must needs be faulty.</p>
                  <p>3 That Hypothetical Syllogism is good, which may be reduced to a good simple Syllogism; for as the perfect is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:29807:83"/>
the measure of the unperfect, so a simple Syllogism is the measure of a compound.</p>
                  <p>4 Therefore in an Hypothetical Syllogism, from the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of the antecedent to the conclusion of the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, the inference is of force, but not from the assumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or putting of the consequent, to the putting of the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent; for so in the second figure should be meer affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mants; as, If Infidels be grafted into <hi>Christ,</hi> they eat his flesh: But they eat his flesh; therefore they are grafted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christ. The Argument is not of force.</p>
                  <p>5 From removing the consequent to the removing of the antecedent, the inference is of force; but not from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the antecedent to the destruction of the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent; for so there should be a minor negant in the first fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure: as, If he be a man, he hath reason; but he is not a man: therefore he hath not reason. The Conclusion is true, but it followeth not of the premisses formally, but by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent onely.</p>
                  <p>6 When an Hypothetical hath three terms in the first Proposition, it is easily reduced to a Categoricall (or simple) Syllogism; for the reason of the consequence being granted, is put for the Major in a simple Syllogism, and then the Minor followeth of its own accord; as, If the Heaven be hot, it may be corrupted by another body: the reason of the consequence is, Every hot thing may be corrupted with another body that is cold; but it is not corruptible; therefore neither is it hot. Here of make a simple Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gism in the second figure, thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Every hot thing is corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Heaven is not corruptible: therefore Heaven is not hot.</p>
                  <p>7 But when four terms are in the first Proposition, the reduction is hard and laborious, because the reason of the consequence cannot so easily be rendered by a simple Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position: as, I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Justice be by the Law, Christ died in vain; But Christ died not in vain: therefore Justice is not by the Law. Here are four terms in the first Proposition.</p>
                  <p>2 A Disjunctive Syllogism is, which hath the first Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position a Disjunctive.</p>

                  <p>1 The whole force of the consequence in a disjoyned Syllogism, consists in the opposition and disjunction of the parts, whereupon that must needs be naught whose parts are subordinate: as, We have instruction either from God, or from our teachers; but it is from God; therefore not from our teachers. The disjunction is naught, for it disjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth things subordinate.</p>
                  <p>2 A right disjunction, requires a full enumeration of parts: if therefore a third part can be given, or a fourth, the disjunction is naught: as, Heaven is either <hi>Hot</hi> or <hi>Cold:</hi> but it is not cold; therefore it is hot,</p>
                  <p>Here the first proposition hath an imperfect enumeration; for we should adde, or else it is without all Elementary quality.</p>
                  <p>A Biformed disjunctive is, that when a disjunction of parts is made, which soever be granted, the adversary is fast:<note place="margin">d</note> it is called a Dilemma <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>1 The force of consequence in a Dilemma dependeth on the ful enumeration of the disjoyned members, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient removing of them both.</p>

                     <pb n="152" facs="tcp:29807:84"/>3 It is also without force if both members be granted, as making nothing against us. As the <hi>Jews</hi> reasoned against <hi>Christ: Tribute must be given to Cesar, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>4 Finally, A Dilemma hath no force if it may be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and returned upon the adversary.</p>
                  <p>Often also in the undertaking of a Dilemma, they are faulty in evil consequence, and then we must answer by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the consequence, as, Infants which while they are a Baptizing, do cry and resist, either they understand, or not: If they understand not, neither beleeve they; and therefore should not be baptized: If they understand, they are Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious that oppugne Gods Institution.</p>
                  <p>Here be evil consequences in both branches; for it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not, That Infants do beleeve, although they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand not explicitely what there is done. Neither followeth it, That they are Sacrilegious and repugne Gods Ordinance though they cry and struggle; for they stuggle not against the water as it is an holy sign, or with formal reason; but as it is a cold Element oftensive to their tender body. Even as a godly man that loves no wine, doth naturally abhor the wine which is in the Lords Supper; but he abhors it only as it is wine, and not as it is a Sacred signe of Christs blood.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>The Canons hereof are two.</head>
                  <p>Of which the first for foreknowledge of the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
                  <p>The latter is for finding out of the mean.</p>
                  <p>1. Every simple Notion handled in the first part of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick comes into the conclusion of a National Sillogism; for every second Notion may be compared with the first. We ask, Whether <hi>time</hi> and <hi>place</hi> be words conjoyned or abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute? Whether the Genus of sin be an action, or the Genus of faith be knowledge? Whether <hi>Antichrist</hi> is to be one sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular person? Whether faith be proper to the Elect? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther persons in the Trinity be really, modally, or formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly distinguished, and so of all other points. So as there is great use of a Notional Syllogism.</p>
                  <p>2. The Mean term for a notional Syllogysm, is easily taken from the nature and properties of that second Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of which question is made in the conclusion; so as from the first part of Logick the Canons of every second Notion may be put for the Major in the Syllogism, and then let the assumption be made affirmative or negative.</p>
                  <p>For example. It is asked, Whether an action be the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus of sin, or not. For a denyal, there is found out a mean term, from the nature and properties of a good genus. As by this Canon. No subject is the genus of that whereof it is the subject. l. 4. <hi>Top.</hi> cap. 6. But an action is the subject whereto sin cleaveth; therefore it is not the genus of sin.</p>
                  <p>Again, It is asked, Whether good works be the cause of Justification. Take for Major this Canon of a cause; No cause is after the effect; but good works are after Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for the person must first be justified and please God before he can do any good work: therefore good works are not the cause. And so of all other Notions, with their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons treated of in the first part of Logick, wherby appeareth the great use of those Rules: and that there needs here no long discourse of a Notional or topical Syllogism.</p>

               <p>Seeing every Syllogism is first absolute; As when we ask whether this be that or not: or else secondly Comparative, as when we ask whether this be more or lesse then that; here shall be added Canons of a Comparative Syllogism.</p>

                  <head>The generall Canons hereof are two.</head>
                  <p>The 1 For the foreknowledge of the conclusion. 2 The other to finde the Mean.</p>
                  <p>1 The conclusion of a Comparative Syllogism being contingent, and for the most part taken confusedly, need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth therefore diligent distinction and limitation: As it one ask, whether this or that be better; We must distinguish between better simply and absolutely, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, rather to be chosen in respect of time and place: So marriage is simply better than a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle life, because of propagation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. Yet single life is rather to be chosen in time of persecution, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.</p>
                  <p>2 The mean term of a comparative Syllogism, is hardly found by the places of reall invention; because the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute is most common, and almost Notional, not reall; therefore this is here handled after a Notional Syllogism.</p>
                  <p>The speciall Canons pertain either to the question as it is asked indefinitely, whether this be rather then that? or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the question as it is asked, whether this be better then that, or worse?</p>
                  <p>1 That which is such by Nature, is rather such then that which is not such by Nature; as, flowers are fairer then gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; For, they have a naturall beauty, these but an artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall.</p>
                  <p>2 That which maketh an other such, is rather such then that which maketh not; and if both do make, that which rather maketh, is rather such; As Fire is hotter then Water; for it maketh the Water such.</p>

                  <head>The Canons pertaining to a conclusion, better or not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, are these.</head>
                  <p>1 That which is more lasting and constant, is better than that which is lesse lasting; So 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. Love is better than faith; For love endureth alwayes.</p>
                  <p>2 That which is of it self good, is better than that which is good by another, and by accident; So, To live is better than to eat, because we eat to live, and live not to eat.</p>
                  <p>3 Simply good, is better than that which is good for some; As marriage is better than single life; Study of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better than Merchandize.</p>
                  <p>4 That is more excellent which is in the more worthy and honourable thing; As a Monarchy is the best Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; For God is a Monarch. It is better to give, than to receive; For God giveth onely.</p>
                  <p>5 The end is better than the means unto the end; As better is health than the use of Physick; better is peace than Triumph.</p>
                  <p>6 That which is possible, is better than that which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible.</p>
                  <p>7 That is better which of it self is more fair and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                  <p>8 That which is after, is oftentimes better than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; to wit, if other things be like, &amp;c. As, the later thoughts are better than the former.</p>
                  <p>9 Many good things are to be preserred before few.</p>
                  <p>10 That which effecteth many good things, is better than that which doth but few; So a Publike person is better than a Private.</p>
                  <p>11 That which is joyned with pleasure, is better than that which wanteth pleasure.</p>
                  <p>12 At what time a thing is more necessary, at that time it is more to be chosen; So comfort is better in sorrow than in prosperity.</p>
                  <p>13 That which is alwayes profitable, is better than that which is but sometime; So, Bread is better then all Phesants, Partridges, &amp;c. For it is alwayes needfull.</p>
                  <p>14 That which hath all kindes of good, as honest, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, and pleasant, is better than that which is under but one kinde of good.</p>

                     <pb n="156" facs="tcp:29807:86"/>15 That is most to be shunned, which most hindereth things to be chosen.</p>
                  <p>16 They are most to be chosen, whose opposites are most to be shunned: So prudence is better than knowledge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause imprudence is more hurtfull than simple igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
                  <p>17 That is best which is most famous and notable.</p>
                  <p>18 Hard things are to be preferred before easie.</p>
                  <p>19 Things that we may communicate with others, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially with friends, are better than those which we may not; So learning is better than health, liberality than tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance.</p>
                  <p>20 That is best which is most proper; So Gods grace is better for his children, than worldly riches; For <hi>these</hi> are common with the wicked, <hi>that</hi> proper to the elect; To use reason, is better than to use sense; For that is proper to man, this is common with beasts. So wit is better than memory, which many fools have.</p>
                  <p>21 Of those which are under the same Genus or Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, that is better which hath its own proper vertue; So cold water is better than hot; Natural gesture than af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
                  <p>22 They which are of abundant, seem better than neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary things; As to have fair cloaths better than mean, to be a good Artizen better than a mean.</p>
                  <p>23 Things that cannot be given by men, are better than those that can: So wit is better than riches.</p>
                  <p>24 That is more to be chosen, the abundance whereof is more to be chosen than of any other thing.</p>
                  <p>25 Better is when a thing may be chosen without an other, than when without an other it is not to be chosen: As prudence is better than strength.</p>
                  <p>26 Of what things we deny the one, that the other may seem to be in it; that is the better which we would have seem to be in it: So many deny they took pains about a thing, that they may seem to be witty; therefore, wit is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than pains taking.</p>
                  <p>27 Such things as whose losse we take not more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voussy, we are more blamed for, are more to be chosen, As children than riches, for we are more blamed if we be not sorry for losse of our children, than of our goods.</p>

                  <p>31 That which we choose for it self, is better than that which we choose for glory.</p>

                  <p>5. It ceaseth to be the testimony of God, if wrested ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to a wrong sense or unmeet allegories.</p>

                  <p>9. From Gods revealed will to his power, the argumeent alwayes is of force; But it follows not, because he will not, that therefore he cannot.</p>
                  <p>10. From Gods will Indefinite and Hypothetical unto the simple execution thereof, an argument is not of Force: as, God would all men should be saved: therefore, they shall all be saved; It follows not; For that Will is Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall or Conditional, If they believe.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Fallacie of the consequent, is, when there is a naughty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of the mean with the greater extream in the Major Proposition: as, He that said, Bread is my body, said, my body lieth hid in the Bread, but Christ said, &amp;c, <hi>Ergo</hi> It is a Sophism of the consequence, whereof no good reason can be rendred: So Christ taught us to pray for our daily Bread: therefore, Lay-men must not drink of the Wine in the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p>Fallacie from a thing spoken after a sort, to spoken sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, is when from the mean Term disposed with limitation, or after a sort with both or either of the extreams, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion is inferred absolutely and simply true: as, He that is lesse then the father is not equall with him; Christ is lesse then the Father. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. therefore, he is not equal with him. It is <hi>a</hi> Sophism from that which is limited, to that which is not limited. It should be thus, He that is lesse, simply and in all respects, is not equall: but then the Minor is false, For Christ is lesse, not in degree of Essence, or of substantiall perfection; But, First, By hiding the Godhead in the State of Humility. Secondly, By Office of Mediatour, whose parts he handleth with the Father. So he that saith, thy words are words, saith true; He that saith, thy words are ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">☜</note> words, saith, thy words are words: therefore, He that saith thy words are lying words, saith true. <hi>Answer,</hi> He that saith thy words are words, <hi>viz.</hi> Absolutely, or Indetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, not adding false difference, saith true, and so the Minor is false. Under this is contained <hi>Fallacia Accidentis.</hi>

                  <head>Of these three be three Canons.</head>
                  <p>1 When the form is plain, straightwayes we must think of the conclusion of the proposed Syllogisme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be constituted rightly, or opposed to our position.</p>
                  <p>2 When the conclusion is plain, We must answer to the Premises either by distinguishing and limiting, or by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>3 We must never answer by denyall when the argument<note place="margin">b</note> may be soluted by distinguishing and limiting.</p>

                        <item>2 By Contrary objection.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>1 Answer by Retortion, is, when we shew that the mean or proof brought by the adversary maketh for us, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth the same conclusion which he would prove by it, or at least other assertions of the adversary: As, Christ is first begotten before the creature: therefore he is a creature.
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:29807:99"/>
                     <hi>Answer,</hi> Nay, therefore he is not a creature, because he was begotten before any creature was.</p>
                  <p>2 Solution by contrary objection (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <p>3 Shewing of contradiction, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, is when we shew contradiction in our adversaries words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As, when the Papists except that in their Mass, Christ is not crucified again, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the sacrifice is unbloody; it is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: for a Sacrifice and unbloody are contradictory.</p>
                  <p>4 Opposition of equall authority, is, when to an humane Testimony we oppose another Testimony as good, or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>5 Comparison <hi>with like absurd,</hi> is when we compare our adversaris argument with the like absurd.</p>
                  <p>Indirect answer unto the <hi>person,</hi> is either<note place="margin">* *</note>
                     <list>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) is, when we blame the adversary for that he disputeth against Piety and Honesty, or against manifest sense and Experience.</p>
                  <p>A Comparison of the like, or greater, is, when we put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way any thing objected against our or an others person, with an other personall objection: As, Christ, when the Pharisees blamed his Disciples for eating with unwashed hands, <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,</hi> Why do you also transgresse Gods Commandments by your traditions?</p>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) when we mock the adversaries reasons as light.</p>

For a word of that language is to be preferred, which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth a simple thing most simply.</p>
                  <p>2 When the word is found to be simple; Let it be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered whether it be a Noun Abstract or Concrete.</p>
                  <p>3 It is also to be considered whether the word of the proposed Theme be certain, or ambiguous; and if it be am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous, let it carefully be distinguished.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="193" facs="tcp:29807:104"/>Let there be added a definition of the Noun; Either <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, according to the term, or <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Etymologie and Notation: And especially the latter.</p>
                  <p>5 Having considered the definition, think then careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Genus (or general) of a Theme; Namely, in what order of things, and how it is placed: and if it be no where found in this order among the predicaments, let it be counted for a <hi>Non <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ns;</hi> And so the handling of it be end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the consideration of the Name.</p>
                  <p>For example. If a man would treat of Purgatory; First, let him weigh the name; Then mind the Definition and Declaration of the Name by the Etymologie, <hi>viz.</hi> That by this Name is signified some Infernal fire; But some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what gentler, wherein the souls of them that are to be saved, must be purged, and rosted therein, so long as till full satisfaction be made for their sins. This Declaration of the name sheweth that such a fire there is no where: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Not to be sought in any predicament (or Rank of things.) And so it is but folly, either to define it, or declare it by the causes and properties thereof. But here note, that this consideration, <hi>Whether a thing be or not,</hi> is not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Existence (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) in some certain place, or time; but it is to be minded essentially (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) As if one would treat of Christs Incarnation; The question, <hi>Whether it be or no,</hi> is not to be minded so, as whether it be to day, or whether it shall be; But this is enough, that at any time it hath been, and now also dureth in effect, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Christ be no more Incarnate, nor brought forth. The like is also to be minded for things to come, as the day of Judgement, Resurrection, &amp;c. For though these have not yet Existence, yet have they Essence; and because it is sure they shall be, they are to be treated of, in order and manner of things that now are.</p>

                  <p>Primary treating is, which, when the beginnings of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition are foreknown, gathereth from them the Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and then useth the other Logical terms for explaning the term, according to those Canons that follow pertaining to the explication of a substance.</p>
                  <p>1 When the name of the theme is weighed, and the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full<note place="margin">A Theme substiantial</note> Genus found, let the difference be sought for, either by the predicamental Tables, or by some notable effect, or antecedent of a Theme known to the senses.</p>
                  <p>2 When the Genus and difference are found by its self, the Definition must be gathered and made.</p>
                  <p>3 The Definition of a substance being gathered, the form thereof and matter is distinctly to be considered.</p>
                  <p>4 Let the Form then be assigned, and (so far as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuity of the Doctrine will suffer) declared.</p>
                  <p>5 After the Form, let the matter generally be weighed.</p>
                  <p>6 After, the Integral parts, which make the matter entire; let those parts at least be considered which are most principal, and primary Instruments to bring forth the operations of the Form.</p>
                  <p>7 The efficient cause Principal and Instrumental, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it pertains not to the Essence of a Substance, yet it is to be considered for the knowledge of the Existence; The like is also to be minded for the final cause.</p>
                  <p>8 The proper accidents or effects flowing from the Form, and cleaving to the whole compound, must be reckoned.</p>
                  <p>9 Then let there be added a Division of the proposed substance, by the Primary accidents, by the Integral parts, inferring a manifest distinction; and if the Theme be a Genus, let the Species thereof be recounted, which
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:29807:105"/>
after may have their peculiar handling also if the handler be so purposed.</p>
                  <p>10 Let the things that are akin to the proposed substance be added.</p>
                  <p>11 And then let there be shewed the things that are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse and contrary.</p>
                  <p>For example, Let this Theme <hi>Animal</hi> (or <hi>living crea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>1 Weigh the name, which in Latine is of <hi>Anima,</hi> a <hi>Soul;</hi> which signifieth any living Form, which also is in plants; but is by an excellencie given to other sensible crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in whom the Soul more manifestly appeareth by sense and motion. In Hebrew it is called <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Cajah,</hi> of life; for that such creatures seem onely to have life. Of the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity of the name, or concretion, or abstraction, there needs none ado.</p>
                  <p>2 Next look for the Genus which is found in the Table of Substances to be a living body.</p>
                  <p>3 The difference restraining that Genus, is found in the same Table also to be sensitive.</p>
                  <p>4 The whole Definition therefore is, that an <hi>Animal</hi> is a living body sensitive.</p>
                  <p>5 The matter far off of an <hi>Animal,</hi> are the <hi>Instruments of life;</hi> The next matter is the Instruments of sense and motion; which taken all together are called the body of the <hi>Animal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6 The Form neer, is the Soul Vegetant; the neerest, is <hi>the Soul sensitive,</hi> which by the effects or proper accidents that cleave to the <hi>Animal,</hi> are as it were by the latter words evidently perceived.</p>
                  <p>7 Then come to the existence, and here weigh the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cause of an <hi>Animal:</hi> The principall Efficient, is the <hi>Forming of the youngling of an Animal,</hi> whereby the sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Soul is united with the body; The Instrumental cause is the Seed, the Womb, the Birth; all which may be treated of peculiarly.</p>
                  <p>8 The end is to be shewed wherefore an <hi>Animal</hi> was at first created, and wherefore in time gendered; The <hi>End</hi> U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal is the glory of God the Creator; The particular is <hi>the Complement of all the degrees of life, and so the perfection of the World and Creatures,</hi> which require not onely a Body vegetant, but also sensible.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="196" facs="tcp:29807:106"/>9 The proper accidents of an <hi>Animal</hi> are principally, 1 Sense Inward and Outward. 2 Appetite. 3 Going. Secondarily, 1 Breathing, 2 Watching, Sleep, Dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>10 The Integrant parts of the body or matter, are, 1 Similary parts, as blood and other <hi>Humours, Flesh, Bones, Sinews, Arteries.</hi> 2 Dissimilary parts principall, are the Brain, Heart, Stomack, Liver; and other lesse principal all over the body.</p>
                  <p>11 The division of an <hi>Animal,</hi> is, 1 By reason of the temperature and parts, into <hi>Male,</hi> and <hi>Female.</hi> 2 By the Species, into <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Beast,</hi> which also may severally and distinctly be considered.</p>
                  <p>12 The things akin to an <hi>Animal,</hi> are, Plants, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally those that are called <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>13 The Opposites of an <hi>Animal,</hi> are things that want <hi>Life, Sense</hi> and <hi>Motion;</hi> and <hi>Poysons,</hi> which are pernicious to the Life.</p>
                  <p>And thus much for handling a perfect Theme Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial.</p>
                  <p>A Theme <hi>Accidental</hi> is handled according to these Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons.<note place="margin">b A Theme accidental.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>1 After due consideration of the name, First think of the <hi>Order</hi> or predicament of the proposed accident; whether it be quantity, quality, Action, Passion, or Relation; For so it will appear, whether it indeed be an accident, or a <hi>Non ens,</hi> and feigned Theme.</p>
                  <p>2 When the Genus is found, let the <hi>Subject</hi> of the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent be shewed; And withall, consider whether the accident treated of, be common or proper; For these two have diverse explications; Wherefore an accident should alway be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to his first and even subject, that of a common it may be made proper.</p>
                  <p>3 Because Relation is busied between two Subjects, of which one is called the Relate, the other the Correlate, therefore in explaning of a relation, both of them must be assigned.</p>
                  <p>4 The Object then is to be minded about which the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident is occupied; and Objects bear rule in qualities and Actions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="197" facs="tcp:29807:106"/>5 The Principal <hi>efficient causes</hi> must be found out; First the neer, and then the neerest causes.</p>
                  <p>6 In Relations the <hi>ground</hi> or Fundament must be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and it differeth not from the neerest cause.</p>
                  <p>7 Then let the end of the accident be shewed, which also bears sway chiefly in quality and action.</p>
                  <p>8 But in Relations the <hi>Term</hi> must be enquired, which is the same with the final cause.</p>
                  <p>9 Then give the definition of the accident according to the nature of every predicament, assigning besides the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus the essential terms, as the Subject, the Object, the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cause, and the End.</p>
                  <p>10 Often also the Antecedents, Connexes, Circumstances and Consequences are to be reckoned; As when the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded Theme is an Action or Passion.</p>
                  <p>11 The effects of the proposed accident must be distinctly told.</p>
                  <p>12 A <hi>Division</hi> must be added, either into the Species, if the proposed accident be a Genus: or into other members fitting to an accident.</p>
                  <p>13 Then shew the things akin thereto, or which have some affinity of nature with the proposed theme.</p>
                  <p>14 Let the diversity which is between Themes akin be shewed.</p>
                  <p>15 Let the Opposites or Contraries be added.</p>
                  <p>For Example. This accidental Theme is to be handled; <hi>Calling upon God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1 The Name is absolute.</p>
                  <p>2 The Genus in the Predicament of Action is found to be this, <hi>a religious action.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3 The Subject of this Action, is, <hi>a faithfull man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4 The Object, First, to whom it should be directed, is the <hi>whole Trinity,</hi> and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled by the Son. Secondly, The Object of the things to be asked, which are Bodily and Spiritual. Thirdly, The Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for whom, <hi>is our selves and others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5 The Efficient cause principal, is, the <hi>manner of confidence,</hi> stirred up by the holy Ghost, by the authority and merit of Christ the Mediator, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. The outward moving cause (<gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>6 The end, is the <hi>obtaining of benefits, and thankfull glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying</hi> of God.</p>
                  <p>7 So the whole definition is this; Invocation is a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious action, or operation from the motion of faith, kindled by the holy Ghost, with trust and authority of Christ the Mediatour, done by a faithfull man, and directed unto God propitious in his Son, for the obtaining of good things need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and for the glorification of Gods holy Name.</p>
                  <p>8 The proper accidents or things requisite, are, First, That it be done in true faith without wavering. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. Secondly, That it be directed to Gods will. Thirdly, That it be with devout inward Motions and outward gestures (if it may be.) Fourthly, That it be not hasty, limiting God a time or manner. <hi>Jsaiah</hi> 28. Fifthly, That it be conceived with brief words without any redundance of speech.</p>
                  <p>9. The effects, are Union with God, joy and comfort of mind, the obtaining of good things needfull.</p>
                  <p>10. The Circumstances, are the place, now free. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. publike, or private; the time also free, at all hours, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>11. The things connexed unto it, are, purity of life, sobriety, tentations of the Devil much to be resisted.</p>
                  <p>12. <hi>The Division,</hi> is by circumstance of the place, publike or private: By the object: it is supplication (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <p>13. The things akin unto it, are, diligent reading of the Scripture, Meditation of holy things, continual diligence in the works of our calling.</p>
                  <p>14. The contraries, are, <hi>A</hi> corrupt conscience, an unclean life, doubting, profaness, and contempt, blasphemy and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecration.</p>
                  <p>And thus much of the primary handling of a perfect Theme.</p>
                  <p>The Secondary, is when the Definition of a Theme is put at the first beginning, and afterwards is resolved and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by parts: This way is commonly used of many in an

Ascention be a Natural moving, or Supernatural. And we may find it to be a Naturall moving, First, In respect of the Subject, which is a natural Body. Secondly, and in respect of the terms and mean. But in respect of the Efficient cause and end, it is Supernatural.</p>
                  <p>3 The Subject of this ascention, is Christs whole person; not absolutely, but restrictively, according to that part which could move from place to place, which is his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature. <hi>As</hi> for the Object, Local moving is not oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied about it.</p>
                  <p>4 The <hi>Antecedents</hi> far off, were Christs Ministery, and all that he did in his life, the neerer, are his Passion, Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, conversing after with his Disciples forty dayes, and bringing of them to <hi>Mount-Olivet</hi> &amp;c. The Connexes, are the term from whence; Namely, <hi>Mount-Olivet:</hi> The term whereto, namely, the Heaven of Heavens. The means by which, are the <hi>Air,</hi> and Sphere of fire, and other Orbs, thorow which his Body went. The Circumstance of places agrees with the terms; The time was forty dayes after his Resurrection: The other Connexes, were, the gazing of his Disciples, the appearing of the Angels, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>5 The principal Efficient cause, was the vertue of the Godhead, the inward moving cause (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) is Christs love to his Elect: The outward moving cause (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) is the profit and salvation of his Elect. The final cause in respect of Christ, is, the full possession of glory. Secondly, In respect of his Elect, to fulfill his kingly office, by defending and ruling of his Church; Also, his Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and Priestly office, by sending the holy Ghost to teach them, and the interceding for them with the Father.</p>
                  <p>6 Hereupon the <hi>Description</hi> ariseth, this, That Christs ascension was a Local moving, whereby he, as touching his body, leaving the earth on <hi>Mount-Olivet,</hi> came thorow all the Regions of the Elements by vertue of the Godhead into the glorious Heaven to possesse full glory, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his Church against all Enemies, and by the power of the holy Ghost from Heaven to teach and instruct, and by Intercession to commend us to the Father.</p>
                  <p>7 The <hi>Effects</hi> of his ascension, are, the sending of the holy Ghost, the gathering of his Church by the Ministery of his Apostles; the suppressing of the Enemies, and defence of his Church; sitting on Gods right hand, and Intercession.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="202" facs="tcp:29807:109"/>8 The Consequent of his Ascension, was, the Apostles wondering, and returning to <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> Fear, and dwelling together till the Spirit was sent down.</p>
                  <p>9 The things <hi>akin</hi> to his Ascension, were, his Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the ascending of <hi>Enoch,</hi> and especially of <hi>Elias.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>10 <hi>Diversity</hi> may be shewed between those; for the ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> was not a Victory over sin and the Devil; nor a triumph of merit, but of grace; not by their own power, but by anothers, &amp;c. And the Opposites of his ascension, are, His base estate on earth, and that disparition &amp; vanishing away, which Ubiquitaries feign of his Body, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>1 Let the name of the part in several tongues be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and the Notation shewed.</p>
                  <p>2 Because every Part is a thing <hi>Incomplete,</hi> a complete Genus or Species of it cannot be had, but it must be referred unto the predicament in which the whole is: therefore, by Comparison to the whole, and Relation to the whole, the Nature of the Part is of our understanding to be conceived; For every part is part of the whole; and if it be cut from the whole, it deserves almost no consideration, because the use of it is ceased.</p>
                  <p>3 It must be considered whether the part be Essential, or Integral.</p>
                  <p>4 If the part be Essential, let it be minded whether it be the <hi>Form,</hi> or the <hi>Matter:</hi> If the <hi>Form,</hi> it must chiefly be explained by his Operations, or Forces, and Effects. If it be the <hi>Matter,</hi> the disposition of it must be considered, by which it is apt to receive the <hi>Form,</hi> and so the Instruments by which the operations of the Form are wrought; and so let the whole body be subdivided into parts greater and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, lesser and least of all.</p>
                  <p>5 Let it be considered, whether the Integral part be si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar, or dissimilar: For Similars come rarely under consideration, because it is of the same name, nature, and properties with the whole, but dissimilars are wont chiefly to deserve explication.</p>
                  <p>6 In every part therefore, besides the name, there must be considered 1 The quantity and figure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2 The quality or temperature. 3 The situation, and how it is placed, and

knit with other parts. 4 The uses or actions of the parts, for whose sake this Instrument is of Nature made. 5 The lesser parts of which it is compounded.</p>
                  <p>7 After this, let the things akin to the part be weighed as are either parts like unto it; and finally let the Opposites be added, as are in mans body, the peculiar diseases of the parts.</p>
                  <p>The use of this Doctrine of the <hi>Part</hi> is chiefly seen in anatomies, and in astronomy, and architecture or building; But most of all in the anatomy, and parts of a mans body.</p>

                  <p>1 Besides the ambiguity of the name, and the Etymologie, let the <hi>Absolute</hi> accident be considered of which the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete</hi> is denominated, because the resolution of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete into the <hi>Absolute</hi> is the best explication of the <hi>Concrete.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2 In the accident absolute, whereinto the Concrete is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved; let the Genus, Causes, Objects, Effects, Things akin, and Opposites be considered, and let them be applied to the Concrete accident after the same manner.</p>
                  <p>3 In relations, concrets are often wont to be taken for abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutes, by the unheedy: therefore, there needeth great discretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>

                  <head>The Canons for explaining Collectives, are these.</head>

                  <p>2 Consider whither unto those many Subjects gathered together, there cleave any Relation, and then that Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to be explained by the Precepts given before.</p>
                  <p>For example. To treat of the Church, which is a collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of many singular persons, 1 Consider the name in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, Greek, and other Languages; And then mind it after a double kind. 1 In respect of the Material thing. 2 And in respect of the Formal. The Material of the Church, be Gods people: therefore, the Church may after a sort be referred unto Substance: And after a sort to quantity, or Number. But because to this Number there cleaves a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, therefore first of all thou must turn thy minde to Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For the Church is the <hi>Communion of Saints;</hi> and all
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:29807:110"/>
Communion is Relation. Now the Relation of the Church is twofold. 1 Of the members to the head. 2 And of the members one to another: therefore, the Church may be defined, The company of the Elect united in one head Christ, and one with another in the Bond of the Holy Ghost, unto the fruition of eternal Salvation.</p>

                  <p>3 If answer be given to the matter, as for the most part it is, he must look whether it be by the distinction of an ambiguous Word, or a Limitation, or a Denial; And if it be none of these, let the Answerer be minded to deal Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically, and to use some certain form of <hi>Answer,</hi> which is fitting unto either of the Premises.</p>

                  <head>The taking of the argument hath two Canons.</head>
                  <p>1 Let the <hi>Answerer</hi> diligently look that he take the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument faithfully without any Circumlocutions; and for that purpose let him take to himself some leasure.</p>
                  <p>2 If the argument be not formed by the Opponent, let him bid it to be formed; and if he cannot form it, let the Objection be rejected; or if the Form of the argument be not plainly desperate, let the <hi>Answerer</hi> himself form it.</p>

                  <head>His other Duty to <hi>Solve,</hi> hath these Canons,</head>
                  <p>1 When the Form is agreed of, let first the conclusion be minded, as whether the Opponent hath rightly formed the state of the controversie: and whether he hath lawfully opposed his position or conclusion unto our position.</p>
                  <p>2 If the conclusion be rightly framed, Let the minde have recourse straightway to the Major Proposition: As, weigh whether it be true, and whether it be simply true, or but after a sort, and whether it be compounded, having a faulty knitting or composition.</p>
                  <p>3 Let the <hi>Answer</hi> never be by denial, if the argument may be by Distinction and Limitation.</p>
                  <p>4 The Minor Proposition seldom comes to be limited, or distinguished, but often to be denied.</p>
                  <p>5 Let not the <hi>Answerer</hi> rashly reject the authorities of famous men, but deal thus. 1 Let him cause their words faithfully to be recited. 2 Let him reconcile them what he he can to his sentence. 3 If he cannot, then let him oppose the authority of another man as famous as he, or more.</p>
                  <p>6 To a direct <hi>Answer,</hi> which is so to be made as we now have shewed, let there be sometime added an indirect <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,</hi> as, chiefly a Retortion, whereby we shew how the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries argument maketh for us.</p>
                  <p>The duties of the Superiour Answerer or President, are two, to Rule, and to Help.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Ruling,</hi> Let the President diligently attend whether they dispute to the purpose, and abide in the matter that is within the lists of Disputation: which if it be not done, let him warn both the <hi>Opponent</hi> and <hi>Answerer</hi> of their duty.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Help.</hi> If the <hi>Answerer</hi> fail, let the President shew a more solid and firm answer; Yet, without the <hi>Answerers</hi>

                  <p>And thus much for Generation, or Syllogistical handling.</p>
                  <p>The Generation or handling of Method, is, whereby we frame a Method and Order to our Tractation.</p>

That he deliver the Principles of the Subject. 3. And that he follow the properties of the Subject which flow from the Principles or Causes.</p>
                  <p>4. Operative Disciplines are handled. 1. By the End. 2. By the Subject whereinto the end is to be brought. And 3. By the means whereby his end may be obtained. And this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod is called Resolutive, (<gap reason="foreign">

                  <head>The Canons hereof are three.</head>
                  <p>1. Let a Teacher be chosen Methodical and perspicuous, and one that knoweth the exact manner of teaching, and is willing faithfully to communicate it with thee.</p>
                  <p>2. A living voice is alwayes to be preferred before a dead or written.</p>
                  <p>3. Let the Learner meditate with himself alone the things heard or read, and let him take occasion of speaking to others that which he learneth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="213" facs="tcp:29807:114"/>The Ordination or ordering of studies hath these Canons.<note place="margin">2.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Let the Study of words be discerned at first from the Study of things, and let one time be bestowed in the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Tongues, another in the comprehending of things.</p>
                  <p>2. On Tongues, let the flowring years of youth be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed: For unto these there needeth little judgement, but only memory which hath vigor in youth.</p>
                  <p>3. Because Tongues are learned for the things, and Words are only Images of things: therefore less time is to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed in manly age, on words, then on things.</p>
                  <p>4. For the right ordering of the Study of any Tongue, two things are required. 1. A Methodical &amp; dexter Frame of the Art of Grammar. 2. A Comprehension of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of every word in that Tongue.</p>
                  <p>5. As for the Study of things, they are learned either in whole Disciplines, or in particular <hi>Themes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. Frames of Instrumental Disciplines must needs be learn'd before the Principal.</p>
                  <p>7. Instrumental Disciplines pertaining to things, are Rhetorick and Logick, needful to be learned before other Disciplines: For they are the keys whereby the doors of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Disciplines are unlocked.</p>
                  <p>8. Among Principal Disciplines, one may begin with Ethicks then proceed to Physicks, Mathematicks, Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicks, till at length they stay in Theology, or some other that is aimed at.</p>
                  <p>9. When the Frame of the Discipline is rightly ordered and comprehended in the mind, then come to the reading of Authors, which serve to confirm or illustrate that Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</p>
                  <p>10. The Learner must diligently distinguish the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries of the Precepts, from the Precepts themselves: and in the Precepts observe this Order, that he keep in mind the Definitions and Divisions, making Tables for the same use; And then, that he turn him to the Canons and Rules, and have them diligently, both in understanding and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</p>
                  <p>11. Let the Learner handle one Discipline only at one time; and having done that, let him go then to another in order as before is said, beginning at the Instrumentals.</p>
                  <p>12. In the Learning, let Ardent love of the thing which
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:29807:115"/>
is learned be cherished in thy mind; and that which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, let it be continued without interruption.<note place="margin">3</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Selection, is whereby the things which we read in others, worthy observation; or which we our selves do find out, we dispose under certain Classes and Titles: commonly it is called the gathering of Common places.</p>
                  <p>Common places are titles Methodically disposed, unto which things read and meditated, are referred.</p>
