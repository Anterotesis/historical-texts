         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <stage>Spoken by Mrs. CURRER.</stage>
            <l>GAllants, I vow I am quite out of heart,</l>
            <l>I've not one smutty Jest in all my part.</l>
            <l>Here's not one Scene of tickling Rallery;</l>
            <l>There we quite lose the Pit and Gallery.</l>
            <l>His <hi>London Cuckolds</hi> did afford you sport.</l>
            <l>That pleas'd the Town, and did divert the Court.</l>
            <l>But 'cause some squeamish Females of renown</l>
            <l>Made visits with design to cry it down,</l>
            <l>He swore in's Rage he would their humors fit,</l>
            <l>And write the next without one word of Wit.</l>
            <l>No Line in this will tempt your minds to Evil,</l>
            <l>It's true, 'tis dull, but then 'tis very civil.</l>
            <l>No double sense shall now your thoughts beguile,</l>
            <l>Make Lady Blush, nor Ogling Gallant Smile.</l>
            <l>But mark the Fate of this mis-judging Fool!</l>
            <l>A Bawdy Play was never counted Dull,</l>
            <l>Nor modest Comedy e're pleas'd you much,</l>
            <l>'Tis relish'd like good Manners 'mongst the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>In you, Chast Ladies, then we hope to day,</l>
            <l>This is the Poets <hi>Recantation</hi> Play</l>
            <l>Come often to't that he at length may see</l>
            <l>'Tis more than a pretended Modesty:</l>
            <l>Stick by him now, for if he finds you falter,</l>
            <l>He quickly will his way of writing alter;</l>
            <l>And every Play shall send you blushing home,</l>
            <l>For, tho you rail, yet then we're sure you'll come.</l>
            <l>Thus Brides are Coy and Bashful the first night,</l>
            <l>But us'd to't once, are mad for their delight.</l>
            <l>Do not the <hi>Whiggish</hi> Nature then pursue,</l>
            <l>Lest like <hi>Whig-Writer,</hi> he desert you too.</l>

               <hi>Whig-Poet</hi> when he can no longer Thrive,</l>
            <l>Turns <hi>Cat in Pan</hi> and writes his <hi>Narrative.</hi>

            <l>No <hi>Irish</hi> Witness sooner shall recant,</l>
            <l>Nor oftner play the <hi>Devil</hi> or the <hi>Saint.</hi>

            <stage> Spoken by Mr. JEVORN.</stage>
            <l>THo I am no great Conjurer you see,</l>
            <l>Nor deal in Devil or Astrology,</l>
            <l>Yet from your Physnomies I shrewdly guess</l>
            <l>The Poet stole the <hi>French Divineress</hi>
            </l>
            <l>But let not that, pray, put you in a passion,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Kidnapping</hi> has of late been much in fashion.</l>
            <l>If Alderman did <hi>Spirit</hi> men away,</l>
            <l>Why may not Poets then Kidnap a Play?</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:65233:2"/>Poets are Planters, Stage is their Plantation,</l>
            <l>But tho they are for Trade and Propagation,</l>
            <l>Yet don't like <hi>Thievish Whiggs</hi> Rob their own Nation.</l>
            <l>But, Fellow Citizens, beware Entrapping,</l>
            <l>For, whilst y'are busie sending Folks to <hi>Wapping,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>'Ygad your Wives e'ne go abroad <hi>Kidnapping.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Tending to this, of late I heard such stories,</l>
            <l>That I for safety Marry'd 'mongst the Tories.</l>
            <l>And see from City Prigg I am become</l>
            <l>A <hi>Beau Garcon,</hi> a man of th' <hi>Sword: rare Thumb!</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Ierné</hi> I am all <hi>Tory</hi> now, <hi>par ma foy</hi>
            </l>
            <l>I hate a <hi>Whigg:</hi> I 'm <hi>l'Officiere du Roy.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And now I bid defiance to the City,</l>
            <l>Nor <hi>Whig,</hi> nor <hi>Critick</hi> shall from me have pitty.</l>
            <l>And as in Valour, I in Wit am grown,</l>
            <l>Then to'em <hi>Gillet</hi>; let 'em know their own.</l>
            <l>You <hi>Whigs,</hi> but <hi>Criticks</hi> are amongst the <hi>Cits</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And <hi>Criticks</hi> are meer <hi>Whigs</hi> amongst the <hi>Wits.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Thro your cross Nature you'l no mercy show,</l>
            <l>But would the <hi>Monarchy</hi> of <hi>Wit</hi> o're throw;</l>
            <l>And <hi>Criticks</hi> here with the same spirit stickle</l>
            <l>For <hi>Liberty,</hi> as Whigs in <hi>Conventicle</hi>
            </l>
            <l>'Gainst <hi>Sheriffs</hi> and <hi>Poets</hi> equally you Baul,</l>
            <l>You Riot in a <hi>Play-House,</hi> they 't <hi>Guild-Hall.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>But Noise, you see, and Faction often fails,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Law</hi> is our Shield against your <hi>Prot'stant Flails</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Law</hi> and large <hi>Fines</hi> may send you all to Jails.</l>
            <l>And if you <hi>Criticks</hi> here are troublesome</l>
            <l>I'l <hi>Diametrically</hi> upon you come.</l>
            <l>And maul you with my Charm, <hi>Firm, Close, Standfast Thumb!</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Then there's your Wheadling Critick, seems a Friend,</l>
            <l>Commends by halves, and with a <hi>But</hi> i'th' end,</l>
            <l>Has sly reserves which still to Faction tend.</l>
            <l>They praise a Play, and on the Poet fleer,</l>
            <l>But, his back turn'd, loll out their tongue and Jeer.</l>
            <l>Thus amongst <hi>Wits,</hi> as <hi>Whiggs</hi> too, these are Trimmers,</l>
            <l>They'r like a sort of <hi>Half Crowns</hi> we call Swimmers.</l>
            <l>Broad to the Eye, but though the Stamp seems fair</l>
            <l>Weigh 'em they're light, and damn'd <hi>mixt Metal</hi> are.</l>
            <l>These blame the <hi>City,</hi> but uphold their <hi>Charter,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>They Rail at <hi>Treason</hi>; but give Traitors Quarter,</l>
            <l>And when a <hi>Rebel's</hi> hang'd, they stile him Martyr.</l>
            <l>For <hi>Perjur'd Villains</hi> they wou'd have <hi>Reprieve</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And to <hi>False Witnesses</hi> can <hi>Pensions</hi> give,</l>
            <l>Yet won't allow a <hi>Mayor</hi> may choose his Sheriff.</l>
            <l>They cry, to Magistrates we'l give all Honor:</l>
            <l>But let's have <hi>Law</hi>: —Then Holloo—take him <hi>Coroner.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>But, Friends, don't think that you shall longer Sham us,</l>
            <l>Or that we'll Bugbear'd be by your Mandamus;</l>
            <l>You see <hi>Dame Dobsons</hi> Devil long was famous,</l>
