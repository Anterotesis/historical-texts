         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>THomas Criſp,</hi> Thou or ſome other of thy Party having directed a Printed Paper to me, called<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Babels Builders unmasking themſelves</hi>; I have read the ſame, and well conſidered the Contents there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and do find that not only a great deal of Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty but alſo of Falſhood and Contradiction is contained in it, which when it is laid before thee in a Spirit of Love and tenderneſs, from one that ſeeks and deſires thy Salvation, it may be may have ſome effect upon thee to the abating thy fooliſh raſhneſs, and may bring thee to a better conſideration of thy work, which is that I chiefly deſire and aim at: elſe am not apt to meddle with things of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, having never loved Controverſie for Controverſie ſake: but am one that ſatisfies my ſelf in an aſſurance of Faith in the power of the living God, believing it will break and confound all that riſe up againſt it as it hitherto hath done.</p>
            <p>Now conſidering the time in which thou haſt publiſhed thy Book againſt us, it ſeems to be the only time the Devil could have taken advantagiouſly to work in the minds of people a belief of our being in a hidden Confederacy with <hi>Rome,</hi> when many of them of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> Religion have by their wicked works rendred themſelves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the puniſhment of Juſt Law, and to the abhorrence of all good men, at ſuch a time it is that thou renders us, the people called Quakers, to be at leaſt half way in Unity with them, having taken ſuch a ſtride over to them, as ſuch another may make us meet and embrace, as in <hi>page</hi> 9. and that our Judgment, or the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which we take part with is <hi>bare faced Popery,</hi> as in <hi>page</hi> 14. and in divers other particulars in thy Book: by all which thou doſt but ſhew how willingly thou would have us fallen upon as Papiſts, or render us ſuſpitious both to Magiſtrate and the Vulgar, by thy
<pb facs="tcp:43946:3"/>
crooked Inſinuations, as dangerous perſons to the true Proteſtant Religion. Oh <hi>Thomas</hi>! who hath ſet thee on work herein, and ſo timed thy Book, is manifeſted in the ſight of God, to be the Father of Lies, with whom thou wilt certainly have thy reward if thou Repent not. And when all is done of this kind that thou and you can do, yet ſhall we appear in the ſight of God, and in the ſight of the Magiſtrates, and in the ſight of the men of this and after. Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to be in our principles and practice, and life too, at a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſtance from that ſort o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> men thou would link us to, than ever your Ranting Libertine Spirit will lead you; and when you ſhall ſee us delivered from the evil you thought to bring upon us, and ſee our Teſtimony ſhine over the heads of Papiſts and you too, and your ſelves (for want of the Divine Aſſiſtance of God's power) crowch and truckle under, as you do already to the Spirit of this World, then will you gnaw your Tongues for very pain, and the reward of your Enmity will come upon your own pates, with a witneſs. Therefore if there be yet a day, ſeek Mercy and forgiveneſs at the hand of the Lord before he comes to render his Vengeance upon you for all your hard Speeches, which ungodlily you have Spoken, Written or Printed againſt the Lord and his Heritage, a People that fears his Name, and walks in the Light of his Day everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, upon which your Clouds and Smoke can no more bring a Night.</p>
            <p>In the next place, I take notice of thy deceit and falſhood in this little Book which is grounded upon a Lie, <hi>viz. G. F. G. W.</hi> and <hi>A. P.</hi> have not denied the matter of the <hi>Barbados</hi> Paper, they have not given one word of Reproof to it; nor diſowned the principles therein contained, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> now how notorious falſe this is every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biaſſed Reader may Judge; <hi>Firſt,</hi> They declare that this (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Matter or Doctrine of the Paper) would be the way to bring them all from the meaſure of the Spirit in their own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. What <hi>Thomas,</hi> is this not a word of Reproof? is this not a diſowning the Principle? It's well ſaid, <hi>A Lyar had need of a good Memory.</hi> Again, all are to give up to the Uuniverſal Spirit of God in their own Particulars; what, is not this a diſowning the Poſition of the Paper neither! Again, as to Subſcriptions to an outward tye be above ſuch things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we deſire you would ſtop this Paper for going any farther, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What! not a word yet of Reproof or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owning in all this, but <hi>G. F. &amp;c.</hi> muſt bear the reflection of this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
<pb facs="tcp:43946:3"/>
as if he and they had been the Authors of it; Hath not thy Enmity betrayed thy Reaſon, and robbed thee of common Juſtice and Ingenuity too. Yea, but thou objects, <hi>page</hi> 11. that they are more afraid of the publication, than aſhamed of the matter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This ſeems to me a very ſilly Allegation, for if the Paper were ſo much according to <hi>G. F</hi>'s, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> minds, yea, the very product of what we had laboured for a long time; what ſhould make <hi>G. F.</hi> or any of us afraid of the publiſhing of it? hath that ever been our practice, to be afraid to publiſh the Concluſions and Agreements of Friends and Brethren, who in the name and power of God have concluded and agreed upon things that we knew would ſtand and be juſtifiable by God's Witneſs, though we knew they would meet with oppoſition from bad Spirits; What needed <hi>G. F. &amp;c.</hi> care what bad Spirits or Apoſtates would ſay of the Paper if they got it; but only becauſe we knew there was a ground given them ſo to ſay; we uſe not to be afraid of what you can ſay to us or our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, which are wrirten in the true and Divine Authority of the power of God which is over you all: but let them go abroad freely for you to ſay your worſt to them, as knowing that barking at nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Sun nor the Moon can keep them from ſhining: ſo that it muſt needs appear that it was the diſlike that <hi>G. F. &amp;c.</hi> had to the Paper that cauſed them to deſire the ſtopping of it more than for fear of the uſe you could make of it; and yet that fear not wholly excluded neither, knowing that you might juſtly reflect upon it in ſome things which we could not ſtand by.</p>
            <p>But thou ſeemeſt to be highly offended at the kind and friendly language of <hi>G. F. &amp;c.</hi> in their Paper by which thou ſhews how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſavour thou haſt of the Spirit of a true Chriſtian or Chriſtian Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, who is to reſtore ſuch as are overtaken in a fault in the Spirit of meekneſs; what if they ſaid, <hi>We know you mind the beſt things,</hi> the Letter being written to a Body of people, dare thou ſay that none of them do mind the beſt things? Yea, they were that very day minding how they might keep down ſuch looſe Libertines that had for a long time ſought to diſturb the peace of their Chriſtian So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; though they might poſſibly exceed in the method of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding with them by the Arguments or influence of ſome few among them. What then, muſt they all be unfriended and denied Brotherhood hereupon, and be written to as wicked and ungodly,

               </gap> to quote my words though fallaciouſly, to make a ſeeming oppoſition between us, that I ſaid the Paper was not only ill worded but ill meant; my words did not reflect at all upon the Subſcribers generally, as thou quotes them; but upon the Contriver or Drawer up of it, who ever it was that I feared it was not well meant in him or them, and I am ſtill of the ſame mind, and it's my deſire, and the deſire of us all that every Friend may keep in a ſence of the meaſure of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God in their own particulars, that in that they may feel their Unity one with another, and with one anothers Teſtimonies. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ancient Doctrine Preached among us from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and thoſe that keeps in this ſence feels what flows from the Univerſal Spirit of Truth, and receives it in their own meaſure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from a ſenſible ſatisfaction in themſelves, and not from an Implicit Subjection or blind obedience, as thou enviouſly intimates we aim to ſet up; and if it ſhould come to paſs, that a thing ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared from the motion of the Spirit of God, and that ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Friend doth not preſently have that ſenſible ſatisfaction in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf concerning the matter, what then? do you think that the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Spirit in himſelf will ſtir him up to oppoſe it, and War againſt it, ſurely no; but it will teach him to wait in quietneſs upon God who is the opener of the underſtanding, and doth by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit bring his People to the Unity of the Faith, but that ſort of men, whoſe Quarrel thou haſt ſo much eſpouſed, are a ſort of heady un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly Oppoſers of themſelves, fierce deſpiſers, who malignes the proſperity of the Truth, and thoſe that labour in it, aſperſing both them and their Labours with Nick-names and reproachful Speeches, and bloody and murderous Inſinuations and Suggeſtions: And muſt all this be fathered upon the Spirit of God! Oh horrible darkneſs! well may it be ſaid night is upon you, and blindneſs is happened to you.

               </note> Did the Spirit of God in the beginning teach ſuch an induſtrious improving of failings and weakneſſes; ſuch a raking for evil things, ſuch heaping up Accuſations, ſuch rendring of them that fear God ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious both to reproach and ſufferings. Nay, nay <hi>Thomas,</hi> this is the Spirit of the World entred in another appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which had thou and you been faithful to the real Gift and Grace of God, it had preſerved you from it.</p>
            <p>Now as concerning that diſingenious manner of reflecting, which thou frequently uſes, I hope thou wilt meet with a ſufficient Reproof in thy ſelf for it, and therefore ſhall not ſay much, only to put thee in mind, to ſee if thou would'ſt be ſo dealt by: As where thou ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes our meanings, and then Comments upon thy own ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as that <hi>G.

to beſtow much more pains about this matter, the foundation upon which it was built, being diſcovered to be Enmity and Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, the Structure cannot ſtand. In the mean time, glad ſhould I be that thou, or ſome of you, may ſink down into Coolneſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member whence you are fallen and falling, and what a Spirit is entred you that is refreſh'd at any thing; that is a grief to the Innocent People of God, and are fretting and grieving at that which is our greateſt Joy and Comfort, in which many among you ſometime did partake with us, I ſay, when ye ſee what Spirit this is that hath prevailed upon you, it will make you wiſh you had not wandered from the Flock, nor from the Shepherds Tents, though it may be when it may be too late. Therefore you that have time, prize it, the Lord's Day is come, and His Judgments haſtens, and he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide the Controverſie.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>S.

               <hi>THomas Criſp</hi> having once before appeared in Print, with a like evil deſign of oppoſing the Teſtimony of Friends, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, to the order and practice now obſerved among the Faithful, and having therein curtailed a Teſtimony of my dear Father <hi>Iſaac Penington,</hi> and publiſhed that as <hi>Edward Burroughs</hi> his Viſion, which is queſtioned whether he ever wrote, as well as that he confeſſed he had never ſeen or read that Book of my Fathers, out of which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to render him to the World as inconſiſtent with Friends now, but taken it from the credit of another, no leſs diſingenious than himſelf; I ſay, he having been thus groſs, it had better become him to have taken ſhame to himſelf for his former headineſs, partiality, raſh and confuſed work, than to have put forth another Pamphlet, reflecting upon ſuch on whom the care of the Churches is laid, as <hi>Babel Builders</hi>; eſpecially ſeeing his unfairneſs and unworthineſs was both privately repreſented to him, and he publiquely required, to make good; Firſt, <hi>That ever</hi> Edward Burrough <hi>wrote that or any ſuch Paper, as he took upon truſt as his Viſion.</hi> Or, Secondly, <hi>That that cited by him was</hi> Edward Burroughs<hi>'s entire Paper.</hi> But that he inſtead thereof ſhould take no notice of theſe reaſonable demands, as if they were not material, or he not bound to make good what he had ſaid and declared to the World, but continue in his wicked work of ſmiting God's Servants and Meſſengers, and traducing their Writings, greatly detects the meanneſs of the man's Spirit, and the little regard he hath to deal juſtly and equally with thoſe he oppoſeth. Yet he can have the face to bring up the names of <hi>E. B.</hi> and <hi>J. P.</hi> again, with the ſame tendency as before, <hi>viz.</hi> to render their ſence different from their Brethrens preſent practice, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly their <hi>directing to the Light in our own Hearts or Conſciences,</hi> inconſiſtent with the <hi>unlimited power,</hi> which he ſaith is given to <hi>Men and Women Meetings,</hi> as may be ſeen, <hi>p.</hi> 9, and 12. of his Book ſtiled, <hi>Babels Builders unmasking themſelves,</hi> &amp;c. which if by <hi>E. B.</hi> and <hi>J. P.</hi> he means <hi>Edward Burroughs</hi> and <hi>Iſaac Penington,</hi> let me ſay, is no leſs than a manifeſt Perverſion of their Writings; as well as that I demand of him to prove, how it can be deducible therefrom, and that the rather for that I my ſelf know, that my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath delivered to the contrary both by word and writing, and never ſaw or heard any thing contradictory thereto come from him:
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43946:7"/>
And I have alſo a Manuſcript of <hi>Edward Burroughs</hi> by me, written in the Ninth Year of the publication of Truth in <hi>London</hi>; wherein, after he hath given account of the firſt Preaching of the Goſpel in that City, he declares that the Mens M<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eting there was ſet up <hi>in the Name, Power and Wiſdom of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and that he had given them Power and Authority ſo to do:</hi> And afterwards ſpeaking of the Womens Meeting, ſaith, <hi>It was in the ſame manner or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, in the Authority of Chriſt to be continued,</hi> for ſuch and ſuch ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices; and concludes. <hi>Theſe things was I moved of the Lord to write forth, in the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for the Service of Truth; and in the ſame Name, Power and Authority,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>do I enjoyn the free and perfect obſervation of the things herein ſignified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in as much as it is clear, that neither of them did oppoſe a man's being guided by the Light, to his concurring in practice, with that good order and government now Eſtabliſh'd in the Church of Chriſt, but acknowledged the benefit and neceſſity thereof, (ſo that as by <hi>the Spirit none can call Jeſus accurſed,</hi> ſo none that is really led by the Light, can under pretence of being directed thereto, <hi>As the only Guide and Leader,</hi> call that accurſed, or the <hi>Order and Edicts of Men,</hi> which the ſame Light, Grace and Truth, that convinced at the beginning, brings forth in the Church, whether immediately or mediately through Inſtruments) will not this man then be found a falſe accuſer in the day of the Lord, that would inſinuate the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary? Let him conſider it, and have a care, leſt by his continual ſmiting againſt God's Servants, and miſ-repreſenting them, he be at length given up to a Reprobate mind: for is it not groſly wicked thus elaborately to endeavour to render men otherwiſe than they are in God's ſight, and take thoſe indirect means to prove it as he did by my Father, as never to read his Book, and ſee whether it were ſo or no, but only take it upon truſt from his Adverſary, and upon his ſole Authority commit it to the Preſs: and then inſtead of reclaiming it, go on in a like evil work? Surely, as a man, I would have wiped off ſuch a blemiſh before I came in Print again on ſuch an occaſion: but with regret let me ſay it, I have ſeen too many hardned through the deceitfulneſs of ſin, and their very innocent Image loſt, when prejudice and envy hath filled them againſt the Lord's People, and fallen ſhort of what is civil, generous and noble among men, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come too much like the brute Beaſt that periſheth; which indeed is not pleaſant to behold, though a juſt reward upon ſuch as would lay God's Heritage waſt.</p>
