            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE <hi>Art of Glass,</hi> being one of the Most Noble and Curious of all other Arts, and the Wonderfulness of it, both in the Simplicity of the Matter, whereof it is made, and in the Formation of it; as also the Various Colours it is capable of receiving, appearing so Curious and Entertaining, chiefly engaged my Thoughts in the Study of its Principles, and to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate into the most hidden Secrets of it.</p>
            <p>The Knowledge I had acquired in the Secrets of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, both by Speculations, and repeated Experiments, Excited me to a more particular Enquiry of whatever might be extraordinary in it, that I might Impart it to the Publick.</p>
            <p>Most People are of Opinion, That the Ancient Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Tinging Glass, (with those fine and rich Colours, whereof there are still some Remains to be seen in Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Churches) is at present quite lost. It is true indeed, it is lost Publickly, since those who publickly profess the <hi>Art of Making Glass,</hi> know nothing of it: But to those who set themselves throughly to study the true Principles of whatever they undertake, it is not difficult to Retrieve
<pb facs="tcp:55296:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
lost Arts, and Revive them in their Ancient Splendour and Perfection.</p>
            <p>I shall therefore here endeavour to Revive, and make Publick, this supposedly lost Secret, of giving all those Curious and Rich Colours to <hi>Glass,</hi> which the Ancients did, by shewing whatever has been performed, that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary and curious in this <hi>Science,</hi> which I have traced and recovered from the obscure Tracts of Ancient <hi>Authors,</hi> and confirmed by my own Experiments; and also augmented what was delivered by them, in Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of several rare and precious Matters, that cannot but appear very extraordinary.</p>
            <p>This Age has been very happy for the Restauration of <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences,</hi> of which that late Excellent Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of State, Monsieur <hi>Colbert</hi> Superintendant, and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyor-General of the Buildings, Arts, and Manufactures of <hi>France,</hi> has been an Assiduous Reviver and Encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: They seem at present to be arrived at so high a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Perfection, that there is not one but has surpassed whatever was done by the <hi>Ancients</hi>; and those under his Inspection, particularly merit on that account a preference to any others. That of <hi>Glass,</hi> whereof we are at present to treat, has not been the last that has signalized it self, having already shewn Wonders in the extraordinary large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>Coach-glasses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have divided this Work into <hi>Twelve Books,</hi> which contain so many different Heads, tho' derived from the same Principles. If we were to follow the ordinary Custom of most <hi>Authors,</hi> we should Epitomize in the <hi>Preface,</hi> the <hi>Contents</hi> of those <hi>Twelve Books</hi>: But that seems to us a needless Task, since the <hi>Reader</hi> may please to peruse an <hi>Index,</hi> which we have for that purpose annexed to the End of this Volume, which will be sufficient for the <hi>Reader</hi>'s Satisfaction therein.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:55296:5"/>Our Design being not to trouble the <hi>Reader</hi> with a long <hi>Preface,</hi> we have resolved only to touch very lightly of the Matters contained in the Book, and only to hint of some things that are omitted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Glass</hi> has something in it so beautiful to the Sight, and its Transparency is so agreeable, that it is no wonder we find it by several, and even in the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> it self, compared not only to <hi>Gold,</hi> the most perfect of all Metals, but also to things far more high and Spiritual. They are <hi>Mysteries</hi> of deeper Consequences, than at first sight we imagine, since by them we are informed, that Vitrification gives a better Being, or Nobler Nature. This requires the attentive Thoughts of <hi>Philosophers,</hi> not only in the <hi>Nature of Metals,</hi> where it is easily seen; but also in other things, where Sense and Experience te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie the Truth of it.</p>
            <p>We have asserted in our <hi>Book,</hi> that <hi>Glass</hi> is a perfect Metal, since it will bear the utmost force of Fire as well as <hi>Gold</hi>: And that there is but one sort of Fire, more Puissant than the Vulgar, that can consume it: But here we will take notice, that there are two Ways to make <hi>Glass,</hi> and that it may be made more or less fixed. That the more fixed, which is the least beautiful and the least transparent, resists every thing; no Preparation of <hi>Mercury,</hi> nor any Species of <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> can Dissolve it, nor the most sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>le <hi>Poisons,</hi> or highest <hi>Corrosives,</hi> arrive any further than to break it. The less fixed, on the contrary, which is the most clear and transparent, as that of <hi>Venice,</hi> is less capable of Resistance, being composed of a more purified Salt: Thus it will Dissolve in the Earth, or in cold and moist Places, if there be more Salt in it proportionably <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>han Sand, by a Separation natural to those two sorts of Matter: And <hi>Poisons</hi> Extracted out of <hi>Minerals</hi> will Dissolve it, by reason of their great cold.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:55296:6"/>We shan't repeat here the Virtues <hi>Glass</hi> is capable of acquiring, (whereof we make mention in several places) by the <hi>Grand Elixir of the Philosophers,</hi> (which makes it Malleable, and Converts <hi>Crystal</hi> into <hi>Precious Stones</hi>) as also by several other ways. We'll only add, That there are several other less and particular Secrets, by which it may be made soft and fusil like Wax, and afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to its former hardness in Water; but these are lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Curiosities that serve to no purpose.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Glass</hi> may receive either within or without any sort of <hi>Metallick Colours,</hi> which makes it very proper for Painting. Those which we shall teach to Extract from <hi>Metals,</hi> and shew in this <hi>Book</hi> for the tinging of <hi>Glass,</hi> give it a Lustre equal to <hi>Precious Stones,</hi> and set it off with an unspeakable Beauty.</p>
            <p>As we have given you the ordinary Preparations of all sorts of <hi>Metals, Crystal, Glass, Rochetta, Soda, Tartar, Manganese, Salt, Sulphur, Vitriol, Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortis</hi> and <hi>Regis, Pastes, Enamels, Pearls,</hi> and other things contained in this Work: So we can safely say, we have given you more of them than are common, and some which have never been publick; which we have all along taken particular care to do, to oblige the Curious in this Art, who will apprehend it better by reading the <hi>Book</hi> it self, than we can tell them in the <hi>Preface.</hi> But more particularly to shew our Ingenuous and Vnprejudiced Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality in this Affair, and how little envy we have to the Students and Practisers of this Art, we discover to them such extraordinary and precious Receipts in it, as would have been Industriously concealed by any other Hand, because they point out the Paths to Persons Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant and Illuminated in these <hi>Studies,</hi> even to their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Secrets, and most hidden Recesses.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:55296:6"/>By what we treat of in this <hi>Book</hi> upon this Subject, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>IT has not been without Reason, that several Learned Persons have compared Man to a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crocosm, or Little World, since he contains in himself all the Excellencies of the Greater; and that God, having created him after his own Image, has given him an Absolute Dominion over all Creatures in this World: Not only over Animals and Vegetables, and those other visible mixt Bodies, among which we are immediately conversant; but also over Metals, Minerals, Semiminerals, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Stones, Pearls, Corals, and whatever Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55296:9"/>
are hid in the Bowels of the Earth, or Bottom of the Seas; that he might make use of them for his own Pleasure, and that by the Understanding God has given him, he might know their Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to make them usefull for his particular Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions.</p>
               <p>The Power of Nature is limited in all her Effects, and Man alone can augment and enlarge by Art, the Virtues and Powers which she has produced, by separating the Pure from the Impure, that which is more Subtil and Spiritual, from the more Gross and Earthy; which Nature her self cannot do, by reason she has no Tools nor Instruments proper for such Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations; especially of those Impurities, which by proceeding from the Corruptions of the Matrixes, where all her Generations are made, perpetually mix themselves with all her Productions: Besides that the Universal Seed (or Spirit) of the World, which contains in it self the three Principles and four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whereof every thing in Nature is compos'd and nourish'd, is it self not free from Impurity; for in making its Circulations from Heaven to Earth, and from thence again to Heaven, where it is impregnated with all the Virtues of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellations and Planets, it returns again, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends even to the Center of the Earth, there to be impregnated with a Body and Salt, and acquire the utmost Elementary Perfection; whence the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral Fire forcing it to repass to the Surface, and thence into the Globe of Water and Air, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving produced, in its passage, in all the Elements, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> this Seed or Soul of the World becomes invested with Impurities, whereof the general or universal Spirit is tainted, so that the Pure and Impure ascend
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55296:9"/>
and descend together in Confusion; insomuch, that only the Industry of Man can separate them, by ejecting the unprofitable excrementitious Parts, and separating and purifying its Principles, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uniting them, to make a Compound of a greater Virtue; so that of that Compound you may make a Species capable of producing its <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Without doubt the Author has an eye in this Expression to the Multiplication of Gold.</hi>
                  </note> like: For the Nature of one Mixt or Compound, cannot produce or be chang'd into a Mixt of a different Nature; We must always sow Wheat to have a Crop of Wheat.</p>
               <p>Hence it is that so many great Philosophers have told us, That Man, by the means of Art, might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin where Nature left off, by purifying its Matters, and reducing them to their first Principles, and thence raising them to the utmost degree of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; whether the End be to prolong Man's Life, or curing his greatest and most inveterate Diseases, as also of other Animals; or for Metals, Minerals, Pretious Stones, Plants, and other Vegetables. Now such Separation and Purification of Substances is not impossible, as long as you destroy not entirely the Subjects: But it must be perform'd by some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that specifically agrees with their own respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Natures; then (by it) you may make a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Reduction of their Substances, wherewith by means of Art, Man may perform all those things I have now mention'd, as to cure the most inveterate Diseases, convert what is imperfect into the most perfect; and it is hereby that you have display'd, that absolute Dominion which God has given him over all the Creatures.</p>
               <p>It is not my present Design to enter into the depth of the Mysteries of this sublime Science, which I
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55296:10"/>
leave to those true <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Adepti.</hi>
                  </note> Philosophers, who are the only Creatures to whom God has reveal'd them, and whereof all other Men, like my self, are unworthy: but only to shew by sensible Demonstration, That Man, in many things, is capable of imitating Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by the Assistance of Art; and of performing several things by his Industry, and the Work of his hands, which look more like Miracles, than the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Art. Those which make the Subject of the following Discourse, would be no less surprizing, if they were less common; but from the time our Eyes become accustom'd by constant use to any Object, the Esteem of it begins to be lessen'd, and fall; Witness Nature her self, whose Annual Renovation, tho' we are accustom'd to it, ought to be a perpetual Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Admiration.</p>
               <p>Of all the Works of Art, that of Glass is not the least considerable, whether it be Natural or Artificial; it melts in the Fire without consuming, and is therein perfected or made fine like Gold, which is a perfect Metal, and there leaves behind it its Dross, becoming purified and whitened, which renders it more proper for making Dishes, Glasses, and other Vessels for Man's use, than any other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, or Matter whatsoever. Nay, I may yet go far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and say, That Glass not only purifies it self in the Fire, but also assists to purifie and melt all other Metals, and render them more plyable and malleable, and so more easie to work upon to the ends they are design'd for.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Spagyrick Art,</hi> in Physick, in Chymistry, it is impossible to be without Vessels of Glass, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Sublimations, Distillations, or Putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Digestions, Circulations, or other Operations to which they are necessary for several Reasons; one
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55296:10"/>
whereof is, That all the gradual Alterations, of the Matter therein contain'd, and what is done in it on the Fire, are visible to the eye; and another, That those Matters can neither be imbib'd by the Vessel, nor transpire thro' its Pores, nor it communicate any ill Scent or Taste, which might be noxious to the Health, if the Matter be prepar'd for Medicine: Moreover the Philosophers make use of no other Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels for their curious Operations, whether it be to extract the Philosophick <hi>Mercury,</hi> or purifie it, or for the Decoction of their Grand <hi>Elixir</hi> and <hi>Pana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caea's,</hi> which they cannot perform without Glass; for otherwise they would labour in the dark, and could never well regulate their Operations: Besides the Volatility of their Spirits, which they must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, is of so subtile and quick Penetration, that no other Vessels could hold them.</p>
               <p>Churches, Palaces, Castles, and Particular Houses, owe their chiefest Ornaments as well as Convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, to Glass; for that transparent Substance guards them within from too great Heat and Cold, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hindring the Intromission of the Light. Looking-Glasses, and other great Plates of Glasses are as so many surprizing Objects to our Eyes, representing so distinctly and naturally all even from the least to the greatest Actions of the Objects before them; whereby also one may always keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in a neat and agreeable dress. Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not one in a Thousand of those who have them, ever reflect on the Admirableness of the Work, which is beyond doubt, one of the chiefest, and most perfect Pieces of Art, and than which Man can make nothing more wonderful.</p>
               <p>Moreover, <hi>China-Ware</hi> for adorning Capboards and Tables, Dishes, divers sorts of Glasses, and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, and a thousand other Curiosities, of all sort; of Colours, which serve both for Pleasure and Use,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55296:11"/>
and employ the Poor all over the World; are they not well worthy of Admiration?</p>
               <p>But if we consider the Painting and Representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Glasses of Churches, we must at the same time admire, that the Colours which we extract from Metals for that End, can be so very lively, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble so many pretious Stones. If any of this Glass be cast into a Furnace, you may see what a vast number of Colours it is susceptible of, even beyond Comparison.</p>

The Name of <hi>Glass,</hi> which the <hi>French, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and <hi>English</hi> have given it, seems to be taken from its resembling or approaching somewhat in its Colour to <note n="†" place="bottom">

               <p>
                  <hi>Monzerus</hi> tells us; That when Looking-Glass was first invented, they were sold very dear, as if they had been made of some pretious Matter, and also by reason People took so much Pleasure in seeing themselves so lively pictured. To this we may add, That it is not above 200 Years since they came first to be in use, and that the way of making them was found out by a certain Person, who, melting some Glass in a Crucible, chanc'd to spill it on the ground,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55296:11"/>
where it running under a great Square Tile, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Floor was pav'd, oblig'd the Workman to take it up, where he found it in Form of a Looking-Glass-Plate, (which could not have been so form'd by the ordinary way of blowing), which began to employ his Thoughts all that Night, and thence he conceived, That Glass might be run into Plates like Metal, which he began to experiment from that day forward; and so he found out the way to those Consequences which meer Chance was the first occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of; as it had been also before of the very Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whereof this Metal is compos'd, as we shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after shew.</p>
               <p>The use of Glass is so Antient, that it is difficult to assign the time of its first Invention: <hi>Pliny</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, that it was in the City of <hi>Sidon</hi> that the first Vessels of Glass were made, as may be seen in the 26<hi>th Chap.</hi> of his 36<hi>th</hi> Book.</p>
               <p>Others affirm its Origin must be as antient as Bricks, by reason one can scarce make the one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other; this is the reason that has made some assert that this Art was known at the time of the Building of <hi>Babel,</hi> that being made of Brick, and that way of Building continu'd in <hi>Egypt,</hi> since we read, it was the sole employ of the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> in their Captivity to make them. This might be strengthen'd by a convincing Proof out of the Bible, whereof <hi>Moses</hi> was the first Author, where you read of Glass, which would not have been mention'd if it had not been in use in those Days.</p>
               <p>The Passages we find of St. <hi>Iohn</hi> in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> seem to put a very high esteem on Glass; for in speaking of the Throne of God, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 6. he says, <hi>And before the Throne there was a Sea of Glass like unto Crystal.</hi> And speaking of the Heavenly City, whereof he gives the Description <hi>Chap.</hi> 20<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and the City was of pure Gold, like unto clear Glass.</hi> and at the 21. <hi>verse, And the twelve Gates were twelve Pearls, every Gate was of one Pearl, and the street of the City was pure Gold, as it were transparent Glass.</hi> That is to say, a Glass of Gold, or more properly, Gold Vitrifi'd, which is that <hi>Electrum</hi> of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of St. <hi>Ierome</hi> makes mention. I may strengthen it yet further, by a passage out of <hi>Iob, Chap.</hi> 28. <hi>ver.</hi> 17. where speaking of the Wisdom of God, he says, <hi>The Gold and Crystal cannot equal it.</hi> Which does not only shew us the Antiquity of Glass, but also in what esteem it was had in those days, being always equall'd to Gold. This last passage is also Cited in a Translation of St. <hi>Ierome,</hi> and in several other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, among whom, some have chang'd the word of Gold and Glass, to that of a <hi>Stone more precious than Gold.</hi> Others to a <hi>Carbuncle, or some other precious Stone.</hi> But, (say they,) all these names are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of only one and the same Stone, which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients believed gave Light by Night, and which is no where to be found. This last Opinion is very Mysterious, and that one only Stone, according to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> ought to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of the Divine Union with our Nature, by the Mystery of the Incarnation of the Word.</p>
               <p>The great <hi>Hermes,</hi> the Father of the Philosophers, call'd that Stone, the Image of the Invisible God, which <hi>Moses</hi> (also) shut up in the Ark of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and which was call'd the Glory of God, shining in the Night like a burning Fire, or like a bright and and shining Star which gave light by Day, as you may see in <hi>Numbers.</hi> This it was, which these Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors meant and understood, but which no others can comprehend, unless it be the true Philosophers. We design to treat more largely thereof in our next Work, Entituled, <hi>The Mystical Characters of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty unveil'd and laid open,</hi> wherein we will make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55296:12"/>
that of those Characters were Compos'd the Two Tables of the Law, which were afterwards put into the Ark, and which are the two Pretious Stones which serve at present for Guides to the wise among the Philosophers, as they did heretofore for Figures to the Antients.</p>
               <p>We might fetch the Origin of Glass from <hi>Tubal-Cain,</hi> the Son of <hi>Lamech</hi>; for he being the first Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist that found out the way of melting Metals, and the uses of Iron and Brass, whereof he forg'd Arms for War, as is noted in the 4<hi>th. Chap.</hi> of <hi>Gen.</hi> it is not improbable, but that he might be the first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventor of Glass, because one can scarce avoid redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Calcin'd Metals into Glass, especially when the Fire is more than ordinarily violent, and the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter remains longer in it than it ought. It was this which made <hi>Ferrandus Imperatus,</hi> say, that the Origin of Glass came from Fire, or from its Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration alone in those Furnaces where Fire was preserv'd in its full force. We own Fire to be the first Agent both of Nature and Art; but with this distinction, that that of Nature vivifies or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livens, and that of Art resolves and destroys, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when it is too vehement: But he who knows how to direct and manage it, may make good use of it for the Separation and Perfection of the Matters wherein he works; whence it very often happens that several Persons seek that which they cannot find, and find that which they did not seek; wherefore we may truly say, that most part of our best Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Secrets, have been found out by meer chance, and as it were hazard of Art.</p>
               <p>The great <hi>Hermes</hi> was not ignorant of the Art of making Glass, since he taught the Knowledge of it to the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Chymists, but not that of the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation of Metals, tho' he possess'd it, as <hi>Kircher</hi> tells in his <hi>Oedipus</hi>; That since that time, that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55296:13"/>
have always profess'd this Art, in which they were so Expert, that <hi>Flavius Vopiscus</hi> speaking of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> tells us, it was very Rich, and Fruitful in Corn, and that no one is there idle, one part of the Poor making Glass, and the other Paper.</p>
               <p>We have another Evidence of the Antiquity of Glass, in the 4<hi>th</hi> Book of <hi>Lucretius:</hi> But the most part of Historians attribute the Invention of it to the Alchymists, who by endeavouring to counterfeit Pretious Stones, found out this Secret. It is to these great Men, indeed, we are oblig'd for almost all our Modern Knowledge of the most curious Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of Nature, they having unveil'd her most hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Mysteries. The Profession of an Alchymist in those Days, was not Vilifi'd as it is now, it being esteem'd very Honourable, Kings themselves exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it. We shall discourse thereof in the Work we have promis'd, and whence the word <hi>Chymistry</hi> is deriv'd, where we will prove its Antiquity by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral passages out of the Holy Scripture. But we will here add, that the Chymists of this present Age are very far remov'd, both in Knowledge and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity from those Antient ones, who never practis'd those base Sophistications, and a thousand other Tricks of that Nature, which the Modern do; which is the reason that this Art, so Noble and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime in its Principles, is now a-days so much Vilifi'd, that to have the name of a Chymist, (of that sort,) is enough to render a Man detestable among honest Men. Also most part of those who set up for that Profession, are nothing but a sort of Quack Collectors of Recipe's, with which, under the false appearances of Fixation, of Augmentation of Gold and Silver, which they call <hi>Powders of Projection,</hi> &amp;c. and which they pretend to do with common <hi>Mercury,</hi> the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Metals, Minerals, Salts, Powders, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ingredients, Heterogeneous to the principal
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55296:13"/>
Matters, with these, I say, they abuse Credulous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons by their fair words often to their Ruine. It is not with common gross Matters that Philosophers work, nor can they bring any thing to Perfection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have converted their Matters into Fluid, Volatile, and Spiritual Substances, such as they were before their Coagulations; not by the means of <hi>Aquae Fortes</hi> and Corrosives, which the Antients knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of; but by means of the same Liquors that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender'd and nourish'd them, which is as it were their Parent, Homogeneous to them, and that Water of Life of the Philosophers, or rather the Key of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, without which, you'll always work in vain. That which seems to the Eyes of the Credulous to be Augmentation, will never undergo the true Proofs of Silver and Gold; if it should chance to undergo some one tryal; you may be sure the second will make all the hopes of the pretended profit vanish in Smoak, and on the contrary, make you sensible of considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble loss, both by the waste of the Matters, and the Charges expended on the way of managing them. Thus those who have so little Sense as to engage in these Matters, may one Day find themselves drawn in to their loss.</p>
               <p>But let us return to the Origin of Glass; the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Essays of <hi>the Wonders of Nature,</hi> tells us, That the <hi>Limon</hi> of <hi>Lac Cendevia,</hi> which is found at the Foot of <hi>Mount-Carmel,</hi> was the first Matter wherewith Glass was made. That some Mariners being about to make a Trevet for a Kettle, went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shore in a place where they found this <hi>Lac,</hi> that they took some of the Sand, and mix'd it with <hi>Nitre,</hi> wherewith their Ship was laden, and that making a Fire under the Kettle, they saw a Noble Stream as it were of running Crystal, or melted Jewels, whence they learn'd to make Glass of those two Matters, since which time, (says he,) they have also mixed
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55296:14"/>
Load-Stone, seeing that will attract Glass as well as Iron; thence following they made use of certain fine Stones, and also of Sand, as the <hi>Indians</hi> also did of Crystal; but that in his time they made use of a Glassy Substance, extracted from an Herb, call'd <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> wherewith they mixed Sand to fix it. <hi>Pliny</hi> tells us something like this, in his 5<hi>th</hi> Book, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. where he also asserts, that we were indebted to Chance for the first Invention of Glass, which was on the Banks of the River <hi>Belus</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> where certain Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants being drove a-shore in a Storm, were obliged for sometime to stay and make Fires and to dress their Provisions; that the place abounding with a certain Herb call'd <hi>Kali,</hi> which, by the great Fires they made, being reduc'd into Ashes full of Salt, and joyn'd with Sand and Stones proper for making Glass, which are Natural and plenty thereabouts, run down into a sort of melted Glass: Which shew'd them not only the manner of making Glass; but also Crystal, and several other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ine things, which had not been found out without the Invention of Glass; the use where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is so necessary to pass away Life with Pleasure and Satisfaction, that Divine Providence has taken pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar care that no place on Earth should want Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als to make it, all being stock'd with them in such a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, that they seem inexhaustible. Which once made a certain Artist pleasantly conclude, That the Art of Glass would last throughout all Ages; for the general Conflagration in reducing the Earth into Ashes, by reason of the vast quantities of Salts that are mixed with it, would at last vitrifie the whole Mass into a lasting Monument of the Art. It is true, the end of the World, according to the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, is to arrive by Fire, not by that material Fire we use in our Chimneys; but by that which we call Elementary and Central, whereof God will only augment the heat, which will so dry up and parch
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55296:14"/>
the Earth, and exhaust all its humidity, that it shall not only be Calcin'd, but chang'd into a better Nature; afterwards to be inhabited by a new World of a Spiritual, Incorruptible and Glorious Nature, no more to be subjected to any change. What the two Authors we have just cited tell us, concerning the Origin of Glass, is far better clear'd, and more particulariz'd by <hi>Iosephus,</hi> in the 9<hi>th Chap.</hi> of his 2<hi>d</hi> Book <hi>of the Wars of the Iews,</hi> wherein he acquaints us with several surprizing things concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sand for making Glass, whereof we have been speaking. He takes notice that the River <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> arises out of <hi>Mount-Carmel,</hi> and passes between <hi>Ptolemais</hi> and <hi>Tyrus</hi>; that it is not above 2 Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs from <hi>Ptolemais</hi> that near this River is the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre and Statue of <hi>Bel</hi> or <hi>Belus,</hi> Father of <hi>Ninus,</hi> first King of the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> whom the <hi>Babylonians</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship'd for a long time, and Sacrific'd to, by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Ninus,</hi> who was the first Author of the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Priesthood of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> according to <hi>Eusebius,</hi> lib. 1. and <hi>Isidore,</hi> lib. 8. That that Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of <hi>Belus,</hi> whom the Pagans call'd <hi>Iupiter,</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most 100 Cubits high, (which is very remarkable,) and that in that place there is a Valley almost round, full of a clear Sand very fit for making Glass: And if the Ships which come thither for their Lading, chance to empty the place, it is immediately fill'd again, by the Winds driving it down from the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipices of the Mountains which environ the Valley round; insomuch, that having for many Ages past, made use of this Sand, it still always remains in the same abundance. He also tells us in the same Book, <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. that this Sand has a strange Nature above any other, which is, that it will change any Metal into Glass that is thrown in among it; and that which is yet more strange, that all the pieces of Glass made of this Sand, and cast again upon it,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55296:15"/>
are immediately converted into Sand again: That there is also found among this Sand a Pretious Stone about the bigness of an Acorn, very fine and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tacitus</hi> in the 5<hi>th</hi> Book of his Annals, makes also men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this River <hi>Belus,</hi> telling us it enters into the Sea of <hi>Iudea,</hi> at the Mouth whereof, the Sand that is gather'd up, by reason of the great quantity of <hi>Nitre</hi> contain'd in it, is easily chang'd into Glass in the Furnaces. And altho' the Shore is but small, that the Sand is notwithstanding inexhaustible. <hi>Strabo</hi> tells us the same thing in his 12<hi>th</hi> Book, and <hi>Pliny</hi> in his 6<hi>th,</hi> and also <hi>Agricola</hi> in his Treatise of <hi>Fossils:</hi> And one may say, that generally all Authors, who have spoke of Glass, have made mention of the place where this Sand is gotten, whereof Glass is made without any other mixture, wherein the Effects of Nature are to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, in affording us so fine and pretious a Metal in so base and common Matter. This ought to be an example to the Curious, and teach them, that those who seek for the prime Agent of Nature only in rare and pretious Matters, may be grosly mistaken, seeing it may often be found in the most Simple and Common; and often even in those things we tread under foot: So true it is, that Wise Nature, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the infinite Goodness of God, has so ordain'd the Business, that the Poor as well as the Rich, may partake of the most pretious and valuable Treasures, and as easily arrive to that Sovereign, Universal Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, to cure all Diseases; otherwise God could not be said to have dispens'd his Benefits to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and his Word, which is infallible, would not be true, when he says, <hi>That he is no respecter of Persons, but that every one who loves and fears him, shall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by him.</hi> Which shews us, that it is his Will to be known by all Men, and that all those who live in his Laws, may hope to be possess'd of this hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55296:15"/>
Treasure, to employ the fruits of it to his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Glory, which are the true Sentiments all good Christians ought to have; otherwise they ought never to hope for that Divine Treasure, which God only manifests to his Elect.</p>
               <p>Several Authors have written, and among the rest <hi>Pliny, Cassius,</hi> and <hi>Isidorus,</hi> That in the time of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Tiberius,</hi> who reigned in the time of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, a certain Person, but Anonymous, an Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect by his Profession, having by an admirable Piece of Skill, set upright again in the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> a great Portico that lean'd to one side, and made the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion firm and immoveable: <hi>Tiberius</hi> paid him, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd him the City, forbidding him to return. In the mean time this Person had found out the means to make Glass malleable, and came again to <hi>Rome,</hi> and presented one of these Glasses to the Emperour, who, being angry with him for returning without his Leave, flung the Glass against the ground, which only bruised: That this Workman taking it up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, immediately mended it with a Hammer upon a little Anvil he had brought on purpose, expecting for it the Emperour's Pardon; but it happen'd quite contrary; for that Prince asking him, if there were any other that knew the Secret, he answering no, the Emperour immediately caused his Head to be cut off on the spot, for fear the Knowledge of this Secret, should come to be propagated to Posterity, and that Gold on that account should come to be no more valu'd than Dirt, and consequently all other Metals lose their Esteem and Value. In short, Glass would be more valuable than Gold, if it were malle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, by reason of its Transparency.</p>
               <p>Our Age, fruitful in great Men, has had no less Advantage in the Reign of the late King <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Iust,</hi> than that of <hi>Tiberius</hi>; since we are assur'd, That a certain Learned Man having found out the same Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret

               <p>THis way of making <hi>Ferretto</hi> is not common, nor much known; wherefore we will here teach it for Satisfaction of the Curious. It is of a very wonderful use, not only for Tinging Glass, but for several Chymical Operations, wherein we know the use of it, which is very surprizing, if a second and further Preparation be made of it, whereof we shall here make no mention, it being foreign to our Subject; but take that which serves for Tinging Glass as follows.</p>
               <p>Take very fine Steel, for in the Perfection of that consists all the Excellency of the Work; make it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thin Plates, or file it: also do the same<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or Brass, <hi>viz.</hi> make that also into thin Plates, or take the Filings of it, one part to two of the Steel; put them into a Crucible <hi>stratum super stratum,</hi> lute them, and put it on a gentle Fire for Eight Hours, then take it out, and melt the whole in a Wind-Furnace, then cast it in a Lingot, or in lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Plates, and the business is done.</p>
               <p>To make use of this in Glass, you must calcine these Plates, then pound them, and searce them, and keep that Powder in a Pot close shut up for use.</p>

                  <hi>NEri</hi> and <hi>Merret</hi> give the Name of <hi>Ferretto</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> to the following Preparations, in this and the next Chapter; asserting that it communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates several very fine Colours to Glass. The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ways of Calcining Metals, causes different Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; which is known to the Experienc'd in this Art.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Ferretto</hi> we have taught in the precedent Chapters, be of vast use in Glass, and very ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable in Pastes, Enamels, and Glass of Lead, by reason of the great Resemblance it causes to Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Stones; this and the following are of no less use.</p>
               <p>Take thin Plates of Copper or Brass, cut them into pieces, and put them into a Crucible, in the Bottom of which you have laid a Bed of Sulphur pulveriz'd, then a Layer of Copper; then another of Sulphur, and then again of Copper: which you must thus continue <hi>stratum super stratum,</hi> till the Crucible is full. Then cover over the Crucible with another, or with a Tile, and lute it well, and dry it, and put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Furnace among hot Coals in a good brisk Fire for the space of two hours. Then take out the Crucible, let it cool, and you will find the Copper or Brass calcin'd, which will break and crumble between your fingers like dry earth, of a blackish Colour. You must pound it to a fine Powder, and searce it and keep it in a Vessel well closed for use.</p>

Then take out the Crucible and add to the Copper new Rows or Layers of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> strati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying it as before; then you put the Crucible in a Reverberatory Fire in the same place as before; which you must continue to do for six times succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively one after another, and then you will have a very Excellent <hi>Ferretto,</hi> which you beat to Powder, and it will tinge Glass of Extraordinary Beautiful Colours.</p>

               <p>THO' this second way of making <hi>Crocus Martis</hi> be very Easy, yet it ought to be Esteemed; since it tinges Glass of the true red Colour of Blood; it is prepared thus. Take filings of Iron, or, which is better, of Steel; mix them well in Earthen Pans with strong Vinegar, only sprinkling them so much that they may be throughly wet, spread them in Pans and set them in the Sun till they be dry, or if the Sun be hid by the Clouds set them in the open Air; then Powder them, and sprinkle them again with Vinegar, and dry them as before, then Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them again, and repeat this Process Eight times; at last grind and searce them well, and you will have a very fine Powder of the Colour of beaten brick, which keep in close Vessels for use.</p>

               <p>WE have shewn the way to make <hi>Crocus Martis</hi> for Colouring Glass, and now we will shew that of Copper, which is very near in nature to the other as we have remarked; And which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:55296:20"/>
in the same Acids and Corrosives. <hi>Venus</hi> as well as <hi>Mars</hi> (or Copper as well as Iron) gives us diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Colours, which proceed from different ways of preparing them, as we shall see in the following Chapters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Merret</hi> pretends that Brass gives us a finer blue than Copper, by reason of the <hi>Lapis Calaminaris</hi> which is mixt with it, and partly causes the Colour.</p>
               <p>Of all Metals Copper is only used (as Allay) to give malleability to Gold and Silver in Coin: It melts easily in an indifferent heat, but it is calcin'd into powder with difficulty. There are several ways of Calcining Copper, here follow five of them by help of fire. The first is of Copper alone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any addition; the second by the addition of <hi>Sulphur</hi>; the third by <hi>Vitriol</hi>; the fourth of Brass alone divers ways; the fifth by a preparation of the <hi>Vitriol</hi> of <hi>Venus.</hi> These preparations are the best, and of more value than those prepared by Spirits and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosives. All these different ways of Calcinations and Preparations of <hi>Venus,</hi> shall be explained in several Chapters of this Treatise, whither the curious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may have recourse.</p>
               <p>The little Plates or Leaves, whereof we are now to shew the preparation, are a sort of Copper or Brass exceeding thin, approaching the Colour of Gold, called Festoons. These Plates are made of this Colour by <hi>Lapis Calaminaris,</hi> which does not only Colour the Copper, but augments its weight; this Brass being well calcined tinges Glass of a Blue, and Sea-Green. The way to calcine it is this.</p>
               <p>To avoid the expence of buying new, you may make use of those leaves that have been already used and worked, they being good, and cut them with Scissers into little pieces, and put them into a
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:55296:21"/>
Crucible covered and luted, in the mouth of a Furnace to Calcine, and let them stand there for four days, at a Coal fire, so that the leaves may not melt: For then they would be unfit for this use. The four days being expired, the whole will be calcined, beat them on a Porphury Stone, and Searce them thro' a fine Sieve; and you will have a blackish powder, which you must spread on Tiles, and put it into the same Furnace for four days longer; then take it out and blow off the ashes that may be fallen on it; then reduce it again into Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, searceing it thro' a fine Sieve as before, and keep it for use.</p>
               <p>You may know when it is well Calcined, if the Glass rises and swells when you put it upon it, if it does not you must calcine other leaves, those being not Serviceable by reason they are burnt in the Calcination.</p>

               <p>ALtho' Copper be of the same nature as Brass, which serves to Colour Glass blue, yet there is some difference between them, for the latter will tinge it of several Colours, which proceeds from the <hi>Lapis Calaminaris,</hi> and some other mixtures in the preparation.</p>
               <p>To make this powder, Take what quantity you please of Copper in thin plates, put it into a great Crucible into the Furnace, till it be calcined, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out melting; then being cooled, reduce it into powder which will be very red, and searce it; whereof you may make divers uses as we shall shew hereafter.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXXIII. To make Copper thrice calcin'd for colouring Glass.</head>
               <p>THE same red Powder in the preceding Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter serves here. Take of that Powder and put it on Tiles, and calcine it again in the Furnace four days; it will become black, and coagulated into one Mass: Powder it and searce it, calcine it again 5 or 6 days in the same Furnace, and it will become grey without coagulating any more, or running into Lumps, and will be in a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on fit to be dissolv'd. Of this Powder which the <hi>Italians</hi> call <hi>Ramina di Trecotte,</hi> is made Sky-colour'd blue, the colour of <hi>Turcois,</hi> the green of <hi>Emerald,</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:55296:22"/>
and several other colours. It must not be calcined above thrice, for it would no longer Colour Glass. You may know if it be calcined well, by casting some of it in a Pot of boiling Glass; if it swells as we have said before, if not, you must set it yet Twenty Four hours longer in the Furnace, or rather begin a new Process.</p>

               <p>WOrkmen who seek ways to spare their pains, will find this way of Calcination less Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensive than the others, and almost of equal beauty: Take the Scales which the Brasiers make when they hammer Pans, Kettles, or other works of Brass, as being much cheaper than new Copper. To calcine these Scales there is no need of Stratification as we have shewn before in other Copper, which is troublesom; they need only be well washed from all foulness; and being well dry'd, put them into one or more Crucibles, and set them just into the Mouth of the Reverberatory-Furnace for the space of four days: Being at length cool'd, pound or grind them and fearce them. Then set that powder a second time in the same Furnace to reverberate during four days longer; and you will have little Balls of a black Colour, which you must pound and searce again, and then put them the third time into the Reverberatory; and after four other days re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to powder as before; thus it will be prepared with less Expence, and as good to colour Glass, which will be easy to see by making tryal on melted Glass: For if it makes it rise when you cast it on, it is right.</p>

               <p>Take thin Plates of the Reddest Copper which is the hardest sort, make it red-hot in a Crucible or otherwise, then extinguish it in a Lee of Urine, wherein common Salt has been dissolved; and reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate this process till the Copper become of the colour
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55296:23"/>
of Gold both within and without. After that you must cement those Plates with two parts of Sulphur, two parts of Salt-Petre, and one part of Vitriol cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin'd <hi>ad rubedinem,</hi> the whole reduc'd to powder, wherewith you must stratifie those Plates in a Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, pressing close each Layer or Row; then you must cover it with another Crucible mouth to mouth, the upper having a hole bored at bottom, then lute them well together. The Lute being dry put the Crucible in a <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Wheel-Fire.</hi>
                  </note> Round Fire during six hours, and hot ashes underneath. The first two hours the fire must be one foot distant from the Crucible the two second hours one half foot nearer; and the two last hours quite close covering the Crucible; You must take special care that the matter does not melt, and that the fire be not too great, for that would spoil all. The Crucible being cold, you must take it out, and emptying the matter pound it well; this is what we call <hi>Aes ustum.</hi> To make it fit for use you must wash it, to take away the Sulphur, and then dry it and keep it in a close Vessel.</p>
               <p>There are other curious Persons who make an <hi>Aes ustum</hi> yet finer than this, and more penetrating in Colours; but the preparation is more costly and requires more time; for instead of Brimstone and Salt-Petre they make use of a purified Sulphur and fixed with <hi>Sal Armoniac</hi>; and instead of ordinary red <hi>Vitriol</hi> they use <hi>Roman Vitriol</hi> which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with Lee of Urine, and a fusil Salt, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they put in a reverberatory. But since the others serve well enough for colouring Glass, and are easier to make, we shall not here give you the preparation of this last which would be too long, and being more serviceable to several other purposes which Experience testifies.</p>

Take as much <hi>aes ustum</hi> of the Precedent <hi>Chap.</hi> as you please, add to it its weight of good Verdigrease, and as much <hi>Sal Armoniac</hi> fix'd and fusil; pound the whole together well, and dry them over the fire in an Iron Fire-shovel: Then pour into the shovel Lee of Urine, and make the whole boil till the Lee be entirely consum'd; Then put on more of the same Lee; boil it till the Lee be consumed as before, and reiterate it a third time. Then pound or grind the Matter and put it in a Reverberatory to Calcine well, then pound it again into an impalpable Powder, and put it into an Earthen glazed Pot; pour upon the same Lee of Urine, wherein you dissolve it, <hi>viz.</hi> to each pound of Lee, four ounces of <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> fix'd and fusil. Then boil the whole over a little fire in ashes for a quarter of an hour, then decant off that Lee into some fit Vessel, for that will contain the Tincture of the <hi>aes ustum,</hi> and of the Green which it has Extracted. Put more Lee upon the Matter, and boil it yet a quarter of an hour over the same Fire, then decant off that Lee to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:55296:24"/>
thus continue to water it with fresh Lee and decant it off to the former as long as it will extract any Tincture from the matter. Then take all these tinctured Lees, and filter them thro' whited brown paper, then Evaporate three quarters over a gentle Fire. And put the remainder into an Alembick, with the Helm (or head) on, and the Receiver, and distil it till it be dry: Then you will find at bottom of the Alembick a <hi>Crocus Veneris,</hi> of a very wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Virtue for colouring Glass and other Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Operations, and some Medicinal Uses.</p>

               <p>This Colour, which is one of the finest Sky-Colours, ought to be made in fine and well purifi'd Crystal, which the <hi>Italians</hi> call <hi>Bollito,</hi> for if you make it in common Glass it is not so fair: You must likewise put no <hi>Manganese</hi> in this Colour. To make it therefore very fine and beautiful, Take Crystal-Fritt, put it in a Pot in the Furnace, where being well melted and clear, you must skim off the Salt, which will swim on the top like Oil, with an iron Ladle: for if you should not take it off, the Colour would be foul and oily. The Matter being well purified, you must add to it, to every 20 pounds or thereabouts, 6 Ounces of the Powder of Copper calcin'd, as we have taught in Chapt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>WE ought to have put this Colour of <hi>Turcois</hi> after the Blue, and before the Green, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is a particular and principal Colour, we thought it would not be amiss to conclude this book with it. For this colour take a pot full of Crystal Fritt tinged of an <hi>Aqua-Marina</hi> Colour or Blue, whereof we have given several preparations; which colour must be fair and full, for all depends on that. It being well melted put into it little by little sea-salt decrepitated, white and reduced to Powder, mixing it well and softly as we have noted in speaking of other Metalline Colours; and the Blue from clear and transparent will become thick, for the Salt penetrating the Glass takes away its Transpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, and causes a Paleness; hence alone comes the <hi>Turcois</hi> Colour used in Glass. When the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour is right to the Workman's Fancy, it must be presently wrought, for the Salt will evaporate, and make the Glass transparent and disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. If in working this Metal the Colour fades or goes off, you must add a little more of the same decrepitated Salt as before, and the Colour will return.</p>
               <p>We will here advertise the Workman, that he must take care that his Salt be well decrepitated, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it will always crackle, and be apt to fly in his Eyes, and endanger his Sight. You must (as I have said) put in the Salt by Intervals, till the Colour Pleases you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:55296:29"/>It will suffice for this use, that the Fritt tinged <hi>Aqua-Marina</hi> or Blue, be made of one half Crystal Metal, and the other of <hi>Rochetta,</hi> and the Colour will be very fair and good.</p>

               <p>BEfore I proceed to the Explication of these preparations, it will be necessary to shew those of some <hi>Minerals</hi> used for such Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions. And although one may buy several of them Publickly, ready made, yet our design being
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:55296:30"/>
to make this work as perfect as we can, it will be necessary that we shew the Chymical way of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them after the best manner, by which the curious in this Art may do it themselves for less charge than they can buy them. There is no doubt, but that the Metalline matters made use of to tinge Glass, may give it several colours more lively and brighter than any it receives in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Furnaces, when these matters are artfully prepared, and their Metalline Colours are choice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pick'd out and Collected, and well purified from Heterogeneous matters which hinder the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of their Tincture to the Glass. The colour of Chalcedony, or rather the matter whereof it is made, is nothing but an Amassement of Several Colours which may be made in Glass, and which many are not acquainted with. We will shew the whole process and the way of well succeeding in it. It is most certain that all the Colours we can extract will never give that Beauty and Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor to Glass which is desired, if they be not well prepared. You must therefore for this purpose well calcine and dissolve the metals with <hi>Aqua For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</hi> You must open the <hi>Copper, Sulphur, Vitriol</hi> and <hi>Sal Armoniac</hi> and other minerals with a great deal of patience, and prepare them at a gentle Fire, the violence of the fire being very noxious in this affair as well as in others, which very often ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Operations defective, which otherwise would succeed well, among those who are impatient or ignorant. You must observe Regularity in all those Cases we shall treat of, and exact proportions of the Doses, and put them in, in fit and due time, otherwise the Process will miscarry; especially in the Red Colour whereof we treat in the 8th Book, and in the <hi>Tartar</hi> that it may be perfectly Calcin'd. You must yet further observe that the Metal be
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:55296:31"/>
well Boiled, well Purified, and made fit for Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; then proceed in it as diligent Workmen ought to do. Thus you may perfectly imitate Agat, oriental Chalcedony, with the Fairest and most Beautifull Colours, and wavings, so lively and full, that it will seem as if nature her self could not arrive to the like perfection, or art imitate it. Yet experience shews us that in several things, and in particular in this Art of Colouring Glass, that Art cannot only imitate nature, but also far sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass her. The Eye and Phancy shall be judge, in the three ways which we will shew, where every thing shall appear so distinctly, that the curious shall easily understand it, and all that will apply themselves to it may succeed therein, if they do not deviate from these precepts. If they are well put in practice, you'll find more than we can tell you.</p>

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:55296:31"/>
to which add seven Ounces of <note n="*" place="bottom">

But before you put the Cucurbite or Body on, you must lay Sand four Inches deep, and thick Iron-Bars to bear the weight, then fit a head, and lute the joints well, with a lute made of fine Flour and Lime powdered, and mixt with whites of Eggs: then put on the Joints roulers of fineLinen, then lute it again and then put on Linen roulers again, three or four times, each time letting it dry before you put on the next rouler. And then this will bear the Violence of the Fire, and the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating force of the Spirits of the <hi>Aqua-Fortis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After that, you must put this Body of the <hi>Alembick</hi> in a deep Earthen-Pan, made of the same Earth as <hi>Crucibles,</hi> filled with Sand, so that it be buried in the Sand to within two Inches of the joints; then set it in a Wind Furnace fit, and capable to maintain an equal Fire. We here give you the figure of it, this Furnace may serve for several uses, as we will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after Explain.</p>
               <p>Your <hi>Alembic</hi> being thus fitted, you must put to the head a Glass Receiver very capacious, the better to resist the force of the Spirits, otherwise all may break. Lute it well to the Mouth of the <hi>Alembic,</hi> as you did the joints before, and with the same precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of letting it dry each time in the Air, taking care not to kindle the Fire in the Furnace, till the lute of all the joints be dry, for that is very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.</p>
               <p>The whole being thus in right order, kindle a small coal Fire for the space of three hours, during
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:55296:32"/>
which time the windy humour that is in the Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, and which would break them will be drawn of into the Receiver. So continue a moderate Fire for six hours, then encrease it little by little, putting on at last billets of dry Oaken-Wood to the coals, for six hours more, till the <hi>Alembic</hi> or head begin to be tinged yellow, and the Spirits begin to rise. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to continue this Regimen or degree of Fire, till the head and receiver begin to grow red; then augment it till the <hi>Alembic</hi> become of a deep red; continue this degree of the Fire as long as that Colour lasts, till all the Spirits are drawn of, and the Head and Receiver begin by degrees to grow clear, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assume their common Colour in cooling; which sometimes will be two days first. Notwithstanding you must continue the Fire some time afterward; then let the Furnace cool of its self; taking care, that whilst the <hi>Alembic</hi> and Receiver are still red, and the Fire in force, that you admit no cool Air into the place, and that nothing cold touch them, which would break them. When all is cold, cover the head and receiver with wet Linen cloaths, that the Spirits (which are about the Head and Receiver) may the better sink to the bottom of the Receiver, and let it stand so twelve hours. Then bath the joints and the luting with warm Water, that you may the better loosen the bandage, and so take off the head from the Receiver, otherwise it would be difficult to do it; then you may break the body which will be good for nothing, and take out the <hi>Faeces</hi> which reduce again into Powder: add to each Pound of that Powder, four Ounces of refin'd Nitre, and put the whole into a Cucurbit (or Body) whereon pour all the <hi>Aqua-Fortis</hi> before distill'd; then put on the Head and Receiver, and lute it and dry it well as you did before; having put it on the same Sand Furnace, during the first four hours make a gentle Fire, which
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:55296:32"/>
afterwards may be encreased little by little, till the Head and Receiver begin to grow clear and all the Spirit is drawn over. After which let all cool, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the Head and Receiver with wet Cloaths; then let it stand twelve hours as before. Then unlute the joints again with warm Water, and put the <hi>Aqua-Fortis</hi> into Glass Vessels well stopt, that the Spirits may not exhale, and keep it so for uses hereafter to be mentioned. This is the <hi>Aqua-Fortis</hi> which is commonly called Water of separation, and the best that can be made. There are some that instead of Roch-allom take the best Roman Vitriol, or the like. You may know whether the Vitriol be proper for this use or not by rubbing it on a piece of well polish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Iron; if it be it will leave a Copper Colour on it; Then this Vitriol, the purification whereof we will give in the next Chapter, will make an <hi>Aqua-Fortis</hi> far more penetrating than the former.</p>
               <p>Now we come to shew how to make the lute which we promised, which tho' common is very usefull in this Case. You must take one Part of Lome (a fat Earth) which is found in Rivers, 3 Parts of Sand, of common Wood Ashes well sifted, and of the Shearings of woollen Cloath each one half; mix the whole well together, and putting water to them make a soft past, to which add one third part of common Salt Powder'd, and work them all well together, then use them in luting your vessels.</p>
               <p>Here follows the description of a usefull Furnace, which may serve instead of several others, the Number whereof would be troublesome, it being proper for several Operations. To render this Furnace more Intelligible to those who are not acquainted with it, we have here given a Cut of it, whereon we have marked <hi>A. B.

               <head>CHAP. LIII. The way of purifying <hi>Vitriol</hi> to make <hi>Aqua-Fortis</hi> stronger and more penetrative.</head>
               <p>WE have promised in the preceding Chapter, to shew the way of purifying Vitriol, which consists in taking away its Yellowness, which alone hinders the good effects it is capable of producing.</p>
               <p>Take <hi>Roman</hi> Vitriol, the best you can get; dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve it in common warm Water, then let it stand three days; then filter it, and fling away the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Faeces</hi>; then evaporate in Glass Bodies two thirds of the Water, and put the Remainder into Earthen glaz'd Pans, and set it in a cool place for the Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stals of it to shoot, which in 12 hours time they will do, about the Brims of the Pans in little trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent pieces, like natural Crystal of an Emerald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Colour; and at bottom there will remain a sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous Sediment, which must be carefully sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and cast away.</p>
               <p>Then you must take all those little green Crystals, and dissolve them again in warm Water, as before, and then filter and evaporate them in the same Glass
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:55296:35"/>
Bodies: And set them again to crystallize, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in a cool place, taking care to separate all the yellow <hi>Faeces</hi> you find. Reiterate this Process of disolving, and filtering, evaporating, and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stallizing the third time; then you will have a well purified and refined <hi>Vitriol.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We will here add for the sake of the curious, that those who make use of Vitriol instead of Roach-Allum, to make <hi>Aqua-Fortis,</hi> the Preparation whereof we have shewn in the precedent Chap. ought to take a special care in the Distillation, that assoon as the Red Fumes are passed, all the Spirits of Nitre are raised, and that then the Fire must be extinguished; for that which follows after, is only Spirit of Vitriol, which hinders the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit of Nitre in the Solution of Metals.</p>
               <p>You may also draw a parting Water in 12 hours time, (as some Refiners do) during which time, but little Spirit of Vitriol can arise with their fires.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>AQua Regalis,</hi> is nothing but a common <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Fortis,</hi> wherein you dissolve ¼ of its weight of <hi>Sal-Armoniac.</hi> But to have a good and strong <hi>Aqua-Regalis</hi> you must take one pound of <hi>Aqua-Fortis</hi> prepared as in Chap. 52. put it in a Glass Matrass, and add to it only 2 Ounces of <hi>Sal Armoniac,</hi> then put the Matrass into a warm Bath or Pan, of warm Water, and stir it often, that the <hi>Sal armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niac</hi> may be well dissolved in the <hi>Aqua-Fortis,</hi> which
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:55296:36"/>
will be tinged of a yellow Colour. Then you must add as much <hi>Sal-Armoniac</hi> to it as the <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Fortis</hi> can dissolve, then let it settle a little; and the <hi>Sal-Armoniac</hi> will leave at the bottom all its Terrestreity. After that decant it gently off into another Vessel, so that you don't trouble the settling at bottom, or rather filter it through whited-brown Paper. This Water will dissolve Gold and other Metals, far better than the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Aqua Regalis,</hi> except Silver, which it toucheth not at all, for reasons which Chymists are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with.</p>

               <head>CHAP. LV. Another way of making <hi>Aqua-Regalis</hi> far stronger than the former.</head>
               <p>OUr Design being not only to shew Operations and Processes proper for Glass, but also for the sake of Gentlemen chymically inclin'd, whose Curiosities are not contented with what's common, or with ordinary Preparations; those which we here give of <hi>Aqua-Regalis</hi> are among the number of those, whose Virtues are far above the common Preparations, they more intimately pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating and dissolving Gold and other Metals than others, rendring them more volatile, and consequently more proper to be drawn over in Distillations.</p>
               <p>The first is that which some Philosophers call the Water of the two Champions, which is made with two parts of purified Sulphur, two parts of purified <hi>Sal-Armoniac,</hi> and one part of calcin'd <hi>Flints,</hi> all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to powder, and mixed well together. Then take an earthen Retort, which must have a little hole
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:55296:36"/>
on the back (or Curvature) on the upper side, through which you may put in the Ingredients. For the more safety sake, you may lute the Body of the Retort over well, and let it dry; then put it in the Furnace we have describ'd <hi>chap.</hi> LII. and fit to it a great Glass Recipient (by reason of the violence of the Spirits) wherein you may put a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle common Water to attract them; lute the Joints of them as you do for <hi>Aqua-Fortis,</hi> and let them be well dry'd before you kindle the fire, for Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons we have elsewhere assigned.</p>
               <p>The Lute being dry, and all in right Order, you must begin by a gentle fire, that the Retort may grow warm by degrees, and afterwards gradually encrease it till it grow red-hot. Then put in at the Hole of the Retort four Ounces at a time of the Ingredients you have prepared, and stop it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain presently. Doing thus you will see in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> great quantities of cloudy Vapours arise, and pass into the Receiver, and fill it, which will dissolve little by little, mixing themselves with the common Water, and the Receiver will grow clear. Assoon as you perceive this, you must put four Ounces more of your Ingredients into the Retort, and give time for the Vapours (arising again) to dissolve as before; then reiterate this Process till all your Ingredients are distill'd off. Then unlute your Receiver, and pour the Liquor into an Alem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick, and draw off the Phlegm in <hi>Balneo Mariae,</hi> and rectifie it in an Ash-Fire: Then your Water will be made, and fit to dissolve any Metal but Silver.</p>

               <head>CHAP. LVI. Another way of making <hi>Aq. Reg.</hi> more easie, and with less precaution.</head>
               <p>THIS second way of making <hi>Aq. Reg.</hi> will be more easie than the former, and the Water of as much force. Take 1 pound of good Salt-Petre, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, and mix it with 3 Pound of Potters Clay, or Flints calcined to Powder; put the whole into a Glass Retort well luted, and sit to it a great Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, lute the Joints well, then put it in a reverbera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Furnace, and distil it according to Art in a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Fire. When all the red Spirits are passed over, as we have explained in speaking of <hi>Aq. fortis</hi> in the 52 Chapter. Then draw off the Phlegm in <hi>Balneo Mariae</hi> (which the Chymists and we hereafter will note by the two Letters <hi>B. M.</hi>) then rectifie it in an Ash Furnace, and keep it for use.</p>
               <p>Then take a Pound of Sal Armoniac, well pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, and mix it with four Pound of Wood-Ashes, (out of which you have before extracted all the Salt with warm Water) then put the whole into a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort, sit a Receiver to it, and distil it in a Sand-Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, and the Spirit of the Sal Armoniac will pass over into the Receiver.</p>
               <p>Then unlute your Receiver, and take off that Phlegm of the Spirit in <hi>B. M.</hi> and rectifie it in Ashes. This done, take equal parts of each of these Spirits; then mix them together and distil them in an Ash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Furnace. Then you'll have a strong Menstruum for dissolving Gold.</p>
               <p>I can't here omit, that the Spirit of Sea-water Salt distill'd as Salt-petre, has the same effects as the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the 2 <hi>Champions</hi> whereof we have given the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:55296:37"/>
Preparation in the preced. Chap. and as that we have just now treated of; and in the mean while is not so sharp nor corrosive. You must, to make it succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, take 3 parts of Spirits of Sea-water Salt, and add to it one part of Salt-petre, then distil it together in an Ash-Furnace, the better to unite them. Then you'll have an <hi>Aqua Regalis,</hi> which will dissolve Gold sooner than the Spirit of Sal-Armoniac, and which will make it rise and pass over in the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; thus you may this easie way make it more fit for the use you design it for.</p>
               <p>But notwithstanding this, you must not imagine that this Solution of Gold is a radical and total one, because it will pass over in an Alembic, and that so it is reduc'd into a Species of <hi>Aurum potabile:</hi> For there is nothing but the one Sovereign Menstruum of the Philosophers, which has that virtue, as being homogeneous to it, and formed of it. That is the only Liquor in which it can putrisie and be totally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, and regenerated again after the manner of the Phoenix, to become a Spiritual and Glorious Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, capable of performing all those wonderful Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects ascrib'd to it.</p>

               <head>CHAP. LVIII. A way to make a fair <hi>Chalcedony</hi> in Glass.</head>
               <p>ALtho <hi>Chalcedony</hi> is not so dear as it has been heretofore, since it is found in <hi>Europe</hi>; yet Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have not left off counterfeiting it by help of Art, to make several Works of it no less beautiful than the true, and much cheaper.</p>
               <p>We will shew three different ways to prepare this <hi>Chalcedony,</hi> which will make three different Species of it, all of them very fair, but whose Beauty may be also augmented by the number of Ingredients we compose them of, and which cause those Diversities of Colours, which that Stone ought to have.</p>
               <p>Among the rest of the Ingredients we employ in this Subject, there are some that give no colour to Glass, as Tartar, Soot, Sal-Armoniac and Mercury.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:55296:38"/>
Those that are of an unctuous Nature, as Lead, Soot, Tartar, the Azure-stone often hinder the Union of the Ingredients, by reason of the Separation which may happen by the cooling the Metal; which does not happen to those who know how to observe the degree of heat, wherein the principal knowledge of this Art consists.</p>
               <p>To make the first sort of <hi>Chalcedony:</hi> Put two Pound of <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> (whereof we have given the Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>Chap.</hi> 52.) into a Glass Body with a long Neck, four Ounces of fine Silver in small and thin Plates, or granulated, put the Body in an Ash Furnace over a soft Fire, or in warm Water, and the Silver will be presently dissolv'd. At the same time take ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Body and dissolve in it 6 Ounces of Quick-silver in a Pound and half of the same <hi>Aqua fortis.</hi> After that pour both the Solutions together into a greater Body, which put in the same Bath, or warm Water, or Ash-Furnace: then add to it six Ounces of <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Armoniac,</hi> which dissolve over a gentle Fire; then put to it one Ounce of <hi>Zaffer,</hi> and half an Ounce of <hi>Manganese</hi> prepared, little by little, with as much <hi>Ferretto</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> also little by little, for fear the Matter coming to swell too much should break the Vessel. Add to all these Ingredients one Ounce of <hi>Crocus Martis</hi> calcined with Sulphur; as much Scales of Copper thrice calcined, which ought to boil like <hi>Manganese</hi>; as much blue Lake that the Painters use; and the same quantity of Red Lead, the whole reduc'd into Powder. In putting in these Powders you must gently stir the Glass Body, that they may the better incorporate with the <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless take care there be not too much heat; then you must well stop the Matras (or Glass Body) stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it well every Day for ten Days, that the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders may well incorporate, and that they may always appear as separated from the Water. After that
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:55296:39"/>
put the great Glass Body in a Sand-Furnace in a temperate heat, or rather empty it into a GlassCucur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, after having luted it at the bottom, and put it over the same Fire, so that the <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> may eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate in 24 Hours, and at bottom of the Vessel you will have a yellow Powder, which keep safely in Glasses for use. When you are to make <hi>Chalcedony,</hi> take white Crystal in Glass, well purified, and that has been often melted; for Crystal new made is not fit for that Operation, because the Colours will not stick to it, but are consumed by the Frit. Put about twenty Pound of this sort of Crystalline Glass into a Pot; and being well melted, put in about three Ounces of your Yellow Powder at three different times, mix the Glass well with it each time, that the Powder may incorporate with it, the Glass being thus well mixed, let it stand an Hour, then mix it once more and let it stand during 24 Hours: Then mix it again for the last time, and make an Essay of it, it will give a yellowish Azure colour. Having made your Essay, and found your Matter right, you may take your Pot out of the Furnace, and when it is cold you'll have colours which shall represent Wavings of the Sea, and other fine things. But to have a very fair <hi>Chalcedony,</hi> you must make a second Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to join to the first, by taking eight Ounces of Tartar calcined, as we have shewn <hi>Chap.</hi> 41. Two Ounces of Soot of the Chimney well purified, half an Ounce of <hi>Crocus Martis</hi> calcined with Sulphur: Mix the whole well together, then put it into the melted Metal at five or six different times; otherwise the Impetuous Swelling of the Materials would break the Pot, and the whole would be lost; which may be avoided by putting it in little by little, stirring it each time well, that the Matters may incorporate: Make the Pot also boil, then let it stand twenty four Hours. After which you may work it into what you
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:55296:39"/>
please, which put in the Furnace to whiten, and see if the Glass please you; if it be green without, and blue, white, red, yellow and of other Colours like Jasper and Oriental Agat. If looking on it obliquely it be red like Fire, and held to the Sun it shew the Colours of the Rain-bow by reflection of the Rays; if so, then it is fit to make all sorts of Vessels which may be polished at the Wheel. If it be pale and clear, you must add to it more calcined Tartar and Soot as before, stirring it well to make it incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; then let the Glass stand and purifie several Hours, and afterwards work it as you please.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chalcedony</hi> is much used for the Effigies of Kings and Princes, for Heads, Cups, and many other Vessels; principally for making Seals, because it may be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved easily, and the Wax will not stick to it.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THE second sort of <hi>Chalcedony</hi> ought to be finer than the former: The Preparations are as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
               <p>Put into a Glass Body a Pound of <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and three Ounces of coppel'd Silver granulated, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to dissolve.</p>
               <p>In another Glass Body put also a Pound of <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> with five Ounces of Mercury well puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and passed through the Glove, and close it well.</p>
               <p>Take likewise another Glass Vessel, and put into it also a Pound of <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> with two Ounces of <hi>Sal-Armoniac</hi> to dissolve in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:55296:40"/>After it is dissolv'd add to it <hi>Crocus Martis</hi> prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as in <hi>Chap.</hi> 27. <hi>Feretto</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> of <hi>Chap.</hi> 22. Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per calcined as in <hi>Chap.</hi> 32. Leaves of Copper calcin'd by means of Sulphur, as in <hi>Chap.</hi> 31. of each half an Ounce, the whole reduced into Powder; taking care to put them in one after another, and little by little, for fear the Vessel should break.</p>
               <p>Then put in another Earthen Body, one Pound of <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> with two Ounces of <hi>Sal-Armoniac</hi>; and the whole being dissolv'd, add successively as before of good crude Antimony, of blue Enamel which the Painters use; of red Lead, and of Vitriol well purified of each one half Ounce; the whole well powder'd, and put in little by little, as we have said, for fear of breaking the Vessel, then close it well.</p>
               <p>Take also another Glass Body, wherein put one Pound of <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and two Ounces of <hi>Sal-Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niac</hi>; being dissolv'd, add to it two Ounces of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared <hi>Zaffer,</hi> as we have shewn in <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an Ounce of <hi>Manganese</hi> of <hi>Piedmont</hi> also pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, as in <hi>Chap.</hi> 18. half an Ounce of thrice calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Copper, as in <hi>Chap.</hi> 33. with an Ounce of <hi>Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar</hi>; the whole being well pounded, put it by little and little into the Vessel; taking care (as we have said) that the Powders don't by too much swelling break the Vessel; then close it well.</p>
               <p>You must have a sixth Vessel of the same bigness with the rest, wherein likewise put a Pound of <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and two Ounces of <hi>Sal-Armoniac</hi>; as soon as it is dissolved, cast in two Ounces of Ceruse little by little, for that will cause a great fermentation. Then add the like weight of Painters red Lake, and as much of Iron Scales from the Anvil, putting it in little by little, as we have heretofore admonish'd, and for the same Reasons; and lastly proceed very
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:55296:40"/>
slowly in all these Operations; then stop your Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel well.</p>
               <p>All your six Vessels being on a gentle fire of Ashes, or in a warm Bath, to hasten the Solution of your Materials, you must stir them at least six times a Day, during the twelve in which you leave them in that heat, that the <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> may the better penetrate the Powders, and they communicate their Tinctures the better to the Glass. The twelve Days being past, take a great Glass Crucible that will hold the whole, and lute it well for fear of breaking; let the lute dry, then pour in gently your Materials in the six Matras's one after the other, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving well stirred each of them beforehand; then put your Cucurbite on a gentle Ash Fire, and fit to it a Head and Receiver, and lute well the Joints; then distil gently all the <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> for the space of Twenty four Hours, that is in the Body, making a very gentle Fire towards the end, otherwise the Powders may be spoiled by too much heat, and the Spirits which ought to remain in the Powder would pass into the Receiver. Then they will remain at the bottom of the Vessel of a yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowish red colour, which keep in a Glass well stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, for tinging Glass, or Crystal, which is yet better, as I have shewn in the preceding Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

               <head>CHAP. LX. The third and last way of <hi>Chalcedony.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THIS third way surpasses the other two in Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; it is something tedious, but the Learned know that what is most perfect, requires most time.</p>
               <p>To make this Preparation, you must use the <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> of <hi>Chap.</hi> 52. putting one Pound in a Glass Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trass, with four Ounces of Leaf-Silver to dissolve, and stop the Matras.</p>
               <p>Take another Matras, wherein put a Pound of the same <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> with five Ounces of Mercury pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with Salt and Vinegar after this manner. Take common Salt, sprinkle it with Vinegar in a Wooden-dish, where add to it a little common fair Water to make it dissolve, put in your Mercury, and stir it well with a Wooden-Pestle to draw out the Blackness; repeat washing them often with fresh Salt and Vinegar, till there be no more Blackness; then dry them with warm Linen or Cotton, and pass it thro' the Glove, then it will be purified, and fit to put in your <hi>Aqua fortis.</hi> When it is dissolved, stop the Matras and keep it.</p>
               <p>Take another Glass Body, wherein put a Pound of <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> with three Ounces of fine Silver calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Amalgamate the Silver with the Mercury, as the Goldsmiths usually do, and put it into a Crucible, with its weight of common Salt purified, as we have heretofore shewn: Then put the Crucible on hot Coals, that the Mercury may evaporate, and that only the Silver remain at bottom, which will be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified and calcined. Then add to that calcined Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:55296:41"/>
an equal weight of common Salt purified as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, mix them well together, and put them over the Fire in a Crucible to calcine them afresh; then wash them well with warm Water to take out the Salt; then put this Silver into a Glass Vial fill'd with common Water, which boil till one fourth part be consumed, then let it cool and settle to the bottom, then decant off the Water, and put more upon it: Reiterate this Process with fresh Water three times, and at the fourth dry the Silver, and put it into your <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and stir it well, and stop the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tras.</p>
               <p>We have promised to give the way of purifying common Salt, which is this. Take what quantity you will of Sea-Salt, dissolve it in a convenient quantity of common Water, boiling it for the space of two Hours, then let the Water rest, that the earthy part of the Salt may settle to the bottom: Then filter the Water, and evaporate it in an Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Vessel, or rather in a Glass Cucurbit, till the Salt remain dry at the bottom. Dissolve this Salt again, making the Water boil, then let it stand for the Dregs to settle, after which filter it and evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate it as before; which you must continue to do, till it leave no more Faeces or Dregs, and it will be well purified and prepared.</p>
               <p>To continue our Preparation of the Materials, you must put into a Glass Matras a Pound of <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> with three Ounces of purified <hi>Sal-Armoniac</hi>; that is to say, filter'd and whitened till it leave no Faeces or Dregs, as we have shewn in common Salt: Then dissolve in that Water a quarter of an Ounce of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and stop the Vessel well.</p>
               <p>Take another Glass Matras, and put into it also a Pound of <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> with two Ounces of <hi>Sal-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniac</hi>; being dissolv'd, put into that Water, of <hi>Cinnabar,</hi> of <hi>Crocus Martis</hi> calcined with Sulphur as
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:55296:42"/>
above; of <hi>Vltramarine,</hi> and of <hi>Ferretto</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> prepared as in <hi>Chap.</hi> 22. of each half an Ounce, the whole well pounded into Powder; you must do this little by little as we have heretofore hinted for fear of breaking the Vessel, by the fermentation which they make with the <hi>Aqua fortis</hi>; then stop the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tras.</p>
               <p>Put into another Matras a Pound of <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and dissolve in it two Ounces of <hi>Sal-Armoniac</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; add to it of <hi>Crocus Martis</hi> calcined, as in <hi>Chap.</hi> 25, with calcined Tin, known among the Glass-Men, of <hi>Zaffer</hi> described in <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. and of <hi>Cinnabar,</hi> of each half an Ounce, the whole well powder'd, and cast little by little into your Matras, for the Reasons before assigned, which require that great precaution; then stop the Matras.</p>
               <p>Take another Glass Body, wherein put one Pound of <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and dissolve in it two Ounces of <hi>Sal-Armoniac</hi>; then add one Ounce of small Leaves of Copper calcined, as in <hi>Chap.</hi> 31, half an Ounce of Scales of Copper thrice calcined, as describ'd in <hi>Chap.</hi> 34, half an Ounce of <hi>Manganese</hi> of <hi>Piedmont</hi> prepared, as in <hi>Chap.</hi> 18, and half an Ounce of Scales of Iron which fall from the Smiths Anvil, the whole well pounded, which cast little by little into your Matras for fear of breaking it, then stop it well.</p>
               <p>Put into another Glass Body one Pound of <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and two Ounces of <hi>Sal-Armoniac:</hi> The disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution being made, put to it little by little half an Ounce of red Lead, one Ounce of Scales of Copper of <hi>Chap.</hi> 34, half an Ounce of crude Antimony, and as much <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> of Vitriol purified, the whole well pulveriz'd; then stop the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tras.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:55296:42"/>Take another Glass Matras, put into it one Pound of <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> with two Ounces of <hi>Sal-Armoniac</hi>; add to that Water of Orpiment, of white Arsnick, of Painters Lake, half an Ounce of each; the whole being well powder'd, and put into a Matras with the same precaution as before, stop it well.</p>
               <p>We have not repeated at each Operation, that you must put your Matras on an Ash Furnace over a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle heat, or in a warm Bath to hasten the Solution of the Materials; because we have told you it must be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways done in <hi>Chap.</hi> 58, in speaking of the Preparation of those things which serve to tinge the first Species of Chalcedony; which may suffice for the instruction of those who employ themselves in this Art. We will add, that all the nine Matrasses mentioned in this Chapter, must remain fifteen Days in the same heat, stirring them often every Day, that the Water may the better operate on the Materials subtilizing them, and well opening their Tinctures. Then put all these Materials, with the <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> into a great Glass Body, little by little, that they may unite well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Close the Body and set it in the same heat, stirring it well for six Days. After that, take a great Glass Cucurbit well luted half way up the Body of it, put it on an Ash Furnace, put into it all the Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials out of your Body, fit to it a Head and Receiver, lute well all the Joints, then distil it during the space of twenty four Hours, over a very gentle Fire, for fear the Colours should be spoil'd, that the Water pass gently over, and the Spirits remain in the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which of green will become yellow.</p>
               <p>Thus putting that Powder in the requisite Dose (as we have taught in the first Species of <hi>Chalcedony</hi>) into purified Glass Metal, made of broken pieces of Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stal, and not of Fritt; and adding to it in its due time, calcined Tartar, Soot of Chimney, <hi>Crocus
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:55296:43"/>
Martis</hi> made with Vinegar, observing all we have on this Subject remarked, these Materials will give an opacity to Glass, which may be worked twenty four Hours afterwards, managing it well with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Tools, and often heating it; and you'll have things made of an extraordinary Beauty, greater then can be imagin'd.</p>

               <p>THERE are several Ways of giving Glass the Colour of Gold, of Amethist, of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phir and others; which are not unknown to the Curious in this Art; and as there is generally some one way more particular and finer than the rest, several may be ignorant of that; for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son this Third Book is destin'd to that end, <hi>viz.</hi> to

               <p>Take two parts of Crystal Fritt, made with <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,</hi> and not with Sand, which is not so good; and one part of Fritt composed of two thirds of <hi>Tarso,</hi> and one third of fine Salt of <hi>Polverine,</hi> prepared as in <hi>Chap.</hi> 7, pound and mix them well, and to each hundred Pound of this Composition, add one Pound of Tartar purified, pounded and searced fine; and one Pound of <hi>Manganese</hi> of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> prepared as in <hi>Chap.</hi> 18, mixing well these Powders with the two Fritts, because you must not cast them on the melted Glass as in other Colours: Then put the whole little by little into a Pot, and put them into a Furnace,

wherein let them stand at an ordinary Fire four Days, for fear the Glass rising, should run over. When that Matter is well purified, you may use it for making Vessels, and what other Works you please, which will be of a fair colour.

               <p>THE beauty of this Colour is to express the Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowish-red of Fire, when it is exposed to the Sun: We will treat more largely of it in the fifth Book, in shewing the way to counterfeit this Stone, as also several others.</p>
               <p>To give Granat-colour to Glass: Take of Crystal Frit, of Fritt of <hi>Rochetta,</hi> each an equal quantity, mix them well, and to an hundred Pound of these Materials, add one Pound of <hi>Manganese</hi> of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> prepared as in <hi>Chap.</hi> 18, one Ounce of <hi>Zaffer,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared as in <hi>Chap.</hi> 17, mix them well with the Fritts, then put them little by little into an Earthen Pot made red-hot in the Furnace, because the Glass is apt to rise and run over.

                  <hi>AMethist</hi> being of a Violet Colour, proceeding from Red and Blue, must be well imitated to look beautiful. For this Colour, take Crystal Fritt well made, with <hi>Tarso</hi> and not Sand, this Colour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring no other; to which add to each Pound one Ounce of the following Powder, which mix well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether before they be put into the Pot. After that you must set the Pot to the Fire in the Furnace little by little, otherwise the violence of the Powder would cause it to break. When this Glass has been well purified for the space of four Days, and it has the colour of <hi>Amethist,</hi> you may work it. This Colour may be augmented or diminished by means of the Fritt, or Powder, according to the Discretion of the Workman.</p>
               <p>This is the Powder which produces the <hi>Amethist</hi> Colour in Glass. Take one Pound of <hi>Manganese</hi> of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> prepared as in <hi>Chap.</hi> 18, and an Ounce and half of <hi>Zaffer,</hi> prepared as in <hi>Chap.</hi> 17; mix them well together, and put the Dose we have shewn to each Pound of Fritt, to have a true <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thist</hi>-Colour.</p>

Then mix it very well, and make an Essay of the Colour, and if it be not full enough, augment or diminish it as much as you think fit; then the Glass may be wrought, and you will have a <hi>Saphir</hi> of the Colour of the Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Violet of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> which the small Dose of <hi>Manganese</hi> produces.</p>

               <p>THE Green Viper Colour is not disagreeable, but it is very dangerous to make, by reason of the Materials whereof it is composed, if you are not very careful in making it. Take two Ounces of Rock Crystal of a good Water, two Ounces of crude Antimony, and as much Orpiment, with one Ounce of <hi>Sal-Armoniack</hi>; reduce these three last into Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: Stratifie with these Powders the Pieces of Crystal, in a good Crucible; cover it with another that is bored through the bottom, lute them well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and when the Lute is dry, put them in the middle of the Coals in a Furnace, let them be gently lighted that the Crucible may grow hot by degrees. It will smoak very much when it first grows hot, wherefore this Operation must be made in a large Chimney, that the Smoak may fly away, and you must go out of the Laboratory, because it is very dangerous and may prove Mortal. Let the Fire kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of it self, and the Crucible grow cold; then take out the Pieces of Crystal which lie on the top of the Crucible, which will have the Colour of Rubies, and be marked with fine Spots; and those which are at the bottom will for the most part have the Colour of Vipers. Separate the other pieces from them, which will be of other Colours, and polish the whole at the Wheel like other Stones, then with Foils you may set them in Gold. These Stones will be of a very agreeable colour. You might tinge a great number together, but that would be more charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>

               <p>IT seems something strange that Crystals mixed with Matters that tinge it, should in the same Vessel receive so many different Colours. But if you consider that the Spirits of these Matters, have Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues different from those of their Bodies, you will not so much wonder at such Diversities. The Pieces which lie highest, are the most penetrated by these tinging Spirits which always ascend, and so give them more vivacity and colour; and so to the others in proportion to your Orders.</p>
               <p>For this Operation, take two Ounces of Orpiment of a yellow Colour approaching Gold or Saffron, and as much White Arsenick; one Ounce of crude An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony, and the same weight of <hi>Sal-Armoniac</hi>; the whole reduced to Powder and mixed together. With this Powder stratifie pieces of Natural Crystal in a great Crucible, putting the least pieces to the bottom, and the greatest at the top which ought to be fine and without Spots. The Crucible being fill'd with the Powder and Crystal, cover it with another bored at the bottom, lute them well and let the lute dry. This last Crucible must (as we have said) be bored at bottom, that the smoak of the Materials as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending through the Hole, may better tinge the Crystals in passing, which it would not do so well if it passed out of the sides. When the Lute is dry, put it in the Furnace, and cover it with Coals up to the middle of the Crucible on the top, then put some live Coals to them, that they may kindle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

little by little, they ought to be great Coals, and made of Oak. You must take care of the Smoak, it being very dangerous, as we said before; and order it so that they kindle well, that the Business may suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, and that the Fire may go out of it self, taking care that no Air can get in at the Mouths of the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibles, for that would make the Crystals break, and then they are good for nothing.</p>
               <p>The Crucibles being cold unlute them, and take the Crystals out, the greatest parts of which will be tinged with the colours we have mentioned: Polish the best colour'd at the Wheel, which will also brighten their Colours, and make them look like Oriental Stones, and they'll be fair and hard as they are.</p>
               <p>All the Success of this Secret consists in the Orpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which must be of the colour of Gold; and if you don't succeed the first time, you must try a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; and observing well what we have said, you may be assured to succeed.</p>

               <p>GLASS of Lead, known to few Artists in this way, because they make no use of it by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of its brittleness, is beyond doubt, the fairest and noblest Glass of any other.

               <p>It is our Opinion, and that not without reason, that that subtilty whereby the Lead so easily in this case pierces the Pots when it is not wholly calcin'd, comes from a certain unctuous yellow Matter like Oyl, that is seen to swim on the top sometimes in a violent fusion. For we have often observed, That if that unctuous Matter be not taken off as soon as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears on the top, it will pierce the Pot, and so all run out among the Coals.</p>
               <p>This unctuous Matter has strange and infinite Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues known to the <hi>Adepti,</hi> both in curing Diseases, and other Operations.

               <p>WITHOUT doubt it will seem surprizing to several, that Art should be capable of imitating the Natural Colour of Precious Stones in so great Perfection, as that the Beauty of the Artificial should surpass that of the Natural Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ental
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:55296:57"/>
ones, in every thing excepting their hardness, which they have been many ages in acquiring: and I doubt not but several Ingenious Men are this day searching after means to give them that too. The Curious will find in this Book all that is necessary to attain this Art, nay, and to do something more than I mention. For since Art can easy imitate Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is not to be doubted but that Ingenious Men may some time or other arrive to give the same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to Crystals that precious Stones have acquired in the Bowels of the Earth.</p>
               <p>The Natural, or Rock Crystal, which we make use of, as the Basis of our Artificial Gems, is the only Stone that does not proceed from any Metal, being the first substratum of others, only made of a congealed Water, with a subtil Earth, as other precious Stones. Its Virtue proceeds from <hi>Mercury,</hi> and the Spirit of <hi>Raphael,</hi> having also a great Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy with <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Iupiter,</hi> whence it is proper for healing several Diseases. All the diversities of Gems proceed only from a sulphur or an unctuous Substance, which insinuates its self in their Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, which fixes them more or less and also tinges them. This Sulphur is an Exhalation of Metalline and Mineral Spirits, forced up by the Central Fire, which virtually contains divers Colours, and which are determin'd and brought into act by proper Subjects.</p>
               <p>Thus Granat and other precious Stones agree with Crystal, as Mercury does with Saturn, their harmony in the Heavens assures us of these reasons and proportions here on Earth.</p>
               <p>Precious Stones derive their Origin from the Stars and the Primum Mobile, as do the Metals both per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and imperfect, of the colour of Sulphur, and the qualities whereof they partake, and wherein they agree with the Stars. Great and wonderful
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:55296:57"/>
Operations might be performed with these Precious Stones, if they were separated from the Impurity of their <hi>terra damnata,</hi> and reduc'd by the universal <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struum</hi> into their first principles. It is only by this <hi>Menstruum,</hi> or mundane Spirit, that Metals and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals can also be so dissolv'd, that being full of their Attractive Virtues.</p>
               <p>We can boldly assert that this universal Spirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in it self all the secrets of Alchymy; and that without it, it is impossible to have the Tincture, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Salt of Precious Stones, or to make use of the admirable Virtues God has imparted to them. Yet I don't dispute but that there is a certain Acid Water Extracted from a Simple, wherein a dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gems may be made, and an admirable <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisterium,</hi> and a Precious Treasure for the Health, being prepar'd <hi>secundum Artem.</hi> That Water will also extract the Tincture of Gold, the Virtue of which is not less for preservation of Life, and curing several Malignant Fevers.</p>
               <p>As to Artificial Gems, which are the Subject of this Book; all the Art consists in rightly imitating the Tinctures of those that are fine, which must be extracted from Subjects that resist the Fire. The Tinctures we give them are fixed in the Crystals though volatile, without altering their Colour. As for example <hi>Verdigrease</hi> being put on the Fire, becomes of another Colour, but being in fusion with the Crystal it fixes and changes not its Colour; for natural Colours always return to their principle, and the great quantity of fixed, always retains some of the volatile. You must therefore for this end take permanent Colours which change not, being mixed one with another. For example Blue and Yellow make Green, you must therefore take a Blue that cannot be altered by the Yellow you mix with it; and a Yellow that cannot be altered by the Blue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so of others.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XCII. The Way of preparing Natural Crystal.</head>
               <p>WE have already given a very fine Preparation of Natural Crystal in the second Book, <hi>Chap.</hi> 76, yet we will give you here the principal one, which is its Calcination, and which we will explain at large.</p>
               <p>To perform this Calcination well, Take Natural Crystal the fairest you can get, since that is the Basis for Artificial Gems, it is no matter whether it be in great or small pieces. Fill with these Pieces of Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stal a large Crucible, cover it with a Cover made of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ame Earth, which must be somewhat broader than the Mouth of the Crucible, for fear Ashes or Coals tumble in, which you must take particular care of. Then set your Crucible in burning Coals in a little Furnace, and when your Crystal is well heated, cast it into a Vessel of cold Water, the more Water there is, so much the better will the Calcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be performed, because the cold of it is so much
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:55296:58"/>
the greater. Then take it out of the Water, and dry it in an Earthen Ladle, then put it into the same Crucible to be heated again, taking care to cover it well: Then cast it again <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nto fresh cold Water, and repeat heating it and quenching it thus twelve times, changing each time the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. You may know if your Crystal be well calcined, for it will easily break and crumble: If there appear in it any black Veins, you must take care to take them all clean out, by breaking them, and do this till only the White remains behind; then it is well prepared.</p>
               <p>After you have well dried your Crystals thus cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cined, grind them to an impalpable Powder on a Marble or Porphyry Stone, by putting a little on at a time, and fearce it well through a fine Silken Sieve.</p>
               <p>And since we use this Powder of Crystal for all Artificial Gems whereof we are going to treat, your best way will be to keep a good quantity by you, which you may always have recourse to in Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>If you design to succeed in this Art very well you must not use ordinary Fritt of Crystal, how good and fair soever it be, nor <hi>Chalcedony,</hi> nor <hi>Tarso,</hi> nor any other Stones; for the Glass made of them is far less fàir and resplendent than that made of Natural Crystal, which has the most lustre, and approaches nearest precious Stones, as we have already remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the preceding Chapter.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>NERI</hi> makes use of no Salt of <hi>Tartar,</hi> in all his Preparations of Artificial Gems; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing this Salt being prepared after a certain man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, we shall here relate, for the sake of the Curious. It serves in a great measure to work the Crystal, being a true Vehicle, for the better introducing the Colours that are to be given, and which is of use for the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures several ways.</p>
               <p>Those, who in their Operations of Artificial Gems, have made no use of Salt of <hi>Tartar,</hi> have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt been ignorant of this fine Preparation of it; for if you use ordinary Salt of <hi>Tartar,</hi> there is a Sulphur and Foulness in it, which renders Crystal obscure, and consequently would be hurtful in these Operations.</p>
               <p>To make this Salt, you must first calcine your <hi>Tartar,</hi> till it become Grey, and not to perfect White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and then dissolve it in warm Water to extract the Salt, filter that Water, and then evaporate it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Fire; then you'll have remaining at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Vessel, a White Salt. To take away all Foulness from this Salt, dissolve it again in warm Water, then evaporate it again over a gentle Fire; take it off the Fire, and cast it into cold Water, and you'll find it will leave on the surface of the Water a thick Froth, which you must skim off with a Skim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer that has little Holes no bigger than a small Pins Head: Put the Vessel again on the Fire, and evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Water as before, then take it off the Fire, and cast upon it fresh cold Water, and skim it well as
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:55296:59"/>
before. Reiterate this Process till you find no more Froth; then Evaporate the whole over a gentle Fire till it be dry, and you will have a Salt of <hi>Tartar</hi> well purified, which is not so fusil as the other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is free from all that Unctuosity which causes the Fusion. Keep this Salt of <hi>Tartar</hi> in a Vessel well stopped, and use of it in Crystal with your Colours when you set them to melt.</p>
               <p>Altho' this Salt of <hi>Tartar</hi> be very fine and pure, yet it is not that of the Philosophers, which has far more Virtue, and opens more powerfully the Metals and Minerals where it is employ'd, tho' it be of the same Nature as this, and extracted from the same Principle.</p>
               <p>The Philosophers have moreover another Salt of <hi>Tartar</hi> extracted from Metalline Matters; and this last is far more Excellent than any others.</p>
               <p>We will treat thereof at large in the Treatise we have promised, where we will explain the Virtues both of the one and the other, as well in Medicine as in the Business of Metals, and shew se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral very Curious Effects performed by their means.</p>

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:55296:60"/>
There are divers sorts of Emeralds, but at present, they are all distinguished into either oriental or Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental, the Orientals are more hard, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers less. We will shew several ways of Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e Emerald more or less full, which will be all Beautyful. This is the first.</p>
               <p>Take two Ounces of natural Crystal prepared, as we have shewn in <hi>Chap.</hi> 92. and 4 Ounces of common Minium or Read-Lead, powder'd and Searced, add 48 Grains of Verdigrease well pound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and of a good Colour, with 8 Grains of <hi>Crocus Martis</hi> prepared with Vinegar as we have shewn <hi>Chap.</hi> 25. Mix the whole well together, and put it into a good Crucible that will resist the fire, in it you must leave an Inch empty. Then cover the the Crucible with an Earthen Cover, lute it well, and dry it, then put it in the hottest place of a Potters Furnace where they make their Earthen Vessels, and let it stand as long as their Pots. Being cold break the Crucible and you'll find with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a matter of the Colour of a very fine Emerald. If you afterwards set it in Gold, it will surpass in Beauty the true Oriental Emerald.</p>
               <p>If it happens that your Matter is not enough re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin'd and purified, you must put it in again a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time in the same Furnace, where it will be purified as much as needs be; which you may know by lifting up the Cover, if the Matter appears shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
               <p>If it is not so, lute the Cover on again, and put the whole in the Furnace. You may take notice once for all, that you must not break the Crucible, before the Matter be throughly baked and purified, for if you do, and so are obliged to put the Matter into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Crucible, the Past will be painted and full of Blisters.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:55296:60"/>If you cannot easily come to a Potter's Furnace, you may make one your self with little Charge, wherein you may put twenty Crucibles at once, each of different Colours, so one Baking may serve for a great deal of Matter.</p>
               <p>You must make use of dry and hard Wood to heat the Furnace, as we have said before in baking Glass, and continue the Fire twenty four Hours, in which time your Matters ought to be baked and purified enough, but for more Surety you may continue the Fire six Hours longer, and they will be certainly ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked enough.</p>
               <p>Your Matter being thus rig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <head>CHAP. XCV. Another deeper Emerald-Colour.</head>
               <p>THAT which makes Emerald deeper than the precedent, proceeds from the smaller quantity of Crystal employ'd in it, with more of the other Materials, which make it more fair, but also more brittle. You must Bake it at least six Hours longer than the precedent, to take away that Imperfection which Lead usually gives. The Dose of this Past, is one Ounce of Natural Crystal prepared, as we have shewn, six Ounces and an half of Red-Lead, seventy five Grains of Verdigrease, ten Grains of <hi>Crocus Martis</hi> made with Vinegar, the whole pulverized and well mixed together; then follow the Method we have shewn, in the preceding Chapter, which
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:55296:61"/>
would be too tedious to repeat here, and on every occasion, so we will avoid it; only observing to let your Matter stand longer in the Fire, as we have said, and you'll have an admirable Oriental Emerald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour, which being set in Gold with a Foil of the same Metal underneath, will be inexpressibly fair.</p>

To make it, take four Ounces of Natural Crystal, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared as in <hi>Chap.</hi> 92, the fourth part of an Ounce of Red-Lead, and the same quantity of Verdigrease, the whole pulverized and sifted fine, which put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a Crucible well closed and luted, in the same Furnace as before, proceeding as in <hi>Chap.</hi> 94, leaving the Crucible in the Fire thirty six Hours. After which, if you will you may cast your melted Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a Marble Mould heated, putting it near the Fire to cool gently, and you'll have a very fine Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald.</p>

Such are the Oriental <hi>Topaz's</hi> which are the most hard of all Stones next the Diamond. Their Colour is like Water tinged with Saffron or Rhubarb, but shining and pure. There are some

               <head>CHAP. CIX. Observations for Pasts and their Colours.</head>
               <p>WE might have inserted this Discourse in <hi>Chap.</hi> 91, as being the first of this Book; but we thought it better to place it here, where we will shew divers ways of making Pasts, no less fair than curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and where it will be necessary to give some lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Instruction to those who undertake to make them, as also concerning the degrees of the Colours that may be therein imitated.</p>
               <p>The making of these Pasts is the essential point of the Business; because on it depends the beauty of our artificial Gems: But the baking also is not of less Consequence, forasmuch as without that you cannot Succeed. It is not Enough to well Regulate the Fire during the time we have Noted in <hi>Chap.</hi> 92. whilst the matter is to stand in the Furnace, but you must also take care that the Crucibles don't break before the matter is well baked and purified: For if the Crucible breaks and you are forced to pour out the matter into another Crucible, the whole Work will be spoiled and the matter full of Pustles and Blisters. You had much better let the Crucible Cool, if it be not quite broken; then Lute it well, and put it in the Furnace again to make an end of baking. You must also take Notice not to break the Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to take out the matter before it be perfectly baked.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:55296:65"/>The curious may avoid these inconveniences, if in room of ordinary Crucibles they make them of the same Earth that the Pots for making Glass are made of, which will resist the Fire longer than we have occasion here for baking, and bear a more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent Fire than we have occasion for.</p>
               <p>Those of Germany also will do very well for this business because they endure the Fire better than the ordinary ones. But I will yet abridge all these precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by shewing an easy way to prepare the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Crucibles, which I have seen tryed, and resist the Fire a long time. Take an ordinary Crucible or rather one of <hi>Germany</hi>: Heat it a little in the Fire, then dip it into Olive Oyl, and let it soak a little of it in. Then take Glass reduced to an impalpable Powder, and strow it all over the Crucible, both without and within, as thick as you can, then put it into a Furnace in a small heat, and then increase the Fire to a melting Heat; then the Glass will Melt and Vitrifie so well with the Crucible, that it will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the Fire far longer than is required for our Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness.</p>
               <p>We will also further remark that the Colours we here shew for Pasts are proportional to the Doses we give them; but those who would have them deeper or lighter, must regulate themselves accordingly: If they make small Stones for Rings, the Colour must be deeper by reason of their smallness: If they make greater, the Colour must be lighter, but deeper for Pendants than any other. The whole depends much on the Fancy of the Workman, who is to propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Doses of the Colouring to the Work he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs.</p>
               <p>In speaking of these Colours in this Chapter, our design is only to shew more easie ways to those who exercise themselves herein, for otherwise we have sufficiently discours'd of them in the precedent
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:55296:66"/>
Chapter, as we shall continue to do in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>We shall say nothing further here of calcined Copper, or Verdigrease, or <hi>Zaffer,</hi> or <hi>Manganese,</hi> having sufficiently done it before; but only adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise the Curious, that there may be extracted from Gold a very fine Red, and one a little more obscure from Iron; an excellent Green from Copper; a Golden Colour from Lead; Blue from Silver, but a much fairer from Granats of <hi>Bohemia</hi>; which are low priz'd by reason of their smallness, but give a very fine Colour.</p>
               <p>The same may be done with Rubies, Sapphire, and other precious Stones, as Chymists well know. If I should treat of all those Colours in this Tract, it would make it half as big again as I design it, and would be too prolix for our present Purpose; what we have shewn already, is sufficient to make very fine Works.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>ISAAC HOLLANDVS</hi> has so well shewn us the way to imitate the Colour of all Precious Stones, that I cannot pass by in silence this following Method of his extracted from his Works. As it is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, nor his Book seen by every one, and that there may be some that cannot understand him, we thought the Reader might be glad to have it, since it is the most curious way that can be made use of for this Work.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:55296:66"/>The way to make his Sulphur for it is this. Take <hi>Ceruss,</hi> or White-Lead, ground very small, put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a great Glass Body, and pour thereon as much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>still'd Vinegar as will rise a Palm above it; and as the Vinegar will rise and swell very much at first pouring on, you must take care to pour it on gently, till all the fury and noise be gone. Then set this Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy on a hot Furnace in Sand, there to evaporate the eighth part of it away. Then let it cool and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant off the remainder of the Vinegar, which will be well coloured and full of Salt, which keep in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Glass Vessel. Then pour fresh distill'd Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar on the remainder of the <hi>Ceruss</hi>; set it again on the Furnace to evaporate as before, and decant off that Vinegar as the former. Reiterate this Process of putting fresh Vinegar on your Matter, and eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porating it, and decanting it off till it have no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Colour nor Sweetness, which commonly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens about the sixth time. Take all your coloured Vinegars, and carefully filter them off, then take one or more Glass Cucurbits, and evaporate all the Vinegars over a gentle Fire, and you'll find re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining at bottom a Salt of <hi>Saturn</hi> of Lead, very White.</p>
               <p>Then take a Glass Matras, lute it well down to the middle of the Body, and put your Salt of Lead in it, and put it on a Sand Furnace over a gentle Fire, for the Space of twenty four Hours, covering it with Sand up to the Neck. Then take out your Salt, which ought to be as red as <hi>Cinnabar,</hi> and grind it fine on a Marble; if it be Yellow, you must put it on the Fire again for twenty four Hours longer, and take care it don't melt, for then all is spoil'd.</p>
               <p>When your Salt of Lead is perfect, as we have shewn, you must put it again into a Glass Cucurbit, and pour distill'd Vinegar on it as before, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant it off when it is enough coloured, and put fresh
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:55296:67"/>
Vinegar on the remaining Salt, and continue this process till all the Salt be dissolved, and the <hi>Faeces</hi> or Dregs all separated. After that, put all these co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured Vinegars into Glass Vessels, and let them stand six Days to settle, then filter them carefully and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate all the <hi>Faeces.</hi> Then put all these filter'd Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars into a great Glass Body to evaporate as before, and you'll find at the bottom a very white Salt of Lead, sweet as Sugar.</p>
               <p>This Salt being well dried, dissolve it afresh in common Water, and let it stand six Days, that all the <hi>Faeces</hi> may precipitate to the bottom. Then filter that Water, and evaporate it in a Glass Cucurbite over a gentle Fire, as we have said, and you'll have at bottom a Salt more white than Snow, and as sweet as Sugar. Reiterate this Method of dissolving in fair Water <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iltering, and evaporating till three times; then take your <hi>Saccharum Saturni,</hi> and put it in a Glass Body in a Sand Furnace over a temperate heat, where leave it for several Days without augmenting the Fire; then it will become redder than <hi>Cinnabar,</hi> and give a Calx finer than Wheaten Flour.</p>
               <p>It is this Calx thus purified from all its Terrestrei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is called Sulphur of <hi>Saturn.</hi> Now in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Pasts for Emerald, Sapphire, Granat, Topaz, Chrysolite, Blue and other Colours; you must em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy it instead of <hi>Minium,</hi> in the same Doses we have shewn in the precedent Chapter of this fifth Book. Observing all we have noted in the Subject of Baking, and proceeding as in <hi>Chap.</hi> 94. Then you'll have Stones of different Colours, far fairer than the Natural ones, and which can scarcely be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished from them.</p>
               <p>The Pasts made with this Sulphur, will not have that Grease and Yellowness which others have, and will not be so apt to spot by the Breath: Upon this account the Curious will have no cause to repent of
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:55296:67"/>
the trouble of making this Sulphur, tho' the Work be very laborious. They also know that all fine Works require very pure Matters, and that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have that purity without the great time and care of those who undertake them.</p>
               <p>I may also here say, that this Work well carried on, is more precious than it seems to be, except to those who are acquainted with it. For the sweetness this Lead has acquired, by the Preparation we have shewn, is a true sign of its Purity, that it is fit to make a Medicine very homogeneous to Nature. I don't say that this Preparation alone, we have here shewn, is sufficient for so elevated a Mystery as that whereof we speak; but I cannot also conceal that it is the chief part of the Work, especially if you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve some little Circumstances which <hi>Isaac Hollandus</hi> has omitted to mention, whether he was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of them, or thought them not necessary to his Preparation, I can't tell. The Learned will easily penetrate into this Mystery, and others that have a true desire to know it, will find Subject to exercise their Wits on, in embracing so serious a Study to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate into the depths of it.</p>

                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:55296:68"/>To do this, take ten Pound of Natural Crystal prepared, with six Pound of Salt extracted from <hi>Polverine</hi> of <hi>Rochetta,</hi> purified, pounded, and well searced, as we have shewn in <hi>Chap.</hi> 7, whereunto add two Pound of Sulphur of <hi>Saturn</hi> chymically prepared, as in the preceding Chapter; then mix these three Powders well together, and put them into an Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then glazed Pan, and cast on them a little common fair Water to reduce these Powders into a Lump something hard. Afterwards divide them into seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Parcels of about three Ounces each, making a hole in the middle the better to dry them at the Sun; being well dry'd, put them into an Earthen Pot well luted, then calcine them in a Potters Furnace, then pound and grind them well on a Marble, and searce them through a fine Sieve. This being done, put this Powder into a Glass Furnace, there to melt and purifie for three Days; then cast the Matter into the Water, as we have elsewhere shewn; and after you have dried it, put it again into the Pot in the same Oven, there to melt and repurifie for fifteen Days, that it may be without spot, and that it becomes of the colour of Precious Stones.</p>
               <p>This Crystalline Matter may be tinged of several Colours, <hi>viz.</hi> Emerald by means of Copper thrice calcined; Topaz by means of prepared <hi>Zaffer</hi>; and so of others whereof we shall not treat here, having largely done it elsewhere. To succeed, you must put into the Furnace as many Pots as you design to make different Colours, add to each as much Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalline Matter as you please, and regulate accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the weight of the tinging Materials which you add to them, and proportionate them to those we have described in the precedent Chapters of this Book. This Paste will have finer Colours than the true Natural Stones, and approach near to their
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:55296:68"/>
hardness; particularly that of the Emerald, which the Curious will find by Experience.</p>

               <p>Take a good Litharge, or rather good <hi>Ceruss</hi> of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> what quantity you please.

               <p>Then take all your coloured Vinegar, rectifie it four times on <hi>Tartar</hi> calcined to Whiteness, then filter it carefully, and put it in a Glass Cucur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite, on a Sand or Ash-Fire, where gently evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate it till it be just skin'd over.

Then put your Vessel on the same Fire to

               <p>THERE are some who use transparent Flints cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cined, to add to <hi>Saturnus Glorificatus,</hi> and make Paste for Artificial Gems; but as we esteem Natural Chrystal prepared much more proper for that Work, we should employ it before calcined Flints.</p>
               <p>Take therefore of Natural Chrystal prepared ten Pounds, of <hi>Saturnus Glorificatus</hi> ten Pounds, the whole reduced to fine Powder, which mix well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; then put it in a Pot in a Glass-house Furnace, there to be melted and purified three Days: Then cast it into a great Wooden Vessel full of cold Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then dry it, and put it in the Furnace in the same Pot, the better to purifie. When this Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalline Matter is well melted, and clear, take out the Pot; and when it is cool, pound it to an impal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable Powder on a Marble, then keep it in a Glass Vessel well stopped, for fear of Dust falling in; and that Matter will serve for a Basis or Stuff to make all sorts of Artificial Gems of.</p>
               <p>We need not here repeat the Way of making them of this Past, because we have shewn it before in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others; but for sake of the Curious who are never weary of Learning, we will do it; besides that there

               <head>CHAP. CXIV. To make a very fair Carbuncle.</head>
               <p>THE Carbuncle is a very Precious Stone, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of several Authors have written, but I don't know one that says he has seen it. They attribute to this Stone the Property of giving Light in the Dark, like a burning Coal, or a kindled Lamp. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovicus Verromannus</hi> reports that the King of <hi>Pegu,</hi> carried one about him of such a bigness, and so much Splendor, that those who saw that Prince when it was Dark, saw him shining as if encircled with the Sun; but this Author, as well as the rest, says he never saw one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pliny</hi> pretends there are several sorts of Carbun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, some Male ones more hard and brighter, and other Females more languid. But this Author is so confused, and so little assured of it, that we cannot take his Testimony as Authentick. Yet among all those Species which he describes, those seem to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach nearest Carbuncles, which he calls <hi>Lithizontes</hi> and <hi>Sandastri.</hi> The first discovers strongly its splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour at the Fire or Sun; being in the Shade it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears of a Purplish Colour; being exposed in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and clear Day, it sparkles as it were at the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams, and hides as it were bright Stars within it. The second is curious by reason of Golden Sparkles ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing and glittering within like Stars, which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways seen across it within side, but never near the Surface, imitating the <hi>Hyades</hi> by their number and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:55296:70"/>
Disposition and Order. This Author says lastly, that the <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> held this last Stone in great Veneration, and used it in all their <hi>Ceremonies.</hi> As for me I am apt to think that the Carbuncle, is that Stone the Ancients have related to give Light by Night like a flaming Fire, and by Day like a twinkling Star, which is now no more to be found as we have hinted in the first Chapter, and that their Carbuncle is the Stone only known to the <hi>Adepti,</hi> the Matter whereof is so pure and Spiritual, that Evil Spirits dare not look on it, much less come near it.</p>
               <p>Whether the Carbuncle be a precious Stone found in the Bowels of the Earth or not, we can imitate the Properties these Authors give it by help of our Art. And we will shew you two Ways of doing it in this Chapter.</p>
               <p>For the first take ten Ounces of Matter prepared with <hi>Saturnus Glorificatus,</hi> and Natural Crystal, redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to impalpable Powder, as we have shewn in the preceding Chapter, whereunto add half an Ounce of <hi>Crocus Martis,</hi> in fine Powder prepared as in <hi>Cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> 27. After having well mixed these Powders together, put them into a good Crucible, which cover and lute well, then put it into a Glass-house Fire for three Days, by putting it nearer and nearer the strength of the Fire by degrees. Then take out your Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and put the Matter into a Marble Mortar, then pound and grind it very small, with its weight of <hi>Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Gemmae,</hi> and put it into another Crucible, which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and lute as before. Being dry, put it into the same Glass-house Furnace, approaching it to the Fire little by little, and letting it stand twenty Hours in good Fusion. Then take it out, and put it again into the Furnace to bake again, as you do Glass, where leave it twelve Hours, that it may cool gently.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:55296:70"/>Your Crucible being cold, take it out of the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace to bake again, then break it, and you'll find in it the Matter tinged of a very fine Carbuncle Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, which you may cut of what Form and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness you please, and then cut and polish them at the Wheel, and they will be perfect.</p>
               <p>There is a certain Slight, which I shall not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here, which several Artists may know, whereby these Carbuncles may be made to undergo all Trials. It is a Point which will deserve the Study of all those who are ignorant of it; to discover it to every one, would be a Profanation of the Secrets of Art, and would make the Ignorant as knowing in one Moment, as those who have employed all their Lives in Sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches after the profoundest Knowledge.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THERE is a second way of making a Carbuncle, called, <hi>Carbunculus nocte illuminans,</hi> which is far more resplendent and fairer than the former. Those who have written that it shone in the Night, and made the Possessors of it always very lucky, only spoke by way of allusion to the Philosophers Stone, to which alone that vertue can be attributed; that is, the Stone and Carbuncle which is not to be found, that is, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in the Hands of the <hi>Adepti,</hi> who alone can make and possess it. We may here boldly say, That the <hi>Carbunculus nocte illuminans,</hi> is not a Stone any where formed by Nature, but made by Art; for Nature cannot purifie the Matters she furnishes us with, and this Stone cannot be made of them, except when
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:55296:71"/>
they are purified in the utmost perfection, which Art alone can do. Thus this Master-piece of Work, this Carbuncle, this Phoenix, or this Stone so famous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Philosophers, is far more precious than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Nature can form, since by means of it, you may in two Hours time make simple Crystals as valuable as any Stones Nature spends so many Ages in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to perfection.</p>
               <p>If there are any Carbuncles in the World, or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones that have their Beauty, we are perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that they must be the products of Art rather than Nature, and that they are only made by that pure and incomparable Matter of the Philosophers, exalted in colour and virtue to the highest degree: We are perswaded by all the Authors we have read, that there is no such Natural Stone; so that there is only the precious Elixir of the <hi>Adepti,</hi> whereof a Stone of the Qualities given to the Carbuncle can be formed, which far surpasses in Beauty, Rubies, Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nats, Jacynths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now we come to the way of imitating this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Carbuncle, or rather the Beauty which Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors attribute to it, not with the <hi>Elixir</hi> of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>depti,</hi> whereof we know nothing but the vertues, but with the ordinary Matters known to all the Students in this Art.</p>
               <p>Take ten Ounces of Matter prepared with Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Crystal, and <hi>Saturnus Glorificatus,</hi> and reduced to an impalpable Powder; add to it an Ounce of Gold calcined, as we shall shew hereafter; then mix the whole well together, and put it in a good Crucible, which must not be above half full, cover it and lute it well, let it dry, then put it into a Glass-house Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace for three Days, by bringing it little by little nearer to the strongest Fire, as we have said before After three Days take out your Crucible, and put the Matter into a Marble Mortar, which pound to
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:55296:71"/>
an impalpable Powder, to which add its weight of <hi>Sal Gem</hi> also in fine Powder, which mix well toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and searce through a fine Sieve, the better to incorporate.</p>
               <p>Put this Powder into a new Crucible, which also fill but half way, which cover, lute, and dry as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: Then put it in the same Glass-house Furnace, bringing it nearer little by little, where let it stand ten Hours. After which take your Crucible out of the Furnace, and put it into that where they set their Glasses to anneal, whence take it out ten or twelve Hours after, and having broken it, you'll find the Matter tinged of a Carbuncle-colour, the most live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and resplendent that can be made by this Art, whereof you may make what Stones or Works you please. We have promised the Calcination of Gold, which may be performed several ways, but as fine Works cannot be made without the most pure Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, we will pretermit the more common ones, to shew you the following, which is very fine and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for this Art. Dissolve an Ounce of Gold in three Ounces of <hi>Aqua Regalis</hi>; then add to it four Ounces of common Mercury purified, and pass'd through Wash-Leather, which will precipitate your Gold to the bottom of the Matras joyning it self to it. Then your <hi>Aqua Regalis</hi> will grow clear, which when it is, and seems to have no more Gold in it, decant it off, then wash your Matter with warm Water to dulcifie it, and take off all the Saltness. Add to this Matter, being dry'd, its weight of Flour of Brimstone, then pound the whole well together, put them in a Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to which fit another on the top, which must be bored on the bottom, with a hole big enough to put a Quill through, which lute well together, and dry them. Then put them in a round Fire, which you must give them by degrees for four Hours, the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible being the last Hour wholly covered over with
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:55296:72"/>
Coals, which let kindle and cool again. Then open the Crucible, and you'll find your Gold calcined, which amalgamate with four Ounces of fresh Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; to which add five Ounces more of Flour of Brimstone, pounding them well together as before, then put the whole in your Crucibles, which lute and give them the same round Fire as before, which reiterate a third time, the better to calcine and open your Gold; then put it into a glazed Earthen Pan, pretty deep, and pour on it good Spirit of Wine that may swim two Inches above, then put Fire to it, and when it is burnt, you'll have a very fine Gold, in an impalpable Calx, well opened, which edulcorate with warm Water distill'd, and dry it gently.</p>
               <p>There is yet another way to calcine Gold more perfectly, by means of which you may make a good <hi>Ceruss,</hi>and afterwards a perfect Vitriol or Salt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Principles may be separated, and you may perform Wonders with them in Medicine and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallick Chymistry; but that Calcination would be too long to describe here, besides it is foreign to our Business, the Gold of that being too much opened.</p>

               <p>THE true Ruby, which is a precious Stone, dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanous and very radiant, ought to have the colour of Blood, and Scarlet, and clear <hi>Lacca,</hi> and shew about the edges of its Fire, a little Azure-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. This Stone is found in the Isle of <hi>Ceilen,</hi> and in the River of <hi>Pegu,</hi> in a Rocky Matter of a Rosie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour, which is the Matrix wherein it is generated
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:55296:72"/>
and nourished; and if that Rocky Matter be transpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, it yields the Balass Ruby, whereof we will treat in the following Chapter.</p>
               <p>Sometimes there are found such fine and large Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies, that some have mistook them for Carbuncles. If any Ruby ever merited that Name, it was that of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> Dowager of <hi>Charles</hi> IX, which after her Death she left to the Emperor <hi>Rodol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> II, her Brother. It had been purchased long before for sixty thousand Ducats, which was then a very considerable Sum.</p>
               <p>Queen <hi>Mary de Medicis</hi> had also one of an inestima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Value, and Bigness, but I cannot learn what the Purchase was, or what became of it.</p>
               <p>To imitate this fine Colour, take four Ounces of our Matter prepared with Natural Crystal, and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnus Glorificatus,</hi> two Ounces of <hi>Crocus Martis</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared as in <hi>Chap.</hi> 25, one Ounce of Verdigrease, two Ounces of Mercury calcin'd <hi>ad rubedinem,</hi> and two Ounces of <hi>Sal-Gem,</hi> the whole reduced to fine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, well mixed together, put into a Crucible cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and luted and set in a Glass-house Furnace for three Days, then take it out and put it in the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace where Glasses are set to Anneal, there to cool by degrees for twelve Hours. Then break your Crucible, and you'll find your Matter tinged of a fine Ruby-colour, which you may divide, cut, and polish, as we have said before.</p>
               <p>We could shew a way of imitating Rubies with only <hi>Orpiment,</hi> which are very fine, but so brittle, that we thought it better to say nothing of it, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than give occasion for an Expence that would turn to no Profit.</p>

They call the first by the Name of the Stone of the Old Rock, and the other by that of the New. The <hi>Turcois</hi> is the finest and noblest of all <hi>Opaque</hi> Precious Stones: Its colour is composed of Green, White and Blue, and imitates that of Verdigrease. They attribute great Properties to this Stone, such as bringing good or evil Luck to People, and to denote things to come to them, either by their breaking or changing Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, which we omit discoursing of, to shew the manner of imitating them.</p>
               <p>Take ten Ounces of our Matter prepared, of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Crystal, and <hi>Saturnus Glorificatus</hi>; half an Ounce of purified Verdigrease, and one Ounce of prepared <hi>Zaffer,</hi> the whole in fine Powder; which mix well together in a Crucible covered with another, well luted and dried, which afterwards put into a Glass-house Furnace, where leave it for three Hours, then twelve Hours in the Annealing Furnace, that it may cool gently.

               </head>
               <p>HERE we give another way of making Precious Stones, different from those we have given be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which will be much harder, and consequently approach nearer the Nature of fine ones, because we employ no <hi>Saturn</hi> therein, which always makes Stones softer and heavier, what Preparation soever you use of it.</p>
               <p>We shall only make use of Natural Crystal, and some Materials added to it, to give it the Colours of all sorts of Precious Stones. We also use in the Composition of the Materials of these Gems, fine and pure Salt of <hi>Tartar</hi> prepared, as in <hi>Chap.</hi> 93, which ought to open our Crystal, and make it the better imbibe the Colour of the Tinctures which we give it, which will make the Stones appear more fine and shining.</p>
               <p>To prepare our Crystal, you must first calcine it, as we have shewn in <hi>Chap.</hi> 92; that is, by heating it
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:55296:75"/>
red hot in a Crucible, and quenching it often in cold Water, changing the Water each time. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of grinding it to an impalpable Powder upon a Marble, as we have shewn in the same Chapter, you must pound it in a Brass Mortar with a Pestle of the same, and not use Iron no more than Marble, then searce the Crystal through a fine Sieve; and this is the Basis of all our following Gems: We should have desired to have put down all our Preparations in one Chapter, since there are only the Doses and the Colours to be changed, the more to abridge this Work; but the fear such a Mixture should breed confusion, obliges us to continue our Work as we have begun it, which is to make a Chapter of each sort of Stone, and of the difference of their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</p>
               <p>After that, we will give the true manner of turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Jargons of <hi>Avernia</hi> into Diamonds, to make Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds of <hi>Alanson,</hi> to harden them, and make them exceeding Sparkling; to give hardness to white and fine <hi>Sapphires</hi>; so that it will be difficult to distinguish them from true Diamonds. Finally we may chance to add something further, for the sake of the Curious.</p>

               <p>WE have promised to treat of the Jargons of <hi>Auvergne,</hi> which are little Stones commonly found in that Country, and several other places of <hi>France:</hi> They are red and shining like <hi>Iacynth</hi>; which has gain'd them the Name of false <hi>Iacynths,</hi> because they much imitate that Precious Stone.</p>

You may give these last a Red Tincture, with as much ease as you can take it away from the former to convert them into Diamonds, as we will shew in the following Chapter.</p>
               <p>To give a Red Colour to Jargons that are of a Gridelin, you must take equal parts of purified <hi>Sal-Armoniac,</hi> and of <hi>Tartar</hi> calcined to Whiteness, as we have otherwise shewn: Mix these Matters well in

               <p>THOSE Stones may be made white and hard like the true Diamonds, by taking away their Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, which is no contemptible Secret. There have been made Rose-Diamonds of them so fine and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that the best Goldsmiths have been mistaken in them, and thought them true Diamonds.</p>
               <p>You must boil your Jargons in a <hi>Balneum</hi> of Mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton-Suet, wherein they will lose all their Red Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and become White.</p>
               <p>Then take equal parts of <hi>Emery</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> Rock-Crystal, Pumice-Stone, and Sulphurous <hi>Trepoly,</hi> the whole reduced into fine Powder, and searced through a fine Sieve, make a Paste of it with <hi>Aqua Vitae,</hi> wherewith cement your Jargons in a great Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible <hi>S. S.

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:55296:80"/>
cool of its self; wherein, after you have broke it, you'll find your Stones of a very fine Diamond Colour, hard, shining, and sparkling like the true ones, which you may polish and work up as the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smiths.</p>
               <p>This Sulphurous <hi>Trepoly,</hi> which enters into the Composition of this Paste, being not commonly known, we will shew the way of making it, that we may leave nothing imperfect, which might be any Obstruction to the Proceedings of the Curious. Take equal parts of <hi>Trepoly,</hi> of crude Antimony and common Sulphur, and grind them to a fine Powder on a Porphyry Stone, and make them into a Paste with Vinegar, which being dry will easily crumble. This is the Sulphurous <hi>Trepoly</hi> which we make use of.</p>
               <p>Some Persons in making the same Process of taking away the colour from Jargons, and giving them the hardness and whiteness of Diamonds, have made use of Barly-meol, wherewith they make a Paste with distill'd Vinegar impregnated with Lead, wherewith they stratifie their Stones, or Jargons, in a Crucible, covered with another, and well luted, which they afterwards put in a gradual, round, or Wheel Fire, for six Hours. But this way they could not give them the true Diamond-colour. Wherefore I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise those who would try this Experiment, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low our first Process, which has several times suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.</p>
               <p>There are moreover some who stratifie their Stones with pounded Coal, which they put in a Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible covered and luted, which they set on the Fire six Hours, so that the Crucible be always red hot. I don't approve of this way, because the Coals may dry the Humour of the Stone, and calcine it.</p>

               <p>THERE is nothing in Nature which Art cannot imitate, and oftentimes those things which seem most difficult, prove to be most easie when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged with Judgment; or when he that undertakes
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:55296:81"/>
to do them has experimented any thing of the like Nature before, and knows the Nature, and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Powers of his Subject.</p>
               <p>Although the Imperfect Metals be immature, or unripe, they contain, notwithstanding, a great deal of fixed and volatile Gold, which may be easily se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, or attracted out by means of Art. Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Metals may be very much meliorated by Fire, by a proportionable and agreeable coction. There are also Crystals and Precious Stones, which have no Natural hardness, which may be given them by Art, having all the Natural Dispositions thereunto requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, since they have the same Principle as the most fine, and that they only want a little Sulphur, which hinder'd their thorough coction.</p>
               <p>Thus this Defect may be obviated in Precious Stones, as well as Metals, by giving them a due coction, and so changing them for the better. We will begin to give the most simple way of attaining it, before we shew those that are more exalted.</p>
               <p>You may give the colour and hardness of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds to Crystals and Diamonds of <hi>Alanson,</hi> by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king good <hi>Dutch Trepoly</hi> and making a Paste of it with Water out of the Smiths Forge, wherein you must wrap up the quantity you design of Crystals, or Diamonds of <hi>Alanson</hi> cut and polished; then set it in a Crucible covered and luted on a gradual Fire, where let it stand till the Crucible become red hot. A little time after take it out, and take out the Stones, then polish them again at the Wheel to give them their colour.</p>
               <p>To set them in Works, take <hi>Indian</hi> Paper, with Leaves of Tin, like those you put behind Looking-glasses, then let them be set by some good Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smith, and they can scarce be distinguished from fine one<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>CRYSTALS also acquire hardness in the Paste we are now going to describe, because their Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity exhales, and they become more fixt.</p>
               <p>Take Barly-Meal well sifted, with <hi>Petroleum,</hi> or Rock-Oyl; then cut that Paste in the middle, and put all your Stones in order, so that they may not touch one another. Then cover your Stones with the other half of the Paste, then put it in a Crucible covered with another, and luted well together, and let it dry. Then set this Crucible in a gradual Wheel-Fire from five to six Hours, a small Fire the two first Hours, which en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THE White <hi>Sapphire</hi> being fine and fixed, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imperfect, by reason of its wanting colour and hardness, which may be remedied by means of Art, and be made to surpass Nature, because she on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>urn it into a true Diamond.</p>
               <p>Only Fire can cause this Effect, in changing its Natural colour, and giving it that of a Diamond. Thus take very fine Sand, wash it in several Waters <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o clean it, till the Water become clear, and then dry it. Of this Sand fill a Crucible half full, then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ut in your <hi>Sapphire,</hi> and fill it up with the same Sand. Then cover your Crucible with a cover of the same Earth, or with another Crucible; lute the whole
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:55296:83"/>
with a good lute, as we have heretofore shewn, lay it on an Inch thick, and let it dry in the shade. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dry, set it in a Glass-house Furnace, approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it nearer the Fire by degrees, and leaving it twelve Hours in the same degree of heat. Then withdraw it little by little for the space of six Hours, and let it cool gently. The Crucible being cold, break it, and you'll find your <hi>Sapphire</hi> within, which will have all the Qualities of a fine Diamond; that is, its shining and hardness. Repolish it at the Wheel, and work it.</p>

               <head>CHAP. CXLV. Another Way of turning the White <hi>Sapphire</hi> into a true Diamond.</head>
               <p>HERE follows another noble Method of convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Sapphire</hi> into a Diamond, which will be easier to those who have not the opportunity of a Glass-house Furnace, for it may be done with a Wind Furnace, in twelve Hours time.</p>
               <p>The Materials we are going to shew, which are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in this Operation, will at first seem very expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive; but if you consider it diminishes not, but you find it all again, you'll easily see, that the only Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence is in the Fire.</p>
               <p>You must therefore begin, by well wrapping your White <hi>Sapphire,</hi> in a thin Iron Plate, that it may be easily managed. Then take fine Gold, purified by <hi>Antimony,</hi> to the highest, put it in a Crucible in a Wind-Furnace, melt it, and when it has a good fine Gloss, put the <hi>Sapphire,</hi> covered with the Iron-Plate, into the Bath, so that it may float on the Gold on
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:55296:83"/>
every side; then give it a strong Fire for twelve Hours, so that the Gold may be all the while in Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. Take out your <hi>Sapphire</hi> with a little pair of Tongues, shaking out the Gold that may chance to stick in the Leaf-Iron; then let it cool by the Fire gently, for fear it should break. Being cold, take away the Plate or Leaf of Iron, and you'll have your <hi>Sapphire</hi> of an admirable. Beauty, it having acquired by that coction all the Qualities and Perfections of the Natural Diamond. Polish it at the Wheel, and Work it.</p>

               <head>CHAP. CXLVI. Another way to turn the White <hi>Sapphire</hi> into a true Diamond.</head>
               <p>THIS Way will be found, by several, to be more easie and better, because it does not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige to such an Expence in Gold, so that People can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not purchase it. This is the Reason we shew it here, tho' others have spoke of it, and among the rest <hi>Ioh. Bapt. de Porta,</hi> who has writ of this Art.</p>
               <p>Take Filings of Iron or Steel, put them in a Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, then put in your White <hi>Sapphire,</hi> so that it may be wholly covered with the Filings: Set the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible in the Furnace, and give it a good Fire, that the Filings may be red hot without melting. After it has been some time in this Fire, take it out with a little pair of Iron-Tongues, to see if it be of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Diamond; if not, put it into the Filings again, and reiterate this till it be perfect.</p>
               <p>You may do the same thing with that filing of Steel, and an equal part of White Enamel in Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Having well mixed them together, put them
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:55296:84"/>
in a Crucible, and put your <hi>Sapphire</hi> in the middle of them; after having first pasted them, with your Powder of Enamel wetted with Spittle, and well dried it at the Fire. When your Matter is red, and it has remained some time in that condition, take out the <hi>Sapphire</hi> with your Tongs, to see if it have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the colour of the Diamond: If it has not, put it in again as before, and continue to do this till it be perfect. Then polish it and work it.</p>
               <p>This is all we design'd to say concerning the Make and Perfections of Gems, tho' there are other ways of doing them, and several other curious things might be said on this Subject; but that would require a large Volume, which perhaps we may do in the next Edition, if we find the Curious take any Satisfaction in this.</p>

               <p>For should we omit this our Intention, the Work would be deficient, and this <hi>Art of Glass</hi> deprived of one of its most excellent and principal Beauties; therefore we propose in the first place, to give di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection for the Choice of <hi>Matter</hi> to be used, and thence shew the Preparations for all sorts, and how to make and suit the Colours most convenient on Enamel.</p>
               <p>The Method not only used by the Goldsmiths, but by such as form Pourtraitures with it of all sorts, as <hi>Man, Beasts, Fowl,</hi> and other Curiosities, very naturally, by a just disposure of the Colours, is most admirable; to effect which no more is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired than a lighted Taper, and a hollow Pipe of Metal for that purpose, to blow the Blaze to the <hi>Matter,</hi> and make it malleable and soft, and thence the several Figures are drawn or impressed thereon.</p>
               <p>And this may be so far improv'd and heightned, as to admit of Performances rather to be thought the Essay of a Divine than Human Artist. Witness that notable <hi>Piece</hi> of <hi>Chariot</hi> drawn by <hi>two Oxen,</hi> of which <hi>Cardan</hi> takes notice in the <hi>fifty second</hi> Chapter of his <hi>tenth Book,</hi> which was so completely done <hi>in Little,</hi> that the whole might be covered with the Wing of a Fly. The <hi>Ship</hi> rigg'd and Man arm'd which <hi>Howel</hi> says he saw. Those little Statues of <hi>Men,</hi> with several other Curiosities of Figure <hi>Vormicus</hi> also as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of. Not to omit the Church of St. <hi>Mark</hi> at <hi>Venice,</hi> where the <hi>Mosaick-Work</hi> is plentifully inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laced with History of all Sorts, distinguishable by the Variety of Colours, and Gildings, and all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of several different Subjects. In short, what Account <hi>Agricola</hi> has left us of these Matters, in his <hi>twelfth Book,</hi> gives us no less cause to admire this Art than he had, when he saw such notable

Pieces of which he makes mention, and which he assures us was deservedly very great.</p>
               <p>The use of <hi>Enamel</hi> is very ancient, however that of working on Metal is more modern; and for the great Perfection to which it is arrived, we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to this present Age, as we shall further shew in the <hi>Seventh Book,</hi> where we will also endeavour to discover further, and make greater Improvements therein.</p>

               <p>Take <hi>Lead</hi> in Piggs thirty pound, <hi>Plate-Tin</hi> of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> thirty three pounds; mix and calcine them as directed for <hi>Lead</hi> in <hi>Chap.</hi> LXXXI. pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely observing the Directions there laid down. This done, fearce the <hi>Calx,</hi> and put it all into a glazed Earthen Pot, fill'd with Water, put it over a fire, and let it boil a little; then take it off, and pour the Water gently into another Vessel, which will carry along with it the more <hi>subtile Calx.</hi> Repeat this until no more of the <hi>Calx</hi> can be subtiliz'd; which you may discover by the Pureness of the Water in pouring it out of one Vessel into the other. After this calcine the <hi>Remains</hi> of what is in the first Pot, as before, and thus continue to calcine and subtilizetill you can get no more of the <hi>subtile Calx.</hi> Lastly, put the Waters out of all your Receivers into larger, and set it on a slow Fire to evaporate. The Fire must be very gentle for this Reason, that the <hi>Calx</hi> do
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:55296:87"/>
not founder or fall to the bottom, but continue more fine and subtile, than when it was first calcin'd.</p>
               <p>Your <hi>Calx</hi> being thus prepared, take thereof about fifty pound, and as much <hi>Fritt</hi> of white <hi>Tarso</hi> beaten and searced, as directed <hi>Chap.</hi> VI. To these add eight Ounces of Salt of <hi>Tartar,</hi> finely searced and prepared as in <hi>Chap.</hi> XV. Mix all these Powders very well together in a Pot, and let it stand in the Glass-house Furnace or Oven about ten hours to digest and purifie. Then take them out, and reducing them to an impalpable Powder, keep it in a close dry place for use. Thus must your Matter for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namel be prepared to receive the Colours, but of that more hereafter.</p>

be done in a little time. The Matter being thus melted, take it out of the Pot, and throw it into very fair Water, and being afterwards dryed, put it again into the Pot to melt; do thus with it thrice, changing the Water. When you have thus purified it, if you find it justly white, 'tis good; but if it be greenish, add a little more <hi>Magnese,</hi> and 'twill become white as Milk, and fit Enamel for Gold, or other Metal. Take it off the Fire, and make it up into Cakes, and keep them for use.</p>

               <p>You may make Enamel of this Colour with four pound of our <hi>principal</hi> prepared <hi>Powder</hi> in Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter CXLVIII. two Ounces of prepared <hi>Zaffer,</hi> forty eight Grains of <hi>Copper</hi> thrice calcined, mentioned in the precedent Chapter; these reduc'd to a mixt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palpable Powder, must be put into a white glazed Pot; when the Metal is well melted, cast it into Water, and when 'tis dry return it to the Pot; after that let it stand upon the Fire until it be well digested and incorporate: Then take it off, and you have a very fine Enamel for Goldsmiths, which make into Cakes, and keep for use, as before.</p>

               <p>Make strong Lye of Quick-Lime and harsh Oak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Ashes, put therein Flowers of Sulphur until the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid Surface be four Inches upmost; boil it for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable while over the Fire, this will cleanse and purge the Sulphur from its Unctuosity and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and qualifie it for your purpose; separate the Lye from the Sulphur, and drying it, you'll have it white, fixt, and incombustible, exceeding proper for the Goldsmiths to make use of on Gold.</p>
               <p>We cou'd prescribe several ways more to make Sulphur fixt and fusible, but these two already given are sufficient for our purpose; we reserve them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for some other place to be discovered among Matters more excellent, and of greater Curiosity, for the Advantage of such Persons who Study the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement and profounder parts of <hi>Chimistry.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. CLXVII. To Extract Spirit of <hi>Saturn,</hi> an Excellent Ingredient for Enamel and Glass-work.</head>
               <p>WE think fit to propose all the Preparations pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for making a Red Enamel, before we shew the way to make it, because the Ingredients to
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:55296:95"/>
be used must first be provided, or we can't proceed regularly to our Business.</p>
               <p>Among the rest, this Spirit of <hi>Saturn</hi> is not to be laid aside, which tho considered here as useful only in Enamel and Glass-work, may have other Vertues familiar to the Learned; but for our Business 'tis such as does very nobly heighten and much improve the Matter for our Work, and for any other not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately relating to us here, we pass over in silence.</p>
               <p>Reduce good Litharge, as much as you please, to an impalpable powder, and set it in a glazed Earthen Vessel over a still Fire; add to this good distilled Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, till four Inches above it, mix 'em well toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and then let them settle until the Vinegar be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Milk-coloured, which will be in a little time; decant this Vinegar off gently, and put on fresh, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing to do thus until it admits of no more colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; then put all the Milk-coloured Vinegar into a glazed Earthen Vessel, and let it stand until the Lead precipitate to the bottom; from whence pour of the clear Vinegar, which will be at top, and that Milk-coulour'd Sediment which remains, is what we call Spirit of <hi>Saturn,</hi> tho improperly, and that which we'll make use of for the Enamel and Glass.</p>
               <p>If it do not precipitate well to your liking, and that the Vinegar at top be not very clear, cast among it some cold Water; if that won't do, and that your Vinegar still continues muddy, set all the Water and Vinegar together over a gentle Fire to evaporate, and thus you'll have the more Spirituous part of your Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar a Sediment in the bottom of the Vessel, which is exceeding useful for Glass-work; keep it together with the rest of the <hi>Saturn</hi> for use.</p>
               <p>This Noble Preparation which we call Spirit of <hi>Saturn,</hi> does indeed contain it, but you must have skill to extract it thereout; to say that 'tis all Spirit of <hi>Saturn</hi> is untrue, for 'tis that wherein the Spirit
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:55296:95"/>
is contained, and from whence it may be more easily and better separated, than from the Mass of Lead, I propose this first step towards extracting it as such, whereby the Curious may succeed with small trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:55296:98"/>
will be of a wonderful fine Beauty, as has been often experimented. Now the whole Secret of this Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration consists in calcining the Gold perfectly, and bringing it to an absolute and just fineness, which must create this precious Colour.</p>
               <p>Take very pure Gold, and for the better assurance refine it your self, and dissolve an Ounce of it in three Ounces of <hi>Aqua Regalis,</hi> as directed in <hi>Chap.</hi> 55. let the Solution distil over a gentle Fire until the Gold precipitates, and thus repeat an Exhalation and Cohobation six times, and the last time take out the Gold, powder and put it into a Crucible covered and luted, on a Reverberatory to calcine; let it remain until it become of a very excellent and Scarlet Red, which will not be without a considerable allowance of many Hours.</p>
               <p>This done, take of our Crystal ground, and melt a quantity of it in a glazed Pot at the Furnace of the Glass-house, and being well purged, throw in a twentieth part of the Powder of Gold, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as the quantity of Metal, stirring the whole ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well, let it alone for some time, then try it, and according as you find the Colour, put in more Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der until you bring it to a true transparent Carbun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle-colour.</p>
               <p>We have given another way to calcine Gold in <hi>Chap.</hi> 115. no less sufficient than this, together with a way to make a fine Carbuncle, and this rare Colour may as well be given to the Stone as the Enamel by the Directions for preparing the Gold in either Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Curious may choose which they will, they being equally sufficient.</p>

               <head>CHAP. CLXXVI. The Way to calcine Copper for making <hi>Vitriol</hi> of <hi>Venus,</hi> without Corrosive.</head>
               <p>WE promised in <hi>Chap.</hi> 45. to shew this fine Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say, which is certainly the Noblest Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can be made of Copper, so the Learned may take notice of it: If the <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> of <hi>Vitriol</hi> has many excellent Vertues for tinging of Glass, this <hi>Vitriol</hi> it self, or rather Spirit, must have far greater and more extraordinary in Matters of a more sublime Nature: A famous Philosopher, very eminently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendable and Judicous, was never weary of dwelling on the Praise of this hidden Treasure, and extolling its Vertues to the highest.</p>
               <p>Tho this Vertue be known to many of the Learned, yet we may boldly say, 'tis unknown to very many indifferently so, who as soon as they have run over the Writings of some Sage Virtuoso, pretend to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with all the Secrets of Nature, and which they undertake to disclose and unravel as soon as they can force 'em to any sense comformable to their weak Capacity, tho never so different from the Author's meaning, to which they are altogether Strangers, and this gives us Authority enough to condemn them for truly ignorant.</p>
               <p>Nature is veiled, and her Vertues not so plainly disclosed to all the World, she has those secret Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluses for them as can be opened by no other than her own Key, which can't be match'd, and therefore not to be found in the Hands of every Man; besides that, one must be lead by the same Genius as he that forged it, before one can truly find and distinguish it, and
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:55296:99"/>
we may assure our selves that none but the Wise are in possession of this rare and precious Treasure.</p>
               <p>The greatest of those who have writ on this Art, have always held this Key as the last Secret; all the profound Arguments they have alledged, and Pains they have been at to screen those obscure Avenues, were designed to make them inaccessible to the Base and Unworthy, and preserve these All-Divine Secrets from being prophaned by the Hands of such as wou'd abuse them.</p>
               <p>This Sacred Mystery does not only consist (as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fansie) in the making of Gold and Silver, which is Ambitiously suggested by the meer Avarice of the major part of all Mankind, but is indeed the meanest Excellency thereof; for Health, which it contains, is beyond all the Treasure in the World; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, the Knowledge it affords us of an Omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the true God, and of all the other Most Holy Mysteries of Religion, wherein it gives an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to make a perfect Discovery: Are not those much more sublime and eminent Vertues which lead us to a Blessed Eternity? Whereas on the contrary, all the Transitory Wealth on Earth has nothing in it but Imposture, and serves only to precipitate us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Bottomless-Pit.</p>
               <p>We'll leave this lofty Subject to be discoursed on by the Learned, and go on to the calcining of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which is the first Preparation to be made in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the <hi>Vitriol</hi> of <hi>Venus</hi> without Corrosive, which is known to very few, and whereof we have already given an Elogy.</p>
               <p>Take thin Leaves of red Copper, and put them into Crucibles, stratifying 'em lay upon lay with Powder of common Sulphur, filling your Crucibles until all the Copper Leaves be put in, as in <hi>Chap.</hi> 22. then cover well and lute the Crucibles, let the lute dry, and put them into the Furnace of <hi>Chap.</hi> 52. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:55296:100"/>
a good Charcoal-Fire for two Hours; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards let them stand and cool, then take off the Crucibles, and you'll find your Copper calcin'd and blackish, inclining to a deep Purple Powder; searce it, and to each Pound add six Ounces of Powder of Sulphur, mix and put them into a round flat-bottom Earthen Pot, strong enough to bear the Fire, lay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Furnace a strong Earthen-Dish, fill it with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry live Coals, and place your Pot thereon with the Copper; when the Pot grows hot, and the Sulphur takes Fire, stirring it with your long Iron Crook, lest it should stick to the Pot, or become concrete, continue thus till the Sulphur be all consumed and smoaks no more; take the Pot hot off the Fire, and empty the Copper out with an Iron-Ladle; pound it well in a Brass Mortar, and searce it all finely, and you'll have a blackish Powder, reiterate this Calcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thrice, with the like proportion of Sulphur as before, and the third time let it remain until the Copper become Red and Yellow; then take it off, and pound it in a Brass-Mortar, and searce it finely, pounding what remains over again, untill all be sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and you'll have a very well coloured <hi>Calx</hi> of Copper, most effectual and proper for extracting this fair <hi>Vitriol</hi> of Copper, whereof we will give the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration in the next Chapter.</p>

               <p>Take all these Sediments, and to each Pound add six Ounces of Powder of Sulphur as before, putting it into your flat-bottom'd Earthen Pot to calcine as in the former Chapter; take care to stir it well as long as the Sulphur fumes, and it stands over the Fire, else it will stick to the Pot and not calcine; take it off and powder it immediately in a Brass-Mortar, searce the Powder, and you'll find it black; mix this again with Sulphur proportionably six Ounces to a Pound, and put it to calcine anew, stirring it very well as before directed; let it stand a while on the Fire to alter the Matter from a Russet to a Yellow; then take it off and pound it instantly in a Brass-Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar before it cool, and then searce it all finely over.</p>

three Pound of the Tincture to evaporate gently, and put the rest into Glass-Bottles set round your Furnace, so that they may be heated, and ready to fill the Cucurbit as fast as the Exhalation consumes its Tincture, which may be done with a Glass Ladle, or the Bottles themselves, lest the Waters being cold might cause the Cucurbit to burst, and so all would be lost.</p>
               <p>Reduce ten Pound of this by evaporation to two and half, or three at most, which will be a very high Tincture, pour it into two or three glazed Earthen Vessels, and place them all Night in a moist cold place, and you'll find the <hi>Vitriol</hi> at bottom, and stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the sides of the Vessels, like little long Icicles, which will have the true colour of Oriental Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds, pour all the remaining Waters into the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curbit, and dry the <hi>Vitriol</hi> that it may not stick, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving it in a close Vessel.</p>
               <p>Place your Cucurbit again on the Furnace to eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate anew at the consumption of half the Waters, and crystalize the strong Tincture as before. Thus whilst any Water remains evaporate and crystalize until all be consumed, to the end that none of this may be lost, whose Vertues are infinitely useful, not only in <hi>the Art of Glass,</hi> and the <hi>Metallick,</hi> but in <hi>Physick</hi> too, for the curing of many Chronick Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers, which we pass over in silence, as foreign to our Subject, and continue to prescribe the rest of this rare Work, to conceal nothing from the Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but give them entire satisfaction.</p>

               <p>We were mistaken in <hi>Chap.</hi> 45. in saying that the <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> must be exposed to the Air before you do pound it with the <hi>Zaffer,</hi> for that is not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether incumbent in tinging of Glass, tho this expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of it cannot but add something to the lustre, for it draws thereby with a certain Magnetick Property, the occult Spirit of the Air, and so from a Black, of which it was before, becomes of a pale Blue-colour, and partly assumes what it lost by Distillation and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of the Spirits, so you may save a great deal of time and pains by this Preparation, to your no small Advantage, in expediting the Matter.</p>
               <p>Such as shall comprehend the Vertues of those things we have shewn in the four last Capters, ought to be secret, for many will read these things, and not apprehend, or only Laugh at them, whether it be that the Divine Power, for Reasons best known to himself, will not let them discern, or that they confide in a false Presumption on their own Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as beyond all other Mens. God has neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less not confined to one only Wit, the whole Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or all the sublime Excellencies of Nature, but on the contrary, to declare his great and unbounded Charity, permits it to be communicated to many for his greater Manifestation and Glory; yet he reserves those more important Secrets to be revealed to his Faithful Servants, that such as would be acquainted with the same Mysteries, may apply to this Father of Light, who alone can inspire them with sufficiency enough for penetrating into these which they could never do without his Assistance.</p>
               <p>Now the true Method thereof is obvious to all the World, a Holy and Regular Life opens the Passage, and continual Study and Application guides us

through; but we must add to these an upright Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of making good use hereof, that we may not wander; a Love for our Neighbour conformable to the Will of God, to bring us to a safe Port, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Charity to the Poor, to lay open for us the Gate of Heaven; and in a Word, an unlimited and immense Love for this <hi>Omnipotent Creator, Eternal, and Incomprehensible,</hi> to Hand us to his very Throne: This is the prevailing Attractive, which all the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Philosophers made use of to draw down this Divine Intelligence, and which I most heartily wish to all that would imitate them.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:55296:104"/>The Ancient Works of Enamel on Metals, were only of Black and White, with some few Tinges of Carnation, or Flesh-colour, as may be seen in the <hi>Limoge</hi> Enamel; in <hi>Francis</hi> the First's Time it became more improv'd, and they made use of <hi>Lights</hi> and <hi>Shadows</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the Enamel on Gold was of no better Stuff than that on Copper, and all the Works of it on Gold, Silver, and Copper, were of Transparent Matter; such as wrought it on thick, couched each Colour by it self, as is done now a Days in Enamel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some particular Pieces of <hi>Relief,</hi> and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
               <p>Since then they have found out the way of Ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meling with opaque, and thick stuff, and the Art of compounding the Colours, is much more improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and handsomer than that of the Ancients, as is visible in all our Modern Works; but we must with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Exception, own the fair Works upon Gold, representing Pourtraitures, and entire Histories, so neatly, and to the Life, and coveted as much as Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture done in Oyl, over which it has the advantage of Natural Lustre and Varnish, which is never tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, to be the Invention of this latter Age, and the Improvements we owe to the Study of the <hi>French</hi> therein.</p>
               <p>All sorts of Enamel are not to be promiscuously employed on all sorts of Metal; Gold which perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bears with as well all the Opaque as Transparent, cannot agree with clear Purple, its Yellow mightily changing the Colour thereof, and produces but a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ill Fancy; on the other side, this Purple is very fine on Silver; so the Egmarine, the Azure, and Green all other Colours, as well clear as Opaque, disagreeing therewith, and Copper suits with every thick Enamel, but cannot endure the Limpid, unless prepared for it beforehand, as shall be directed in due place.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:55296:105"/>Observe that good Enamel must be hard and lasting, such as is soft being full of Lead, and subject to change Colour, easily becoming sullied and foul; of the clear Enamel some is harder, some softer; the hardest is always best, however even of them there is choice; some lose colour in the Fire, some are more or less lively and sparkling, but if you em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy constantly such as we have prescribed in our <hi>Sixth Book,</hi> you'll never be exposed to those Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies; for the Ingredients being perfectly clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, will endure all degrees of Fire, any change of Colour or Quality not ensuing.</p>

               <p>THE Enameling of Metals, as well as the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring of the Stuff, cannot be effected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Fire, and is wholly different in this point from Painting with the usual Colours in Oyl, which may be dried in the Air only, without other help.</p>
               <p>It would be very hard to believe the Fire would not spoil the mixture of the Colours, if our daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience which we made, did not vouch the contrary; however care must be taken not to let the Work have too much time, but draw it out as soon as you find it polisht.</p>
               <p>The Fire must be Reverberatory, or rather of Suppression, and never to be under the Stuff; 'tis the same as is used for cleansing of Metals, whether in Mints or Goldsmiths Shops, which is very familiar to all the World.</p>

               </head>
               <p>WE have already said, that Gold, Silver, and Red Copper may be Enamel'd; now to make true Work, you must use only pure Gold, because Silver makes White Enamel appear Yellow, and Copper rises in Scales, and makes Vapours; for tho all Enamel sticks to it, yet it is but very imperfectly,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:55296:107"/>
and may be easily divided and peeled off again; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, the Colours are so wretched on it, and lose much of their Charm and Lustre by the Impurity of that Metal.</p>
               <p>Therefore, if you would have good Work, let Gold only be your Subject, and of the purest, if you employ clear Enamel, because on impure Gold they grow dull, and become imperfect, that is to say, there appears with this a certain obscure and Cloudy Vapour in the Enamel, which deadens and takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Life of its Colour.</p>
               <p>The Gold Plate ought to be rising, and when it is forged very even, the Goldsmiths apply white Ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel over and under it, tho it is to be wrought but on one side, but this is necessary for two Reasons: First, Because the Work is neater and fairer for it: And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, Because if it were only Enamel'd on one side, the Fire would swell it, and so make it rise, and that in Bubbles; because it is always as it were torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, especially when the Pieces are great, and the Enamel carelesly laid on; this makes it produce Bli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterings, which disfigure the Work; the <hi>French</hi> Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists call such <hi>Vegoter,</hi> but their Goldsmiths <hi>Petits Ocuillets:</hi> This disfiguring of the Work, you may avoid, by laying Enamel on both sides of the Plate of Gold, and thicker over than under, this will keep it equal and even on both sides, the first lay of White Enamel remaining / smooth in this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, serves for a Field to place all your other Colours on as we will further discourse of in the Art of Pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying.</p>
               <p>Oyl of <hi>Spike</hi> is used for dissolving thick and opaque Enamel before it can be applied; for the Transpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent you need use nothing but fair Water, as we shall shew in <hi>Chap.</hi> 185. and then 'tis couched flat and bordered with the Metal, and sometimes we don't border at all, the Field being all Enamel, but this is

               <p>Red Enamels are not so, unless by chance, and come generally Yellowish out of the Fire; assoon as 'tis ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Gold, it alters the Colour; one may soon bring it to a perfect Red Enamel, by turning it at the Mouth of your Furnace, when you are taking it out from the Fire; and then it is that the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men say they make it Red, and give it its compleat Colour.</p>
               <p>Gold, as we have already said, admits of all sorts of Enamel, clear or opaque, bright Purple excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which is altered by the Yellow-colour of the Gold, and does not take so good effect there, as on Silver, on which it ought still to be used. The Way of working every sort of Enamel, is alike; not to make any useless Repetitions, we will satisfie our selves only to advise you to employ all those Ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels prescribed in the <hi>Sixth Book,</hi> which have every illustrating and convenient Property to be wished for in this Work.</p>

               </head>
               <p>WE have already taken notice in our former Chapter, that Silver agrees not with all sorts of Enamel, as Gold. We repeat it here again to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the use of any but such as serve to produce per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and agreeable Effects.</p>
               <p>You are to make least use of White Enamel on Silver, because there it becomes Yellowish, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:55296:108"/>
but nothing can suit better with it, than bright Purple, Green, Blue, and Egmarine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Whiteness of the Silver is then clearly emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and gives its just splendour.</p>
               <p>The Work and manner of Enameling on Silver, is no way different from that of Gold, in forging the Plates evenly to prepare 'em for the Enamel, you may make use of White on the under side, since the Enamel there serves only to qualifie the Risings and Disturbings of the Metal in the Furnace, which would cause unevenness, or disagreements in the surface, and prevent its becoming just and handsome.</p>
               <p>We need not repeat again that way of placing the Enamel on your Plates of Gold or Silver, and so to put them into your little reverberatory Furnace spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in <hi>Chap.</hi> 181. to melt, and as soon as polished to be taken from the Fire.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THO we have before touched upon the way of Enameling on Copper, yet lest the Reader should too slightly apprehend it, as not in order, or a distinct Chapter, therefore we are obliged to enter it here to avoid Imperfection.</p>
               <p>The less use is made of this Metal in this Work the better, for the Enamel never sticks to it perfectly, but is easily scaled, divided, and broke off, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver happens to Gold; besides, the Copper is so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, that its Fumes destroy the Beauty of the Ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel so much in the Furnace, that they quite lose their Charm and Splendour by the Malignity of those Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:55296:108"/>Tho the Copper receives easily all thick or dark Enamels, it can't be brought so well to endure the clear and limpid; now if you would make use of these last, you must first lay a lay of Green, or Black, and thereon a Leaf of Silver to receive the Enamel suitable for that Metal mentioned in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Chapter; so that in the main 'tis much better to make use of Silver for the Transparent Enamels, since the Copper is so apt to foul, and the charge in either much the same.</p>
               <p>In Enameling on Copper, you must take a Plate of red Copper forged smooth, and even applying your Enamel of what Colour you desire above and under the Plate as before; then put this into the reverbera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Furnace, and when it receives its polishing, draw it out.</p>

               </head>
               <p>BEFORE you apply your Enamel on the Metal, you must give it this little Preparation, which is the easiest, and best approv'd on by the Goldsmith; we will instance it in White Enamel, because that is more generally made use of than any other.</p>
               <p>Take White Enamel of the <hi>Sixth Book, Chap.</hi> 149. pulverize it very fine, pour on it a little <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and let it afterwards purifie and refine in a small Glass Cucurbit.</p>
               <p>Wash it afterwards often in Fair-Water, dry and keep it in a close Vessel for use.</p>
               <p>To make use of it, first pound a quantity thereof in a Stone Mortar, wetting it with a little Water, and so spread it on the Plates, and into the Furnace with it as before.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:55296:109"/>Thus do with all your clear and transparent Ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels, and you'll have all your things in a readiness to go on with your Work as you think convenient.</p>

               </head>
               <p>NOTHING can be more splendid than the Paint on Enamel, and for this use must be chosen the liveliest and most Noble Colours, and such as will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily vitrifie and melt.</p>
               <p>All these assigned throughout the <hi>Sixth Book,</hi> are as equally sufficient for this, as for Enameling; if you grind them first on your Marble with the best Oyl of <hi>Spike,</hi> or mix'em together with the other Ingredients for that purpose, as we shall give a fuller account in the next Chapter, and of all the Matters to be used with calcined Enamels, which serve to make up the Paint for Enamel mixing them well together as Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters do on their Pallets: When you want some Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of Enamel, you may with Blue and Yellow make a good fair Green; a Blue and Red mixt, will produce a fine Violet; a Red and White creates a Rose-colour; a Black and White forms a gallant Gray, and so of others.</p>
               <p>Every Workman has his own Secret, and peculiar way of Working, but most of them make use of <hi>Rocaille</hi> for varnishing their Colours, which has an ill effect, because of too much Lead, which is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly purged off; this lessens the Life and Splendour, and it always continues as it were tarnished, cloudy, and dull.</p>
               <p>But our Enamel being well refined, will produce Work so fine and agreeable, that 'tis not possible to
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:55296:109"/>
find any thing so illustrious and accomplisht; and such as for their one private diversion, would work herein, and have not the conveniency of a Glass-house, may easily be furnished, by proceeding to make one according to the directions already given.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding the sufficiency of our Enamel for affording all sorts of Colours and Tinges in painting on Enamel, we will yet prescribe other means for this, no way inferiour thereto, to answer the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and Curiosity of those who Work at this Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Art.</p>

               </p>

               <p>You may because it is vetrified, make another fine enough Blue thus.

               <head>CHAP. CXCI. A <hi>Red</hi> Paint for Enamel.</head>
               <p>THere can nothing exceed the Perfection of our <hi>Enamels</hi> of this Colour, taught in eight several Chapters of the <hi>Sixth Book</hi>; the like may be said of our <hi>Blood-colour, Rubies, Rose</hi> and <hi>Carbuncle,</hi> which is the most exalted Ingredient for <hi>Enameling</hi> Metal, or making Paint on <hi>Enamel</hi>; and those who practise this fine Art, use no other than that of the Glass-house, or such as they make accordingly. Now this <hi>Red Enamel</hi> is prepared as the other Colours with <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortis</hi> to purifie it, wash'd, dry'd, and ground with Oyl of <hi>Spike</hi> for your use.</p>
               <p>There is yet another tolerable Red, which they Paint with on <hi>Enamel,</hi> in which is employed calcined Gold; but this would be much more improved, if instead of their <hi>Rocaille</hi> they made use of our Matter made of Crystal and <hi>Saturnus Glorificatus</hi> in <hi>Chap.</hi> 113. or of our principal prepared Powder prescribed all along the <hi>Sixth Book,</hi> for these are exceeding well pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, whereas the <hi>Rocaille</hi> has too great a Surcharge of Lead, the Impurity whereof always renders the Work defective.</p>
               <p>See here their way of calcining Gold, which is not near so fine as that we have given <hi>Chap.</hi> 115. and as there are an hundred several ways, so every Man makes use of his own as most excellent, and thinks it better than another's.</p>
               <p>One takes an Ounce of fine Gold in very thin Plates, these dissolved in eight Ounces of <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> and regulated with <hi>Sal-Armoniack,</hi> or old strong Salt, in a small Glass Matrass, this is put into a Glass-Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curbit,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:55296:111"/>
wherein was already pour'd eight <hi>Paris</hi> Pints of Spring-Water, and six Ounces of <hi>Mercury,</hi> the Cucurbit is placed on a still Fire, and after four and twenty Hours the Gold descends to the bottom in a light Land-red Powder, then the Water is poured off leisurely into an earthen glazed Receiver, or Pan, and the Powder gathered and dryed by a moderate heat, and with a <hi>Shamois</hi> Skin they separate the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> from the Gold, and grind this Powder with twice its weight of Flowers of <hi>Sulphur</hi> together, and then put all into a Crucible over a small Fire, where the Sulphur will communicate it self with the rest, and then evaporating they find the Powder somewhat ruddy, which ground with <hi>Rocaille,</hi> is what they make use of on the <hi>Enamel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We own this Calcination to be tolerable as to the Gold, but as for mixing the <hi>Calx</hi> with the <hi>Rocaille,</hi> without melting them together to incorporate is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable: We believe that in grinding them together with Oyl of <hi>Spike,</hi> they may in some sort incorporate as other Colours, but can never so perfectly unite; besides, the Crystal Matter does not so well receive the Colour of the Gold this way, as if it were done by fusion.</p>
               <p>Others make Red inclining to Vermilion, which they use in Painting after this manner. Take Vitriol calcined in two Crucibles well luted together, and set for an Hour over a flow Fire; then purge it with <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> wash it in fair Water, and grind it with Oyl of <hi>Spike</hi> as before, and so make use of it for <hi>Ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All <hi>Red Enamel</hi> which is good, ought to be hard, and not easily consumed in the Fire; for that which is otherwise, contains much Lead, and soon becomes dull and sullied, and is not of so lasting a substance, which the Workmen ought to be cautious of.</p>

               <head>CHAP. CXCII. The Way to Paint on Enamel.</head>
               <p>THIS Art is revered by all Nations, 'tis so fine and so excellent, that the first and Noblest Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the World practise in it, as we have said elsewhere: It is certain that the Art of painting on Enamel is modern, but no less estimable for that, since its effects are so wonderfully beautiful, so infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely lasting, of so Natural a Gloss, and their Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour never to be defaced.</p>
               <p>If it were possible to make large Works of Enamel, as is done in Picture, they would be inestimable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of their Lustre, and so far surpass what Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity has had such great respect for, and which these latter Ages still caress with extraordinary esteem.</p>
               <p>This way of painting on Enamel, seems much more difficult than Limning; Practice however convinces us, that they are equally easie, and we can with as little trouble represent any History on Enamel, as in Limning; the difference lies only in preparing the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:55296:112"/>
Colours, which is not done the same way; for we dry and varnish our Enamel-paint by Fire, whereas that in Limning is done by the Air.</p>
               <p>To paint on Enamel, you must have a Plate of Gold enamel'd with White, on which delineate and pourtray your Design. This done, draw it over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in dark Red: The Piece being perfectly done off, and the Lines compleat to the Subject, set the Tablet, or Piece in the Muffle, on a reverberatory Fire, to settle as before directed.</p>
               <p>Your Tablet being taken out, apply the Colours in a just order as in Limning, with this difference on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that here you make your White Ground serve for filling, where that Colour is required to set off the heightnings and lustre of the <hi>Lights</hi> as is done in Miniature; and because it mightily contributes to the heightening thereof in the other Colours as to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving their <hi>Lights,</hi> we have given a most excellent Receipt in <hi>Chap.</hi> 187. which very excellently serves upon this occasion.</p>
               <p>When the Piece is thus finished, put it again into the Furnace to fix the Colours, and as soon as you perceive it varnish or polish, draw it out least the Colours mix and spoil each other.</p>
               <p>You may take out the Work again, and revise it as often as you please, only putting it still into the Furnace until it receives its just Gloss, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This way of renewing and revising the Tables, is done in Limning with Oyl; and the Painters observe that the Pieces must not be handled until they are well dry'd in the Air, so those in Enamel must be let alone until they receive their perfection from the Fire.</p>
               <p>This is all to be observed in Painting on Enamel; it remains only for us to shew how to prepare your dark Red for tracing the Design; you may have it thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:55296:113"/>Take the <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> which remains in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort, after the <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> is made of your <hi>Vitriol</hi> and <hi>Nitre,</hi> grind it with Oyl of <hi>Spike,</hi> and so you have the dark Red ready for your use; or you may make it with <hi>Crocus Martis,</hi> ground with Oyl of <hi>Spike.</hi>

               <p>And as the Secrets of Nature are daily more and more discovered, so has time employed the Invention of Man to improve this, and make it more excellent, not only condescending to enameling, but proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing also to Painting and pourtraying thereon several Curiosities, to which at length is added the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Gilding.</p>

               </head>
               <p>MUST be large, with an <hi>Opening</hi> proportioned to the Vessel you are to place therein; of these there are several sorts, but the most commodious must be made as follows.</p>
               <p>You may shape this Furnace round or square, but the square is best, because of the <hi>Opening</hi>; it must be made of good Brick and such Stuff as can mostly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the Fire, of what bigness you please, with three Divisions; the lowest for the Ashes must be a Foot high, that the Air may be communicated through its <hi>Opening</hi> to the Fire; the middle Story is for the Fire, and must be underlaid with a very good Grate to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate it from the under Story, with an <hi>Opening</hi> for the Fuel, and be vaulted above about a Foot in heighth: According to the Size of your Furnace this Vault must be made like that of an Oven, and have an Hole in the middle of the same shape as the Furnace, round or square, and proportioned to its bigness, through which the Flame may transmit it self to the uppermost Story, where the Vessels are put to bake in; this last Story is to be at least two Foot high, and its Opening fourteen or fifteen Inches, to put and draw the Vessels easily in and out; the top must be vaulted too with such a round or square hole, and over that a Funnel, for the conveniency of the Flame and Smoak which it draws out.</p>
               <p>All the Opening, especially the two uppermost, must be of strong Brick, or Crucible Earth, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Iron, well luted within side, which must shut and open easily, and be very exact and sit, that the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:55296:115"/>
Fire may not suck in any cold Air, which might break the Vessels.</p>
               <p>This Furnace will serve also for many other uses, as to Melt, Reverberate, Calcine, Cement, and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral sorts of Works in the Laboratory of <hi>Chimistry</hi>; because in it all the degrees of Fire may be found by the help of the lower Opening, and the Funnel of the Chimney.</p>
               <p>You may else for Baking your <hi>China,</hi> make use of the Furnace hereafter described in <hi>Chap.</hi> 202. where we discourse of Painting on Glass, putting thereinto your Vessel of Crucible-Earth for Baking the Ware in, and then cover'd over with a vaulted Coverlid, with a hole at top to let out the Flame and Smoak of the <hi>Reverberatory Fire</hi>; for this reason there will be no occasion in this sort of Furnace for any other Open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, because the Baking Vessels with your Ware, are put in a top before the Coverlid is laid on, and so the Fire circulates about it, and it becomes very Red, whereby the <hi>China</hi>-Ware is Baked, as is done in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Pipes.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THE Composition for this must be very fine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the Ware, and not such as is used for ordinary Vessels, we will therefore prescribe the Manner of making it, to prevent the unsuccessful Attempts of such as may be ignorant.</p>
               <p>For this you must take of Shells of every sort which are White and Transparent, grind them well on a Marble, then searce and reduce them to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palpable Powder.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:55296:115"/>To make your Paste of this Powder, first dissolve an Ounce of very white <hi>Gum-Arabick</hi> in a Pail of Water; when 'tis well dissolved and mixt with the Water, dissolve therein about a quarter as much <hi>Quick-lime</hi> as your Powder weighs, then stir and mix it very well, and afterwards put in the Powder and stir all together, and knead it as they do Mortar; of this Stuff form your Vessels according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent sorts you desire, let them half dry, or more, in the Air, before you polish them with your smooth Instrument of Copper, or Iron for that purpose, and so leave 'em until they dry throughly: Being very well smoothed and dried, glaze them over with your White <hi>Enamel,</hi> prepared as we'll direct in the next Chapter, and so set them in the Furnace to Bake and finish, where having kept them a convenient time, let the Fire go out of its self: When the Furnace is cold, take 'em out and paint them and put them in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to Bake a second time, observing what directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons we have already given concerning these Matters, and when the Fire is gone out, and the Furnace cold, you have the Ware in perfection ready to take out for use.</p>
               <p>You may make your <hi>China</hi>-Ware also of pure Earth; let it not be red tho, but White or Gray; you may try the sufficiency of it after 'tis prepared, by Baking some beforehand, and when it comes out of the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace sound and uncracked, 'tis good and fit for your purpose.</p>
               <p>The Preparation consists in drying it well, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing it to a very fine Powder; then put it into fair Water, wherein has been already dissolved a little <hi>Gum-Arabick</hi>; but most of those that make it, employ only Water without <hi>Gum</hi>; after this you may make your Dishes, set 'em to dry, Polish, Dry, Glaze, Bake, Paint, and finish them as before; all which,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:55296:116"/>
those who work at them know better than I can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press it.</p>

               <p>FOR this take of our Milk-white <hi>Enamel Chap.</hi> 149. grind it very fine, as Painters do their Colours; put the Powder afterwards into a Glass-Cucurbit, pouring some <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> thereon; let it digest a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to cleanse off its Impurities, and become fine and transparent; then pour off the <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> washing the Powder in Water over and over again, grind it afterwards with a little Gum-Water on your Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and so glaze the Vessels with it within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, dry them in the Air, and Bake them as before in the Furnace.</p>
               <p>Or you may heat the Vessels to a Redness in the Furnace, and melt the Enamel; when it is in a perfect Fusion, dip the smaller Vessels therein, and pour of it on the larger, for they will take no more on them than will serve them, set them by turns in the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, stopping it very well to avoid the Air: Bake, cool your Furnace, and finish them as before, then take out the Dishes, Paint and Bake them over again, observing all our former Directions.</p>

               <p>THIS is done as the Enamel discoursed of in <hi>Chap.</hi> 192. but much more easily, the Figures being only just dasht over in comparison to them; however you must grind your Colours with Oyl of <hi>Spike</hi> on the Marble, as we have said already, and so paint on the Dishes Story, Landscape, or any other Fancy, but you must never expect to have them thereon so compleat and handsome, as those painted on the enamel'd Plates, because the former are fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht standing, and so enlarge in length or breadth, whereas the other are done on flats, and lying; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Dishes are for the most part round, and not so easily painted; for if they cou'd be as neatly done as the Enamel, they would be excessive dear.</p>

               <p>You must first wet over the Places you would gild with Gum-Water lightly, then apply your Leaves, and so let them dry, this is enough for plain Gilding; but if you would have it carved, or figured, you must make use of a Steel-Graver, and afterwards bath the Gold with Water, wherein <hi>Borax</hi> has been dissolved, powdering it in the mean time with Crystaline Powder, or Milk-white Enamel reduced to a very fine Powder; then set the Dish on a Reverberatory Fire to melt and be polisht; thus you'll have as fine a piece of Ware as can be.</p>

               </head>
               <p>IT is but just we should discharge our Promise of prescribing this Preparation.</p>
               <p>Take a <hi>Paris</hi> Pint of Linseed-Oyl in an Earthen Pot which will hold about two <hi>Paris</hi> Pints, put this on a Fire, and when it begins to boil throw in twice the bigness of a small Egg of <hi>Gum-Arabick</hi> pulveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, stir all well until it be dissolved, then put in an Onion of an ordinary size, and the like weight of Garlick cut small; when the Oyl boils well, and swells up by the force of the good Fire which must be underneath, pour it out into another such Pot, and so in and out of each Pot to the other until all be very well mixed; then put it on the Fire again, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding half an Egg-shell of Powder of <hi>Mastick,</hi> and stir it very well; as soon as it boils again, it will foam and have a great Froth which must be scummed off, and then take it off the Fire and brew the Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients together with the two Pots as before, continue to do thus with it, or stir it on the Fire until it rise no more.</p>
               <p>This done, take a very dry Toast of White Bead to take off the Grease (the Oyl still boiling) and when you put in the Toast, you must at the same time put in some Pin-Dust; stir all well together and let it stand for twenty four Hours afterwards; strain the Oyl through a Linen-cloth, in which is some very fine Sand, the better to filtrate it, and take off the Grease, and so you'll have it pure and clear, which Bottle up for your Use.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:55296:118"/>Or you may (both ways being good enough) first mix with the Oyl two Ounces of Gold <hi>Litharge</hi> pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verized, adding the <hi>Gum-Arabick</hi> as soon as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to boil, and to purifie it let it filter through a Linen-cloth full of Sand, while it's hot, into a Glass-Bottle, wherein is already half an Ounce of fine Camphire Powder, shaking the Bottle very well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Oyl be cold; afterwards lay it in the Sun for fifteen Days, and it will be entirely purged, and the longer 'tis kept will be the better.</p>
               <p>This is all we have to say at present about <hi>China</hi>-Ware, until we have further enlarged our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the Matter, which we have not much stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy'd, because we did not intend to treat of it; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we afterwards thought it incumbent on us so to discourse thereof as an Art dependant on ours; and we hope the Reader will take this in good part, until we may give him something more at large.</p>

               <p>THE Art of Painting has been still so Noble and Excellent, that all those great Persons, who have practised it, were always distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisht among the most eminent of their Age; those celebrated Pieces we have of it in our Days, to the Ornament and Admiration of all <hi>Europe,</hi> has setled so great a Veneration for their Memory, as will eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize it to Posterity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:55296:119"/>The <hi>Dorians, Corinthians, Ionians,</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> were the People that paid the most esteem to this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Art, for which they conceived so great Opinion and Delight, that they lookt upon the famous Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of their Time as Demi-Gods, and ranged them among the first and most Learned Men in the World.</p>
               <p>The Ancients did not only pay a Deference and Honour to the Nobility and Illustrious Birth of Great Men, but to their Worth and Vertue too: Hence the <hi>Athenians</hi> erected a Statue in Memory of <hi>Aesop,</hi> who was but a poor Slave: Would they have done it if this eminently Ingenious Fellow had not possessed so many excellent Parts? No, 'twas not for the sake of his Picture which was too deformed and ugly to please or Charm 'em, but to convince Posterity how the way to Glory is not shut up from the meanest Persons.</p>
               <p>Can there be any thing more taking, or compleat, than the Natural Imitations which issue from Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Has Nature any thing more considerably admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable? Do we not see her display'd in the Pourtraits of those Excellent Masters, who with so much Art and Delicacy have exprest all whatever she has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in this sublunary inferiour Orb, so that 'tis not possible to see them without admiring, or to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire them without Astonishment.</p>
               <p>What wonderful Fancies too have they drawn from the Superiour and Heavenly! They have so lively shewn the Rising and Setting Sun, Night and Day, the Face of Heaven sometimes Calm and Serene, and again darkned with Clouds, the Thunder Showers, Storms and Seas raging, with all their Wrecks, and in the Microcosm, or little World of Man, they have exprest his Joy, Sadness, Smiles, Tears, Pleasure, Dissatisfaction, Life and Death; in short, all the Alterations which Creatures are liable to, whereof the enumeration would be very tedious.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="269" facs="tcp:55296:119"/>This fine Art, as well as that of Glass, does not lessen the quality of its Practitioners, the contrary whereof happens in all other Arts; for Princes, and many of our Monarchs, have granted the Privilege of Nobility to several Masters thereof, to intimate to Posterity the extraordinary Esteem they had for them, upon the Excellency of those Incomparable Pieces which their Pencils had produced.</p>
               <p>Though painting on Glass be very ancient, 'tis yet much more modern than that of Painting on Wood, or Cloath, as being of no longer standing than this Art of Glass-work: The first who painted on Glass, did it only in <hi>Distemper</hi>; that is, in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours mixt with Glue, but this not abiding the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury of Time, they invented the way of doing it with <hi>Fire-Proof</hi> Colours, which are incorporated with the Glass, by Baking and Melting them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and as soon as this Secret was discovered, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Body took delight to practice the Draught of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, and entire Histories thereon for Ornaments, whereof we have still some remaining Pieces on old Church Glass; but those Figures before the Year 1500, had not half the sufficiency of <hi>Base,</hi> or <hi>Relief,</hi> as is required in Painting.</p>
               <p>Those who would fain Work in handsome and lively Colours, made use of Glass-Frit, tinged in the Glass-house, as well for <hi>Carnation</hi> as <hi>Drapery,</hi> whereon they drew the first Lines of the Visage, and other Parts of the Body in Black, and so Shadowed 'em with Strokes and Dashes.</p>
               <p>But Painting having since received an Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>France,</hi> those Works became more perfect, and in so short a time with such advantage of making fair and most exquisite Pieces, as are even at this Day the Admiration of the Learned, of which, all the Honour must be ascribed to the <hi>French,</hi> who were
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:55296:120"/>
the first Discoverers of this great Perfection in the Art.</p>
               <p>We might easily assign several ways of this Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among the Ancients, but since they are out of Practice, and the latter Methods much more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, we shall satisfie our selves in prescribing only such as may suffice, and gratifie the Curiosity of those who love this Art.</p>
               <p>And not only the Method of Painting, but also how to prepare the Colours, to bake and finish 'em in the Furnace; of this we'll give a short Descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the next Chapter; that Secret of ordering the Fire, which is the Life and principal Agent of all the Works, with that of Gilding, Marbling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as will be shewn in the Sequel of this Book.</p>

               <p>This Furnace must be Square, of good Brick, two Foot high, and so much every way, and have three Divisions; the undermost for the Ashes, must be six Inches high, the middle one for the Fire must be six Inches high, and have its Opening five or six Inches broad, and four deep, with a good Iron-Grate,

and three square Bars of Iron across to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Earthen-Stove hereafter described: The uppermost Division must be a Foot high, with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Opening about the middle before of four Inches high, and two wide, to put in and draw out the Ware a Baking, to see if it be well done.</p>
               <p>In this uppermost Division must be put the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Stove of good Fire-proof Crucible Earth, the Bottom an Inch and half thick, and from thence up to the Brim ten Inches full; it must be square as the Furnace, and have two Inches room from on all sides, that the Fire may flame round about it to Bake the Work, and therefore placed exactly in the middle of the Furnace; there must be also in the Fire-part of this Stove, an Opening just against, and of the same Size and Form as that of the Furnace, for the conveniency of putting the Ware in and out.</p>
               <p>Take this Method of distinguishing the Furnace in all its parts, and to lay down a clearer description thereof, observe,</p>
               <p>The Letter A is the Ash-hole for the Ashes that fall from above through the Iron-Grate; and note, That the wider the Opening is, the more violent will the Fire be.</p>

               <p>The Letter E is the Earthen Pan, wherein all the Painted-Ware must be Baked.</p>
               <p>The Letters F are two half Lids of Potters Earth for covering the whole Furnace above: As soon as the Stove is full of Ware, they must be well closed and luted together, to prevent the Air coming in any where but by the four square holes at both ends of the

Lid, and the two Semicircles in the middle, which make a round Hole for a Chimney; when the two half Lids are closed, those five Holes are for letting out the Smoak and Flame of the Furnace.</p>

               <p>The White is compounded of several Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents: The first are small White River Peble-Stones heated red over a Fire, in an Iron-Ladle, and thrown afterwards into an Earthen-Dish full of cold Water to calcine them, and this must be repeated several times, until they be prepared; afterwards being dried, pound them with a Stone, or Glass-Pestle in a Stone-Morter, and so grind them upon a Marble to an impalpable Powder; then mix a fourth part of <hi>Nitre</hi> with it, and calcine them in a Crucible; then pound and grind them again, and calcine them a third time over a smaller Fire than your former, and so take them off for Use.</p>
               <p>This done, when you would Paint with it, add equal parts in weight of <hi>Gip,</hi> a sort of <hi>Talc</hi> found among <hi>Plaster-mold</hi> baked on the Coals to a White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and reducible to Powder, and <hi>Rocaille,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we have already spoken, grind them all three very well together in a hollow Plate of Copper, with <hi>Gum-Arabick</hi> Water; thus have you your White in good condition to Paint withal.</p>

               <p>AS this Colour cannot be omitted in any sort of Painting, so in this; the manner of using it is much the same, and the Preparation easie.

               <p>THIS Colour requires a more costly Preparation than the precedent, because it cannot be well done without a tenth part of prepared Silver, as we shall shew hereafter.</p>
               <p>Take fine Silver in Plates from the Copple, stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie 'em in a Crucible, with Powder of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> or <hi>Nitre,</hi> the first and last Lay being of the Powder, and so calcine them in a Furnace; this done, cast it out, as soon as all the <hi>Sulphur</hi> is consumed, into an Earthen-Bason of Water, and afterwards pound it in your Stone-Mortar until 'tis fit for the Marble, and so grind it with some of its Water wherein it was cooled, for six Hours; then add nine times
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:55296:123"/>
its weight of Red-Oaker, and grind them together for a full Hour, and 'tis done and fit for Painting on Glass.</p>

            <div n="206" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. CCVI. To make a <hi>Blue</hi> for painting Glass.</head>
               <p>THE whole Secret of this Preparation, depends on the calcining the Ingredients, and goodness of the Crucible: Take two Ounces of <hi>Zaffer,</hi> two Ounces of <hi>Minium,</hi> and eight Ounces of very fine White Sand; put all these into a Bell-metal Mortar, and pound them very well, and so into a Crucible covered and luted over a quick Fire for an Hour; then draw off the Crucible, and pound them again as before: This done, add a fourth of its weight in <hi>Salt-peter</hi> powdered, and having mixed all very well together, return them into a Crucible covered and luted, which place again in the Furnace for two Hours at least, continuing such another Fire as the former: The Crucible being off and cool'd a second time, grind the Mass as before, and so put it into a Crucible again, with a sixth part of <hi>Salt-petre,</hi> and let it remain on the Fire for three Hours; then take off the Crucible, and immediately with an Iron-Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tula red hot, take out the Matter lest it should stick, being very clammy and hard to be emptied.</p>
               <p>'Tis convenient to have strong Crucibles for this Calcination, because it remains so considerable a while in the Fire, and they must be luted with an extraordinary lute; you may use that we have given directions for in <hi>Chap.</hi> 109. adding Powder of <hi>Borax,</hi> to the Powder of Glass vitrified, which helps the Fusion of the Glass, which we have omitted there;
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:55296:123"/>
but the greatest stress lies in Baking the Crucible af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in a small Fire, to cement the Pores, and make the Earth compact as Glass, which would be very much furthered, if you threw on it a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble quantity of Salt as it comes out of the Fire, this would glaze it, and capacitate it for retaining the Spirits in the Fire.</p>

               <head>CHAP. CCVII. To make <hi>Red Colour</hi> for Glass Paint.</head>
               <p>THIS requires as much caution as the Blue: You must take Scales of Iron, and Litharge of Silver, of each a Dram, <hi>Feretto</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> half a Dram, <hi>Rocaille</hi> three Drams and half; grind all these for half an Hour on a shallow Copper-Plate, in the mean time pound three Drams of Blood-Stone in an Iron-Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and add it to the rest; then pound a Dram of <hi>Gum-Arabick</hi> in that Mortar to an impalpable Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to take off the remains of your <hi>Blood-stone,</hi> and so add it to the rest, grinding them still continually, lest the Blood-stone be spoiled.</p>
               <p>The best manner of grinding these is to pour Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by little and little on the Ingredients as you grind them, neither wetting them too much, nor too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, but just as much as will keep a good Temper as for Painting: Afterwards put all into a foot Glass, and so drop on it through a small hollow Cane of Wood, or with your Finger, as much Water as will bring it to the consistence of an Eggs-Yolk buttered, or a little more, then cover the Glass to preserve it from Dust, and so let it stand three Days to settle. After this, decant the clearest and purest of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours that rise at top, into another Glass, without
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:55296:124"/>
disturbing the Sediment; and two Days after it has settled anew, pour off again the purest of the Colours as before. This done, set it in the Body of a broken Matrass, or Bolt-head, over a gentle flow Fire, to dry easily, and so keep it for use.</p>
               <p>When you have occasion for it, take a little fair Water in a Glass, and with it moisten as much Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour as you think convenient, that will be excellent for <hi>Carnation</hi>; as for the <hi>Faeces,</hi> which are very thick, dry 'em too, and you may moisten these in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with Water for <hi>Drapery, Timber-colour,</hi> and such other as you think convenient.</p>

               <p>THE Preparation of this Purple-colour, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly like that of the Blue, for this Reason we need not use any tedious Repetitions: You must take an Ounce of <hi>Zaffer,</hi> and an Ounce of very pure and clean <hi>Perigeux,</hi> two Ounces of <hi>Minium,</hi> eight Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of very fine white Sand, pound all these in a Bell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metal Mortar, and reduce it to an impalpable Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; put it afterwards into a good Crucible well covered and luted, in the Furnace; keep a very good Fire to it for an Hour, then draw it out, and as soon as it is cold, pound the Mass over again in the same Mortar; to this add a fourth part of its weight of <hi>Nitre,</hi> mix them together, and put them into the Crucible, and so proceed as directed in <hi>Chap.</hi> 206. until you have a fine Purple-colour.</p>

               <p>The Red in <hi>Chap.</hi> 207, serve for Carnation, but there ought to be one part of <hi>Feretto</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> as in <hi>Chap.</hi> 21. in the Composition, and another of <hi>Rocaille,</hi>

of which we will give the Preparation in the next Chapter; grind these on your Copper Plate, imbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the Powder with Gum'd Water, until it be made fit for use.</p>
               <p>The Red <hi>Faeces</hi> there also mentioned will serve in <hi>Drapery,</hi> and to describe <hi>Timber-work, Trunks of Trees, Hair, Brick,</hi> and such other things; you must take an Ounce of <hi>Feretto</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> in <hi>Chap.</hi> 21. as in the former Composition, an Ounce of Iron-Scales, two Ounces of <hi>Rocaille,</hi> grind them well together up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Copper-Plate, moistening them with Gum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Water, till they be brought to the proper consistence, neither too thick nor too thin, so you'll have a Red inclining to a dark Yellow, very fit for use.</p>
               <p>There be several more made use of in this, as well as in other Painting, but are compounded of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Colours, as we have intimated in our Discourse of Colours for Painting on Enamel, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 186.</p>

               <p>ALL Haberdashers of Small-Ware, sell this <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caille,</hi> which are Green and Yellow Grains, whereof they make Beads, and sell them to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try People; much also of these Trangums are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to the <hi>Indies,</hi> to <hi>Africa,</hi> and the adjacent pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where the Inhabitants wear 'em about their Necks, and on their Scarfs, Bracelets and Wast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belts.</p>
               <p>It is used also in Painting on Enamel and Glass, veryfrequently, though ill qualified and full of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure Lead. We have already taken notice of this before, and tho to avoid this they make choice of the
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:55296:125"/>
most clear and transparent <hi>Rocaille,</hi> and such as is least charged with Colour, yet still 'tis very far from being sufficient; 'tis true, it contains less Lead, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever even that which still remains is likewise impure, and not at all purified.</p>
               <p>We have directed such as work in Enamel, and we cannot avoid it also here to advise you instead of <hi>Rocaille,</hi> to make use of our Crystalline Matter made with <hi>Saturnus Glorificatus, Chap.</hi> 112. or such other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Ingredients, as we have prescribed, which are perfectly cleansed; however to please every Body, we will give a Preparation of this <hi>Rocaille,</hi> and how to compound it, which is very easily done: Thus,</p>
               <p>To make the Yellow Grains, you must take a Pound of fine white Sand, three Pound of <hi>Minium,</hi> mix and pound them together very well in a Mortar, and put the whole into a strong Crucible covered and luted, dry the lute, and put it afterwards into the Glass-house, or Wind-Furnace, where the Fire is violent, to reduce this Matter into Glass, as that of <hi>Saturn,</hi> made in <hi>Chap.</hi> 82. having thus finished the <hi>Rocaille,</hi> make it up into Grains, or any other Shape you please.</p>
               <p>The Way of making the Green, is quite contrary to that of the Yellow: Put three Pound of fine white Sand to every Pound of <hi>Minium,</hi> and it will be very compact. This Stu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <head>CHAP. CCXII. The Way to Paint on Glass.</head>
               <p>THE Painting on Glass is of such fine Effect, as becomes the Admiration of the Learned in all Noble Arts: Nothing can be more wonderful to the Sight; besides, its continuance, and resisting all the Efforts of every Season, and badness of Weather, for several Ages, tho this last Excellency was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the first Practitioners, and reserved for this latter Age, however the Honour is due to them, since they made the first Secrets and Discoveries in this Art, and 'tis much easier to improve, than form a new Invention.</p>
               <p>If Glass were malleable, and discharged of its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Frangibility, nothing could equal the Paint thereon; 'tis not to be tarnished, but always main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains its primitive Beauty and Splendour, without any obstruction to the Transition of Light; and there may as fine Fancy be done on it, as on Limn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there would certainly be nothing on Earth so rich or precious as Glass, whether Painted, or Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, if it had this principal Perfection of Malleabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which many Learned Men have studied for, and daily find; but such is the Corruption of this Sinful Covetous Age, that those Wise Seniors of this Art, do rather chuse to pass for <hi>Ignoramus's,</hi> than run the Risque of Perpetual Confinement, by exposing so fine and delicate a Secret, which would incur the Envy of the Great: and this they take care wisely to avoid.</p>
               <p>We have already taken notice that such as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly Painted on Glass, were both Painters and
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:55296:126"/>
Glass-makers, and that such Gentlemen as were of them, received neither lessening in Birth nor Quality, as in case of other Arts, for this Prejudice is exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the <hi>Art of Glass,</hi> and our Kings have that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem for the Curious therein, that they have grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them such ample Privileges.</p>
               <p>Now to proceed to the Manner of Painting on Glass, which is the Subject of this Chapter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are several Particulars to be considered, which we will endeavour to distinguish as well as possible.</p>
               <p>First choose such Glass as is usually called Glass of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> tho there be such and as good made at <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi>; for this sort of Glass receives the Colours bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than any other, because 'tis best compact and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to resist the Fire; 'tis very easily known; 'tis not altogether White, but of a Whitish Yellow. But to proceed.</p>
               <p>You must have the Original you Paint by, ready drawn and proportioned, on strong Cap-Paper, in all its Colours and Perfection; for your better advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in Pattern, lay it on a Table, and so choose your Pieces of Glass to be Painted, and take care to fit them so to each other, as they may joyn easily after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards without any prejudice to the Draught from displacing them, and so confounding the Figures and Pourtraits, or from the Lead which must joyn them afterwards, by obscuring any parts of the painting; then mark out each piece on the Tablet, by No. 1, 2, 3. for better distinction, and so trace them over with the Black given in <hi>Chap.</hi> 204. with a Pencil, as we shall further shew; do this very exactly, neither too slightly nor too thick, and so let it stand two Days to dry, before you paint it.</p>
               <p>Then having all your Colours in readiness, so as directed in the foregoing Chapters, fill your Pieces off with Colours, for which use the Nib of the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, especially in <hi>Carnation,</hi> where you must be very
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:55296:127"/>
exact; you must also be very Circumspect and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and take a great deal of care not to blot or blur the Tracings, and chose rather to paint on the other side of the Glass.</p>
               <p>All the Colours, except Yellow, may be applied on the same side, and that you must do on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary side, because it is apt to mingle with the other Colours, and if near the Blue, will compose a Green; so that for want of such precaution the whole Work may be spoil'd; if the Yellow transmit it self perfectly through the Quarre, it is as well as if it had been done on the same side; and take notice by the Way, that the other Colours have not so ready a Transition, because they consist of a Grosser Body.</p>
               <p>The Yellow ought to be very equally and justly laid on in a greater or lesser quantity, as you'd have your Shadows; observe this too in the rest, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to lay them on as quick as possible, as we have already said, particularly the Azure, Green, and Purple require the most exactness of any.</p>
               <p>Now to set off and heighten the Lights, in piling a Beard, describing Hair in Drapery, or otherwise, use the Handle, or But-end of the Pencil, a small pointed Stick, or Quill, wherewith take off the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours in those places you would Enlighten, which is easily done.</p>
               <p>Such Works as are done in <hi>Grisaille</hi> you must paint after this manner: Trace your Piece with Black, and let it dry for two Days entirely, do it over very lightly and equally with a Wash so thin laid on, as not to efface the first Lines, and let it dry for two Days; after this run it over again with the same Wash where you find it convenient to give a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Tinge, and let it dry two Days longer: Then to give it the <hi>Lights</hi>; and convenient Heightnings, take the sharp But-end of your Pencil, or pointed
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:55296:127"/>
Stick, or Pen, as before, and take off the Colour of the first Wash, in the most necessary places, and so your Work will be finished.</p>
               <p>To make this Wash is easie: Take a small Pewter Cup, or other Vessel, and put therein a quantity of black colouring, then dissolve <hi>Gum-Arabick</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in its weight of Wine, and throw this on the Black in the Pewter-dish, or Saucer, that it may be very clear, and not easily dry'd, and that you may have your Wash for painting Glass in <hi>Grisaille,</hi> or Gray.</p>

               <head>CHAP. CCXIII. How to order your Glass in the Furnace after Painting, and to manage the Fire.</head>
               <p>AFTER your Glass is fully painted, and the Draughts perfectly finished, the difficulty will be to Bake the pieces, so as to give it a consistency with the Glass, by penetration, which may be thus done. You must work with the Furnace mentioned in <hi>Chap.</hi> 202. and its Stove of good Crucible Earth, to contain all the Work, which must be stratified on this manner.</p>
               <p>Take good Quick-lime well digested, searced, and finely pulverized; and for the better security let it digest thrice in a Potter's Furnace, and so powder and searce it; then make a very even lay thereof, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout half an Inch thick, on the bottom of your Stove, and then a lay of pieces of broken Glass, and afterwards another lay of Powder, and so another of Glass, then another of Powder; the reason of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this Stratification of powder and old Glass, is to prevent any injury from the violence of the Fire,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:55296:128"/>
which will be very smart under the Stove; this done upon the third Bed of powder, lay a lay of painted Glass, and so continue <hi>S.S.S.</hi> each lay of powder and Glass being equally or evenly made, untill all the pieces of paint are put in, or the Stove full, and upon the last lay of Glass lay the uppermost of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der somewhat thicker than the former; then cover the Furnace with its Shrowds of Earth, joyning and luting them well together, all round with the best lute, so that it may admit of no respiration, but through the fire holes, or the Opening of the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, whilst you draw out the proofs or Tryals you make, as we have hinted elsewhere.</p>
               <p>Your Furnace being thus ordered, and the lute dry'd very well, begin to heat it gently with some Charcoal on the outside of the Furnace, at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rance, and so by degrees, and very leisurely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving it, lest the Glass should be broken, or the paint spoil'd; continue thus for two Hours, then thrust the Fire in further, and let it remain there for an Hour, putting it in by little and little under the Stove, where leave it for two Hours longer, then increase the Fire by degrees for two Hours, and so continue to apply Fuel until the Furnace be full of Charcoal, and you perceive the Flame convey its self through every hole of the Cover; keep it thus very violent for three or four hours, shutting the Door of the Furnace; you must be very cautious and circumspect, during the whole Work, from the first two hours that the Fire remains at the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance.</p>
               <p>Observe from time to time to draw forth your Tryals, or pieces of proof in your Stove, to see if the Colours be melted and the Yellow qualified, you may perceive how the Work goes on by the spark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Iron-bars under the Stove.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="285" facs="tcp:55296:128"/>As soon as you find your Colours almost done, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the Fire with some very small Billets of dry Wood, they must be very little for ease in putting them in, and to prevent Smoaking, and to make the Flame environ and reverberate over and round about the Stove, which must be continued until you have finished, this will be in twelve or fourteen hours; then let the Fire go out and the Work cool of its self, and so take it out, and 'twill be finished.</p>

               <head>CHAP. CCXIV. Another Way to Paint on Glass.</head>
               <p>THO the former way be very fine and lasting as can be, yet we will here shew another more easie, and altogether as effectual.</p>
               <p>Take very White Glass, varnish it very thin on one side with a White Varnish, then having before made choice of some fine Impress, or Cut, on Paper, just fit for the piece of Glass you design to paint its Fancy on, dip it in Water, and letting it soak and dry a little, clap the Picture-side thereof to the Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish-side of the Glass, as exactly, plain, and evenly as possible, and so let it dry throughly; afterwards moisten the Paper on the Blank-side, and with a blunt Graver draw off and trace the Lines of the Picture, which will afterward remain perfect and distinctly on the Varnish-side of your Glass Quarre.</p>
               <p>This Draught is for the Model you must paint your Fillings in, and observe that the Tracings and Strokes of the Picture are to serve you in Shadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which cannot be rejected without disadvantage to your piece.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:55296:129"/>The manner of painting on Glass, is quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that of Limning, or Painting on Cloath, or Wood; for in this the paint being but on one side, is plainly visible on the other; here the Settings off are first done, then the compound Colours just run over, and so continuing until perfected; whereas on Linen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Settings-off, or Heightnings, are the last strokes, and their Ground-colour, or first, is that which we end withal, and make our last lay with in all pieces done on Glass.</p>
               <p>We do not shew the Way to make up the Colours, nor how to mix and finish the Artificial ones, for that relates immediately to the <hi>Art of Painting,</hi> of which se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral pieces are extant, and not to this <hi>Art of Glass</hi>; and these noted herein are the same as in the other <hi>Art of Painting on Cloath,</hi> and not very uneasily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.</p>
               <p>You must also paint on Glass, just as in <hi>Miniature,</hi> with Water-Colours, laying your Picture under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath it, as before, and this will shew finer than if done in Oyl; besides, the Colours dry in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Your pieces being thus done in Oyl, or Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour, may receive a very additional and improving Beauty, by over-laying all the Colours, except the <hi>Ground,</hi> with Leaf-Silver, which will appear very glorious and lively on such as are transparent; to wit, Lakes, Verditers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>WE promised to shew this Way of Gilding on Glass after we had done with Painting, and this we will discharge here.</p>
               <p>Take any Glass you please, and moistening it over where you design to gild, with Gum-Water, apply your Leaf-Gold, and so let it dry; cover the Glass over with any piece of hollow Glass, and set it on an Iron-Plate at the Mouth of the Furnace to heat gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly, and when 'tis well heated, move it in further, and in a very little time it will be red hot; then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw it, and let it cool slowly at the Furnace Mouth. Thus if you have laid your Gold well on at first, you'll find it so well communicated to the Glass, that 'tis impossible for any Tryal to endamage the Gilding.</p>
               <p>And after this method you may do with Globes, and give them a wonderful Beauty, which no Dust, nor injury of Time can alter.</p>

               <p>THIS second Way is altogether as fine as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; besides, the Gilding is better coated, and less exposed to Injury.</p>
               <p>Take a Glass and moisten it every where, you design to Gild, with Gum-Water, and lay on
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:55296:130"/>
your Leaf-Gold, letting it dry; this done, run the Gold over with Water wherein <hi>Borax</hi> has been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, and so dust it with impalpable powder of Glass; set it afterwards by degrees into your Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, until it become red hot, and the powder on the Gilding be melted and run; then draw it out leisure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, letting it cool at the Mouth of the Furnace, and you'll have your Glass very finely Gilded, so that nothing in Nature can spoil it, unless it be broken.</p>
               <p>Or you may Gild on Glass with Linseed-Oyl, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as in <hi>Chap.</hi> 198. after the same manner as on <hi>China,</hi> but the Ways we have just now given, are so fine, that we look upon them to be more excellent; such as would make a choice may work by Directions in this present Chapter.</p>

in like manner blow in the Blue-Enamel, Scales of Copper, Orpiment, and Lake, all in fine powder; these Colours will stick in Undulations, because the Glew is moist; you may do thus with any other Colours: This done, take Plaister well pulverized, and put a good quantity thereof into the Vessel, and shake it well all over before (and until) the Glew be quite dry, and it will stick all round, then shake out what remains loose, and you'll have the outside fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly party-colour'd and Marbled, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>When these Colours are well dried, they will stick so to the inside, that they will never come off, but remain always fine; set these Globes on Stands where they may be for Ornament, and the pleasure of those who shall see and consider their Admirable Beauty.</p>

               <p>NOT to omit any thing which at all concerns the <hi>Art of Glass,</hi> we thought convenient in this <hi>Tenth Book,</hi> to give the Publick a Method of Extracting all manner of Essential Tinctures from Herbs, as well as Flowers; a Work not only neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for <hi>Painting,</hi> but <hi>the Art of Glass</hi> too: We shall

also give Directions to make Lake of several Colours, <hi>Vltra-marine</hi> of <hi>Lapis-Lazuli,</hi> with <hi>German</hi>-Blue, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The manner we prescribe for making these Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, does equally qualifie them for tinging Glass, Stones, Enamel, and for Paint on Enamel and Glass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, and all this so prepared, as not to press on the Diversions, or pall the Pleasure of the several Artists, or other curious Persons, who employ them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves that way for Recreation.</p>
               <p>What can be more admirable, than the Products, and Liberality of Nature, in bestowing such excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Enamel on Flowers and Plants, as contribute to furnish Painting with such fine and lively Colours, which the Industry of Mankind can extract, and so well adapt to the Conveniency of Art, as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Effects, finer, and more beautiful than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whatsoever.</p>
               <p>The use of Flowers and Plants, is not wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to this Noble Art, but they are also proper for Dying, and have much more excellent success in <hi>Physick,</hi> where their Vertues are infinite, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No Product in Nature is useless, but the very meanest has its necessary Properties; and those which seem the most abject and venomous, (even the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Poisons) have admirable Effects in Medicines, when duly prepared; and this the Professors of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick are not unacquainted withal, tho' very many pretend to those Studies, whose Endeavours are far short of handing them through the secret Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies thereof.</p>

               </head>
               <p>WE will give several ways of making Lakes of several Colours: The first with a <hi>Lixivium,</hi> or <hi>Lee,</hi> made of <hi>Soda</hi> of the Glass-house, and fresh <hi>Quick-lime,</hi> which must be pretty strong, in which put your Broom-Flowers, over a small Fire, until all the Tincture be drawn from them, the Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers become White, and the Lee receive the Yellow Colour: Then take out the Flowers, and put the <hi>Lixivium</hi> into a glazed Earthen Vessel to boil, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereto as much <hi>Roch-Allom,</hi> as it can well dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve; then take it off, and put it into a large Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, mixing it with fair Water, so the Yellow will separate and descend to the bottom, let it rest there a little, and afterwards decant the Water off gently, and so put in more fresh to it again and again, until the Water has drawn off all the Salt and Allom from the <hi>Lixivium,</hi> and it become clear: Thus the Colour will be very well cleansed of the Salt and Allom, and remain exceeding fine and bright, spread it on pieces of White Linen, and let it dry in the Shade on new-baked Tiles, and you'll have a most admirable Yellow-Lake for Painting.</p>

               <p>TO avoid unnecessary Repetitions, we have thought fit to bring all these under one Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, because the Method for extracting their Colours is the same in one as in t'other, and done with the former <hi>Lixivium</hi> of <hi>Soda</hi> and <hi>Quick-Lime.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You must steep and boil each sort of Flowers, or Herbs by themselves in the <hi>Lixivium,</hi> giving it time to draw off the Colour entirely, which you'll soon perceive when the <hi>Faeces,</hi> or Flowers grow white, and the <hi>Lixivium</hi> deepened with the Tincture; then pour off the <hi>Lixivium</hi> gently into your Earthen gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed Vessels, and set them over a Fire, putting in as soon as they begin to boil as much <hi>Roch-Allom,</hi> as they can well dissolve, and so take them off.</p>
               <p>After this pour all together into a large Earthen Vessel glazed, and pour into it fair Water, to make the Colour precipitate; let it stand and settle, then pour off the Water, and put in fresh; and thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to change the Water until it pour off as clear as you put it in, and taste flat, or insipid, so as you may conclude all the <hi>Soda,</hi> Salt of <hi>Alom,</hi> and <hi>Lime,</hi> are drawn off: Thus you'll have at the bottom, a very fine Tincture to make a pure and delicate Lake withal, of the same Colour as your Flowers, or Herbs that were used; spread it on pieces of Linen, dry them in the Shade on new-baked Tiles as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. After the same manner you may draw any

               <p>You must have the Flowers, or Herbs newly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, fresh enough to stain a Card with their Juice pressed thereon, else they'll not serve your turn; put these into a Glass Cucurbit with a pretty large Mouth; pour in among them good Strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Waters to drown them by four Inches, joyn a Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pient to it, and lute the Joints very well, letting them dry; this done, place the Alembick on a Sand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Furnace, keeping a very gentle.

               <head>CHAP. CCXXIII. To Extract <hi>Scarlet-colour</hi> from <hi>Kerm-Berries,</hi> for making a Fine Lake.</head>
               <p>THE Name of <hi>Kermes</hi> is purely <hi>Arabick,</hi> for in that Country these Berries grow on a small Tree, or Shrub, and from that their Native Soil, were transplanted into <hi>Spain, Portugal, Provence,</hi> and <hi>Languedoc,</hi> where they now are plentiful; several would perswade us, that 'tis a sort of Oak, called in <hi>Latin, Coccigera,</hi> but the Leaves which are prickled like those on <hi>Holly,</hi> only smaller, shews us the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <p>These Grains, or Berries, have several other uses than in Painting, being of excellent Vertue in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick: Of them the Apothecaries make their Syrop called <hi>Alkermes,</hi> and from the remainder of them which is left behind in the Strainer, they draw a substance for the Dyers, which is used in colouring of Stuffs.</p>
               <p>Several ways may be given to extract the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of these Grains for making Lake; we'll on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly insist on two, the first is indifferent long, but very excellent, and produces a Tincture whereby i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The way of making the Lake in <hi>France,</hi> is very modern, and 'tis but of late they have had this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret in <hi>Paris,</hi> which was brought from <hi>Venice</hi>; now since few are familiar with it we are willing to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish this, that many may know how to Wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="297" facs="tcp:55296:134"/>Take four Quarts of clear Water, and four Pound of Wheaten-Bran, two Drams of Oriental <hi>Piraster,</hi> and as much <hi>Foenugrec,</hi> set all in a Kettle over a Fire, till the Water be Milk-warm; keep your Hand in it until you can bear the heat no longer; then take it off, cover it with a Cloath, that the heat may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the longer, let it repose for twenty four Hours, then run off the <hi>Lixivium,</hi> and keep it for the following purpose.</p>
               <p>Get a clean Earthen-Pot, and put therein three Quarts of fair Water to half the <hi>Lixivium</hi>; order a Fire, and let this boil thereon, which when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to do, put in an Ounce of the Grains pounded impalpably in a Brass-Mortar, and searced; then pound a little crude <hi>Tartar,</hi> to take off the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parts of the Grains on the bottom and sides of your Mortar, and so put it in with the Grains; when the Water begins to boil again, take it off in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, and set it to cool.</p>
               <p>This done, and the Water cold, take the Shear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings prepared in the former Chapter, and let them stain therein about half an Hour: Afterwards squeeze it into another Pot by expression; and after you have thus drawn off all the Tincture, put the Shearings into the last Pot, stirring them about very well with a small Stick; that they may stain the sooner, boil all for about half an Hour over a small Fire, else the Tincture will become black, then take the Shearings out, and put them well tinged into a Vessel of cold Water; about half an Hour after pour off the Water gently, and so put fresh on again, then press and spread them to dry in a clean place, where no Dust can come at them.</p>
               <p>This done make the following <hi>Lixivium.</hi> Put on a Hempen-cloath doubled, Vine-stalk-Ashes, or Ashe; of Willow, or some other lighter Wood; pour thereon, by degrees, cold Water, letting it strain
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:55296:135"/>
through into a Vessel set underneath; pour it again on the Ashes, and when it is all run through, set it to settle for twenty four Hours, that the Ashes which it carried off, may fall to the bottom; this done, pour the <hi>Lixivium</hi> by degrees, into another Vessel, rejecting the Sediment, put your Shearings into this, having warmed it: When it begins to be cold, let it boil over a gentle Fire, and it will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come red; take a little of the Shearings, press them well, and if it remains without colour, take off the Kettle immediately, for the <hi>Lixivium</hi> has extracted it entirely, spread a Linen-cloath o'er a Free-stone Bowl, set the Shearings therein, and pour on the <hi>Lixivium</hi> by little and little to strain and yield the Tincture, then squeeze the Cloath and the Shearings therein, to press out all the Colour that remained in them, throw away the Cloath, wash the Shear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings clean and keep them for the like use another time.</p>
               <p>Then put twelve Ounces of <hi>Roch-Allom</hi> well pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, into a Glass Body full of cold Water, letting it dissolve quite; when this is perfectly done, spread a Linen-cloath over two Staves, and set underneath a large Free-stone Vessel, put all the <hi>Allom</hi>-Water into the Bottle of Tincture, and strain it afterwards through this Cloath; the <hi>Lixivium</hi> will go through it clear, and leave the Colour behind, but if it shou'd not be coloured, 'tis only straining it through again, and you'll have done.</p>
               <p>Now to get the Tincture, you must mix all that remains on the Cloath, and gather it together, spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it afterwards over new-made Tiles (which have not yet been allowed time to moisten) on the pieces of Linen, then mold them into Troches to dry sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, without moulding, which wou'd spoil them; therefore you must take great care that the Tiles be not at all moist, and if so, to change them, that it
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:55296:135"/>
may dry the sooner, and thus you'll have a Lake of admirable colour for Painting; you must lessen, or improve the Colour as you find, by a greater or lesser quantity of <hi>Roch-Allom.</hi>

               <p>To make these <hi>Lixiviums,</hi> take ten handfuls of Vine-stalk-Ashes well searced; put this into a large Vessel that will hold thirty Pound of Water, with a Faucet at bottom; press the Ashes very well, and put to them twenty Pound of warm Water; when 'tis sunk to the bottom, open the Faucet, so as it may only drop into an Earthen-Vessel; when 'tis all come out, stop the hole, and strain this <hi>Lixivium</hi> through a Felt Strainer, and so keep it in a Glass, or glazed Pot well covered: This is the strong <hi>Lixivium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, pour in on the same Ashes, the like quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of warm Water, and do as before, so you'll have an indifferent strong <hi>Lixivium,</hi> which keep as the former.</p>
               <p>Do this a third time, and you'll have the mild <hi>Lixivium</hi> mentioned in the preceding Chapter.</p>
               <p>These three are very useful both for moistening, and to draw the Powder of <hi>Lapis-Lazuli</hi> from the Cement; wherewith it must be mixed, as we shall shew in the succeeding Chapters, which Separation being sometimes hard to perform, we are obliged to have recourse to these Varieties of <hi>Lixiviums</hi> stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:55296:139"/>
or weaker, as we find them convenient for the purpose.</p>
               <p>You may yet make another <hi>Lixivium</hi> to take away the greasiness of the Cement, thus: Boil <hi>Calx</hi> of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> as much as you please, in clean Water, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a quarter of an Hour, and keep it for use as the former.

               <p>Put the <hi>Turpentine</hi> into a new glazed Earthen-Pot, very clean, to dissolve over a slow Charcoal-Fire, and continue stirring it with a Wooden-Spatula, throw into this by degrees, the Rosin of the Pine, in small pieces, and stir it still very well; thus put in suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively the Pitch, the <hi>Mastick</hi> in Powder, and last of all the Wax sliced small, stirring all continually about to mix and incorporate: Take great care of your Fire, least the Cement should blaze, or burn, all the Ingredients being hot of themselves, and combustible: Having well incorporated them, pour in the Linseed-Oyl, stirring it as before, and so let it boil gently for a Quarter of an Hour.</p>
               <p>To try whether the Cement be enough, drop some of it off the Spatula into a Vessel of cold Water; if it spread 'tis not enough; but if it do not, 'tis sufficiently boil'd; so take it off.

in hot Water; take care to let it go all through into a Vessel of cold Water; and for the better security, squeeze it along from top to bottom with two flat Sticks, that none may remain in your Bag; afterwards work it well with your Hands, till all the Water be drained from it, and because being hot it may stick to your Fingers, you may anoint them with some of the Linseed-Oyl.</p>

               <p>THE use we have for Linseed-Oyl in our Cement, obliges us to give this Preparation, and way of purifying it, as we promised, whereby 'tis made more fit for our purpose.</p>
               <p>Take good and clear Linseed-Oyl, of the colour of <hi>Saffron,</hi> and put it into a Glass, shaped like an Oxe-horn, with an Hole at bottom to let out the Water, which you must mix with the Oyl, letting them settle until the Oyl rises all up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most; then open the Hole, and let the Water out, and the Oyl remain behind; then shake the Oyl again, with more fresh Water, let it settle, and the Water run out, as before; do thus eight or ten times, till the Water comes out as clear as it went in, and so the Oyl will be pure and fit for your use; keep it well stopt in a Glass-Bottle. If you can't get Linseed-Oyl, you may use Oyl of Bitter-Almonds, without purifying, for it needs none; but take notice, the Linseed-Oyl is best of any, tho cheaper than t'other.</p>

               <head>CHAP. CCXXXIV. How to incorporate the Powder of <hi>Lapis-Lazuli</hi> with the strong, or weaker Cement.</head>
               <p>WE have given in <hi>Chap.</hi> 228. the way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Powder for mixing with the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to extract the Colours; we now come to shew how to mix it with the Cement, in order to extract the <hi>Vltra-marine</hi> from them for Painting.</p>
               <p>Take a Pound of the Powder, and the like quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Cement assigned in <hi>Chap.</hi> 231. observing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to take the first that was workt with the Hands; cut the Cement small, and the pieces being a little wet, put them into a glazed Earthen-Pot, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Fire of red-hot Ashes, to melt, and take care it does not boil; if it should, you must prevent the the damage which it might cause, by putting in some Linseed-Oyl. The Cement being thus melted, anoint all your Spatula over, from the Handle downwards, with the same Oyl, and so put in the Powder by ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little quantities, and taking a great deal of time, that they may the better incorporate; and be sure to stir it all the while very well with the Spatula, so as to make it all alike, until it become like an Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Salve; then off with the Pot, and throw the Stuff boiling hot into an Earthen-Bason of cold Water, and at that very instant take off all that sticks to the sides of the Pot; when 'tis cold enough to be handled, if it appears well coloured, 'tis a sign you have work'd it well: This done, rub your Hand with Linseed-Oyl, and work it as they do a Paste of Bread, or Dough, for one Hour, that it may be
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:55296:141"/>
throughly compact. The longer you work it, the better and easier the colour may be drawn; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards make it up like a Loaf, or Brick, and set it in an Earthen-Dish to dry, pouring thereon some fresh Water; let it steep for fifteen Days, the longer the better for extracting the <hi>Vltra-marine.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>NOW we come to take out the <hi>Vltra-marine,</hi> from its Confinement to make it appear Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant, and in its full Glory.</p>
               <p>Take therefore the Loaf of Cement and Powder, washing it in the same Water extraordinary well with your Hands; weigh it to know the quantity of Oyl it requires, and put it into an Earthen-Bowl, or Dish, very smoothly glazed, rubbing first the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom with your Linseed-Oyl; then pour in Water scarce warmed, until it arise two Inches above the Matter; let it stand in this condition a full quarter of an Hour (or less in the Spring-time;) pour this Water afterwards into the Vessel mentioned <hi>Chap.</hi> 230. adding more warm Water to your Matter, and so 'twill soften: Continue thus whilst there remains any Tincture thereon; by this means all the substance that is good for any thing, will be separated from the Cement, which cannot be done otherwise.</p>
               <p>Whilst it is imbibed in the warm Water, you must move and roul it gently round with two Sticks, or Spatula's of Box, or any other well polished Wood rounded at the ends smooth like a Wallnut; let them be about an Ell long, and an Inch thick. Whenever you perceive the Matter stick to the bottom of your
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:55296:142"/>
Dish, rub your Hands with Linseed-Oyl, and stir it about leisurely so as to colour the Water, which you must put along with the former, in the mean time holding up the Matter with your Staves, lest it should stick to the Vessel.</p>
               <p>Take notice that a little steeping at first will tinge the Water very much, and when the Cement is just yielding its colour, it will discover certain Bluish Streaks on the Water, like the Sun-Rays, and then you must strain this Water out among the other, through a Scarce, that the grosser part of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may remain; afterwards pour in by little and little the fresh warm Water, stirring the Cement easily, that it may not dilate too much, and give its colour all at once. After you have thus stir'd it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout five or six times, close and amass it anew, by which means you'll see how much 'tis diminished, and what quantity of colour it has given.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Lapis</hi> be good and right, you'll find it will the first Steepings yield about four or five Ounces of <hi>Vltra-marine,</hi> which keep apart by its self as the best and finest colour, tho it appear grosser than the others of this sort, by reason of the Gold-coloured Veins, which are peculiarly therein.</p>
               <p>For the second, whereof you'll have three or four Ounces, you must follow the Processes aforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, this indeed will be finer than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but not so good a Colour; keep it also by it self.</p>
               <p>Draw off a third, and this will be still siner than the former, but paler and more bright co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured. You must still pursue the same Directions to extract it, letting your Water be but half luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm, and take care to manage the Cement dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trously with the Spatula's, and so preserve the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour apart.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="313" facs="tcp:55296:142"/>You may extract a fourth Colour after this rate, but the Water must be hotter, and you must press the Cement very well with the Spatula's to squeeze out the Colour, and if meer Water will not do, make use of the mild <hi>Lixivium</hi> of <hi>Chap.</hi> 229. this last Colour will be Grayish, or Ash-colour'd, and of no great value, and therefore not at all to be mixt with any of the rest.</p>
               <p>Observe here that you can't take up less than eight Hours full, to extract the Colours, nor than ten or twelve to allow the Water for setling, and if you perceive the Colour does not come out free e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough with the warm Water, add a third part of our mild <hi>Lixivium,</hi> and if that does not do, use all <hi>Lixivium,</hi> but let it be cold, and when that fails too of effecting it sufficiently, you must make a <hi>Lixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vium</hi> of Vine-stalk Ashes, and this being strained, let it boil for half a quarter of an Hour, until it be sharp enough to bite your Tongue; and then let it settle and grow clear; this is your last shift for extracting your Colour, and with this heated, wash your Cement very well, and set it aside: The whole design of all this trouble, is only to serve for obtaining the greater quantity of <hi>Vltra-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi> and this consists in the goodness of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis Lazuli</hi> and the Cement, which the Circumspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and care taken in all their Preparations must advance.</p>

               <head>CHAP. CCXXXVI. The Method of cleansing the <hi>Ultra-marine</hi> when 'tis se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the Cement.</head>
               <p>AFTER you have extracted all your Colours out of the Cement, and the Water quite setled and separated from them, pour on some of the mild <hi>Lixivium</hi> before prescribed, and so wash them with your Hands (but don't rub it between them) thus you'll take away all the Grease of the Cement; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards wash it three or four times in fair Water, and let the Waters settle well before you put them into their proper Vessels.</p>
               <p>You may else another way purge the <hi>Vltra-marine,</hi> thus. Take the Yolks of Pullets-Eggs, that have been fed only with Corn, and not with Greens, prick these with a Pin, and so moisten the Colours, knead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Mass with your Hands, and washing it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with your mild <hi>Lixivium,</hi> until the <hi>Lixivium</hi> falls off clear again. This done, wash them three or four times over with fair Water, letting the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters settle well before you put them into their Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels.</p>
               <p>This last way of purifying the <hi>Vltra-marine,</hi> is mighty effectual; but here is another help to be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with it, which is a very great Secret, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed thus: After the Colours are quite washed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to former direction, as well as possible, you must cast therein by little and little, a Bull's-Gall, rubbing it by degrees with your Hands; so wash them often in clear Water, and you'll have the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour in full perfection.</p>

               <p>IT is necessary to strain off the <hi>Vltra-marine,</hi> and the rest of the Colours, that if any Grease, or Unctuosity of the Cement remain, it may be taken quite away, for these Colours require a Perfect and Extraordinary Purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>For this Purpose, take a fine Searce, and pour thereon the last Waters, with which you washed the <hi>Vltra-marine,</hi> and so strain them afterwards through another fine Searce, and a third time through Red <hi>Quintain,</hi> or Crape; but you must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve when you strain them, to let them stand till you perceive them limpid and clear, and so soak off the Water dextrously with a Spunge, and be sure not to strain them promiscuously all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>This being done to all the Waters, let your Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours settle in their proper Vessels, and dry in the Shade; when dry, put them into little Leather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Bags; tie these close, rubbing and pressing them with your Hands; this will make them very sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, and when the Bags are opened, they'll shew much fairer than before.</p>

               <p>THIS Method of making <hi>Vltra-marine,</hi> is much more ready than the former; and Experience will shew whether the Colour be a gainer or loser thereby.</p>
               <p>Take a Pound of <hi>Lapis Lazuli,</hi> calcine it in a Crucible, and quench it afterwards in Vinegar, so let it dry, and then reduce it to a very fine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; grind it on a <hi>Porphyry,</hi> with fair Water, and
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:55296:144"/>
so set it in a glazed Earthen Vessel in the Shade, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til it be dry; if you find it coagulated all in a Mass, you must Powder it again.</p>
               <p>This done, make a Cement of three Ounces of <hi>Grecian</hi>-Pitch, four Ounces of Rosin of the <hi>Pine,</hi> three Ounces of <hi>Mastick,</hi> three Ounces of Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kincense, two Ounces of Oyl-Olive; set these over a slow Fire in a small Earthen Pot, into which pour first the Oyl, and when that's hot, put in the Rosin, then the Pitch, then the Incense, and last of all the <hi>Mastick,</hi> stirring them continually with the Wooden Spatula, and let them boil a little.</p>
               <p>Having made the Cement, get another Earthen Vessel, and put thereinto the <hi>Lapis Lazuli,</hi> and pour on it the Cement hot, stirring the whole together with the Spatula very leisurely, until they perfectly incorporate; let this stand a whole Day, and when you would draw off the Colours, pour thereon boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Water, stirring it very smartly.</p>
               <p>When it begins to cool, pour it out, and so put in more hot Water; do thus till the Water begins to draw off the Colour, and so continue until it be quite extracted; you may distinguish the Waters, and so set them apart, and obtain the Variety of Colour, as in the former way.</p>
               <p>If your Colour seems to be clammy, or nasty, you may correct it thus. Add thereto <hi>Tartar</hi> dissolved in Water, as much as will drown it, and let it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose for one Day at least, so wash it in warm Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and you will by that means have it very correct, and well purified.</p>

               </head>
               <p>GRANTING the two former ways to be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, we will however here give a third, which we believe may as well be pleasing to those who are not satisfied with the other; as to such Persons as have a Curiosity for these sorts of Work; and thus we propose to proceed.</p>
               <p>Not to discourse of the Ways to try the goodness of the <hi>Lapis Lazuli,</hi> which we have mentioned suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently already, you must break it into gross pieces, as small as Nuts, then set these in a Crucible into the Furnace, till they redden with heat, and so cast them into cold Water; do thus six or seven times, and so reduce them to impalpable Powder in a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyry-Mortar well covered over, lest the Powder which is very subtile, should disperse away into the Air, and then searce it with a fine Searce also co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
               <p>After this, take of Rosin of <hi>Pines,</hi> ordinary black Pitch, <hi>Mastick,</hi> fresh Wax, and <hi>Turpentine,</hi> of each three Ounces, of Incense, and Linseed-Oyl, each one Ounce, melt all together in an Earthen Vessel, stirring them very well, that they may mix; this Stuff being well incorporated, cast it into Water, and keep it for use.</p>
               <p>To each Pound of <hi>Lapis Lazuli,</hi> add ten Ounces thereof, and set them to dissolve in a Pot over a small Fire, first melting the Cement, and then cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the <hi>Lapis Lazuli</hi> by little and little, observing such an order in this, and continually stirring the Mass with a Stick, that they may mix insensibly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:55296:145"/>
afterwards cast the Mass into an Earthen Vessel of cold Water, and anointing your Hands with Linseed-Oyl, mould it up into a number of Cakes, or Rolls, which leave in cold Water for five Days, shifting the Water every other Day.</p>
               <p>This done, put them into a large and very clean glazed Earthen Vessel, pouring on them some clean hot Water; when that cools, pour in more hot, and do thus till the Pastils soften with the heat of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: This done, put them into hot Water, and let them be until it receive a Bluish colour; strain this Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to reserve the grosser pieces, and so put it into another glazed Earthen Vessel very clean, adding more to the Pastils, which strain through a fine Searce afterwards among the former; continue this until all the Colour be extracted, and no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main behind.</p>
               <p>Your Water must be only warm, otherwise it will occasion a Blackness in the Colour, which is to be taken care of, and imports very much.</p>
               <p>All your coloured Waters being in the Vessel, you may cleanse them of any Unctuosity, by reposing them for twenty four Hours, in which time the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>ALL the Ancients who have treated of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Sorts, and Properties of Precious Stones, have at the same time discoursed of <hi>Pearls,</hi> because they claim a place among the first and best of Jewels, in respect of their Value, as well as their Beauty, and the fixt Quality which they contain, they having been at all times sought

after, for the Ornament and Pleasure of Ladies, as they are at this Day; for these Reasons we thought it convenient to give them a Place among our Works, that (from our Experience) the Curious might be informed how to make such Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ificially as fine and splendid, as those which Nature forms in the Depth of the Ocean.</p>
               <p>We avow that the Production of Pearls, is very different from that of Precious-Stones, because the latter proceeds from the Earth, and the former quite contrary, from the Shell-Creatures which are shrouded in the Bottom of the Sea; these receive their Nourishment from the same Liquld Substance which crntributes to the Growth of the Shells, and this Slimy Substance is resolved from the Watry Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of the Creature, by three several Processes. The first dries it by degrees, the next brings it to an hardness, and last of all, 'tis at certain times em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by the Animal, for the Increase of its Shell, and the place where this is effected in the inmost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veloped recesses thereof. Now the first Principle of these, and all other Precious Stones, descends from Above, to wit, the Universal Seed, which alone can give Birth and Increase to all the Tenants of this vast Universe; and these Precious Stones, as well as the Metals, are nourished in the Womb of the Earth, so the living Creatures bear each other the <hi>Foetus</hi> within its Parent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Oriental Pearls are generated in the Fish, which contains them with the <hi>Mother</hi> as the <hi>Occiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,</hi> or <hi>Western</hi> in our Oysters, but the Beauty of these two, is very different, the Oriental being of a Silver White, and exceeding splendid to the Occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental; the best of these latter seldom arriving to any higher than the Colour of Milk. We will not here take notice of the particular Places of the <hi>East,</hi> where they are found, but only inform you, That
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:55296:148"/>
the best and most beautiful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> come from the <hi>Persian</hi>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Gulf, about the Isle of <hi>Ormus Bassora:</hi> They are found in <hi>Europe,</hi> not only in the Sea, but in Rivers, and Fresh Water; we have them from <hi>Scotland, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesia, Bohemia, Frisia, Lorrain,</hi> &amp;c. in all which Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they are found very fine, only those of <hi>Frisia,</hi> are very small.</p>
               <p>'Tis thought the Fish wherein the Pearl is genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, becoming Sickly and Weak, and not able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spose of the Slimy Moisture for the Growth of its Shell, it remains in the Body thereof, and is dried: Hence the Birth of the Pearl, and so by a continual supply of the like Substance still coating it a-new, it becomes large, just as the Stone in the Bladder of Man, and other Creatures, engenders, and is fed by a Clammy Humour, which cannot be emitted by Urine, but remains behind, and so hardens and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Stone: After the like manner the <hi>Bezoar</hi> Stone is bred in the <hi>Indian</hi> Goats of the Kingdom of <hi>Golcondea,</hi> and in the Galls of Wild-Boars in <hi>India,</hi> and the Hedgehogs of <hi>Malacca</hi>; so several other Stones, to which they give the Name of <hi>Bezoar,</hi> are found in the Galls of Beeves, Deer, Goats, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Animals in <hi>France,</hi> and elsewhere, all which have great Vertues in <hi>Physick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How great and effectual those Pearls are in Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Matters, and what Successes they reach there, is not to our Purpose; we only intend to shew the way of imitating their Beauty by Art so finely, and with such exactness of Lustre, as not to leave it in the power of any to distinguish them easily from the true and Natural ones, they being made of the very fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest sort of Paste that can be, and the same Stuff as the true ones.</p>
               <p>Poverty and Pride are two inseparable Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons among our <hi>French</hi>; such Ladies as make use of pure Pearl, are those that can afford it, and the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:55296:148"/>
Creatures that cannot reach the Price, but would however appear gay, are obliged to have recourse to the Counterfeit, and content themselves with I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation only of Nature: 'Tis some Years since the Use of these latter was introduced in <hi>France,</hi> which now, not only the Puny Ladies, but those of Birth and Quality do wear; this proceeded all from that Fashion which insensibly reached still at the larger Pearls, which these Ladies coveted for Ornament; and because they could not be furnished enough with true, they made use of the Artificial; whence the Common Sort of Persons receiv'd the Advantage to vie with Persons of the First Rank and Quality; which they don't fail to do, without Consideration of either Estate, or Condition, but only to conform with the Mode.</p>
               <p>The Counterfeit Pearls, which are usually made, are just the Colour of the Pastes, and of no Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance but for the present; they are done with a Composition of Brittle Glass and Wax a little melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and for Colouring, they use prepared <hi>Mercury,</hi> Mouth-Glue, or any other Drug, to give them a Brightness, which soon Peels off, and Scales away, especially in the Heat of Summer: The Way which we will give, is not only very good and solid, but exceeding fine, being effected with Seed Pearl; we grant these Pastes to be much dearer than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, but consider their Fineness, and that they'll last for ever; we shall also shew how to make the Counterfeits finer and harder; and we are persuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Preparation of those we shall assign, will appear so easie, and yet produce such fine Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, as shall be very satisfactory.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>G,</hi> is the Chimney, over which you may set se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Iron Plates one above t'other, for drawing the Air.</p>

               <p>If this Furnace be made five or six Inches thick, it will bear all degrees of heat, and serve very conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently for Private Persons, by making it of a suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble largeness instead of the Glass-house Furnace: When you make your Fire of Wood, there will be no occasion for the Hovel of the Ash-hole. But to go on with our Pearl.</p>
               <p>You must take two Pound of thrice distilled Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, one Pound of <hi>Venice Turpentine,</hi> mix them together, and so put the Mass into a Glass Cucurbit; fit to it the Head and Receiver, luting the Joynts; let them dry, and so set it on a Sand-Furnace to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stil the Vinegar; keep a gentle heat, lest the Stuff swell up.</p>
               <p>Afterwards put the Vinegar into another Glass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Cucurbit, wherein you must hang a quantity at dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, of Seed Pearl, strung on a Thread of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver or Gold, done about with a piece of very thin Silk; these must hang in the middle of the Body, so as not to touch the Vinegar: This done, head
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:55296:151"/>
your Cucurbit with a Blind Head, and lute it very well; set it in a moderate B. <hi>Mariae</hi> well closed, there to remain for a Fortnight; the heat of the B. will elevate the Fumes of your Vinegar, and they'll continually circulate about the Pearl, and so soften and bring them to the Consistence of a Paste, which being once performed, take 'em off and mould them up in what Form you please, round, long, or Peaalike, and as big as you think fit; do this with Moulds of fine Plate gilded within; you must not touch the Paste at all with your Hands, but altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Work it with a Plate Spatula, which will fill the Moulds, then bore them through with a Porkers Bristle, or Gold-Wire, and so let them dry a little; then Thread them again with Gold-Wire, and set them in a closed Glass, which lay in the Sun, to dry them to a hardness; set them afterwards in a Glass Matrass, in a Stream of Running Water, leaving it there for twenty Days; and about that time they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume their first solidity and hardness.</p>
               <p>To give them Transparency and Splendour, you must prepare some <hi>Mercury</hi>-Water, after the Rate we shall prescribe in the next Chapter. When you have taken them out of the last Matrass, wherein they were for twenty Days, as the Running Water<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hang them in a Vessel of Glass where the <hi>Mercury</hi>-Water is, and so they'll moisten, swell, and assume their Oriental Beauty: This done, shift them out of this Water into a Matrass closed Hermetically, for fear that any Water should be admitted into it, and so down with it into a Well, leaving it there for eight whole Days; then draw it up, open the Matrass<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and you'll have them as fine and good as any Orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Pearls whatsoever.</p>
               <p>This Method is a little long, but withal 'tis effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual and sure; however 'tis not thus the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,

               <p>You must take Plate Tin of <hi>Cornwall</hi> calcined, let the <hi>Calx</hi> be very fine and pure, amalgamate one Ounce thereof, with two Ounces of prepared <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> well purified; wash the <hi>Amalgama</hi> with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, until the Water remains clear and insipid; then drying the <hi>Amalgama</hi> throughly, put it into a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trass

over a Furnace, keeping such a degree of heat as is required for Sublimation; when the Matter is well Sublimated, take off the Matrass and let it cool, and so take out the Sublimate; to which add one Ounce of <hi>Venice</hi> Sublimate and grind them well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether on a Marble, so put them into another Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trass, close it very well, and set it topsy-turvy in a Pail of Water, and the whole Mass will resolve its self in a little time, all into <hi>Mercury</hi>-Water: This done, filter it into a Glass Receiver, and set it on a gentle Ash-Fire to coagulate, and it will be brought to a Crystalline Mass; take it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>THIS is an easier way than the former, for by Baking them, (as we shall shew) you very much shorten the time which the Preparation would else take up; however you must not expect them so De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate and Natural as the first, the Cause whereof is easie enough conceived; for these Pearl having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged themselves in the Water, as we already no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, 'tis reasonable to believe the hardning them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in the Cold, will be of a much more Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Effect, than if done with heat.</p>
               <p>Take very fair Oriental Seed Pearl for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and reduce it to impalpable Powder on a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:55296:152"/>
to dissolve afterwards in <hi>Mercury</hi>-Water, or clarified Juice of Lemons; if this be not effected quick enough, set it in a Cucurbit over warm Ashes, and be very careful to take the Cream (which in a little time will appear at top) immediately off, so withdraw the Dissolution from the Fire, and let it settle a little; this done, pour it gently into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Glass Body, and keep it a-part, you'll have the Pearl in a Paste at the bottom, with which fill your gilded Plate Moulds, made to what bigness, or form you think fit, pressing the Paste with the Silver Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tula, and so shut them up four and twenty Hours; after you must take and bore them through with a Porker's Bristle, close up the Moulds, and leave them in the Oven in a Paste of Barly Dough, which being half Baked draw out and open, taking away all the Pearl, and steep them in the Dissolution just before directed to be kept a-part, putting them in and out several times; so close them in their Moulds and Bake them again with the like Paste as before, only let this last be almost burnt up before you draw it out; thus you'll have the Pearl well baked and hardned.</p>
               <p>This done, draw it out, open all the Moulds, take away the Pearls and string them on one or more Gold or Silver Threads; steep them in <hi>Mercury</hi>-Water, given in the former Chapter, for about a Fortnight; after this dry them by the Sun in a well closed Glass Body, so you'll have very fine and splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Pearl.</p>

               <p>You must, as in the former, take very fair Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ental Seed Pearl ground to an impalpable Powder<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and dissolve it in Allom-Water, then rack off that Water, and wash the Paste of Pearl which remains at bottom, first with some distilled Waters, then i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

them first, and then cool them in this Dissolution; thus do for about six times at least, heating and cooling them at this rate therein.</p>
               <p>If your Pearl should happen to fail of coming to a sufficient hardness, you may correct and make them exceeding hard by Baking them a second time after this manner.</p>
               <p>Take two Ounces of <hi>Calamy,</hi> or <hi>Lapis Calamina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> in impalpable Powder; add to this two Ounces of Oyl of Vitriol, and two Ounces of the Water of White Eggs; put all these into a Retort, lute thereto a Receiver, and let them distil, you'll have from them a very fair Water, with which, and some very fine Barly-Meal, make a Paste, Coffin your Pearls in this, and Bake them in an Oven as before, they'll thus become exceeding hard, and recover their Natural Transparency.</p>
               <p>There are many other Ways very good to make Pearl with Oyls, which add to the Growth and Largeness of the Seed Pearl, as much as you will have them, but all these Preparations being very te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, and our Book large enough already, we are of Opinion, 'tis best to let them alone for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; besides, we have said enough to hand the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Readers to those Secrets discoursed off, and taught them herein, reserving the more enlarged and fuller Instructions for the first Edition we make hereof in two Volumes.</p>

               <p>THE Beauty of Pearl consists entirely in the Brightness of their White Colour, such as are Spotted, or of a dark Yellow, being the least estimable; you may however restore these last to a true Luster and Whiteness, by letting them soak and cleanse first in Bran-Water, then in Milk-warm Water, and last of all steep them twenty four Hours in the <hi>Mercury</hi>-Water assigned <hi>Chap.</hi> 244. This done, string and hang them in a well closed Glass Body, to dry in the Sun, as before.</p>
               <p>The Bran-Water is made by boiling two good Handfuls of Wheaten-Bran in a Quart of Water, until the Water has drawn all the Strength thereof to it; and thus you are to use it afterwards for cleansing the Pearl; you must string and lay them all together in a glazed Earthen Pan, and pour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one third of this Water, when they have soaked, until the Water be tolerably cooled, that you may endure the heat, rub them with your Hands gently to cleanse them the better; continue so until the water be cold, throw out this cold water, and pour on another third part of the Bran-water still boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and so use it as the former, throwing it away when cold, and then pouring on the remainder of the water, proceeding still after the former man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; after this, just heat some fair water, and pour it on them, to refresh and take away the Remains of the Bran; shift this water, pouring on more fresh warm water; do thus thrice without handling them, then lay them on a Sheet of very clean white Paper,

               <p>VVhite Coral has also the same Effect as the Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baster, using it after the like manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tartar</hi> calcined white, and divested of all its moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, as we have shewn elsewhere, is very good for the same use.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clary,</hi> or Old Salt dissolved, filter'd, coagulated, well dried and ground, is as effectual as any of the former things, for cleansing and blanching of Pearl, by rubbing them therewith a considerable time; you may afterwards lay them up in some <hi>Millet</hi> ground large, and it will contribute to them a Natural Brightness.</p>

               <p>THIS Receipt for making Counterfeit Pearl has a much more fine and solid effect than any now a-days in use.</p>
               <p>Take Chalk well purified, and separated from its grossness and Sand, make Paste thereof, and so mould it up like Pearl in a Mould for that purpose; pierce these through with a Bristle, and let them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards dry before the Sun, or for more dispatch in an Oven, till they receive a just hardness; then string them on a very fine Thread of Silver, colour them over lightly with <hi>Bole-Armoniack,</hi> diluted in water of VVhites of Eggs, then drench them with a Pencil and Fair water, and so apply Leaf-Silver all over, and let them dry; this done, burnish them with a VVolf's Tooth, till they shine very finely.</p>
               <p>To give them the true Colour of Pearl, make a Glue of Parchment, or rather Vellom Shavings; thus Wash the Shavings in warm Water very well, and boil them after in a new Pot to a thickness, and strain this Glew.</p>
               <p>When you use this Glue, you must warm it on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THIS is the Twelfth and last Book of our <hi>Art of Glass,</hi> which should have indeed succeeded the First; but we waited some Memoirs on the Subject, nor we have not yet found them; this made us put it off, and place it here: Besides, there is such a Coherency of Matters, in the Order of the Second Book, as we could not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly dispose of any other way, without breaking

their due Course, and the Affinity and Connection they have with each other, which the Reader may easily perceive; but what matter is it where we place this, so that it may be found among our Works; and we deliver nothing therein, but what we have been familiar withal.</p>
               <p>That of Looking-glasses is undoubtedly the finest and more admirable part of Glass-Work; 'tis the most perfect Master-piece of all the Art. We pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume the Order we have given in placing it here, will be approved of, since 'tis the Subject of the last Book, and the <hi>Twelfth,</hi> which is a perfect Number, and comprehends all other in Sacred Philosophy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Twelve,</hi> the Number of Grace and Perfection, has been highly esteemed at all times for those Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Properties ascribed to it; 'tis very much ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated in Holy Writ, and the Divine <hi>Plato</hi> has u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it with the same Deference in his Works, if the Account which those, who were intimate with this Famous Number <hi>Twelve,</hi> have left of it, were not Foreign to our Design, we could give the Curious such extraordinary Relations, as would create a Mighty Respect in them for the same.</p>
               <p>We already noted in the First Chapter, that 'tis about Two Hundred Years since the Invention of Looking-glasses, and also how they were found out: Before these the Ladies made use of Steel, or Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or well polished Marble Mirrours, these have been in use for many Ages: We can by the help of History, look back on them as far as the Time of <hi>Ozias</hi> King of <hi>Iuda,</hi> which was about the Fourth or Fifth <hi>Olympiad</hi>; and as many Years before the Building of <hi>Rome</hi>; Seven Hundred and sixty four Years after this, our <hi>Christian Aera</hi> commenced. Now tho' the <hi>Tyrians</hi> were very conversant in Glass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, yet they had not the Knowledge of making Looking-glass.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="340" facs="tcp:55296:157"/>Among all the Excellencies of the Art, none comes near this, nothing can be finer, or admit of greater Admiration, than to see that all the Actions of the Beholder, are so justly and lively represented in these Glasses, that he has an opportunity of disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering what is to be valued on him, and correcting what's amiss; these Truths are too apparent for any to disprove; for the Experience of them are at this Day to be made as easily by the Meanest as the Greatest Persons.</p>
               <p>We shall discourse but very briefly of the Metal for making these Glasses; for 'tis the same Crystal we have prescribed throughout the First Book, but we will enlarge on this Matter a little, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of making the Mirrours of Metal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereof we'll shew how to compound the Stuff, and the way of working them.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The second Privilege for the <hi>Manufacture Royal of Large Glass,</hi> was granted <hi>Decemb.</hi> 14.1688. to <hi>Abraham T' Hevart,</hi> for Thirty Years, with the saving Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of Nobility as the former: These having set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at St. <hi>Gobin,</hi> near <hi>La Fere,</hi> did by Letters Patent of <hi>February</hi> 1693. obtain Exemption from the <hi>Tailles,</hi> (or Subsidy on the Third Estate, which is a constant Tax) and other Impositions, as well for themselves, as their Deputies and Servants.</p>
               <p>And to avoid all Contest, these two Manufactures were united by Order of the Council of State, <hi>April</hi> 19. 1695. and Confirmed <hi>May</hi> 1. following, under the Name of <hi>Francis Plaistrier.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for making these Glasses, the same Crystal assigned throughout <hi>Book</hi> 1. is sufficient; the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is only instead of Working it as you do there, to cast it flat and not blow, as in <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. to which we refer the Reader.</p>
               <p>The Manner of Casting the Metal, did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence with the Invention of Looking-glass; for the Workmen at first, used to take a piece of Metal ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry large, clipt and done on the Marble into Quarries as big as they'd have them; these they set after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards on a Pallet of Iron in the Furnace, till they were in a Fusion, and so spread and united; hence they took and put them into another little Furnace for that purpose, <hi>S. S. S.</hi> with fine searced Ashes to Bake; this done, they raised the Fire by degrees, and so let it go out again, and drew off the Glasses, working them after our manner in the next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="342" facs="tcp:55296:158"/>Thus too they wrought their little Round Glasses, or Mirrours, first shaping them out of a long piece of Metal, by Circumvolution, and afterwards clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping them as the former, so finished them in the Furnaces, and made them fit for Polishing.</p>
               <p>Since that time having attempted to make them very large, they fell upon the Way of Casting the Glass like other Metal on Sand Beds, such as the Founders use; and to perform it the better, they have a Roller of Metal to run over the Surface of the Glass Metal for enlarging the Plate, and to smooth and compact it withal.</p>
               <p>For such as would make them very large indeed, as are wrought at <hi>Muran</hi> near <hi>Venice,</hi> and in our Royal Manufacturers, they had a much better, and easier Method than doing them on Sand, <hi>viz.</hi> in large Tables of well polished Copper, whereon they cast the Metal, but these not having strength enough to abide the Heat, we have since made use of Iron, which will sufficiently perform the Effect.</p>
               <p>These Tables whereon the Glasses are at first sight Cast to their proper Largeness, must have their bottom sunk as low as you intend the Thickness of your Glass-Plate, and have a Conveniency to push it out, as soon as ever 'tis prepared thereon.</p>
               <p>Some make use of Marble ones with Covers, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver which they have a Plate, or Runner of Metal, to slide and press it on the Glass Metal, that the Glass Plate may be the more compact and even.</p>
               <p>Thus are large Glasses made, which are no less surprizing than pretty, and 'tis a very considerable Improvement they are brought to at this Day, of making them so extraordinary large for Mirrours: One would admire to what Perfection the Wit of Man may arrive at, and is capable of bearing from the advantage of Serious Application and Study in profound Matters.</p>

               <p>AFTER you have it from the Furnace, you must lay it on Sand, in a convenient place to strengthen, else it will break in Working it; then grind it on very fine Sand and Water.</p>
               <p>This time 'tis that the Workmen give it the first Fashioning; then they do it over again with Powder of <hi>Emery</hi> instead of the Sand, and so give <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <head>CHAP. CCLIV. How to make Spherical Concaves, and Convex Glasses, commonly called Burning Mirrours.</head>
               <p>BEFORE we discourse of the Metal Mirrours, we will shew how to do such of Glass: The Use of these Glasses is to unite the Sun-Beams, and so kindle a Flambeau, Wood, or any other Combusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Matter. By them Metals also may be dissolved in a little time as easily as in a Crucible on a Furnace, or at a Forge.</p>
               <p>The Whole Mystery of making them, is to have the Moulds of a Round Shape, otherwise they have but a very weak Effect on the Sun Beams; the Moulds must be so exactly made, as neither side shall differ from the other.</p>
               <p>To make the Concave Glass, you must have the Mould Convex, and the Convexity thereof must be made by a Sphere, according as you have it greater or less; and 'tis from this Sphere the Convexity of the Mirrour must be taken: As for instance, Take a Sphere of what bigness you please, divide it equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and also one of the Hemispheres in three equal parts, by Planes parallel to the great Circle, the Convex, Segment shall then be the sixth part of the whole Sphere, and the Measure of your Mirrour: To do this you may have recourse to the Works of <hi>Archimedes, Iohn Baptista Porta, Kircher,</hi> and many other Authors.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="346" facs="tcp:55296:160"/>If you would make the Mirrour a Convex Glass, you must have the Moulds Concave, and these you may do two ways, thus: Take the two Concave Sides of the Mould, and closing them together equally, as the Founders do their Frames, pour in through the Mouth of the Mould your Crystal Metal, letting it fill the Mould, and afterwards cool. Another way is, to take two Concave Mirrours, and joyning their Faces, solder them well all about, only leaving a small Orifice, through which you may fill it with some <hi>Aqua Vitae,</hi> and so stop the Hole, and frame them with Wood, or Metal: This sort of Mirrour, has a more ready Influence on the Sun Beams then any other; we'll say something of the Effect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of when we come to speak of the Metal Mirrours, but upon the whole Matter you must have these Glasses all very well polished.</p>
               <p>These Burning Glasses may be made Parabolick, or Spheroidal, and such have still a better Effect than the Spherick: You must proceed in Mould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them as with the former; you must observe a just proportion in doing them; for when they are too much raised, they are hindered by their Deepness from having a good Effect; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this depends the Whole Nicity of the Art.</p>

               <p>The Metal of these Mirrours is called <hi>Steel,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is of a very hard and bright Composure and Temper, and the harder the Metal, the better the Mirrour, and the easier to polish; the Whiteness of it is very convenient for giving the Quality of Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and not only for that, but several other Uses; if it be too Red, or Black, it alters the true Distance and Colour of its opposite Objects; you must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make them of this following Composition.</p>
               <p>Take three Pounds of Copper, one Pound of fine Tin, half an Ounce of White <hi>Arsenick,</hi> an Ounce of <hi>Tartar</hi>: First, melt the Copper, then put the Tin in immerged in the Copper, else it will fume away in the Melting, and leave the Copper behind; these two being well melted together, cast in the <hi>Arsenick,</hi> and <hi>Tartar:</hi> After this let all melt for two or three Hours, and so Mould it.</p>
               <p>Some Persons dose with the former weight of Copper and Tin, half a Pound of White <hi>Arsenick</hi>; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="348" facs="tcp:55296:161"/>
of <hi>Antimony.</hi> Here is another way to compound this Stuff of the following Ingredients; and after that another Composition much more excellent than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Take a Pound of well refined Copper, melt it, then add three Pounds of fine Tin; as soon as these are well melted, add six Ounces of Red <hi>Tartar</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cined, one Ounce of <hi>Salt-petre,</hi> two Drams of <hi>Allom,</hi> and two Ounces of <hi>Arsenick,</hi> let these melt for three or four Hours, that the Salts may evaporate, and the Stuff will be fit for moulding; this Stuff is more solid and hard than the former, and much better to make the flat Mirrours for Looking. You shall be shewn how to polish them in the next Chapter.</p>
               <p>We having promised to assign a much more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Stuff for Concaves than the former ones, will give it here; because of the hardness and compactness thereof, it is more capable of polishing, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently much better than the rest.</p>
               <p>Take Plates of Copper one Pound, mince 'em that they may be put into a Crucible, imbibing them with Oyl of <hi>Tartar</hi>; then powder a quarter of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> a just degree, and the Oyl begins to evaporate; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> this time the Oyl will prepare the Copper for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the <hi>Arsenick,</hi> which must enter the Copper as easily as Oyl does Leather; set it again on fresh Sand, and increase the heat of the Furnace, giving i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the same degree as before, until the Oyl evaporate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and boyl up; then take off the Crucible, let it cool and break it, you'll find your Copper of several Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:55296:161"/>
and would be much better, if instead of <hi>Arse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick,</hi> you made use of <hi>Orpiment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take of this Copper one part, of Latten two parts, melt the Latten on a smart Fire, and so put in the Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; when they are well melted, cast the Metal Drop by Drop into a glazed Earthen Vessel full of Water, over which lay a Bush, or Broom for the Stuff to go through; thus you'll have a Metal not to be touched with a File, nor Brittle, as good as any Steel for all uses whatsoever.</p>
               <p>Take of this hard Metal three parts, and best Tin of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> which has no Lead in't, one part; melt the Metal before you put in the Tin; after these are well incorporated, you may fill your Moulds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the best of all our Compositions for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of all sorts of these Metal Mirrours; 'tis white, hard, not Brittle, and very easily polished exceeding fine.</p>

               <p>WHATSOEVER Exactness you use in Mould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these, they do never receive their true Shape and Perfection, until they are Polished and Burnished; in doing which, least you should spoil, or endamage them, you must Work away the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side at the Wheel, with the Sand-stone, which the Pewterers and Brasiers make use of, and then apply the Handle, and Polish them sufficiently by rubbing with Water.</p>
               <p>This done, take it off this Wheel, and put it on the Second, where rub it with <hi>Emery</hi> prepared, that
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:55296:162"/>
it may be finely polished, so as the Scars may be scarce perceptible. Do this in an Oblique Line.</p>
               <p>Then take it off this, and set it on such another; rub it with Blood-stone prepared, and afterwards use <hi>Calx</hi> of Tin, working it for a long time, until it have its due Burnish and Perfection, still doing it in the same Obliquity.</p>
               <p>You must keep these Mirrours from the Moistness of the Air, and Steams; or if they should happen to be endamaged by any such, you may restore them by rubbing on them a piece of Deer, or Goats Skin, humouring the Oblique Line; you must not use any Woollen, or Linen Stuff, for they spoil these Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.</p>
               <p>These Mirrours may be also polished with Lead Artificially melted, with Emery and Water, for the First Process; and very fine Emery and Lead for the Second; and in the Last, with Blood-stone and Tin Dross; these make a finer Burnish than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; for the Mirrour is highly polished by the Tin-Dross.</p>
               <p>This is all we resolve to give account of on these sort of Mirrours, for attracting and uniting the Sun Beams. There are many other, as Cylinders, Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramids, whereof we forbear to discourse, since the Authors which have writ of them, have done it with much more sufficiency than we pretend to.</p>
               <p>They ascribe the first Invention of Burning Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours to <hi>Prometheus,</hi> when he stole the Fire from Heaven to carry to the Earth. <hi>Archimedes</hi> made ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry happy use of them in defence of his Country, when he burnt the Fleet of <hi>Marcellus</hi> before <hi>Syracuse,</hi> by placing his Burning Glass on the highest Turret in the City, whence proceeded such a mighty Confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration, as destroy'd that vast Flota in spight of <hi>Neptune</hi> and the Waters. <hi>Proclus</hi> too, a Brave and Famous Mathematician, burnt the Fleet of <hi>Vitelian,</hi>
                  <pb n="351" facs="tcp:55296:162"/>
that came to Besiege <hi>Constantinople</hi>; which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by this Industry.</p>
               <p>Many other Fine and Admirable Relations might be given of the Effects of these Mirrours, but they are too tedious: We shall therefore here put an end to this Chapter, and consequently the whole Book, desiring the Reader to receive all in good part, and excuse the lesser Faults of Impression and Phrase, since we can assure him the Doses are justly prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and the Preparations exact which we have as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed.</p>

            <head>AN APPENDIX Shewing how to Make GLASS-EYES Very Natural.</head>
            <p>THIS Secret is fine, and never was made publick before: The Eyes may be done so curiously, that the Nicest Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can scarce discover them to be Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial.</p>
            <p>You must have a lighted Lamp, and a long hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low piece of Crystal, as thick as the middle of a Pipes Shank; the Bore must be pretty wide, and the Pipe about four Inches in length; let the Mouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end be like that of a Trumpet, and the other wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened and turned outwards like the Breech; this may be done by heating one end in the Flame of your Lamp, and whilst it is hot, turn it so with a pair of Nippers.</p>
            <p>Hold this Pipe in your left hand (having before put a little Cotten into it, about an Inch or less from the Mouth, to hinder your Breath from being too
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:55296:164"/>
violently blown on the Work;) let it be between your two Fore-fingers and Thumb (as you'd make a Pen;) heat the Wide end in the Flame red hot, and so wind long Thread White Enamel about the grossness of a Bugle; your Threads must be red hot too, and solid, then they'll easily joyn the Crystal Pipe; make by this Serpentine Winding a Convex of such Diameter, as when blown out will answer that of the Eye you would imitate.</p>
            <p>This done, keep the Work in the Flame till red hot, and so blow it out into an Orbicular Form, of a just largeness; then heating a-new the top, pinch with your Nippers a small Hole, and so turn it with the end of them round, of the bigness your Eye must be within the White, in this Hole wind pure Thread-Crystal as small as fine Packthread, till you fill it up, taking away the Superfluity (if any) with your Nippers; heat it in the Flame, blowing gently often; by this the Crystal will work Convexly, to give you the full shape of your Eye.</p>
            <p>Upon this Crystal (heating it again) you must wind Crystal Thread small almost as Horse-hair, and coloured as the Eye you'd imitate; cover it once o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and as soon as the Center fills, cut off the Thread with your Nippers, that no Surplus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main: You must hold it often in the Flame, still gently blowing to keep it in a true order.</p>
            <p>Afterwards with a piece of Black Enamel, about the thickness of a Duck-Quill, lay on the Black of the Eye; be very careful not to give any of these Threads or pieces of Enamel, too great a heat, nor apply too much of this Black, for it will spread; therefore you must proportion your Heats and Quantities very exactly, still continuing the Work in the Flame, and gently blowing as often as you'd restore it to its Shape: After this, cover the Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalline part of the Eye with some Crystal of a solid

piece, about the thickness of a Goose-Quill, and so heating and blowing as before, bring it to its due Form. Then hold the Side thereof in the Flame, and with a Thread of White Enamel, not quite so hot, you may as it were cut out the Shape of your Eye, as you'd have it, Oblique, or otherwise; then border it with the said Thread, holding the Edges in the Flame, to become smooth and even.</p>
            <p>Now if you find too much Enamel in any part of the Border, you may take it off with another Thread of the same Enamel, not altogether heated so much as that you'd diminish, which must be held in the Flame accordingly: Then proceed to Cutting or Filing; and last of all, Anneal it in a small Pan of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
