            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WE could very willingly appeal to our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
themselves, were they uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
whether a plainer Proof can be
given of a Baffled Cause in a Controversy
relating to any Point of revealed Religion, than for the
Assertors of it to decline maintaining it by those Books,
which alone can acquaint us with Divine Revelations.
But 'tis Notorious that the <hi>Romanists</hi> are highly charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
upon this Account, in their Endeavours to persuade
the World, that <hi>theirs</hi> is the only true Church. They
need not be told, that we are beholden to the <hi>Holy
Scriptures</hi> for our having any Notion of such a thing as
a <hi>Church,</hi> and they and we are agreed that <hi>that</hi> only is the
true <hi>Christian Church,</hi> which professeth the true <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:95581:3"/>
Faith:</hi> and therefore how is it possible they should
not be aware, that the best way to be satisfied whether
those, who challenge to themselves the Title of the <hi>True
and Catholick Church,</hi> have it really belonging to them,
is, to examine their Faith by the Holy Scriptures?
Which 'tis hard to imagine they can think to be <hi>so imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
a Rule</hi> of Faith, as to believe it a justifiable thing to
be so averse to this Method, as we have ever found they
are. This we of the <hi>Reformation</hi> have always stuck to,
and we are desirous of nothing more, than that it may
be tryed by the Faith we profess, whether we are sound
Members of the Catholick Church, and the soundness
of our Faith may be tryed by the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>But instead of taking this Course, those of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Communion have invented and do insist on a Company
of Notes and Characters of the Church, which are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
not to be met with, or are far from being plainly
delivered, in Scripture. Had this been <hi>our</hi> practice, I
appeal to their own Consciences, whether they could
have imputed it to a better Cause, than our being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious
to our selves of the disagreeableness of our Faith
with the Doctrine of Scripture, and our not daring to
have it brought to this Touch-stone.</p>
            <p>Of this sort of Notes Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath given
us no fewer than <hi>Fifteen,</hi> among which he could afford
no Place to this Note of ours; though 'tis as evident as
the Light, that this one alone would have signified
much more to his Purpose, than all <hi>that</hi> long Bead-roul
put together.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Design of this Discourse is to examine his</hi> Fourth
<hi>Note, viz.</hi> Amplitudo, sive Multitudo &amp; Varietas Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentium.
Amplitude, or Multitude and Variety of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.
<hi>And how far he makes it to extend, his next
Words inform us, viz.</hi> Ecclesia enim verè Catholica, non
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:95581:3"/>
solum debet amplecti omnia Tempora, sed etiam omnia Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,
omnes Nationes, omnia Hominum Genera. The truly
Catholick Church ought not only to comprehend all Ages, but
also all Places, all Nations, and all Sorts of Men. <hi>And,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> He endeavours to prove <hi>this</hi> to be a true Note.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To make it to belong to the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and to her alone.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To perswade us that those particularly who
call themselves the <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches, can lay no
claim to it.</p>
            <p>And it shall be my Business,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> To shew that this cannot be a Note of the
true Church. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Supposing it to be so, that the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> will however gain nothing by it, as to her Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
nor the <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches lose any thing: Nay
on the contrary, that it will quite overthrow her Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension
of being the whole Catholick Church, and do
the <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches as great Service, as <hi>Her</hi> Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> I will briefly shew, that this cannot be a Note
of the true Church. By a <hi>Note</hi> is understood a <hi>distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
Character;</hi> but <hi>this</hi> is such a Character of the
true Church as no one could <hi>less</hi> distinguish it: And
that, whether we consider the Members thereof under,
either the notion of a great <hi>Multitude,</hi> or a great Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of <hi>Believers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Considering them under the Notion of a great <hi>Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi>
the Church which is <hi>Christ's</hi> Kingdom, is far from
being distinguishable as <hi>such</hi> from the Kingdom of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi>
which was always incomparably more numerous:
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:95581:4"/>
Or from that part of it which consisteth of <hi>Idolatrous
Pagans.</hi> What <hi>Romanist</hi> can boast of his <hi>Church,</hi> in
reference to this Note, as <hi>Demetrius</hi> the <hi>Silver-Smith</hi>
did of his <hi>Diana,</hi> when he said, <hi>That all Asia and the
World worshipped her?</hi> Nor can the Church of <hi>Christ</hi> by
the Number of its Members be distinguished from the
Worshippers of that great Impostor <hi>Mahomet;</hi> which
the Sons of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church must especially grant to
be far exceeding the Members of Christ's true Church
in Number, since they make <hi>themselves</hi> the only Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks.</p>
            <p>Again, considering them under the Notion of a great
Multitude of <hi>Believers,</hi> there was an Age in which the
<hi>Orthodox</hi> Christians could not be distinguished from
<hi>Hereticks,</hi> by the greatness of their Number (whom
the <hi>Romanists</hi> will not admit to be Members of the
Church in any sense) for in the Reign of <hi>Arrianism,
ingenuit Orbis &amp; mirabatur &amp;c. The World lamented and
wondred to find it self turned Arrian;</hi> saith St. <hi>Hierom.</hi>
And it became a Proverb, <hi>Athanasius against the whole
World, and the whole World against Athanasius.</hi> And
lastly, the Church of <hi>Christ</hi> is not to be <hi>thus</hi> distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
from the Kingdom of <hi>Antichrist.</hi> I wish our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
could impartially consider, <hi>whose</hi> Note that
of <hi>having Power given him over all Kindreds and Tongues
and Nations</hi> is most likely to be:<note place="margin">Apoc. 13. 7.</note> And <hi>who</hi> it is that is
described by <hi>sitting, as upon seven Hills,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 17. 1.</note> 
               <hi>so upon many
Waters:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vers. 15.</note> Which Waters are <hi>Peoples, and Multitudes,
and Nations, and Tongues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These things considered, nothing is more apparent,
than that the true Church is neither to be distinguished
from other Bodies of Men, or of Professors of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
by the largeness of its Extent, or the Numerous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of its Members; and therefore that a true Note
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:95581:4"/>
thereof cannot result from these. And besides, a true
Note of the Church must be Essential to it, must belong
thereto <hi>as</hi> the true Church, and therefore is inseparable
from it. But how could Amplitude or Multitude, be
ascribed to the true Church in the Time of our <hi>Saviour,</hi>
when he called it <hi>a little Flock,</hi> and said, <hi>Strait is the
Gate and narrow is the Way that leadeth unto Life, and
few there be that find it,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Bellarmin</hi> pretends to fetch this Note of his out
of the <hi>Bible,</hi> and not only to be beholden to <hi>Vincensius
Lyrinensis</hi> for it, whom he first cites in favour of it; tho
little to his Purpose, as will be seen anon. The <hi>Texts</hi>
he produceth are <hi>four; two</hi> in the <hi>Old</hi> Testament and
<hi>two</hi> in the <hi>New.</hi> Those in the <hi>Old</hi> Testament are, <hi>Psal.</hi>
2. 8. Where God the Father promiseth his Son, That
<hi>He will give him the Heathen for his Inheritance, and the
uttermost parts of the Earth for his Possession.</hi> And <hi>Psal.</hi>
72. 8. Where 'tis prophesied, That Christ <hi>shall have
Dominion from Sea to Sea, and from the River unto the
Ends of the Earth.</hi> Those in the <hi>New</hi> Testament are,
<hi>Luke</hi> 24. 47. Where our Lord declareth, That <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and Remission of Sins should be preached in his Name
among all Nations, beginning at Ierusalem.</hi> And <hi>Acts</hi>
1. 8. Where he tells his Apostles, That <hi>they shall receive
Power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon them, and
they shall be Witnesses unto him, both in Ierusalem, and in
all Iudea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost parts of
the Earth.</hi> And it cannot be doubted but that these
Texts do prove, that the Members of Christ's Church
shall be a very vast Multitude, and that its Amplitude
should even extend over all the World. But neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,</p>
            <p>1. It doth not from hence follow, that the Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Amplitude and Multitude doth make a Note,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:95581:5"/>
or distinguishing Character, of Christ's true Church.
It is <hi>one</hi> thing to say, it belongs thereto as an Attribute;
and <hi>another,</hi> that 'tis appropriated to it as a Note. That
may be even Essential to a Thing, which yet is not a
Note of Distinction, or peculiar Property, whereby it
may be known from all <hi>other</hi> Things. The power of
Sensation is essential to a Man, yet for all that, he is
not distinguishable thereby from a Beast. But it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from what hath been discoursed, that the true
Church is not to be distinguish'd from the Kingdom of
<hi>Satan,</hi> nor of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> nor from <hi>Erroneous Sects,</hi> by
Amplitude and Multitude: And that these together, or
apart, are not so much as Essential to the Church of
Christ; since there was a time when, as hath been said,
it was without them both.</p>
            <p>2. This is so far from being a Note of the Church,
that 'tis no more than a variable State and Condition
thereof; since it hath had, from time to time, its Ebbs
and Flows, and hath had sometimes larger, and other
times straiter and narrower Bounds. This the <hi>Cardinal</hi>
was aware of, and therefore, among other things he
would have to be observed for the right understanding
of this his Note, he saith, That <hi>Although the Church
ought not necessarily to be in all places at the same time, yet
now it ought necessarily to be, or to have been, in the greater
part of the World: For 'tis acknowledged by all, even the
Hereticks themselves</hi> (meaning the Protestants) <hi>that the
Church is now in her old Age, and therefore must be past
growing.</hi> By the way; though all his Hereticks, no
doubt, do believe that the Church hath daily grown
elder and elder, yet I know not how many he hath found
asserting, that she is now arrived at old Age. But it
will by no means be granted him, that the Church is
yet grown so old as to be past growing, or to have a
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:95581:5"/>
period put to its time of Encreasing. And therefore I
add,</p>
            <p>3. That we have great Assurance that the Church
hitherto hath not deserved to be compared with what
it shall be before the end of the World, both in respect
of its Amplitude, and the number of Believers. For
there are very many plain Prophecies from whence this
may certainly be concluded; which all, that without
prejudice consider them, must needs be satisfied, have
not hitherto been accomplished. Namely, those which
have reference to the <hi>Calling of the Iews,</hi> and the <hi>bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in of the fulness of the Gentiles,</hi> and <hi>the most plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Effusion of the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>perfect rest from Persecution,</hi>
and <hi>universal Peace,</hi> with the most wonderful outward
Prosperity of the Church. There are, I say, abundance
of the plainest Predictions and Promises of this Nature,
which the Church hath not as yet experimented the
performance of; and they are expressed in such Words
as that it may reasonably be believed, that those great
things which God hath heretofore done for his Church,
either <hi>Iewish</hi> or <hi>Christian,</hi> are no better than Types and
Emblems of what he intends to do, in His appointed
time. Among those Predictions and Promises, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
may consult these following, which are but a few
in comparison of the whole Number, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Old
Testament, <hi>Psal. 22. 27 to 31. Isa. 2. 1 to 6. Chap. 11.
throughout. Ier. 32. 37 to 43. Chap. 33. 7 to the end.
Dan.</hi> 7. 13, 14. And in the New Testament, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.
14. <hi>Rom. 11. 12. and ver. 25 to 33. 2 Cor.</hi> 3. 15, 16.
<hi>Apoc. 20. 1 to</hi> 7. Though the fulfilling of these Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
hath been deferred for so many Ages, yet He is
<hi>Faithful that hath promised</hi> so glorious an encrease of His
Church, with the other unspeakable Blessings now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
and will fulfil them when the Time is come
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:95581:6"/>
which His infinite Wisdom knows to be the fittest for
that Purpose.</p>
            <p>And thus much may suffice to be said in reference to
the Cardinal's proving this Note by <hi>Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As to those Words, in the next place, of</hi> Vincensius
Lyrinensis, <hi>in his</hi> Commonitorium, <hi>which he produceth
for the confirming thereof, viz.</hi> Eos propriè esse Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos,
qui tenent id quod semper, quod ubique, quod ab omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
creditum est. Those are properly Catholicks, who hold
that which hath been always, every where, and by all believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<hi>I answer,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That <hi>Vincensius</hi> doth not pretend to give us, in
these Words, a Note of the Catholick <hi>Church,</hi> but of
such a <hi>Christian.</hi> This is evident at first sight: And so
is this,</p>
            <p>2. Whereas he makes it the Character of a true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,
to hold what hath been believed <hi>semper, ubique
&amp; omnibus,</hi> it cannot be hence inferred, that he believed
Amplitude, or a Multitude of Believers to be so much
as an Attribute of the Catholick Church; and therefore
much less a Note.</p>
            <p>3. If these Words lay down a true Note of a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Christian, then no Body of Christians can be more
evidently proved to be no true Catholicks, than those
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion may, in all those Articles of
Faith which are peculiar to themselves. For, as to Points
of mere Belief, how much more than the <hi>Apostles Creed</hi>
can they shew us to have been received, <hi>always, every
where, and by all Christians?</hi> But as for that large Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Tridentine</hi> Articles, annexed to that Creed by
P. <hi>Pius</hi> the 4<hi>th,</hi> no unbiassed Person can believe, they
have ever done any thing <hi>like</hi> proving, that any of them
have been received <hi>always,</hi> and much less <hi>every where,</hi>
and by all those whom themselves own for Catholick
Christians.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:95581:6"/>
4. By this Note of a Catholick, no Society of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
can bid so fair for Catholicism, as the Reformed
Churches, but especially the Church of <hi>England;</hi> whose
avowed Principle it is, <hi>to receive nothing as an Article of
Faith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Artic. 6.</note> 
               <hi>but what is contained in the holy Scriptures, or may
be proved thereby.</hi> Nor doth she embrace any one Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
as an <hi>Article of Faith,</hi> but what is clearly expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in those Books, of whose Canonicalness there never
was the least Dispute in the Primitive Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> I proceed to shew that if we should acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
this to be a true Note of the Catholick Church; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of enabling the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to make good
her Pretension of so being, it will destroy it: And instead
of doing Disservice to the Reformed Churches, it will
do them excellent Service, and be a certain Argument
of their being true Parts of the Catholick Church. And,</p>
            <p>1. I will shew that it will not at all Advantage the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as to that her Pretension, and therefore
can do <hi>us</hi> no Prejudice. The Cardinal proves,</p>
            <p>(1.) That his Church began to fructify throughout the
World in the Days of the Apostles, <hi>from these Words of
St.</hi> Paul, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 6. The Truth of the Gospel is come unto
you, as it is in all the World, and bringeth forth Fruit, as
it doth also in you, <hi>&amp;c. But what is this to</hi> his <hi>Church?
Is the Gospel's bringing forth Fruit in all the World, the
same thing with the Church of</hi> Rome<hi>'s so doing?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(2.) He adds the Authority of several <hi>Fathers,</hi> for
this Church's being spread in <hi>their</hi> Time, all over the
then known World, but gives us none of their Sayings
except St. <hi>Prosper</hi>'s. The first Father he cites is St. <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,</hi>
in the 3<hi>d</hi> Chapter of his Book.<note place="margin">Edit. <hi>Paris.</hi> P. 53.</note> But the Father
here only saith, <hi>That this Faith</hi> (which he sums up
immediately before, and is but the chief part of the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:95581:7"/>
               <hi>Apostle's Creed) the Church disseminated throughout the
World diligently preserves, as if it were confined but to one
House.</hi> But how doth this concern the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi>
Which is not once mentioned with others here parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
named; except we could be made to believe
that wheresoever the Word <hi>Church</hi> is found, <hi>that</hi> Church
is still to be understood. Next he cites <hi>Tertullian adversùs
Iudaeos,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Edit. <hi>Rig.</hi> p. 189.</note> and having search'd that Book, <hi>these,</hi> or <hi>none,</hi>
are the Words he means, viz. <hi>Those Words of</hi> David
<hi>are to be understood of the</hi> Apostle's, <hi>their Sound is gone
forth in all the Earth, and their Words unto the End of the
World: For in whom have all Nations believed, but in</hi>
Christ, <hi>who is now come? The</hi> Parthians, Medes, Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,
<hi>and those that inhabit</hi> Mesopotamia, Armenia,
Phrygia, Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia <hi>and</hi> Pamphilia, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,
Africa, <hi>and beyond</hi> Cyrene, <hi>the</hi> Romans <hi>and</hi> Jews
<hi>now in</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>and other Nations; as now of the</hi> Getu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li
<hi>and</hi> Moors, <hi>all</hi> Spain, <hi>divers Countries of the</hi> Gauls,
<hi>and those of the</hi> Britains, <hi>which the</hi> Romans <hi>could never
conquer, are subject to Christ,</hi> &amp;c. But I again ask, What
is all this to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> more than to any
other particular Church belonging to any one of the
many Nations, of which that of the <hi>Romans</hi> is one,
and two whole Quarters of the World, here mentioned?
His <hi>third Father</hi> is St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Edit. <hi>Oxon.</hi> p. 108.</note> in his Book <hi>de Vnitate
Ecclesiae.</hi> But here is nothing he could fancy to be for
his purpose, except <hi>these</hi> Words: <hi>The Church is one,
which by its Fruitfulness is extended into a Multitude; As
there are many Rays of the Sun, and but one Light,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>So
the Church of our Lord, which being filled with Light, sends
forth her Beams through the whole World, is but one Light,
which is diffused every-where.</hi> But though this be said of
the Catholick Church; is here the least Intimation that
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is this Catholick Church? After
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:95581:7"/>
St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> follow several of the <hi>later Fathers,</hi> their
Books being only directed to. But the narrow room I
am confined to, will not permit me to examine them;
nor need we look any farther to be satisfied, how this
greatest Man of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church condescended to the
most shameful impertinence, in citing Scripture and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
for the doing her Service. But we must not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look
St. <hi>Prosper</hi>'s Verses, in his Book <hi>de Ingratis, viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>Sedes Roma Petri, quae Pastoralis Honoris</l>
               <l>Facta Caput Mundo, quicquid non possidet Armis,</l>
               <l>Relligione tenet—i. e.</l>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Rome</hi> the Seat of <hi>Peter,</hi> being made the Head of Pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Honour in the World; whatsoever Country she pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesseth
not by her Arms, she holds by her Religion.</p>
            <p>But, considering how early this Father lived, <hi>viz.</hi>
about the beginning of the <hi>Fifth Century,</hi> he could mean
no more than <hi>this,</hi> That the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the most
Honourable of all other (by means of that Cities being
the ancient Seat of the Emperors) keeps still possession
of those places by the Religion they received from Her,
over which she hath lost Her Old Dominion. And
what is this, but <hi>another</hi> plain Instance, of most idle
quoting of Ancient Authors? Not to reflect upon <hi>Fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Arguments from Poetical Flourishes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, not to stand to consider <hi>how</hi> Ample the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church was in the times of those Fathers, nothing is
more evident, than that <hi>that</hi> part of Christendom she
took up, was but a small Spot of Ground compared with
the Space <hi>those</hi> Churches filled; which, tho they held
Communion with Her, were <hi>distinct</hi> Churches from
Her, and owned no Subjection to Her. And it was about
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:95581:8"/>
or above, an <hi>Hundred</hi> Years after the <hi>youngest</hi> of those
Fathers, that the Pope was invested by that Execrable
Wretch <hi>Phocas</hi> (a Blessed Title in the mean time) with
the Primacy over all Churches. And <hi>Gregory the Great,</hi>
who died in the Beginning of the <hi>Sixth</hi> Century, not
only sharply inveighed against <hi>Iohn</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi>
and his Successor <hi>Cyriacus,</hi> for assuming to
themselves the Title of <hi>Vniversal Bishops</hi> (though there
was no appearance of their designing any thing more
thereby, than an Addition of <hi>Honour</hi> (not of <hi>Power</hi>) to
that Patriarchate) but also called those who should affect
such a Haughty Title,<note place="margin">Greg. Epist. 37. &amp; 70. <hi>lib.</hi> 11. &amp; Ep. 30. <hi>l.</hi> 4.</note> the <hi>Forerunners of Antichrist.</hi>
And, as these Bishops taking this Title, was a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
that they acknowledged not the least Subjection
to the Bishops of <hi>Rome;</hi> so Pope <hi>Gregory</hi>'s calling those
Bishops who should so do, without Exception, <hi>Forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of Antichrist,</hi> is as plain a Proof, that the Bishops
of <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>his</hi> time, did not look on themselves as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a Primacy over all Churches. And 'tis manifest
that in the time of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> was not thought to include the Catholick Church,
or to be any more than one part thereof: This, I say, is
manifest from the <hi>Sixth Canon</hi> of that Council, viz. <hi>Let
the ancient Customs be preserved, for the Bishop of</hi> Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria
<hi>to have Iurisdiction over</hi> Egypt, Lybia and Pentapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis;
<hi>because the Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>hath a like Custom, &amp;c.</hi>
Which is as much as to say, that the Bishop of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi>
had then the same uncontroulable Power in his large
Jurisdiction, that the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> had in <hi>his.</hi> And
therefore <hi>that</hi> Council knew nothing of <hi>this</hi> Bishop's ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
any Power over the <hi>Alexandrian,</hi> and much less
over the <hi>whole Catholick</hi> Church. Nor is any thing
more certain, than that the mere Superiority of <hi>Honour,</hi>
which the <hi>Roman</hi> Church had, was founded on no Divine
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:95581:8"/>
Right, but only on <hi>that Cities</hi> being the Seat of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.
For, as the <hi>Second General Council,</hi> viz. that of
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> decreed in its <hi>Third Canon,</hi> That the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Constantinople</hi> should have the priviledg of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<hi>next</hi> to the Bishop of <hi>Rome;</hi> upon the account of
its being the Imperial City, and therefore called <hi>New
Rome:</hi> So in the <hi>Twenty eighth Canon</hi> of the <hi>Fourth Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Council, viz.</hi> that of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> it was ordained,
that for the <hi>same</hi> Reason, the Bishop of <hi>Constantinople</hi>
should have <hi>equal</hi> priviledges with the Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi>
So that 'tis a plain Case, that whosoever shall undertake
to prove from any Sayings of the Ancients, for the first
500 Years at least, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and the
<hi>Catholick</hi> Church were reputed to be the <hi>same,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
that whatsoever they said of the Amplitude of
<hi>this</hi> is to be understood of <hi>that</hi> Church, must necessarily
make as sad work of it, as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> hath here done.
And therefore it is apparent too, that no Service can be
done to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by this <hi>Note,</hi> as to her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension
of being the true, Catholick Church: From
whence it will likewise follow, that no <hi>prejudice</hi> can
from thence accrue to the <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches. But this
is not all; For,</p>
            <p>2. This Note, were it a true one, would be <hi>Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive</hi>
to that her Pretence, and do the Reformed Churches
great <hi>Service, viz.</hi> in demonstrating them to be true
parts of the Catholick Church. <hi>This</hi> also may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
from what hath been said, but it will be made
<hi>more</hi> evident by these following Considerations.</p>
            <p>1. If the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had as Ample a Spread over
the World, for some of the first Ages, as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
for, <hi>this</hi> would far more redound to the Advantage
of our Churches of the Reformation (were <hi>Amplitude</hi>
a distinguishing Property of the Church) than to the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:95581:9"/>
Advantage of the present Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> because that
Church <hi>then</hi> was more <hi>ours,</hi> than now it is the <hi>Romanists.</hi>
For there can scarcely be a greater Disagreement in <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>
and <hi>Worship</hi> between any two <hi>Christian</hi> Churches,
than there hath for a long time been between the <hi>same</hi>
Church as she was <hi>then,</hi> and is <hi>now.</hi> But the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is as great between the Ancient Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and <hi>our</hi> Churches; and especially between Her and the
Church of <hi>England.</hi> This our Adversaries could not
but see, would they impartially compare the <hi>Doctrine</hi>
and <hi>Worship</hi> of each together. And the only Quarrel
they have with us, is, that we will not admit more into
<hi>our Creed,</hi> than the Christians of the First Ages did into
<hi>theirs:</hi> And that we worship God only by the alone
Mediation of Jesus Christ, as <hi>they</hi> did: That our Laity
partake of the Communion in both kinds, as <hi>theirs</hi> did.
And, in short, that we believe the Holy Scriptures to be
a compleat Rule of Faith, as it was every where belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be by the Primitive Catholicks; and that we will
not receive into our Worship the <hi>Roman</hi> Novelties;
those things which were utterly unknown to both the
<hi>Roman</hi> and all <hi>other</hi> Churches in <hi>those</hi> Ages.</p>
            <p>Now, whereas the <hi>Cardinal</hi> would have it observed,
for the better explaining the meaning of this Note, <hi>That
if one Province alone should retain the true Faith, it might
properly be called the Catholick Church, so long as its Faith
is one and the same, with that which at one time or other had
prevailed in the whole World:</hi> We desire no greater Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to <hi>our</hi> Church, and all other in Communion
with Her; since <hi>these</hi> and <hi>those</hi> Churches which in the
Primitive Times were extended all over the then known
parts of the World, are agreed in much more than all the
Fundamental Points of Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:95581:9"/>
2. It hath been estimated upon Computation, that the
Churches subject to the <hi>Roman See</hi> exceed not much the
Reformed Churches in Amplitude, or Multitude of
Members:<note place="margin">See the <hi>Preface</hi> to <hi>Brerewood</hi>'s Enquiries.</note> Especially since <hi>Italy, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi>
are detained in the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion, not by Choice or
Judgment, but by Ignorance and the Tyranny of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition.
But who can be ignorant that the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> bears not the least proportion upon those Accounts,
with these Churches considered in <hi>Conjunction</hi> with that
part of Christendom which agreeth with them, as in
all the main Points of Christianity, so in refusing Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to <hi>that</hi> Church; and in most of those Doctrines
and Practices, which we condemn in Her as contrary to
Holy Scripture, or as not founded thereon (and yet
made necessary to Salvation by Her) and not taught by
the Primitive Church? So that should all the Churches
which deny that of <hi>Rome</hi> to have any Authority over
them, deal with <hi>Her</hi> as she hath dealt with <hi>them,</hi> and
pronounce Her to have nothing more left Her than
the mere <hi>Name</hi> of a Church; this Her Note would be
an unanswerable Objection against Her being <hi>A true
Church,</hi> as well as <hi>The true Church;</hi> on supposition that
(as she holds) of two Parties of Christians rejecting Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with, and unchurching each other, but one of
them can be a <hi>true Church.</hi> That so large a part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom,
I say, agrees with the Reformed Churches in
all the Grand Articles of Faith, and in the Chief of those
wherein they are at Varience with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
as makes the whole an incomparably greater Body of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
than all those <hi>together</hi> who own that Church for
their Mother, is so notorious, that 'tis impossible our
Adversaries should dispute it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cardinal</hi> indeed tells us, on this Note, That <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
all</hi> Italy <hi>and</hi> Spain <hi>and almost all</hi> France, <hi>which the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:95581:10"/>
Church of</hi> Rome <hi>possesseth: And besides</hi> Germany, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Poland, Bohemia, Hungary, Greece, Syria, Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia,
Egypt, <hi>in which many Catholicks are found; even
in the New World</hi> (viz. America) <hi>She hath Churches
without the mixture of Hereticks.</hi> And we can Reply,
That Besides, <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> in which
Protestancy is the National Religion; and in the two
former of which, the Number of Papists is very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable:
And besides <hi>Denmark, Norway, Sweden</hi> and
the <hi>Vnited Provinces,</hi> in all which 'tis also the National
Religion: And besides <hi>Germany, Switzerland, Hungary,
Transilvania,</hi> in which are abundance of Protestant
Churches (as there were lately in the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi>
too, and 'twill never be forgot by what Methods they
have been extirpated); Besides all those Countries, I say,
the Protestants have also <hi>their</hi> Churches in the <hi>New
World,</hi> no less <hi>without the mixture of Hereticks:</hi> And
these consist of other kind of Believers than those the
<hi>Romanists</hi> boast of in that Quarter. For, whereas <hi>Surius</hi>
and others have told prodigious Stories of incredible
Numbers of them, that have been baptized by particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Priests; <hi>Acosta,</hi> tho a <hi>Iesuit,</hi> acknowledgeth that

               <hi>Many of them were driven to Baptism as Beasts to the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
And <hi>Oviedo</hi> saith of <hi>Cuba, That there was scarcely any
one, or but extremely few, that willingly became Christians.</hi>
And both <hi>he</hi> and <hi>Benzo,</hi> who were long conversant in
those parts, say of <hi>Cuba</hi> and <hi>New Spain, That they had
scarcely any thing belonging to Christianity, besides the bare
Name of Christians. That they only minded the Name they
received in Baptism, and not long after forgot that too.</hi>
And the <hi>former</hi> of these makes this no matter of Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
since he declares their <hi>Converters</hi> to be no better
Christians than these <hi>Converrts:</hi> And excellently expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulates
with them about the horrible Wickedness of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:95581:10"/>
their Lives; telling them that would they give the poor
<hi>Indians</hi> good Examples, this Method would signify
much more towards the making of them good Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
than <hi>that</hi> Course they took with them. And the
old Monsieur <hi>Arnaud,</hi> in an Assembly at <hi>Paris,</hi> scoffed
at the <hi>Iesuits</hi> for the Conversion of the <hi>Indians;</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
it a brave <hi>warlike Conversion, Conversionem bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam
&amp; bellicosam;</hi> and telling them that they had
converted <hi>Gladium oris in os Gladii.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> in the Words follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those last cited, makes this flourish, <hi>that</hi> Rome
<hi>hath Churches in all the four Parts of the World; to
the</hi> East <hi>in the</hi> Indies, <hi>to the</hi> West <hi>in</hi> America, <hi>to
the</hi> North <hi>in</hi> Japan, <hi>to the</hi> South <hi>in</hi> Brasil, <hi>and the
uttermost Part of</hi> Africa: If his meaning was <hi>more</hi>
than <hi>this,</hi> That there is no Country in all those
Parts, but what hath <hi>Romanists</hi> in it, it was (to
say no worse) a <hi>mere</hi> Flourish: If he meant <hi>no
more</hi> than so, <hi>we</hi> may dare to affirm as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Protestants. But it matters not much whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we can or no, since there are infinite Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Christians, who, though they bear not the
Name of <hi>Protestants,</hi> yet agree with them in not
being <hi>Papists,</hi> and (as was said) in all the great
Points of the Christian Religion; whether of Faith
or Practice.</p>
            <p>To pass by the Christians under the Patriarch

               <hi>Though they are

               <hi>Otho Frisingensis</hi> reports to have under his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
above a <hi>thousand</hi> Bishops,<note place="margin">

Bodies of Christians acknowledg no Subjection to

               </hi> I say, to pass by <hi>these,</hi> we need
not instance in <hi>any</hi> besides the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, for
the foresaid Purpose: Which hath had an uninterrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Succession of Bishops from the Apostles, and is
of greater Antiquity than the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
which hath produced <hi>more Fathers</hi> than <hi>that</hi> Church.
This Church is divided into many Nations, as the
<hi>Hyberians,</hi> the People of <hi>Colchis</hi> (now <hi>Mengrelia</hi>)
the <hi>Arabians, Chaldaeans, Aethiopians, Aegyptians, Mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites,
Bulgarians, Sclavonians, Albanians, Carama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,
Walachians, Moldavians, Graecians,</hi> &amp;c. And
we may guess what a huge Disproportion there is in
Largeness, between all the <hi>Greek</hi> Churches, and
those Subject to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by <hi>this,</hi> That
the Countries in <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> which the <hi>Mosco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites
alone</hi> inhabit, are computed to be near of as
great an extent as <hi>all Europe</hi> besides.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Greek <hi>Church hath</hi> Four Ancient Patriarchs,
<hi>the</hi> Constantinopolitan, <hi>the</hi> Alexandrian, <hi>the</hi> Antiochian,
<hi>and the Patriarch of</hi> Ierusalem. <hi>And since the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchate
of</hi> Constantinople <hi>hath been under the</hi> Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish
<hi>Tyranny, there hath been a</hi> Fifth <hi>Patriarch,</hi> viz.
<hi>of</hi> Mosco. Cyril <hi>Patriarch of</hi> Alexandria, <hi>and since
of</hi> Constantinople, Bellarmin<hi>'s Contemporary, saith of
the</hi> Greek <hi>Church dispersed through the foresaid Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that</hi> They are stedfast in the Faith of Christ:
That no Innovation in Matters of Faith is found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them; and but only some difference in Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.
<note place="margin">Ep. 2. ad. Vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenbogard. inter Ep. praest. Vir. <hi>p. 399. in Octavo.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>He acknowledgeth that some of those Nations
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:95581:11"/>
are not free from Superstition; but adds, that</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
detriment of the Faith it is connived at, because it can't
be remedied, in regard of many Difficulties: But in
those things which belong to the Essence of Faith, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severantes
sunt &amp; permanentes, they are fixed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable.
<hi>He also writes, that</hi> Whereas the Oriental
Churches seem to be Reproached for their Ignorance;
<note place="margin">Ep. 1. ad eun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem. ibid. <hi>p.</hi> 369.</note>
Philosophy and other sorts of Learning being gone from
thence into other parts, since they have been opprest
with many Miseries by reason of the Tyranny of the <hi>Turk,</hi>
yet they reap no small Advantage hereby; because by
this Means they are unacquainted with those Pestiferous
Questions, which at this time infect Mens Ears; and
with the new Monstrous Portentous Doctrines: <hi>And 'tis
plain what Doctrines he chiefly meant. He adds,
that</hi> They are content with incompta Fides,<note place="margin">See the Rvd. Dean <hi>Stilling-fleet</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church from the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi> charge of Heresy. In his Learned Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Bishop <hi>Laud.</hi>
               </note> a plain
undrest Faith, taught them by the Apostles and their
Ancestors, and herein they persevere even unto Blood:
<hi>That</hi> They keep <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> integram, the Faith entirely:
<hi>That</hi> They see themselves bereft of all their Substance,
their Children snatch'd from their Embraces; and are
continually brought into the greatest Tribulations, yet it
is not grievous to them to suffer these things for the
Faith of Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that the <hi>Motto</hi> which <hi>Minutius Felix</hi> made for
the Primitive Christians, <hi>Non magna Loquimur sed
Vivimus; Great things are not so much</hi> Talk'd <hi>as</hi>
Lived <hi>by us:</hi> This Great Prelate (whose Fidelity in
this Account is unquestionable, he being a Person of
as fam'd <hi>Piety</hi> as <hi>Learning</hi>) doth assure us is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
by these <hi>Greek</hi> Christians. But for all this,
They must all be doom'd to Hell Torments, as effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Sentence can do it,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:95581:12"/>
because they will not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Truckle under <hi>Her,</hi> and so be
made subject to a double Bondage.</p>
            <p>And thus have I sufficiently shewed, That it
would be for the <hi>Interest</hi> of the Reformed Churches,
that Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s <hi>Fourth Note</hi> of the Church
were as <hi>true</hi> as we have proved it false: And that
it would then <hi>overthrow</hi> instead of <hi>establishing</hi> the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi>'s marvellous Pretence of being <hi>The</hi>
True or Catholick Church.</p>
