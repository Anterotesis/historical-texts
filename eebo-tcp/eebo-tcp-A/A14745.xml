         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

wee say not, Are you lame? but, Haue
you no eyes? or, Can you not see? What
euer sweruings or stumblings any part of
the body politique makes, the blame lights
not vpon the Gentry or Comminalty, the
immediate delinquents, but on the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
lights in <hi>Magistracy</hi> or <hi>Ministery,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3188:3"/>
which being as Guardians and Tutors of
the rest, should either preuent or reforme
their aberrations. And herein miserable
is the condition of these two opticke pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that they are more subiect, and that
to more distempers then other inferiour
parts: yet heerein more, that being hurt,
they are more impatient of cure; not only
of searching acrimonious waters (which
yet oft are needefull) but shie of the most
soft and lawny touches: but most of all in
this, that being once extinct, they leaue a
voyd darknesse to the whole body, expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
it to the pits of destruction. As ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
great on the other hand, is the
happines, honor &amp; vse of them, if cleere
and single. For this our Nationall body,
it will little boot either to applaud the
one, or to bewaile the other: I rather wish
and looke about mee for some eye-salue,
which may help to descry and redresse, if
any thing bee amisse. And behold heere
(Right Honourable) a confection poomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
something thereto: It was prescribed
first by <hi>Iethro,</hi> whom <hi>Moses</hi> calls the
<pb facs="tcp:3188:3"/>
               <hi>eyes of Israel,</hi> Num. 10. 31. And newly
compounded by an Oculist, of whom as I
may not, so I need not say any thing at all.
Next vnder the sacred Fountaine of
light (the light of our Israel) I worthily
accompt your Lordship most sufficient in
law to accept, to make vse, to iudge, to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronize
it. The subiect of the booke is the
principall obiect of your office, to elect,
direct and correct inferiour Magistracy.
To which purposes, Nature, Literature
and Grace haue inabled you, that if you
should faile the worlds expectation, they
will hardly trust any other in hasle. Many
in rising haue followed the stirrop, pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
and ietting honor not standing the
ground, but once seated haue done re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nownedly.
But your Lordship had neuer
any other greeces then your birth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert;
to which, hereditary dignity hath
so gently tendred it selfe, that you haue
not let fal your name of religion in getting
vp. Therefore now you are in the top of
honour, all that know you, looke you will
bee exactly honourable. For my part,
<pb facs="tcp:3188:4"/>
bounden to your Lordship for a fauour
formerly receiued, greater then your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
knowes of, or I can expresse: I shall
leaue <hi>Iethro</hi> to be your Montoir, and my
self remain euer an humble suitor to God,
who hath made you a Iudge of conscience,
that hee would make you continue a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionable
Iudge, improouing your place
and abilities to the best aduantage belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
to it, the furtherance of your recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

            <p>BRother, if you meet with your <hi>Iethro's</hi> counsell
returned from beyond the seas, and as much
beyond your expectation preserued aliue, as his
sonne in law was against <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Iniunction, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
as much as you will, but bee no more offended
then you haue cause. <hi>Ioab</hi> sinned wider on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hand in destroying <hi>Dauids Absolom,</hi> contrary
to his serious charge, yet <hi>Ioab</hi> was pardoned, and
yet no brother. I haue noted you hitherto inexora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for your owne publishing of any thing of your
owne; whether out of iudgement, modesty, curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
or melancholy, I iudge not: but when others
haue aduentured them with fruit and acceptance,
into the light, I haue seene you rest content with
the publique good The like leaue I haue taken,
expecting like successe, assuring you and my selfe
of the generall welcomnesse and vsefulnesse heerof
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:3188:40"/>
to all whom it concernes, which are the greatest
number of the land, euen so many as haue any refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to Sessions and Assises, if not all sorts of
Christians. Onely I feare that the corruption of
our times is growne so grosse and <hi>Eglon</hi>-like, that
it doth not <hi>Ebud</hi>-like enough sharpen the poynts,
and send them home to the heft, that they may
reach to the quicke. I had my selfe added thereto a
proiect and perswasion for the redresse of many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses
crept into offices and officers, hauing spent
so much time in the study of the law, and execution
of some offices, as made me weary of the errours I
saw, and heartily wish the reformation of them:
but fearing I haue learned too much bluntnesse &amp;
plumpnesse of speech among the Lutherans, which
is here as prime a quality, as smoothnes with you,
as also loth to meddle out of mine orb, in my se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
thoughts I suppressed it. And so wishing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this, many diligent, conscionable and ingenuous
Readers and Appliers, and to them Gods blessing
and the fruit intended, I take my leaue. From <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing</hi>
