            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Have always thought it my Duty upon these solemn Meetings to say something, that might be most proper for your Notice: And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there has rarely been a Time that afforded greater Variety of unhappy Circumstances than these we now labour under. For we are divided into so many and such pernicious Principles; that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the gracious Assistance of the Almighty to our utmost Care for the rooting of them out, they will inevitably ruin both Church and State. Obedience, Truth and Sincerity; Quietness, Peace and Love, are no longer the measures of Civil and Religious Behaviour: but a noisie pretence of Liberty, has, with too many, broken both the Tables.</p>
            <p>If therefore I entertain you a little longer than ordinary with such Discourse as may call to your

minds those good, but forgotten, Rules of former Times, to encounter so universal a Depravation, as we are at present involved in: I hope you will bear with me. For it is absolutely necessary, where ye have so many obstinate Enemies to encounter, that ye muster up all your Forces, and put them in the best posture of Service for all Occasions.</p>
            <p>I shall direct what I have to say by St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words to <hi>Timothy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16.</note> 
               <hi>Take heed unto thy self, and unto thy Doctrine.</hi> Which tho' written to a Bishop, are as justly applicable to any who <hi>minister about holy things.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>I. The first of which words, <hi>Take heed unto thy self,</hi> directs 1. To your Vertuous and Godly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation in general, as well, as 2. To your special duty of walking orderly in the House of God.
<p n="1">1. And reason good: Since a sober and good Life is so extreamly necessary for the Edification of your Flocks. For what an Awe and Reverence do we find an Upright Man to gain upon those that behold his Conversation! The shining Light of a Righteous Man so discovers the shamefulness of the ways of Sinners; that they are confounded to see their own Filthiness, and from that time often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence true Penitents. Therefore St. <hi>Peter</hi> seems to take it for granted, that it was the sure and tryed way to win the Wicked to a Holy Life, by leading such a one themselves.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.12.</note> 
                     <hi>Abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul; having your conversation honest amongst the Gentiles. That whereas they speak


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93370:3"/>
against you as evil doers; they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorifie God in the day of Visitation.</hi> According to the words of our blessed Saviour; <hi>Let your light so shine before men,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>that they may see your good works, and glorifie your Father which is in heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it stands to all Reason in the World that it should be so. For it puts Life into the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and makes Religion truly active; it raises it from the dead Letter to a living Sacrifice, and cloaths it through the sanctifying Spirit with the Beauty of Holiness.</p>
                  <p>Besides it is natural for them that are habituated to do Evil, to fancy it an impossible thing to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Law, they having never experienced the Practice, and their minds having been always ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enated from the knowledge and understanding of it. In which opinion they would be mightily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, should they find the Teachers of the Gospel not walking according to their own Rules. For they will then cheerfully conclude, that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Holiness were given only for a Testimony of the Gospel Purity, and to hold forth the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Excellence of Gods Law: not in the least to oblige Men to the Observation of it. And they have this ready Answer to put off all such unsancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Teachers,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Nonne flagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium est, te altis consili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um dare, Foris sapere, tibi non posse auxiliarier?</hi> Terent.</note>

                  <p>Tho' ye should lay Line upon Line, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept upon Precept: if you should not live up to your own Doctrine, there would be as small hopes

of Success, as of Gods Blessing. For, since all things turn by Providence, with what face can a sinner, a persevering sinner, expect that either his Prayers should be heard, or his Endeavours prosper? For <hi>the Lord is far from the wicked:</hi>

                     <hi>but he heareth the prayer of the righteous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I leave it therefore to you, my Brethren, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider with your selves, whether you find people in these days so meek, so gentle, so easie to be intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; as not to need the best instructed and disposed Teachers, and the most artificial in that Guile, with which St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Corinthians</hi> he craftily caught them.<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.16.</note> And if ye do not meet with so tractable a Generation as may tempt you to be remiss; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you for your own sakes, and for theirs that are committed to your Charge, not to faint in well doing, since your Reward is certain. Especially since there is no surer a way to put to silence those that dissent from us; who are too apt to judge of the sincerity of our Doctrine from that of our Lives.</p>

But the certain effect of drawing several ways in our course of Worship, will be a coldness of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from the difference of Minds, and that soon improves into Strife and Contention. For when Men set their Hearts upon any thing that meets with Opposition, they are presently in a Flame, as not enduring to be thought in the Wrong. This is so evident through the whole Conversation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that he must wink very hard that sees it not. What Heats, what Animosities, nay many times what Enmities, what Contentions, what Wars have ensued upon Differences in very Trifles! Now by how much the greater the Consequence is of the Matter in debate, so much the warmer prove the train of Passions raised upon it; and the more in earnest a Man is, the apter is he to be froward, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if he get into a Wrong way: For,<note place="margin">

For the Holy Scripture is so clear in this Point, that even the Old Testament, which is made up of Types and Figures, Rites and Ceremonies, and of Gods own Appointment; yet admitted of Changes, Additions and Alterations: the Authority of which Practice, our Saviour himself confirms by his own Communion with them. The several Orders and Classes of the Priests and Levites appointed by the Kings of <hi>Iuda</hi> continued till that day.<note place="margin">

            <p>When the Shadows were vanished away and the Substance was come, then were Rites and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies no more a part of Religion; but only so far in use, as the necessity of Decency and Order re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, in the Judgment of those who had the Rule over the Church; so that from a direct Obligation upon the Conscience, they became only relatively so.

            <p>However there is a Just and Decent Liberty due to all Christians, whereby to Judge for themselves in the Essentials of Religion. But yet such a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty it is, as is beset on each hand with most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Rocks; such as threaten Shipwrack to any Vessel that shall Strike upon them. For if on the one hand we run into that Popish Extreme, to take away all Liberty by an absolutely blind Obedience and implicite Faith, swallowing down all that is given, without Tasting or Chewing upon it; we act more like Beasts than Men, and as easily take down Poyson as wholesom Food: but on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, if with the Fanatick we assume to our selves an unlimited Power of following the <hi>Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goose-Chase</hi> of our wanton and uncertain Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; we shall Tear the Church in Ten Thousand Pieces, and expose it to all Uncharitableness. And therefore a Sober Christian tempers all his Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with Modesty and Humility; and has that discreet Jealousie of himself, as wherever he breaks Communion, to do it upon so certain Grounds, that the Grievousness of the Error imposed, or the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93370:11"/>
of the Fact commanded, shall be Notorious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evident. Otherwise, in the Meekness of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he defers to the Judgment of his Neighbours rather than to his own; and thinks himself in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty, in common Discretion, and in Duty bound for the sake of Peace, Unity and Concord, to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Determination of his Superiours, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in Authoritative Assemblies.<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>Indeed it is want either of Judgment or Honesty, that makes Men give in so much to their own O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, and so little to those of others. For it is certain the chief End of our being Conversable and Sociable Creatures was, that we might be Assisting one to another; and the more Important and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal the Subject is, the greater regard ought to be had to its Determination. So that not only in Things Indifferent, where it is absolutely our Duty to submit; but much more in the Weightiest Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Law, where our Eternal Welfare is so immediately concerned, we ought with the greatest Care and Caution to Proceed, and never think we can take too much Advice.</p>

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93370:11"/>
Doubts and Questions so Confound the Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Men oftentimes, that it is very hard for them to come to a Resolution of themselves. And in that Case there is no other way to come to the Acknowledgment of the Truth, but by a Prudent Deference to Authority. For we cannot well ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it Consistent with the Divine Goodness and Wisdom, to suffer an Error so to Prevail, or rather to Reign so absolutely in his Church, as to bear these three Atchievments. I question whether ever any Heresie attained completely to any one of them. St. <hi>Ierom</hi> ye know indeed says, <note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>The World wondred to find it self become Arian.</hi> But this Expression must be taken, as generally such are, by a Trope of the whole, for the greatest, or at least most Noisie Part. For it it evident from all the Accounts given us of those Days, that there were many bore <note n="‖" place="margin">

               </note> Witness for the Truth even to the Death: and more would have done so, if their Courage would have served. Besides that [at all Times] was wanting. It was an Upstart Heresie, that lasted no longer than Supported by Force and Violence; which bears no great Analogy with Gods Methods in Propagating the Gospel. But Popery seems to lay the greatest Claim to this Character of Orthodoxy; and yet when thoroughly consider'd, the largest Part of it goes off in Pomp and Noise. For its Extent was confin'd within <hi>Europe,</hi> all the Churches in <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> disowning it: and there still remain'd in the heighth of their Triumph, Bodies of Men that


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93370:12"/>
Opposed their Superstitions, and many of them with their Blood Sealed to the Truth: Besides, its Reign is not near of that Length it pretends to. The continual Attempts it made upon the Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of other Churches and the aiming at Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality were long in agitation, and never yet settled to their mind farther than in <hi>Italy,</hi> and there next door it is rejected in <hi>Sicily.</hi> Its Pernicious Errours have generally been Disowned by their soundest Members, and by their greatest and ablest Writers, and few Established by Authority till the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> after the Reformation was begun; as you may see amongst others in our excellent Dr. <hi>Field</hi> of the Church. Yet these and all other Considerations, do not Captivate a good Christian so as to make him lay aside all his Reason: but in the midst of Miracles and the Power of the Holy Ghost,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 17.11.</note> with the Noble <hi>Bereans,</hi> search the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture whether Things be so or no. How sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would our Schisms Vanish away, were some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us so Ingenuous, as to go to the Fountain-Head to Search the Scriptures; and not have Mens Persons so much in Admiration, as to take all for Gospel that they say.</p>
            <p>Ye see then the modest Cautiousness, which ought to be used to confirm us in the Truth: lest either by too much Implicitness we suffer Error to grow upon us; or by Assuming too much to our selves, we be Misled by our own Indiscretion.

But what Episcopal Determinations have been, or are made since the Canon of the Holy Scriptures has been confirm'd, may, if they appear Faulty, be Corrected, either by a Hand happily more Skilful, or by the Authority and Prudence of more Bishops and Wiser Men, or by Councils.

He shews plainly enough how easily he would have alter'd his Opinion, if any one had made it appear to him, that Christian Baptism might be Administred to others by those who left the Church for the same Reason, that they cannot lose their own by their Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

this. For it is an unmannerly Trespass upon our Governours and Superiours, to pretend to correct their Style, and in a Private Capacity to be wiser than the multitude of Counsellours. Besides the Confusion and Uncertainty it creates in the Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of the Sense of Doctrines thus delivered. For every Art and Science, has its peculiar Terms and Expressions confin'd to one peculiar Sense and Meaning, so fixed by long Use and Experience; and if that be once passed by, and a Liberty taken by the several Professours, to use the Various Words and Loose Expressions of Common Conversation and Entertainment, or which may otherwise be the Original Propriety of the Language; all Points and Cases will become Unintelligible, through Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guities and Difference of Acceptation. Should we put <hi>Coetus</hi> for <hi>Ecclesia</hi> in the different Senses apply'd in our Ecclesiastical Style, what a Confusion would it make; the former being never otherwise under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood than for a Company of Men met together, whereas the latter is extended to the utmost Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it can bear: For sometimes it is taken for the Material Church, sometimes for a Congregation; and that either of one Parish or Collectively of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as the Church of <hi>England</hi>; or farther, for the whole Body of Christians throughout the World; or yet more extensively, for the Church Triumphant as well as Militant. Should we Change the <hi>English</hi> Word <hi>Church</hi> into any other Expression, what Work


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93370:16"/>
would it make! For though it properly signifie the Material Edifice or Building, as being Deriv'd from the Greek Word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, yet by a most exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Metonymie, is it used in as large a Sense as <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesia</hi> in the Latin. Were <hi>Comitia</hi> apply'd instead of <hi>Concilium,</hi> how uncoothly and strangely would it, for want of Use, suit with the Epithets of Provincial, National, Patriarchal, Ecumenical, and the like. <hi>Castalio</hi> has Translated the Bible into a <hi>Ciceronian</hi> Style; but he is blamed for it by all who have weighed the Inconvenience of such a Novelty.</item>
            </list>
            <p>And yet there would not be so much Hurt in this, if the Mischief reached no farther than an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Singularity. But they who stop here, serve only for Blinds to give a more easie Introduction to Heresie. For under New and Unusual Terms, the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks Equivocate their Meaning; and are content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Manage the Simple-hearted in the best Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they can, till they find a proper Season to speak out. Thus did the Hereticks of old, couch their Errors under Dubious Expressions and Colourable Words. So did the <hi>Arians, Pelagius, Nestorius</hi> and <hi>Eutyches</hi>; as may be seen in the Records of the Church.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I come now to the other Direction, <hi>Rightly dividing the word of truth.</hi> And I take this Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ours to come the fullest up to the Sense of the Original,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> of any in what Language soever. The Import of which Words I take to be,
<list>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:93370:16"/>
                  <item>1. An Advice of Discretion, to Administer the Word according to the Capacity and Strength of the Hearer.</item>
                  <item>2. An Advice of Justice; to make known the whole Mind of God, concealing no Part, but giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to every Portion its due Weight.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. In the first Sense, the Expression seems to have relation to the Distribution of a Sacrifice cut of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into due Proportions. For we know the Body of the Church is likened to the Body Natural, which consists of several Members under different Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons according to their respective Uses. Therefore as in the Natural, so in the Politick. Body there must be regard had to the different Office and Constitution of each Member. Some are more of less Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, some more or less Necessary, some more or less Powerful; each is to be Treated in that way which is most suitable to its Disposition; and if any Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber be Sick or Weak, proper Remedies must be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd. And I am sure however it be Practised, it is one of the most necessary Duties incumbent upon our Calling.</p>
            <p>The Truth of it is, where there is a Cure of Souls, by which a constant Attendance upon the Word in one certain Place is Required; nothing can more express the True and Earnest Concern for their Good, than a diligent Observation of what sort of Treatment, Gentle or Severe; or what sort of Diet may be most Proper for them, Milk or strong Meat. For that which is one Mans Meat may prove ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93370:17"/>
Mans Poyson. Men of sober and serious Spirits, well Exercised in Pious Meditations, may safely be Entertained with the stronger Meats; and Doctrines of high Speculations, and Mysteries may be Trusted with some of them: but such Fare would make the Ordinary sort of Mankind, who for want of Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Leisure are not used to such Sublime Thoughts, run Mad and become Enthusiasts. It is therefore an unpardonable Imprudence in those that Preach to their People at all Adventures. It is as if a Physician should Prescribe to his Patient the first Medicine that came into his Head, without Examining Disease or Temper; whereby it would be infinite Odds that he did more Hurt than Good.</p>
            <p>What then shall we say to such, as out of a base Awe of losing either Favour or Profit, avoid declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Useful and Necessary Truths? What shall we think of those, who Amuse People with Notional and Mysterious Doctrines, holding back such Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical Duties as would keep the Conscience awake; and all this to carry on Factious and Seditious Ends? No doubt an indifferent Person will say, they are of the number of those that <hi>handle the word of God deceitfully.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. Wherefore to avoid the Imputation, either of Heedlesness, or Corrupt and Sinister Designs; as Faithful Stewards ye ought to Acquaint those that are committed to your Charge with the whole Mind of God, lest any thing be wanting to prevent Error or Mistake. Another Method may rid our hands of some Work, but will certainly render our Labour


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93370:17"/>
very Defective if not Pernicious. The Church, which is the Body of Christ, is, ye know, compared to the Natural Body, which has its Members of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Value and Consideration; and as its Members, so have the several Rules and Directions of its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution their respective Weight and Importance: so that neither in the one Case nor in the other, is there a complete Body where any Part is wanting. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the fatal Case of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi>: For if for keeping back a Portion of Temporal Things, which Perish in the Usage, the Punishment was so Severe; of how much greater Infliction shall they be found Worthy, who withold Spiritual Things, which are Eternal! In this Case therefore Comparison is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Odious, where the Value of the greater Articles of our Religion, are apply'd wholly to Eclipse the les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser: For to repeat our Saviour's Rule once more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Occasion, <hi>These things ought ye to do, and not to leave the other undone.</hi> Which makes it far more Wise to follow the Example of that great Apostle of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> alledged in his Farewel Charge at <hi>Miletus,</hi> to the Elders of the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>I kept back nothing that was profitable to you. I have not shamed to declare unto you all the counsel of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus are ye to Instruct the People committed to your Charge. 1. In the more weighty Matters of the Law, thereby to make sure the Foundation. 2. With more especial Earnestness in those Points, where ye find a failure either through Ignorance or Prejudice. 3. And Lastly, in the whole Mind of God,


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93370:18"/>
that they may be Perfect, throughly furnished unto all Good Works.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to the Practical part of Doctrine, one would think the suitableness of all Vertue to the whole Frame and Constitution of Gods Creation, would convince Men of the Reasonableness of it; and the Good it does from its very Nature not only to Particulars, but to the happy Support of the Whole, would make Men in love with it:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eos, quos nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam vidimus propter probi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem &amp; vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutem quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dammodo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligimus.</hi> Cic. de Amicitiâ.</note> And yet for all this, such is our Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and the Power of it, that neither the Light of Nature nor Instruction, Fear nor Favour, Interest nor Danger, can stop the Career of Sin, or turn the Sinner into the Right way. If Conscience cannot be Hardned, at least it shall be laid Asleep with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Promises of Peace and Indulgence. Therefore ye ought earnestly to press the Practice of all Vertues in Holiness of Life: But this ye must be careful to do in such a Christian Style, as may not Offend the Gospel either,

                  <item>I. In coming short of its Precepts; or</item>

            <p>First. For if you Narrow them to the private Dealings betwixt Man and Man, or the Sober Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of our own Persons; do we not see the Sons of Tumult and Sedition, in shew at least, justifie the Duty of such a Behaviour? Neither the Moral Schemes of Philosophers, nor <hi>Crellius</hi>'s <hi>Ethicks</hi> will furnish you with a sufficient Institution in this Matter: No. The Scripture instructs us moreover in those Noble and


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93370:18"/>
Generous Vertues, which bring our Actions nearer to the Likeness of that diffusive and universal Goodness of God, by such a Peaceable and Submissive Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as makes the Wheels of Government go easie and whole Nations Happy.</p>
            <p>Secondly. But yet we must not be so Lifted up, even with the Best of our Actions, as to bring them in Competition with the Grace of God, or impute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny real Merit to them. Our Church, and the sound Writers of it Teach us, after we have done all we can, not to Value our own Righteousness, but that of Christ. And surely it would be a malapert Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in any of her Members, to Conceit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves so much Wiser than Seven Men that can ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Reason, as to Lower the Attributes of God's Righteousness, for the Exaltation of our own Merits; and grudge his Grace a free Passage through the Means of our Salvation. There are therefore Three Rocks especially to be Avoided in the Consideration of our Practical Duty.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. The First is that of <hi>Antinomianism</hi>; which casts off all Obligation to the Moral Law, and in the Teeth of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> abuses the Goodness of God in Derogation to his Holiness, by saying, <hi>Let us continue in sin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.1.</note> 
                  <hi>that grace may abound.</hi> And this we do not learn only from what is pass'd, but woful Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence teaches us every Day how much it has diffused it self through all our Sects, at least to some Degree; and they that pretend to be free from Sin, prove in effect to do it, that they may Sin the more freely.</item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:93370:19"/>II. There are that impose upon Practical Duty, and offer Indignity to the Divine Precepts. Some prefer their own Commandments before those of God; making it more Criminal to Disobey their own Laws than to break the Law of the Lord.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matt</hi> 15.19.</note> Thus did the <hi>Pharisees</hi> of Old, <hi>Teaching for doctrines the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men.</hi> And just so do the Papists now; while they generally impose a greater Penance upon the Breach of their Oanons, than upon a Sin directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Will of God.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.10.</note> But whereas the Law is Fulfill'd by Love, being made up of Peace, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleness and Concord: there is another sort of People who pervert the very Nature of it; and though not with so good a Heart as <hi>Moses,</hi> yet with as good a Will, break the Two Tables one against the other. Out of a pretended Zeal for one Duty they will Overthrow another, and expect that their Abhorring Idols will excuse their Sacrilege. But the Charac
ter of such Men is too obvious to deceive the Sincere; having been always found Unstable, Unquiet, Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous, Seditious, Insolent and Disobedient to Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, False and Treacherous to their Neighbours, full of all Hypocrisie, Clamorous for Justice and Religion, and having neither.</item>
               <item>III. Then there is the Proud <hi>Pelagian</hi>; who scorns to acknowledge his own Infirmities, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying Original Sin, chuses rather to impute the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy State he is in to Gods Workmanship than his own Folly. He Boasts out of Vanity, rather to be what he is not, by Establishing his own Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93370:19"/>
than submit to be a New Creature of God's Making.</item>
            </list>
            <p>These Desperate Diseases ye ought to Cure by your Moderation, and to continue earnestly to Preach up Good Works. For <hi>without holiness no man shall see the Lord</hi>: And tho it be the Holy Ghost that San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifieth, yet they must be Good Works, wrought by the Grace of God, that procure such Sanctification. So that ye are to urge to your People, the Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Pleasing God by Good Works; but at the same time that they do not depend upon them, to assure them, that their Labour shall not be in vain in the Lord; but that likewise they humbly Confess, that it is God alone that gives the Increase.</p>
            <p>Thirdly. It is of great Consequence, that ye press the Observation of the Two Sacraments, as well as their Power and Efficacy; they being so shamefully neglected and undervalued in these Days. For the generality of Religionaries lay them aside, out of a Contemptuous Conceit that they have no Worth in them; or at least not such as can add any thing to their Perfection. This was the Conceit of the <hi>Cathari,</hi> Condemned by the <hi>African</hi> Church; which probably was deriv'd from the <hi>Montanists,</hi> who might at least be some of those Animadverted upon by <hi>Origen</hi>;<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, §. 12.</note> and has been the certain Effect of Spiritual Pride, as well as of Prophaness in all Ages.</p>
            <p>But a truly humble Spirit will readily acknowledge, that the Wisdom of God is above all; and that what God has Consecrated by his Institution is to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93370:20"/>
with Reverence and Submission. A Man of just Sense and Reason will ask, what Familiarity or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication our Gross Beings here upon Earth should have with Spiritual Things, were there not some vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible <hi>Medium,</hi> in some manner to Qualifie and Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the Invisible Operations of God to our Weak Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings. I would have Men but to consider for what Reason Christ came in the Flesh,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17.</note> before they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Elementary part of the Sacraments, and so vainly despise an Outward and Visible Sign. <hi>Naaman</hi>'s Cure, if duly consider'd, is likewise a pregnant Instance.</p>
            <p>I shall Conclude with Two Cautions; which tho already touch'd upon, I do presume again to lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you: For I am perswaded, that the careful Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of them will contribute much to the Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of Peace and Truth in our Church.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In your Sermons and other Discourses, ye ought to treat Men of different Perswasions with that prudent Charity as not to expose the Truth, and with that Christian Prudence in asserting the Truth as not to forget Charity. For to Preach universal Safety to all that live Soberly and Vertuously, without observing the Defectiveness of our best Obedience, and the Means we are to lay hold on for the Reparation of our Breach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; is to encourage all the Wild Opinions of Hereticks and afford a great cover for Hypocrisie: because it puts so gross a Sleight upon the Articles of our Faith, as to render them in a manner Ridiculous; and by Cloak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Heresies with such a seemingly Meritorious Piety, puts a greater Value upon <hi>Crellius</hi>'s <hi>Ethicks</hi> than


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93370:20"/>
upon the Gospel. Therefore to affect such an unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Charity, does highly derogate from the Honour of God in our Redemption.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid. Praefat. Ioh. Fox contra Osori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um de Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatione, &amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22.</note> As then ye must not Judge your Brother in pronouncing Damnation upon his Person, that is peculiar to God; so ye must and ought to Damn his pernicious Errors, lest ye be found Partakers of his Sins. Should ye see a Poor Honest Man wandring in untrodden Paths, whether were it more Charity to tell him he may get to his Journey's end well enough the Way he is in; or to let him know the Danger he runs of being lost, if he comes not into the right Way? By the first Method ye please Men in Humouring them in the Error of their Ways, by the other ye uphold the Truth of God: by the one way ye run Men upon a Rock, by the other bring them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Safe Harbour. So that real Charity is to tell our Brother of his Mistakes, and not by Extenuation to flatter him into the hazard of his Ruin.</p>
            <p n="2">II. A careful Distinction should be observed in treating those that are in a wrong Way. If an Erring Brother be found Humble and of a Quiet Spirit, ye cannot be too Gentle towards such a one. For there must be a good Principle in him; however through Prejudice of Education, the Deceitfulness of Instructors or Weakness of Judgment he may be misled. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a Turbulent Spirit that seeks to propagate his Follies though at the Cost of breaking the Peace both of Church and State, deserves to be handled in a brisker manner, with a Style sharp enough to pierce the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness of his Temper. But whomever ye have to


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93370:21"/>
deal with in any Case of this Nature; Compassion ought to be the Ground of your whole Proceeding, that according to the Example of our Blessed Saviour, the end of all your Actions may be to do Good.</p>
            <p>Let me therefore again conjure each of you in the Name of God, and in the Words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy, Take heed unto thy self,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16.</note> 
               <hi>and unto thy doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt save thy self and them that hear thee.</hi> And that God who is pleased to suffer you to be encompassed with so many Difficulties, grant you Courage to Resist, and the Power of his Grace to Overcome so many Contradictions of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and make you Diligent to continue Faithful in your Ministry, through Jesus Christ our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>
