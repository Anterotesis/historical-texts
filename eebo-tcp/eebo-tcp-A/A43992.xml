            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT was not to convince the <hi>Atheists and Sadduces of
this Age,</hi> of the Existence of Spirits, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
of a Deity, that I began this Collection. They
have <hi>the Works of the Creation,</hi> both of the Great
and of the Lesser World, and <hi>an admirable Scene of
Providence</hi> exhibited to the rest of Man-kind in the
Posterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and Recorded in the Sacred
Writings, which, if they were disposed with well defeca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Minds (gently putting by the Leaves and the
Prickles, and the mean outside <hi>Covering,</hi> whereby they
are Veiled from the Prophane) to inspect the internal Form
and Composure, and deeply Contemplate the admirable
Accomodations of all the Parts, the Design and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
of the Whole, and the Secret Powers by which all is
Sustained and Ordered, they might (by the help of a
certain Divine Light, which doth often illustrate such
Souls so employed) discern a more Noble Evidence and
satisfactory Conviction of those things, which the <hi>Ignis
Fatuus</hi> of a vitiated Natural Vnderstanding (howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
improved, as is imagined, by the accomplishments
<pb facs="tcp:53434:3"/>
of what we commonly call Learning, but is in truth
but a superficial thing, in respect of true Knowledge)
cannot receive; and be assured, that <hi>Christianity</hi> is
indeed a Noble and Divine Philosophy, cast out like a
Ball, among the Children of Men, that they should
catch it that catch could; and accordingly is very
differently, and by most very unworthily entertained
in the World; not only by the sensual Swine, and by
the Muckworms, but by such as would be thought to be
of a more generous Strain, Cocks of the Game, and yet
prefer a Corn of Barly and a Feather, before an inesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
solid Jewel. But not only their Wills, which
are a great Byas upon the Judgment, but the Minds
and Consciences of most of these People are so Corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that they can not, or will not acquiesce in these
Matters, even in greater Evidence than what they free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
act upon in Matters more agreeable to their own
Genius and corrupt Affections, being as averse to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
their Vnderstanding to the Divine Wisdom, as their
Wills to the Laws and VVill of God, tho the Subjection
of the one is no less necessary to the attainment of the
great end of Man, accordingly designed in the Divine
Methods of Providence, than that of the other. And
therefore to have undertaken such a Work as this for the
Service of such People, I can hardly think would have
been to much purpose; and besides, it would have obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
me to such Proofs and Evidence for the satisfaction
of others, as I conceive not so absolutely necessary for my
<pb facs="tcp:53434:3"/>
purpose in many particulars; though I shall lay no
farther stress upon any of the Relations, when I come
to make use of them, than I am satisfied they may
reasonably bear. But <hi>my Design</hi> is this:</p>
            <p>Being well satisfied that <hi>much of the Good and
Evil,</hi> which occurs <hi>in the World,</hi> not only in relation
to particular Persons, but whole Families, Cities, and
Nations, which is commonly attributed to Humane
Management, or I know not what blind Fortune or
Chance, is in truth <hi>produced</hi> by the Secret prevalent
Energy and Operations of certain Invisible, Intelligent
Agents, which not only order and dispose divers Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
which to us Mortals seem very minute and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable,
to be Occasions of great Consequences, but
do also insensibly, and yet effectually bind and impede, or
excite and promote, the Actions of Men, to produce Events
some much short, some beyond, and some contrary, to their
Designs: And that <hi>our common Notion of Spirits,</hi>
that is, of those Invisible Agents, which I conceive to be of
very different Natures and Powers, are greatly and
unhappily mistaken: And lastly, that much of the
Evils, which afflict Mankind, are effected by Spirits of
an inferior Nature and Power, and but of the next
degree in knowledge and Power above us Mortals, and
such as are usually imployed by Witches and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians:
I suppose that a better Vnderstanding of the
Nature, Power, and Operations of these Spirits, of the
Means by which they get Advantage against us, and
<pb facs="tcp:53434:4"/>
of the Means whereby we may either prevent the same,
or be relieved and extricated out of their Power, would
be a matter of no little Vse and Benefit to Men. And
in order to this I have begun <hi>A Collection of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Relations of Matters of Fact concerning Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi>
but principally of <hi>Apparitions</hi> and <hi>Witches;</hi>
intending in Conclusion to put together <hi>my Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations</hi>
upon them, and what others I have met with
in print of this or former Ages, for this purpose.</p>
            <p>And because this Wicked, and, even in Things
wherein they think themselves Wise, Foolish Age,
have strangely imposed upon themselves, or been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
upon by the Efficacy of the Devil or his Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to a <hi>Disbelief</hi> of the being of Witches, or of
much of that Power, which they exercise through the
Instruction and Assistance of those Spirits, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
of their Agency in many Mischiefs and Evils,
which we ignorantly attribute to other Causes: And
also of some Means, which might be useful to detect
them, and to disappoint their Wicked Operations;
whereby many innocent and good People are left ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to their Malice, who might otherwise be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved;
I thought fit to begin with a Publication of
part of my <hi>Collection concerning Witches,</hi> reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
divers others which I have for a more Compleat
Information, and my Collection of Relations of Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions
till another time: And in the mean time shall
be very glad of any good Information or Assistance in
<pb facs="tcp:53434:4"/>
any thing relating thereunto; Wherein I desire only
<hi>Certainty</hi> as to Matter of Fact; and then how <hi>Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible</hi>
soever it may seem to the Vulgar, or such as
are skilled in the common Notions of Philosophy, I
care not: For I am well satisfied that divers great
Truths cannot but seem so to them.</p>
            <p>To this I thought it very proper to prefix <hi>a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi>
though not finished, of that no less Wise, Profound
Sagacious and Ingenuous, than Just and Good Man,
the late <hi>Lord Chief Justice HALE,</hi> concerning
the Mercy of God in preserving us from the Malice
and Power of Evil Angels; which he wrote at <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi>
the next Lord's day after the <hi>Tryal of</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Witches</hi> before him at <hi>St. Edmund's bury,</hi>
whom he there Condemned, and ordered to be Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
after a long Tryal from Seven or Eight in the
Morning till Seven or Eight at Night, wherein be
called to his assistance divers Physitians, and other
learned Men; and at last after a full and careful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination,
the Jury finding them Guilty, he passed
Sentence upon them with full Satisfaction of the Justice
of their Verdict. There is a Relation of it in print
written by his Marshal, which I suppose is very true,
though to the best of my Memory, not so compleat, as
to some observable Circumstances, as what he related
to me at his return from that Circuit. But that he
was well satisfied in it may be perceived by his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
this Meditation so immediately upon it. And
<pb facs="tcp:53434:5"/>
therefore I think it very proper for this place, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the use which well-disposed People may make of
it, but also as an Evidence of the Judgment, of so
Great, so Learned, so Profound and Sagatious, so Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
Circumspect and Tender a Man in matters of
Justice, and especially in matter of Life and Death,
upon so great Deliberation, (for he knew by his Kalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar
before-hand what a Cause he was to Try, and he
well knew the Notions and Sentiments of the Age)
and upon so solemn an Occasion; to check and correct
the Impiety, the Vanity, the Self-conceitedness, or Base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of such Witch-Advocates, as either confidently main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that there are no Witches at all, making their
shallow Conceptions an adequate measure for the extent
of the Powers of Nature, and of the Wisdom and Power
of God; or contrary to their Duty and their Oaths,
make light of the Examination and Tryal of them,
when brought before them. Such Persons may have
cause to be ashamed of themselves, after notice of such
a Judgment, and others may hereby be admonished what
to think of them, if they persist in such Assertions, or
Pretences.</p>

DISCOURSE
CONCERNING
The great Mercy of God, in preserving
us from the Power and Malice of Evil
Angels.</head>
            <head type="sub">Written by Sir Matt. Hale at Cambridge 26 Mar.
1661. Vpon occasion of a Tryal of certain Witches
before him the Week before at St. Edmund's-Bury.</head>
            <p>1. <hi>THat there are such evil Angels,</hi> it is without all
question: The <hi>Old Testament</hi> assures us of it,
as it easily appears upon the consideration of the
Temptation of our first Parents; the History of
<hi>Abimeleck</hi> and the Men of <hi>Shechem;</hi> the History of <hi>Saul</hi> and
the Witch of <hi>Endor;</hi> the History of <hi>Mica<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ah</hi> and the false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets;
the History of <hi>Job;</hi> the Prophecy of the Desolation
of <hi>Babylon,</hi> wherein <hi>Jim</hi> and <hi>Ziim</hi> and the <hi>Satyrs</hi> were
Prophesied to Inhabit: The <hi>New Testament</hi> more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly
and abundantly clears it, by the History of the
Temptation of our Lord; the <hi>Demoniacks</hi> of several Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
Cured by our Lord and his Apostles; the Procession of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53434:6"/>
the Evil Spirit, and his return with seven other Spirits; the
Vision of the Fall of <hi>Satan</hi> from Heaven like Lightning by
our Saviour; the several assertings of it in the Gospel and
Apostolical Epistles; the Prince of the power of the Air;
the Spirit ruling in the Children of Disobedience; the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Satan; Principalities and Powers in high Places, and
more frequently yet in the <hi>Apocalyps:</hi> It is also confirmed to
us by daily <hi>Experience</hi> of the Power and Energy of these
Evil Spirits in <hi>Witches,</hi> and by them.</p>
            <p>2. That these evil Spirits have likewise a great measure of
<hi>Power,</hi> and a greater measure of <hi>Malice,</hi> appears in the same
Scriptures and by Experience. The greatest Strength and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nergy
of any corporeal Creature, is in the vigourand power
of those Natural and Animal Spirits that are within them
The great swiftness and strength of the Lyon, the Wolf, the
Tyger, and of the strongest of Men, is the exerting of these
Vital and Animal Spirits, without which their Bodies, tho
of the exactest Model and Compages for strength, were but
a Trunk and <hi>iners moles.</hi> Certainly therefore those Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Spirits that are not clogged nor encumbred with Matter,
have a greater strength and energy, which is evident in those
Possessed <hi>Demoniacks</hi> both in the Gospel and in known Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
who could not be holden by the strength of Men,
when Possessed with this powerful and malignant Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>3. And yet <hi>their Malice</hi> to the Children of Men is more
extensive than their Power: It began with the First Man in
Innocence, and it hath improved ever since. The evidence
both of his Power and Malice, is mostlively seen in that display
of the Invisible Administration and Exercise of it towards <hi>Job;</hi>
that it contented not it self with any Bounds; his Goods,
his Children, his Name, his Body, the very Peace of his Soul
and Mind were not enough to content or quenoh it; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that had there not been a guard upon his Life his
Malice had also seized that: And which is yet more, his
Malice against the everlasting Soul of Man is unsatiable, as
appears in that express description of the Tempting of our
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53434:6"/>
Lord, Tempting him to Presumption; to Despair; to Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy
from God: And this he did not only out of a particular
or personal Malice against him; but as in his first Temptation
of the First <hi>Adam,</hi> his Malice was not only at him, but at
the whole Kind, which in a great measure he effected: so
in his Tempting of our Lord, he aimed not only Personally at
him, but in him at the <hi>totum genus Humanum:</hi> For tho pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
he might be ignorant of the hypostatical Union of the
Divine Nature to our Lord; yet doubtless he did suspect that
much of the good of Mankind was deposited in that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury,
which if he could have shattered and broken, he had
exquisitely satisfied the extent of his Malice against Mankind.</p>
            <p>4. This <hi>Malice and Power</hi> of that Evil one is much <hi>advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taged</hi>
in reference to Man. 1. By his great <hi>Experience and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty.</hi>
2. By his <hi>Invisibility and Swiftness,</hi> whereby he can
secretly and powerfully insinuate and mingle himself with
the Subject he means to mischief: He knows the Avenues
into Man; and he knows how most subtily and unsuspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
to seize upon them: In reference to <hi>the Body of Man,</hi> he
knows his Humours, his Temper, his Distemper, and hath
the advantage of the higher Ground, as <hi>Perseus</hi> had in his
fight with the Monster in the Fable; as the Eagle in his
fight with the Dragon: He can watch his Advantage and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discovered
can derive into him a malignant Air, or a poyso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Fume, or a venomous Infusion; His Experience in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Causes; his Ability to discover fit Actives, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
them effectually to Passives; his acquaintance with the
Natural Constitutions, and his opportunities to disturb, or
invenom it; his Speed and imperceptible Motion in insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of himself, and his Experiments upon the Body renders
it, upon a bare natural account, much subject to his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
            <p>5. And no less advantage hath he upon <hi>the Soul,</hi> First in
<hi>respect of it self</hi> and its own spiritual Nature, whereby in all
probability he can secretly and immediately insinuate himself
with it, and Perswade, and Excite, and Deceive, and Abuse,
as a subtil Man can deal with another of more simplicity:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53434:7"/>
For it seems altogether as reasonable upon a bare natural
account, that one Spirit may communicate with another in
a Kind proper to their Nature, as one Man may communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
to another, in a Kind suitable with his Nature. 2. And
principally <hi>in respect of the manner of the operation of the Soul
of Man in Communion with the Body,</hi> whereby she hath a kind
of dependance upon the Body's Constitution, and by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance
or disorder in that, become subject to a disorder
in her Actings: Upon this account he can disturb the Blood
into Cholar, or Lust; abuse the Fancy with false repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations
or disturbances in Truth; corrupt the Organ of
the Sense, or the Species which they receive; inrage, and
discompose the Humours of the Body, mingle Ingrediants
with them, that shall impede or corrupt the actings of
the Soul. And as thus he can corrupt within, so he can by
<hi>observation of the prevalence</hi> of any Lust or Passion, and of
the just <hi>and true season,</hi> when it is at the height, fit it with
a Temptation that shall draw it out to Action. When <hi>Achan</hi>'s
covetous humour is high, he can unvail the Wedge of
Gold and the Babylonish Garment. When <hi>David</hi>'s Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Idleness, and possibly high and delicate Fare, hath
raised up the Lust of his Flesh, he can present him with a
<hi>Bathsheba.</hi> Thus partly by <hi>his own</hi> Wisdom, Experience, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
Vigilancy, Invisibility, Strength and Power; partly
by our <hi>own</hi> Weakness and Infirmity, partly by <hi>the Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
he hath with our Tempers and Dispositions, he is able
to make advantage upon us, either by internal Corrupting,
or by external Alluring or Inciting us to what is hurtful and
prejudicial.</p>
            <p>6. Since therefore it is apparent that he wants neither
Power, nor Opportunity, nor Malice, to mischief us, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,
that certainly <hi>the obstruction of the executing of that
Power doth not arise from himself;</hi> for his Malice is unsatiable;
it is his business every day to go about seeking whom he may
Devour: And unquestionably his Malice would carry him
to the execution of the utmost of his Power, either to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
Mankind, or at least to make them Slaves to his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53434:7"/>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> who was most certainly the most Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
Prince in the World, could not be near so fond of
bringing the World under his Subjection, as this Prince of
Darkness is. Those that he cannot make his Vassals, he
would soon extirpate and exterminate out of the Bounds
of his affected Empire: And on the other side, the
obstruction is <hi>not from our selves;</hi> we are too weak
to deal with him; he was too hard for <hi>Adam</hi> in his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
and therefore must needs be too hard for us in our
corrupted Estate. And if it be said, there was but one to
one, we are many to one, or at least to few; we deceive our
selves herein, for <hi>they are Numerous:</hi> One Man was possessed
with a Legion, in the Gospel: But if it were otherwise, yet
the Agility and nimbleness of those impure Spirits is great,
and their dispatches speedy; they are <hi>Itinerarii &amp; Circumfera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nei,</hi>
walking to and fro through the World.</p>
            <p>7. It remains therefore, that the power and malice of this
great Enemy is checked and controlled, and <hi>limited by a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Power;</hi> it is <hi>Regnum sub graviori Regno:</hi> And he that hath
shut up the Sea in Bars and Doors, and said, <hi>Hitherto shalt
thou come, and no further, and here shall thy proud Waves stay,</hi>
hath likewise limited and confined this proud, and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and powerful Adversary within his Sphear and Limit,
and chained up this unruly and ravenous Woolf, so that he
cannot to one Link beyond his prefixed Bounds.</p>
            <p>8. These <hi>Bounds or limits of the Power and Activity of
this Adversary</hi> are many: we may reduce them into these
four, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The Law of their Subjection. 2. Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Dispensation. 3. Ministerial Resistance. 4. Natural
Impediments.</p>
            <p>I. The first restraint is <hi>the Law of their Subjection:</hi> for tho
those impure Spirits are like Rebels and Malefactors against
their Lord, and have an habitual Opposition against him,
yet they are under his Dominion; tho they hate to Obey him,
they dare not disobey him; tho they have not the love of the
Law of their Being, yet they are under the Cohersion and
fear of that Law. Just as there be among Men many vile
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53434:8"/>
People that yet dare not act their Villany for fear of Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and if they do, they do it by stealth and secretly: So
doubtless those Evil Angels are under a fear of Offending,
and do smart for it. Government is the Ordinance of God,
as well in the Invisible as the Visible World: And this seems
plain to me by that Petition of the evil Spirits to our Saviour,
that they might not be sent to the place of Torment, even
before their last and final Judgment. There are certain
Torments for their Extravagancies, inflicted by an Invisible
Oeconomy, which they fear and dread as much as Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors
do the Whip and the Pillory. And upon this account
partly it was, that <hi>Satan,</hi> tho he had naturally power to
have afflicted <hi>Job,</hi> durst not attempt it without leave and
permission from God.</p>
            <p>II. <hi>Providential Dispensation:</hi> And this is the same over
Men and Devils: It naturally lies in the Power of one Man
to Kill or Hurt another; yet that same Superintendency of
Divine Providence, without which a Sparrow falls not to the
Ground, prevents one Man from doing all the mischief to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that naturally lies in his Power; and the same preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Providential interposition, hinders the activity of
the Evil One from doing all that Mischief he naturally can
among the Children Men. And this was that Hedge and
Fence that God had made about <hi>Job,</hi> and all he had; and
till that were removed, the attempts of <hi>Satan</hi> were vain and
idle to have broken in upon him.</p>
            <p>III. <hi>Ministerial Impedimeuts,</hi> and these are of two kinds.</p>
            <p>1. Such Impediments as concern the Soul only, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Agency there. <hi>Satan</hi> he disturbs, and provokes, and
perswades and tempts to Evil, but the <hi>Divinae Graciae Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula</hi>
counter-perswade. The Son of God came into the World
to destroy the Works of the Devil, and there is a perpetual
contest between these two, for the Principality and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
over the Children of Men; on the one side, the Devil
and his Angels they Fight by their Method, and Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and Allurements, and Insinuations, to win over the
Children of Men to the Kingdom of Darkness: On the other
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53434:8"/>
side <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels, the Angels of the Covenant,
and the secret and powerful Agencies of his Grace and
assistance, take all opportunities to reduce Men to the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of God, to their Duty to him, confirms them in it,
detects and discovers, and convinceth the Tempter, and
upholds the Spirits of Men against him: He will convince
the World of Judgment by judging the Prince of this World,
that is, by detecting his Sophistry, his Falsity, and the ill
consequences thereof.</p>
            <p>2. Such as concern the inward Man and the outward
Man also, the Ministration of the <hi>Good Angels,</hi> who are as
diligent to counter-work the Evil Angels in their Mischiefs,
as they can be sedulous to inflict them; they are Ministering
Spirits. When the Devil was using a slight to gain the Body
of <hi>Moses</hi> to make an Idol of him, <hi>Michael</hi> resisted him.
The Evil Angels are full of Power and full of Malice against
the Children of Men; and on the other side, the good Angels
are no whit inferior to them in Power, and are Benevolent
and Loving to the Children of Men, and do many and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times when we know it not, prevent us from many mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
that these malevolent Regiments of Hell would inflict
upon our Bodies and our Souls. And doubtless, as we see
in the visible Administration of the World, or of any one
Kingdom thereof, there is continual Diligence on one side by
seditious turbulent minded Men to break the Peace of a
Kingdom or City, or place, which is with much diligence,
watchfulness, and vigilancy, attended and prevented by wise
and good Men; so there is no less care and vigilancy, and
counterworking by the Pure and Good Angels, against the
mischievous designs of these evil Spirits against the Children
of Men.</p>
            <p>IV. <hi>Natural Impediments</hi> to the working of that Evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>In reference to the Soul</hi> and inward Man. God hath
fortified the Will of Man with the priviledge of Liberty;
tho those Evil Angels may sollicit, perswade and tempt, yet
Almighty God hath placed this Bar in his way, <hi>viz.</hi> The
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53434:9"/>
freedom of the Will, that all the Devils in Hell cannot take
from him: It is an impregnable Fort, that can only be
taken by Dedition, but never by Storm or Assault. And this
is partly the reason of that Text, <hi>Resist the Devil and he will
flie from you.</hi> He knows that where there is Resistance of
the Will, there is no entrance for him, and gives over the
Assault.</p>
            <p>2. In reference <hi>to the Body</hi> or outward Man. He cannot
ordinarily exercise any Violence upon the outward Man, but
by the Mediation of things Corporeal, and most ordinarily by
the mediation of Mankind: He cannot kill a Man but by the
Sword of a Man-slayer; nor rob or plunder, but by a <hi>Caldean</hi>
or <hi>Sabean;</hi> nor infect the Body, but by the means of a Witch.
And all this God hath most wisely ordered in this manner,
that tho the Impure Spirit it self be out of the reach or
regiment of Human Justice or Government; yet the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
without which he cannot ordinarily work, is within
the reach of Human Justice or Government: whereby the
wise and good God hath consequently as it were, reduced
him, <hi>viz.</hi> in his Instruments, without which he cannot act,
under the very Power of Human Laws and Government. I
say, ordinarily he cannot act any external mischief upon
Man, but by such Means and Instruments as are under the
cohersion of Human Laws. I say, <hi>Ordinarily,</hi> for when this
<hi>Irae Divinae satelles</hi> is Commissioned from the God of Heaven,
he may act immediately from himself, according to the tenor
or extent of his Commission; but Ordinarily and Naturally he
cannot.</p>

            <head>Doctor Pordage his Relation of the wonderful Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Visions, and unusual things which were seen
in his Family, in the Year, 1649.</head>
            <p>DOctor <hi>John Pordage</hi> Rector of <hi>Bradfield</hi> in the County
of <hi>Berks,</hi> being the Eighteenth of <hi>September</hi> 1654,
Charged with certain Articles then and afterward exhibited
to the Commissioners for ejecting of Scandalous Ministers; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
other things, for entertaining at his House one
<hi>Everard</hi> a reputed Conjurer; and that he had frequent and
familiar Converse with Angels; and concerning the Vision
of a Dragon, and Apparitions of Spirits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
of <hi>Everard,</hi> he answered and confessed, that
about four Years before, he was received into his House for
about three Weeks and no longer, but not as a Conjurer,
but as a workman at Harvest; and that he never heard the
least intimation that he was ever suspected to be a Conjurer,
till after his Departure, but afterward was strongly enclined
to believe that he was: And concerning the Vision of a
Dragon, and Apparition of Spirits, <hi>I will not confess,</hi> saith he,
<hi>any Apparition in particular,</hi> till they be proved, lest I should
seem to accuse my self, they being brought in as a Crime
against me, and as Instruments to Condemn me: Yet, in
general I acknowledge, that some four Years since, there
were many strange and wonderful Apparitions in my House:
But, what can these in Justice amount to, tho attested by
Oath, and confessed particularly by my self, when brought
before those who profess themselves Christians, and are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the History of the Holy Scriptures? Pray,
was not <hi>Job</hi> a pious, sincere, and eminently Righteous Man?
Yet, how was he scared with Dreams, and terrified with
Visions, <hi>Job</hi> 7. 14. Did not <hi>Zachariah</hi> the Prophet, Chap. 3.
see <hi>Satan</hi> standing at the right hand of <hi>Josua</hi> to resist him?
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53434:10"/>
Did not <hi>John (Rev. 12.)</hi> in a Vision behold a great red
Dragon that made War with <hi>Michael</hi> and the Holy Angels?
And was not Christ himself tempted of the Devil, by Voice
and Vision? <hi>Matt.</hi> 4. 6, 8. Now, <hi>the Servant is not greater
than his Lord,</hi> Jo. 15. 20. and therefore not exempted from
the like attempts of the Devil. I beseech you consider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this Earth be not the Place where the Devil walks up
and down seeking whom he may Devour? How then can
<hi>Bradfield,</hi> or any other Place, be exempted from his Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
when God permits? And may not all this be for the
manifesting of his Glory, Goodness and Power? And who
can tell whose Family may be next exposed by God's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
to be tryed and proved by the Representation of
<hi>Satan?</hi> And I desire you seriously to consider how any such
Apparitions raised by the Devil, and permitted by God for
his own Glory, argue me either Ignorant, Scandalous, or
Insufficient: Surely it rather argues that he hath blest me
with a strong Faith, in that he permitted such great Tryals,
and made me instrumental to overcome them by Prayer
and Fasting. If it can be proved I ever so much as looked
toward the unlawful Art of <hi>Black Magick,</hi> or that any Evil
Spirits were raised up by any compact of mine, explicit, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit;
or that those Evil Apparitions were subdued and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
by any other means than by God's Blessing upon our
Fasting and Prayer, I shall judge my self worthy of Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But otherwise, it is hard measure to be Prosecuted
for the Malice of the Devil toward me, inflicting what I was
Passive in, and could not help, especially by those who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
the Christian Religion, and know that the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
ruleth over all, permitting and disposing whatever comes
to pass.</p>
            <p>This is the sum of what I meet with in his answer to the
Commissioners concerning this part of his Charge: But in
an Apology afterward, he inserted a particular Relation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Visions and Apparitions therein alledged against
him, as here followeth in his own words.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:53434:10"/>
I Do judge that God doth call me forth to make a free and
open Discovery of those <hi>Wonderful Apparitions, Visions
and unusual things,</hi> which somewhat above four Years since
<hi>were seen</hi> and permitted by the Lord to be <hi>in my Family.</hi> And
if all that read this, can but receive and judge of it by that
Rule and Principle from which I write it, they will be so
far from judging me, as that they cannot but bless God
for his Favour and Mercy to me; and the more admire his
wonderful Works and the greatness of his Power.</p>
            <p>What I intend here to declare, I shall dispatch in these
<hi>three Particulars.</hi> 1. In relating what I have acknowledged
to many Persons I have Discoursed with. 2. Many conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
things, which I have never Discoursed but to some
Friends. 3. The good effect of this upon my self and others
of my Family.</p>
            <p>1. I confess, That in <hi>August</hi> 1649. there appeared in my
Bedchamber about the middle of the Night, <hi>a Spirit in the
shape of</hi> Everard, with his wearing Apparel, Band, Cuffs,
Hat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Who after the sudden drawing of the Bed-Curtain,
seemed to walk once through the Chamber very easily, and
so Disappeared.</p>
            <p>That very Night there was another Appearance of one
in the form of <hi>a Gyant,</hi> with a great Sword in his Hand
without a Scabbard, which he seemed to flourish against me,
having the figurative similitude of a green Tree lying by
him.</p>
            <p>After this had continued for the space of half an Hour, it
Vanished; and there succeeded a third Appearance, which
was very Terrible, being in the shape of <hi>a great Dragon,</hi>
which seemed to take up most part of a large Room, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
with great Teeth and open Jaws, whence he
often ejected Fire against me, which came with such a
Magical Influence, that it almost struck the Breath out of
my Body, making me fall to the Ground.</p>
            <p>Now, you must know, that these three were dreadful
Apparitions, and very terrible to the sensitive Nature, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53434:11"/>
might have caused a great Distemper in it, had I not been
supported in an extraordinary way by the Ministration of
the Holy Angels against the evil effects of those extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
unusual Apparitions, the last of which continued till
the day began to dawn, and then Disappeared.</p>
            <p>2. In the Second place I shall proceed to declare those
extraordinary things which few have been yet acquainted
with, which yet were then seen and experimented amongst
us. I say then there were <hi>two Invisible, Internal Principles
opened and discovered</hi> to us, which may be called <hi>Mundi Idae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ales,</hi>
being two Spiritual Worlds, extending and penetrating
throughout this whole visible Creation, in which many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
things were discerned suitable to the Nature of those
Worlds. Now, those two Principles or Worlds, seemed
very much different one from another, as having contrary
Qualities and Operations, by which <hi>they work upon this visible
Creation,</hi> which we see distinguished and differenced into
variety of Creatures, some Poysonful and Noxious, others
Wholsom and Harmless, according to the difference and
contrariety of things in the Internal World, upon which the
External doth in some measure depend, as standing in them,
or rather proceeding from them. Now, these could not have
been seen, had not that <hi>inward Spiritual Eye,</hi> which hath
been locked up and shut by the Fall, been opened in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
way in us. Besides, we had our <hi>other Internal
Spiritual Faculties</hi> of Spiritual sensation opened to discern
their <hi>various Objects</hi> within those Worlds: Which Objects
by reason of their Qualities, may be differenced into Good
and Evil.</p>
            <p>But I shall here first present the Objects of that Internal
World, which may be called <hi>Mundus Tenebrosus,</hi> or the Dark
World. Which Objects by our correspondent inward Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
or Senses were then discerned and made known to us.</p>
            <p>First then, as to the Objects of the internal <hi>Sight,</hi> when
this Principle or World was Opened, we beheld innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
multitudes of Evil Spirits, or Angels, presenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in appearing Distinctions of Order and Dignity, as
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53434:11"/>
Powers, Principalities, Dignities. My <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> meaning is, there
seemed to be Inferiority and Superiority; Governors and
Governed; <hi>the Princes</hi> of this dark World and their Subjects,
which presented themselves as passing before our Eyes <hi>in
State and Pomp,</hi> all the mighty ones appearing to be drawn
in dark Airy Clouds, Chariots with six, or at least four
Beasts to every one; besides, every figured similitude of a
Coach, was attended with many <hi>inferior Spirits,</hi> as Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
to the Princes. But concerning <hi>the Shapes and Figures</hi>
of the Spirits, you must know they were very Monstrous, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible,
and Affrighting unto the outward Man. Those that
drew the cloudy Coaches appearing in the shapes of Lions,
Dragons, Elephants, Tygers, Bears, and such like Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Beasts. Besides, the Princes and those that attended
them, tho all in the shapes of Men, yet represented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
monstrously mishapen, as with Ears like those of Cats,
cloven Feet, ugly Legs and Bodies, Eyes fiery, sharp and
piercing. Now, besides these Appearances within, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
made some wonderful <hi>Impressions upon visible Bodies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,</hi>
as Figures of Men and Beasts upon the Glass Windows
and the Cealings of the House, some of which yet remain.
But what was most remarkable was the whole visible World
represented by the Spirits upon the Bricks of a Chimney, in
the from of two half Globes, as in the Maps. After which,
upon other Bricks of the same Chimney, was Figured a
Coach and four Horses, with Persons in it, and a Footman
attending, all seeming to be in Motion, with many other
such Images, which were wonderful exactly done. Now,
fearing lest there might be any Danger in these Images,
through unknown Conjuration and false Magick, we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to wash them out with wet Cloaths, but could
not, finding them Ingraven in the substance of the Bricks,
which indeed might have contiued till this day, had not
our fear and suspicion of Witch-craft, and some evil design
of the Devil against us in it, caused us to deface and obli<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate
them with Hammers. Now, what the Devil's End in
the former Apparitions, and those figurative Representations
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53434:12"/>
was, the Lord knows: But it was certainly Evil; Even as
it was <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> against Christ, when he shewed him (in Vision)
the Kingdoms and Glory of the World, to make him fall
down and Worship him. But God's end in permitting it
was very good, even to bring us nearer to himself, in a
stronger dependance upon his Eternal Power, and to make
us more watchful against the Subtilty and Power of <hi>Satan,</hi>
as you will see afterwards, when I come to speak of the Effects
of those things in reference to our Selves. But to shut up
this Relation of the Objects we saw in this Dark World, I
must add this, that were but the Eyes of Men opened to see
<hi>the Kingdom of the Dragon</hi> in this World, with the multitudes
of Evil Angels, which are every where tempting and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snaring
Men, they would be amused, and not dare to be by
themselves without good Consciences, and a great assurance
of the love and favour of God, in protecting them by the
Ministration of the holy Angels.</p>
            <p>2. As to the Objects of the outward <hi>Smell,</hi> I must let you
know, that within the three Weeks space in which these Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
appeared, at several times the Evil Spirits and Angels
did raise up such noysom poysonous Smells, that both the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and outward part of those that were exercised with
them, became much disturbed and offended: For through
the sympathy betwixt the Body and the Soul, the sulphurous
hellish Smells much exercised both by Magical Tinctura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>3. In reference to the Objects of <hi>Tast,</hi> You must know,
that sometimes both in the day and night, we were exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
with the loathsom hellish tasts of Sulphur, Brimstone,
Soot and Salt mingled together. Which were so loathsom
to our Natures, as that they were ready to cause great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers
and Nauseousness in our Bodies; but the Invisible
Power of <hi>Jehovah</hi> supported us beyond our own Strength.</p>
            <p>4. In relation to our inward and outward <hi>Touch,</hi> we were
much exercised both in Body and Soul. As to our Souls,
we sometimes felt such strange Magical Wounds and Prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
by the fiery Darts of the Devil, that none can express,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53434:12"/>
but those that have been exercised in some measure, as <hi>Job</hi>
was, who felt the Poyson of those invenomed Arrows, which
came upon him by the permission of the Almighty; which
like the Scorpions in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> sting and pierce those
they touch. As to our Bodies, we found material Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
from the Powers of Darkness, very noxious in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to our natural Spirits and Life, but cheerfully born
by Invisible support, and quiet submission unto the Will of
God.</p>
            <p>But to conclude: By these wonderful and strange Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises,
we could not but have strong apprehensions and lively
resemblances of the Torments and Miseries of Hell, where
Sulphur, Fire, Brimstone, poysonous Smells, Darkness, mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
horrid Shapes and Sights are the entertainment of the
imprisoned Spirits.</p>
            <p>But, now I come to the other Internal World, which we
may term <hi>Mundus Luminosus,</hi> or the Light World, which
with its various Objects was then likewise opened to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Senses.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First</hi> then I shall here set forth the Objects of the inward
Eye, which were then seen by us. There appeared then
to our inward Sight, multitudes, almost innumerable, of
<hi>pure Angelical Spirits,</hi> in figurative Bodies, which were clear
as the Morning-Star, and transparent as Christal. These
were <hi>Mahanaim,</hi> or the Lord's Host, appearing all in manly
Forms, sending forth a Tincture like the swift Rays of the
hot Beams of the Sun, which we powerfully felt to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing
of our Souls, and enlivening of our Bodies.</p>
            <p>Now, beholding the multiplicity, variety and beauty
of these Spirits, with the various Objects and Wonders of
this World, Cloathed in the purest Tincture of Light and
Colour, we could not but bless the God of Heaven, who by
the Eyes of Wisdom and Hand of Power, brought forth such
Glorious Creatures, and now shewed them in their several
Beauties to us in a time of Tryal and Temptation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:53434:13"/>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> In relation to our inward sense of <hi>Hearing,</hi> there
were many <hi>musical Sounds and Voices,</hi> like those which <hi>John</hi>
heard upon Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> then heard by us; the sweetness,
harmony and pleasantness of which cannot be expressed, nor
that Spiritual Joy and Delight which by them was infused
into our Souls, uttered by the Tongue, being ready to ravish
our Spirits into the highest Praises of the Eternal <hi>Jehovah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> In relation to the Faculty of <hi>Smelling,</hi> the Tongue
can hardly express those <hi>Odours</hi> of Paradise and heavenly
<hi>Perfumes</hi> which then were smelt, piercing into the very Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
with a cherishing Tincture; besides that quickning Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
which by them was communicated and insinuated into
the Spirits of our outward Bodies, which like a Cordial, had
been able to have renewed the strength of our languishing
Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly.</hi> Our Sense or Faculty of <hi>Tasting</hi> was very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly
entertained with those invisible Dews, which were
sweeter than Hony, or the Hony-comb, and therefore deserve
to be called the Dews of Heaven; with which instead of
Food, we were many times wonderfully Refreshed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly.</hi> In relation to the Sense of <hi>spiritual Contaction,</hi>
that was also delighted with its heavenly Objects: For none
can utter that pleasing Impression, which the burning Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of this Light World afforded us, coming like a hot
Cordial into the centre of our Spirit, being sensibly felt in the
inward Parts, so as to cause much joy and heavenly Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
which penetrated through our Souls, giving us occasion
to bless, praise and magnifie the Lord.</p>
            <p>Thus for the space of three Weeks or a Month were we
exercised inwardly and outwardly, through that great
Conflict which was betwixt those two Worlds and their
Inhabitants: The Dark World sometimes afflicting us with
dreadful Shapes, abominable Smells, loathsom Tasts, with
other Operations of the Evil Angels: The Light World at
other times opening and relieving us with odoriferous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes,
most sweet Dews, glorious Visions, and Angelical
Harmony, which the Lord favoured us with, to shew his
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53434:13"/>
extraordinary Love in this Succouring us in extraordinary
Exercises and Tryals.</p>
            <p>Thus much for those two internal Worlds, spread through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the visible World; in which the Evil and good Angels
are more immediately than in this visible Air, to which
they cannot be commensurate by reason of their spiritual
Natures, each of them abiding in their distinct Principle, the
the one sort being in Joy, the other being in Torment, the
one in Light, the other in Darkness, according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Besides these two Worlds, we had an opening of the
<hi>Eternal World,</hi> called in Scripture the World to come, (or
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Heb. 2. 5.)</hi> from the futurity of its full and
clear manifestation, and a precursory entrance into the most
Holy Place, by a Divine Transportation into the Glory of
the Majesty, agreeable to that of St. <hi>John, 17. 24. Father, I will
that they also whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am, that
they may behold my Glory which thou hast given me, &amp;c.</hi> Here
were seen, heard and felt unutterable Mysteries of that
Kingdom, which are not yet to be divulged, in regard of
the Pride, Ignorance, Prejudice and Envy of many in the
World, being reserved for those humble gracious Spirits,
which are waiting in Silence for the second coming of the
Son of Man.</p>
            <p>But, now it is time to come to the <hi>third Particular,</hi> which
was <hi>the effects and Impressions</hi> left upon our Spirits by these
wonderful Exercises and Manifestations.</p>
            <p>After this, we began more clearly to see that <hi>Strait and
Narrow Way</hi> which leads to Life Eternal, which we call <hi>the
Virgin Life,</hi> or the Life of Purity and Righteousness in its
Perfection, being the Life of fixed Love: In any thing short of
which, the perfection of Virgin Life cannot consist. So that
meerly to abstain from the concupiscible lustings of <hi>Venus</hi> under
the Spirit of this great World, is but the Life of outward
Chastity, and but a particular Branch of the other. <q>For the
Virgin Life is not attained till the Will of the Soul is
brought through Death to be so Passive, as to will, desire
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53434:14"/>
and act nothing but what the essential Essence of Love
wills, moves and acts through it: For till then the Soul
cannot be a pure Virgin, nor live without all Desire and
Imagination; which must all cease before the pure Life of
God can come to be all in all.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Life of Virginity was placed fore-right as to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Eye of the Mind, being that mark of Persecution, at
which we are to aim in our pressing toward the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Dead. To this Wisdom, that Eternal Virgin <hi>(Prov.
8. 20, 23.)</hi> as a Leading-Star invited us, calling to follow
her in the way of Circumcision, Resignation and the Cross,
in the way of total Self-denial, and forsaking of all for her
sake, in the way of Annihilation and conformity to Christ's
Death, by which we saw undoubtedly we should come to
Christ's Resurrection, Ascention, Glorification, and Fixation
in the love of the Holy Ghost, the third and last Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Here we clearly saw the danger of looking back to the
External World, and of putting out our Imagination into
the Inward World, or the Kingdom of the Dragon; or
of resting in the openings and delights of the Inward Light
World. For by turning back into the delights of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
we saw the Soul would become Bastial; by turning to
the left Hand and imagining into the Kingdom of the Dragon,
in awakening the fire of Wrath and Subtilty, devilishly and
dangerously Wicked; by turning to the right Hand in ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
into, and taking too much complacency in the Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Illuminations, Tinctures and Enthusiasms of the Light
World, we saw the Soul might become elevated into self-conceit,
and tinctured with Pride, and be in danger of neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
the Death of the Cross, which is the only safe Path
into eternal Rest and Fixation.</p>
            <p>Here then we were shewed, that the way which leads
up to the Virgin Essence the New <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> was strait and
narrow, as upon the Breadth of an Hair, so that we were to
turn no way either on the right or left Hands, but
stand without Lusts, with our Eyes fixed upon the Being of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53434:14"/>
Love, pressing forwards after Fixation in the Eternal House of
God, there to become immoveable Pillars, no more to go
out, but there always to bear the Name of God, and the
Name of the City of God, which is <hi>New Jerusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now for the space of this four Years, ever since the
time of these great Manifestations, we, by the Grace of God,
have enjoyed the exercises of our Spiritual Senses, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
since have been shut, neither ever will be, except through
voluntary Transgression and Disobedience, we Apostatize
and run back into the Earthly Nature, or turn aside to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in something short of the pure Life of Virginity, which
calls us from the External, through the Internal, into the
Eternal World; which is that Kindom prepared for us from
the beginning of the World.</p>
            <p>But Thirdly, after this extraordinary time of Grace and
Mercy to us, we enjoyed not only a clear leading convicting
Light upon our Understandings, but likewise received from
the Lord a stamp and strong impression of Power, moving our
Wills to follow this Light through the Death of all things,
to come up into the perfect Life and Image of God, that so
we might be transformed into that Righteous Nature, which
we so clearly behold through Divine Light. Hence we came
to live in a greater abstraction from our Sensitive Nature,
in a constant watchful practice of the Cross, in reference to
all external and internal Objects, which might by entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Affections, hinder our progress to God. Hence also
we came to live a more devoted, strict, dedicated Life, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questring
our selves from the World and worldly things,
giving our selves almost continually to Prayer, Fasting and
waiting upon God, in dying daily to all self-Ownments, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
and Proprieties, in which most are intangled, to the
great prejudice of their Spirits. And in this way we have
ever since continued, endeavouring to be wholly conformable
to the Death of Christ; in renouncing our own Lives and
proper Wills, as opposite to the Life and Will of God, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimenting
those profound Mysteries of the Cross of Christ,
which are hidden to most in the World. But what Joy,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53434:15"/>
Life, Power, divine Pleasure, and Heavenly Communion,
the Lord hath blessed us with in this our dying resigning
Progress, I shall wrap up in Silence, together with those bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Secrets of the Kingdom, which in these few last Years
past we have been acquainted with, to the comfort of our
Spirits in this sad time, when we are judged and condemned
of the World, in the participations of Christ's Sufferings.</p>

            <head>The Discovery of Thirty and Two young Girls in
the Cloister of Madam Bourignon at Lisle, found
to be Witches. Related by her self and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuator
of her Life.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>ANthoinette Bourignon</hi> was Born at <hi>Lisle</hi> in <hi>Flanders 13
January,</hi> 1616. Her first appearance in the World was
not without some Deformity, her Forehead being grown all over
with black Hairs, her upper Lip drawn up to her Nose, and her
Mouth gaping wide open: But the hairs of her Fore-head after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
fell off of themselves, and her Lip was restored to its proper
Posture by the help of a Chirurgeon, and she grew more and more
Comely; yet her Mother had never any great Affection to her, but
loved her least of all her Children; but her Father loved her
best of all, possibly the better for being of his own Complexion,
he being an <hi>Italian,</hi> whereas all the rest who were Fair, possibly
took after their Mother, who was of the Country of <hi>Lisle.</hi> She
was it seems from her Child-hood to be conformable to her
Saviour in Sufferings: And her first Persecutions were by her own
Kindred and nearest Relations, even her Mother and her Sister,
which had this happy effect upon her, that she became very Retired
and Serious in her tender Age. And she then received such strong
impressions and attractions by the Grace of God, as soon as she
had the use of Reason, that her Thoughts and Discourses were
such as seemed not to come from a Child, but from one of well
grown in Years. She always thought she should be in some other
Place, and enquiring where was the Country where Christians In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit,
expressed a desire to go thither. And when she was told
she was then in a Country of Christians, she could not believe it,
because <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> was born in a Stable, and lived in Poverty;
but the People there had stately Houses, rich Furniture and
plenty of Mony, &amp;c. But such Discourse would not down there,
but was turn'd into Ridicule, so that she was constrained to keep
silence and say no more of it. When she grew up, she would not
Marry, but had a mind to enter into Religion, or become a Nun
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53434:16"/>
among the <hi>Carmelites,</hi> where she hoped to find such true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
as she desired; but therein soon found her self mistaken; and
thereupon betook her self to a Solitary and Retired Life, with
great Austerities, exercising various acts of Charity as she saw
occasion.</p>
            <p>After the Decease of her Father in <hi>April</hi> 1648, her Mother,
Brother, and all her Sisters being Dead before, having recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
what belong'd to her from her Mother-in-Law, she at first
intended to have gotten together a Society of Religious Virgins:
But one day as she was walking there met her a Stranger, whom
she did not remember to have ever seen before, and told her, that
what she purposed, she could not effect, nor would it be to any good
purpose, for there were Nunneries enough; but there were great store
of poor Children every where, who wanted good Education; and
there could be no better Work thought on, than to take some of
them, and Educate them from their Childhood in Religion and
Virtue, and such Employments as might enable them to get a
comfortable livelyhood. This Man went by the name of <hi>Jean de
St. Saulieu,</hi> and proved at last a very Wicked Man: But in the
mean time prevailed with her to undertake this Work; and the
rather because one <hi>Jean Stappart</hi> a Merchant, had already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
a House at <hi>Lisle,</hi> with near 50l. <hi>per an.</hi> for that very
purpose, and had already taken in about a Dozen poor Girls. With
him she contracted in the Year, 1653, and had their Agreement set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
by Publick Notaries: And in <hi>November</hi> that Year, she made
her Entrance into the House, and soon had the number of her Girls
encreased to about 50. She kept them at first only as in an Hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
or School; but finding some inconveniencies in that way, she
thought fit to be recluse; and in <hi>November</hi> 1658, by permission
of the Bishop, turn'd it into a Cloyster, where she kept her Girls
under strict Discipline, and to very good Orders, both as to their
Work and as to matters of Religion: But after she had passed about
Seven years in these pious Exercises, three Years after she was
Cloystered up, no less than <hi>Two and thirty</hi> of these young Girls
were discovered to be Witches. Of which, and of divers remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Particulars thereunto appertaining, the three following Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
furnish us with a considerable History.</p>

La Parole de Dieu.</head>
            <p>113. AFter my being Encloistered, I had more leisure
and convenience to attend daily the Instruction of
the Children. I discovered more of their Wickedness, and
pressed them the more to good Living: But I perceived
their Souls but little the better, unles Exteriorly. They
were more Modest and Obedient, keeping to the Rules of
Prayers Enjoyned them. People that saw and heard them
Pray and Sing, thought them little Angels: But I was always
of the mind that they were without the Grace of God; but
yet I know not by what means. Some of them came of
themselves to Confession every Week, tho it was customary
but once a Month. They willingly heard good Lectures,
Fasted the whole <hi>Lent,</hi> though they were not obliged to it.
Made their Humiliations every <hi>Friday,</hi> by telling their Faults
in the Hall. Underwent without regret all the Penances
which were enjoyned them. There was nothing of ill ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in their Comportment, but that some of them would
not work willingly. Others were enclinable to Lying and
to Thieving, for which they were Corrected, and many
times with profit and amendment. I put all those out of
the House who were not content with a Christian Life. The
rest declared themselves to be more contented than they were
before. I would no more take so great a Number again,
well perceiving that there would be less Confusion in it. I
Prayed to God to know of him whether he received Glory
by it. He answered me, these are but <hi>Humane Accomodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>114. This I have very much experienced since, seeing that
neither the Children nor their Parents sought more than their
Temporal Advantage; as poor People for the most part
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53434:17"/>
are little sollicitous for the Glory of God, or the Salvation
of their Souls, so that their Bodies are at Ease. This often trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
me: But afterwards considering that their Souls were
Cultivated as well as their Bodies, I went on in my upright
Intention, to gain them to God. My Confessor very much
approved of this Exercise; but often asked me whether I
would not accomplish my first Designe. I answered, Yes,
but that God must shew me the Way and the Place appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and that his time was not yet come. Many Persons
grew to have a kindness for the House, and added divers
foundations to it. We had the Mass every day; a great
concourse of People came to us. Upon St. <hi>Anthony</hi>'s day
we had a Plenary Indulgence, and the three Pastors cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
High Mass, and other Divine Services with us.</p>
            <p>115. One day as I came into the School where all the
Children were at Work, I saw a great number of <hi>little black
Children with Wings</hi> fly about their Heads. I told them my
Vision, exhorting them to beware of the Devil, who most
certainly environed them.</p>
            <p>116. After I had passed about Seven Years in these pious
Exercises, it happened one day that as <hi>one of these Girls</hi> was
to have been Corrected for sorne fault, we <hi>shut her up into a
place call'd the Prison.</hi> About an Hour after she was there, she
came out tho no Body opened her the Door. And as all the
other saw her come into the School, they changed their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
and looked Pale. Returning, I saw it was she who
had been Lock'd up. She asked me Forgiveness, promising
me to Amend. I asked her who it was who opened her the
Door? She said a Man. I told her she was Mad; because no
Man came into the Cloister, and bid her take her Work.
She who had shut her up, was then Abroad: And when she
returned and saw this Girl at Work, she was amazed, and
said, Who has opened the Door for her? I carried the Key
with me. I made her go to the Place where she had shut
her up, where she found the two Doors Lock'd as she left
them when she went out. I took the Child a part into my
Chamber to Examin her. She said that a Man who was her
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53434:17"/>
Friend, came and opened the Door for her, and she call'd him
always in her need. I was afraid that this must be the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.
I sent the Pastors word that they should come and hear
the Matter, who having strictly examined her, told me,
that there was great appearance that she was a Witch. I
would not believe them. Nevertheless I immediately turn'd
<hi>her out of the House,</hi> fearing that some Evil Spirit had brought
her thither, and that she might trouble the House. She was
between Thirteen and Fourteen years of Age. I now called
to mind, that the whole Fury of Hell was to be armed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
me: Wherefore I pray'd that strength might be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
me to Oppose and conquer them.</p>
            <p>117. About three Months after, it happen'd that another
Girl was to be shut up, of about Fifteen Years Old. She
said, that the Devil made her to commit the Thievery;
and that he came to her by Night. I turn'd her out also,
thinking to purge the House. But yet three Months after we
discover'd <hi>another</hi> who was but Thirteen Years Old. She
was to have been Whip'd: But saith she, Do not do it, and
I'll tell you who it is that makes me do this Mischief. Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
her aside into my Chamber, she told me that it was the
Devil. I asked her whether she knew the Devil or not?
She said ay, he is almost always with me. I asked her what
manner of Person he was? She said he was a handsom young
Youth a little bigger than her self; that he had marked her
upon her Head; and that she had given him her Soul, and
had renounced God and her Baptism. I forbid her to tell
this to any Body. However I sent for the Pastors being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much troubled to think what this should be, believing
it an Illusion, or a Frenzy.</p>
            <p>118. When the Pastors had Examin'd her, they said, that
I ought not to put her away, for that there was a great
Misfortune among these Children, which was to be search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the bottom; for that this Girl had declared to them,
that there were <hi>two more</hi> among them such as her self. They
Examined those two, who declared that they were so, and
that there were <hi>two more</hi> besides. We Examined on further,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53434:18"/>
and found that all the said Girls were in Compact with the
Devil: For they related such particulars which they could not
know unless they were true, or else they must have very much
studied these Matters. Now they were in Number <hi>Thirty and
two,</hi> and no more, who had all contracted this Mischief before
they came into the House, and had learn'd it some of their
Relations, and some of their Companions, and all in different
Places, different Towns, Villages and Parishes.</p>
            <p>119. I was in great perplexity, having never believed that
there was such Creatures in the World, at least very rarely;
and that they had something peculiar outwardly to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
about them; but that these Children performing all
pious Exercises, I could not perswade my self that they
were such. But be it as it would, I asked the Pastors if there
was no Remedy. They said there was, since that they had been
gained by the Devil before their age of Reason. I told them
that we must spare nothing, but use all possible Endeavours.
The Chaplain, Pastors, and the Capuchin Fathers, Exorci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
them two Hours a day, each Man twice a Week. The
Pastor of the Parish where the House stood, which was St.
<hi>Saviour</hi>'s, came often to interrogate them to discover more
and more the Truth, and to endeavour to reconcile them by
Confessions and Penances.</p>
            <p>120. He wrote down their Examinations for his Memory
sake. They formerly declared that they had daily carnal
Cohabitation with the Devil; that they went to the Sabbaths
or Meetings, where they Eat, Drank, Danc'd, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
other Whoredom and Sensualities. Every one had her
Devil in form of a Man; and the Men had their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
in the form of a Woman. And that there were so great
a number of Persons at these Nocturnal Assemblies, where
every Devil brought from day to day their Love whether
Male or Female, that no Assemblies were ever seen so Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
in the City as in those Sabbaths, where came People of
all Qualities and Conditions, Young and Old, Rich and Poor,
Noble and Ignoble, but especially all sorts of Monks and
Nuns, Priests and Prelates; and that every one took his place
as they do in the World: that they there Worshiped a Beast,

with which they committed infamous things, and then at last
they burnt it; and every one took up some of the Ashes, with
the which they made Men or Beasts to Languish, or Die;
declaring some of them particularly, that they had made use
of them to kill Poultry and other Creatures.</p>
            <p>121. After they had declared all these things to the said
Pastor and to me, they would sometimes say, that there was
nothing in it; then again they would ratifie all by confirming
it anew: And after that would deny it; and then confess it
again. So that I continued Eight Months in these Exorcises,
letting no Body know it but those Divines. During this time
between whiles they made General Confessions, wept in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of Sorrow and Repentance: But all was but Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit,
their Hearts being addicted to sensual Pleasures,
which the Devil gave them. They had not the least design
of changing, to quit these abominable Pleasures, as one of
them of Twenty two Years old one day told me. <hi>No,</hi> said
she, <hi>I will not be other than I am; I find too much content in
my Condition; I am always Caressed.</hi> I have had of them
from Eight Years of Age to Twenty two. The Elder of
them told me, <hi>We are often afraid of being with Child by the
Devil; for we should thereby be discovered that it was by the
Devil, because we never see any Men come into the Cloister.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>122. About this time a Woman of the Town was very
importunate with me to take a Girl of Nine years Old out of
Charity. I yielded to her Desire. But thinking to teach
her and make her Work, she would do nothing; so that one
day going to Correct her, she said, the Devil held her
Hands, and she could do nothing. The others Laughing
cry'd, that she was out of their Gang. And indeed after I
had Examined her, she told me more particulars than the
others had done, saying that she could kill Cows tho they
were two Leagues distant. I immediately turn'd her off,
having enough of that sort already. The Woman who had
recommended her to me, understanding by this Child what
passed in the House, and that every one had confessed this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
she presented a Petition against me to the Magistrate, saying
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53434:19"/>
that I abused the Children, and that I should take away their
Reputation by believing that they were Witches, and that
she gave this Advertisement to the Magistrate, out of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Love that she bore to those Children.</p>

            <p>81. BUt the Fifth discovered it self about three Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
I had been Cloistered up, and began by a young
Wench of the Village of about Fifteen years of Age, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
done some Offence, was to be corrected by being shut up
by her self, which the House-keeper by my Order did. And
after having shut up the said Girl, she took the Key with her,
and went out of Doors: But about an Hour after she was
gone, the Girl came into the School where the others were at
Work, who seeing her coming, turned all Pale; and being ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
what made them change their Countenance? They told me
that they saw before them at the School door the Girl that had
been shut up, whose Name was <hi>Bellot;</hi> and being bid to come
in if she was at the Door, she came up and ask'd me Pardon
for her Fault, promising to Amend. I asked her if she had not
been shut up by the House-keeper? She said yes. How then
came you forth, said I? She held her Tongue for some
time; but being pressed to Answer, she said, that a Man had
let her out. This I took for Raving, because I knew that
no Man, or other Person, could be in the House. But not
being willing to make further enquiry before the rest, I bid
her take her Work and be good hereafter. In a little time
after, when the House-keeper returned from her business
Abroad, and saw this Girl at her Work, she was <hi>Astonished,</hi>
crying, Who is it that hath opened the Door for this Child?
I had shut three Doors upon her, and see here the Keys at
my Girdle. I went out of the School to inform my self from
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53434:19"/>
the House-keeper, if she had really locked up the Doors?
she answered me, she had, and going to the Doors, found
them all three Lock'd, as she had left them. This thing
troubled me; and after Dinner I call'd the said Girl into my
own Chamber, to know of her how she got out of so fast a
Place. She said that a Man opened the Door for her. I
asked what Man this might be, and if she knew him. Yes,
she said she knew him very well, and that he was the
Devil. At which I was struck with Horror, saying,
The Devil's Spirit, he is not a Man. Tho he be a Spirit
said she, he comes to me in the shape of a Man; and as I
call'd him to my Assistance when I was shut up, he came to
me, opened the Door and let me out. I asked her how
long she had known this Man-Devil (or Devil of a Man?)
She said all the days of her Life: That her Mother had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
her with her when she was very Young, and had even
carried her in her Arms to the Witches Sabbaths or
Assemblies, which were held in the Night; and that being
a little Wench, this Man-Devil was then a little Boy too,
and grew up as she did, having been always her Love,
and Caressed her Day and Night. I could not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
this Discourse, having never hear'd the like in my
Life.</p>
            <p>83. I immediately wrote to the three fore-mentioned Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
to desire them to come to my House, where there was
a Girl who told me things which I had not capacity enough
to understand; desiring that they would come and Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min
her to know what it might be. They came all three
together the same day, and having Examined the Girl, she
declared to them that she had given her Soul to the Devil,
and had renounced God; and to confirm the donation of
her Soul, she had received a mark upon her Foot: That this
Contract had been made at Twelve Years old; but that
long before that time this Love of hers had accompanied her,
and carried her at Nights to the Witches Meetings in great
Castles, where they assembled to Eat, Drink, Dance, Sing,
and act a thousand other insolencies, with many other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53434:20"/>
which she could not know unless she had been a
Witch, or had studied Books of Magick, which could not
be, she beginning then but to learn her Letters, having been
but a little while in my House. I told the Pastors that I
would not endure any longer such a Person in my House,
lest she should spoil my other Girls; and I placed her out
the same day with a Woman whom I knew to be of a good
Life, from whence a little time after a Man came and took
her away, saying, he had Married her Mother, and he
would be her Father; and so I never heard more of the said
<hi>Bellot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>84. I was much troubled in my mind to see that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
had yet so much Power as to trouble a House of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
of which I had undertaken the Government for the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of God, and the Salvation of Souls. I often Examined
my self what fault I might have committed, that should give
the Devil so much power as to send a Witch into my House,
when I thought there had been but few of them in the World.
And tho I could not believe that the said <hi>Bellot</hi> was a Witch, yet
I found that the Devil had great Power over her. Not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
however what sort of Creature a Witch must be, having
often thought that Witches were ugly deformed Creatures,
or half Beasts, as they say of them, that they do transform
themselves into Cats, Horses, and other Animals; so that I
could not believe that this Girl was a Witch, tho the three
Pastors aforesaid, did assure me of it. I Pray'd to God to
discover to me my secret Sins, not knowing to what Cause I
might attribute so strange an Accident, which intruded it
self amongst my good Intentions. However, I kept regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on the Discipline of my House, believing that I had got
rid of such kind of Persons, by dismissing the said <hi>Bellot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>85. But three Months, <hi>(viz.</hi> after the Discovery of a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
about Fifteen Years old, who is not here mentioned,
tho she be in the former Treatise, and was sent away three
Months after the first; so that this happen'd six Months
after the first. See <hi>La. Parole de Dieu, §. 116.—121.)</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:53434:20"/>
afterwards we discovered another, which said and did
the same things. This was a Girl Born in the town, which
had always been Nursed in the Village, of about Twelve
Years old, who for the evil custom she had gotten of Steal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
was one day to have been Whipped; which being not
willing to submit to, she said somebody had advised her to
Steal, whom she would tell me of if I would forgive her that
time. I then forbore her, to the end I might know what
evil Creature it was that gave her that advice. I call'd her
into my Chamber alone, thinking I should discover some
other of the Girls that Counselled her to Steal; she presently
fell a Crying, and would not answer me a Word. But a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
after she said it was the Devil that gave her this evil
Counsel. I gave a great Sigh, telling her that she said this
only to cover her Wickedness, for that she could not know
the Devil. She replied, that she knew him very well; that
he was a Boy a little bigger than her self; and that he was
her Love, and lay with her every Night. I asked her how
long she had known him. She said, that being very Young
and playing with the Girls in the Village, they ask'd her if
she would go with them to the Dedication; that she should
have good Chear and a Sweet-heart into the Bargain. And
as soon as she consented, her said Lover came upon a little
Horse, and took her by the Hand, asking her if she would
be his Mistress, and she saying Ay, she was catched up into
the Air with him and the other Girls, and they flew all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to a great Castle, where they play'd upon Instruments,
Danc'd, Feasted and drank Wine: And that ever since she
had been there three or four times a Week; that at Ten
Years old she had given her Soul to the Devil, renounced
God and her Baptism, and received a <hi>Mark</hi> from the Devil
upon her Head; which we afterwards found to be true, for
that she was insensible in the place where the said Mark was
made; for we stuck a Pin as long as ones little Finger into
her Head, and she felt no Pain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:53434:21"/>
86. I immediately sent to the aforesaid three Pastors to
come and Examin this second Girl, who said almost the
same things as the first. And after that they had Examined
her, they told me that she was also a Witch; and that I
ought not to turn her out of my House 'till I had discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
whence this Misfortune came; that there must be some
Witch in the House that thus drew the Children after her.
I followed their advice by keeping this Girl in the House;
but confining her in a Chamber separate from the rest; where
necessaries were brought her and also her Work. One of
these Pastors, call'd <hi>Peter Salmon,</hi> undertook to Examin her
every day, to the end he might bring her to a good Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
to renounce the Devil, and to return to God: And ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
if there were no more Children in the House, who were
such as her self, she said that there were two more that
went with her every day to the Sabbaths. And having exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
separately the other two Girls whether there was any
truth in it, they ingenuously confessed, that they were bound to
the Devil by a precise Contract, and had consigned their Souls
to him. Understanding this, I resolved to send away all the
Children that I could, fearing that instead of procuring the
Salvation of their Souls by keeping them with me, they
would by teaching one another their Wickedness, all be
Damned. I could not send them away all, by reason that
the greatest part of them were so poor, that they had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Friends nor Houses to be received in. And for this
reason I was still obliged to keep <hi>two and Thirty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>87. The said Pastor <hi>Salmon</hi> began for his Memory sake
to write down what these Girls had said to him, being all
three in distinct Apartments: And having spoken often
with them, the two last said, that there were still two more
in the House, and that they for their pars need not be taken
out from the rest. But asking them who the others were,
they each of them named two different Names. And having
Examined the said Four, they confessed that it was all true;
and named each of them two different Names, which were
of the same Diabolical Company; so that from Two to Four,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53434:21"/>
and from Four to Eight, we discerned that the Thirty two
yet remaining in the House, were all in general, and each in
particular given up to the Devil, by their own proper and
deliberate consent: And that not one of them Contracted
this Wickedness in the House, but brought it with them thither,
having diversly fallen into it, some by their Fathers, some by
their Mothers, and some by playing with other little Girls
together, as they declared as well to me, as to the said Pastor,
who put all the Particulars which they told him in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
            <p>88. I was mightily perplexed to find my self confined to a
House with two and Thirty Creatures, who declared that
they had all given their Souls to the Devil. The Maids I
had for my assistance went all away, leaving me alone with
these wicked Wretches, with whom I was forced to Eat and
Drink, at least what they Dressed for me. I held divers
Consults with the said three Pastors, what was fit to be done
upon such an Occasion. I proposed to dismiss them by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees;
but then I feared I should be guilty of the mischief
that they would do among Man-kind, when they were abroad;
for they confessed to me, that they had Killed both People
and Cattle, which I also afterward found by Experience,
they having killed all of a sudden thirty young Ducks, Cats,
Chickens, and other Animals about the House in less than two
Hours time, which they have often Confessed. Wherefore I
could not honestly turn them out, lest I should wrong my
Neighbours by sending them such Persons as these, without
giving them Notice; and by advertising of them, none would
receive them.</p>
            <p>89. Upon this, I was greatly Dispirited, and could not
see what was the Will of God in this point. The Pastors
on the other hand said, I ought to let them all continue with
me, and that they hoped they might convert them to God,
because they were engaged to the Devil in their Child-hood
before they had the use of their Reason; offering me to do
their utmost, saying that they would come every day to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
and <hi>Exorcise</hi> them, and Pray for their Conversion. And
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53434:22"/>
And having asked them if it were possible that these Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
could be converted to God after having deny'd him
and given their Souls to the Devil; they answered me that
they might; that God was Merciful; and that as wicked as
Men could be, they might be Converted so long as they were
in this World. Which is very true; but since that time I
have had sufficient Experience that Persons thus contracted
to the Devil do not turn, because they have no real desire
to be Converted, tho they make a shew as if they had.</p>
            <p>90. I resolved then to keep the said Children with me,
exhorting them all I could to be converted to God: And the
said Pastors came every day one or other of them to Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
them and to Pray with them. Which we did very se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
for the space of about eight Months: During which
time, the Girls made great shew of Conversion, by Tears,
repeated Confessions, Prayers and attention to the Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which were made them.</p>
            <p>91. Many of them seemed to melt into Tears, when I
spoke to them of the Judgments of God, Eternal Life, the
Joys of Paradise, and the Torments of Hell. But this last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not long. And when I Examined some of the eldest and
most sensible of them whether these Tears were Feigned, and
Counterfeit, or else Sincere; they answered me, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from their Grief for having denied God, and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd
themselves to the Devil. But that this lasted no longer
than whilst they were spoken to, and had their miserable
Estate before them: That the Devil came presently to them,
and asked them, how they could leave him, and all the
Pleasures they had taken together? And Caressed them
so much, that they immediately made a new Contract with
him, forgetting all the good Purposes they had taken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>92. I asked them, if the <hi>Admonitions, Exorcisms and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the Pastors,</hi> did not take away the Power of the Devil,
from holding them thus subjected to him? They told me that
<hi>the Devil Laugh'd at these Performances;</hi> and that after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of a Monky he mimick'd the same Ceremonies that the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53434:22"/>
Pastors did; when they Kneel'd down to Pray, the Devil
kneel'd behind them, and with a Book in his Hand he bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
out the same words; and when the said Pastors Preach'd,
the Devil made behind them the same Gestures, and sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
about the Holy Water; and also Confess'd them as the
Pastors did, imitating them in every thing in Derision and
Mockery.</p>
            <p>93. I asked them, <hi>How they could Pray or sing so many good
Prayers</hi> all the day long, when they were thus in League
with the Devil? They told me, that he himself Pray'd and
Sung along with them, by reason that their Prayers were
without <hi>Attention:</hi> And that instead of singing to praise God,
their <hi>Intentions</hi> were to sing the praises of the Devil, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he gloried and valued himself.</p>
            <p>94. I asked them how they could approach the Table of
the Lord and receive the <hi>Sacrament?</hi> They said, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
invited them to do it as often as they could; and that
the greatest Penance that I could enjoin them, was to make
them abstain from this Sacrament, which was a Cloak for
their Wickedness, and made them pass for good Folk before
the World. Besides, that the <hi>Devil wrought his greatest Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies
with this Consecrated Bread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>95. I asked them, <hi>How it was that they could Fast,</hi> even
tho they were not obliged to it? For from Fourteen or Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
years old they would Fast out the whole <hi>Lent.</hi> And
when I would have hindred them, they Wept bitterly.
They told me that they fasted but out of hypocrisie and to
please me: And because they had every night a Glass of
strong Beer, and a greater portion at Dinner than those who
did not Fast. That for these Reasons they did desire to keep
Fast.</p>
            <p>96. I told them that all these falsities would certainly
bring them to Hell. Their answer was, that they very well
knew it; and that they were assured to be Damned; but
that the Devil promised them the same carnal and sensual
Pleasures in Hell, that they took with him in this World</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:53434:23"/>
97. I asked them if they were certain that this was the
Devil, who thus entertained them; and if whethether they
knew that there was a Hell and a Heaven before they
came to live in my House? They told me, Yes, because the
Devil had taught them it, and had often Catechised them,
and taught 'em that there is a God, a Heaven and Hell,
and a Devil; and that he that did the Devil's Will, could
never see God, but should be his Companion in Hell to
Eternity. I was very much astonished to hear these Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
having never thought that the Devil could teach so good
things, or excite People to Pray, Fast, and frequent the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
or to think of Heaven and Hell. Nevertheless,
by long Experience I have found it to be very true.</p>
            <p>98. I asked them, how it was possible that they should
belong to the Devil from their tender Infancy, even before
they had use of their Reason? They said, that that came
from their Parents; and when their Fathers or their Mothers
are themselves abandoned to the Devil, of necessity all their
Children are so also till they arrive to the use of their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
because that their Fathers and their Mothers have
power over the Souls of their Children, until they come to
use their own Judgment, and that then the Child receives
its Free Will, and can make use of it to do Good or Evil:
But that it was very rare when they had been Sacrificed and
offered to the Devil by Father or Mother, even before they
were Born, that they should withdraw themselves from him,
when they came of Years; because that the habit of Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
is become Natural to 'em; and the Devil having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd
them from their Birth with Caresses and sensual
Pleasures, so gains their Affections, that they will not quit
them for any consideration, after having been allured to Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sualities,
such as no Man could give them: For the Devil
feigns to make them eat all sorts of delicious Meat to their
Taste, all sorts of pleasant Wines to their Pallate, all sorts of
Musick, or Instruments to their Ear; all sorts of Beauty to
their Eyes, and all Perfumes to their Smell, and all manner
of Titillations to their Flesh: So that being brought up there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53434:23"/>
it is as it were impossible to have a mind to leave him.
And therefore it is that they say, <hi>We will not change our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
for the greatest Pleasure that Mankind can give us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>99. I condoled with them their Misfortune, shewing them
that this was all Deceit and meer Illusion; that the Devil had
no thing, nor could he give any thing. And to shew that they
had neither eaten nor drank at the Sabbaths, they needed but
observe their own Appetites on Mornings, when they eat
great pieces of Bread and Butter, and would eat dry Bread
if it was given them, which if they had eaten such dainty
Meat, they would not touch, nor could they eat such gross
Meat so soon with so good an Appetite; for had they been at
a Feast with Men and drank Wine as they said they did
at the Devil's Banquets, they would be Sick all the next day.
They told me this was all true, but however they had the
taste and pleasure of all these things, and therefore would not
forsake 'em.</p>
            <p>100. I informed my self sometimes as exactly as I could,
to know how it was possible that a Father or a Mother could
offer their Children to the Devil, instead of offering them to
God who Created them, asking them in what manner this
was Practised? They told me, that Persons who were thus
engaged to the Devil by a precise Contract, will allow no
other God but him, and therefore offer him whatsoever is
dearest to them; nay, are constrained to offer him their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
or else the Devil would Beat them, and contrive that
they should never arrive to the State of Marriage, and so
should have no Children, by reason that the Devil hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
by his Adherents, to hinder both the one and the other; and
that this is effected in this manner.</p>
            <p>111. When a child thus offered to the Devil by its
Parents, comes to the use of Reason, the Devil then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
its Soul, and makes it deny God and renounce Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
and all relating to the Faith, promising Homage and
Fealty to the Devil in manner of a Marriage, and instead of
a Ring, the Devil gives them a Mark with an Iron Mark
upon some part of the Body; which Marks they renew as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53434:24"/>
as those Persons have any desire to quit him. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
reproves them then more severely and obligeth them to
new Promises, making them also new Marks for assurance
or pledge, that those Persons should continue faithful to him,
and so soon as they come to be able to beget Children, the
Devil makes them offer the desire which they have of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying,
to his Honor: And with this all the Fruit that may
proceed from their Marriage. This they promise volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
to the end that they may accomplish their Designs:
For otherwise the Devil threatens to hinder them by all
manner of means, that they shall not Marry, nor have Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>

them: Which Madam <hi>B.</hi> acknowledged to be true, obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
with some admiration how those little Creatures Swam
and provided for themselves so well, being but just out of the
Shell. She thereby experienced this terrible truth, <hi>That the
Devil hath power over whatsoever a Man placeth his affections
in, when they are not upon God.</hi> And indeed Man being Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
only to take pleasure in God, who ought to be his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light;
'tis impossible but that a Curse should follow whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
breaks this Order.</p>
            <p>2. Another time they made it Rain so furiously into the
Common Room where they were at work, that Madam <hi>B.</hi>
was forced to go out all wet as she was. One of them ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
day having cast some Powder into the Oven of the
House when they were Baking of Bread, tho the Oven was
so hot that the very Bricks of it were red, yet the Bread
which was put in remained there six whole Hours, no more
Baked than when it was put in: And Madam <hi>B.</hi> having
asked the Cook-maid the reason of it, she said that such a
Girl who had stop'd the Oven, had thrown in some Powder,
and that the Fire would never touch the Bread, although it
should remain there all the day long; but that she would
take care when they Baked next, that that Wench should
not come near the Oven; which being done, the Bread was
Baked as throughly in two Hours time as Sea Bisket. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time one of them thought fit to cast a Charm in amongst
the Meat boyling in the Pot; Where having boyl'd six
Hours together, it came out as raw and bloody as it
came from the Shambles. They have often said since,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53434:25"/>
that were it not that the Devil was afraid that we should
be convinced by extraordinary things, he would make us
work Miracles; but he fears nothing like that. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
that they had often given their Powders to the Mother
Regent, which operated according to the intention of her
who gave them. One day Madam <hi>B.</hi> finding her self ill
with a sore Throat, one of the Girls told her, <hi>I know well
enough what's the matter; it is but the effect of a little Powder,
she'll be Cur'd in four days time, but not with the Ointments
which are prepared for her.</hi> All the Month of <hi>January</hi> and
part of <hi>February</hi> in the year 1662, it was almost every day
discovered, that some one or other of these Girls had been
corrupted in their particular Assemblies, besides their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Sabbaths, where they had Balls of Poyson given them
to Kill Madam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Bourignon;</hi> and they would have Poyson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Pastor of St. <hi>Saviours</hi> Church, who was to come and
Officiate and Dine there upon St. <hi>Anthony</hi>'s day. As fast as
those Poysons were taken from them, which they usually
hid in their Beds, they got more, which St. <hi>Saulieu</hi> furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them with in this Assembly, with design never to have
done till they had killed her. <hi>We'll make so many,</hi> said they,
<hi>that one of them shall do at last; and then when she's Dead, St.</hi>
Saulieu <hi>shall come here, with whom we shall agree well enough,
and then we may keep our Dancings in the School it self.</hi> These
Balls were put into the hands of the Governor and Secretary,
when they came at last to visit the Hospitals, upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
which Madam <hi>B.</hi> had made of the Matter: And the
Secretary said, when he took them away; <hi>I carry off the
Devil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. 'Twould be impossible to relate all that these Girls
confess'd when they were Discovered, concerning themselves,
their Parents, their Education, their Companions, their
Neighbours, and People of the same Towns and Villages;
nay, their very Pastors and their Lords, their Sabbaths and
Assemblies, their Transports through the Air, where they
said they had been Transported over great Forests in the
Air, their Feet would sometimes touch the top Branches of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53434:25"/>
the Trees, as they flew to these Sabbaths, whose devilish
Ceremonies they did relate, their abominable Divertisements
and Whoredoms with the Devils in Human shape, from
whom they said they received something very Cold, of which
they were sometimes afraid to become with Child, and a
thousand detestable Devilries, which would be horrible to
relate; and which I will pass over in silence, as also those
which are related by Madam <hi>B.</hi> her self in the former Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises,
except some few, which I had from her Mouth.</p>
            <p>4. When this Mischief began first to appear, there was
one amongst them very Industrious to discover the rest,
which having done, and thereby thinking her self to be
out of all suspicion of being still of the Company, yet
at last she was found out: But she constantly deni'd it,
although the others did affirm that she went with them to the
Sabbaths; she defended her self upon this Point, That there
could be no Colour that she who had assisted in the Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of the rest, should be Guilty, and still an accomplice
of the same Crime. Nevertheless, this was the most wicked,
false and cunning of them all. And this proceeding of hers,
was but an effect of her devilish Cunning. This was she who
a little after said, she would not renounce the Devil, nor
amend, nor did she desire to be other than what she was;
and was one of the first of those upon whom those Diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Poysons were found, with which they intended to Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their Benefactress. She would have denied all at first,
but at length confessed, after which she denied it, and advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the rest so to do, and to make feigned Confessions, advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
them to deny all they had confessed before. One day
as she was upon her Denials, when the Life of St. <hi>Anthony</hi>
was reading in their Presence, wherein was mentioned a
Temptation that the Devil used by melodious Singing, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>B.</hi> saying, I never observed yet that the Devil Sung,
and I wonder at it; the Girl answered, O Mother, they Sing
so delicately that you would be even Ravished to hear them.
How! do they Sing so well said she? Ay indeed, said the Girl,
for they were Angels once. All the rest fell a Laughing: And
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53434:26"/>
she was so confounded for having so openly confessed before
she was aware, that she knew not what to say; but endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to excuse her self, one of her Companions said, Go,
Go, you have said too much that you have hear'd how
well they Sing; you cannot answer that. If I have heard
them, faith she with anger, you have heard them as well as
I. Sometime after she again confessed her self Guilty. One
of the reasons for which she said she would not be Convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
then, nor renounce Satan, was that the Devil told them
sometimes that they might be saved well enough if they
were Converted hereafter; and that it would be time enough
if they repented upon their Death-beds, and were Convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
then; and so they might take their Pleasures and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimes,
which the Devil gave them while they might have
them.</p>
            <p>5. It happen'd about this time, that <hi>the Devil</hi> in a merry
Mood <hi>Appeared to Madam B.</hi> in this manner. There came
one and knock'd at the Gate of the Hospital, and asked to
speak with the Regent, who was then all alone without
assistance to help her in the affairs of so great a House. When
she came to the Gate, she there found <hi>a little wrinkled wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth'd
Woman,</hi> yet very nimble and brisk, who offered her
her Service in her present occasion. Madam <hi>B.</hi> having ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
known nor seen this Old Woman, and seeing nothing in
her to recommend her, she told her she could not take her,
because her age and weakness were too great to undergo the
Labour and Orders of the House. But the Old Woman an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
shaking her Breech, No, no, I have a great deal of
Vigor yet: I can Work, I can Watch, I can rise on Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
I can Fast, I can Pray, I can be a good Housewife,
you'll find I can do any thing; and began to Talk and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
very pleasantly, and with great earnestness to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in. But Madam <hi>B.</hi> being call'd away to speak with a
Physician who came into the Hospital, when she came back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to speak with the old Woman whom she had bid to stay,
found neither the old Woman, nor any appearance of her,
nor could she ever know from any Body who she was, or
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53434:26"/>
whence she came, nor had any Body seen her besides. She
told the Doctor of it, who said, he saw her not as he came
in. But the Girls fell all a Laughing, saying, it was the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
which they knew very well; and that he came only to
play the Rogue with her. Of which she was afterwards satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
            <p>6. Speaking to them one day of some Girls of the House
that lately dyed with <hi>great demonstrations of Piety,</hi> they said,
that they were also of their Number. And when she said,
that that was impossible, because those Girls died in <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sports
of Piety, and calling upon the name of Jesus Christ;</hi> nay,
that one of them said but the day before she Died, that
<hi>Jesus Christ had appeared</hi> to her, and assured her that he
would come fetch her to Morrow at such an Hour, when in
effect she Died, singing and rejoicing that she was going to
Paradise. These Girls fell a Laughing, and told her, that
this Apparition of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> was the Devil; that all those
Prayers and Exclamations to God, were addressed to the
Devil; and that by these words, God and Jesus Christ, by
reservation to themselves they meant the Devil, to whom
they directed all their Prayers; and that by the word Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,
they understood no other thing than the Company of
<hi>Satan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. Madam <hi>B.</hi> having asked one of them one day, why
she did not confess this wickedness sooner: She answered,
that being so common a thing, she did not think there was
any harm in it, or a thing to be confessed, alledging to her
that Millions of People of all degrees, were in the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and that she scarce knew any others. She answered,
Alas! you saw well, that I was no such Person. How say
you then you scarce know ony others? <hi>O Mother,</hi> said
the Girl, <hi>you are not like other People, for there are very few
such as you in the World.</hi> They declared to her furthermore,
that the Devils were almost always with them, whether they
were in their particular Chambers, or in the common Room
where they worked: But when Madam <hi>B.</hi> was there <hi>they
durst not appear:</hi> That <hi>they feared her so much,</hi> that when
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53434:27"/>
she but moved the Latch of the Door to come in, or when
they heard her but walk, speak, or but cough, they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
for fear vanished like Lightning: Which greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
what <hi>Fr. de la Croix</hi> saith of <hi>Souls strongly united to
God,</hi> that they <hi>become terrible to the Devils,</hi> as a Moth whose
Wings are scorch'd at the flame of a Candle, is afraid to come
at it again.</p>
            <p>8. They confirmed often their Declarations in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the three Pastors, who were Inspectors of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spital,
who came to Examin them, and declared positively
that they were Witches. Coming to Exorcise them for their
Conversion, but in vain, one of them wrote down their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations,
which were at last presented to the Magistrates,
where they remained till such time as he should please to
take cognizance of the Matter. It is true that the greatest
part of them denied all again before the Court; but it
was too gross an Imposture. They were threatned on
the one hand and caressed on the other. Nevertheless, one
of them notwithstanding all Menaces, remained firm in her
first Declaration, that she was a Witch as well as the others;
nor would she deny it tho she should have died on the spot.
This poor Creature was engaged to the Devil from her
Childhood, and when she came to years of Reason, she
yielded to the desires of the Devil, by ratifying the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
she had entred into in her Childhood; but she
with another younger Girl were sometimes so touched with
Repentance, that she Lamented and Wept when the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of her sin and horrible condition were lay'd before her.
It was she that Lamented the Death of Madam <hi>B.</hi> for a
whole day together, when they resolved to Poyson her upon
the first opportunity, with Pills of diabolical Composition,
and that discovered the thing to her.</p>
            <p>9. <hi>Madam</hi> B. <hi>asked her some time after, why instead of
continuing of the Cabal that had conspired her Death, she had
on the contrary so much lamented it, and discovered the Plot?
She answered,</hi> Because I love you more than the Devil, and
had rather be faithful to you than to him: Oh that I could but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>escape
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53434:27"/>
his Snares! But I cannot: He has too great access to
me. I would to God that when you speak to me, and that when
I find my Heart touched with Repentance and lament my Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
that somebody was present to cut my Throat; I should
then have hope of Grace and of Salvation; but otherwise I am lost
and cannot be saved: For as soon as you leave me, the Devil
returns and does accost me by Caresses, by Threatnings,
by Kindnesses; and never leaves me till seeing me without any
Body to help, he regains my consent, and I give my self to him
again. Nothing can deliver me from him without taking me out
of the World when I am in a state of Repentance, as sometimes
I am. To let me live longer, is but to remit me into the
power of the Devil. Oh! how glad would I be if any Body would
kill me out of Charity, when I deplore my Misery. <hi>These were
the complaints of this poor Creature, (a just Object of Pity)
made to Madam</hi> B. <hi>Nevertheless, she did not obtain the
favour she desired: For having always held firm in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation
which she made before the Court, that she was a
Witch, instead of putting her to Death, as she desired, she
was shut up in Prison, and it was never known what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
of her since.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such Witches so capable of Repentance, are very rare.
However, it thereby appears, that the Law of God, which
commands not to suffer a Witch to Live, was not only a
Law of Justice, but also a Law of Charity; and that what
you call shewing them Mercy, is a great Cruelty, since that
Death may conduce to Salvation to those who are capable
to Repent, and Life would certainly be pernicious: And for
those who are not capable to Repent, it were better that
they should go to all the Devils, rather than multiply their
Crimes upon Earth, whereby they would augment their
eternal Pains.</p>

            <head>A Relation of a Yarmouth Witch, who with Fifteen
more Convicted upon their own Confessions, was
Executed, 1644.</head>
            <p>IN the Year 1644. at <hi>Yarmouth</hi> were sixteen Women accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for Witches by Mr. <hi>Hopkins,</hi> and by the Magistrates
sent to Mr. <hi>Whitfeild</hi> and Mr. <hi>Brinsley</hi> Ministers of that Place,
to be by them Examined. Among these was an Old Woman
who used to be relieved twice a Week at Mr. <hi>Whitfeild</hi>'s
Door, who made this <hi>Confession;</hi> That she using to work for
Mr. <hi>Moulton</hi> (a Stocking Merchant and Alderman of the
Town) went to his House for Work, but he being from
Home, his Man refused to let her have any till his Master
came home, which was not expected in less than a Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night's
time; whereupon being <hi>Exasperated</hi> against the Man,
she applied her self to the Maid, and desired some Knitting
Work of her; and when she returned the like Answer, she
went home in great discontent and anger against them both:
That that Night when she was in Bed, she heard one knock
at her Door, and rising to her Window, she saw, it being
Moon light, <hi>a tall black Man</hi> there; and asking what he
would have? He told her that he understood that she was
<hi>Discontented,</hi> because she could not get Work, as she expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and that he would put her into a way that she should
never want either Work or any thing else; whereupon she
let him in, and asked him what he had then to say to her?
He told her, he must first see her Hand; and then taking
out something like a Pen-knife, he gave it <hi>a little Scratch,</hi> so
that Blood followed, and the <hi>Mark</hi> remained to that time,
which she then shewed them; then he took some of the
Blood in a Pen, and pulling a Book out of his Pocket, bid her
<hi>write her Name;</hi> and when she said, she could not, he said,
he would guide her Hand, and thereupon did so, and wrote
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53434:28"/>
her Name in his Book. When this was done, he bid her
now ask what she would have: And when she desired first
to be revenged of the Man, he promised to give her an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of it the next Night, and so leaving her some Mony,
went away for that time. The next Night he came to her
again, and told her he could do nothing against the Man;
for he <hi>went constantly to Church</hi> to hear <hi>Whitfeild</hi> and <hi>Brinsly,</hi>
and <hi>said his Prayers Morning and Evening.</hi> Then she desired
him to revenge her on <hi>the Maid;</hi> and he again promised her
to give her an account thereof the next Night; but then he
said the same of the Maid, and that therefore he could not
hurt her: But he said, that there was a young Child in the
House, which was more easie to be dealt with. Whereupon
she desired him to do what he could against it: And the
next Night he came again, and brought with him an Image
of Wax, and told her they must go and Bury that in the
Church-yard, and then the Child which he had put into great
pain already should waste and consume away as that Image
wasted. Whereupon they went together, and he dug a
hole with a Spade which he brought with him, and they
Buried it. And when he left her, he bid her when ever she
wanted any thing, but wish for him to come, and he would
presently be with her. The Child having at this time
lain in a Languishing condition for about Eighteen Months,
and being very near to Death, the Minister sent this Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
with this account to the Magistrates, who thereupon
sent her to Mr. <hi>Moulton</hi>'s; where in the same Room where
the Child lay almost Dead, she was again Examined con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Particulars aforesaid; all which she confessed
again, and had no sooner done, but the Child, who was but
three Years old, and was thought to be Dead or Dying,
Laughed, and began to stir and raise up it self; and from
that Instant began to Recover. It was then late in the
Night before they had done, so that they could not then
search for the Image of Wax, but ordered it to be
done early the next Morning; and then the Woman being
led to the Church-yard, set her Foot upon a certain place,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53434:29"/>
and said, that was the place where it was Buried. But tho
they dug and sought for it as well as they could, they could
find nothing; whether because it was so wasted, that they
lost the relicks of it in the Digging, or removed by the Devil,
or whatever else was the reason, it could not be found; but
the Child Recovered. This Woman and all the rest were
<hi>Convicted</hi> upon their own Confessions, and were <hi>Condemned,
and Executed</hi> accordingly. They had and all their <hi>Familiars,</hi> and
this Womans did usually appear in the form of a Black-Bird.</p>
            <p>This from a Son of <hi>Mr. Whitfeild's,</hi> who was then present; and
to this I shall subjoin another of like nature in some Particulars,
which tho I had it but at second hand, and therefore probably may
not be compleat in all particulars, yet had I it from a competent
Relator, who had the first Relation from an ancient credible Person,
who was then a Scholar in <hi>Oxford,</hi> when the Tryal was, and <hi>I</hi>

            <p>IN this time, (but the Year is not remembred) a Man
Died there, leaving two Daughters, and good Portions to
each: The Eldest somewhat Prodigal, Married a Husband
like her self, who spent her Portion, got her with Child, and
left her: But the Youngest being very Serious and Religious,
staid, two or three Years before she Married, and then Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
a good honest sober Farmer, six or seven Miles off, by
whom she had a Child, and they lived very happily and
comfortably together. This moved great Envy against her
in her Sister, who was reduced to great Straits. In her
Passion the Devil appeared to her, and she made a Contract
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53434:29"/>
with him, and became a Witch; and he perswaded her to
kill her Sisters Child, as the greatest despight she could do
her. For this purpose she often rose in the Night out of her
Bed, got upon a Bed-staff, said certain words, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was presently carried away, and was conveyed into the
Room where her Sister with her Husband and Child lay.
This her own Child about Seven years of Age, who lay
with her, having often observed her to do, at last it would
do so too, and thereupon was presently carried through the
Air into the same Room, where the Mother and some others
were, who after some time went all away, and the Child
being left behind, fell a Crying; at which the Man and his
Wife being awakened, and wondering to hear a Child Cry
in their Room, the Man arose and lighted a Candle, and
finding the Child, and understanding by it how it came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the next day they acquainted a Justice of the Peace
with the Matter. Whereupon the Sister was Apprehended,
and Committed, and the next Assizes was Tryed for a Witch:
And the Child, who was all the while kept from her, being
then produced, told how it came into that Room, and what
it had seen and hear'd the Mother say and do; whereupon,
the Mother confessed all the Matter before related. The
Judge then ask'd her if she had never been there before in
that manner? She said Yes, an hundred times. Then he
asked her, How it came to pass that she did not kill the
Child all that while? She answered, That she always found
it so armed with the Prayers of the Parents, that she could
never have power to do it. Upon her Confession, she was
Condemned, and Executed.</p>

in the Year, 1649.</head>
            <p>AT <hi>Droitwich</hi> in the Country of <hi>Worcester,</hi> a poor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
Boy in the Month of <hi>May,</hi> looking for his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Cow, espied some Bushes in a Brake to shake, and
supposing the Cow to be Brousing there, went to the Place,
where he found no Cow, but an Old Woman, who upon
his approach said <hi>Boh,</hi> to him; whereupon he presently lost
his speech, and could only make a Noise, but could not
speak any thing articulately so as could be understood: In
this condition he came home to his Mother, made a great
Noise, but no body could understand what ailed him, or
what he meant. A while after, he ran out, and at Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Barret's</hi> Door, found, about one a Clock amongst other
poor People, the same old Woman supping up a Mess of hot
Pottage, and ran furiously upon her, and threw her Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
in her Face, and offered some other Violence to her.
Whereupon the Neighbours wondering at the condition of
the Boy and his rage against the old Woman, and suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that she had done him some hurt, Apprehended her, and
thereupon she was committed to the Prison, which they
there call the <hi>Checker.</hi> At Night the Boy's Mother Lodged
him in a Garret over her own Lodging; and in the Morning
hearing a great Bussle over her, ran up, and found the Boy
gotten out of his Bed with the Leg of a Form in his hand,
striking furiously at something in the Window; but saw
nothing there that he should strike at. The Boy presently
put on his Cloaths, and ran down into the Street towards
the Prison, and as he was going endeavouring to speak, found
his Speech restored. When he came to the Prison, he asked
for the old Woman, and told the Gaoler how she had ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him, and how his Speech came to him again in the way.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53434:30"/>
The Gaoler in the mean time suspecting that she had Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched
the Boy, would not let her have either Meat or
Drink, unless she would first say the Lord's Prayer, and bid
God bless the Boy; which at last her Hunger forced her to
do; and it appeared to be at the same instant, as near as
could be guessed, that the Boy had his Speech restored to
him. The Boy asked the Gaoler, why he did not keep her
faster, but let her come out and trouble him? The Gaoler
answered, he had kept her very safe. The Boy replied, No,
he had not; for she came and sat in his Chamber Window,
and grinned at him; and that thereupon he took up a Form
Leg, and therewith gave her two good bangs upon the Arse
as she would have scutled from him, before she could get a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
Whereupon the Gaoler caused some Women to Search
her, who found the Marks of two such Strokes upon her,
as the Boy said he had given her. All this was Sworn upon her
Tryal, by the Boy, his Mother, the Gaoler, and the Women.
Upon Examination she was found to be a <hi>Lancashire</hi> Woman,

Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> wandred abroad to get Victuals.</p>

            <p>AT <hi>Teuksbury</hi> about the same time a Man, who had a
<hi>Sow and Pigs,</hi> observing his Sow to have great store
of Milk, and yet the Pigs to be almost Famished, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting
with his Neighbours about it, they all concluded,
that she must needs be Sucked by something else, and so the
<hi>Pigs be robbed of the Milk:</hi> Whereupon he resolved to watch
till he found out the Matter: And having placed himself
conveniently for that purpose, at last he saw a black Four-footed
Creature like a Pole-Cat, come and beat away the
Pigs, and suck the Sow: And having a Pick, or Fork in his
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53434:31"/>
Hand, he ran the Prongs into the Thigh of it, and ran it to
the Ground; yet it struggled so as to get off from him at last.
There were some Neighbours not far off, but they saw no
such Creature, but saw a Wench go away, and that Blood
sell from her as she went; whereupon they searched her, and
found her so Wounded as the Man said he had wounded
the thing which he found Sucking: And thereupon she was
Apprehended and Tryed at <hi>Gloucester</hi> Assizes; where this
Matter was given in Evidence against her.</p>
            <p>These two Relations I received from a Person of Quality, of
good Ability, and of unquestionable Credit, who was present at
both the Tryals, and wrote them in his presence, and afterwards
read them to him; and he assured me they were very true in all the
Particulars, as they were given in Evidence.</p>

            <head>A Relation of the grievous Affliction of Faith Corbet,
by the secret wicked Practices of Alice Huson and
Dol. Bilby, all of the Parish of Burton Agnes in
the County of York, from the Year, 1660, to the
Year, 1664.</head>
            <p>MRs. <hi>Corbet,</hi> Wife of <hi>Henry Corbet,</hi> of <hi>Burton Agnes</hi> in
the County of <hi>York,</hi> about the Year 1660, employed
one <hi>Alice Huson</hi> Widow, of the same Place, about some small
matters, as keeping of young Turkies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For which, she
offered to have paid her in Mony, Corn, or otherwise to her
Satisfaction; but she refused all, and desired only some piece
of old Linen, which her Children wore next their Skin, to
make her a Neckcloth, as she pretended. The Children
hearing of it, intreated their Mother not to give her any
thing that belonged to them, because there went a general
evil Report of her in the Town, and many not only account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her so, but called her Witch. Mrs. <hi>Corbet</hi> reproved
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53434:31"/>
them for saying so, and to give her content, cut an old
Sheet, made her a Neck-cloth, sent for her, and would have
given in her, but she refused it, desiring only something ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining
to the Children, some piece of old Cloth, which
some of them wore next their Skin, if it were but as much
as would make a Stay-band; which was denied her; but she
frequented the House, and had most part of her Relief there,
and Mrs. <hi>Corbet</hi> caused her to be served with Meat and
Drink such as she desired.</p>
            <p>One day as <hi>Alice Huson</hi> was sitting in the Kitchin, her
Daughter <hi>Faith Corbet,</hi> of about Ten or Eleven years of Age,
came in to wash her Hands, where not suspecting any thing, she
pulled off her Gloves, and washing her Hands, when she
had done, went into the House to dry them, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
presently again, but her Gloves were gone, and <hi>Alice
Huson</hi> also. Whereupon, she often complained for the loss
of her Gloves, and said that the Old Witch hod gotten
them, but durst not speak it openly, for fear her Mother
should chide her: And not long after, she fell into <hi>a strange
Fit,</hi> so that two or three could hardly hold her, did often
Screech and Cry out vehemently, sometimes scratch and bite
any she could lay hold on, and say, Ah, <hi>Alice,</hi> Old Witch,
have I gotten thee? And sometimes lye down all drawn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
almost round; and lye still as in a Swoon, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus the most part of a Week: And sometimes again all
of a sudden, she became unusually Merry, and continued so
for a considerable time together.</p>
            <p>In these Fits, many came to visit her, and various were
their Opinions of them, some saying they were Fits of the
Mother; others, that they proceeded from the Mother and
the Spleen; others, that they were Convulsion Fits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And
divers Phisicians were Consulted for her. For, her Father
observing daily and almost hourly the motions and alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of her Distemper, wrote to Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> (who lived at
<hi>York)</hi> and described the same to him as exactly as he could.
The Doctor was very confident he could grapple with any
Disease Curable, except there was Fascination in the case:
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53434:32"/>
But in this his Skill failed; and therefore, when several things
which he thought good for her, had been used, but did her
no good, her Father sent to Dr. <hi>Whitty,</hi> who being then at
<hi>Beverly,</hi> came over to her, staid that Night and the next
Day till after Noon, greatly admiring the manner of her Fits,
and gave her sometimes one thing, and sometimes another,
as he thought convenient for her; but she was little the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Her Distemper still continuing, or rather returning at
times (for she had intervals) her Father upon the 24<hi>th.</hi> of
<hi>March,</hi> 1660, carried her to <hi>Hull</hi> to Dr. <hi>Corbet,</hi> who with
his Wife, (who it seems had some skill in such Distempers)
used their utmost Endeavours, but with little Success. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
she was fetched home; and after some time continuing
ill, she desired to go to her Sisters at <hi>Dalby Daile</hi> in <hi>Picker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Lath,</hi> hoping that the change of the Air and a remote
Place, might conduce to her Health, or Recovery; but about
15 <hi>February,</hi> 1661, she fell extream ill, so that her Father
was sent for, and forced to go to <hi>York</hi> for Advice, tho much
against her mind; for she said, <hi>Doctors nor Physick could do
her no good,</hi> still crying out against <hi>Alice Huson;</hi> and the 9<hi>th</hi>
of <hi>March</hi> he brought her home again. Where her Fits and
Distemper still continuing, and growing more violent, Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
<hi>Taylor</hi> having been several times with her, desired her
Father to send her to <hi>York,</hi> where he would have an eye and
'special care over her. So the 18<hi>th</hi> of—1662, he carried
her thither, where she remained till the 21 of <hi>May,</hi> 1663.
But she still continuing ill, entreated her Father to let her
take no more <hi>Physick;</hi> for nothing would cure her so long as
those too, <hi>Alice Huson</hi> and <hi>Dol. Bilby,</hi> were at Liberty, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
crying out of them. And her Fits at times still grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more violent, she desired once more to see her Sister at
<hi>Dolby,</hi> and the rather because her Sister being with Child,
was near her time of Travel. Whereupon she was sent thither
<hi>4th. March,</hi> 1663. And the 22<hi>d.</hi> as she was lying in Bed
with her Sister, her Sister that Night fell in Travel, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
her to rise and call her Mother; which she going to do,
as she was going out of the Chamber door, a <hi>Black Cat,</hi> as
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53434:32"/>
she said, leaped in her Face, (tho there was no such known
to be in the House) and so affrighted her, that she got into
her Sisters Bed, and clasped such fast hold on her, then in
Travel of Child-birth, that the Women who came in to her
Labour, could scarce get her from her: She still crying out
of <hi>Bilby</hi> and <hi>Huson,</hi> continuing there with her Sister, some
times well, and sometimes ill. Her Father was sent for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
3<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> 1664. Who finding her in a very sad
condition, unknown to her, sent again to Doctor <hi>Taylor</hi> to
<hi>York,</hi> and received Cordials and other Physick from him;
which when she understood, she told him, <q>That if she had
known, he should not have sent, for all the Doctors and
Physick in the World could do her no good, so long as
those two Women were at Liberty; they would have her
Life, and she was contented, since she could not be believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</q>
There she continued most violently handled, so that
her Father was constrained to borrow Sir <hi>Fr. Boynton</hi>'s Coach
to carry her home, 9. <hi>April,</hi> expecting daily and hourly
when she should depart and give up her Life; but especially
the 22<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>April</hi> her Fits seized her in a most strange and
violent manner, for Twenty two Hours together, without the
least intermission; so that every one that saw her, thought it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
she should live one Minute. Her Tongue hung out at
a large extent; her Teeth so hard set fast, that it was feared
she would bite off her Tongue; she lay as Dead, with her
Eyes broad open; Her Arms and Legs and Thighs twisted
and admirably twined together; her Bowels by the report of
Women that came in to see her and sat up with her, so drawn
up together, that one might have laid their Hand upon her
Belly and have felt her Back-bone, and her Spleen taken
quite away, but she had the benefit of Hearing and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing;
so that being asked by those that were about her,
who troubled her? She could answer sometimes <hi>Bilby,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<hi>Huson,</hi> and sometimes both together. She remaining
in this condition, Sir <hi>Francis Boynton</hi> advised her Father to
send for the Doctors; he sent to <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Hull</hi> for Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi>
Dr. <hi>Whitty</hi> and Dr. <hi>Corbet:</hi> But e'er they came, she coming
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53434:33"/>
a little to her self began thus to speak, <hi>Oh Faithless and incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous
People! Shall I never be believed till it be past time?
For I am as near Death as possibly may be; and when they have
got my Life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you will repent when it is past time.</hi> Hereupon her
Father went to Mr. <hi>Wellfet,</hi> Minister of <hi>Burton Agnes,</hi> and
they and others went to speak with <hi>Alice Huson,</hi> and tho at
first they could not prevail with her, yet at last they got her to
his House, and Sir <hi>Fr. Boynton</hi> a Justice of the Peace and Mr.
<hi>Wellfet</hi> being there, after much a do, at last they prevailed with
her to go up into his Daughters Chamber. As she went up,
his Daughter gave a great Screech; and some in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
brought <hi>Alice Huson</hi> to the Bed-side: And after a short
time, she going down again, his Daughter called suddenly
for a Toast and Beer; for (she said) she was very Hungry
and Dry. All were amazed to see so sudden a Change, for
she had not taken any thing in three days before, and was so
weak, that she desired always those who were with her, to
turn her in her Bed. Having taken her Toast and Beer, she
said, if they would give her some of her Cordials, she could
take them, which before she could not; and having taken
a good quantity, she desired, to the admiration of all who saw
her before, to have her Cloaths, and she got up and told
them how she had been handled by the two Women. She
continued well all <hi>Saturday</hi> Night, and <hi>Sunday</hi> Morning 24th.
of <hi>April,</hi> all the Doctors met and consulted about her Case;
and coming to her spake comfortably to her, and told her
how they had consulted for her good. She answered, and
said, <hi>I thank you Gentlemen, for your Pains, Care and good
Will: But if my Father would have been perswaded by me, he
should not have sent for you: For I know, that so long as those
two women are at Liberty, neither you nor any other, or any
thing you can administer, will do me any good: But I must to
give my Father and you satisfaction, take such as you give me.</hi>
Thus she continued in a good State (saith her Father) till
after Dinner I went up, and staid till Church time, and then
left her as I supposed in a good condition. When I came to
the Door, to go to Church, <hi>Doll. Bilby</hi> (who as we supposed
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53434:33"/>
had been with <hi>Alice Huson)</hi> came by, whereupon I staid still,
and let her pass by, observing her Gesture; and when she
came against the Window of the Chamber where my Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
lay, she turned about, and looked up at the Window;
and immediately my Daughter cried out, she is there; and
giving a great Screek, fell again into her Fits, crying out,
her Heart was quite gone. On <hi>Monday</hi> 25 of <hi>April, Bilby</hi>
came again to Town, (She lived at <hi>Thorne Hotime,</hi> which
is in the same Parish of <hi>Burton Agnes)</hi> and had Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
with <hi>Huson,</hi> as <hi>Huson</hi> confessed. But my Daughter
fell so ill again, continually blaming them, and saying they
had too much Liberty, that that Night I got them Secured,
the 26<hi>th</hi> Examined, the 27<hi>th,</hi> Searched, the 28<hi>th,</hi> Re-exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
and <hi>Alice Huson</hi> Confessed; and the 29<hi>th, Bilby</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
again, upon <hi>Huson</hi>'s Confession, and both sent to
the Gaol. But this is to be observed, that tho my Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was well (just) before, yet upon their Examination and
Searching, and during all that time, she was most cruelly
handled and tormented, and as soon as they were Carted,
she Recovered, (and) continued so till <hi>Saturday 14th.</hi> of <hi>May,</hi>
when she fell suddenly into her old Fits, affirming that <hi>Bilby</hi>
had got Pins and Needles, wherewith she Tormented her, and
had too much Liberty. On <hi>Monday</hi> Morning I went to <hi>York,</hi>
and found it was as she said, and Mr. <hi>Read</hi> the Keeper, said,
she should be soon held and restrained of her Liberty; and
said, observe the time of the Day; it is upon the point of
Two; and said as soon as you are out of the Castle-Gate, all
shall be done, therefore let me hear how your Daughter
doth. Coming home, I found my Daughter (blessed be God)
in good Health. I enquired what time she Recovered?
they said, upon the point of Two she called for her Cloaths,
and said she would Rise, for she was sure her Father had
been at the Castle, and gotten her Business done.</p>

            <head>The Confession of Alice Huson, 28 of April, 1664.
to Mr. Tim. Wellfet, Vicar of Burton Agnes, (in
her own Words) as it was given in to the Judges at
York Assizes,</head>
            <p>THree Years I have had to do with, and for the Devil:
He appeared to me like a <hi>Black Man</hi> on a Horse upon
the Moor: He told me I should never want, if I would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
his ways: He bid me to give my self to him, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
the Lord; and I promised him I would. He did upon
that give me five Shillings; and another time he gave me
seven Shillings: And for six several times he did so; and
<hi>Thom. Ratle</hi> had 20 <hi>s.</hi> of the Mony I had of him. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
like a <hi>Black Man</hi> upon a Black Horse, with Cloven-Feet;
and then I fell down, and did Worship him upon my
Knees, because I promised him I would do so. I have hurt
Mrs. <hi>Faith Corbet</hi> by my Evil Spirit: I did, in my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension,
ride her: And when I was Examined by Mr. <hi>Wellfet</hi>
our Minister, the Devil stood by, and gave me my Answer.
I was under the Window like a Cat, when Mrs. <hi>Corbet</hi> said
I was; and <hi>Doll Bilby</hi> had a hand in this Tormenting Mrs.
<hi>Corbet: Doll Bilby</hi> said, let us make an End of her; and I
said it was pity to take away her Life, for we had done her
overmuch hurt already. The Devil did appear to me and
<hi>Doll Bilby</hi> both together: <hi>Doll Bilby</hi> had of the Devil on
<hi>Thursday</hi> or <hi>Friday,</hi> some Mony: I had about a Fortnight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
ten Shillings of the Devil at <hi>Ratle</hi>'s door about Twi-light
or Day-gate; and I gave two Shillings of this Mony for two
Pecks of Barly, Pease and Wheat mix'd, to <hi>Will. Parkley:</hi>
He told me, if I would kill Mrs. <hi>Alice Corbet,</hi> I should never
Want: He twitches me at the Heart, as if it were drawn
together with Pincers. I have, I confess, a Witch-pap, which
is Sucked by the Unclean Spirit: This Sucking lasteth from
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53434:34"/>
Supper-time, till after Cock-crowing. The Devil did bid me
deny to Mr. <hi>Wellfet</hi> that he was sent by me. I had a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to practice Witchcraft when I begg'd a piece of Cloth
and Black-hood. I confess that I did by this Evil Spirit, kill
<hi>Dick Warren;</hi> which was done by my wicked Heart and
wicked Eyes: If I had not employ'd this wicked Spirit, I
had not hurt him. I lent <hi>Lancelot Harrison</hi> eight Shillings
of the ten Shillings the Devil gave me. I did forsake God,
because I promised the Devil to serve him. The Devil bid
me not to tell of <hi>Doll Bilby.</hi>

            <p>A <hi>Trumpeter,</hi> who had served the Prince in his Wars, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his return from the War, finding many Executed
for Witchcraft in that Country, absented
himself,<note place="margin">Neither the Country, nor the Time is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Letter.</note> and hid himself. He being miss'd,
and they knowing no reason for his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sconding,
enquiry was made after him, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
he might hav been guilty of some evil Action or other,
Theft, or Adultery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But found nothing against him.
However, they continued their Enquiry, till at last they found
where he was, and told him he must go to the Prince.
Whereupon he cried out, I am a Dead Man. And being
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53434:35"/>
asked, what was the matter? He said he was a Witch, and
must Die. To the Prince he was brought; before whom
(to the amazement of him and all Men, for none suspected
him in the least) he confessed, that one day walking in the
Wood, he had met in a By Walk, a very handsom Woman,
with whom entring into Discourse, he endeavoured to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
her to submit to his Will, which at last she yielded
to; and when he had satisfied himself with her, she Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
her self into a hideous Shape, and told him, Now
he was from that time forward his; but made him many
Promises, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He being thus Engaged, said he had a Wife,
and wished her in the same Condition. This Caco-Daemon
replied, he should take no care for that matter; he would
effect it, and thus; He should pretend a necessity of going
from Home all of a sudden, and tell his Wife that there
would come to find him a Gentleman, a good Friend of his
in the War; and that he was sorry he could not stay to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him as he would, desiring her, if he came before he
returned, to make as much of him as she could possible, as
being his singular Friend. He being gone, this pretended
Gentleman some time after, came in very good Equipage,
attended with a Servant, enquired for her Husband, seemed
sorry for his Absence: But she doing her Errand as her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
had ordered her, and shewing him great Kindness, he
propounded to her the having his Will upon her; and she
consenting, he enjoyed her not only, but her Daughter (also)
of about Eleven, or twelve Years Old, to whom then he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
as to her Husband: And then her Husband returned
and found it so.</p>
            <p>From that time forward, certain power to hurt Cattle (as
I remember) only was imparted to them: And the Man
was continually accosted and compelled to continue his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
with his <hi>Succuba,</hi> and the Woman and her Daughter
with their <hi>Incubus;</hi> with whom the first Commerce was
strangely Delightful, but ever after cold and painful to
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:53434:35"/>
These things having Confess'd, and being very penitent, they
desired to die, and were accordingly Executed: But because
they had not hurt Mankind, and were so Penitent, instead
of being Burn'd, they were Beheaded.</p>
            <p>The Prince would fain have saved the Girl, because of
her Youth, and used all Endeavours to deliver her from the
Spirit, but could not effect it; the Girl crying out several
times that he now was committing Uncleanness with her;
crying out and desiring rather to die than to live so, and be
subject to that foul Spirit any longer, and accordingly was
Executed as her Father and Mother were.</p>

of the 12 of Febbruary, 1690. S. V.</head>
            <p>WE have here a strange Case of a Youth about Fifteen
Years old, that has been of a quiet and orderly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
and was bred up to Reading and Praying, who is
Possessed, and as the Spirit it self says through him, is actua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by three of them, who were sent to him by three divers
Witches, which he publickly named.</p>
            <p>I my self have entred the Lists with the Ghost, who at
last, tho very unwillingly, Answered, and speaks as good
High <hi>Dutch</hi> as is spoken in <hi>Austria,</hi> which the Lad could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
speak. I was very sharp in my Assault, and he as stre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously
opposed. When he departs, it is with a great Noise,
and the Lad lyes a good while as in a deep Swoon, till reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
by application of fit Remedies, and then he prays de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly,
which while Possessed, he cannot do; and when the
Spirits forsake him in part, which sometimes they do for a
whole, sometimes for half a day; he works at his ordinary
Labour, which is, Weaving Linen, that being the Trade he
is Learning. He is of a Meek Spirit; but in his Fits, three
Men have enough to hold him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:53434:36"/>
The Spirit says very confidently, that he has leave from
the Old Man in Heaven (Thus he calls <hi>God,</hi> and will not
easily be brought to use that word) not to leave the Lad till
the Witches have received their Punishments; and that he was
compelled by that Old Man in Heaven to discover the Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
and their wicked Works; all which he has done, and upon
it, the Inquest was made, which otherwise no body would
have thought of.</p>
            <p>In fine, it is so strange and incomprehensible a thing, that
'tis not to be expressed, insomuch, that if I had not been an

At the Second, he grew very impatient, Gnashing with
his Teeth, and would not name the name of <hi>Christ,</hi> till
I constrained him as before, and alledged the Example
of the Devil in the Gospel, that had spoke concerning
Christ.</p>
               <p>I Then proceeded to the Third, Whereupon he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
an Order amongst them, but would not confess of
what Order himself was, but said, <hi>Thou askest more than is
needful for thee to know.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I replied,</hi> But thou knowest well enough, that I know full
well what pitiful things you Spirits are without God's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He.</hi> I know it, or else thou would'st forbear to vex me
thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I.</hi> How comest thou to be such a silly Devil, that thou canst
speak nothing but High Dutch?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He.</hi> Are you Men then all of the same Capacity?</p>
               <p>I passed then to the former things, and spake to him of the
<hi>Blood of Christ,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He.</hi> I'll be gone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I.</hi> No, thou shalt first answer me to this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He answered,</hi> I know Christ has redeemed Men, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we can do nothing to you without Permission: <hi>And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
divers times,</hi> I'll be gone.</p>
               <p>At last I said, <hi>Go then and be Hanged.</hi> And immediately
he went forth with a great Outcry; whereupon the poor
Lad being come as out of an Extasie, after divers applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
returned to himself again.</p>
               <p>I asked the Devils <hi>their Names;</hi> he said his Name was
<hi>Pretty Betty;</hi> the other was call'd <hi>Longtale,</hi> and the third,
<hi>Cuckow:</hi> and these three possessed the Lad, whereof two
go forth, but one of them keeps always possession of the
Body.</p>

The next day, being the day of the Circumcision of <hi>Christ,</hi>
I went on where I left off the day before, and so came,</p>
               <p>To the Fourth, Of the Holy Ghost, which he resisted
hard, but at last owned all that I demanded on that head;
but within half an hour would be gone: But I would not
let him go according to his will, till he had answered me
fully; and then he went away, as the day before.</p>
               <p>If we interrogate the Devil too profoundly, or too curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
he answers, <hi>Thou askest more than is fit for thee to know,
or permitted to me to say.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Three German Miles from hence, dwells one Mr. <hi>Crom,</hi>
whose little Daughter of about Twelve Years Old, is in like
manner possessed; out of whom the Devil speaks all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Languages imaginable.</p>
