            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>We are now Assembled with all possible <hi>Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi> to acknowledge his <hi>Mercy,</hi> in the Gracious <hi>Return</hi> which he has vouchsafed to make to these our <hi>Requests.</hi> That He has <hi>Preserved</hi> our <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper'd</hi> his <hi>Enterprizes;</hi> and given a Success to our <hi>Arms,</hi> if not equal to what perhaps <hi>some</hi> would have <hi>wish'd,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:60636:3"/>
yet I am sure beyond what <hi>any of us</hi> could <hi>reasonably</hi> have <hi>expected.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this being the Design of this <hi>days Solemnity,</hi> I cannot tell how I could better entertain your <hi>Devotion</hi> than in offering you some Reflections upon the <hi>Words</hi> before us. In which we have the <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> and <hi>Prayer</hi> of a <hi>King:</hi> A <hi>Gratulatory Acknowledgment</hi> of <hi>God's Mercy</hi> to Him in his <hi>past Deliverances,</hi> and an earnest <hi>Request</hi> that He would still continue to deliver him both from the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Malice</hi> of his <hi>false</hi> and <hi>treacherous Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this <hi>Psalm</hi> was composed by <hi>King David</hi> the <note n="†" place="margin">A Psalm of <hi>David.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Inscription</hi> of it will not suffer us to doubt. And that he composed it upon the account of some great <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance</hi> which God had given him, from a <hi>Personal danger,</hi> as well as for some Great <hi>Victory</hi> which He had obtain'd against his <hi>Enemies,</hi> the words of the <hi>Text</hi> sufficiently demonstrate.</p>
            <p>But now what that <hi>Deliverance</hi> in <hi>particular</hi> was which he here acknowledges with so much <hi>Gratitude,</hi> and promises God He would ever celebrate with the most pious Resentments, and in the most solemn manner that He was able, we are no where told; nor is it perhaps an easy matter to determine any thing certainly concerning it.</p>
            <p>Indeed were the <hi>Title</hi> which the <hi>Septuagint</hi> prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix to this <hi>Psalm,</hi> of such <hi>Authority,</hi> that we might securely rely upon the Credit of it, we should then soon come to a Resolution of this Point.

               </note> 
               <hi>Chaldee Paraphrast</hi> on the <hi>Text</hi> tells us he here <hi>blesses God</hi> for delivering of Him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:60636:3"/>
But as 'tis certain that this <hi>Inscription</hi> is not now to be found in any of the <hi>Hebrew Copies</hi> at this Day, so <note n="†" place="margin">Tom <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>in Psal. 143.</note> 
               <hi>Theodoret</hi> assures us that neither could He in his time meet with it in any. And the expressions of this <hi>Psalm</hi> both in the <hi>2d</hi> and <hi>10th</hi> Verses, plainly shew that when he composed it he was not only <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> but <hi>throughly Established in the Throne.</hi> For so those Words must be understood <hi>V. 2. Blessed</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Compare this with Psal. 18. 2. 47. 2 Sam. 22. 3. 48.</note> 
               <hi>be the Lord my strength who teacheth my Hands to War and my fingers to fight: My Goodness and my Fortress, my High Tower and my Deliverer, my sheild, and He in whom I trust, who subdueth my People under me:</hi> i. e. Who after all the <hi>Contests</hi> that have been raised <hi>against me</hi> to <hi>oppose</hi> my <hi>Authority,</hi> has at last fully establish'd me in the <hi>Throne,</hi> and brought <hi>All Israel</hi> to submit themselves unto Me.</p>
            <p>Now this has made Others suppose that the <hi>Sword</hi> 
               <note place="margin">So R. Kimchi in loc.</note> from which <hi>God</hi> had <hi>delivered David,</hi> and for which he here offers this <hi>Eucharistical return</hi> to Him, was the <hi>Sword</hi> of <hi>Saul,</hi> who so eagerly sought after his Life; and from whose hand he could never have escaped, had not the same <hi>Providence</hi> which before <hi>design'd</hi> him for the <hi>Throne,</hi> in a wonderful manner <hi>preserved</hi> him for it, and at last <hi>confirm'd</hi> him in it.</p>
            <p>It cannot be deny'd but that this is a <hi>Conjecture</hi> agreeable enough to one part at least of the business of this <hi>Psalm,</hi> which was to <hi>return Thanks</hi> to <hi>God</hi> for putting an End to those <hi>Oppositions</hi> that had been raised against him by the <hi>Friends</hi> of the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Saul;</hi> and bringing all <hi>Israel</hi> to receive him as their <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But tho' I shall not therefore exclude this from being a Part of what the <hi>Psalmist</hi> here intended to <hi>Bless God</hi> for, yet I cannot think that this comes up
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60636:4"/>
to the full meaning of the <hi>Words</hi> of the <hi>Text.</hi> For if we look more narrowly into the <hi>Expressions</hi> of it, we shall find good grounds to believe that <hi>David</hi> not only composed this <hi>Psalm</hi> after he was come to the <hi>Crown,</hi> but do's more especially refer to some <hi>Deliverance</hi> which he had received after his Coming to it; and by consequence after all his <hi>Dangers</hi> from the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Saul</hi> were at an End. For having first <hi>vow'd</hi> a <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> Vs. 9. <hi>I will sing a new Song unto thee O God: upon a Psaltery and Instrument of Ten strings will I sing Praises unto thee.</hi> He tells us Vs. 10. That the subject of his <hi>Hymn</hi> should be this, <hi>It is he that giveth Salvation unto KINGS, that has deliver'd David his servant from the Hurtful Sword:</hi> i. e. as the <hi>Connexion</hi> plainly shews, when he was a <hi>King;</hi> and as such received <hi>Salvation</hi> from Him.</p>
            <p>In short, As the <hi>Passage</hi> I have now mentioned does I think plainly enough argue that this <hi>Psalm</hi> was a <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> for some <hi>Deliverance</hi> which God had vouchsafed to him since he was <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Israel;</hi> so we may reasonably conclude from the <hi>Acknowledgment</hi> 
               <note place="margin">V. 12.</note> which he makes in the <hi>Beginning</hi> of it, of his being at last <hi>Peaceably Settled</hi> in the <hi>Throne,</hi> as a Blessing which He had but newly received of Him, that it was a <hi>Deliverance</hi> from some <hi>Danger</hi> which befell him not long after his solemn <hi>Inauguration</hi> at <hi>Hebron, 2 Sam.</hi> V. And the <hi>Character</hi> which he gives us of his <hi>Enemies</hi> in two places of this <hi>Psalm,</hi> that They were <hi>Strange</hi> 
               <note place="margin">V. 7. 8. 11. Compare Deut. 32. 21. 2 Kings 17. 15. Jer. 2. 5. &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>Children, whose mouth did speak Vanity; and their Right hand was a Right hand of falshood,</hi> farther shews that They were some of the <hi>Idolatrous Nations</hi> round about Him that rose up against Him, and put him in that <hi>Hazard</hi> out of which <hi>God</hi> had in a singular Manner <hi>delivered</hi> Him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:60636:4"/>
Now this will lead us to a very probable Account of the <hi>Occasion</hi> and <hi>Design</hi> of the <hi>Psalm</hi> before Us. For in the second of <hi>Sam.</hi> V. 17. we read that no sooner had the <hi>Philistines heard that they had anointed David King over Israel,</hi> but they immediately <hi>Armed</hi> themselves against Him, in Hopes that whilst He was yet scarce <hi>well setled</hi> in his <hi>Government</hi> they might be able to deal with Him; least if they tarried till mens <hi>Affections</hi> were wholly <hi>engaged</hi> to <hi>Him,</hi> He should then Grow too <hi>Strong</hi> for them.</p>
            <p>But God who had in so <hi>wonderful</hi> a <hi>manner brought</hi> him to the <hi>Throne,</hi> now no less <hi>miraculously pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served</hi> him in it. He went forth Himself into the <hi>Battle to smite the Host of the Philistines;</hi> He di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected <note place="margin">2 Sam. V.—23.—24.—20.—25.</note> Him both <hi>when</hi> and <hi>How</hi> to fall upon Them. And having thus discomfited them in <hi>two Battles;</hi> and tho' not <hi>utterly destroy'd</hi> them, yet obtained a <hi>Considerable Advantage</hi> against Them; He composed this <hi>Psalm,</hi> as a Solemn <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> and <hi>Prayer</hi> to <hi>God Almighty;</hi> both to <hi>Bless</hi> him for that <hi>Success</hi> he had already obtain'd, and to implore his Favour in the <hi>utter Subversion</hi> of these his <hi>Treacherous</hi> and <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have before observed that this <hi>Psalm</hi> consists of <hi>two principal Parts;</hi> viz. 1st. A <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> for that Great <hi>Deliverance</hi> which God had already given him out of the hands of the <hi>Philistines:</hi> And 2ly. A <hi>Prayer</hi> for the Continuance of his <hi>Favour</hi> and <hi>Protection;</hi> that He would still go on to save him from his <hi>Enemies,</hi> and to bless his <hi>Government</hi> with <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Prosperity:</hi> And my <hi>Text</hi> leads Me to consider both of them;</p>
            <p>I<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. The THANKSGIVING, Vss. 9. 10. <hi>I will sing a new Song unto Thee O God!</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:60636:5"/>
               <hi>II<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>. The</hi> PRAYER, <hi>Vs.</hi> 11. Rid me and deliver me from the hand of strange Children, whose Mouth talketh Vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falshood.</p>
            <p>I begin with the former of these:</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Thanksgiving,</hi> which <hi>David</hi> here made to <hi>God Almighty</hi> for <hi>preserving</hi> him from the <hi>Sword</hi> of his <hi>Enemies,</hi> and for the <hi>Good Success</hi> he had met with in his <hi>Enterprizes</hi> against Them.</p>
            <p>It was a Part of that <hi>Religion</hi> which the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> taught the very <hi>Gentiles</hi> themselves, as to <note place="margin">See Dionys. Hal. l. vi. p. 411. Et supr. l. ii. p. 90.</note> 
               <hi>implore</hi> the <hi>help</hi> of their <hi>Gods</hi> in times of <hi>Danger</hi> and <hi>Distress;</hi> so to make their Solemn returns of <hi>Praise</hi> and <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> to them, as often as they escaped with Safety out of it. The same <hi>Reason</hi> which forced them to acknowledge the <hi>Being</hi> of a <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> carrying them on to confess the Interest he had in the <hi>Government</hi> of it: And that it was to his <hi>Providence</hi> therefore they ought both to <hi>recommend</hi> Themselves in All their <hi>Affairs,</hi> and to <hi>render</hi> the <hi>Praise</hi> of whatsoever <hi>Success</hi> they met with in them.</p>

            <p>And indeed if to be <hi>Insensible</hi> of the <hi>Favours</hi> which one of our <hi>Fellow-Creatures</hi> bestows upon us, has ever been Esteem'd enough to fix one of the <hi>blackest Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi> (for so we all of us account that of <hi>Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi> to be) upon such a One: How much more both <hi>Wicked</hi> and <hi>Ungrateful</hi> must he be judged who neglects his God, and takes no notice of those <hi>Blessings</hi> which his bountiful <hi>Providence</hi> showers down upon Him?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:60636:6"/>
But there is yet much more to be consider'd by Us as to this Matter: For not only our <hi>Piety</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>God,</hi> and that <hi>grateful Sense</hi> we ought to have of his <hi>Mercies</hi> to us, oblige us thus to <hi>return</hi> our <hi>Thanks</hi> for them; but our very <hi>Interest</hi> too concurs to engage us to it.</p>
            <p>He who neglects to <hi>acknowledge</hi> the <hi>Kindness</hi> of One of his <hi>Fellow-Creatures,</hi> and thereby forfeits all Pretence to any <hi>farther Favours</hi> from Him; runs only the Hazard of being <hi>deprived</hi> of that <hi>little Help</hi> which such a One might otherwise have afforded Him some Other Time, and of which perhaps He may never find any great Want. To be sure the most we can suppose he could lose by it, would be to become thereby Exposed to the <hi>Resentments</hi> of a <hi>Man</hi> whom he needs not much fear, and against Whom he may find out many ways to defend Himself.</p>
            <p>But it is not so with relation to <hi>God-Almighty:</hi> His <hi>Providence</hi> is always over us, and we cannot <hi>subsist</hi> the least <hi>Moment</hi> of <hi>our Lives</hi> without it. <hi>In</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Acts xvii. 28.</note> 
               <hi>him we live, and move, and have our Being.</hi> The very <hi>Breath</hi> that we <hi>draw</hi> in, the <hi>World</hi> in which we <hi>dwell,</hi> Our <hi>Health</hi> and <hi>Strength,</hi> Our <hi>Food</hi> and <note place="margin">Psal. civ. 28, 29, 30.</note>

And should we by our <hi>Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi> provoke Him to withdraw His Favour from us, we should then become <hi>Destitute</hi> indeed, for ever lost to all the <hi>Hopes</hi> both of <hi>this World</hi> and of the <hi>Other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the <hi>only Acknowledgment</hi> we can make to God for all his <hi>Mercies</hi> to us, is this of <hi>Praise</hi> and <hi>Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving.</hi> He is above receiving any Other Returns from Us. Whasotever we have besides, it is all of

            <p>Such then was the <hi>Justice</hi> and Reasonableness of that <hi>Acknowledgment</hi> which the <hi>Royal Psalmist</hi> here engaged himself to make to <hi>God Almighty,</hi> for deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering Him out of those <hi>imminent Dangers</hi> to which He had been Exposed. <hi>I will sing a New-song unto Thee O God! upon a Psaltry and Instrument of ten strings Will I sing Praises unto Thee.</hi> And it is supposed by some that the very next <hi>Psalm</hi> to this, was that <hi>Hymn</hi> which he composed in pursuance of this <hi>Vow:</hi> And in which with all the <hi>heighth</hi> of <hi>Poetry,</hi> and in the most <hi>exquisite Form</hi> that <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> joyn'd together and assisting one another could produce; He sets forth the <hi>Glorious Goodness</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> to the Whole <hi>World,</hi> but especially to <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;</hi> and among them more particularly to such as duly <hi>serve</hi> him, and put their <hi>Trust</hi> and <hi>Confidence</hi> in his <hi>Mercy.</hi> And in conformity to whose <hi>Example</hi> it will behove every One of us this <hi>day</hi> to lift up our <hi>Hearts</hi> to <hi>Heaven</hi> in <hi>Songs of Praise</hi> to that <hi>God,</hi> who has now again in our <hi>Case,</hi> as He did heretofore in <hi>Davids,</hi> in so extraordinary a manner made Good the <hi>Character</hi> of the <hi>Text</hi> to us; <hi>It is He that Giveth Salvation unto Kings, that hath delivered David his Servant from the hurtful Sword.</hi>

But of our own concern in this <hi>Duty,</hi> I shall take Occasion to speak more particularly hereafter.

               </gap> out of all these <hi>Difficulties</hi> God deliver'd him; and were it necessary for me to go on to the <hi>following parts</hi> of his <hi>Life,</hi> we might find yet greater <hi>Instances</hi> than these of his Wonderful <hi>Preservations</hi> of him. And as 'tis certain that no One ever took more Care to <hi>magnify</hi> the <hi>Mercies</hi> of God, than <hi>David</hi> did; So I may say that never had any <hi>Prince</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:60636:9"/>
greater reason than He had so to do: Who seems to have been <hi>chosen</hi> by God out of all the <hi>Kings</hi> of the World, to shew what a tender regard the <hi>Almighty</hi> has to his own <hi>Ministers,</hi> whilst they take care to <hi>live well,</hi> and to <hi>demean</hi> themselves as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes that <hi>Place,</hi> and <hi>Character</hi> which he has bestow'd upon Them.</p>
            <p>This then was the <hi>Case</hi> of the <hi>Royal Psalmist,</hi> when he resolved upon that <hi>Song</hi> of <hi>Eucharist,</hi> of which the <hi>Text</hi> speaks, in acknowledgment of all those <hi>Blessings</hi> which God had Vouchsafed to Him. And if we Enquire into the <hi>Reason</hi> of all this, What it was that moved God to shew such a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular regard to this <hi>Great Man;</hi> I think we may give these two Accounts of it.</p>
            <p>1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. That He was <hi>King</hi> of Gods own <hi>peculiar People;</hi> that <hi>People</hi> which he had chosen out of all <note place="margin">Psal. 135. 4. Deutr. iv. 7, 8, 32, &amp;c. 2 Sam. vii. 23.</note> the Inhabitants of the Earth to be his <hi>own Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> To whom alone of all the <hi>Nations</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> he had <hi>Declared</hi> his <hi>Will,</hi> and given many <hi>noble Discoveries</hi> of himself; whilst the rest of Mankind lay in a miserable State of <hi>Darkness</hi> and <hi>Idolatry:</hi> And of whom therefore he took a <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Care,</hi> more than of any Other <hi>People</hi> or <hi>Country</hi> besides.</p>
            <p>Now if God had an <hi>especial regard</hi> to the <hi>Jewish Nation</hi> more than to <hi>any Other;</hi> If he kept as it <note place="margin">Exod. xxv. 8. Jer. vii. 12. Ezek. xxxvii. 26.</note> were his <hi>peculiar Residence</hi> among them, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a more than ordinary <hi>Communication</hi> in all other respects with them: It ought not to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, If we find him in a singular manner <hi>watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> over their <hi>King</hi> too, more than over those of any Other <hi>People</hi> or <hi>Nation</hi> besides, and in an
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60636:9"/>
extraordinary manner careful to <hi>save</hi> and <hi>desend</hi> Him.</p>
            <p>But this is not yet All: For if we look into the <hi>History</hi> of the <hi>Holy David,</hi> we shall find that God did not only favour Him more than any <hi>King</hi> of all the <hi>Nations</hi> round about Him, but more than any other <hi>King,</hi> even of <hi>Israel</hi> its self. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I add</p>
            <p>2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>. That this Great Man was not only <hi>King</hi> of <hi>God's own peculiar People,</hi> and as such the <hi>Guardian</hi> of his <hi>Laws,</hi> and <hi>Supporter</hi> of his <hi>Worship:</hi> But he was moreover Himself a most <hi>excellent Person</hi> too, A <hi>Man after God's own Heart;</hi> and by his <hi>own</hi>

               <hi>Piety,</hi> no less than by his <hi>place</hi> and <hi>Character</hi> in a more particular manner intituled to the <hi>Divine Care</hi> and <hi>Protection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is what I take to be implied in that <hi>Expression</hi> of the <hi>Text</hi> where He calls himself <hi>God's Servant; It is He that giveth Salvation unto</hi> Kings, <hi>who delivereth</hi> David <hi>his</hi> Servant <hi>from the Hurtful Sword.</hi>

            <p>And if we look into all the following <hi>Reigns</hi> we shall find, that according as any of his <hi>Successors</hi> shew'd themselves either <note n="‖" place="margin">1 Kings xv. 4. 2 Kings x. 30. 2 Chron xv. xvii. 5. xx. 37. xxvi. 5. xxvii. 6.</note> careful for <hi>Gods Service,</hi> or <note n="*" place="margin">1 Sam. ii. 30. 1 Kings xi. 11, 31, 33. xiv. 9, 10. xv. 29. xvi. 12, 13, 19. xvii. 18. xxi. 10. 2 Chron. xii. 5, 6, &amp;c. xxv. 14, 15.</note>

            <p>Whilst <hi>Solomon</hi> continu'd to walk in the Steps <note place="margin">See 1 Kings c. x.</note> of his <hi>Father David,</hi> never was any <hi>Prince</hi> more <hi>Great</hi> or <hi>Honourable</hi> than He was.

            <p>On the other side we are told of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 Kings xviii. 5. <hi>That after Him was none like Him of all the</hi> Kings <hi>of</hi> Judah, <hi>nor any that were before Him.

            </p>
            <p>It were an Easie matter to add many more <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples</hi> in proof of this Remark, were it at all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to insist upon it.

Indeed there are Certain Seasons when God suffers the <hi>Best Princes</hi> not only to fall into some <note place="margin">Hosea x. 3. &amp; xiii. 11.</note> lesser <hi>Dangers,</hi> but it may be utterly to be cut off by <hi>Wicked</hi> and <hi>Violent Hands.</hi> When the <hi>Sins</hi> of a <hi>Nation</hi> are come to their full Period, So that all the <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Prudence</hi> of their <hi>Governours</hi> are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther able to <hi>reclaim</hi> them from their <hi>Evil ways,</hi>

            <p>And so on the Other hand, There is a time when the <hi>Worst Princes</hi> are strangely preserved; tho' <note place="margin">Jer. xxv. 12.

            <p>But otherwise, I believe it will generally be found true, that the more Careful any <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Prince</hi> is to <hi>live well,</hi> and <hi>govern justly,</hi> and do what in Him lies to <hi>propagate</hi> a true Sense of <hi>Piety</hi> among his <hi>People,</hi> the Happier He proves; and is the more <hi>Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently preserved</hi> by God, as he is certainly the more <hi>dearly Beloved</hi> by Him.</p>
            <p>And good reason there is why God should observe this <hi>Method</hi> with them: For</p>
            <p>[1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>.] This, if any thing, will lay the <hi>Strongest Obligations</hi> upon such <hi>Persons</hi> to be Very careful to support the <hi>Honour</hi> of God, and the <hi>Credit</hi> of <hi>Religion:</hi> When once they shall perceive that their <hi>Welfare</hi> in this <hi>present World,</hi> as well as their <hi>final Happiness</hi> in the <hi>Other,</hi> depends upon it.</p>
            <p>And I need not tell you what a mighty <hi>Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage</hi> this must needs bring to <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Piety;</hi> To find not only a <hi>Refuge</hi> in the <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Princes,</hi>

            <p>Whatsoever <hi>Reward</hi> therefore God shall please to give to such an One <hi>as a King,</hi> it must be all in this <hi>present Life.</hi> Now tho' I will not deny, but that those who employ their <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> which

               <hi>War</hi> against him, immediately upon his being <hi>Anointed King</hi> in <hi>Hebron.</hi> Now tho' by the Blessing of God he had already obtain'd two considerable <hi>Victories</hi> over them, whereby he was for the present at Ease from them: Yet he knew, that by the assistance which the <note place="margin">See Jos. Ant. l. v. 1 cap 4.</note> 
               <hi>Neighbouring Countries</hi> were all ready to lend to them, they would again be in a Condition in a little while to make Head against him; and he doubted not but that as soon as ever they were able, they would be <hi>Treacherous</hi> enough to do it.</p>
            <p>And it was upon this <hi>Apprehension,</hi> that having first given <hi>Thanks</hi> to God for his <hi>present Deliverance,</hi> he in the next place subjoyn'd his earnest <hi>Request</hi> to him, that he would in like manner <hi>preserve</hi> him from their <hi>Attempts</hi> for the time to come. And how necessary such a <hi>Prayer</hi> was, the Event shew'd. For it was not very long before he was again engaged with them: And then God <note place="margin">2 Sam. viii. 1, &amp;c xxi 15 &amp;c.

He utterly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled them from giving any farther Trouble to Him.</p>
            <p>But I insist too long upon the Consideration of these <hi>Words</hi> as they lie before me in this <hi>Psalm:</hi> And the <hi>Solemnity</hi> of this <hi>Day</hi> calls me off to another <hi>Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:60636:13"/>
of them. And tho' I doubt not but you have in a great Measure prevented Me in your <hi>Reflections</hi> upon the foregoing <hi>Parts</hi> of this <hi>Discourse;</hi> yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conclude without pointing out to you somewhat more plainly, how great an Interest we have in the <hi>Subject</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>And I<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. As to what concerns the <hi>Eucharistical part</hi> of the <hi>Text,</hi> never had any <hi>People</hi> greater Reason to joyn with <hi>Holy David</hi> in his <hi>Thanksgiving to God,</hi> than <hi>We</hi> of this <hi>Nation</hi> at this <hi>Time</hi> have.</p>
            <p>For indeed, when did God ever more eminently shew himself to be the <hi>Saviour of Kings,</hi> than in those <hi>frequent</hi> and <hi>signal Deliverances</hi> which he has afforded to our own <hi>Royal Soveraign</hi> from the <hi>Hurtful Sword?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If (1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>) We consider his <hi>Personal Deliverances;</hi> I may venture to affirm, That never did any <hi>Prince</hi> more generously expose himself for any <hi>People,</hi> than his <hi>Majesty</hi> in these late Years has done for Us; nor I think ever did any more narrowly escape with Safety out of them.</p>
            <p>For not to say any thing of the <hi>Common Hazards</hi> of <hi>War;</hi> tho' perhaps no <hi>Prince</hi> either undertook more <hi>Expeditions,</hi> or <hi>carried</hi> them on with greater <hi>Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,</hi> or appeard in them with more <hi>Courage;</hi> or <hi>Ended</hi> them with better <hi>Success;</hi> or less <hi>consider'd</hi> His own <hi>Safety,</hi> in comparison of the <hi>publick Good,</hi> than our <hi>Royal Master</hi> has done, since the time of Him of whom our <hi>Text</hi> speaks.

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60636:13"/>
               <hi>Life,</hi> and in that to all our <hi>Hopes.</hi> But that God who raised him up to <hi>assert</hi> his <hi>Cause,</hi> and to vindicate the <hi>Liberty</hi> not of this <hi>Country</hi> only, but of all <hi>Europe,</hi> from the <hi>Rage</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of its <hi>Common Enemy</hi> and <hi>Oppressor,</hi> had yet more <hi>Victories</hi> for him to obtain. And therefore he <hi>heard</hi> our <hi>Prayers,</hi> and <hi>cover'd his Head in that Day of Battle;</hi> and sent him back to us with so much the <hi>Greater Joy,</hi> by how much the nearer we were to have been <hi>utterly deprived</hi> of <hi>Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that which ought yet more to be consider'd by Us, and to raise up our Souls to a still greater heighth of <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> for this <hi>Deliverance</hi> is; that as his <hi>Danger</hi> was <hi>Imminent,</hi> so was it of such a <hi>Nature</hi> too, that nothing but the same <hi>God</hi> who preserved <hi>David</hi> heretofore from the <hi>Hurtful Sword,</hi> could have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered our <hi>King</hi> from the <hi>Stroak</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>Here was no room for <hi>Counsel</hi> or <hi>Advice;</hi> No Opportunity for any <hi>Humane Means</hi> to have interposed for his Preservation. Neither the <hi>Courage</hi> of his <hi>Bravest,</hi> nor the <hi>Conduct</hi> of his <hi>Wisest Servants,</hi> could have stood him in any Stead. No; it was that <hi>God</hi> who did <hi>Deliver</hi> Him, that alone was capable of doing of it: <hi>And therefore not unto Us, O Lord, but</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psalm Cxv. 1.</note> 
               <hi>unto thy Name be the Glory of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And these are such <hi>Circumstances</hi> as would at <hi>any time</hi> have engaged us to a <hi>lively Sense</hi> of so great a <hi>Deliverance:</hi> But at such a <hi>time</hi> as that was, in which God was pleased thus wonderfully to <hi>preserve</hi> him, to restore him again to us; this is what gives a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Addition to the <hi>Blessing</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>For a <hi>Nation</hi> to be <hi>deprived</hi> of a <hi>Good Prince,</hi> a <hi>King</hi> endued with all those <hi>Royal Vertues,</hi> which even the <hi>Enemies</hi> of our <hi>Great Soveraign</hi> cannot deny to be most Conspicuous in Him; must certainly at any time have been a very great <hi>Calamity,</hi> and what would
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60636:14"/>
have call'd for the <hi>Lamentations</hi> of all that truly valued either the <hi>Honour</hi> or <hi>Welfare</hi> of their <hi>Country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to have been <hi>deprived</hi> of such a <hi>Prince</hi> in a time of <hi>Trouble</hi> and <hi>Difficulty;</hi> when nothing but his <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,</hi> his <hi>Courage</hi> and <hi>Reputation</hi> could possibly have prevented Us from an utter <hi>Ruin</hi> and <hi>Confusion:</hi> I want words to express how <hi>Fatal</hi> the <hi>Consequence</hi> must have been of it.</p>
            <p>And yet this, or rather if possible, somewhat beyond all this was our Case, when <hi>God</hi> sent us this <hi>great Deliverance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our <hi>Enemies</hi> defied us from <hi>Abroad;</hi> They <hi>threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> us even there where we thought our selves the most <hi>Secure</hi> against Them: Where we were wont till now <hi>to give Laws,</hi> and strike Terrour into all other <hi>Nations</hi> besides. And had they obtain'd this farther <hi>Advantage</hi> against us; What could have hindred but that our very <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Nation,</hi> our <hi>Liberties</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> must for ever have been buried in <hi>Reproach,</hi> and <hi>Desolation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor was the <hi>Insolence</hi> of <hi>Those within</hi> any less. They began already to devour us again in their <hi>Hopes;</hi> and expected only when the <hi>Happy Minute</hi> should come, that would again have put them in a Condition to have <hi>accomplish'd</hi> their <hi>Wicked Designs</hi> against us.</p>
            <p>Thus did all things seem manifestly to threaten us with <hi>Rain</hi> and <hi>Confusion.</hi> Nothing now remain'd but the <hi>Dread</hi> of our absent <hi>Prince;</hi> and whom tho' at the Greatest <hi>Distance</hi> they cannot but <hi>tremble</hi> at, to rescue us from these <hi>Dangers.</hi> And we may truly say, it was the <hi>Reputation</hi> of his <hi>Name,</hi> and the <hi>Apprehension</hi> of his <hi>Conduct,</hi> that then kept us in <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Quiet,</hi> when We justly fear'd that all was running into <hi>War</hi> and <hi>Tumults.</hi> And had the <hi>Providence</hi> of <hi>God</hi> then fais'd him; had not the <hi>Almighty</hi> in a most wonderful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60636:14"/>
               <hi>preserved</hi> Him; and given him a more than Ordinary <hi>Success</hi> in his <hi>Undertakings:</hi> We should now have been perhaps One of the most <hi>Miserable,</hi> to be sure one of the most <hi>Slavish</hi> and <hi>Contemptible Nations</hi> in the World.</p>
            <p>I should much exceed the <hi>Bounds</hi> of such a <hi>Discourse</hi> as this, should I go on particularly to recount to you what mighty <hi>Deliverances</hi> God has again vouchsafed to Him, since that of which I have been hitherto speaking. To what <hi>Dangers</hi> he has been exposed in an <hi>Element</hi> that of All Others has ever been the most <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> to Him? What new <hi>Hazards</hi> he has again en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred in the <hi>Field?</hi> And all this for our sakes, to promote our <hi>Welfare,</hi> and if it be possible, secure it to <hi>all Succeding Generations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Blessed be God! Who has again brought Him back to Us in <hi>Health</hi> and <hi>Safety,</hi> and <hi>Crown'd</hi> him yet once more with <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Victory.</hi> That has turn'd those <hi>Dangers</hi> we before lay under, into some <hi>Hopes,</hi> that I do not say into a fair Prospect of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Security.</hi> That has restor'd our <hi>Country</hi> its <hi>King,</hi> Our <hi>Church</hi> its <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender,</hi> and all of us Our <hi>publick Welfare</hi> and <hi>Security.</hi> And who if We be not our selves wanting to his <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,</hi> shall by the Blessing of the same God, not only <hi>save</hi> us from <hi>Ruin,</hi> but repair our <hi>Credit,</hi> and revive that <hi>Spirit</hi> amongst us which enabled our <hi>Ancestors</hi> so Gloriously to <hi>Triumph</hi> over their <hi>Enemies</hi> heretofore: And shew that it is not in vain We either <hi>bear</hi> the <hi>Arms</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> or pretend a <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Title</hi> to it. That Our <hi>Nation</hi> is still the same it ever was, and has only wanted a <hi>Prince</hi> to lead it on. And having now at last met with such a One, who can tell but we may yet see that <hi>Proud Monarch</hi> at last shewn no longer to be <hi>Invincible?</hi> But that a <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> supported by the <hi>Favour</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Justice</hi> of his <hi>Cause,</hi> and the <hi>

            </p>
            <p>Which brings me to the Consideration of that <hi>Other sort</hi> of <hi>Deliverances</hi> which God has vouchsafed to our <hi>King,</hi> as he did to <hi>David</hi> heretofore, <hi>viz.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>In the midst of this Distress, God raised up a mighty and unexpected <hi>Salvation</hi> for us.

same time to all Appearance a better <hi>Force</hi> actually in the <hi>Field</hi> to <hi>defend</hi> it, than the Other had to <hi>force</hi> him out of it.</p>
            <p>But what can be done, when God <hi>infatuates</hi> Mens <hi>Counsels,</hi> and strikes a <hi>Terror</hi> upon their <hi>Hearts,</hi> that will not suffer them <hi>bravely</hi> to <hi>defend,</hi> what they have <hi>Vainly undertaken?</hi> And tho' <hi>Subjects</hi> for <hi>Conscience sake</hi> may <hi>submit</hi> to the most <hi>unjust Usurpations,</hi> and not <hi>dare</hi> by <hi>Force</hi> to <hi>Right</hi> themselves: Yet I think few have ever been so delicate in their <hi>Obedience,</hi> as to esteem themselves under any <hi>Obligation</hi> to fight them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into <hi>Slavery;</hi> and <hi>contend</hi> for their <hi>Chains,</hi> with those who would set them at <hi>Liberty</hi> from them.</p>
            <p>Thus did God begin to <hi>Save</hi> us from our <hi>Enemies,</hi> and <hi>from the Hands of those that Hate us;</hi> Or rather in <note place="margin">Luke I 74.</note> the <hi>words</hi> of the <hi>Text, from the hands of</hi> strange Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; <hi>whose Mouth speaketh Vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of Falshood.</hi> But we have yet more than this to fill out our <hi>Hymns of Praise</hi> and <hi>Thanksgiving.</hi> God has not only <hi>saved</hi> Us from this <hi>Danger</hi> within, but has <hi>preserved</hi> us too from that which was the natural <hi>Consequence</hi> of it, the <hi>Fury of War-Abroad:</hi> And given such a <hi>Success</hi> to our <hi>Arms,</hi> as I am perswaded the most <hi>Sanguine</hi> amongst us, could hardly have flattered Himself withall.</p>
            <p>When was it ever heard before, that a little weak <hi>Town,</hi> and a few <hi>undisciplined Men,</hi> baffled all the Attacks of a numerous <hi>Army,</hi> provided with all things necessary for the reducing of it: And at last forced them, after a <hi>Siege</hi> of <hi>Fifteen Weeks,</hi> to quit their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt as <hi>Vain</hi> and <hi>Unpracticable?</hi>
            </p>

to <hi>Defend</hi> it; Assisted by a Powerful <hi>Force</hi> from <hi>Abroad,</hi> and to all this, animated with a <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Hatred</hi> and <hi>Revenge;</hi> should yet in <hi>two years time</hi> be <hi>reduced</hi> to that Degree, as not to let the least corner of it remain <hi>Unconquer'd?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where can we find any Instances that may serve to parallel the <hi>Battles</hi> that have been <hi>fought,</hi> and the <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts</hi> that have been made upon this <hi>Occasion?</hi> Scarce did ever <hi>Despair</hi> its self oblige Men to run such <hi>Haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> as our <hi>Forces</hi> have freely done; and that by the wonderful <hi>Providence</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> with Success too.</p>
            <p>Nor let any here Object either the <hi>Treachery</hi> or <hi>Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardise</hi> of our <hi>Enemies;</hi> as if it were to those we ought to ascribe a great part of that Success we have had against them. But rather let us attribute these <hi>Blessings,</hi> as most certainly we ought to do, to the <hi>Favour</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> to the <hi>Justice</hi> of our <hi>Cause,</hi> and to the <hi>Fortunes</hi> and <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very</hi> of our <hi>Princes;</hi> dear to <hi>Heaven,</hi> and raised up by it to be the <hi>Instruments</hi> of <hi>Providence,</hi> in <hi>reforming</hi> the <hi>Manners,</hi> and <hi>redressing</hi> the <hi>Oppressions</hi> of an injured and groaning World: In short, to the Help of that Hand which has so plainly shewn its self in all this <hi>Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;</hi> that we may with Assurance cry out with the <hi>Holy Man</hi> in our <hi>Text; It is the LORD who Giveth Victory unto Kings; that hath delivered</hi> David <hi>his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant from the Hurtful Sword.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And having thus fulfill'd this <hi>first part</hi> of the <hi>Duty</hi> of this day; let us now to our <hi>Tribute</hi> of <hi>Praise</hi> and <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> add,</p>

It was the great Complaint of <hi>David</hi> heretofore, and what made him so much the more Earnest in his <hi>Requests</hi> to God for his Assistance; that his <hi>Enemies</hi> were Men of no <hi>Religion,</hi> neither whose <hi>Faith</hi> could be <hi>rely'd</hi> on, nor could any thing keep them from doing him a Mischief, but only their being reduced into such a <hi>State,</hi> as not to have it in their Power to <hi>hurt</hi> Him.</p>

And again, Vs. 11. <hi>Rid me and deliver me from the Hand of strange Children, whose Mouth speaketh Vanity, and their right-hand is a right-hand of Falsehood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that then if We would know how far we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd to joyn with <hi>David</hi> in the <hi>Prayer</hi> before us, we must stop a little, and consider how nearly <hi>our Enemies</hi> resemble his. And if upon the Enquiry it shall appear that they come up in every <hi>particular</hi> to the full <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter</hi> of those in the <hi>Text;</hi> If it shall be found that We have now to do with the same <hi>Strange Children</hi> that he had heretofore, <hi>Whose Mouth speaketh Vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of Falsehood:</hi> Then doubtless it must remain that we ought also to pray as he did, that God would <hi>rid us</hi> and <hi>deliver us</hi> out of their <hi>Hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. As to what concerns the Point of <hi>Religion;</hi> they are in the utmost import of the <hi>Phrase, Strange Children.</hi> They not only <hi>differ</hi> from us both in their <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Worship;</hi> but they do what in them lies to Destroy our <hi>Religion,</hi> and even <hi>Our selves</hi> for <hi>its sake.</hi>
