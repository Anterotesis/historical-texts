            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

THE
Triumphs of PEACE,

OF
NASSAW.</p>
            <p>A
<hi>Pindarick Poem.</hi>
Occasioned by the <hi>Conclusion of the
Peace</hi> between the <hi>Confederacy</hi>
and <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Written at the time of His Grace the Duke

By Mr. JOHN HOPKINS.</p>

THE Design of this
Poem, begins (after
the Method of <hi>Pinder</hi>) to
one great Man, and rises to
another; first touches the
Duke, then celebrates the
Actions of the King, and so
returns to the Praises of the
Duke again. Thus the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
playing on their Lyres,
to make up Harmony, first
strike one, and then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
String.</p>

The Lord CUTTS.</head>
            <l>LET some with, servile, mean
Devices bow,</l>
            <l>And bend their Souls, as well
as Bodies, low;</l>
            <l>Flatter the Great, cringe deep, to gain Esteem,</l>
            <l>And by their own Dishonour, honour them.</l>
            <l>By Wiles like these, new Favours, poorly
claim;</l>
            <l>I pay your Lordship, but what's paid by
Fame,</l>
            <l>'Tis through your Merits, not my own, I
choose</l>
            <l>Thus to salute you by my rising Muse;</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:58779:4"/>Not fawning low, like others must she sue,</l>

            <l>Let others spread their Patron's Feathers far,</l>
            <l>The Toys of Peace, your Laurels spread
thro' War.</l>
            <l>Some Pride in Wreaths, which bolder Arms
have made,</l>
            <l>But your own conquering Hands have
deckt your Head.</l>
            <l>To you, my Lord, a double Crown is due,</l>
            <l>At once the Hero, and the Poet too.</l>
            <l>Since NASSAW'S Actions still remain untold,</l>
            <l>While <hi>Dryden</hi> lives; immortal; yet he's old.</l>

            <l>With Powers unequal, I the Task resign,</l>

            <l>What other Genius can our Sovereign choose?</l>
            <l>War's your Delight, <hi>Bellona</hi> is your Muse.</l>

            <l>With the same vigour and impulse of thought,</l>
            <l>Now may you write, as thro' the Plains you

            <l>In the Attempt, tho' my weak Genius fail,</l>

            <l>Unknown, this Favour dare I humbly claim,</l>

               <l>Return, ye Muses, tune your Lyres</l>
               <l>To ORMOND'S Praise, his Merit this
requires.</l>
               <l>A Crown of Laurels, and of Olives
mixt,</l>
               <l>Give NASSAW first, but give to ORMOND
next.</l>
               <l>ORMOND, whose Race does, Phenix-like,
arise,</l>
               <l>A brighter Off-Spring when the Parent
dies.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Hibernia</hi> blest with present Power,</l>

be given,</l>
               <l>All seem assur'd that he should bless them
more;</l>
               <l>Fonder of him—than they would be of
others sent from Heav'n.</l>
               <l>Wielding the flaming Sword of Justice here,</l>
               <l>He would the Cherub of the place appear,</l>
               <l>This can the mighty ORMOND do,</l>
               <l>Make it a Paradise, and guard it too.</l>
               <l>Blest as our primitive Parents then,</l>
               <l>Beneath his Government, and NASSAW'S
Reign,</l>
               <l>The People nere would fall again;</l>
               <l>Nor from their Seat of Bliss would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly

               <l>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:58779:50"/>Tho' for the universal Rule of the subjected
World.</l>
               <l>Blest are these Isles, nor shall their Blessings
cease,</l>
               <l>While NASSAW reigns, the God of War,
and he the Prince of Peace.</l>

            <l>PUT off, dread Sir, those awful Looks,
and smile,</l>
            <l>Be only now the Glory of our Isle.</l>
            <l>Lay down the Terror; such a Mildness
shew,</l>
            <l>As when the Captives of your Arms you
view.</l>
            <l>Thus may the Subject with the Prince con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,</l>
            <l>What the Muse speaks, the Monarch stoops
to hear:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:58779:52"/>Secure she flies, none imps her sacred
Wings,</l>
            <l>Free as the Winds, which bear her, on she
sings,</l>
            <l>And flutters boldly o'er the Heads of
Kings.</l>
            <l>Dares, like the Royal Bird, undaunted rove,</l>
            <l>And plays with Light'nings, which belong
to <hi>Iove.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>The Gods allow our Off'rings should be
giv'n,</l>
            <l>We send our Praise, as well as Pray'rs to
Heav'n.</l>
            <l>Ev'n the Almighty, who was all before,</l>
            <l>Commands us Mortals to extol him more.</l>
            <l>Not that our Thoughts his Attributes can
crown,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:58779:52"/>But that he so may shed his Blessings down.</l>
            <l>Thus, from our Claims to thee our Honours
spring,</l>
            <l>The greatest Conqu'rour, and the greatest
King.</l>
            <l>Defending still what you have once restor'd,</l>
            <l>You sway your Scepter, as you wield your
Sword.</l>
            <l>In humblest Thanks, and Vows, we make
return,</l>
            <l>Heav'n bestows Favours; Mortals Incense
burn.</l>
