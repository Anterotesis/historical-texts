            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

INTRODUCTION</head>
                     <p>THE <hi>Father of Lies</hi> is the <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>Miſ-repreſenting.</hi>
He firſt made the Experiment of this <hi>Black Art</hi> in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe;
having no ſurer way of bringing God's <hi>Precept</hi>
into Contempt, and making our <hi>Firſt Parents</hi> tranſgreſs,
than by <hi>Miſ-repreſenting</hi> the <hi>Command,</hi> which their <hi>Maker</hi>
had laid upon them. And ſo unhappily ſucceſsful he
was in this his firſt attempt, that this has been his chief ſtratagem ever
ſince, in all buſineſs of difficulty and concern: eſteeming That his beſt
<hi>Means</hi> for preſerving and propagating Wickedneſs amongſt Men, by
which he firſt won them to loſe their Innocence. And therefore there
<pb facs="tcp:55205:2"/>
has nothing of <hi>Good</hi> yet come into the World, nothing been ſent from
Heaven, but what has met with this Oppoſition; the Common Emeny
having imploy'd all his Endeavours of bringing it into diſcredit, and
rendring it Infamous, by <hi>Miſ-repreſenting</hi> it. Of this there are frequent
Inſtances in the <hi>Old Law,</hi> and more in the <hi>New.</hi> The truth of it was
experienc'd on the <hi>Perſon</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, who, tho' he was the <hi>Son of
God,</hi> the <hi>Immaculate Lamb,</hi> yet was he not out of the reach of <hi>Calumny,</hi>
and exempt from being <hi>Miſrepreſented.</hi> See how he was painted by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
Men, the Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> Miniſters of <hi>Satan; a prophane and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Man, a breaker of the Sabbath, a Glutton, a Friend and Companion of
Publicans and Sinners, a Fool, a Conjurer, a Traytor, a Seducer, a Tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Perſon, a Samaritan, full of the Devil; he hath Belzebub, and by the
Prince of the Devils, caſteth he out Devils, (Mark</hi> 3. 22.) There being
no other way of frighting the People from embracing the <hi>Truth,</hi> and
following the Son of God, but by thus disfiguring him to the Multitude,
reporting Light to be Darkneſs, and God to be the Devil. The Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Chriſt every where met with the like encounters. <hi>Stephen</hi> had
the people ſtirred up againſt him, becauſe they <hi>heard he had ſpoke blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
words againſt</hi> Moſes, <hi>and againſt God, (Acts</hi> 6. 11.) <hi>Paul</hi> alſo
and <hi>Silas,</hi> for <hi>exceedingly troubling the City, (Acts</hi> 16. 20.) <hi>Jaſon</hi> alſo with
them, becauſe he had <hi>turned the World upſide down, and did contrary to the
decrees of</hi> Caeſar, (<hi>Acts</hi> 17. 6, 7.) <hi>Paul</hi> again, becauſe he did <hi>teach all men
every where againſt the people, and polluted the holy place, (Acts</hi> 21. 28.) And
becauſe he was <hi>a peſtilent fellow, and a mover of ſedition among all the Jews
throughout the World:</hi> to which the <hi>Jews alſo aſſented, ſaying, that theſe
things were ſo, Acts</hi> 24. 5, 9.) Neither did theſe <hi>Calumnies,</hi> theſe wicked
<hi>Miſrepreſentations</hi> ſtop here; he that ſaid, <hi>The Diſciple is not above his
Maſter, if they have called the Maſter of the houſe Belzebub; how much more
ſhall they call them of his houſhold?</hi> did not only foretell what was to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to his <hi>Followers</hi> then preſent, but alſo to the <hi>Faithful</hi> that were to
ſucceed them, and to his <hi>Church</hi> in future ages, they being all to expect
the like Fate; that tho' they ſhould be never ſo juſt to God and their
Neighbour, upright in their Ways, and live in the fear of God, and the
obſervance of his Laws; yet muſt they certainly be <hi>reviled</hi> and <hi>hated</hi>
by the World, made a <hi>by-word</hi> to the people, and have the repute of
<hi>Ideots, Seducers,</hi> and be a <hi>ſcandal</hi> to all Nations. And has not this been
verify'd in all ages? See what was the ſtate of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
times, when as yet Vice had not corrupted the purity of the Goſpel.
'Tis almoſt impoſſible to believe in what contempt they were, and how
utterly abominated. <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who was a ſharer of a great part, gives
us ſo lamentable an account of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in his time, that 'tis able
<pb facs="tcp:55205:2"/>
to move compaſſion in ſtones. He tells us, ſo many <hi>malicious ſlanders</hi>
were diſpers'd abroad, concerning the manner of their <hi>Worſhip;</hi> and
their whole <hi>Doctrin</hi> deſcrib'd, not only to be <hi>folly, and meer toys,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
to be grounded on moſt <hi>helliſh Principles,</hi> and to be ſo full of <hi>Impieties,</hi>
that the Heathens believ'd a man could not make profeſſion of <hi>Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
without being tainted with all ſorts of <hi>Crimes;</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being an enemy to the <hi>Gods,</hi>

                        <hi>to Princes, to the Laws, to
good Manners, and to Nature.</hi> Hence they conceiv'd ſuch
<hi>prejudice</hi> againſt them, and they were render'd ſo <hi>impious</hi> in the opinion
of the <hi>Vulgar;</hi> that whatſoever <hi>accuſations</hi> were brought in, tho' never
ſo <hi>falſe and malicious;</hi> whatſoever <hi>Villanies</hi> were laid to their charge;
all was welcom to the <hi>enraged Multitude,</hi> to which nothing ſeem'd <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible</hi>
concerning <hi>thoſe,</hi> that were thus already <hi>odious.</hi> Upon this it
was, that they were brought in guilty of <hi>Atheiſm, of Superſtition, of

Perſecutions were rais'd againſt them, to which the people were exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated

                        <hi>Tertullian</hi> has done,
I'le ſet it down in his own words, as tranſlated by
<note n="e" place="margin">P. 1. pag. 936.</note> Dr. <hi>Hovel,</hi> in his <hi>Hiſtory of the World. Is it not
ſtrange</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that the hatred wherewith this name is
<pb facs="tcp:55205:3"/>
purſued in ſuch manner, blinds the minds of most Men, that when they wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
the probity of a</hi> Chriſtian, <hi>they mix in their Diſcourſe as a reproach,</hi> that
he hath embraced this Religion. <hi>One ſaith; Truly, He of whom you ſpeak
is an Honeſt Man, if he were not a</hi> Chriſtan, <hi>and his life would be free
from blame. Another; Do you know ſuch a one, who had the reputation of
a Wiſe and Diſceeet Man? He is lately turn'd</hi> Chriſtian. (<hi>Again) Theſe
People, by an extreme</hi> blindneſs of hatred, <hi>ſpeak to the advantage of the name</hi>
Chriſtian, <hi>when they ſtrive to render it</hi> Odious. <hi>For, ſay they, How plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,
and of what a good humour, was that Woman? How ſociable and jovial
was that Man? 'Tis pity they ſhould be</hi> Chriſtians. <hi>So they impute the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment
of their lives, to the Profeſſion of</hi> Chriſtianity. <hi>Some of them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
purchaſe the</hi> averſion <hi>they carry againſt the name</hi> Chriſtian, <hi>which we bear,
with the price of what is moſt precious to them; rather deſiring to loſe the
ſweetneſs of life, tranquility of mind, and all ſorts of Commodities, than to ſee
in their Houſes That which they hate. A Man, who heretofore had his mind
full of</hi> Jealouſie, <hi>can no longer endure the company of his</hi> Wife, <hi>what aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
ſoever he has of her Chaſtity, after once he perceives her to be turn'd</hi>
Chriſtian; <hi>and parts from her now, when her actions full of Modeſty have
extinguiſh'd all ſuſpicions, wherewith he was heretofore mov'd. A</hi> Father,
<hi>who of a long time endur'd the diſobedience of his</hi> Heatheniſh Son, <hi>reſolves to
take from him the hope of ſucceeding him in his Inheritance, for</hi> turning
Chriſtian, <hi>when at the ſame time, executing his Commands without murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.
A</hi> Maſter <hi>that uſed his</hi> Slave <hi>gently, when his Carriage gave him ſome
cauſe of diſtruſt, now puts him far from him, for being a</hi> Chriſtian, <hi>when he
hath most aſſurance of his Fidelity. 'Tis committing a</hi> Crime <hi>to correct the
diſorders of a Man's Life, by the motions of a Holy Converſion to the</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Faith; <hi>and the good which is produc'd by ſo happy a</hi> Change, <hi>works not
ſo powerfully in the minds of Men, as the hatred they have conceiv'd againſt us.
Indeed this hatred is ſtrange; and when I conſider, that the Name of</hi> Chriſtian
<hi>only, makes it be ſo, I would willingly know, how a name can be Criminal,
and how a ſimple word can be Accuſed?</hi> Thus was Chriſtianity wholly <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous</hi>
amongſt the <hi>Heathens,</hi> contemn'd and deteſted by all; and where
<hi>Lies</hi> were in credit, <hi>Calumnies</hi> and <hi>Slanders</hi> confirm'd and back'd by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi>
there was no other Crime but <hi>Truth.</hi> And 'twas theſe <hi>Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi>
theſe <hi>falſe Accuſations</hi> (invented to cry down the Chriſtian Religion,)
oblig'd <hi>Tertullian</hi> to write his <hi>Apology,</hi> wherein he declar'd to the World,
that <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> was nothing like that, which the Heathens imagin'd it
to be: That <hi>Idolatry, Superſtition, Impiety Cruelty, Treachery, Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi>
&amp;c. was none of their <hi>Doctrine,</hi> but Condemn'd and Deteſted by
them; that theſe <hi>Crimes</hi> were only the <hi>malicious inventions</hi> of the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh
Prieſts,</hi> who finding themſelves unable to withſtand the <hi>force of
<pb facs="tcp:55205:3"/>
Chriſtianity,</hi> had no other way to preſerve <hi>themſelves</hi> in <hi>Repute,</hi> and the
<hi>People</hi> in their <hi>Errour,</hi> than by forming an ugly, odious, and moſt horrid
<hi>Viſor,</hi> a damnable Scheme of Religion, then holding this forth to the
World, and crying out, <hi>This is the Religion of the Chriſtians, theſe are
their Principles; Behold their ignorance, their Stupidity, their Prophaneneſs;
Behold their Inſolence, their Villanies; a People unſufferable in a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
Enemies to their Country and their Prince:</hi> And thus Repreſenting
it as <hi>Monſtrous</hi> as they pleas'd, they brought an <hi>odium</hi> upon as many as
own'd that <hi>name,</hi> and condemn'd them for <hi>Follies</hi> and <hi>Crimes,</hi> that were
no where, but in their own <hi>Imagination.</hi> And 'twas not only in <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>'s
time, that <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> lay under <hi>this ſcandal,</hi> but alſo in after A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges:
And therefore, as for the Vindication of the Chriſtian Profeſſion,
he was forc'd to Apologize for his time; ſo did after him St. <hi>Cyprian,
Arnobius,</hi> and many other Eccleſiaſtical Writers; nay, and under Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Emperors, the <hi>Calumnies</hi> of the <hi>Heathens</hi> yet being urg'd with much
vigour and confidence, <hi>Oroſius</hi> was oblig'd to write his Hiſtory, and St.
<hi>Augustine his City of God,</hi> in defence of the <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Doctrine</hi> of Chriſt.
And now, when by the propagation of Chriſtianity, and the laborious
endeavours of her Profeſſors, Heatheniſm was pretty well extinct; yet
was not the Mouth of <hi>Malice</hi> ſtop'd; the ſame <hi>Calumnies,</hi> which had
been invented by the <hi>Infidels,</hi> being taken up by <hi>evil Chriſtians.</hi> No one
<hi>going</hi> out from the Communion of the <hi>Church</hi> of Chriſt, but what did,
by reviving <hi>old Scandals,</hi> (and the addition of <hi>freſh</hi> ones,) endeavour to
make her <hi>Infamous,</hi> and <hi>blacken</hi> her with ſuch Crimes, as could be thought
moſt convenient for rendring her <hi>Odious</hi> to all. It being look'd upon by
as many as ever <hi>went out</hi> of her, the beſt means to juſtifie their <hi>Separation,</hi>
and to gain to themſelves the credit of <hi>Orthodox</hi> Chriſtians; to paint
<hi>her</hi> out in all the <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Colours, and repreſent her as <hi>Helliſh,</hi> as
wickedneſs could make her. 'Tis ſtrange how much ſhe ſuffer'd in this
Point from the <hi>Manichees,</hi> and from the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> and how much pains
it coſt Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> to prove their <hi>Accuſations</hi> to be meer <hi>Calumnies,</hi>
principally intended to raiſe <hi>prejudices</hi> in the minds of the <hi>People</hi> againſt
her; that ſo being convinc'd by theſe Helliſh Artifices, of her teaching
<hi>unſound</hi> and <hi>prophane Doctrine, wicked Principles,</hi> and <hi>humane Inventions</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of <hi>Faith,</hi> might never think of going to <hi>her,</hi> to learn the <hi>Truth;</hi>
nor even ſo much as ſuſpect <hi>her</hi> to be the <hi>Church</hi> of Chriſt. This, Saint
<hi>Auguſtine</hi> complains, was the chief cauſe of his continuing in the Errour
of the <hi>Manichees</hi> ſo long; and that he impugn'd with ſo much violence
this <hi>Church.</hi> And therefore, after he was come to the knowledge of
the <hi>Truth,</hi> he diſcover'd this to the World for the undeceiving others,
who were caught in the ſame ſnare, making it part of his Confeſſions, (<hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſ.

l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 1.) <hi>When I came to diſcover,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that—I ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
joy and bluſhes, and was aſham'd, that I had now for ſo many years been
barking and railing, not againſt the Catholick Faith, but only againſt the ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of my carnal conceits. For ſo temerarious and impious was I, that, thoſe
things, which I ought firſt to have learned from them by enquiry, I firſt charg'd
upon them by Accuſation; readier to impoſe Falſhoods, than to be inform'd of
the Truth.—And thus I ſo blindly accuſed the Catholick Church; now
ſufficiently clear'd to me that ſhe taught not the Opinion, I ſo vehemently perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</hi>
And this he did, deluded and deceiv'd by the <hi>Manichees.</hi> And
now ſince 'tis certain, that this has not been the caſe of Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi>
alone, but of as many almoſt, as have given ear to the <hi>Deſerters</hi> of <hi>this
Church;</hi> nay, is at this day the caſe of infinite Numbers, who follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Great <hi>Father,</hi> when as yet in his <hi>Errors; do not enquire, how this
thing is believ'd or understood by her, but inſultingly oppoſe all; as if ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
as they imagine; not making any difference betwixt that which the
Catholick Church teaches, and what they think ſhe teaches;</hi> and ſo believing
her to be guilty of as many <hi>Abſurdities, Follies, Impieties,</hi> &amp;c. as the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi>
did of Old: 'Tis evident, there's as much need now of <hi>Apologies,</hi>
as ever there was in <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s, or Saint <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s time: Not <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies</hi>
to vindicate what is really her <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Doctrine;</hi> but rather to clear
her from ſuch <hi>Superſitions, Prophaneneſs,</hi> and <hi>Wicked Principles,</hi> as are <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly</hi>
or <hi>ignorantly</hi> charg'd upon her. And tho' the number of Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
the in-ſincerity of Adverſaries, the obſtinacy of a byas'd Education
render a performance in this kind, a juſt Task for a <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s, or St.
<hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s hand; yet becauſe I find no ſuch eminent Pen engag'd in this
deſign at preſent; and the ſhewing the <hi>true Religion</hi> in its <hi>own Colours,</hi>
ſeems a Duty incumbent on every one that's a lover of Truth; I'le en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to pull off the <hi>Vizor</hi> from <hi>ſuffering Chriſtianity,</hi> and Apologize
for the <hi>Catholick Faith;</hi> that Faith I mean, maintained by thoſe <hi>Primitive
Fathers,</hi> with ſo much Vigour and Zeal; which being firſt planted in the
<hi>Head City</hi> of the World by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> hath been propagated throughout
the Univerſe, and derived down to us by many Chriſtian Nations, in
Communion with that <hi>See,</hi> under the Protection of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and
the charge of <hi>A Chief Paſtor,</hi> which beginning in that <hi>great Apoſtle,</hi> has
continued in a <hi>Viſible Succeſſion</hi> to theſe our days. This <hi>Faith</hi> it is, for
which at preſent I deſign to make an Apology, which having been in all
ages violently oppos'd, does at this time moſt <hi>wrongfully</hi> ſuffer, under
<hi>Calumnies</hi> and <hi>falſe Imputations.</hi> I'le endeavour therefore to ſeparate
theſe <hi>Calumnies</hi> and <hi>Scandals,</hi> from what is <hi>really</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Doctrine</hi>
of that Church, I'le take off the <hi>Black</hi> and <hi>Dirt,</hi> which has been thrown,
upon her; and ſetting her forth in her <hi>genuine</hi> complexion, let the World
<pb facs="tcp:55205:4"/>
ſee how much <hi>fairer</hi> ſhe is, than ſhe's <hi>painted;</hi> and how much ſhe's <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like</hi>
that <hi>Monſter,</hi> which is ſhewn for her. And becauſe the <hi>Members</hi>
of this <hi>Church</hi> are commonly known by the name of <hi>Papiſts;</hi> I think I
cannot take a more ſincere, open, and compendious way, in order to
the compleating this deſign, than by drawing forth a <hi>double Character</hi>
of a <hi>Papiſt:</hi> The <hi>one</hi> expreſſing a <hi>Papiſt</hi> in thoſe very <hi>colours</hi> as he is
painted in the <hi>imagination</hi> of the <hi>Vulgar, Foul, Black</hi> and <hi>Antichriſtian;</hi>
with the chief <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ticles</hi> of his <hi>imagined Belief,</hi> and <hi>reputed Principles</hi> of
his Profeſſion. The <hi>other</hi> repreſenting a <hi>Papist,</hi> whoſe <hi>Faith</hi> and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of his <hi>Religion,</hi> is according to the <hi>Direction</hi> and <hi>Command</hi> of <hi>his
Church.</hi> That ſo, theſe two being thus ſet together, their <hi>difference</hi> and
<hi>diſproportion</hi> may be clearly diſcerned, and a diſcovery made, how <hi>unlike
Calumny</hi> is from <hi>Truth;</hi> and how different a <hi>Papiſt really is,</hi> from what
he's <hi>ſaid to be.</hi> The <hi>former</hi> Character is of a <hi>Papist Miſ-repreſented;</hi> the
<hi>other</hi> of a <hi>Papiſt Repreſented.</hi> The former is a <hi>Papist</hi> ſo deform'd and
monſtrous, that it juſtly deſerves the hatred of as many as own <hi>Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;</hi>
'Tis a <hi>Papist,</hi> that has diſturb'd this Nation now above an hundred
years with Fears and Jealouſies; threatning it continually with Fire and
Maſſacres, and whoſe whole deſign has been, to rob the <hi>Sovereign</hi> of his
Crown, and the <hi>Subject</hi> of his <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Property.</hi> 'Tis a <hi>Papist,</hi> that
is ſo abominable, ſo malicious, ſo unſufferable in any Civil Government,
that, for my part, I deteſt him from my heart; I conceiv'd an hatred
againſt him, and all his, from my Education, when as yet a <hi>Proteſtant;</hi>
and now, being a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> I am not in the leaſt reconcil'd to
<hi>him,</hi> nor his <hi>Principles,</hi> but hate him yet worſe. I am ſo far from
thinking the <hi>Laws</hi> too ſevere againſt <hi>ſuch Popiſh Recuſants,</hi> that I could
wiſh a far greater ſeverity were executed againſt them, their Favourers,
and all ſuch as make men ſo ſottiſhly Religious. And if to be a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi>
nothing more be requiſite, than to proteſt againſt <hi>ſuch Popery,</hi> to hate
and deteſt it; I think my ſelf, and all <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> as good <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,</hi>
as any whatſoever throughout his <hi>Majesties</hi> Dominions. And
I dare engage, that not only as many <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> as under the
name of <hi>Papists</hi> have ſeverely ſmarted in this Nation, for being the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
of <hi>ſuch kind of Popery,</hi> but alſo that all <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Nations
in the World ſhall ſubſcribe to the condemnation of all <hi>ſuch</hi> Popiſh Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples

it, with all that Profeſs or Practice it, and utter rooting it
out from his <hi>Majesties</hi> three Kingdoms, and the whole Univerſe. The
other <hi>Papist</hi> is one, that lives and believes according to what is preſcrib'd
in the <hi>Council of Trent,</hi> in <hi>Catechiſms</hi> ſet forth by Catholicks, and other
Spiritual Books, for the Direction and Inſtruction of all in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion;
<pb facs="tcp:55205:5"/>
whoſe <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Doctrine</hi> I have here ſet down, with ſome
Grounds and Reaſons of it, and will ſo leave it to Apologize for it ſelf.
In drawing out the Character of the <hi>former,</hi> I have quoted no <hi>Authors,</hi>
but have deſcrib'd him exactly according to the Apprehenſion I had of a
<hi>Papiſt,</hi> fram'd by Me when I was a <hi>Proteſtant;</hi> with the addition only
of ſome few points, which have been violently charg'd againſt Me by
ſome intimate Friends of late, to ſhew the unreaſonableneſs of my choice,
after the quitting of that Communion. The latter is wholly copied
out from the <hi>Papist</hi> that <hi>I am now;</hi> being the Sum of what I was
taught, when reconcil'd to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and which after ſixteen
years converſation with Men of that Communion, in hearing their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
in being preſent at their Catechiſing, in reading their Books, and
diſcourſing with them, I have found to be their <hi>Doctrine.</hi> I have done both,
I hope, with Sincerity and Truth, and without Paſſion. For as my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
have been, that my <hi>Religion</hi> ſhould loſe nothing by <hi>Lies,</hi> ſo neither
do I deſire it ſhould gain by them; And did I but know of any thing in
the following Papers, that has any relation to that <hi>unchristian Artifice,</hi>
I would ſtrike it out immediately. And do here oblige my ſelf, upon
information, either from Friend or Adverſary, to acknowledge the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake,
as it ſhall be made appear, and make a publick Recantation. But
it is time, we ſhould ſee what theſe <hi>Papiſts</hi> are.</p>

but the ſight of theſe, re-cals his wandring thoughts to the right Object;

that theſe holy <hi>Pictures</hi> and <hi>Images</hi> repreſent and bring to his mind <hi>ſuch</hi>
Objects, which in his heart he loves, honours, and venerates; he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,

As whoſoever loves their <hi>Husband, Child,</hi> or <hi>Friend,</hi> cannot but

That it really contains the Body of

and <hi>Reaſon</hi> to Chriſt's <hi>Words</hi> in the obſequiouſneſs of Faith: And that

did, promptly, with a Faith <hi>ſuperiour</hi> to all <hi>Senſe</hi> or <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and whither

was really the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> though <hi>Senſes</hi> or <hi>Reaſon</hi> could diſcover it to be

ſaw ſtanding over againſt him with his Sword drawn, (<hi>Joſh.</hi> 5. 13.)
and the three Men that <hi>Abraham</hi> entertain'd in the Plains of <hi>Mambre,

Proportion, Talking, Eating, and many others, of their being <hi>Men;</hi>
yet, without any diſcredit to his Senſes, he really believes they were no
ſuch thing, becauſe <hi>God's Word</hi> has aſſured him of the contrary: And
with <hi>this Faith</hi> he believes Chriſt's <hi>Body and Blood</hi> to be really preſent in
the Bleſſed Sacrament, though, to all appearance, there's nothing more
than Bread and Wine: Thus, not at all hearkning to his <hi>Senſes</hi> in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
where God ſpeaks, he unfeignedly confeſſes, That he that made the
World of nothing by his ſole word: That cured Diſeaſes by his Word:
That raiſed the Dead by his Word: That expell'd Devils: That com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Winds and Seas: That multiplied Bread: That changed
Water into Wine by his Word, and Sinners into Juſt Men, cannot want
Power to <hi>change</hi> Bread and Wine into his own Body and Blood by his
<hi>ſole Word.</hi> And this without danger of multiplying his Body, of making
as many Chriſts as Altars, or leaving the right hand of his <hi>Father.</hi> But
only by giving to his Body a <hi>ſupernatural</hi> manner of <hi>Exiſtence;</hi> by which,
being left without <hi>eztenſion</hi> of parts, and rendred <hi>independent</hi> of place,
it may be one and the ſame in many places at once, and whole in every
part of the Symbols, and not obnoxious to any corporeal Contingencies.
And this kind of Exiſtence is no more, than what in a manner he beſtows
upon every <hi>Glorified Body:</hi> Than what his own Body had, when born
without the leaſt violation of his Mothers Virginal Integrity: When
he aroſe from the Dead, out of the Sepulchre, without removing the
Stone: When he entred amongſt his Diſciples, the Doors being ſhut.
And though he cannot underſtand how this is done, yet he undoubtedly
believes, That God is able to do more than He is able to underſtand.</p>

are, or may be injoyn'd by the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors</hi>

<hi>Church,</hi> of <hi>binding and looſing:</hi> whereby Authority was given to erect a
<hi>Court of Conſcience,</hi> to aſſign Penalties, or releaſe them, as circumſtances
ſhould require. And this Authority he knows Saint <hi>Paul</hi> plainly own'd;
(2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6.) where he decreed a Penance; <hi>ſufficient</hi> (ſays he) <hi>to ſuch a

your ſake</hi> (ſpeaking of the Penance injoyn'd the Inceſtuous <hi>Corinthian,) I
forgive it in the Perſon of Chriſt.</hi> And what <hi>Money</hi> there is given at any time

wherefore they judge it moſt Charity. And tho' he acknowledges many

And yet allows the Books of <hi>Toby,

<hi>ſuch;</hi> not only in theſe later Ages,

Alſo St. <hi>Ambroſe, (lib. de Jacob. &amp;

by the Third Council of <hi>Carthage,
Anno</hi> 419. which approv'd all theſe

confirm'd in the Sixth General Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod.
<hi>Auguſt. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Doct. Chriſt. cap.</hi> 8.
So that to him 'tis of little concern,
whether they were ever in the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
Copy;</hi> the Canon of the <hi>Church</hi>
of Chriſt being of much more Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
with him, than the Canon of the <hi>Jews:</hi> He having no other aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
that the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the four Goſpels, are the true <hi>Word</hi> of
God, but by the <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> And this he has

were <hi>Canonical</hi> or no; and amongſt others, St. <hi>Jerom;</hi> becauſe the <hi>Church</hi>
had not declar'd them ſo: But ſince the <hi>Church</hi>'s Declaration, no Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
ever doubted; no more than of other Books, <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>Epiſtle to the</hi>

for many years after the Apoſtles time doubted of; but afterwards decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and receiv'd as <hi>Canonical.</hi> This he finds St. <hi>Jerome</hi> expreſly confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of himſelf, <hi>viz. That for ſome time the Book of</hi> Judith <hi>ſeemed to him
Apocryphal;</hi> to wit, till the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> declar'd it otherwiſe. <hi>Praef.
in Judith.</hi> The like he affirms of St. <hi>James's Epiſtle;</hi> that it was doubted
of by many, for ſeveral years; <hi>Paulatim tempore procedente meruit authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem:
By little and little in proceſs of time it gain'd Authority. De viris

And the thing, that ſhe is to be thus

being <hi>all truth: He ſhall teach you all

by theſe <hi>Promiſes,</hi> that the Church of Chriſt ſhall be taught all

at other times, either through <hi>Pride</hi> or <hi>Ignorance,</hi> prevaricate, make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations
in Faith, teach Erroneous Doctrines, and endeavour to draw
numbers after them; yet he is taught, that this does not at all argue a
<hi>Fallibility</hi> in the Church; nor prejudice her <hi>Faith,</hi> but only the <hi>Perſons,</hi>
that thus unhappily fall into theſe Errours, and cut themſelves off from
being Members of the Myſtical <hi>Body</hi> of Chriſt upon Earth: Whilſt the
<hi>Belief</hi> of the Church remains pure and untainted; and experiences the
Truth of what St. <hi>Paul</hi> foretold, That <hi>Grievous Wolves ſhall enter in among
you, not ſparing the Flock: Alſo of your own ſelves ſhall Men ariſe, ſpeaking
perverſe things, to draw away Diſciples after them, (Act.</hi> 20. <hi>v.</hi> 29. 30.)
which, as it prov'd true even in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> time by the fall of <hi>Nicholas</hi>
and his followers, as alſo of ſeveral others: So it has been verified in all
Ages ſince, by turbulent and preſuming Spirits, broaching new Doctrines,
and making <hi>Separations</hi> and <hi>Schiſms:</hi> But this without caſting any more
aſperſion on the Church or Congregation of the <hi>Faithful,</hi> than the fall of
<hi>Judas</hi> did on the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> or the Rebellion of <hi>Lucifer</hi> on the Hierarchy of
<hi>Angels;</hi> which was no more than that ſuch wicked and preſuming Spirits,
<hi>went out</hi> from amongſt them, and were <hi>expell'd</hi> their Communion, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy.
Neither does it reflect at all on the Churches <hi>Authority,</hi> or make
the truth of her Doctrine queſtionable to him; that many of her Eminent
Members, Doctors, Prelates and Leading Men, have been, or are great
enormous Sinners, infamous for their <hi>Pride, covetouſneſs,</hi> or other <hi>Vices,</hi>
whatſoever: The <hi>Promiſes</hi> of God's <hi>continual and un-interrupted aſſiſtance</hi>
to his Church, being not to be fruſtrated by the wickedneſs of ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Men, tho' in great Dignities. Theſe <hi>Promiſes</hi> being made ſurer to
her, than ever the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church: Which nevertheleſs ſtood firm in her
<hi>Authority,</hi> and the <hi>Delivery of Truth,</hi> notwithſtanding the frequent <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi>

Nay, tho' all things touching Religion and Virtue, were in a manner run
to decay, in our Saviour's time, both in Prieſts and People; yet did he
maintain the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church; and commanded all to be
Obedient, and ſubmit to thoſe who had the ſuperiority; without calling
in queſtion their Authority, or doubting of the reaſonableneſs of their

to <hi>Lie</hi> or <hi>Forſwear;</hi> or make, that
the breaking of any the <hi>leaſt</hi> Divine
Precept, ſhall not be accountable
for at the day of Judgement. He is
taught by his <hi>Church</hi> in all Books of

Devil himſelf, or ſome deviliſh <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters</hi>
of his, ſuch as he deteſts in his

in conſequence to this he believes,
That whoſoever at the hour of his
death denies any Crime, of which he
is guilty, and proteſts himſelf to be
innocent, when he is not ſo; can
have no hope of Mercy: but depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out of this World, and enemy to
God, and the Truth, ſhall infallibly
be receiv'd as ſuch in the next; and
dying with a <hi>Lie</hi> in his mouth, can
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55205:19"/>
expect no reward, but from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Lies. And this, whatſoever
his Crime was, whether incurr'd by
an undertaking for <hi>Mother-Church,</hi>
or no; and whatſoever his Pretences
for the denial of the Truth were,
whether <hi>Abſolutions, Dispenſations,</hi> the
<hi>Sacrament,</hi> or <hi>Oath of Secreſie,</hi> or
whatſoever elſe: nothing of theſe
being capable of excuſing him in
<hi>Lies</hi> or <hi>Perjury,</hi> or making them to
be <hi>Innocent,</hi> and not diſpleaſing to
God. Nor indeed did he ever hear
of theſe ſo much talk'd on, <hi>Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations</hi>
and <hi>Abſolutions,</hi> from any
Prieſts of his <hi>Church,</hi> either in Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
or Confeſſions; he never read
of them in his Books &amp; Catechiſms;
he never ſaw the Practice of them in any of his <hi>Communion;</hi> it having been
their Cuſtom, ever ſince <hi>Oaths</hi> were firſt devis'd againſt them, rather to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the loſs of their Goods, Baniſhments, Impriſonments, Torments, and
Death it ſelf, than <hi>Forſwear</hi> themſelves, or proteſt the leaſt Untruth. And
'tis not out of the memory of Man, that ſeveral might have ſaved their
Eſtates, and Lives too, would they have ſubſcrib'd to, and own'd but <hi>one
Lie,</hi> and yet refus'd it; chuſing rather to die Infamouſly, than prejudice
their Conſcience with an <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntruth.</hi> So that it ſeems a great Myſtery to
him, that thoſe of his Profeſſion, ſhould have Leave and <hi>Dispenſations</hi> to
Lie and Forſwear themſelves at pleaſure, and yet that they ſhould need
nothing elſe but <hi>Lying</hi> and <hi>Perjury,</hi> for the quiet enjoyment of their Eſtates,
for the ſaving their Lives, for the obtaining Places of higheſt Command,
and greateſt Dignity; ſuch as would be extraordinarily advantagious
for their Cauſe, and the intereſt of their Church. And yet that they
ſhould generally chuſe rather to forego all theſe ſo conſiderable Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
than once <hi>Lie</hi> or <hi>Forſwear</hi> themſelves. And is it not another great
Myſtery, that theſe <hi>Dispenſations</hi> for Lying and Swearing ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>Receiv'd Doctrine</hi> of his <hi>Church;</hi> and yet that he, or any of
his Communion, were never inſtructed nor inform'd of any ſuch Diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Point? nay, had never come to the knowledge of it, had it not been
for the Information receiv'd from ſome Zealous Adverſaries, ſuch as relate

the Being of a <hi>Third Place,</hi> (call'd

to all, or any of theſe, that it
is atteſted, confirm'd and eſtabliſh'd
by them all. 'Tis expreſly in the 2d,
<hi>of the Machabees,</hi> c. 12. where Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

Now though theſe <hi>Books</hi> are not

for the Confutation of Errors,

Thus were they us'd by <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigen</hi>
for Condemnation of the <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinan
Hereticks, (Orig. in cap.</hi> 5.
<hi>Ep. ad Rom.</hi>) thus by St. <hi>Cyprian,
(Lib. de Exhor. Mart. c.</hi> 11.) thus
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55205:22"/>
by <hi>Euſeb. Caeſarienſis,) Lib. Praepar.
Evang.</hi> 11. <hi>c.</hi> 15.) thus by St. <hi>Greg.

would never have been put to <hi>this

have produc'd their <hi>Authority,</hi> nor would they have been read by the

<hi>Dream,</hi> contrary to <hi>Reaſon,</hi> the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Antiquity;</hi> or had it
been any <hi>Error</hi> at all. The being alſo of a <hi>Third Place</hi> is plainly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
by our <hi>Saviour, (Matth.</hi> 12. 32.) where he ſays, <hi>Whoſoever ſpeaks
againſt the Holy Ghoſt, it ſhall not be forgiven him, neither in this World,
neither in the World to come.</hi> By which words <hi>Chriſt</hi> evidently ſuppoſes,
that (though <hi>theſe</hi> ſhall not) yet ſome ſins are forgiven in the <hi>World to
come:</hi> Which ſince it cannot be in <hi>Heaven,</hi> where no <hi>ſin</hi> enters; nor in
<hi>Hell,</hi> whence there is no Redemption; it muſt neceſſarily be ſome <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate:</hi>
And in this ſenſe it was underſtood by St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> nigh twelve
hundred Years ago, as is manifeſt in his Works. (<hi>Civ. Dei. l.</hi> 21. <hi>c.</hi> 13,
&amp; 24. <hi>&amp; lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cont. Julian. c.</hi> 15.) ſo alſo by St. <hi>Bernard</hi> againſt the Hereticks of his time. In the
ſame manner does St. <hi>Gregory the Great, (L.</hi> 4.
<hi>Diacl. c.</hi> 39.) ſo by St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> underſtand thoſe words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
(1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 15.) <hi>He himſelf ſhall be ſaved: yet ſo as by fire.</hi> Where he thinks
him to ſpeak of a <hi>purging fire, (Aug. in Pſal.</hi> 37.) So the ſame <hi>Father</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands
that <hi>Priſon</hi> of which St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks, (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 19.) to be ſome
place of <hi>Temporal Chaſtiſement, (Aug. Ep.</hi> 99.) And if this great <hi>Doctor</hi>
of the Church in thoſe Purer times, found ſo often in the Bible, <hi>a Place of
Pains, after this Life,</hi> from whence there was <hi>Releaſe;</hi> how can any one
ſay, without great preſumption, that the Being of a <hi>Third Place,</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God?</hi> Neither can the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of this Doctrine be
more juſtly call'd in queſtion, of which is found ſo early mention, not
only by this Holy Father; but even by others his Predeceſſors, the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of the Apoſtles, and the beſt <hi>Witneſſes</hi> of their Doctrine, (<hi>Dionyſ.
l. de Eccl. Hier. c.</hi> 7. <hi>In Actis SS. Perpet. &amp; Felicit.</hi> mention'd and approv'd

and many others quoted at length by the Learned <hi>Natalis Alexand. Tom.</hi>
9. <hi>Hiſt. Eccl. diſſert.</hi> 41.) And as for the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of this <hi>Tenet,</hi> he is bound
to think it does not want it, ſince he finds it abetted by ſuch Virtuous,
Learned and Conſidering Men, whom he dares not reckon <hi>Fools;</hi> never
hearing, that theſe us'd to <hi>Believe,</hi> but upon very good Grounds and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55205:23"/>
Reaſons. And he thinks he is able to give ſome himſelf, by what
he has learn'd from the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and theſe <hi>Fathers.</hi> For having been
taught by theſe; <hi>Firſt,</hi> That when a ſinner is reconcil'd to God, though
the <hi>Eternal Puniſhment</hi> due to his ſins, is always remitted, yet there
ſometimes remains a <hi>Temporal Penalty</hi> to be undergone. As in the caſe of
the <hi>Iſraelites, (Num.</hi> 14.) who by <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Prayers obtain'd Pardon for
their <hi>Murmuring,</hi> and yet were excluded the <hi>Land of Canaan.</hi> As in the
Caſe of <hi>David,</hi> (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.) who was puniſh'd in the loſs of his <hi>Child,</hi>
after his <hi>ſin</hi> was <hi>forgiven. Secondly,</hi> That there are ſome ſins, which of
their own nature are <hi>Light and Venial,</hi> ſuch as <hi>cool</hi> the fervour of <hi>Charity,</hi>
but do not <hi>extinguiſh</hi> it, from which even <hi>Holy</hi> Men are not exempt, and
of which it is ſaid, that the <hi>Juſt Man falls ſeven times, (Auguſtin. Enchir.
c.</hi> 70. <hi>&amp; lib. Quaeſt, Oct. tr.</hi> 9. 26.) <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That to all ſins, whether
great or ſmall, ſome <hi>Penalty</hi> is due to the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God; who as he has
<hi>Mercy</hi> to forgive, has alſo <hi>Juſtice</hi> to puniſh: ſo that as St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſays,
(in <hi>Enarr. in Pſal.</hi> 50. <hi>Whoſoever ſeeks to God for mercy, must remember
that he is juſt, and that his ſin ſhall not paſs unpuniſhed. Fourthly,</hi> That ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
ſpeaking, few Men depart out of this life, but either with the
guilt of ſome light offences and <hi>venial ſins,</hi> or elſe obnoxious to ſome
<hi>Temporal Puniſhment</hi> due to former ſins forgiven. From theſe Heads,
Diſcourſe leads him immediately to the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of ſome <hi>Third Place.</hi>
For ſince the <hi>Infinite Goodneſs</hi> of God can admit nothing into Heaven,
which is not <hi>clean,</hi> and pure from all ſin both <hi>great and ſmall:</hi> And his
<hi>Infinite Juſtice</hi> can permit none to receive the <hi>Reward</hi> of <hi>Bliſs,</hi> who as
yet are not out of <hi>debt,</hi> but have ſomething in <hi>Juſtice</hi> to <hi>ſuffer:</hi> There
muſt of neceſſity be ſome <hi>Place or State,</hi> where Souls, departing this
life, pardon'd as to the <hi>Eternal Guilt or Pain,</hi> yet obnoxious to ſome
<hi>Temporal Penalty,</hi> or with the guilt of ſome <hi>venial faults,</hi> are <hi>Purg'd and
Purify'd</hi> before their Admittance into <hi>Heaven.</hi> And this is what he is
taught concerning <hi>Purgatory.</hi> Which, though he knows not, <hi>Where it
is; of what nature the Pains are, or how long each Soul is detained there?</hi>
yet he believes, that thoſe, that are in this Place, being the <hi>Living
Members</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, are reliev'd by the <hi>Prayers</hi> of their Fellow-Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
here on Earth, and that the <hi>Charitable Works</hi> perform'd upon their
Death-bed, and the Alms diſpos'd on in their <hi>Laſt Will,</hi> are very avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
afterwards in order to their ſpeedier <hi>releaſe.</hi>

Does any one think that thoſe <hi>Holy Women,</hi> who follow'd their <hi>Lord,</hi> in

The like <hi>Faith</hi> alſo is ſufficient to fill him with Devotion, when he
is preſent at the Holy <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the <hi>Maſs:</hi> For believing, that Chriſt is
there <hi>really preſent</hi> before him, under the Species of <hi>Bread and Wine,</hi> and
that <hi>He</hi> that lies upon the Altar, is the <hi>Lamb of God that takes away the

plainly, <hi>Let your Talk be courteous,

This he is taught to obſerve

And Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> XI, in a Decree iſſued forth the Second of <hi>March, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi>

So that, (with St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi>) he
doubts the Salvation of as many

at all to do it. However, if any are
found, that have been ſo neglectful

Repentance, with an humble confidence on the <hi>Merits</hi> and <hi>Paſſion</hi> of
<hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> he may hear their Prayers, ſhew them mercy, and give them
time to repent. Theſe are all the Promiſes can be given in this point;
and this, is what he ſees daily practic'd; And if ſome, by theſe means,
are preſerv'd from falling into deſpair, 'tis well; But as for any receiving
from hence, encouragement of coming into the <hi>like circumstances,</hi> he
thinks there's but little danger; eſpecially ſince there's nothing ſo often

to <hi>Evil,</hi> than Examples to <hi>Good;</hi> they therefore retire from it

<hi>Service</hi> of <hi>God</hi> their whole imploy, and the <hi>Salvation</hi> of their <hi>Souls</hi> their

nothing permitted that is likely to prove a diſturbance to Godlineſs, or

World: What can be ſaid, but that no <hi>State</hi> can ſecure any Man; and that
no ſuch proviſion can be made in order to a <hi>Holy Life,</hi> but it may be <hi>abus'd?</hi>
But yet he does not think that ſuch <hi>abuſes,</hi> and the viciouſneſs of ſome, can
be argument enough to any juſt and reaſonable Man, to condemn the <hi>whole,</hi>
and the <hi>Inſtitution</hi> it ſelf. Is not <hi>Marriage</hi> abus'd an infinite number of
ways, and many forc'd to embrace this ſtate, or at leaſt to accept of ſuch
particular Perſons contrary to their own choice and liking? Is there any
ſtate in this World, any Condition, Trade, Calling, Profeſſion, Degree,
or Dignity whatſoever, which is not abus'd by ſome? Are <hi>Churches</hi> exempt

it ſelf abus'd, and even the <hi>Mercy</hi> of <hi>God</hi> abus'd? If therefore there is
nothing ſo Sacred and Divine in the whole World, which wicked and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
Men do not pervert to their will deſigns, to the high diſhonour of
God, and their own Damnation: How can any one upon the meer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of ſome abuſes, paſs Sentence of Condemnation againſt a thing,
which otherwiſe is <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Holy?</hi> 'Tis an undeniable truth, that to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
a Life exempt, as much as can be, from the turmoils of the World;
and in a quiet retirement to Dedicate ones ſelf to the <hi>Service</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and
ſpend ones days in <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Contemplation,</hi> is a moſt commendable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking,

which, according to the 9th.
Article of the <hi>Apoſtles Creed,</hi> he
believes to be <hi>Holy;</hi> and this not
only in <hi>Name,</hi> but alſo in <hi>Doctrine;</hi>
and for witneſs of her Sanctity, he
Appeals to her <hi>Councils, Catechiſms,
Pulpits,</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Books</hi> of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;
in which the main deſign
is, to imprint in the hearts of the
Faithful, this comprehenſive <hi>Maxim</hi>
of Chriſtianity; <hi>That they ought to
love God above all things, with their
whole Heart and Soul; and their

none flatter themſelves, with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence

without living <hi>Soberly, Juſtly,</hi> and
<hi>Piouſly;</hi> as 'tis in the Council of

thus <hi>Holily,</hi> and in the fear of God,
he knows 'tis too, too evident; there
being many in all places, wholly
forgetful of their Duty, giving
themſelves up to all ſorts of Vice,
and guilty of moſt horrid Crimes.
And tho' he is not bound to believe

Yet really thinks, that

ſcandalous in their Lives, wicked

Is the whole <hi>Church</hi> to be condemn'd
for the vicious Lives of ſome of her
<hi>Profeſſors;</hi> and her <hi>Doctrine</hi> to ſtand
guilty of an many Villanies as thoſe
commit, who neglect to follow it?
If ſo, let the Men of that <hi>Society,
Judgement,</hi> or <hi>Perſwaſion,</hi> who are
not in the like circumſtance, <hi>fling
the firſt ſtone.</hi> Certainly if this way
of paſſing Sentence, be once allow'd
as juſt and reaſonable, there never
was, nor ever will be, any <hi>Religion</hi> or <hi>Church</hi> of God upon the Earth. 'Tis
but reck'ning up the Idolatries, Superſtitions, Cruelties, Rebellions,
Murders of Princes, Impieties, and other ſuch like Enormites, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the <hi>Jews,</hi> as they ſtand Recorded in <hi>Scripture;</hi> and 'tis immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prov'd, that the <hi>Jews</hi> were never the <hi>choſen People</hi> of God, nor their
<hi>Law,</hi> the Dictates of Heaven. 'Tis but making a Liſt of the <hi>Miſdemean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,
Irregularities, Abuſes, Exceſſes, Treacheris, Simony, Seperation, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords,
Erroneous Doctrines,</hi> to be found, even in the time of the Apoſtles
and their Followers, and they are all effectually prov'd to be the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples

into Heaven, but his Apoſtles left him, and began to ſet up for Schiſm
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:55205:31"/>
and Vice. By this way, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> may be evidently condemn'd for an
<hi>Heathen,</hi> becauſe he murdered his Wife and his Son. And the <hi>Religion</hi> of
<hi>Theodoſius</hi> be mark'd out for <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> becauſe, by his Order, ſeven Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> were Treacherouſly Maſſacred in three hours ſpace, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
diſtinction of Sex or Age, or the Innocent from the Guilty. A <hi>confident</hi>
Undertaker would find no difficulty in proving all this; eſpecially if he
had but the <hi>Gift</hi> of <hi>exaggerating</hi> ſome things, <hi>miſ-repreſenting</hi> others, of
finding <hi>Authorities</hi> and <hi>Texts</hi> for every idle Story, of charging the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
Opinions of every <hi>ſingle Author,</hi> upon the <hi>Religion</hi> they profeſs,
of raking together all the Wickedneſs, Cruelties, Treacheries, Plots,
Conſpiracies, at any time committed, by any ambitious Deſperado's, or
wicked Villains: And then poſitively aſſerting, that what theſe did, was
according to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of that <hi>Church</hi> of which they were Members;
and that the true meaſures of the <hi>Sanctity</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> in
whoſe Communion theſe Men were, may be juſtly taken from the Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
of ſuch <hi>Offenders.</hi> But certainly no Man of Reaſon and Conſcience
can allow of ſuch Proceedings. No ſober Man would ever go to <hi>Tybourn,</hi>
and <hi>Whetſtones-Park,</hi> to know what is the <hi>Religion</hi> profeſſed in <hi>England</hi>
according to <hi>Law;</hi> Nor would look into all the Sinks, Jakes, Dung-hills,
Common-ſhores about Town, from ſuch a Proſpect to give a true De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripion
of the City. Why therefore ſhould the Character of the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>Rome</hi> and her <hi>Doctrine</hi> be taken only from the looſe Behaviour and
wicked Crimes of ſuch, who, tho' in Communion with her, yet live not
according to her Direction? She teaches Holineſs of Life, Mercy to the
Poor, Loyalty and Obedience to Princes, and the neceſſity of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Commandments,</hi> (witneſs the many Books of Devotion and Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
made <hi>Engliſh</hi> for Publick benefit, written originally by <hi>Papiſts,</hi>) and
great numbers there are (God be prais'd) who practice this in their Lives.
And now if there be many alſo, who ſtop their Ears to good Inſtruction,
and following the Suggeſtion of their own ungovern'd appetites, of Pride,
Ambition, Covetouſneſs, Luxury, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo lay aſide all concern of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and become unchriſtian both to God and their Neighbour, that they
are a ſhame to their <hi>Profeſſion:</hi> Why ſhould the <hi>Church</hi> be repreſented
according to the <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> of thoſe that neglect her <hi>Doctrine;</hi> and not
rather by the Piety and Exemplar Lives of ſuch as follow it? Is not this
to deal by her, (if we may uſe ſuch a Compariſon) as 'tis generally done
by the <hi>Sign</hi> of St. <hi>Dunſtan,</hi> near <hi>Temple-Bar,</hi> (on which, tho' the <hi>Saint</hi> be
drawn almoſt in the <hi>full proportion,</hi> and there's no more of the <hi>Devil</hi> on
it, beſides the <hi>reaching</hi> towards him with a pair of <hi>Tongs;</hi>) yet 'tis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd
only by the name of the <hi>Devil-Tavern,</hi> without the leaſt mention
of the <hi>Saint?</hi> And is not this <hi>partiality</hi> unjuſt, and theſe <hi>piece-meal</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:55205:32"/>
unreaſonable? Let the <hi>Character</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> be given accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to what ſhe teaches, and not according to the <hi>Writings</hi> of every <hi>poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Opiniator,</hi> and the <hi>Practices</hi> of every wicked Liver, and then there's no
fear of its coming out ſo <hi>ugly</hi> and <hi>deform'd.</hi> Neither let any one pretend
to demonſtrate the <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Principles</hi> of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> by the Works of
every <hi>Divine</hi> in that <hi>Communion;</hi> or by the <hi>Actions</hi> of every <hi>Biſhop, Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi>
or <hi>Pope;</hi> For they extend not their <hi>Faith</hi> beyond the <hi>Declarations</hi> of
<hi>General-Councils:</hi> And ſtanding faſt to theſe, they yet own, that many of
their <hi>Writers</hi> are too looſe in their <hi>Opinions,</hi> that all <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Cardinals</hi>
are not ſo edifying as becomes their State; and that <hi>Popes</hi> may have their
failings too. A <hi>Pope</hi> is a Temporal Prince, keeps a Court, has variety of
Officers about him. And if he has <hi>Flatterers,</hi> and <hi>Miſ-informers</hi> too, 'tis
nothing but what all Princes are ſenſible of, but cannot remedy. And hence
he doubts not, but 'tis poſſible that he may be engag'd in unlawful under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings,
and invite others to the like. And are not all other Princes ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to this too? But what then? Theſe Actions of <hi>Popes</hi> concern not the
<hi>Faith</hi> of thoſe who are in Communion with them; they may throw a
ſcandal indeed upon the <hi>Religion,</hi> but they can never alter its <hi>Creed.</hi> But
what need any other return to the numerous Clamours made daily againſt

brands them with the infamous Title of Men <hi>depart from the Faith gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

concerning the Truth erred</hi> only in one Point, <hi>ſaying that the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

now taught him by his Church, is nothing but what ſhe has learnt
from St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles; it being deliver'd by them
that he is a <hi>Lyar who denieth that Jeſus is the Chriſt,</hi> (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 22.)
And <hi>that every ſpirit that confeſſes not, that Jeſus Chriſt, is come in the
fleſh, is not of God, (ib. c.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 3.) And not only this, but likewiſe
<hi>A man that is an Heretick, after the firſt and ſecond admonition, reject;
knowing that he that is ſuch, is ſubverted and ſinneth, being condemned of
himſelf, (Tit.</hi> 3. 10, 11.) With this weighty advice to the <hi>Brethren,</hi> in
which they are commanded <hi>in the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to
ſpeak, all the ſame thing, that there be no diviſions among them, but that
they be perfectly joined together in the ſame mind and in the ſame judgment,</hi>
(1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 10.) For that having <hi>ſtrife and diviſions among them, they
will ſhew themſelves to be Carnal, and to walk as Men, (ib. c.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 3.)
That therefore, there <hi>being but one Body, and one Spirit, one Lord,
one Faith, and one Baptiſm, they ſhould endeavour to keep the Unity
of the Spirit, in the Bond of Peace, and not be toſſed to and fro like
Children, and carryed about with every Wind of Doctrin, by the ſlight
of men, and cunning Craftineſs, whereby they lye in wait to deceive,
(Epheſ. c.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4, 5, 14.) <hi>Who transforming themſelves into the
Apoſtles of Chriſt, are falſe Apoſtles, deceitfull Workers,</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11,
13.) But certainly <hi>accurſed,</hi> for that <hi>troubling the Faithful, they
would pervert the Goſpel of Chriſt, and preach another Goſpel, than
that which had bin preach'd by the Apoſtles, (Gal.</hi> 1. 7, 8.) And this
is the Sum of the Doctrin of his Church, which believing that Faith is
neceſſary to Salvation, it being <hi>impoſſible whithout Faith to pleaſe God,
(Heb.</hi> 11. 6.) teaches likewiſe, that the <hi>Faithful</hi> ought to hold faſt the
profeſſion of their Faith without <hi>wavering,</hi> for that not only they loſe
it, who deny <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to be God, as ſome have done: but alſo all

Faith obſtinately deny, or teach otherwiſe than was taught by <hi>Chriſt</hi>
and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> as <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus</hi> did: ſo that, that Chriſtian
makes but a very imperfect and lame profeſſion of his Faith, who can
only ſay, <hi>I believe that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh, and that he is God
and Man, the Redeemer of the world:</hi> unleſs he can with truth add this
likewiſe, <hi>I alſo believe the whole Goſpel that he preach'd, and every point
of Faith, that he has taught and deliver'd to us by his Apoſtles:</hi> there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſame Obligation to obey his Precepts, and hearken to his
Words, as to acknowledge the Divinity of his Perſon; and it being a
ſin of the ſame blackneſs, obſtinately to oppoſe any point of his <hi>Doctrine,</hi>
as to deny the truth of his <hi>Perſon.</hi> 'Tis not therefore any <hi>uncharitableneſs</hi>
in his Church, to declare plainly this miſerable unhappyſtate of all ſuch,
who wilfully <hi>oppoſe</hi> and <hi>ſeperate</hi> from the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of Chriſt, deliver'd

which Chriſt has Commanded all to hear and obey: But 'tis her Zeal
ſo to do, and the ſame ſolicitude for the ſalvation of Souls, which
mov'd the Apoſtles heretofore, to Preach the like Doctrine to their
Flock; as alſo the Primitive Chriſtians to expel their Communion,
and Anathematize all ſuch, who by broaching erroneous Tenets, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to any point of Receiv'd Doctrine, or by diſobedience, did wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<hi>divide</hi> themſelves from the <hi>Belief</hi> or <hi>Diſcipline</hi> of the <hi>Catholick
Church:</hi> Such as were <hi>Marcion, Baſilides</hi> and <hi>Bardeſanes,</hi> who were
Condemn'd in the Firſt Age, for oppoſing that Article of our Faith, in
which we believe the <hi>Reſurrection of the Dead;</hi> ſuch the <hi>Archonticks,</hi>
Condemn'd likewiſe for denying the <hi>neceſſity of Baptiſm:</hi> Such <hi>Tatianus</hi>
&amp;c. for Preaching <hi>Marriage to be unlawful.</hi> Such the <hi>Millenarians,</hi> for
maintaining a thouſand Years Reign of Chriſt upon Earth, with his
Saints in ſenſual pleaſures. And ſo in all Ages others were condemn'd
upon the like account. It having been always, a received Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom,
even in the pureſt time of the Goſpel, for the Elders and
Prelates, to whoſe charge Chriſt committed the care of his Flock, to
oppoſe all thoſe that by new Doctrin, or by making <hi>Schiſms and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions,</hi>
did diſturb its peace: and not to permit any that by ſuch like
means did endeavour to deſtroy his Unity, ſo much deſired and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
by the Apoſtles. So that they were equally declar'd Enemies
of Chriſtianity, who denyed Chriſt; and they, who confeſſing Chriſt,
did yet contradict and reject any part of his Doctrin. And this upon
the Principle, that <hi>Chriſtian Faith ought to be entire.</hi> For that every
Article, Myſtery and Point of it being deliver'd by the ſame hands,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:55205:40"/>
and recommended by the ſame <hi>Authority,</hi> whoſoever did oppoſe any one
Point of it, was immediately judg'd guilty of all, in diſcrediting the
<hi>Authority,</hi> on which the whole ſtood equally grounded. And this is
that great Truth proclaimed above thirteen hundred years ago, and
now every where read in St. <hi>Athanaſius's Creed. Whoſoever will be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
before all things it is neceſſary that he hold the Catholick Faith. Which
Faith, except every one do keep Whole and undefiled; without doubt, he
ſhall periſh everlaſtingly.</hi> By which words was made known to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
World, the Senſe and Doctrine of the then pure and unſpotted
Church, as receiv'd from Chriſt and his Apoſtles. That it is in vain
for any one to hope for Salvation, unleſs he firſt believe the <hi>Catholick
Faith;</hi> and that whoſoever does not believe <hi>it Whole and Undefiled,</hi>
ſhall certainly periſh everlaſtingly. Which is a Doctrin like that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
by the Apoſtle, concerning the obſervance of the Laws of
God; that as whoſoever <hi>fails in one, is made guilty of all;</hi> ſo alſo, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
disbelieves one Article of the Catholick Faith, does in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
disbelieve all. There being no more hopes of Salvation for one
that denies obſtinately any <hi>one</hi> Point of the Catholick Faith, tho'
he believes all the reſt; than there is for one, who keeps <hi>Nine</hi> of the
Commandments; with the Breach of the <hi>Tenth.</hi> An obſtinate oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
againſt one Point of Faith, and a ſin againſt one Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
being as certainly damnable, as if 'twere againſt <hi>all.</hi> There
being the ſame reaſon, and an equal neceſſity that the Obſervance of
God's Law, and the Aſſent to the Catholick Faith be <hi>alike entire</hi> and
<hi>Whole.</hi> And now being convinc'd, that none can believe to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but he that embraces the Catholick Faith thus <hi>wholly</hi> and <hi>entirely,</hi>
by an equal ſubmiſſion to all the <hi>Myſteries</hi> contain'd in it, without op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to any. And being likewiſe convinc'd, that no one can ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
to the true knowledg of this Faith, with an aſſurance of its <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity,</hi>
but by receiving it as propos'd and believ'd by the <hi>Church of Chriſt;</hi>
Which <hi>Church</hi> was founded by the Son of God, watred with his
Bloud, and by an infallible aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt (by which it
was to be taught all Truth to the end of the World) was ſecur'd from
the danger of being deceiv'd or deceiving others, to the conſummation
of things: he does not doubt, but as in the Apoſtles time, ſo alſo ever
ſince, and at preſent, <hi>God addeth to this Church daily ſuch as ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
(Acts</hi> 2. 47.) there being no <hi>entire faith</hi> neceſſary to Salvation, to
be found out of this <hi>Church;</hi> and no poſſibility, as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſays, that
<hi>God</hi> ſhall be a <hi>Father</hi> to any, who own not <hi>this Church</hi> for his <hi>Mother.</hi>
But now, <hi>where</hi> and <hi>which</hi> this <hi>Church</hi> is, and what Society of Men
are Members of it, among ſuch variety of Pretenders; though it
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:55205:40"/>
may ſeem a great difficulty to ſome to diſtinguiſh; yet to him it is none
at all; for ſince there is no other Church, beſides the <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi>
which has had a continued and viſible Succeſſion of Biſhops
and Paſtors in all Ages ſince the Apoſtles; no other that has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
Infidel Nations to Chriſtianity: no other that has always preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v'd
Peace and Unity amongſt its Members, all of them ſpeaking the
ſame thing, and being perfectly join'd together in the ſame mind, and
the ſame judgment; no other that by aſſembling the Elders and Prelates,
has oppos'd in all ages Hereſies and Schiſms, and condemn'd all thoſe,
who not ſparing the Flock, have ſpoken perverſe things, endeavouring
to draw away diſciples after them, no other, that has, in obedience to
the command of Chriſt, ſend Apoſtles amongſt Infidels and Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
for the preaching to them the Goſpel, and inſtructing them in
Chriſtianity, and by this way, without Arms or blood, have ſpread
their Faith throughout the World: No other, that by evident and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable
Miracles, have prov'd the truth of her Doctrin: No other but
what has begun by <hi>ſeperation,</hi> whoſe firſt Preachers have <hi>gone out</hi> from
this; the time of their firſt Preaching, and ſhewing themſelves to the
World, being upon Record, and their new Doctrine cenſur'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
by that Church, from whence they <hi>ſeparated.</hi> Since, I ſay, there's
no other Society or Chriſtian Congregation in the World, to which
theſe certain Marks of the Church of Chriſt, does agree; 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to him, that this is the only true Church; that whoſoever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
any Article of her Faith, denies ſo much of Chriſt's Doctrin;
that whoſoever hears her, hears Chriſt; and whoſoever obſtinately

her, every one in her Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

the Particulars thus appointed or
commanded, be not to be found in
Scripture: Yet there being in the
Scripture, an expreſs and abſolute
command given to the whole
Flock of Chriſt, of following and
being obedient to thoſe, that have
thus order'd theſe things, in virtue
of that command they voluntarily,
and without conſtraint, accept all
that is of their appointment: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
excepting againſt any thing,

this they look on, as a Chriſtian

are, by God's Pleaſure, in ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

a Servant having receiv'd a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

Precept of <hi>Servants being Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient

perform the Will of their Parents,
upon the Command, <hi>Obey thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

the Ordinances and Conſtitutions
of their Paſtors and Prelates, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

ground for this their Submiſſion
and Obedience, that God has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them a General Command;
<hi>Obey them that have the rule over
you, and ſubmit your ſelves: for they
watch for your Souls, as they that
muſt give account, (Heb.</hi> 13. 17.)
<hi>Remember them which have the rule over you, who have ſpoken to you the
Word of God, whoſe Faith follow, (Heb.</hi> 13. 7.) So that to them it
ſeems a very fallacious rule, leading to all confuſion and unchriſtian
contentions, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Higher Powers, our Superiors, Paſtors
and Prelates, are not to be obey'd, but only in ſuch things as are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
in Scripture; and as for any other particulars, whoſoever upon
examination, cannot find what is commanded by them in <hi>Holy Writ;</hi>
may lawfully refuſe ſubmiſſion; nay, he is oblig'd to reſiſt. For
however this ſeems to bear much of the Word of God in the face of
it, yet certainly 'tis wholly deſtructive to it; and under pretence of
adhering cloſe to the Scripture, undermines the very Author of it.
This the Primitive Chriſtians underſtood ſo well, that they deteſted
all ſuch Maxims, and following the Advice of the Apoſtle, choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to truſt their Souls in the hands of thoſe, whom God had plac'd
over them, by an humble Submiſſion to the Government; and a pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable
Obedience to their Decrees; than by a preſumptuous queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of every thing, and raiſing vain diſputes, to take the <hi>Rule</hi> of the
Flock out of the hands of thoſe, to whom God had providentially deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
it, and place themſelves Judges over the Church, their Elders
Prelates and Paſtors, whom God had commanded them to hear, and
be in Subjection to. So that we never read, that they ever preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to weigh the Ordinances of their Superiors by their own reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
or to bring them to the Teſt of the Word of God, before the
acceptance; but alway judg'd it conform to the Word of God, that their
<hi>Governours</hi> ſhould <hi>Rule,</hi> and they <hi>Obey.</hi> Thus when the Apoſtles ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
the <hi>Sunday</hi> inſtead of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and met together at <hi>Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt;</hi>
we don't read that the Faithful then began to turn over their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
to find a Command for theſe particulars, but with a prompt Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
readily followed them in the Obſervance. So when Abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
from Bloud and Strangled Meats, was order'd by the Elders Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:55205:42"/>
at <hi>Jeruſalem; (Acts</hi> 15.) the multitude of Believers having
heard the Decree, never murmur'd at it, or call'd it into queſtion,
however ſeemingly contrary to the intention of Chriſt, who in abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> was thought to have cut off all theſe Obligations;
but they all <hi>rejoiced for the Conſolation, (ib. v.</hi> 31.) So when St. <hi>Paul</hi> gave
orders to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> (1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.) in what manner and poſture,
they were to behave themſelves at Prayers in their Aſſemblies, both
Men and Women; we don't hear, that he was challeng'd by any, to ſhew
by what authority of Scripture he thus reprov'd and preſcrib'd in theſe
particulars, or by what they were oblig'd to receive his Preſcriptions;
but with a prompt ſubmiſſion accepted his Orders, not doubting, but
ſince it was God's Will to place <hi>Rulers</hi> and <hi>Governours</hi> over them, it
muſt be God's Will that they ſhould be obedient to them, in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Decrees, and obſerving their Conſtitutions. And with this
Doctrin of Obedience, Humility and Submiſſion all the Primitive
Chriſtians were train'd up by the Apoſtles, who zealouſly laboured by
this means, to preſerve them in peace and Unity; that ſo they might think
all the ſame thing, and be of one mind and one judgment and without
Diviſions: inſomuch, that there is not any one thing ſo often repeated
in their Writings, as Exhortations to this Obedience and Submiſſion:
See, how, going <hi>through the cities, they deliver'd to them</hi> (the Faithful)
<hi>the decrees for to keep, that were ordain'd by the Apoſtles and Elders which
were at Jeruſalem, (Acts</hi> 16. 4.) See how St. <hi>Paul</hi> commands the
<hi>Theſſalonians, to hold faſt the traditions, they had been taught by word, or by
Epiſtle,</hi> (2 Theſſ. 2. 15.) See how he comands the <hi>Hebrews; Obey
them, that have the rule over you, Remember them, which have the rule
over you,</hi> (Heb. 13. 7. 17.) See with what earneſtneſs St. <hi>John</hi> urges
this; <hi>He that knoweth God heareth us, he that is not of God heareth us not,</hi>
(1 Joh. 4. 6.) <hi>hereby, know we the ſpirit of truth, and the ſpirit of errour.</hi>
And then again, does not St. <hi>Paul</hi> commend the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for their
Obedience; <hi>Now I praiſe you, Brethren, that you remember me in all things,
and keep the Ordinances, as I deliver'd them to you,</hi> (1 Cor. 11. 2.) And
then, having given them directions as to their behaviour in their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies,
he adds; <hi>But if any man ſeem to be contentious, We have no ſuch
cuſtom, neither the Churches of God,</hi> (1 Cor. 11. 16.) And now it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus evident, that the Church of Chriſt in the Apoſtles time was
founded, and preſerv'd by a Submiſſion and Obedience of the Flock to
their Paſtors; the <hi>Papiſts</hi> teach and believe; that, what was taught
and commanded by the Apoſtles to the Faithful then living, ought to
be receiv'd, as a Doctrin neceſſary for all ſucceeding Ages, and that
Submiſſion and Obedience ought to have been as much the Duty of
Believers, ever ſince, as it was then; the Commands and Practice of that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:55205:42"/>
time, being undoubtedly the beſt, and only Pattern for the Faithful for all
times, even to the End of the World. And they do not only teach this
Doctrine of Submiſſion in their Books and Sermons, but alſo obſerve it in
their Lives, having in all Ages depended on their Elders and Prelates in
all matters touching the Diſcipline and Goverment of the Church; lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>Rule</hi> to thoſe, whoſe Charge and Office it is to <hi>Rule;</hi> and never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
that they, who are under Charge and Command expreſly by Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Remember</hi> and <hi>Obey</hi> thoſe who have the <hi>Rule</hi> over them, can upon
any pretence whatſoever, nay, tho' an Angel from Heaven ſhould come and
Preach otherwiſe, be diſcharg'd from this Chriſtian Obligation, and be
exempted from <hi>Remembring</hi> and <hi>Obeying,</hi> whom thus by God, ſpeaking by
his Apoſtle, they are Commanded to <hi>Remember</hi> and <hi>Obey.</hi> And upon this
ground it is, that in things concerning the <hi>Order</hi> to be obſerv'd in the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Service,</hi> in all <hi>Ceremonies, Holy Rites, Eccleſiaſtical Conſti<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>utions,</hi> and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,</hi>
they have neither <hi>Nill</hi> nor <hi>Will</hi> of their own; but always receive,
and think that the <hi>beſt,</hi> which is Order'd and Appointed by thoſe, to
whom, by <hi>Divine Law,</hi> they owe <hi>this Submiſſion and Obedience,</hi> and to whom
the Ordering and Appointing theſe things, appertains. And therefore if
theſe appoint a Day of <hi>Humiliation,</hi> for imploring God's Mercy, or aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his Judgements, they never ſcruple to obſerve it; if a day of <hi>Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving</hi>
in memory of ſome ſignal Benefit, they likewiſe Obey. If theſe judge
it fit, that on every <hi>Friday</hi> ſhould be commemorated the Death and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of our Redeemer in <hi>Fasting;</hi> and command <hi>Lent</hi> to be obſerv'd, in
remembrance and imitation of our Lord's forty days Faſt in the Deſart,
they think it their obligation to do ſo. If theſe order ſuch and ſuch days
to be ſet apart, and kept Holy in Remembrance and Thanksgiving for the
<hi>Incarnation, Nativity, Circumciſion, Reſurrection,</hi> and <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
and for other ſuch like intentions, they eſteem it ſinful to oppoſe it. If
theſe judge it decent that the Faithful ſhould <hi>bow</hi> at the Name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi>
ſtand at the reading of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> proſtrate, or incline themſelves at the
<hi>Confeſſion.</hi> If they appoint <hi>Tapers</hi> and <hi>Lamps</hi> to be uſed in <hi>Churches,</hi> to
repreſent our Saviour, who came to enlighten the World; and <hi>Incenſe</hi> to
be uſed, to mind the people, that their Hearts and Prayers, ſhould, like the
Smoak, aſcend directly toward Heaven: If in the Adminiſtration of the
<hi>Sacraments,</hi> in <hi>Exorciſms,</hi> in the <hi>Offices,</hi> and the Celebration of the <hi>Maſs,</hi>
theſe determine ſeveral <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> to be obſerv'd, for more <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,</hi>
greater <hi>Solemnity,</hi> and that by ſuch exteriour helps, the minds of
the Faithful may be mov'd to the contemplation of the <hi>Sacred Myſteries,</hi>
and rais'd more ſenſibly to the apprehenſion of the Majeſty of God, in
whoſe Honour all is perform'd; they look upon themſelves bound to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
and embrace all theſe things without reluctance or oppoſition; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:55205:43"/>
thinking, that to be moſt proper, which is inſtituted by ſuch, who
have the <hi>Rule</hi> over them. And if any endeavour to raiſe Diſputes, and be
contentious concerning the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of theſe Inſtitutions, <hi>they have no ſuch
Cuſtom, neither the Churches of God.</hi> One thing they know to be neceſſary,
that is, that they ſhould be <hi>Obedient;</hi> and that in the Service of God, they
muſt not honour him as the <hi>Jews</hi> did, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 13. by <hi>doing their own ways,
finding their own pleaſure, and speaking their own words;</hi> but as Chriſtians
are Commanded, in a true <hi>Self-denyal,</hi> a ſincere <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi>
ſubmitting to thoſe whom God has left to rule and govern the Flock.
Neither is there any danger of falling back into the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
the allow'd Ceremonies of the Church; it being certain, that in
the Abrogation of the Old Law, all Ceremonies were not at the ſame time
extinct: But only ſuch as were meer <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi> of things to come
in the New Law, which are now fulfill'd: Whilſt others, (fit for the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
Devotion, and expreſſing the affections of the Soul, and other ſuch
ends,) are ſtill commendably retain'd as lawful, and equally neceſſary now,
as heretofore: ſuch are, <hi>Kneeling, Fasting, lifting Hands and Eyes to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
Sighing, knocking the Breaſt, days of Humiliation, Thanksgiving, Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Hair-cloth, Singing, Impoſitions of Hands, Benedictions, uſing Oyl, Spittle,
Breathing, &amp;c.</hi> all which are as lawful, convenient and neceſſary for <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtans,</hi>
as they were for <hi>Jews;</hi> and no more to be neglected, becauſe they
were us'd in the <hi>Old Law,</hi> than praying, meeting, Reading the Law, Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Pſalms, Humility, and Obedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are to be laid by, and diſown'd
by <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> becauſe they were obſerved by the <hi>Jews.</hi> Eſpecially, ſince
theſe, with many others, have been recommended to us by the practice of
Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and of all Primitive Chriſtianity. Neither has the
uſe of Holy Ceremonies been wholly diſ-approved by thoſe of the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</hi>
The <hi>Engliſh Profeſſion</hi> of Faith, publiſh'd in the year 1562. allows
them in the 34th Article. The <hi>Bohemick Confeſſion</hi> in the 15th Article,
<hi>Anno</hi> 1537. The <hi>Auguſtine, Tit. de Miſſ. Anno</hi> 1530. as it was penn'd by
<hi>Melancthon.</hi> So that ſince <hi>Ceremonies</hi> are generally look'd on as commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
and lawful amongſt Chriſtians; the Papiſts judge it proper to thoſe
who have the <hi>Rule,</hi> to Order and Diſpoſe of them, and declare to the
Flock, <hi>how, when, and where</hi> they are to be obſerved. And if they who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern,
judge fit to oblige the Faithful to the obſervance of any in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
they teach that it is the Duty of the Flock, to Obey. Things <hi>indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,</hi>
after ſuch Commands, being no longer of <hi>choice</hi> but <hi>neceſſary;</hi> and
no leſs <hi>obliging,</hi> than the Commands of a Father to his Child; where, in

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:55205:43"/>
Natural, Eccleſiaſtical or Civil, to perform and comply with ſuch
things, as they judge in their own private Sentiments, <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nneceſſary,</hi> meerly
upon the account of being <hi>Commanded,</hi> than upon ſuch conſiderations,
to diſturb the order of Government, and fly in the Face of Lawful Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
than which nothing is more oppoſite to the Principles of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
and deſtructive of all Humane Society. And upon theſe grounds it
is, that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> founding themſelves upon the ſure foundation of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility</hi>
and <hi>Obedience,</hi> have in all Ages acknowledged <hi>Overſeers</hi> and <hi>Rulers
over them to watch and feed the Flock,</hi> to whom God hath given <hi>Power;

                        <p>HIS Church has never made any
<hi>Innovation</hi> in Matters of <hi>Faith;</hi>
what ſhe believes and teaches now,
being the ſame that the <hi>Catholick
Church</hi> believ'd and taught, in the
firſt three or four Centuries after the
Apoſtles. And tho' in moſt of her
<hi>General Councils</hi> there has been ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Deciſions touching Points of
Faith; Yet can no one, without an
injury to truth, ſay, that in any of
theſe has been coin'd <hi>new Articles,</hi> or
Chriſtians forced to the acceptance
of <hi>Novelties,</hi> contrary to the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
or antient <hi>Tradition.</hi> Theſe have
only trodden in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſteps;
as often as they have been in the like
circumſtances with them; doing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
according to the Form and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
left to the Church, by thoſe
perfect Maſters of Chriſtianity. And
therefore as the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,
<hi>Acts</hi> 15. determin'd the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie
concerning the <hi>Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;</hi>
and propoſed to the Faithful,
what was the Doctrine of Chriſt in
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:55205:44"/>
that point, of <hi>neceſſity</hi> to be believ'd;
of which till that deciſion, there had
been rais'd ſeveral Queſtions and
Doubts; but now no longer to be
queſtioned, without the Shipwrack
of Faith. So in all ſucceeding ages
the Elders of the Church, to whom
the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> left their Commiſſion of
<hi>watching over the Flock,</hi> in their <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils</hi>
have never ſcrupled to determine
all ſuch Points, which had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted
amongſt the Brethren, and
to propoſe to them, what of <hi>neceſſity</hi>
they were to believe for the future,
with <hi>Anathema</hi> pronounced againſt
all ſuch, as ſhould preſume to preach
the contrary. Thus in the year 325.
the firſt <hi>Nicene Council</hi> declar'd the
Son of God to be <hi>Conſubstantial</hi> to his <hi>Father,</hi> againſt the <hi>Arians;</hi> with
an obligation on all to aſſent to this Doctrine, though never till then, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
or declar'd in that Form. Thus in the year 381. the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> was
declar'd to be <hi>God;</hi> againſt <hi>Macedonius</hi> and his Followers, in the firſt <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinopolital
Council.</hi> And in the firſt <hi>Epheſin, Anno</hi> 431. <hi>Neſtorius</hi> was
condemned, who maintain'd <hi>two Perſons in Chriſt,</hi> and that the <hi>bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin</hi>
was not <hi>Mother of God;</hi> with a Declaration, that both theſe <hi>Tenets</hi>
were contrary to the <hi>Catholick Faith.</hi> In the ſecond <hi>Nicene Council. Anno</hi>
787. Image-breakers were Anathematiz'd. And ſo others at other times;
and at laſt, in the <hi>Council of Trent,</hi> was declar'd the <hi>Real Preſence, Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation,
Purgatory, the lawfulneſs of the Invocation of Saints, of keeping Holy
Images, &amp;c.</hi> againſt <hi>Luther Calvin, Beza, &amp;c.</hi> And now, though in all theſe,
and the other <hi>General Councils,</hi> the perſons condemned, took occaſion, from
theſe <hi>New Declarations,</hi> to cry out, <hi>Novelties, Novelties,</hi> to fright the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
with the noiſe of <hi>new coin'd Articles,</hi> and that the <hi>inventions of Men</hi>
were impos'd on them, for <hi>Faith.</hi> Yet 'tis evident, that theſe <hi>New Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi>
contain'd nothing but the <hi>Antient Faith;</hi> and that there had never
been any ſuch <hi>Declarations</hi> made, had not the Doctrine propos'd in them,
being oppos'd and contradicted by ſome ſeducing Spirits, who going out
from the Flock, endeavour'd by making Diviſions, to draw numbers after
them. So that the <hi>new Propoſal</hi> of a Tenet, is but a <hi>fallacious</hi> proof of the
Doctrine being <hi>lately invented,</hi> but a <hi>good Argument</hi> of its being <hi>lately op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd.</hi>
'Tis certain from <hi>Scripture, Act.</hi> 15. that the Apoſtles had never
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:55205:44"/>
declar'd the <hi>non-neceſſity of Circumciſion,</hi> had not certain men come down
from <hi>Judea</hi> and taught the Brethren the contrary. And that <hi>Conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiality</hi>
of the Son, had never been defin'd by the <hi>Nicene Fathers,</hi> had not
<hi>Arius,</hi> with his Followers, oppos'd this <hi>Catholick Doctrine.</hi> And as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it is, that the <hi>Council of Trent</hi> had been altogether ſilent as to <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation,
Praying to Saints, Purgatory, &amp;c.</hi> had not <hi>Luther, Calvin,</hi> and
their Diſciples, once profeſſors of this Doctrine, <hi>gone out</hi> from the <hi>Flock,</hi>
and upon the preſumption of a <hi>New Light,</hi> endeavour'd to perſwade the
Faithful, that theſe Tenets, then believ'd by the whole <hi>Chriſtian</hi> World,
were no longer to be own'd, but to be quite thrown by, as <hi>Antichristian</hi>
and <hi>Diabolical.</hi> 'Twas this oblig'd the <hi>Paſtors</hi> to watch and take care
of their Flock; and therefore not flying away, as the <hi>Hireling</hi> does, when
the <hi>Wolf catcheth, and ſcattereth the Sheep,</hi> they aſſembled together in a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and declar'd to all under their charge, that they ought not to follow
ſtrangers; that howſoever theſe came pretending to the <hi>Shepherd's voice;</hi>
yet ſince they <hi>came not by the dore into the Sheepfold, but climbing up ſome other
way, they were no Shepherds, but Thieves and Robbers;</hi> ſuch whoſe buſineſs
was not to feed, but to ſteal, kill and deſtroy. 'Twas this made them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
all under their care, not to waver; but to ſtand faſt, and hold the
profeſſion of their Faith, and notwithſtanding all pretences, by no means
to ſuffer themſelves to be deluded, and led away with <hi>ſtrange Doctrine;</hi>
and that they might the better ſecure them from falling into <hi>Errours,</hi> they
gave them a Draught of their <hi>Chriſtian Doctrine;</hi> eſpecially of all thoſe
points, which theſe <hi>modern ſelf-commiſſionated Apoſtles</hi> did preach againſt,
and endeavour to undermine; particularly declaring to them, the Faith
they had been bred up in, which they had receiv'd from their Forefathers,
and been deriv'd even from the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> Securing them, that whatſoever
was contrary to this, was <hi>Novelty</hi> and <hi>Errour.</hi> And now in the <hi>Paſtors</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
this to the <hi>Faithful,</hi> where was the <hi>Innovation?</hi> The <hi>Council</hi> did
nothing but propoſe fully and explicately, what, before their meeting, was
the Doctrine of all <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and had been ſo amongſt the <hi>Primitive
Fathers.</hi> 'Twas they made <hi>Innovation,</hi> who preach'd contrary to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
thus believ'd and receiv'd; which <hi>Luther</hi> was not aſham'd to own
himſelf guilty of; plainly acknowledging, that He <hi>ſeparated from the whole
World.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But it ſeems that the whole World was then corrupted, and the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
then every where profeſs'd, was overgrown with Superſtitions, Errors
and Abominations; ſuch as had crept into the Church, ſome five Hundred
Years before, ſome nine Hundred, and ſome a Thouſand; and 'twas from
theſe <hi>Luther</hi> ſeparated, intending to <hi>Reform</hi> Chriſtianity, and bring it to
the <hi>purity</hi> of the <hi>Primitive</hi> times, of the firſt three Hundred Years. And
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:55205:45"/>
was it not very ſtrange now, that ſo many groſs <hi>Fooleries,</hi> idle <hi>Superſtitions,</hi>
and even down-right <hi>Idolatry,</hi> ſhould creep into a <hi>Church,</hi> and ſpreading
it ſelf through all Nations, infect the whole World, becoming the publick
profeſſion of Chriſtendom for ſo many hundred Years, and be confirm'd
and eſtabliſh'd by the Laws of every Kingdom; and that no body ſhould
take notice of any ſuch thing, either at its firſt Riſe, or in all its progreſs
of ſo many Years: Inſomuch, that had not <hi>Luther</hi> made the Diſcovery, 'tis
likely we ſhould never have come to the knowledge of theſe Thouſand
Years Errors and Corruptions: No thinking Man certainly, but judges it
impoſſible, that the very <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> ſhould be ſhaken, and
the Religion planted by the Apoſtles turned into <hi>Idolatry;</hi> and yet that
no Learned Man ſhould any where appear to contradict theſe Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
no Zealous <hi>Pastors</hi> to withſtand them, no pious <hi>Princes</hi> to oppoſe
them: Hiſtory ſufficiently ſatisfies any Curious Reader, that from the firſt
planting of the <hi>Church,</hi> there has been in no Age, and Man yet that has
preach'd any <hi>Heterodox</hi> and <hi>Erroneous Tenets,</hi> and by introducing Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
has endeavour'd to infect the minds of the Faithful with <hi>Hereſie</hi> and
<hi>Superſtition,</hi> but immediately have ſtood up Virtuous and Learned Men,
in defence of the <hi>Truth,</hi> in their Writings and Sermons publickly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing
and condemning the <hi>Errours,</hi> and giving an Alarm to the World,
to beware of ſuch <hi>Deceivers,</hi> and their wicked <hi>Doctrine;</hi> and withal, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
omitting, to Record their Names to Poſterity; with an account of
the <hi>Year</hi> when they began to Preach, under <hi>what Emperours,</hi> and what was
the occaſion of their <hi>Revolt.</hi> Was not all this, and even more done againſt
<hi>Arius?</hi> How many appear'd againſt the <hi>Manichees?</hi> How many againſt
the <hi>Donatiſts;</hi> againſt the <hi>Novatians,</hi> againſt the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> the <hi>Neſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi>
the <hi>Eutychians,</hi> the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> the <hi>Berengarians, &amp;c.</hi> So that never
any thing has made ſo much noiſe in the World, ſo many commotions,
ſo many diſturbances; nothing has been ſo impoſſible to be carryed on
with <hi>ſecreſie</hi> and <hi>ſilence,</hi> as the broaching any new <hi>Hereſie,</hi> the making a
<hi>Schiſm,</hi> the <hi>alteration</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> the ſtarting up of ſome new Society and
Pretenders to <hi>Reformation.</hi> What Tumults did all the fore-mentioned
<hi>Apoſtles</hi> raiſe, diſturb'd at the Doctrine of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and the crying up the
<hi>Alcoran?</hi> What Stirs and Commotions at the <hi>Reformation</hi> of <hi>Church</hi> and
<hi>Faith,</hi> pretended by <hi>Luther, Zwinglius</hi> and <hi>Calvin?</hi> How then can it be
judg'd in the leaſt probable, that great variety of <hi>erroneous Tenets</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian
Doctrin</hi> ſhould be introduc'd by the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> contrary to the ſenſe
and belief of all Chriſtianity, either in the fourth, fifth, ſixth or tenth
Century; and yet that there ſhould not be the leaſt diſturbance occaſion'd
by it, no tumults or oppoſition; but all done with ſo much quietneſs,
in ſuch a profound Peace and Silence, that had it not been for the <hi>News</hi>
                           <pb n="71" facs="tcp:55205:45"/>
brought, ſome Ages after, we had never ſuſpected the <hi>Alteration?</hi> And
is this poſſible? Is it poſſible, that the whole Chriſtian World ſhould
<hi>change</hi> their <hi>Religion,</hi> both as to the <hi>Internal Belief,</hi> and <hi>external Profeſſion</hi>
and <hi>exerciſe</hi> of it; and no body be ſenſible of the change, ſo as to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the Abomination, or to tranſmit to Poſterity, even ſo much as the
leaſt Word of its beginning or propogation? Let any man upon ſome
conſideration, tell me, whether it be poſſible, that this one little King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>England</hi> ſhould fall from this <hi>Pure Apoſtolical</hi> Doctrine it <hi>now</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes,
into down-right <hi>Popery,</hi> (or any other way <hi>alter</hi> the whole Sheme
of its <hi>Religion</hi>) and have the <hi>Alteration</hi> confirm'd by ſeveral <hi>Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
and continue in the publick Exerciſe of it for a thouſand, five
hundred, or even on hundred years, and yet no one in this Kingdom,
or out of it, ſhould be ſenſible of the <hi>Alteration;</hi> but alſo to be manag'd
with ſuch <hi>Policy</hi> and <hi>Craft,</hi> that the whole buſineſs ſhould be a <hi>Secret</hi> for
many Ages? And if this be ſcarce to be thought poſſible of this one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
what can be imagin'd, when 'tis affirm'd of many Nations of the
whole Chriſtian World; Can any thing look more like a <hi>Fable</hi> or <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance?</hi>
Or can any Rational Man, barely upon ſuch a <hi>Report,</hi> condemn
the <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> of his <hi>Anceſtors,</hi> for <hi>Novelty</hi> and <hi>Humane Inventions;</hi>
and quite laying aſide this, take him for the Rule of his <hi>Reformation,</hi> who
thus, without Reaſon, Juſtice or Truth, has thrown ſuch an Infamy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all the Chriſtians preceeding him for a thouſand years?</p>
                        <p>But not to inſiſt upon theſe reaſonings, for the wiping off the ſcandal of
<hi>Novelty</hi> from the Doctrine of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> 'twould not be amiſs
here, to look beyond the <hi>Tenth Century,</hi> as alſo beyond the time of <hi>Pope
Gregory.</hi> And if in thoſe earlier Chriſtians, nothing can be found of that
<hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> which is charged as <hi>Novelty</hi> and <hi>Errour</hi> againſt the
<hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Rome,</hi> all the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in the World ſhall joyn with their <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,</hi>
and condemning <hi>Pope Gregory</hi> for a <hi>Seducer,</hi> and all of the <hi>Tenth
Age</hi> for ſo many <hi>Ignoramus</hi>'s, ſhall in one voice with them cry out againſt
all ſuch <hi>Doctrine, Novelty, Novelty, Errour, Errour.</hi> But if, on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
every <hi>Point</hi> thus challeng'd of <hi>Novelty,</hi> ſhall appear to have been the
<hi>Profeſſion</hi> of the <hi>Faithful</hi> in the time of the <hi>Purity</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> if before
Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> we find that <hi>Invocation of Saints, the Real Preſence, Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation,
Purgatory, Prayer for the Dead, the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Holy Images, Relicks,
the Sign of the Croſs, Proceſſions,</hi> &amp;c. were a <hi>receiv'd Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>common
Practice</hi> of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> in thoſe <hi>Primitive times;</hi> Then ſhall the <hi>Papists</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
as they are, as being of the ſinne <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> with thoſe
<hi>Antient Believers,</hi> without any <hi>Additions</hi> and <hi>Alterations;</hi> and all their <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries</hi>
ought in juſtice to <hi>return</hi> again to their <hi>Communion,</hi> and making
up one Quire, cry out with them; <hi>Bleſſed are they who believes as our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:55205:46"/>
believ'd. who receiv'd their Faith from the Apoſtles and their Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors;
and Accurſed be they, who ſeparate from this Faith, and upon the Noiſe
of Novelty and Errour, make Diviſions in the Church, and fall from her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
believing Lies rather than Truth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In order to this, I intended in this place to have given the <hi>Reader</hi> a fair
proſpect of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Belief</hi> of the Fathers, at the firſt five hundred
years after Chriſt; but finding the Matter to increaſe ſo much beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
upon my hands, I have reſerv'd them for another occaſion. But
however, upon confidence of what I am able to produce in that point, I
cannot omit to aſſure the <hi>Reader,</hi> that the chief, and moſt material Points
charg'd upon the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for <hi>Novelty,</hi> the <hi>Primitive Fathers</hi> do ſo
plainly own to have been the <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> in their
days; and to have been deliver'd down, and taught as the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the
<hi>Apoſtles;</hi> that an impartial Conſiderer need not take much time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
whether are the greater <hi>Innovators,</hi> thoſe that now Believe and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
theſe Tenets and Practices; or they that diſown or reject them. 'Tis
evident, that every Point of that Doctrine, which is now decry'd for <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi>
and baſely ſtigmatiz'd with the note of <hi>Errours</hi> introduc'd of late,
and of a modern invention, is by many Ages older than thoſe, who are
reputed to be the Authors; that every particular Article laid to the <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance</hi>
of the <hi>Tenth Century,</hi> and to the contrivance of <hi>Pope Gregory,</hi>
are as expreſly and clearly own'd, and taught ſome Ages before, as it is
now at this day. That thoſe Great Men were as down-right <hi>Papiſts</hi> in
theſe Points, as we are now. And that any <hi>diſturber</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> might
have as well defam'd them for believers of <hi>Novelties</hi> and <hi>Errours,</hi> as we
are now at this preſent. The <hi>Faith</hi> that they profeſs'd then, we profeſs
now; and if any of our Doctrine be <hi>Novelty,</hi> 'tis a <hi>Novelty</hi> of above
twelve hundred years ſtanding: And who can queſtion it not to be of an
older date? If it was the publick belief of the <hi>Chriſtian World,</hi> in the
fourth Century, who can be better Witneſſes of what was believ'd before
them, even in the third Age, than They? They tell us, that the Doctrine
they maintain and deliver, is the <hi>Faith of the Catholick Church,</hi> receiv'd
from their Fore-fathers, and as it was taught by the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> and we
don't find, that in any of theſe Points, they were challeng'd by any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
or oppoſed by the Paſtors of the Church, or any Writers, either
then living, or ſucceeding them, but received always with great venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
And upon what grounds can any callenge them now? Is it poſſible,
that any living now, can give a better account of what was believ'd and
practis'd in the third Age, than They that immediately follow'd them?
Which will be more credible Witneſſes of what was done in <hi>Forty Eight;</hi>
thoſe that ſhall be alive fifty years hence; or they that are not yet to come
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:55205:46"/>
theſe thouſand years? If therefore theſe Holy Men declare to us the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
they believ'd; with an aſſurance, that it was the Faith of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi>
Church, ſo believ'd by their Anceſtors, and as they had receiv'd it
from the Apoſtles and their Succeſſors; do not they deſerve better credit,
than others, who coming a thouſand years after, cry out againſt all
theſe ſeveral Points that they are nothing but <hi>Novelty</hi> and <hi>Errour?</hi> 'Tis
evident therefore to him, that this noiſe of <hi>Novelty,</hi> was nothing but a
<hi>ſtratagem</hi> for the introducing of <hi>Novelties;</hi> and that thoſe that brought
an Infamy upon theſe Points, by this aſperſion, might with as great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe
every, and as eaſily have laid a ſcandal upon other Article of the
Chriſtian Faith, which they thought fit to retain, and have had them all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded
for <hi>Novelty.</hi> And this has been ſo far done already, that even
three parts of that Doctrine, pick'd out by the <hi>firſt Reformers,</hi> for <hi>Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical,</hi>
and conform to the <hi>Word of God,</hi> we have ſeen in our days clamour'd
againſt for <hi>Novelty,</hi> and thrown by with as general Approbation, and
as clear Evidence of the charge, as ever they laid by <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi>
and the <hi>Primacy.</hi> The <hi>firſt Reformers</hi> caſt off the Authority of the <hi>firſt
Biſhop,</hi> as being a <hi>Novelty; Others</hi> ſoon after cry'd down the Authority of
<hi>all Biſhops,</hi> for a <hi>Novelty.</hi> The <hi>Firſt</hi> diſown'd a great part of the <hi>Prieſtly
Function,</hi> as being lately crept in; the <hi>Others</hi> diſown'd all the reſt, and
even <hi>Ordination</hi> it ſelf, as having all crept in together. The <hi>Firſt</hi> threw
out a great number of <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> as being not <hi>Apoſtolical,</hi> but of a modern
Inſtitution: The <hi>Others</hi> threw out even what they had retain'd, for being
no more an Ordination of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> than the former. The <hi>Firſt</hi> laid
by five of the <hi>Sacraments;</hi> the <hi>Others</hi> laid by the <hi>other two.</hi> And thus <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty</hi>
was the <hi>Word,</hi> whenſoever any receiv'd Doctrine of Chriſtianity was
to be outed, and may to be made for a <hi>Novelty:</hi> And he does dot doubt,
but, that if the noiſe of <hi>Novelty</hi> continue long, ſo unhappily ſucceſsful as
of late, and the liberty be permitted to every <hi>preſuming Spirit,</hi> to fix this
ſcandal upon whatſoever Doctrine or Inſtitution they ſhall think fit; that
all Chriſtianity is in a fair way of being thrown out of doors: and the
<hi>Bible, Preaching, Catechiſing, Christ's Incarnation</hi> and <hi>Paſſion,</hi> &amp;c. is as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be caſt off for a <hi>Novelty,</hi> as all the reſt have been. Thoſe that will
but ſhew to the People, that even theſe things have been all receiv'd from
<hi>Rome,</hi> and that the <hi>Papists</hi> by their <hi>Miſſonaries,</hi> ſpread theſe Doctrines
over the World, may ſoon perſwade them, they are nothing but <hi>Popiſh
Inventions,</hi> meer <hi>Novelties;</hi> that thoſe that began the <hi>Reformation,</hi> did
their buſineſs by halves, and that the World will never be <hi>throughly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,</hi>
till all theſe <hi>Romiſh Superſtitions,</hi> are laid by with the reſt; they
being of the ſame date. He takes no notice thereof of all the clamours
rais'd againſt ſeveral points of the receiv'd Doctrine of his Church; his
<pb facs="tcp:55205:47"/>
Faith is founded on better Principles, than to be ſhaken with ſuch a <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
Engine. Novelty, Novelty,</hi> is a cry, that may fright unthinking Men
from their Religion; but every ſerious Man will require better Motives
than a <hi>Noiſe,</hi> before he forſake any point of his Faith; and 'tis impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
he ſhould joyn with any in condemning ſuch things for <hi>Novelties,</hi>
which he finds the Profeſſion of all <hi>Antiquity.</hi>

                     <p>THeſe are the <hi>Characters</hi> of the <hi>Papiſt,</hi> as he is <hi>Miſ-repreſented,</hi> and as
<hi>Repreſented.</hi> And as different as the <hi>One</hi> is from the <hi>Other,</hi> ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
is the <hi>Papiſt,</hi> as reputed by his Maligners, from the <hi>Papiſt,</hi> as to what
he is in himſelf. The <hi>One</hi> is ſo Abſurd and Monſtrous, that 'tis impoſſible for
any one to be of that Profeſſion, without firſt laying by all thoughts of <hi>Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
and his <hi>Reaſon.</hi> The <hi>Other</hi> is juſt contradictory to this; and without
any farther Apology, may be expos'd to the peruſal of all Prudent and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>npaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Conſiderers, to examine if there be any thing in it, that deſerves the hatred
of any Chriſtian: And if it be not in every Point wholly conform to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Christ, and not in the leaſt contrary to Reaſon. The <hi>Former</hi> is a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt,</hi>
as he is generally apprehended by thoſe, who have a <hi>Proteſtant Education;</hi>
ſuch, as whenſoever reflected on, is conceiv'd to be a perverſe, malicious ſort of
Creature, <hi>Superſtitious, Idolatrous, Atheiſtical, Cruel, Bloody-minded,
Barbarous, Treacherous,</hi> and ſo <hi>Prophane,</hi> and every way <hi>Inhumane,</hi> that
'tis in ſome manner doubted, whether he be <hi>Man,</hi> or no. The <hi>other,</hi> is a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt,</hi>
whoſe <hi>Faith</hi> is according to the Propoſal of the Catholick Church; which
by Chriſt's Command, he is oblig'd to believe and hear, and whoſe whole deſign
in this World, is for obtaining Salvation in the next. And is it not ſtrange,
that theſe two Characters ſo directly oppoſite, ſo wholly unlike one the other, that
Heaven and Hell is not more, ſhould agree to the ſame perſon: 'Tis certainly a
ſtrange piece of injuſtice, and yet not at all ſtrange to thoſe, who know, that they
that follow Chriſt ſhall be hated by the World, that thoſe who ſtudy the Wiſdom
of Heaven, ſhall have the repute of Fools; and that as many as attend the <hi>Lamb,</hi>
ſhall be painted in the Livery of <hi>Satan.</hi> Our Fore-fathers were ſo, before us;
all the Primitive Chriſtians, the Apoſtles, and even the <hi>Lamb</hi> himſelf, our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.
<hi>Calumny</hi> ever follow'd them, <hi>Miſ-repreſentation</hi> waited upon them;
and what wonder that <hi>Infamy</hi> was their conſtant Attendance? And now if the
<hi>Orthodox Chriſtians,</hi> have thus in all Ages had their <hi>double Character;</hi> one
of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> exactly drawn from what they really believ'd and practis'd; the other
of <hi>Malice,</hi> copied from them, as <hi>Miſ-repreſented:</hi> 'Tis not at all ſtrange, to
find it ſo now in our days; when <hi>Calumny, Malice, Ignorance, &amp;c.</hi> are as
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:55205:47"/>
powerful as ever; who, though from the beginning of the World, that is above
five thouſand Years, they have made it their chief buſineſs to Paint, Copy and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
Things and Perſons; yet they never did it with ſo much injury, ſo alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<hi>unlikely,</hi> as they do now to the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> there being ſcarce any one Point
of their <hi>Faith and Profeſſion,</hi> which they do not either blindly miſtake, or baſely
diſguiſe. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> believe 'tis convenient to pray <hi>before Holy Images,</hi> and
give them an <hi>inferiour</hi> or <hi>relative</hi> reſpect. <hi>Theſe</hi> deſcribe the <hi>Papiſts</hi> Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Images,</hi> and Worſhipping them as <hi>Idols.</hi> The <hi>Papiſts</hi> believe 'tis good
to deſire the Prayers of the <hi>Saints,</hi> and Honour them as the Friends of God.
<hi>Theſe</hi> Paint out the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> as believing <hi>Saints</hi> to be their <hi>Redeemers,</hi> and
Adoring them as <hi>Gods.</hi> The <hi>Papiſts</hi> believe, that Chriſt left a Power in the
Prieſts of his Church, to Abſolve all truly Penitent Sinners from their Offences.
<hi>Theſe</hi> Repreſent the <hi>Papiſts</hi> as believing, That the Prieſts can infallibly forgive
all ſuch as come to Confeſſion, whether they Repent, or no. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> believe
there's Power in the <hi>ſupreme Paſtor,</hi> upon due Motives of granting <hi>Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;</hi>
that is, of releaſing to the Faithful ſuch. Temporal Penalties, as remain due
to their paſt ſins, already remitted as to their guilt; on condition they perform
ſuch Chriſtian Duties as ſhall be aſſign'd them, <hi>i. e.</hi> humble themſelves by Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Confeſs their ſins with a hearty Repentance, Receive Worthily, and give Alms
to the Poor, <hi>&amp;c. Theſe</hi> make the <hi>Papiſts</hi> believe, That the Pope, for a ſum of
Mony, can give them leave to commit what ſins they ſhall think fit, with a certain
Pardon for all Crimes already incurr'd; and that there can be no danger of
Damnation to any, that can but make a large Preſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> at his death. The
<hi>Papiſts</hi> believe, That by the Merits of Chriſt, the good Works of a juſt Man,
are acceptable to God, and through his Goodneſs and Promiſe, meritorious of
eternal happineſs. <hi>Theſe</hi> report, That the <hi>Papiſts</hi> believe they can <hi>merit</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by their own Works, without any dependance on the work of our Redemption.
The <hi>Papiſts</hi> worſhip Chriſt really preſent in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> true God and Man.
<hi>Theſe</hi> ſay they fall down to, and worſhip a <hi>piece</hi> of <hi>Bread. Some Papiſts</hi>
maintain the <hi>Depoſing Power: Theſe</hi> will have it to be an <hi>Article</hi> of their
<hi>Faith,</hi> and that they are oblig'd to't by their Religion. <hi>Some Papiſts</hi> have been
<hi>Traytors, Rebels, Conſpirators,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Theſe</hi> make theſe Villanies to be <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious</hi>
among the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and that 'tis the Doctrine of their Church. And
thus there is ſcarce any one thing belonging to their Faith and Exerciſe of their
Religion, which is not wrong'd in the deſcribing it, and injuriouſly <hi>Miſ-repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented.</hi>
And if any be ſo curious, as to deſire to be ſatisfied, how this comes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout;
let him but ſtand by any of the <hi>Undertakers,</hi> while they are taking the
<hi>Copy</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> and obſerve their Method, and he may ſoon come to the bottom
of the <hi>Myſtery.</hi> He may ſee them ſeriouſly viewing ſome of her Tenets, and
upon a ſhort conſideration, immediately to fall to the making <hi>Inferences,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
<hi>Conſequences,</hi> then down go theſe for ſo many <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Popery.</hi>
                        <pb n="76" facs="tcp:55205:48"/>
They go on, and ſee other of her Tenets, and theſe containing <hi>Myſteries,</hi> ſuch as
<hi>Reaſon</hi> cannot reach to, when <hi>Faith</hi> is not an aſſiſtant; they are preſently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
with variety of <hi>Abſurdities,</hi> and <hi>ſeeming Contradictions:</hi> And down
go theſe to the former, for ſo many <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Popery.</hi> They paſs on to others,
and theſe being not conform to the Principles of their Education; ſeveral <hi>Miſ-conſtructions</hi>
are preſently rais'd upon them, and down go theſe for ſo many
<hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Popery.</hi> They look forward, and ſeeing others, in the practice of

whatſoever <hi>Treaſons</hi> and <hi>Inhumanities,</hi> they find committed by any

and tho' through their extravagancies and raſhneſs, they deſerve not
credit even in a trifle? yet their whole <hi>Narrative</hi> ſhall be accepted, and all their

ſcurrilous Pamphlet and abuſive Libel; and ſuch <hi>ridiculous Fables,</hi> as are only
fit for a Chimney-corner, they borrow thence, and ſet them down for ſo many
<hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Popery.</hi> They turn over every <hi>Popiſh Author,</hi> and whatſoever

through <hi>Flattery, Diſguſt,</hi> or <hi>Faction,</hi> appear in any of them, they are all
mark'd out for ſo many <hi>Articles of Popery.</hi> And by theſe and ſuch like means
is finiſht at laſt a <hi>compleat draught of Popery,</hi> in which ſhe is render'd ſo <hi>foul,
monſtrous</hi> and <hi>abominable,</hi> that there can be nothing raked from the very
ſinks of <hi>Turciſm,</hi> nothing borrow'd from the <hi>wild Africans,</hi> or <hi>barbarous A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans,</hi>
that can make her more <hi>odious,</hi> or add to her <hi>deformity.</hi> Why, and
is not <hi>Popery</hi> then, ſuch as 'tis thus generally painted? No, 'tis no more like it,
than <hi>Monarchy</hi> is to that which turbulent <hi>Republican</hi> Spirits ſhew for it; when
diſplaying to the multitude ſome <hi>Miſcarriages</hi> of State, <hi>Frailties</hi> in Perſons in
Dignities, <hi>Abuſes</hi> of Government, &amp;c. they cry out, <hi>Behold this is Monarchy.</hi>
By theſe means making it Infamous among the People, that they may more eaſily
overthrow it. And are not the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſuch as they are commonly <hi>Repreſented?</hi>
No: They are no more alike, than the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were of old under the Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
Emperors, to what they appear'd, when cloathed with <hi>Lions and Bears
Skins</hi> they were expoſed in the Amphi-theatre to <hi>Wild Beaſts;</hi> under thoſe <hi>bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd
Shapes</hi> to provoke their <hi>Savage Oppoſites</hi> to greater fury; and that they
might-infallibly, and with more rage, be torn in pieces. Let <hi>Monarchy</hi> be ſhewn
in its <hi>own colours;</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> be expos'd in their <hi>own form,</hi> and one
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:55205:48"/>
will have but few Maligners, and the others will meet with a more Tame beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
even from the <hi>wildeſt Beaſts.</hi> Let any but ſearch into the <hi>Councils</hi> of
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> even that of <hi>Trent,</hi> than which none can be more <hi>Popiſh;</hi>
let them peruſe her <hi>Catechiſms,</hi> that, <hi>ad Parochos,</hi> or others ſet forth for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors
to inſtruct their Flock, and for Children, Youth, and others to learn their
Chriſtian Doctrine, of which there is extant great variety in <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Let them
examine <hi>Vernon's Rule of Faith,</hi> and that ſet forth by the Biſhop of <hi>Condan.</hi>
Let them look into the Spiritual Books of Direction: Thoſe of Biſhop <hi>Sales,</hi> the
<hi>Following of Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Chriſtian Rules,</hi> the <hi>Spiritual Combat, Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do's
Works,</hi> and infinite others of this ſort, which Papists generally keep by them
for their Inſtruction: And then let them freely declare, whether the <hi>Papiſts</hi> are
ſo <hi>ill principled,</hi> either as to their <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Morals,</hi> as they are generally made
appear. A little diligence in this kind, with a ſerious inquiry into their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
their manner of Living and Dying, will eaſily diſcover, that <hi>that</hi> of
<hi>Beaſt,</hi> with which they are commonly expos'd to publick, is not <hi>theirs,</hi> but only
of the <hi>skin,</hi> that is thrown over them. The Papiſts own, that there are amongst
them Men of very ill Lives, and that if every corner be narrowly ſifted, there
may be found great abuſes, even of the most ſacred things; that ſome in great
Dignities have been highly vicious, and carried on wicked Deſigns: That ſome
Authors maintain and publiſh very abſurd Opinions, and of ill conſequence. But
theſe things are nothing of their <hi>Religion,</hi> they are <hi>Imperfections</hi> indeed, the
<hi>Crimes,</hi> the <hi>Scandals</hi> of ſome in their <hi>Communion;</hi> but ſuch they are ſo far
from being oblig'd to approve, maintain or imitate, that they wiſh with all their
heart, there had been never any ſuch thing, and deſire in <hi>theſe Points a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
Reformation.</hi> Tho' the <hi>Imprudences</hi> therefore, the <hi>Failings,</hi> the
<hi>Extravagencies,</hi> the <hi>Vices,</hi> that may be pick'd up, throughout the whole <hi>Society</hi>
of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> are very numerous and great, and too too ſufficient, if drawn together,
for the compoſing a moſt <hi>Deform'd Antichriſtian-Monſter;</hi> yet the <hi>Popery</hi>
of the <hi>Roman-Catholicks</hi> is no ſuch <hi>Monſter,</hi> as 'tis painted. Thoſe things
which are commonly brought againſt them, being as much deteſted by them, as by
the Perſons that lay the charge of their diſ-favour; and having no more relation
to them, than <hi>Weeds</hi> and <hi>Tares</hi> to the <hi>Corn</hi> amongst which it grows; or <hi>Chaff</hi>
to the <hi>Wheat,</hi> with which it lies mix'd in one heap. A <hi>Papiſt</hi> therefore is no more
than he is above <hi>Repreſented;</hi> and whoſoever enters that <hi>Communion,</hi> has no
obligation of believing otherwiſe, then as there ſpecified. And though in each Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
I have cited no <hi>Authorities;</hi> yet for the truth and exactneſs of the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,</hi>
I Appeal to the <hi>Council of Trent.</hi> And if in any Point it ſhall be found
to diſagree, I again promiſe, upon notice, publickly to own it. And as for the
other Part, of the <hi>Papiſt Miſ-repreſented,</hi> it contains ſuch Tenets as are <hi>wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully</hi>
charged upon the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> and in as many reſpects, as it is contrary to the
other <hi>Character;</hi> in ſo many, it is contrary to the <hi>Faith</hi> of their Church: And
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:55205:49"/>
ſo far, they are ready to diſown them, and ſubſcribe to their Condemnation. And
though any ſerious enquirer may be eaſily ſatisfied as to the truth of this; yet for
a publick ſatisfaction, to ſhew that thoſe <hi>Aominable Unchriſtian Doctrines</hi> are
no part of their <hi>Belief;</hi> (however extravagant ſome men may be in their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;)
the <hi>Papiſts</hi> acknowledge that a <hi>Faith</hi> aſſenting to <hi>ſuch Tenets,</hi> is wholly
oppoſite to the Hononr of God, and Deſtructive to the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of Chriſt, and do
publickly invoke God Almighty's Judgements upon that Church, which teaches
either publickly or privately ſuch a <hi>Faith.</hi> And ſince 'tis lawful for any Chriſtian
to anſwer <hi>Amen,</hi> to ſuch <hi>Anathema's,</hi> as are pronouno'd againſt things <hi>apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſinful;</hi> the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> to ſhew to the World that they diſown the following <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,</hi>
commonly laid at their dore; do here oblige themſelves, that if the enſuing
<hi>Curſes</hi> be added to thoſe appointed to be read on the First day of <hi>Lent:</hi> They

                     <p>VII. Curſed is he that believes, (that Independent of the Merits and Paſſion of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>)
he can Merit Salvation by his own good Works; or make condign ſatisfaction for the
guilt of his ſins, or the pains Eternal due to them. ℟. <hi>Amen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>VIII. Curſed is he that contemns the Word of God, or hides it from the people, on
deſign to keep them from the knowledge of their Duty, and to preſerve them in Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance

                     <p>XI. Curſed it he that omit any of the Ten Commandments, or keeps the people

XIII. Curſed is he that believes that the <hi>Pope</hi> can give to any, upon any account

                     <p>XVI. Curſed is he who places Religion in nothing but a pompous ſhew conſiſting on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

℟. <hi>Amen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>XVII. Curſed is he who loves or promotes cruelty, that teaches People to be Bloody<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded,

                     <p>XVIII. Curſed is he who teaches it Lawful to do any wicked thing, tho' it be for the
Intereſt and Good of Mother-Church: or that any Evil action may be done, that Good
may come of it. ℟. <hi>Amen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>XIX. Curſed are we, if amongſt all thoſe wicked Principles and Damnable Doctrine,
commonly laid at our Dores, any one of them be the Faith of our Church: And Curſed
are we, if we do not as heartily deteſt all thoſe Helliſh Practices, at they that ſo vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
urge them againſt us. ℟. <hi>Amen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>XX. Curſed are we, if in an anſwering, and ſaying <hi>Amen,</hi> to any of theſe <hi>Curſes,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>And can the <hi>Papiſts</hi> then, thus ſeriouſly, and without check of Conſcience,
ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to all theſe <hi>curſes?</hi> Yes they can, and are ready to it, whenſoever,
and as often as it ſhall be requir'd of them. And what then is to be ſaid of
thoſe, who either by <hi>Word</hi> or <hi>Writing,</hi> charge theſe Doctrines upon the <hi>Faith</hi>
of the <hi>Church of Rome, Is a lying ſpirit in the mouth of all the Prophets?
Are they all gone aſide? Do they back-bite with their tongue, do evil
to their Neighbour, and take up reproach againſt their Neighbour?</hi> I'le
ſay no ſuch thing, but leave the impartial Conſiderer to judge. One thing I can
ſafely affirm, that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> are foully <hi>Miſ-repreſented,</hi> and ſhew in publick
as much unlike what they are, as the Chriſtians were of old by the Gentiles;
that they lie under a great Calumny, and ſeverely ſmart in good Name, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
and Eſtates, for ſuch things, which They, as much, and as heartily detest,
as thoſe who accuſe them. But the comfort is, Christ has ſaid to his Followers,
<hi>Ye ſhall be hated of all men,</hi> (Matt. 10. 22.) and St. <hi>Paul, we are made a
ſpectacle unto the World;</hi> and we don't doubt, that who bears this with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
ſhall for every loſs here, and content, receive a hundred fold in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
<hi>For baſe things of the World, and things which are deſpiſed, hath
God choſen,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 28.</p>
