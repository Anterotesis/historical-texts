         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A MEMENTO For the PEOPLE, about their Elections of MEMBERS for the approaching PARLIAMENT.</head>
            <p n="1">I.</p>
            <p n="1"> 
               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Emember that the choice of your Law-makers is your firſt common right, by which you diſtinguiſh your ſelves from ſlaves; for in the uſe thereof, you ſhew the original of your own Authority and Government, and how that every one of you hath ſuch an inherent and natural Right in his own perſon, as not to be diſpoſed of, ordered, bounded or limited, but by his own Conſent in Parliament; the Members thereof being the peoples Repreſentatives. And therefore if you be tender of any thing, that you call or think your Right, Priviledge or Liberty, be tender of this, as the foundation and root of all your Liberties.</p>
            <p n="2">II.</p>
            <p n="2"> Remember that the choice of your Law-makers, is the greateſt truſt in civil matters, and of the neereſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to you all, that you ever did, or can, or ſhall repoſe in any body: you may truſt ſome with your eſtates, and it may be with your perſons too; but you truſt your choſen deputies in Parliament with your perſons, your lives, your poſterities, and your whole Country; and they may under God involve you in blood and confuſion, or ſettle you in peace.</p>
            <p>O then be cautious and circumſpect in your choyce now to be made, and conſider whom you may ſafely truſt.</p>
            <p>And firſt, conſider whether it be conſonant to your ſafety, and the end for which you elect, to truſt any that have ever broken their faith, or falſified their truſt formerly put in them. Remember the Declarations, Vows and Promiſes of the Army, how and by whom violated and broke. The <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>alian</hi> ſaies, <hi>If a man deceives me once, it is his fault; but if he deceive me twice, it is my own fault.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Conſider, whether it be fit to confer your own Legiſlative Authority upon any perſons, who have another Legiſlative Authority ſtampt upon them already. For how can it be look'd upon but as prodigious, for two Suns to be ſeen in one firmament?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Conſider, whether you may truſt thoſe that ſhall not be equally concerned with you in all the Laws to be made, or are not equally ſubject to them with your ſelves?</p>
            <p>Thoſe that live, and intend to live upon the publick purſe, are not equally concerned in levying of monyes upon you, with thoſe that live onely upon their own eſtates and trades. Publick Officers, that have great Places and Salaries from the common purſe, put in a peny, and take out a pound.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that have been made fat by the blood and ruines of the people, you can have little hopes of: for, <hi>can a Blackmoore change his skin, or a Leopard his ſpots?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thoſe that are to execute the Laws, may avoid the ſtroak which others muſt abide: for how is it conſonant to freedom and ſafety, for the Legiſlative power, and the Executive power, to be in the ſame hands?</p>
            <p>Therefore you may ſafely truſt thoſe to make your Laws, that muſt do the ſame good or harm to themſelves, which they do to you. And ſuch as have not been ſtained with the corruptions of the times, as have been ever conſtant to the intereſt of the people, and as have not been inriched by the oppreſſions and ruines of the Land, you may ſafelieſt truſt; of ſuch there being moſt hope.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <note place="margin">Exciſe men, Corrupt Lawyers, Impropriators, Farmors of Tythes, Sword,—&amp;c.</note> Conſider, whether you may truſt any that are ingaged either by their profit or honour, or any kinde of intereſt, to continue any of the burthens or grievances that are upon you: as the Silver-Smiths were engaged to maintain the Image of <hi>Diana</hi> and her Temple.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Conſider, whether you may truſt any man, that wants either depth of judgement, or courage: he that wants the firſt, may ſuffer you to be cozened of your Liberties; and he that wants the other, will certainly betray your liberties unto any body that boldly attempts to take them from you.</p>
            <p>And further conſider, That thoſe whom you chuſe for your Members in Parliament, you chuſe to ſit in your own ſtead, to repreſent the whole Nation; their vote to be the voice of the people, and you to be bound thereby, onely ſaving to your ſelves your fundamental Laws and Liberties, as unalterable, and not within their truſt to violate or deſtroy. All that are worth 200 <hi>l</hi> in Counties, are to be really in Parliament, voting there, and conſenting to what is done by their Knights or Truſtees, whom they have choſen for their Counties; and all the Burgeſſes and Inhabitants of Cities and Burroughs, are alſo there in Parliament, by chuſing them that ſhall ſpeak for them and vote for them.</p>
            <p>And that this Liberty, this Principle of common Right, might not be infringed or reſtrained, care was taken in <hi>The Instrument of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> ſet forth by the Lord Protector, <hi>That Tradeſment that live in Cities and Burroughs, ſhould be all free to chuſe, although not worth</hi> 200 <hi>l</hi> for that reſtriction of 200 <hi>l</hi> limited in the ſaid <hi>Inſtrument of Government,</hi> is for ſuch as are thereby enabled to chuſe Members for Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: which are the <hi>Knights girt with Swords,</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Indentures;</hi> but as for Burgeſſes, there is no diſtinction betwixt rich and poor; as all muſt be ſubject to the Law, ſo all muſt be free to chuſe: which is very much to his Highneſs honour.</p>
            <p>And indeed, Tradeſmen that live in Cities, are as uſeful to the Nation, and bear as much ſhare in the burthens thereof, when they are not worth 200 <hi>l</hi> as thoſe that live in Counties, and are worth 200 <hi>l</hi> And the encouragement and reſpect to Traders, being of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to the Commonwealth, It was not thought fit to reſtrain the the choice in Cities and Burroughs to thoſe onely who were worth 200 <hi>l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither is that reſtriction of the Electors for Counties, any ſtraitning of the election, but an inlargement thereof, full of reaſon; for the reſtraint formerly was ſtrictly to Freeholders, having—<hi>xl.s.</hi> by the year; and now by the Lord Protector, every man, though a Copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder, or a man of a perſonal eſtate, if he be worth 200 <hi>l</hi> is made a chuſer, as well as Freeholders. So that all that are worth 200 <hi>l</hi> may chuſe for Counties, as well as Freeholders; and for Cities and Burroughs, all univerſally are to chuſe, who have not diſabled themſelves by ſomething done in the late wars.</p>
            <p>Now Sirs, be adviſed to ſet aſide all faction, ſelf-intereſt, favour and fear, that may byaſs your judgements in your choyce; and agree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to have regard to the worth and merit of thoſe you chuſe; let their wiſdom, faithfulneſs and courage, their publike zeal and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the cauſe of the people, their moderation, charity and compaſſion, their freedom from the cruelty and oppreſſion of the times, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you to chuſe them. And in ſo doing, you will honour your Country, and ſettle it in righteouſneſs, peace and plenty. And the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations that are yet unborn, will have cauſe to bleſs you.</p>
