            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And not that these thyngs one ly are to be credyted and assented vnto, but also that all thynges els (which were taught by the Apostles, and whych haue bene by a whole vnyuersall consent of the Churche of Chryste, euer sythe that tyme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynually taught, and taken alwayes for true) ought to be receaued, accepted, taken and kepte, as a true and perfecte doctryne apostolique.</p>
                  <p>This then is the fyrst acception of fayth, whyche man hath of God, and wherein man doth not leaue to hys owne naturall knowledge (whych is by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son) but he leauethe to the knowledge attayned by fayth: wythout whych faith, man is ignoraunte and blynde, and cannot vnderstande, accordynge as the prophete Esay affirmeth in hys. vii. Chapiter, saying: <hi>Nisi credideritis, non intelligetis.</hi> That is to saye: onlesse ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue, ye shal not vnderstand. This faith is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng, the entry, and the introduction vnto all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian relygion, &amp; Godlynes: For as S. Paule sayeth in his. xi.

it do procede no farther, adioynyng with it, hope and charitie, it is called in Scrypture, a deade faythe, be cause it is voyde and destitute of lyfe, aud wantethe the helpe, and efficacie of charitie. And this much for fayth as it is considered in the fyrst acception.</p>
                  <p>Faythe as it is considered in the seconde accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, maye not be alone, but muste nedes haue hope, and charitie, annexed and ioyned vnto it. And faythe so taken, doth signify not onely the beleif and perswa sion whych was before mencioned in the fyrst accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and taking of fayth: but also it signifyeth a sure confydence, and hope, to attayne all whatsoeuer god hath promised for Christes sake, and it signifieth, and comprehendeth also, a hartye loue to GOD, and an obedience to his commaundementes.</p>
                  <p>And faythe thus considered, is a lyuely faythe, and worketh in man a ready submission of hys wyll to Goddes wyll. And this is the effectual fayth whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che worketh by charitie, and whyche (as S.

                  <p>By this fayth, Abraham, not knowyng whyther he shoulde go, went out of his countrye, and dwelte in the lande of beheste, or promyse, as in a straunge lande, lokyng, and trustyng for a cytye, founded, and buylded by almyghty God.</p>
                  <p>By this fayth also, Abraham, when he was temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, was ready to offer vp his onelye begotten sonne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

In whych places man may not thinke that we be iustifyed by fayth, (as fayth is a seuerall vertue, seperated from hope, and charytie, from feare of God &amp; from repentaunce) but by fayth there is ment not the late inuented and deuised faith that is to say, onely faythe, or fayth alone, but faythe with the foresayde vertues, coupled, and ioyned to gether, conteinyng as is aforesaide the obedience to the hole doctryne and religion of Chryst.</p>

And amonges them that haue a respect vn to scrypture, and the wryters thereof, a Sacrament doth signify a mistery, that is to saye, a secret or hyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den thynge apperteynyng to the religion: and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng consydered, it is sometymes taken in a more lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger signifycation, and sometymes in a more strayter: and beynge taken in the larger signification it doth signifye euerye secrete mysterye appertaynynge to religion, and euerye holy thynge hydden, thoughe it be not a sygne or token of another thyng, as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> we vse to name and say, the sacrament of the godheade, meanynge thereby the very godhead it selfe, whythe is a hyd and secrete thynge, and yet not a sygne or token of any other thynge.

That is to say Asacrament is a visible signe of an inuisible grace of God, whiche grace, God effectually and certenly, doth worke in it, so that the same be duelye handled, and not vnworthelye receaued. Accordyng to which diffinition, and the worde sacrament being so taken, there are. vij. sacramentes of the churche and no mo, it is to wytte, Baptysine, Confyrmation, Penaunce, Eucharistie (or the sacrament of the aultare) Order,

Nowe concernynge the fyrst of these foure thynges to be noted in Baptysme, ye shall knowe that oure sauyoure Chryste, when he dyd sende hys apostles to preach throughout the hole worlde, he dyd saye vnto them, as is testyfyed in the xxviii.

For he that receaueth this Sacramente worthelye, vnder the one kynde, as vnder the forme of breade onely, receaueth the hole bodye and bloude of Chryst, and as many and great benefittes of Christ as he that receaueth it in both kyndes. And therefore if any man should teache, that the laye people (which by the ordinaunce and auncient custome of the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke churche, haue vsed to receaue this holy sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t in fourme of breade onelye) be seduced and soo cause them to thynke, that the holle bodye and bludde of Chryst, where not comprehended in that onely forme of breade, as well as in both the kyndes, this doctrine ought vtterlye to be refused and abiected, as a verye pestiferouse and deuely she doctryne. For surely scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth the contrary, and also naturall reason, althoughe it cannot comprehende the hole mistery of this sacrament, yet herein it teacheth vs agreablye w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> scrypture, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that liuely body cannot be without bloud and therefore men ought to be ledde from that fonde opinion (yf any such be) both by that faith, and credit which they do owe vnto scripture, and in this poynt also by naturall reason. And chrysten men knowinge this, ought not to grudge at thys fourme and maner of receauyng of this sacrament vnder one kynd, vsed and allowed by the catholyke church, both to auoide that erroure afore rehersed, and also for manye other weyghtie considerations, concernynge bothe the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>te, and the libertye, and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

And yet to stably she this poynte (touchyng the receauing of this sacramente vnder one kynde) both with testimonies of scripture, and also otherwyse, ye shall vnderstand, that whan our sauyour Christ did delyuer this sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente vnder bothe kyndes, in the institution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he of purpose had onely his twelue Apostles with hym, to declare vnto vs that he there dyd rather pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe vnto them being preistes, how they and theyr successours should consecrate, and offer, and also they themselues in theyr ministery receaue the same, than howe it shoulde be receaued of other, not beynge of the same vocation as the Apostles were of. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was neuer yet lawfull, but very straytely to be punyshed yf a prest whan he dyd consecrate, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the same, dyd not withall receaue it vnder bothe kyndes.

adioyne or cleaue to hys wyfe, and they shall be two in one flesh. By whyche wordes it euident<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye appeareth, that God is the author, inuentour aud maker of Matrimony: which thing to be so, Sainte Mathewe in the. xix. chapter of his ghospel, Saynct Marke in the. x. &amp; S. Paule in the. vi. and. xi. of his fyrst epistle to the Corynthians, and the saide Saint Paule in his fyrst chapter to the Ephesians, do plain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye affirme and testifie, and so haue you thys poyncte suffyciently opened and proued vnto you.</p>
                     <p>And as touchynge the thyrde thynge, it is to wit, where Matrymony was instituted, ye shall soone learne that in the fyrste and seconde chapter of Genesis, where Moyses declarethe that almyghtye God hauynge planted paradyse, a place of great plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sure, and therein puttynge man, whome he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, dyd not onelye ioyne man and woman there to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gether, as is before sayd, but also dyd blesse the sayde man and woman, sayinge. <hi>Crescite, &amp; multiplicamini &amp; reple<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te terram.</hi> that is to saye.

                     <p>Now concernyng the fourth poynte, it is to wyt, Wherfore was matrimonie instituted, ye shal
<pb facs="tcp:25020:104"/>
know that consyderyng the state of matrimonye, as it was in the tyme of innocencye, and before synne was committed by Adam and Eue, soo the cause of institution of matrimonye was double one concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the persones maryed, and the other concerning the issue that shoulde come of them. And as touching the personnes maryed, the cause in them is that ther should be thereby, the fyrste and cheife copulation of humayne societie, hauyng a true and an amiable con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iunction in it, of man and woman, the one to rule, &amp; the other to obeye. And as touchyng the issue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cause of marryage in that respecte, is both in honeste loue to brynge forth chyldren, and also Godlye and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously to bringe vp the same, both which causes we haue expressed and sette forth in scrypture, the fyrste Genesis, ii, where God sayeth. <hi>Faciamus ei adiutoriu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> simile si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi.</hi> That is to saye. Let vs make an ayde or help vnto him lyke vnto hym selfe. And the second Genesis. i. where God sayeth, <hi>Crescite &amp; multiplicamini &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plete terram.</hi> That is to say. Do you increase, and be you multiplied &amp; replenishe youe the earthe. And consideryng the state of matrymony as it was after the synne or fal of Adam and Eue, then besides the foresayde .ii. causes there was a third, it is to wit to avoyde fornication and that humayne weakenes and infirmitie myght haue therfore, the honest reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye of mariage and lawefull copulation, accordyng wherevnto Saynte Augustyne. <hi>De Genesi ad literam.</hi> in hys nynth booke and seuenth chapter, sayeth thus. <hi>Deni<expan>

                     <p>And here by the way ye shal note, that yf our fore fathers Adam and Eue had not sinned, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> they and theyr ofsprynge shoulde not haue bene troubled with the prickynge or styrrynge of the fleshe, nor wyth the feruor or rage of carnal lust, but should haue begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> or procreated chyldren without anye suche styrre or rage, and without any synne at all, yea and with me rite also, where after theyr fall, bothe they and theyr posteritie by the deadely lawe of concupiscence, inhe tynge vnto theyr members, (without the which car nall coniunction is not done) had not that liberty, so that nede it was, bothe them and theyr posteritie to haue some good ayde and helpe, to excuse carnal co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation (otherwyse culpable) and to make it lawe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. And herevpon S.

But yet besides these cause or endes, for which matrimony was by god in para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise instituted, there is another not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> least but rather
<pb facs="tcp:25020:105"/>
and principall (yf we consider and regarde the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of God herein) whyche is, that Matrimonye or maryage shoulde be a fytte sygne or mystical token, of that mooste assured and strong coniunction, that should be betwene Christ (yet, then to come) and the church, which churche euerlastyngly before the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the worlde, aud from the begynnynge, God dydde preordeyne, chose and electe vnto hymselfe: as Paule witnesseth in the fyrste chapters of his Epy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles to the Ephesians and to Tyte. For the vnspeak able wysedome of God, forseyng and knowynge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that man after his creation throughe the wyly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and deceate of the deuyl, woulde fal, and deserue eternall death, dyd most mercifully in thys hys fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syght <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And therefore appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge vnto Chryste (who shoulde be the father, and parent of thys generation) a maryage mete therevn to, dyd to mans great and marueylous comforte in the myraculous couplynge, and conioynynge of Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> (representyng Chryst, then to come) and Eue, being formed and made of the ribbe of Adames syde, Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> beyng a slepe, dyd (I saye) as in a shadowe, and a fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, shewe before, and expresse the same knotte and bonde of mariage of Christ and the church. And this (as it were) plyghtyng of trouth, for thys marryage to come, was farther by a promyse made by God to man confyrmed and ratifyed, when he sayde in the thyrd chapyter of Genesis, that the sede of the wo man shoulde with his foote tread downe the

here declare vnto you foure specyall meanes greately aydyng to the auoydyng of the sayde daunger. The fyrste is to vse earnest prayer, the second to forbeare al occasions of synne, as to flye euyll companye, and to haue regarde to the vse of oure senses, by whyche as by wyndowes death dothe enter into oure soule, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordynge to the saying of Job, in his. xxxi. chapter. <hi>Pepegifoedus cum oculis meis ut ne cogitarem quidem de uirgine.</hi>

The thyrde is to tame our fleshe and to kepe it vnder, and brynge it vnto bondage, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge to the example of Saynte Paule, declarynge in the ninth chapyter of hys fyrste pystle to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyans where he sayth of hym selfe thus. <hi>Subigo corpus meum, &amp; in seruitute redicd, ne cum alijs predicem, ipse reprobus efficiar.</hi> That is to saye. I chastyce or tame my bodye, and bryng it in subiection or bondage leaste whyle I preache to other I my selfe become a cast awaye.

And as it is wrytten in the. xxiii, chapyter of Ecclesy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticus. <hi>Multam malitiam docuit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And here you shall note that when we aduyse you to flye euyll companye and Idlenes, we imploye therin that you shoulde alwayes haunte the companye of honest and godlye personnes, and also euer to be ententiuelye occupyed in some vertuous ex excyse or meditation. And by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> waye we thynke thys good to note agayne vnto you as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>cernynge concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyscence, that al be it not to haue it at al in thys lyfe, is a thinge to vs impossible, yet to consent vnto it, or by the grace of God to dissent from it, is a thing wel possyble vnto vs. And in dede to dissent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> or resyste concupiscence we owghte to the vttermooste of oure power, and vsyng the specyall meanes before rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed or some of them, we by the grace of GOD shalbe hable so to doo. And to procede further concernynge the declaration of this tenthe commaundemente, ye shall knowe, that all they be transgressoures of thys commaundemement who by delyberatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> and ful con sent, doo cast, or set theyr myndes, and bartes, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complyshe the concupyscence, and desyre whych they haue to obteyne, and gette vnlawefullye an other mans wyfe chylde, seruaunt, house, lande, cattayle, or any thyng that is theyr neyghboures.

And as concerninge these wordes, whych art in heauen. we maye not by theym vnderstande, that God is conteyned, and included wythin the heauenes, as the aungelles, and holy sayntes are, for (as Salomon sayeth in the thyrd booke of the kynges and the eyght chapyter.) The heauens of heauens doo not comprehende or include hym. But in thys respecte he is sayde to be in heauen, because he, by hys almyghtye power, doth conteyne, kepe, holde vp, and mayntayne, all the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, and also all other creatures, whyche are enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and shutte vnder the cope, or compasse of heauen accordynge as S.

Bycause that god onely as he hath made heauen, and all thynges vnder heauen, so he onely is in all the heauens, and wyth hys almyghtye power conserueth, and kepethe them in all theyr beyng. And here must we note, that we maye not thynke, that god is so in heauen, that thereby he can not be, or is not in earth also, as shall please hym selfe.

Youre rewarde is greate in heauen. And here doo you marke that these wordes, whych arte in heauen, are so placed and set furth, to styrre vp our heartes to God, and to cause in vs an inward desyre, and a greate care, and studye to come to the place where our heauenly father is: yea, and muche to couete hys syghte and presence. For lyke as a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng chylde is euer desyrous to be where hys father is, euen so oughte we euer to desyre to be wyth oure heauenlye father, and to endeuoure our selues, that our conuersation be al wythdrawen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the worlde, the fleshe, and the deuyll, and be set vpon heauen and heauenlye thynges, as S.

And howe can we fayle thereof, yf we wyll, seynge oure heauenlye father hathe bothe the wyll, and also the power to perfourme it? Hys wyll we clearelye vnderstande, in asmuche as he made hym selfe to be oure father: hys power is well knowen, for that he is a God of power, and glorye, and maker, and preseruer of Heauen, Earthe, and of

all that in them is. And here shall you further note y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> these wordes. Our father whych art in heauen. are put lyke a prologue before all the seuen petitions, (yea and euery one of them may haue prefixed, before them the same prologue) declaryng playnely, that no man can saye thys prayer truely, and duelye, that no pleasure of god, and hys owne meryte, excepte he haue fayth, hope, and Charytye, for wythout faythe, nor can say truelye, O father, and wy thoute cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rytye to hys neyghbour, no man cane say truelye and meritoriouslye, Oure father, and wythout hope, no man can saye truelye, Whyche arte in hauen doo thou remyt vs our synnes. And in these wordes Halowed be thy name, it is to be noted, that by the name of God, is vnderstande God hym selfe, the power of God, the myght, the maiestye, the glory, the wysedome, the prouidence, the mercye, and goodnes of God, and all such other good thynges, as in scryp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be attribute vnto God. And thys name is ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, when it is praysed, gloryfyed, sette furthe, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, and magnyfied of vs, bothe in woorde and dede.</p>
                     <p>And where in thys petytyon we praye that hys name maye be hallowed, it is not to be taken or thoughte that thys name of God, whyche in it selfe is euermore moste holy, most glorious, most meruey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louse and full of maiestye, can be eyther aduaunced or dymynished by vs, or any thyng that we can doo: but we desyre here, that thys moste holye name maye (accordynge as it is in it selfe moste holy) be so taken,

vsed honoured, and halowed of vs, and of all others as well heathen as chrystened, lyke as on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry parte, thys name is sayde to be polluted, and defy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, when we doo eyther in worde, or in deede, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelyouslye, and contemptuouslye, or otherwyse dyshonor the same. We desyre therefore in thys pety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that all false faythe, by the whyche men eyther mystrust god, or put theyr confidence in anye othere thyng more then in hym, may be destroyed. And that all wytche craftes and false charmes &amp; coniurations, by the whyche Sathan and other creatures, be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunted, maye cease; and geue place, to goddes holy name: and so lykewyse, that all heresyes, and false doctrynes, maye vanyshe awaye, so that goddes holy worde may be truely interpreted, and purely taught and sette furth, vnto al the worlde, and that all infy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels maye receyue the same, and be conuerted to the ryght catholyke faythe, whereby al disceyte, hipocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sye, and counterfaytynge of trueth, of ryghteousnesse or of holynes may clearely be extincted.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, we do beseche, and praye god here that his name may be halowed, so that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> should swere in vayne by it, or otherwyse abuse the same, to lye or deceyue hys neyghboure.

                     <p>FOr asmuche as the end, and scope, of all prayer, is onelye to obtayne thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which are good, or to be pourged preserued or delyuered, from thynges whiche are euyll. And that thys oure Lordes prayer, is not onley a moste perfecte, fruiteful, and ample prayer in sense, but also a moste perfecte fourme, where by all maner of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, eyther in parte or in the hole, are framed, or sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. Therefore after the former foure petitions, in whyche we doo aske all that good is, there doeth fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe in verye good order, the other three petitions, in whyche we doo aske the auoydynge of all euyll, as fyrst of synne commytted, and payne due to the same (it beynge the greatest euyll of all euyls).

In whych peticion we haue two proffitable lessones geuen vnto vs. The fyrste is that we should lerne al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to be lowlye, and meke in harte consideryng that we are all synners in the syghte of God. Sainct Iohn so testifyeng, in the fyrste Chapiter, of hys first epystle, and saying. If we saye that we haue no sinne, we do begyle our selfe, and there is no veritye or truthe in vs, whervnto agreeth Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the. xx. of hys prouerbes sayinge. Who can saye my harte is cleane, and I am pure from synne. And agayne he sayth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>. iiii. of Ecclesiastes. There is no manne, so good vpon the earthe, but that he synneth. And moreouer, in the. 24. of the pronerbes, he sayth. Aiuste man shall fall, seuen tymes a daye, and shall ryse agayne.</p>

The seconde lesson whyche we shoulde learne in this petition, is that the forgyuyng of other mens offenses done agaynste vs, is a cause, &amp; meanes to obteyne remissyon of our synnes, at Gods handes, accordyng where vnto our sauyoure sayeth in the. vi. of Luke. Forgeue and ye shalbe forgeuen.</p>
                     <p>And in the sixt of. Mathewe, he sayth. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb facs="tcp:25020:189"/>
to men theyr offences, than shall youre heauenlye father forgeue you, your offences and synnes. But yf you do not forgeue men neyther shall your father forgeue you youre synnes. And moreouer in the. xviii, 'of Mathewe it is wrytten howe when Peter came to our Lord, and demaunded of hym howe oft he shoulde forgeue hys brother, whyche had offended hym, and whether it was not sufficient to forgeue hym seuen tymes. Oure Lorde answered hym and sayde. I tell the Peter that thou oughtest to forgeue him not only seuen times, but seuentie times seuen times. Meanynge thereby that from tyme to tyme, we must continually forgeue oure brother, or neygheboure, wyth all our hearte, althoughe he trespasseth agaynst vs neuer so often. And Chryste also in the same place declareth the same by a parable. There was sayth Chryst, a kynge, which callyng hys seruaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes vnto an accompte, and fyndynge that one of them did owe vnto hym the summe of tenne thousand talentes, and had it not to pay, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>maunded that the saide debtor, his wife and his children, &amp; al that he had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Nowe it fortuned afterwarde <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Paye that thou owest. And the sayde seruaunte his felowe, fell vpon his knees, and prayed hym to haue pacience, promysinge to paye all, but his felowe woulde not, but caste him in to prison, vntyll all was payed. And whan the reste of his felowes, seinge this crueltye, had tolde the kinge thereof, the kynge furth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with sente for this cruell felowe, and sayde to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>. O wycked man, I Forgaue thee thy hole debte, at thy sute and request, it shoulde therefore haue beseemed the, to haue shewed like compassion, vnto thy felowe, as I she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed to the. And the kinge beynge sore dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased with this crueltye, committed hym to tormenters, that shoulde roughelye and straitelye handle him in prison, tyll he hadde payed the whole debte.</p>
                     <p>Upon this parable Chryst inferreth and sayeth. Euen so shall your heauenly father doo wyth you, if you will not forgeue euery one of you his brother, from the hearte.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:25020:190"/>Thus it appeareth playnelye, that yf we wyll be forgeuen, and wyll escape euerlastynge dampnaty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we muste putte oute of oure hearte all rancoure, malyce, and wyll to reuenge or to satysfye oure owne carnall affections, referrynge the punyshmente of the offenders, whyche in theyr offences haue trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed the lawes of God or of the prynce, to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Justyce, where of vnder God, the prynces and rulers be ministres in earthe, in whyche doynge we vtterlye forgeue our owne priuate grudge and dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure.</p>
                     <p>And yf anye peraduenture wyll thynke it to be an harde thynge, to suffer and forgeue hys enemye, whyche in woorde and deede hathe doone hym anye displeasures, lette hym consyder agayne, howe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye harde stormes oure Sauyoure Chryste suffered, and aboode for vs, what were we when he gaue hys moste precyous lyfe for vs, but horryble synners, and hys enemyes? Nowe mekelye tooke he for oure sake all rebukes, mockes, byndynge, beatynge crou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge wyth thorne, and the mooste approbryouse death, It is vndoutedlye aboue oure frayle and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupte nature to loue our enemyes that dooe hate vs and it is a deade of greater perfection then man hath of him selfe, but GOD that requireth it, wyll gyue grace that we maye doo it yf we aske and seke for it. And therefore in thys petition oure Sauyour Christ teachethe vs to aske thys grace of our heauenlye fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that we maye forgeue vs our enemyes, and that he wyll forgeue vs our trespasses, euen soo as we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geue
<pb facs="tcp:25020:191"/>
them that trespasse agaynst vs.</p>
                     <p>It is farther to be noted, that to forgeue oure brother hys faulte, is also to praye to GOD that he wyll for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geue hym and wil not impute his offence to hym and to wyshe to hym the same grace and glorye, that we desyre vnto our selues and also our selfe when occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shall comme to helpe hym, as we be bound to help our chrysten brother.</p>
                     <p>And here we thynke it expedient, that lyke as in the former parte of thys petition we haue declared, the parte and duety of hym, whyche should for chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes sake forgeue, so to declare the part and duetye of them to whom forgeuenes shoulde, be made, leaste euyll doers and noughtye mynded people myght, by the former declaration take occasyon styll to perseuer in theyr noughtye myndes an d doynges, and yet clayme for geuenes of theyr neyghbour.</p>
                     <p>Wherfore ye shal vnderstande, that forgeuenes afore spoken of, is not so mente in scrypture, that by it iustice, or lawes of prynces, shoulde be broken, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempned or not executed. For although our Sauy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chryst in thys petition doth teache vs to remytte and forgeue al iniuryes and trespasses, done agaynst vs, yet he which hathe done the iniurye, or trespasse, is neuerthelesse bounde to acknowledge hys faulte, &amp; to aske forgeuenes therefore not onelye of God, but of hym also, whom he hath offended, and to intende to doo no more so.

And for thys purpose (as S. Luke in hys fyrste Chapyter declareth) the aungell Gabryell, was sente from God to the Uyrgin Mari, with the highest message that euer was, which was to treate and conclude a leage of peace, betwene God and manne. And when thys aungell came vnto thys blessed Uirgin, he sayde these wordes. Hayleful of grace oure lorde is with the, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed arte thou amongest women. And truelye thys worde Hayle or be ioyfull, is a worde moste mete and conuenyent for the aungell, commynge on a message, to begynne hys Salutation wythall. For neuer was there Creature, that hadde soo greate and Iuste cause, to reioyse for anye Benefytte, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued

And therefore thoughte it expedient fyrste of all to vtter thys worde of Ioye, and comforte, whyche myghte also put away al feare from the blessed Uyrgynne. And by these woordes Our lorde is wyth the, is signifyed that GOD, was in the vyrgyn Mary not onelye by essence, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and presence, (as he is in all creatures) nor onely with his speciall grace (as he is in all holye men and women) but he was also in her by receyuynge of oure nature and fleshe of her substaunce, yea the hole Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie was with her by a singuler and specyall sorte, for the sonne of god was with her in that she concey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued &amp; bare him.

Is not this a hygh prerogatyue, that of all women she was chosen to be a mother to the sonne of God? And what excellent honor was she put to whan not withstandyng the decree was made of Chrystes natyuitie by the holye Trinitie, yet the thynge was not done and accomplyshed, wythoute or before her consent was graunted, for the whyche so solempne a messenger was sente? and also howe hygh grace was thys that after the defaulte made throughe the perswasion of the fyrst woman Eue, by whome Adam was brought into disobedyence, and thereby all mankynde to state of dampnation, thys blessed Uyrgyn was electe to be the instrumente, of oure reparation, in that she was chosen to beare the Sauiour and redemer of the worlde. And is not thys a wonderfull prerogatiue, to see a Uyrgyn to be a mother and conceyue her chylde wythout synne? the archaungell myghte therefore worthely saye that she the sayde Mary, was the most blessed of all other women.

Elizabethes wombe, that is to saye, Saynt Ihon Baptiste (whiche yet had scant lyfe) gaue testimonye to thys frute, that it shoulde saue hym and all the worlde, and as a prophette he dyd lepe for ioye, in his mothers wombe, and althoughe he coulde not than speake, yet neuerthelesse he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by such signes, and tokens as he coulde, that blessed was the fruyte of that wombe. And worthe ly the thyng is called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fruyte of her wombe, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the substaunce of the nature of man, whych our sauiour Chryste toke vpon hym, was taken of the nature of the moste blessed vyrgyn, and of her wombe. And so therefore it is called the fruyte, of her wombe. And he maye well be called the blessed fruyte, for that he hath saued vs, and gyuen vs lyte, contrarye to the cursed fruyte, whych Eue gaue to Adam, by whiche we were dystroyed, and broughte to deathe: But blessed is the fruyte of thys wombe, whyche is the fruyte of lyfe euerlastyng.

For wher in the creation of al other visible thinges, he did but onely commaunde, &amp; will that they should be made, and incontine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t they were made; in the creatyng of man, he vsed great solemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and many notable circumstaunces.

A wonderfull excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t benefite &amp; comfort is it vnto vs, to consyder that man was made like vnto god. And to vnderstand this thyng the better, you shall know that the similitude, and likenes of man to god, was not in the body of man (for this you must moost cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenly beleue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the godhed is a spirite, &amp; not a bodely substaunce) but this similitude and likenes was in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> soule, which was endued, with most heuenly &amp; god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like qualities, as vnderstandyng, memory, and wil; with sondry gyftes also of grace.

Which thyng as it is generally true in all creatures concerning their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, so is it in a certen degre of excellencye to be verified in man touchyng the estate of his originall innocency.

For that greuous fal of man came of synne.

For the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandyng whereof, lette vs haue recourse to the<note place="margin">Genes. 3.</note> iii. chap. of Genesis, where it is wrytten: how that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wyly serpent the deuyll came vnto Eue and sayde

Another, and seconde circumstaunce to be here considered, is that oure sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uioure, dyd aske Peter moost earnestly, whether he loued him, more than did the other apostles. And the thyrde cyrcumstaunce is, in that Chryste dyd com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mytte both hys lambes, and his shepe, vnto hym. These cyrcumstaunce (I saye) and other suche lyke, well considered, doo conuince, and clearelye proue, that the hyghe charge, ouere all the church militant, was especially committed to Peter.</p>

Agayne, in that our sauyour dyd eate of the pascall lambe with his Apostles, immediatli before he did institute this sacrament, it most playnely declareth vnto vs, that this sacrament is a marueylous worthey mysterye and that veri thing, which the eating of the paschal lambe, in the olde lawe did prefygurate, for whyche cause, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> this was instituted that was abrogated Nether is it withoute a meruelouse consideration, that Chryst at that heauenly banket, would of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, nother haue the blessed Uyrgin Mary his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, present with hym, nor anye other of his dysey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, saue onely the. xii.

Whyche poynt must be well consydered, And therefore note th at where Chryst sayde. It is impossible for a rich man to entre into the kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of heuen. (bicause y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> meaning of these wordes may be dyuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly<note place="margin">Mark. 10</note> taken, thereof) S. Marke in his tenth chapyter declareth the very meaning of them, saying: It is harde for them that trust in there substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce to be saued. Agayne Chryst at another time said to the Iewes, loose you this timple, &amp; in thre daies shal I build it againe, Andfor that the sense of these wordes is doughtfull, S.

ment his body, which should be by the Iewes put to death, and by him the thirde daye shoulde be raysed from death to lyfe. In the, viii. of Ihon, oure sauiour sayeth: He that beleueth in me, as the<note place="margin">Iohn, 7.</note> scriptnre sayeth, there shall, ryuers of quyck water flow out of him, And because this saing is obscure. S. Iohn to make it open, sayeth, that he spake those wordes, of the spirit, which they that be leued in him should receyue. In the. xii. chapiter of S, Ihon, our sauiour sayth in this maner. If I be<note place="margin">Iohn. 12.</note> lyfte vp from the earth, I wyl draw al thin ges vnto my selfe. And S, Iohn by and by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs the exposition, saying, that hereby he signy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed, what kynde of death he should suffer. Manye other lyke places are there in the newe testamente the matter of which places, is not so hyghe, nor soo nedefull to be ryghtly vnderstanded, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> meaning of these wordes, this is my body, and yet of these wordes, no one Euangelist maketh any exposition bycause the wordes are playnely, and symply to be taken as they were spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>. Besides al this, we haue in S. Paule in the, xi, Chapiter of his first Epistle, to the Corinthians, a goodly, and a large processe touching thys Sacrament, and yet in that whole processe, no matter to instructe vs otherwyse to be leue of it, than that there is in it the very body and bloude of our sauiour Chryst. For fyrste he vttereth the wordes of oursauiour, euen as the Euangelists do, as that he sayd this is my bodye. and he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no declaration vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same. Secondly where
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:25020:263"/>
none of the Euangelists make mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, of any paine due to the vnworthy receauer. S Paule affirmeth that the vnworthy receyuyng of thys Sacramente bryngeth iudgement, and dampnation, Thirdly, he telleth, that for the vnworthy receauing hereof, God plageth cities, and cuntryes, wyth sondrye greuous plages, as with infirmitye, with syckenes, and with death also. Forthely, he geueth vs counsell dylygent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye to examine and trye our selfes, before we come to gods borde. If the very body and bloude of oure sauiour Chryst, be not in dede in the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t of the aultare, why shold our sauiour so speake as he spake in the promisse made thereof? why dyd he, as he dyd in the instituting therof? why dyd none of the Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
