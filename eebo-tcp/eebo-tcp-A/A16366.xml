            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And not that these thyngs one ly are to be credyted and assented vnto, but also that all thynges els (which were taught by the Apostles, and whych haue bene by a whole vnyuersall consent of the Churche of Chryste, euer sythe that tyme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynually taught, and taken alwayes for true) ought to be receaued, accepted, taken and kepte, as a true and perfecte doctryne apostolique.</p>
                  <p>This then is the fyrst acception of fayth, whyche man hath of God, and wherein man doth not leaue to hys owne naturall knowledge (whych is by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son) but he leauethe to the knowledge attayned by fayth: wythout whych faith, man is ignoraunte and blynde, and cannot vnderstande, accordynge as the prophete Esay affirmeth in hys. vii. Chapiter, saying: <hi>Nisi credideritis, non intelligetis.</hi> That is to saye: onlesse ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue, ye shal not vnderstand. This faith is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng, the entry, and the introduction vnto all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian relygion, &amp; Godlynes: For as S. Paule sayeth in his. xi. Chapiter of his Epystle to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>. He that cometh to God must beleue that he is, and that he is a rewarde vnto them whyche do seke to please hym.</p>
                  <p>And thys fayth, although it be such a begynnynge such an entrye, and such an introduction, verye ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarye for the begynnyng of all ryghtousnes, yet yf
<pb facs="tcp:25020:6"/>
it do procede no farther, adioynyng with it, hope and charitie, it is called in Scrypture, a deade faythe, be cause it is voyde and destitute of lyfe, aud wantethe the helpe, and efficacie of charitie. And this much for fayth as it is considered in the fyrst acception.</p>
                  <p>Faythe as it is considered in the seconde accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, maye not be alone, but muste nedes haue hope, and charitie, annexed and ioyned vnto it. And faythe so taken, doth signify not onely the beleif and perswa sion whych was before mencioned in the fyrst accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and taking of fayth: but also it signifyeth a sure confydence, and hope, to attayne all whatsoeuer god hath promised for Christes sake, and it signifieth, and comprehendeth also, a hartye loue to GOD, and an obedience to his commaundementes.</p>
                  <p>And faythe thus considered, is a lyuely faythe, and worketh in man a ready submission of hys wyll to Goddes wyll. And this is the effectual fayth whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che worketh by charitie, and whyche (as S. Paule testifiet), vnto the Galathians) is of value &amp; stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gthe in Chryst Iesu.</p>
                  <p>By this fayth, Abraham, not knowyng whyther he shoulde go, went out of his countrye, and dwelte in the lande of beheste, or promyse, as in a straunge lande, lokyng, and trustyng for a cytye, founded, and buylded by almyghty God.</p>
                  <p>By this fayth also, Abraham, when he was temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, was ready to offer vp his onelye begotten sonne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:25020:7"/>And in thys sorte and wyse, faythe is taken, in the moost parte of the examples, which be recyted of S Paule, in the. xi, chap of hys Epistle to the Hebrwes</p>

                  <p>And here is to be noted and considered, that all the promyses of god, made at any tyme to man, after the fall of Adam, for Christes sake, are not absolutely and puerly made, but vnder thys condytyon, that is to saye: that man should beleue in God, and with the grace of God geuen for Chryste, endeuer hym selfe to accomplyshe, and kepe the commaundementes of God: so that yf man do beleue in God, and wythe the sayde grace, do endeuer hym selfe to the best of his po wer, to kepe and accomplyshe the sayd commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, man maye iustlie then chalenge the sayd pro mises, so graciously made vnto hym on goddes part: and if on the other side a man wil not beleue in God, and with the sayde grace endeuer hym self to the best of his power, to kepe and accomplysh the sayde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes, then man can not iustly chalenge in any wyse the sayde promyses, or the benefyte thereof, in asmuche as he hath not fulfylled and kepte on hys parte the sayde commaundementes, whyche were parte of the promyse and conuenante, made no other wyse by God vnto man, but vnder condytion, as the Prophete Dauyd playnely declareth, in the. lxxx. and lxxxviii.

In whych places man may not thinke that we be iustifyed by fayth, (as fayth is a seuerall vertue, seperated from hope, and charytie, from feare of God &amp; from repentaunce) but by fayth there is ment not the late inuented and deuised faith that is to say, onely faythe, or fayth alone, but faythe with the foresayde vertues, coupled, and ioyned to gether, conteinyng as is aforesaide the obedience to the hole doctryne and religion of Chryst.</p>
                  <p>And here by the way is to be noted, that euerye man that doth offend God, doth not vtterlye lose his fayth therby, for both they that do synne by frailtie &amp; soden motions (from which euen the iust men ar not holly free, and be taught therefore of Chryste to saye with other.

                  <p>Wherefore the truth being thus, a transgressoure of the lawe of Almyghty God, after baptysme, dothe kepe a remorse of conscience &amp; the light of knowledg by fayth, whereby he seeth the remedyes, howe to at tayne the remyssion of synne, and by a speciall gyfte of further grace, is moued to vse the same remedyes, and soo by faythe walketh the wayes ordeyned to at tayne remyssion of synne, as in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te of pe naunce shalbe more perfytlye hereafter declared.</p>

promyse made and confyrmed by an othe, of whyche thinge S. Augustine in his. clxxxi. Sermon maketh mention. And amonges them that haue a respect vn to scrypture, and the wryters thereof, a Sacrament doth signify a mistery, that is to saye, a secret or hyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den thynge apperteynyng to the religion: and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng consydered, it is sometymes taken in a more lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger signifycation, and sometymes in a more strayter: and beynge taken in the larger signification it doth signifye euerye secrete mysterye appertaynynge to religion, and euerye holy thynge hydden, thoughe it be not a sygne or token of another thyng, as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we vse to name and say, the sacrament of the godheade, meanynge thereby the very godhead it selfe, whythe is a hyd and secrete thynge, and yet not a sygne or token of any other thynge. And in this signification also S.

After which sort the sygnes and fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of the olde testamente are called sacramentes, &amp; so the auncient fathers, speakynge of the sygnes of the olde testament, do vse commonly and frequently to name them.

Nowe to consider the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnification of this worde sacrament, as it shalbe con sidered and vsed in this treatyse, (which is the moost straytest signification of al other) ye shall note, that it being so take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is defined after this sort. That is to say Asacrament is a visible signe of an inuisible grace of God, whiche grace, God effectually and certenly, doth worke in it, so that the same be duelye handled, and not vnworthelye receaued. Accordyng to which diffinition, and the worde sacrament being so taken, there are. vij. sacramentes of the churche and no mo, it is to wytte, Baptysine, Confyrmation, Penaunce, Eucharistie (or the sacrament of the aultare) Order,

And these seuen to be suche sacramentes, and mysteryes, and so truly and properly to be accepted and taken, the olde aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient fathers of the catholyke church, haue prudently and godly obserued, &amp; noted especiallye, for that they so be sensible signes of the inuisible grace of God, that they both beare the ymage, or similitude, and be also the cause of the inuisible grace of God that is geuen, Which to make more playne and manyfest vnto you let vs for declaration hereof, consider external thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And that thou shouldest lykewyse beleue, that when thou arte confyrmed, the holye Ghoste is geuen the for thy strength and force. Therefore vpon the Whytsondaye amonge the Apostels, there was made a greate sounde, and there did appeare clouen tounges as fyre, syttyng vpon the apostles. As lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse also (Actes the. ix.) by the imposition of Paules handes vpon such as were before that time baptized the holye ghoste came vpon them, yea, and they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesyed.

For they were the shadowes of thinges to come and as sygnes and fygures were abolyshed, (Chryst after his comming hauinge fulfylled them) and they were therefore abolyshed, because they were fulfylled But these of the new testament were instituted, both as greater in vertue, better in profyt, easier in myny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, and fewer in number (as beynge but seuen) and that they shoulde not onelye signifye, but purge and sanctifye also.

                        <hi>AND</hi> nowe to come vnto the other vse it is to wytte, of the receauynge of the Sacramente, ye shall note, that althoughe oure Samoure Iesus Christe, at the first institution of this sacramente, dydde minister it vnto his disciples, whiche were than presente, vnder both the kyndes of bread and wyne, Yet that fashy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and maner of ministrynge is not soo necessarye to the receauer (excepte it be to the preist, whan he doth consecrate) that without the due obseruation of that waye, man myght not receaue that blessed sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to his saluation. For the benefyte or hurte that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to a chrysten man, by receauynge of this sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente,
<pb facs="tcp:25020:86"/>
standeth not in the fashyon or maner of recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge of it, vnder one or both kyndes, but in the wor thyor vnworthy receauyng of the thynge conteyned in the same. For he that receaueth this Sacramente worthelye, vnder the one kynde, as vnder the forme of breade onely, receaueth the hole bodye and bloude of Chryst, and as many and great benefittes of Christ as he that receaueth it in both kyndes. And therefore if any man should teache, that the laye people (which by the ordinaunce and auncient custome of the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke churche, haue vsed to receaue this holy sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in fourme of breade onelye) be seduced and soo cause them to thynke, that the holle bodye and bludde of Chryst, where not comprehended in that onely forme of breade, as well as in both the kyndes, this doctrine ought vtterlye to be refused and abiected, as a verye pestiferouse and deuely she doctryne. For surely scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth the contrary, and also naturall reason, althoughe it cannot comprehende the hole mistery of this sacrament, yet herein it teacheth vs agreablye w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> scrypture, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that liuely body cannot be without bloud and therefore men ought to be ledde from that fonde opinion (yf any such be) both by that faith, and credit which they do owe vnto scripture, and in this poynt also by naturall reason. And chrysten men knowinge this, ought not to grudge at thys fourme and maner of receauyng of this sacrament vnder one kynd, vsed and allowed by the catholyke church, both to auoide that erroure afore rehersed, and also for manye other weyghtie considerations, concernynge bothe the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te, and the libertye, and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb facs="tcp:25020:87"/>
of the hole churche, seyng that not onely lay men, but also prestes (sauinge whan they do consecrate) do vse to receaue thys Sacrament none otherwyse Let chrysten men therfore humbly apply them self, to put all erronious fantasies cleane out of ther hartes, and satisfye them selues with this, that when they receiue the sacrament worthely, though it be but in one kind they loose no parte of the profyt and benefyte promy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by vertue of the sayde Sacramente. And yet to stably she this poynte (touchyng the receauing of this sacramente vnder one kynde) both with testimonies of scripture, and also otherwyse, ye shall vnderstand, that whan our sauyour Christ did delyuer this sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente vnder bothe kyndes, in the institution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he of purpose had onely his twelue Apostles with hym, to declare vnto vs that he there dyd rather pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe vnto them being preistes, how they and theyr successours should consecrate, and offer, and also they themselues in theyr ministery receaue the same, than howe it shoulde be receaued of other, not beynge of the same vocation as the Apostles were of. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was neuer yet lawfull, but very straytely to be punyshed yf a prest whan he dyd consecrate, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the same, dyd not withall receaue it vnder bothe kyndes. Wherein appearethe (the cyrcumstaunces of the institution beynge well marked and consyde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the cammaundement and charge geuen at that tyme by oure sauioure Iesus Christ, doth not of necessitie bynde the laye men, noo nor yet the preiste, (but when he sayeth masse) to receaue vnder both kin des. Therefore many tyme in Scrypture, mentyon

And as touchyng the issue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cause of marryage in that respecte, is both in honeste loue to brynge forth chyldren, and also Godlye and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously to bringe vp the same, both which causes we haue expressed and sette forth in scrypture, the fyrste Genesis, ii, where God sayeth. <hi>Faciamus ei adiutoriu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> simile si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi.</hi> That is to saye.

And here you shall note that when we aduyse you to flye euyll companye and Idlenes, we imploye therin that you shoulde alwayes haunte the companye of honest and godlye personnes, and also euer to be ententiuelye occupyed in some vertuous ex excyse or meditation.

And as concerninge these wordes, whych art in heauen. we maye not by theym vnderstande, that God is conteyned, and included wythin the heauenes, as the aungelles, and holy sayntes are, for (as Salomon sayeth in the thyrd booke of the kynges and the eyght chapyter.) The heauens of heauens doo not comprehende or include hym. But in thys respecte he is sayde to be in heauen, because he, by hys almyghtye power, doth conteyne, kepe, holde vp, and mayntayne, all the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, and also all other creatures, whyche are enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and shutte vnder the cope, or compasse of heauen accordynge as S.

Bycause that god onely as he hath made heauen, and all thynges vnder heauen, so he onely is in all the heauens, and wyth hys almyghtye power conserueth, and kepethe them in all theyr beyng. And here must we note, that we maye not thynke, that god is so in heauen, that thereby he can not be, or is not in earth also, as shall please hym selfe.

Youre rewarde is greate in heauen. And here doo you marke that these wordes, whych arte in heauen, are so placed and set furth, to styrre vp our heartes to God, and to cause in vs an inward desyre, and a greate care, and studye to come to the place where our heauenly father is: yea, and muche to couete hys syghte and presence. For lyke as a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng chylde is euer desyrous to be where hys father is, euen so oughte we euer to desyre to be wyth oure heauenlye father, and to endeuoure our selues, that our conuersation be al wythdrawen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the worlde, the fleshe, and the deuyll, and be set vpon heauen and heauenlye thynges, as S.

Psal. cxix. wofull am I, that my dwellynge vpon the earth, is soo muche prolonged. And by these wordes shoulde there be engendred in vs, a stronge hope, of eternall glorye. And howe can we fayle thereof, yf we wyll, seynge oure heauenlye father hathe bothe the wyll, and also the power to perfourme it? Hys wyll we clearelye vnderstande, in asmuche as he made hym selfe to be oure father: hys power is well knowen, for that he is a God of power, and glorye, and maker, and preseruer of Heauen, Earthe, and of
<pb facs="tcp:25020:179"/>
all that in them is. And here shall you further note y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> these wordes. Our father whych art in heauen. are put lyke a prologue before all the seuen petitions, (yea and euery one of them may haue prefixed, before them the same prologue) declaryng playnely, that no man can saye thys prayer truely, and duelye, that no pleasure of god, and hys owne meryte, excepte he haue fayth, hope, and Charytye, for wythout faythe, nor can say truelye, O father, and wy thoute cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rytye to hys neyghbour, no man cane say truelye and meritoriouslye, Oure father, and wythout hope, no man can saye truelye, Whyche arte in hauen doo thou remyt vs our synnes. And in these wordes Halowed be thy name, it is to be noted, that by the name of God, is vnderstande God hym selfe, the power of God, the myght, the maiestye, the glory, the wysedome, the prouidence, the mercye, and goodnes of God, and all such other good thynges, as in scryp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be attribute vnto God. And thys name is ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, when it is praysed, gloryfyed, sette furthe, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, and magnyfied of vs, bothe in woorde and dede.</p>
                     <p>And where in thys petytyon we praye that hys name maye be hallowed, it is not to be taken or thoughte that thys name of God, whyche in it selfe is euermore moste holy, most glorious, most meruey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louse and full of maiestye, can be eyther aduaunced or dymynished by vs, or any thyng that we can doo: but we desyre here, that thys moste holye name maye (accordynge as it is in it selfe moste holy) be so taken,

vsed honoured, and halowed of vs, and of all others as well heathen as chrystened, lyke as on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry parte, thys name is sayde to be polluted, and defy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, when we doo eyther in worde, or in deede, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelyouslye, and contemptuouslye, or otherwyse dyshonor the same. We desyre therefore in thys pety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that all false faythe, by the whyche men eyther mystrust god, or put theyr confidence in anye othere thyng more then in hym, may be destroyed. And that all wytche craftes and false charmes &amp; coniurations, by the whyche Sathan and other creatures, be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunted, maye cease; and geue place, to goddes holy name: and so lykewyse, that all heresyes, and false doctrynes, maye vanyshe awaye, so that goddes holy worde may be truely interpreted, and purely taught and sette furth, vnto al the worlde, and that all infy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels maye receyue the same, and be conuerted to the ryght catholyke faythe, whereby al disceyte, hipocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sye, and counterfaytynge of trueth, of ryghteousnesse or of holynes may clearely be extincted.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, we do beseche, and praye god here that his name may be halowed, so that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should swere in vayne by it, or otherwyse abuse the same, to lye or deceyue hys neyghboure.

                     <p>The second thyng to be considered in this petiti on is, that we doo desyre and praye, not absolutelye for breade, but we doo desyre and praye for. Oure breade.

They also are of thys sort who neyther doo laboure with their handes, nor otherwyse apply theyr study, theyr industry or diligence to some thinge whiche maye be good and profytable to the common wealthe, and to the honoure of GOD but doo lyue in case, rest, ydelnes, and wanton pleasure.

If we saye that we haue no sinne, we do begyle our selfe, and there is no veritye or truthe in vs, whervnto agreeth Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the. xx. of hys prouerbes sayinge. Who can saye my harte is cleane, and I am pure from synne. And agayne he sayth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>. iiii. of Ecclesiastes. There is no manne, so good vpon the earthe, but that he synneth. And moreouer, in the. 24. of the pronerbes, he sayth. Aiuste man shall fall, seuen tymes a daye, and shall ryse agayne.</p>

The seconde lesson whyche we shoulde learne in this petition, is that the forgyuyng of other mens offenses done agaynste vs, is a cause, &amp; meanes to obteyne remissyon of our synnes, at Gods handes, accordyng where vnto our sauyoure sayeth in the. vi. of Luke. Forgeue and ye shalbe forgeuen.</p>
                     <p>And in the sixt of. Mathewe, he sayth. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb facs="tcp:25020:189"/>
to men theyr offences, than shall youre heauenlye father forgeue you, your offences and synnes. But yf you do not forgeue men neyther shall your father forgeue you youre synnes. And moreouer in the. xviii, 'of Mathewe it is wrytten howe when Peter came to our Lord, and demaunded of hym howe oft he shoulde forgeue hys brother, whyche had offended hym, and whether it was not sufficient to forgeue hym seuen tymes. Oure Lorde answered hym and sayde. I tell the Peter that thou oughtest to forgeue him not only seuen times, but seuentie times seuen times. Meanynge thereby that from tyme to tyme, we must continually forgeue oure brother, or neygheboure, wyth all our hearte, althoughe he trespasseth agaynst vs neuer so often. And Chryste also in the same place declareth the same by a parable. There was sayth Chryst, a kynge, which callyng hys seruaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes vnto an accompte, and fyndynge that one of them did owe vnto hym the summe of tenne thousand talentes, and had it not to pay, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded that the saide debtor, his wife and his children, &amp; al that he had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Nowe it fortuned afterwarde <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Paye that thou owest. And the sayde seruaunte his felowe, fell vpon his knees, and prayed hym to haue pacience, promysinge to paye all, but his felowe woulde not, but caste him in to prison, vntyll all was payed. And whan the reste of his felowes, seinge this crueltye, had tolde the kinge thereof, the kynge furth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with sente for this cruell felowe, and sayde to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>. O wycked man, I Forgaue thee thy hole debte, at thy sute and request, it shoulde therefore haue beseemed the, to haue shewed like compassion, vnto thy felowe, as I she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed to the. And the kinge beynge sore dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased with this crueltye, committed hym to tormenters, that shoulde roughelye and straitelye handle him in prison, tyll he hadde payed the whole debte.</p>
                     <p>Upon this parable Chryst inferreth and sayeth. Euen so shall your heauenly father doo wyth you, if you will not forgeue euery one of you his brother, from the hearte.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:25020:190"/>Thus it appeareth playnelye, that yf we wyll be forgeuen, and wyll escape euerlastynge dampnaty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we muste putte oute of oure hearte all rancoure, malyce, and wyll to reuenge or to satysfye oure owne carnall affections, referrynge the punyshmente of the offenders, whyche in theyr offences haue trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed the lawes of God or of the prynce, to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Justyce, where of vnder God, the prynces and rulers be ministres in earthe, in whyche doynge we vtterlye forgeue our owne priuate grudge and dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure.</p>
                     <p>And yf anye peraduenture wyll thynke it to be an harde thynge, to suffer and forgeue hys enemye, whyche in woorde and deede hathe doone hym anye displeasures, lette hym consyder agayne, howe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye harde stormes oure Sauyoure Chryste suffered, and aboode for vs, what were we when he gaue hys moste precyous lyfe for vs, but horryble synners, and hys enemyes? Nowe mekelye tooke he for oure sake all rebukes, mockes, byndynge, beatynge crou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge wyth thorne, and the mooste approbryouse death, It is vndoutedlye aboue oure frayle and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupte nature to loue our enemyes that dooe hate vs and it is a deade of greater perfection then man hath of him selfe, but GOD that requireth it, wyll gyue grace that we maye doo it yf we aske and seke for it. And therefore in thys petition oure Sauyour Christ teachethe vs to aske thys grace of our heauenlye fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that we maye forgeue vs our enemyes, and that he wyll forgeue vs our trespasses, euen soo as we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geue
<pb facs="tcp:25020:191"/>
them that trespasse agaynst vs.</p>
                     <p>It is farther to be noted, that to forgeue oure brother hys faulte, is also to praye to GOD that he wyll for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geue hym and wil not impute his offence to hym and to wyshe to hym the same grace and glorye, that we desyre vnto our selues and also our selfe when occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shall comme to helpe hym, as we be bound to help our chrysten brother.</p>
                     <p>And here we thynke it expedient, that lyke as in the former parte of thys petition we haue declared, the parte and duety of hym, whyche should for chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes sake forgeue, so to declare the part and duetye of them to whom forgeuenes shoulde, be made, leaste euyll doers and noughtye mynded people myght, by the former declaration take occasyon styll to perseuer in theyr noughtye myndes an d doynges, and yet clayme for geuenes of theyr neyghbour.</p>
                     <p>Wherfore ye shal vnderstande, that forgeuenes afore spoken of, is not so mente in scrypture, that by it iustice, or lawes of prynces, shoulde be broken, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempned or not executed. For although our Sauy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chryst in thys petition doth teache vs to remytte and forgeue al iniuryes and trespasses, done agaynst vs, yet he which hathe done the iniurye, or trespasse, is neuerthelesse bounde to acknowledge hys faulte, &amp; to aske forgeuenes therefore not onelye of God, but of hym also, whom he hath offended, and to intende to doo no more so.

And for thys purpose (as S. Luke in hys fyrste Chapyter declareth) the aungell Gabryell, was sente from God to the Uyrgin Mari, with the highest message that euer was, which was to treate and conclude a leage of peace, betwene God and manne.

And truelye thys worde Hayle or be ioyfull, is a worde moste mete and conuenyent for the aungell, commynge on a message, to begynne hys Salutation wythall. For neuer was there Creature, that hadde soo greate and Iuste cause, to reioyse for anye Benefytte, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued

Is not this a hygh prerogatyue, that of all women she was chosen to be a mother to the sonne of God? And what excellent honor was she put to whan not withstandyng the decree was made of Chrystes natyuitie by the holye Trinitie, yet the thynge was not done and accomplyshed, wythoute or before her consent was graunted, for the whyche so solempne a messenger was sente? and also howe hygh grace was thys that after the defaulte made throughe the perswasion of the fyrst woman Eue, by whome Adam was brought into disobedyence, and thereby all mankynde to state of dampnation, thys blessed Uyrgyn was electe to be the instrumente, of oure reparation, in that she was chosen to beare the Sauiour and redemer of the worlde. And is not thys a wonderfull prerogatiue, to see a Uyrgyn to be a mother and conceyue her chylde wythout synne? the archaungell myghte therefore worthely saye that she the sayde Mary, was the most blessed of all other women.

Elizabethes wombe, that is to saye, Saynt Ihon Baptiste (whiche yet had scant lyfe) gaue testimonye to thys frute, that it shoulde saue hym and all the worlde, and as a prophette he dyd lepe for ioye, in his mothers wombe, and althoughe he coulde not than speake, yet neuerthelesse he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by such signes, and tokens as he coulde, that blessed was the fruyte of that wombe. And worthe ly the thyng is called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fruyte of her wombe, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the substaunce of the nature of man, whych our sauiour Chryste toke vpon hym, was taken of the nature of the moste blessed vyrgyn, and of her wombe. And so therefore it is called the fruyte, of her wombe. And he maye well be called the blessed fruyte, for that he hath saued vs, and gyuen vs lyte, contrarye to the cursed fruyte, whych Eue gaue to Adam, by whiche we were dystroyed, and broughte to deathe: But blessed is the fruyte of thys wombe, whyche is the fruyte of lyfe euerlastyng.

And in dede, who y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> diligently wayeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of man, can not but therin most highly laude, &amp; prayse almighty god, his creator. For wher in the creation of al other visible thinges, he did but onely commaunde, &amp; will that they should be made, and incontine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t they were made; in the creatyng of man, he vsed great solemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and many notable circumstaunces.

that they can get. Thys circumstaunce (not beyng necessary of goddes parte, as withoute the which he might haue created man) doth most mani<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>festly declare the special fauour, of almyghty god to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes mankynde: but that nexte circumstaunce, which doth immediatly folowe thys fyrst, is a more surer profe, and declaration of gods tender loue, towardes ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he sayth, Let vs make man to our owne similitude &amp; likenes, Now mark, good people, howe much god dyd for vs in our crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He made vs in very dede like vnto himselfe; &amp; in so doynge what could he haue done more for vs? A wonderfull excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t benefite &amp; comfort is it vnto vs, to consyder that man was made like vnto god. And to vnderstand this thyng the better, you shall know that the similitude, and likenes of man to god, was not in the body of man (for this you must moost cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenly beleue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the godhed is a spirite, &amp; not a bodely substaunce) but this similitude and likenes was in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> soule, which was endued, with most heuenly &amp; god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like qualities, as vnderstandyng, memory, and wil; with sondry gyftes also of grace. And here is to be noted by the way; that where almighty god sayeth, Let vs make man to our owne similitude, &amp; lykenes, he geueth vs to vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there be three parsons in trinitie, &amp; yet but one god.

Which thyng as it is generally true in all creatures concerning their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, so is it in a certen degre of excellencye to be verified in man touchyng the estate of his originall innocency. Thus we may perceaue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in the creation of man, al was excellent &amp; parfytte; whiche oughte greatly to inflame vs the more to loue and serue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God our most louynge creator.

For that greuous fal of man came of synne. Synne it was, for which God thrust man oute of paradyse; synne it was that caused the fleshe to striue agaynste the spirite, and the spirite, agaynst the fleshe; synne it was that broughte vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mankynde necessitie of bodyly death, and all the infirmities and diseases, which man in thys tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitory lyfe sustayneth; synne fynally it was, that cau sed all the posteritie of Adam and Eue to be borne in state of dampnation. But some perchaunce are desyrous fardar to knowe, by what meanes man was fyrst brought to commytte synne. For the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandyng whereof, lette vs haue recourse to the<note place="margin">Genes. 3.</note> iii. chap. of Genesis, where it is wrytten: how that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wyly serpent the deuyll came vnto Eue and sayde

For God knowethe that whatsoeuer daye you shall eate thereof, youre eyes shalbe opened, and you shalbe like Gods, knowynge good and euyll.

If charity requyre to thinke, speake, and doo well vnto euery man, bothe good and euyl, how can magystrates execute iustyce vpon malefactoures, with charytye? Howe can they caste euyll men into prison, take away theyr goodes, and sometyme theyr lyues, accordynge to lawes: yf Charytye <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> not suffer them so to doo? Herevnto, is a plaine and brief answer, that plages and punishementns be not euel of them selues, yf they be well taken of innocentes: and to an euyll man, they are bothe good and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarye: and may be executed accordynge to charitye, and with charity should be executed.

Els they loue neyther God, nor them whome they gouerne, yf for lacke of correction, they wylfully suffer God to be offended, and them whom they gouerne, to perishe. For as euery louyng father correcteth his natural sonne, when he dothe amysse, or els he loueth hym not: So all gouernoures of Realmes, Countreys, Townes, and houses, should louynglye correcte them, who be offendours vnder theyr gouernaunce.

And cheryshe them who doo lyue innocently: yf they haue any respecte, eyther vnto God, and theyr office or loue vnto them, of whome they haue gouernauce,</p>
                  <p>And suche rebukes, and punyshementes, of them that doo offende, must be done in due tymes, least by delaye, the offender fall headlinges into al maner of myschiefe, and not onelye bee euyll theim selues, but also doo hurte vnto many men, drawynge other by theyr euyll example, to synne, &amp; outrage, after them.

Therefore beare welaway thys one shorte lesson, that by true christian charitye God ought to be loued, aboue all thynges, and all men oughte to be loued, good and euyll, frende, and foo, and to al suche we ought (as we may) doo good those that be good, of loue we ought to encorag, and

He sayde vnto him feede my shepe. Thys processe of Scripture, hath in it, many circumstaunces to be noted. The fyrst is, that (other Apostles beynge than present, and amongest them, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he of whom Chryst did eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> make very much of, that is to say, S.

Another, and seconde circumstaunce to be here considered, is that oure sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uioure, dyd aske Peter moost earnestly, whether he loued him, more than did the other apostles. And the thyrde cyrcumstaunce is, in that Chryste dyd com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mytte both hys lambes, and his shepe, vnto hym. These cyrcumstaunce (I saye) and other suche lyke, well considered, doo conuince, and clearelye proue, that the hyghe charge, ouere all the church militant, was especially committed to Peter.</p>

Manye other lyke places are there in the newe testamente the matter of which places, is not so hyghe, nor soo nedefull to be ryghtly vnderstanded, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> meaning of these wordes, this is my body, and yet of these wordes, no one Euangelist maketh any exposition bycause the wordes are playnely, and symply to be taken as they were spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Besides al this, we haue in S.
