            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This I thought an unkind Treatment after all my faithful and ſignal Services done for the City. And if in this Particular Inſtance my Zeal did exceed my Diſcretion in expoſing my ſelf to the Anger and Cenſure of the Court of Aldermen; yet I did not herein go beyond the Bounds of Truth, nor had or could have any other End or Deſign in it, than for the Benefit and Service of the City; and therefore might have Challenged a more Favourable Conſtruction. The ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee had an other Opinion of me, and were ſo well ſatisfied with my Service done for the City, that they out of their own Generoſity (without any Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of mine) gave me One Hundred Guineas, and ſome of them thought I deſerved a far greater Reward. And I was Imployed by them in City Buſineſs long after this Order was made, until ſuch Time as the City Beams were Lett to Farm, and the ſaid Committee diſcontinued.</p>
            <p>The Lord Mayors may hereafter again ſell the Coal and Corn-Meeters Place, and the Court of Aldermen grant away the Fees and Profits thereof, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the late ACT of Common-Council to the contrary, with the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Juſtice as they could Grant away from the City the Fees and Profits of the Common Beams, ſince the making of the aforeſaid ACT in the Year <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>1. And therefore the ſetting forth theſe Matters in a due Light, can never be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged Scandalous, Malicious or Criminal by any Good Magiſtrate or Citizen, which is all Colonel <hi>Peirce</hi> hath to Alledge or Charge againſt me. He takes no Notice of his Endeavouring to defeat the City of 800 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> Rent, in the Buſineſs of the Scavage, by a Preſent of a Thouſand Guineas to Sir <hi>Henry Tulſe,</hi> nor of the Nineteen Guineas he hath promiſed me upon the Confirmation of his Contract with the Committee. What he ſaith as to the Guinea he gave me is falſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> That the ſaid Committee not only Recover'd from the Farmers of the Markets the full Rents reſerved in their Leaſe, and Relieved the Market People that were then Oppreſſed: But got an Award, founded upon a Rule of the Court of <hi>Queen's-Bench,</hi> made by the Honourable Sir <hi>Nathan Wright,</hi> the now Lord Keeper, and Sir <hi>Bartholomew Shower,</hi> with the Approbation of the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Holt;</hi> by which all Matters in Difference between the City Farmers and the Market People are Regulated for the future, which Award his Lordſhip commended to be Inrolled at <hi>Guild-Hall.</hi> Which if it had been done, and were duly obſerved, would be of great Uſe to the City, and Market People.</p>
            <p>Thus have I ſet forth a ſhort State of my CASE in Reference to my Service done for the City, and the different Treatment I have met with: All which I ſubmit to the Wiſdom and Juſtice of this Honourable Court.</p>
