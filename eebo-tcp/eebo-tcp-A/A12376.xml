            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

chooſe fit and proper textes
to ſpeake that which I would

my ſelf what doctrine were fitteſt for you,
I ſought for a text which ſpeakes againſt
couetouſneſſe, which I may call the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doners

you more then other, whiche ſhould turne
couetouſneſſe into thankefulneſſe, yet as
the Iuie groweth with the Oke, ſo coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe
hath growen with riches: euerie
man wiſheth the Philoſophers ſtone, and
<pb facs="tcp:11211:2"/>
who is within theſe wals that thinkes he

that haue to much?<note place="margin">Exod. 16. 2.</note> As y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iſraelites mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured
as muche when they had Mamma
as when they were without it,<note place="margin">Nom. 11. 4</note> ſo they
which haue riches couet as much as they
which are without them: that conferring
your mindes and your wealth together, I
may truly ſay, this Citie is rich, if it were
not couetous. This is the deuil which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witcheth
you, to thinke that you haue not
enough, when you haue more then you
neede. If you cannot chooſe but couet ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
I will ſhewe you riches which you
may couet. <hi>Godlineſſe is great riches.</hi>
In which words, as <hi>Iacob</hi> craued of his
wiues and his ſeruants to giue him their
Idols,<note place="margin">Cene. 35. 4</note> that hee might burie them, ſo
<hi>Paule</hi> craueth your couetouſneſſe, that
hee might burie it: and that yee might be
no looſers hee offereth you the vantage,
in ſtead of gaine, hee propoſeth great
gaine. <hi>Godlineſſe is great gaine:</hi> as if
hee ſhoulde ſay, Will you couet little
gayne before great? You haue found little
ioy in money, you ſhall finne great ioy in
<pb facs="tcp:11211:3"/>
the holy Ghoſt: you haue founde little
peace in the world, you ſhall finde great
peace in conſcience. This ſeeing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world

<hi>Naboth</hi> cannot holde his owne,<note place="margin">1. King. 21. 4.</note> becauſe
ſo manie <hi>Achabs</hi> are ſicke of his vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard:
when he hath found the diſeaſe, like
a ſkilfull Phiſtian, hee goeth about to
picke out the greedie worme whiche ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
men ſo hungry, and ſets ſuch a glaſſe
before them, that will make a ſhilling
ſeeme as great as a pound, a cottage

which hath but twentie poundes, ſhall be
as merrie as hee which hath an hundred,
and hee whiche hath an hundred, ſhall be
as iocund as hee which hath a thouſand:
and he which hath a thouſand: ſhall be
as well contented, as hee whiche hath
a miſſion: euen as <hi>Daniel</hi> did thriue with
water and pulſe,<note place="margin">Dan. 1. 12.</note> as well as the reſt did
with their wine and iunkets. This is the
<pb facs="tcp:11211:3"/>
vertue and operation of theſe wordes: if
you heare them with the ſame ſpirite that
<hi>Paule</hi> wrote them, they will ſo worke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your heartes, that you ſhall goe away
euery man contented with that which hee
hath, like <hi>Zacheus,</hi> which before hee had
ſeene Chriſt,<note place="margin">Luke. 19. 8.</note> knew nothing but to ſcpane,
but as ſoone as hee had heard Chriſt, all
his mind was ſet vpon giuing: this was
not the firſt day that <hi>Zacheus</hi> ſeemed rich
to others, but this was the firſt day that
<hi>Zacheus</hi> ſeemed rich vnto himſelf, when
riches ſeemed dung, &amp; Godlineſſe ſeemed
riches. Chriſt doth not will other to giue
all their goods away to the poore, as hee
bad the yoong man,<note place="margin">Mat. 19. 21.</note> to ſee what he would
doe, but he which forbad him to keepe his

When thau ſhouldſt giue, ſhe ſaith
it is too much: when thou ſhould receaue,
ſhe ſaith it is too litle: when thou ſhould
remit, ſhe ſaith it is too great: when thou
ſhould repent, ſhe ſaith it is to ſoone: when
thou ſhould heare, ſhee ſaith it is to farre:
like <hi>Pharao</hi> whiche found one buſineſſe or
other to occupie the <hi>Iewes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 5, 6.</note> when they
ſhould ſerue God.</p>
            <p>Thus euery labour hath an ende, but
couetouſneſſe hath none, like a ſuiter
in law which thinkes to haue an end
this fearne and that tearme, and the
lawyer which ſhuld procure his peace
prolongeth his ſtrife, becauſe he hath
an action to his purſe, as his aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie
hath to his land: ſo hee which is
ſet on coueting doth drinke brine
whiche makes him thirſt more, and
ſeeth no hauen till he arriue at death:
when he hath lied, hee is readie to lye
agayne: when he hath ſworne, hee is
readie to ſweare againe: when he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
he is readie to deceiue again: when
the day is paſt, he would it were to begin
again: When the tearme is ended, he wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth
<pb facs="tcp:11211:5"/>
that it were come againe: and
though his houſe be full, and his ſhop
ful, and his coffers ful, and his purſe
full, yet his heart is not full, but
lanke and emptie, like the diſeaſe
which wee cal the Woolfe, that is
alwaies eating, and yet keepes the
body leane. The Ant dooth eat the
foode which ſhée findeth: the Lyon
doth refreſh himſelfe with the pray
that hée taketh, but the couetous
man lieth by his money as a ſicke
man ſits by his meate, and hath no
power to take it, but to looke vpon
it, like the Prince to whome <hi>Eliſha</hi>
ſaid that he ſhould ſee the corne with
his eies, but none ſhuld come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his mouth. Thus the couetous
man makes a foole of himſelfe. Hee
coueteth to couet: hée gathereth to
gather: hée laboureth to labour: he
careth to care, as though his office
were to fill a coffer full of angels,
and then to dy, like an aſſe which ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth
treaſures on his back all day,
<pb facs="tcp:11211:6"/>
and at night they are taken from
him, which dyd him no good but
lode him, Howe happie were ſome
if they knewe not golde from lead?
<hi>If thou be vviſe</hi> (ſayth <hi>Salomon) thou
ſhalt bee vviſe for thy ſelfe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prou. 9. 12.</note> but hée
which is couetous, is couetous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
himſelfe. For what plague
is this (vnleſſe one woulde kill
himſelfe) for a man to ſpend all his
life in carking, and pining, and ſcra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
(as though hee ſhoulde doo
nothing but gather in this world, to
ſpend in the next) vnleſſe he be ſore
that he ſhall come againe when hee
is dead, to eate thoſe ſcraps which
hee hath gotten with all this ſtyrre?
Therefore couetouſneſſe may well
bee called miſerie, and the couetous
miſerable, for they are miſerable
indeed.</p>
            <p>Of them which ſéeme to bee wiſe,
there be no ſuch fooles in the world
as they which loue money better
then themſelues, but this is a iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:11211:6"/>
of God, that they which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue

&amp; liue like <hi>Cain</hi> which was a vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond
vpon his owne landes,<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 14.</note> ſo they
are beggers in the middeſt of their
wealth. For though they haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
to know riches, and a
minde to ſeeke them, and wit to
finde them, and pollicie to keepe
them, and life to poſſeſſe them, yet

hée leaues out <hi>Many,</hi> and prayeth in

<hi>Gaine.</hi> As the Father calleth his
ſonne which hee would loue more

put him in minde of ſuch a loue as
he beareth to himſelf. Here we may
ſee that God dooth not commannd
men to be godly onely, becauſe it
makes for his glory, but becauſe
Godlineſſe is profitable to vs. For
Godlines is not called Gaine in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of him, but in reſpect of vs: it
is gain to vs, but it is dutie to him.
So it is not called health in reſpect
of God, but in reſpect of vs, becauſe
it is the health of the ſoule. ſo it is
not called a kingdome in reſpect of
<pb facs="tcp:11211:11"/>
God, but in reſpect of vs, becauſe
we are intituled to the kingdome
by this difference from the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates.
But all the good thinges in
the world together, and the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of all is found in Godlineſſe:
and therefore godlineſſe is called
by the names of thoſe thinges that
men count. beſt, to ſhewe that the
Godlie are as well, as merrie, as
content with their loue towarde
God, and Gods loue toward them,
as other are with health, and
wealth, and pleaſures. Therefore
it is ſaid of the Godly. <hi>Eſay. 33. The
feare of the Lord is his treaſure.</hi>
Therefore ſaith <hi>Ieremy, 3. Lament.
<hi>The Lord is my portion.</hi>
               </hi> as though
he deſired nothing els: and therfore
it is ſaid of <hi>Moſes. Heb. 11. 26. <hi>That
he eſteemed the rebuke of Chriſt
greater riches the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al the treaſures of

               </hi> If croſſes be riches, as <hi>Moſes</hi>

but is this al? ſhal godlines be

our riches in this life only. Nay
(ſaith <hi>Paule, 1. Tim,</hi> 4) <hi>Godlineſſe
hath the promiſes of this life and of
the life to come.</hi> And therfore chriſt
ſaith, <hi>Firſt ſeeke the kingdome of

riches wer caſt to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they knewe

For all good thinges were created
for the good, and therefore they are
called <hi>good. Gen,</hi> 1. Becauſe the
good God created them for good
men to good purpoſe:<note place="margin">Gene. 25. 30 Gen. 27. 8</note> and therfore
as <hi>Iacob</hi> got the bleſsing, ſo he got
the inheritance alſo: to ſhew that
as the faithfull haue the inwarde
bleſſing, ſo they haue the outward
bleſſings too, when they are good

better then wee what is good for

<hi>Take you no care, for my father ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
for you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hee was not content to call
<hi>Godlineſse gain,</hi> but hee calleth
it <hi>great gaine,</hi> as if hee would ſay
Gaine, and more then Gaine: ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and better then riches: a

            <p>As when the Prophetes woulde
diſtinguiſh betweene the Idol gods

Godlineſſe is called greate gaine.
The riches of the worlde are called
earthlye, tranſitorye, ſnares,
thornes, dung, as though they
were not worthye to bee counted
Riches: and therefore to draw the
earneſt loue of men from them,
the holy Ghoſte bringes them in
with ſuch names of diſdaine, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
them with their louers: but
<pb facs="tcp:11211:13"/>
when hee comes to Godlineſſe,
which is the riches of the ſoule, he
calleth it great riches, heauenlye
riches, vnſearcheable riches, euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
riches, with all the names
of honor, and al the names of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and all the names of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
As a woman trimmes and
deckes her ſelfe with an hundred
ornaments, onelye to make her
amiable, ſo the holy Ghoſt ſetteth
out Godlineſſe with names of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and names of pleaſure, and
names of happineſſe, as it were in
her iewels with letters of commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
to make her to hee loued.
Leaſt any riches ſhoulde compare
with Godlineſſe, hee giues it a
name aboue other, and calleth it
Great Riches, as if, hee woulde
make a diſtinction betweene Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches

gaine of Couetouſneſſe, and the
gain of Godlineſſe, the peace of the

the ioy of riches, and the ioy of the

a kind of peace, and ioy, and riches,
but I cannot call it <hi>great,</hi> becauſe
they haue not enough, they are not

               </gap>ine, ſuch ioy, ſuch peace is in

it: for this is the qualitie of vertue,
it ſeemeth nothing vnto a man vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til

he boaſteth of his peniworths, and
ſaith it is better, then his mony. So
Godlines, before a man haue it, hee
ſaith it is not woorth his labor, and
thinkes euery houre too much that
he ſpendeth about it, but when hee

becauſe we ſéek contentation in the

Godlines is in the mind, and the
gaine of Godlines is contentation.
The apoſtle ſpeakes as though hée

fed fiue thouſand perſons, and yet
there were twelue baſkets full of
that which was left, which coulde
not fill one baſket when it was
whole: ſo their litle feaſt was made
a great feaſt: ſo the godlye though
they haue but litle for themſelues,
yet they haue ſomething for other,
like the wyddowes Myte, that they
may ſay as the Diſciples ſaide to<note place="margin">Mark. 12.</note>
Chriſt,<note place="margin">Math. 10</note> they want nothing, though
they haue nothing. Contentation
wanteth nothing, and a good heart
is worth all: For if ſhe want bread,
ſhe can ſay as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>I am ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bread:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn. 4. 32.</note> If ſhe want riches, ſhe
can ſay, I haue other riches: If
ſhee want ſtrength, ſhe can ſay, I
haue other ſtrength: If ſhee want
friends, ſhe can ſay, I haue other
<pb facs="tcp:11211:16"/>
friends. Thus the Godly and all
within, that the Godleſſe ſéek with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.
Therfore if you ſée a man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with that which hée hath, it
is a great ſigne that Godlineſſe is
entred into him, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hart of man
was made a Temple for God, and
nothing can fill it but God alone.
Therefore <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith after his con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerſion
that which he coulde neuer
ſay before his conuerſion,<note place="margin">Phil. 4.</note> 
               <hi>I haue
learned to be conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,</hi> Firſt he lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
godlines, then godlines taught
him contentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Now (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>)
<hi>I haue learned to be content,</hi> as
though this were a leſſon for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Chriſtian to learn, <hi>to be content</hi>
For thus he muſt thinke, that as
God ſaid to <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he coulde
not obtaine leaue to goe to <hi>Canaan,
Let this ſuffice thee to ſee Canaan:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 26.</note>
ſo whatſoeuer he giueth, he giueth
this charge with it, <hi>Let this ſuffice
thee.</hi> As <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſaith, <hi>This is my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
and I vvil beare it,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 10. 19</note> ſo thou muſt
<pb facs="tcp:11211:17"/>
ſay, This is my portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; I wil take
it. This is the ſigne, whether God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines
be in a man, if he haue ioy of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
which he hath: for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thinges which
god giueth to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> righteous, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he giueth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to enioy, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 17.
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, if he haue much, he can ſay with
<hi>Paul, I haue learned to abound:</hi> if he
haue litle, he can ſay with <hi>Paule, I
haue learned to vvant:</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, if he haue
much as <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp; <hi>Lot,</hi> &amp; <hi>Iacob,</hi> &amp;
<hi>Iob,</hi> and <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> yet it cannot corrupt
his mind, but as the net was ful of
fiſhes, and yet did not rent, becauſe
they caſt it in at Chriſts co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund:<note place="margin">Iohn. 21. 11.</note>
ſo though y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godly man be full of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
yet his heart is not rent, his
mind is not troubled, his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
is not chaunged, becauſe hée reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theſe thinges were geuen
him to doo good, as <hi>Heſter</hi> thought of
her honor: if hée haue litle,<note place="margin">Heſt. 4. 14.</note> it is like
the litle oyle, which ſerued the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
as little as it was,<note place="margin">2. King. 4. 7.</note> 
               <hi>For a litle to

               <note place="margin">Pſal. 34.</note> (ſaith <hi>Dauid</hi>) <hi>is better
<pb facs="tcp:11211:17"/>
then great riches to the vngodly:</hi> for
when a man hath found y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heauenly
riches, hee careth not for earthly ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
no more then he that walketh
in the Sun, thinks not whether the

w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſt (<hi>Math.</hi> 5)<note place="margin">Mat. 5</note> 
               <hi>Bleſſed are

which thirſt after honour, nor they
which thirſt after pleaſure, they ſhal
not be ſatiſfied, but thirſt more, as
the ambitious, voluptuous and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous
do, but they <hi>that thirſt after
righteouſnesſhalbe ſatisfied,</hi> though
they haue no riches, nor honor, nor
pleaſure:<note place="margin">Gen. 2</note> euen as <hi>Adam</hi> was warm
though he had no cloaths, though he
was naked, yet he did not ſée his na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kednes,
ſo long as he was innocent:
but when he began to rebel, then he
began to want cloaths, ſo thogh a man
be pore, yet he doth not ſee his pouerty
<pb facs="tcp:11211:18"/>
ſo long as hee is contented, but
when hee beginnes to couet, then
he beginnes to want riches, and
from that day the curſe (in the firſt
of <hi>Agge.</hi> 6.) takes holde vpon him,
<hi>Ye eat, but ye haue not inough: ye
drinke, but ye are not ſatisfied: ye
cloath your ſelues but ye are not
vvarme.</hi> Indeed the couetous man
ſéemeth to drawe the world to him
with cordes, his coffers are of lode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones,
his handes like nettes, his
fingers like lime-twigges, there it
comes, and there it comes, one

that hee might ſay Riches gaine
reſt aſwell as Godlineſſe, but ſee
what happened that night when he
began to take his reſt, riches &amp; reſt,
and ſoule and all were taken from
him. Did he not gaine faire? would
<pb facs="tcp:11211:18"/>
he haue taken ſuche paines if hee had
thought of ſuch reſt, couetouſneſſe may
gaine riches, but it cannot gaine reſt,
ye may thinke iike this churle to reſt,
when your barnes and ſhoppes and

true which <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Eſay. 41.</note> 
               <hi>there is no reſt
to the vngodly,</hi> therefore the wiſe

though he had tried,<note place="margin">Pro. 12. 3.</note> 
               <hi>a man cannot be

hee cannot be quieted nor ſatiſfied by
the gaine of deceipt, or bribes, or lies,
or vſurie,<note place="margin">Pro. 10. 2.</note> which is iniquitie: therefore
bleſſed is the man whome godlineſſe

<hi>Salomon) he doth ad no ſorrovv to

               <note place="margin">Pro. 13. 6</note> but (ſaith he) <hi>the reuenevves of the

riches at leaſt which wee muſt dwell
with, when all the reſt which wee haue
lied for, and ſworne for, and fretted for,
and coſoned for, and broken our ſleepe,
and loſt many ſermons, forſake vs.
Like ſeruauntes which chaunge theyr
maiſters: then <hi>godlineſſe ſhall ſeeme
as great gaine</hi> to vs as it did to <hi>Paul,</hi>
and hee which loued the worlde moſte,
would giue all that he hath for a dram
of faith, that he might be ſure to go to
heauen when hee is dead, though hee
went towardes hell ſo long as hee
liued.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid of this citie that manie citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
of <hi>London</hi> haue good willes, but
bad deedes, that is, you doe no good

            <p>Firſt you are vngodly, that you may

of your riches to excuſe for your vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſſe,
it may be, that ſome heere
haue ſet down in their willes, when I

giue not more when you are at that
poynt,<note place="margin">Mat. 27. 3</note> for <hi>Iudas</hi> when hee died retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
all agayne: ſo yee die and thinke
when ye are goue, that God wil take
this for a quittance: bee not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
for God doth not looke vppon that
whiche yee doe for feare, but vpon
that which yee doe for loue. If you can
finde in your heart to doe good while
yee are in healthe, as <hi>Zacheus</hi> did,
then God hathe reſpect vnto your of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,

and the fruits of couetouſneſſe
if yee bee couetous you ſhall neuer
