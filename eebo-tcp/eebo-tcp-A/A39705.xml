            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Let us do then in these times as I have seen the wiser sort of passengers doe in <hi>Holland</hi> ships, when the weather has been a little foul, get under hatches, and make our selves as merry as we can, whilst for those busie bodies, who will needs be talking and medling above decks, I have seen the skipper with a good ropes end sometimes, courteously intreat them to go down and not trouble them.</p>

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>BEtwixt Poetry &amp; Painting there is neer relation, Poetry being but a speaking Picture, as Painting a silent Poem. So have you Poets and Painters excellent in their several kindes. For your <hi>Virgil,</hi> or Heroique Poet, a <hi>Raphael,</hi> and <hi>Titian.</hi> For your <hi>Horace,</hi> or <hi>Lyrique,</hi> a <hi>Holbeen,</hi> and <hi>Vandick,</hi> representing particular persons to the life; as for your Burlesque, or Drol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Poem, a <hi>Brughel,</hi> and (in his kinde) <hi>Callot,</hi> representing Grotesque &amp; fantastick figures. In which way there has been fewer excellent than in any other, as being the most witty and ingenious, your other putting you too much on the gravity, to be alwaies witty, and having somewhat else to sustaine the dignity of the person when that failes; but here wit is all, which failing once, the work presently falls flat, and the Author has nothing left for his support,
<pb facs="tcp:57105:4"/>
whose part 'tis to sustain the matter, and not the matter him.</p>
            <p>Of this kinde is the Poem I present thee here, which when its figures are lively, and representations naturall, is one of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfullest of all; where note, that as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions grow more polite and witty, they fall upon this strain, it being the luxuriant branches of a flourishing language, and the very interiour of it, beyond the accesse of vulgar wits, whither (as in <hi>China</hi>) no stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger can arrive. So your <hi>Dutch,</hi> and more Northern nations, could never get past <hi>Iack puddings,</hi> or <hi>Pickle-herrings,</hi> stale jests yet, which none but <hi>Beer brewers</hi> can laugh at, whilst your severest <hi>Statesmen,</hi> and refinedst <hi>Wits</hi> can laugh at these.</p>
            <p>That I use some broad words sometimes, 'tis but conform to the pattern I imitate: <hi>Brughel</hi> representing, without any dishone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, here a <hi>Boor</hi> shiting, there a <hi>Boorinne</hi> pis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, to render the vulgar more ridiculous <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>are properly the subject of ridiculousness) and whose follies, abuses, and vices, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the subject of Satyre: for the rest never was <hi>Indian</hi> contriving feathers intopicture,
<pb facs="tcp:57105:4"/>
more careful of their shadows, than I not to give <hi>umbrage</hi> unto any, who reverence Authority, honour all noble Persons, and especially am a devoted servant unto La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; yet to think to satisfie all objections, were to think to peel a <hi>Bulbus</hi> root to its last rinde, or sweep an Earthen floor to its last grain of dust, especially here, where they understand <hi>railing,</hi> farre better than <hi>Raillery.</hi> Now if you ask me why I prefix not my name to this, as well as to my other works: besides, that I count it the slightest of them all, 'tis because those I printed only to communicate to my private friends, but intending to make this more publique, and hating to have my name lie glaring on Book-sellers stalls, I have purposely sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed it here; yet so, as I care not (for sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying thy curiosity) to take thee aside from the Title-page, &amp; tell thee my name is <hi>Richard Fleckno.</hi>

               <lg>
                  <l>And think withall how it would puzzle</l>

               <head>On the Author of that base infamous Libel, lately writ against some Ladies of the town.</head>
               <lg>
                  <l>I Wonder where the Devil thou</l>
                  <l>Found'st language for to write so low?</l>
                  <l>Ballad-maker compar'd to thee</l>
                  <l>Might <hi>Waller,</hi> best of Poets, be.</l>
                  <l>Hadst never a waterman for friend,</l>
                  <l>That might thee handsome railing lend,</l>
                  <l>Nor Oyster wench, nor Fish-wife might</l>
                  <l>Assist thy Muse whilst thou didst write,</l>
                  <l>Nor Blew-coat-servingman (at least)</l>
                  <l>Might furnish thee with some stale jest,</l>
                  <l>But thou must write such wicked stuff,</l>
                  <l>None can condemn nor damn enough,</l>
                  <l>Where there's nor Prose nor Meetre neither,</l>
                  <l>But dregs and lees of both together.</l>
                  <l>We see in viands which we eat,</l>
                  <l>The Sawce sometimes commends the Meat;</l>
                  <l>But thou for seasoning what th'ast writ,</l>
                  <l>Hast not a dram of sense nor wit,</l>
                  <l>Nor ought we may as much as call</l>
                  <l>Insipid, but meer stinking all.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>For Bawdry then thou offer'st at,</l>
                  <l>It is so impotent and flat,</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:57105:63"/>It shewes thy Muse a Prostitute</l>
                  <l>That would ('tis true) but cannot do't.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>This of thee's my opinion now,</l>
                  <l>If what the Ladies is thou't know,</l>
                  <l>They say the end a Poet has,</l>
                  <l>Being commonly to write for praise,</l>
                  <l>They ne're knew any one but thee</l>
                  <l>Did write before, for infamy;</l>
                  <l>Those then are sorry and asham'd,</l>
                  <l>Onely whom thou hast not nam'd,</l>
                  <l>Should count it high indignity,</l>
                  <l>Even to be prais'd by such as thee:</l>
                  <l>Nor is this (I'd have thee know)</l>
                  <l>Impudence, but judgement now;</l>
                  <l>Thy Rhimes are all so leud and base,</l>
                  <l>Write to thine own, not their disgrace.</l>
                  <l>None then thy name inquireth after,</l>
                  <l>Nor in anger, nor in laughter,</l>
                  <l>Nor does think thee worth a banging,</l>
                  <l>Nor a whipping, nor a hanging;</l>
                  <l>Whence whatsoe're is thy abuse,</l>
                  <l>It in thy basenesse findes excuse:</l>
                  <l>So if thou't have thy name forgot,</l>
                  <l>Thou maist write still, and spare them not:</l>
                  <l>If not, the more severer sort</l>
                  <l>Do wish thee fairely hanged for't,</l>
                  <l>And after sung in Ballad-rhime,</l>
                  <l>Almost as villanous as thine:</l>
                  <l>Mean while, if thou but holdest on</l>
                  <l>Thy railing style as th'ast begun,</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:57105:64"/>Ile give thee this encouragement,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>England</hi> no longer shall lament</l>
                  <l>Its scarcity of wood and tree,</l>
                  <l>For other cause but beating thee.</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>THis is to let thee understand</l>
                  <l>I'm deeply in love with Mrs. <hi>Anne,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>And would for more than onely meeter,</l>
                  <l>That I could say the deeper th' sweeter;</l>
                  <l>For I'm in love in such a fashion,</l>
                  <l>'Tis even as good as a purgation.</l>
                  <l>And now I thus much have exprest,</l>
