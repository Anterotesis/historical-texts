            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N theſe words
hee compares
the heart unto
ſome houſe of
common reſort, made as
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:150618:6"/>
it were with many and
large roomes to entertaine
and lodge multitudes of
Gueſts in; into which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
converſion, all the
vaine, light, wanton, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane,
diſſolute thoughts,
that poſte up and downe
the World (as your
thoughts doe) and runne
riot all the day, have free,
open acceſſe, the heart
keeps open houſe to them,
gives them willing, cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
welcome, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment;
accompanies,
them, travels o're all the
world for the daintieſt
pleaſures to feed them
with; <hi>Lodgeth,</hi> harbours
them, and there they, like
unruly Gallants, and roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
<hi>lodge,</hi> and revell it
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:150618:6"/>
day and night, and defile
thoſe roomes they lodge
in, with their loathſome
filth and vomits. <hi>How long,</hi>
ſayes the Lord, <hi>ſhall they
lodge therein? Whilſt I</hi>
with my Spirit, my Sonne,
and traine of graces, <hi>ſtand
at the doore and knock, Rev.</hi>
3. 20. and cannot finde
admittance; of all which
filthineſſe, &amp;c. the <hi>Heart</hi>
this houſe muſt be <hi>waſhed;
waſh thy heart from wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
Waſht,</hi> not ſwept
onely of groſſer evills (as
<hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 43. the <hi>houſe,
(the uncleane ſpirit re-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
into</hi>) is ſaid to bee
ſwept of evills that lay
looſe and uppermoſt) but
<hi>waſht,</hi> and clenſed of thoſe
defilements which ſticke
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:150618:7"/>
more cloſe, and are incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated,
and wrought in,
into the Spirit. And 2.
thoſe <hi>vaine</hi> and unruly
gueſts muſt bee turned out
of doores, without any
warning, they have ſtaid
there long enough; too
long; <hi>How long?</hi> and the
<hi>time paſt may ſuffice,</hi> as the
Apoſtle ſpeaks, they muſt
lodge there no more. The
houſe, the ſoule is not in
converſion to bee puld
downe, but onely theſe
gueſts turned out; and
though kept out they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be, they will ſtill enter
whilſt wee are in theſe
houſes of clay, yet lodge
they muſt not: if thoughts
of anger and revenge
come in, in the morning or
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:150618:7"/>
day time, they muſt bee
turned out e're night, <hi>Let
not the Sunne goe downe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your wrath, Epheſ.</hi> 4. 26.
For ſo you may come to
lodge yet a worſer gueſt
in your heart with them:
<hi>Give not place to the Devil,</hi>
(for it followes) who will
<hi>bring ſeven worſe with him.</hi>
If uncleane thoughts offer
to come to bed to thee,
when thou lieſt downe, let
them not lodge with thee.
To conclude, it is not
what thoughts are in your
hearts, and paſſe through
them, as what lodging
they have, that doth diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
your repentance:
many good thoughts and
motions may paſſe, as
<hi>Strangers</hi> thorow a bad
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:150618:8"/>
mans heart; and ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
multitudes of vaine
thoughts may make a
thorow-fare of a belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
heart, and diſturbe
him in good duties, by
knockings and interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and breakings in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the heart of a good
man; but ſtill they lodge
not there; are not foſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
harboured.</p>
            <p>My ſcope in our ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
courſe is, to diſcover
the wickedneſſe and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the heart by nature:
in the heart we are yet but
in the upper parts of it, the
underſtanding, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filements
thereof, which
are to bee waſht out of it,
and the next defilement,
which in my broken or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:150618:8"/>
I meane to handle, is
that which is here ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>the vanity of your
thoughts:</hi> for the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſake of which onely, I
choſe this Text, as my
ground; <hi>That</hi> is it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
which I will chiefly
inſiſt upon. A <hi>ſubject</hi>
which, I confeſſe, would
prove of all elſe the vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt.
To make an exact
particular diſcovery of
the vanities in our
thoughts, to travell over
the whole Creation, and
to take a ſurvey, and give
an account of all that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
abounds in all the
creatures, was (as you
know) the taske of the
wiſeſt of men, <hi>Solomon;</hi>
the flowre of his ſtudies
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:150618:9"/>
and labours: But the <hi>vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of our thoughts,</hi> are as
multiplied much in us;
this <hi>little world</hi> affoords
more varieties of vanities,
than the Great. Our
thoughts made the <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
ſubject to vanitie,
Rom.</hi> 8. 20. therfore them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
are ſubject to vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
much more. In hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of them I will ſhew
you, 1. What is meant by
<hi>Thoughts. 2. What</hi> by <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
3. That our thoughts
are vaine.</hi> 4. Wherein
that vanity doth conſiſt,
both in the generall, and
ſome particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, what is <hi>meant by
thoughts,</hi> eſpecially as
they are the intended ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of this diſcourſe,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:150618:9"/>
which in ſo vaſt an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
I muſt neceſſarily
ſet limits unto: 1. By
<hi>thoughts,</hi> the Scriptures do
comprehend all the <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi>
acts of the minde of
man, of what faculty
ſoever, all thoſe reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
conſultations, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes,
reſolutions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,
ends, deſires, and
cares of the minde of man,
as oppoſed to our <hi>external</hi>
words and actions, ſo <hi>Iſay</hi>
66. 18. All acts are divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into thoſe two, <hi>I know
their workes and their
thoughts:</hi> what is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
within the minde, is
called the <hi>thoughts;</hi> what
thereof do manifeſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and breake out in
actions, are called <hi>workes.</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:150618:10"/>
And ſo <hi>Geneſ. 6. 5. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
imagination of the
thoughts, (omne figmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi>)
all the creatures the
minde frames within it
ſelfe, purpoſes, deſires, &amp;c.
(as it is noted in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin)
<hi>are evill;</hi> where by
thoughts are underſtood
all that <hi>comes within the
minde,</hi> (as <hi>Ezech.</hi> 11. 5. the
phraſe is) and ſo indeed
we vulgarly uſe it, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
it, ſo <hi>To remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
a man, is, to <hi>thinke of
him, Gen.</hi> 40. 14. to have
<hi>purpoſed</hi> a thing, we ſay, <hi>I
thought to doe it.</hi> To take
<hi>care</hi> about a buſineſſe, is to
<hi>take thought, 1 Sam.</hi> 9. 5.
And the reaſon, why all
may thus bee called <hi>the
thoughts,</hi> is, becauſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:150618:10"/>
all affections, deſires,
purpoſes, are ſtirred up by
thoughts, bred, fomented,
and nouriſhed by them:
no one thought paſſeth,
but it ſtirreth ſome affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of feare, joy, care, grief,
&amp;c. No, although they
are thus <hi>largely</hi> taken
here, yet I intend not to
handle the <hi>vanity</hi> of them
in ſo large a ſenſe at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent:
I muſt confine my
ſelfe, as ſtrictly as may be,
to the vanity of that,
which is more <hi>properly</hi>
called the <hi>thinking, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating,
conſidering power of
man,</hi> which is in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
or ſpirit, that
being the ſubject I have in
hand: <hi>Thoughts</hi> not being
in this ſenſe oppoſed one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:150618:11"/>
to <hi>your workes,</hi> but unto
purpoſes and intents, ſo
<hi>Hebr.</hi> 4. 12. as the <hi>ſoule</hi>
and <hi>ſpirit,</hi> ſo thoughts and
intents ſeeme to bee oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
And <hi>Iob 20. 2, 3.
Thoughts</hi> are appropriated
to the <hi>Spirit of underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</hi>
And againe yet
more ſtrictly, for in the
underſtanding I meane not
to ſpeake of, generally, all
thoughts therein, neither,
as not of the <hi>reaſonings</hi> or
<hi>deliberations</hi> in our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
but thoſe <hi>muſings</hi>
onely in the <hi>Speculative</hi>
part.</p>
            <p>And ſo, I can no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
expreſſe them to
you, than thus. Thoſe
ſame firſt, more <hi>ſimple
conceits, apprehenſions</hi> that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:150618:11"/>
ariſe; thoſe <hi>fancies, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi>
which the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
by the <hi>helpe of
fancy frames within it ſelfe
of things;</hi> thoſe whereon
your mindes ponder and
pore, and muſe upon
things, theſe I meane by
<hi>thoughts,</hi> I meane thoſe
<hi>talkings</hi> of our mindes
with the things wee know,
as the Scripture calls it,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 22. thoſe ſame
parleys, enterviews, chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
the minde hath
with the things let into it,
with the things wee feare,
with the things wee love.
For all theſe things our
mindes make their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
and our thoughts
hold them diſcourſe, and
have a thouſand conceits
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:150618:12"/>
about them; this I meane
by <hi>thoughts.</hi> For beſides
that <hi>reaſoning</hi> power, <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berating</hi>
power, whereby
wee aske our ſelves conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually,
<hi>what ſhall wee doe?</hi>
and whereby wee reaſon
and diſcuſſe things, which
is a more inward cloſet,
the Cabinet and privie
councell of the heart,
there is a more outward
lodging, that preſence
chamber, which enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
all commers, which
is the <hi>thinking, meditating,
muſing</hi> power in man,
which ſuggeſteth matter
for deliberations, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations,
and reaſonings,
which holds the <hi>objects</hi> till
we view them, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaineth
all that come to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:150618:12"/>
ſpeake with any of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</p>
            <p>2. I adde, which <hi>the
minde frames within it ſelf,</hi>
ſo the Scripture expreſſeth
their originall to us,
and their maner of riſing,
<hi>Prov. 6. 14. Frowardneſſe
is in his heart, fabricatur,</hi>
hee <hi>forgeth miſchiefe,</hi> as a
Smith doth Iron, ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
it out: and the
thoughts are the materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls
of this frowardneſſe
in us; upon all the things
which are preſented to us,
the minde begets ſome
thoughts, imaginations on
them; and as <hi>luſts,</hi> ſo
<hi>thoughts</hi> are conceived,
<hi>Iames 1. Iſay 59. 4. They
conceive miſchiefe, and
bring forth iniquitie, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:150618:13"/>
hatch Cochatrice egges, and
weave Spiders webbes.</hi> And
<hi>verſe</hi> 7. hee inſtanceth in
<hi>thoughts of iniquity,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
our thoughts are
ſpunne out of our owne
hearts, are egges of our
owne laying, though the
things preſented to us bee
from without.</p>
            <p>And this I adde to ſever
them from ſuch <hi>thoughts</hi>
as are <hi>injected,</hi> and caſt in,
onely from without<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which are children of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others
begetting, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
laid out of doores:
ſuch as are blaſphemous
thoughts caſt in <hi>by Satan,</hi>
wherein if the ſoule bee
meerely paſſive, (as the
word <hi>Buffeting</hi> implies,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7.) they are none
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:150618:13"/>
of your thoughts, but his;
wherein a man is but as
one in a roome with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
where he heares ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſweare and curſe, but
cannot get out from him;
ſuch thoughts, if they bee
onely <hi>from without,</hi> defile
not a man. For <hi>nothing
defiles a man, but what
comes from within, Matth.</hi>
15. 18, 19. or which the
heart hath begotten upon
it by the devil, as thoughts
of uncleannes, &amp;c. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
though he be the father,
yet the heart is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and wombe; and
therfore accordingly they
affect the heart, as naturall
children doe, and by that
wee may diſtinguiſh them
from the other, namely,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:150618:14"/>
when we have a ſoft heart,
an inward love unto them,
ſo that our hearts doe kiſſe
the childe, then they are
our <hi>thoughts,</hi> or elſe when
the heart broods upon
theſe egges, then they are
our <hi>thoughts,</hi> though they
come from without.</p>
            <p>Though this is to bee
added, that even thoſe
thoughts, wherein the
ſoule is paſſive, and which
Satan caſts in, which wee
do no wayes owne, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
hee <hi>raviſheth</hi> the heart,
rather than <hi>begets</hi> them
on us, (if there bee not any
conſent to them in us,
then it is but a <hi>Rape,</hi> as in
law it is not) I yeeld
thoſe thoughts are puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
often of neglect of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:150618:14"/>
our thoughts, and of our
ſuffering them to wander;
as <hi>Dinah,</hi> becauſe ſhe went
cunningly out, <hi>to view the
Daughters of the land,</hi> was
taken and raviſh't, though
againſt her will: yet it was
a puniſhment of her curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity:
or elſe they are the
puniſhment of the neglect
of good motions of the
ſpirit; which reſiſting, <hi>we
thereby grieve him,</hi> and ſo
he deales with us, as wee
with our children, ſuffers
us to bee ſcared with bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beares,
and to bee grieved
by <hi>Satan,</hi> that wee may
learne what it is to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
him, and harbour
vanity. Laſtly, I adde,
which the minde, <hi>in and by
it ſelfe,</hi> or by the helpe of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:150618:15"/>
fancy, thus begets and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaines,
becauſe there
are no thoughts or like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
of things at any
time in our fancies, but at
the ſame time they are in
the underſtanding alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
unto it: As when
two Looking-glaſſes are
placed oppoſite and nigh
each to other, looke what
ſpecies appeares in the
one, doe alſo in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Secondly, let us ſee
what <hi>vanity</hi> is, take it in
all the acceptations of it;
It is true of our <hi>thoughts</hi>
that they are <hi>vaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. It is taken for <hi>unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitableneſs.</hi>
So <hi>Eccleſ. 1. 2, 3.
All is vanitie,</hi> becauſe
there is no profit <hi>in them
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:150618:15"/>
under the Sunne,</hi> ſuch are
our thoughts by nature,
the wiſeſt of them will
not ſtand us in any
ſtead in time of need,
in time of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
diſtreſſe of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
day of death or
Judgement, 1 <hi>Corin. 2. 6.
All the wiſedome of</hi> the
wiſe comes to <hi>nought, Pro.
10. 20. The heart of the
wicked is little worth,</hi> not
a penny for them all,
whereas the thoughts of a
godly man are his <hi>trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure:
Out of the good trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of his heart, hee brings
them forth.</hi> He mints them,
and they are laid up as his
riches. <hi>Pſal. 138. 17. How
pretious are they?</hi> he there
ſpeakes of our <hi>thoughts of

<hi>Prov. 24. 9. The

therefore prove this to

<hi>Thoughts are ſinnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The <hi>Law judgeth</hi>

            <p>

truely and throughly
wrought on, (as 2 <hi>Cor. 10.

which argues that they
are naturally rebellious,
and contrary to grace.
And this alſo argueth the
<hi>Power of grace,</hi> which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to <hi>rule</hi> and to ſubdue
ſo great an Army as our

            <p>4. They defile the man:
<hi>which nothing defiles but
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:150618:18"/>
ſinne,</hi> Matt. 15. 15, 16, 17.
Out of the heart proceed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
thoughts, theſe defile
the man.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>They are an</hi> abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to the Lord, <hi>who
hates nothing but ſinne,
and</hi> whoſe pure eyes can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure

Prov. 15. 16. <hi>as good</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations

Pſal. 25. ult. <hi>ſo by the rule

            <p>6. They <hi>hinder</hi> all <hi>good</hi>
wee ſhould doe, and ſpoile
our beſt performances.
Vaine thoughts draw the
heart away in them, that
when a man ſhould draw
nigh to God, his <hi>Heart,</hi> by
reaſon of his thoughts, <hi>is
farre off from him, Eſay
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:150618:19"/>
29. 16. A mans heart goes
after his covetouſneſſe,</hi>
when hee ſhould <hi>heare,</hi> as
the Prophet ſpeakes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
his thoughts thus
run. Now nothing elſe
but ſinne could ſeparate,
and what doth eſtrange us
from God, is ſinne, and
enmity to him.</p>
            <p>7. Our thoughts are the
<hi>firſt motioners of all the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
in us.</hi> For they make
the motion, and alſo bring
the heart and object toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
are panders to our
luſts, hold up the object,
till the heart hath plaid
the adulterer with it, and
committed folly, ſo in
ſpeculative uncleanneſs, &amp;
in other luſts, they hold
up the images of thoſe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:150618:19"/>
gods they create, which
the heart falls downe and
worſhips; they preſent
credit, riches, beauty, till
the heart hath worſhipt
them, and this when the
things themſelves are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p>To come now to thoſe
<hi>Particulars</hi> wherein this
<hi>vanity</hi> of the <hi>thinking,</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating
power of the
minde conſiſts.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I will diſcover it in
regard of <hi>thinking what is
good,</hi> how unable and loth,
&amp;c. it is to good thoughts;
and ſecondly, in regard of
the readineſſe <hi>of it to think
of evill and vaine things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the firſt, firſt in <hi>a
want of ability</hi> ordinarily,
and naturally to raiſe and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:150618:20"/>
extract holy and uſefull
conſiderations &amp; thoughts
from all ordinary occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencies,
and occaſions;
which the minde, ſo farre
as it is ſanctified, is apt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
A heart ſanctified, and
in whoſe affections true
grace is enkindled, out of
all Gods dealings with
him, out of the things he
ſees and heares, out of all
the objects are put into the
thoughts he diſtilleth ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and ſweet, and uſefull
meditations: and it natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
doth it, and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
doth it, ſo farre as it is
ſanctified. So our Saviour
Chriſt, all ſpeeches of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
which hee heard, all
accidents and occurrences
did ſtill raiſe and occaſion
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:150618:20"/>
in him heavenly medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
as wee may ſee
throughout the whole
Goſpels: when he came by
a well, hee ſpeakes of the
<hi>Water of life, Iohn</hi> 4, &amp;c.
Many inſtances might bee
given; <hi>He</hi> in his thoughts
tranſlated the book of the
creatures, into the booke
of grace, and ſo did <hi>Adams</hi>
heart in innocency: his
<hi>Philoſophy</hi> might be truely
termed <hi>Divinity,</hi> becauſe
hee ſaw God in all; all rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
up his heart to thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
and praiſe: So now
in like manner our mindes,
ſo farre as they are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
will doe. As the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers-ſtone</hi>
turnes all
Metals into Gold; As
the Bee ſucks honey out
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:150618:21"/>
of every flower, and a
good ſtomack ſucks out
ſome ſweet and wholſome
nouriſhment out of what
it takes unto it ſelfe: ſo
doth a holy heart, ſo farre
as ſanctified, convert and
digeſt all into ſpiritual uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
thoughts; this you
may ſee, <hi>Pſalme 107. ult.
That Pſalme</hi> gives many
inſtances of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
<hi>and wonderfull
works which hee doth for the
ſonnes of men;</hi> as delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
by Sea, where men
ſee his wonders: delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
to Captives, &amp;c.
and ſtill the foot of the
Song is, <hi>Oh that men
would therefore praiſe the
Lord for the wonderfull
workes hee doth for the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:150618:21"/>
ſonnes of men.</hi> Now after al
theſe inſtances, hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,
that though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
paſſe over ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences
with ordinarie
ſlight thoughts, yet
ſayes hee, <hi>The righteous
ſhall ſee it, and rejoyce:</hi> that
is, extract comfortable
thoughts out of all, which
ſhall be matter of joy, and
<hi>who ſo is wiſe will obſerve
thoſe things,</hi> that is, makes
holy obſervations out of
all theſe, and out of a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of wiſedome hee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands
Gods goodneſs
in all, and ſo his heart is
raiſed to thoughts of
praiſe, and thankfulneſſe,
and obedience. Now
compare with this the 92.
<hi>Pſalme</hi> made for <hi>the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:150618:22"/>
(when in imitation of
God, who that day view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his works, wee are, on
our <hi>Lords day,</hi> ſtill to raiſe
holy praiſefull thoughts
out of them to his glory,
which hee that penned
that <hi>Pſalme</hi> then did, <hi>verſ.</hi>
1. and 2. and) <hi>ver. 5. How
great are thy workes, &amp;c!
A brutiſh man knowes not,
nor will a foole underſtand
this:</hi> that is, hee being a
beaſt, and having no ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
principle of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
in him, lookes no
further than a beaſt into
all the works of God, and
occurrences of things;
lookes on all bleſſings as
things provided for mans
delight by God: but hee
extracts ſeldome holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:150618:22"/>
and uſefull thoughts
out of all, he wants the art
of doing it.</p>
            <p>If injuries be offered us
by others, what doe our
thoughts diſtill out of
thoſe wrongs, but
thoughts of revenge? we
meditate how to requite it
againe. But ſee how na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
<hi>Davids</hi> mind di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtills
other thoughts of
<hi>Shemeis</hi> curſing, 2 <hi>Sam.
16. 11. God hath bidden
him,</hi> and it may prove a
good ſigne of Gods favor.
<hi>God may requite good for it.</hi>
When we ſee judgements
befall others, ſevere
thoughts of cenſure our
mindes are apt to raiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
our brother, as <hi>Iobs</hi>
friends did. But a godly
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:150618:23"/>
man whoſe minde is much
ſanctified, raiſeth other
thoughts out of it, <hi>Prov.
21. 22. Wiſely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So when outward mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
befall us, the next
thoughts wee are apt to
have, is to project eaſe by
our wealth, thou <hi>haſt goods
for many yeares:</hi> and when
judgements befall us, wee
are apt to be fill'd with
thoughts of complaint,
and feares, and cares how
to winde out againe. But
what were the firſt
thoughts <hi>Iob</hi> had, upon
the newes of the loſſe of
all? <hi>God hath given, and
the Lord hath taken, bleſſed
be the Lord for all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such thoughts as theſe
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:150618:23"/>
(which all opportunities
hint unto) a good heart is
apprehenſive of, and doth
naturally raiſe for its owne
uſe. So farre <hi>Barren as
our thoughts are, ſo farre
vaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the <hi>vanitie,</hi>
and ſinfulneſſe of the
minde appeares in a <hi>loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi>
to <hi>entertaine holy
thoughts,</hi> to begin to ſet it
ſelfe to thinke of God,
and the things belonging
unto our peace; even as
loath they are to this as
Schoole-boyes are to goe
to their Books, or to buſie
their mindes about their
leſſons, their heads being
full of play; ſo loath are
our mindes to enter into
ſerious conſiderations, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:150618:24"/>
to ſad ſolemne thoughts
of God, or death, &amp;c.
Men are as loath to thinke
of <hi>death,</hi> as theeves of the
<hi>execution;</hi> or to thinke of
<hi>God,</hi> as they are of their
Judge. So to goe over
their owne actions, in a
review of them, and read
the blurd writing of their
hearts, and to <hi>commune
with them,</hi> at night in the
end of the day, (as <hi>David</hi>
did, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 119. 59.) men
are as loath to doe this, as
Schoole-boyes are to
perſe their leſſons, and the
falſe Latins they have
made, <hi>Iob 21. Depart
from us</hi> (ſay they in <hi>Iob</hi>)
unto God, from their
thoughts they meant it,
for it follows, <hi>we deſire not
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:150618:24"/>
the knowledge of thy wayes.</hi>
They would not thinke of
him, or know them by
their good wills; and
therefore our mindes, like
a bad ſtomack, are nauſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the very ſcent of
good things, and ſoone
caſts them up againe,
<hi>Rom. 1. 28. They like not
to retaine the knowledge of
God:</hi> let us goe and try to
wind up our ſoules, at any
time, to holy meditations,
to thinke of what we have
heard, or what wee have
done, or what is our duty
to doe, and wee ſhall finde
our minds, like the peggs
of an Inſtrument, ſlip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
our fingers, as we
are a winding them up, and
to fall downe ſuddenly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:150618:25"/>
ere we are aware of
it: yea you ſhall finde, that
your mindes will labour
to ſhun what may occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſuch thoughts; even as
men goe out of the way,
when they ſee they muſt
meet with one they are
loath to ſpeake withall;
yea men dare not be alone,
for feare ſuch thoughts
ſhould returne upon them.
The beſt ſhall finde a glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
for an excuſe, by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
occaſions to knocke
off their thoughts from
what is good: whereas in
thinking of vaine earthly
things, we thinke the time
paſſeth too faſt, clocks
ſtrike too ſoone, houres
paſſe away ere wee are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:150618:25"/>
Thirdly, the <hi>vanity</hi> and
ſinfulneſſe of the minde
appeares in the godly,
that though they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
good thoughts, yet
the minde is not, will not
bee <hi>long intent</hi> on them.
Some things there are,
which wee are, and can be
intent upon, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
dwell long upon
them, and therefore in
<hi>Iob 17. 11. The thoughts</hi>
are called the <hi>poſſeſsions of
the heart,</hi> (ſo 'tis in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall,
and noted in the
margin) ſuch thoughts as
are pleaſing, the heart
dwells on them; yea ſo
intent are wee often, that
they hinder our ſleepe: as
'tis ſaid of wicked men,
<hi>They cannot ſleepe for mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:150618:26"/>
of thoughts, Eccleſ.
5. 12. So, to deviſe froward
things, Solomon</hi> ſayes,
<hi>Prov. 16. 30. That a man
ſhuts his eyes,</hi> that is, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
attentive, poreth
upon his plots; for ſo a
man doth uſe to do, to ſhut
his eyes when hee would
be intent, and therefore it
is ſo expreſſed. But now
let the minde be occupied
and buſied about good
things, and things belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to our peace, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteady
is it? which things
ſhould yet draw out the
intention of the minde:
For the more excellent
the object is, the ſtronger
our intention ſhould bee.
God is the moſt glorious
object our mindes can fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:150618:26"/>
on, the moſt alluring.
The thought of whom
therefore ſhould ſwallow
up all other, as not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to bee ſeene the ſame
day with him: But I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale
to all your experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
if your thoughts of
him be not moſt unſteady,
and are, (that I may ſo
compare it) as when wee
looke upon a Starre tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
an Optique glaſſe,
held with a palſie ſhaking
hand: It is long ere wee
can bring our mindes to
have ken of him, to place
our eyes upon him, and
when wee have, how doe
our hands ſhake, and ſo
looſe ſight ever and anon?
So whilſt wee are in never
ſo ſerious talke with him,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:150618:27"/>
when all things elſe ſhould
ſtand without, and not
dare to offer entrance, till
wee have done with him,
yet how many chinkes are
there in the heart, at which
other thoughts come in?
and our minds leave God,
and follow them, and <hi>goe
after our covetouſneſſe,</hi> our
credit, &amp;c. as the Prophets
phraſe is, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 33. So
when wee are hearing the
Word, how do our minds
ever and anon runne out of
the Church, and come <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
againe, and ſo doe not
heare halfe that is ſaid?
So when wee are at
our callings, which God
bids us to bee converſant
about with all our might,
<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9. 10. yet our minds
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:150618:27"/>
like idle truants, or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
ſervants, though
ſent about never ſo ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
a buſineſſe, yet goe out
of the way to ſee any
ſport, runne after the Hares
that croſſe the way, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
after Butter-flies that
buzze about us.</p>
            <p>And ſo when wee come
to pray, Chriſt bids <hi>watch
to prayer, Mark.</hi> 13. 33. that
is, as if wee were at every
dore to place a guard that
none come in and diſturbe
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> knock us off. But how
oft doth the heart nod, and
fall aſleepe, and runne into
another world, as men in
dreames doe? Yea ſo
naturall are diſtractions to
us, when wee are buſied
about holy duties, that as
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:150618:28"/>
excrements come from
men, when very weak and
ſicke, ere they are aware
of it; ſo doe worldly
thoughts from us, and we
are carried out of that
ſtreame of good our mind
was running in, into ſome
by creek ere we are aware
of it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the <hi>vanity</hi> of
the minde appeares, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of <hi>good</hi> things, that
if it doth thinke of them,
yet it doth it <hi>unſeaſonably.</hi>
It is with your thoughts
as with your ſpeeches,
their goodneſs lies in their
placing and order, <hi>Prov.
25. 11. If fitly ſpoken,</hi> they
are <hi>as Apples of Gold in pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
of ſilver.</hi> And as
a man is to bring forth
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:150618:28"/>
actions, ſo thoughts in <hi>due
ſeaſon;</hi> as thoſe <hi>fruits,</hi> ſo
theſe <hi>buds</hi> ſhould come
out in <hi>ſeaſon, Pſalm.</hi> 1. Now
the vanity of the minde
appears in thinking of
ſome good things, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
unſeaſonably; when
you are praying, you
ſhould not onely have no
worldly thoughts come in,
but no other than pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thoughts. But then
haply ſome notions of, or
for a Sermon will come
readily in: ſo in hearing, a
man ſhall often have good
thoughts that are hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneall
to the thing in
hand; So when a man is
falling downe to prayer,
looke what thing a man
had forgotten, when it
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:150618:29"/>
ſhould have beene thought
of, will then come in, or
what will affect a man
much comes in to divert
him. This <hi>miſplacing</hi> of
<hi>thoughts</hi> (ſuppoſe they bee
good) is yet from a vanity
of the minde; did thoſe
thoughts come at another
time, they ſhould be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come:
we finde our minds
ready to ſpend thoughts
about any thing, rather
than what God at preſent
calls unto. When we goe
to a Sermon, we finde we
could then ſpend our
thoughts more willingly
about reading; or happily
ſearching our hearts; unto
which at another time,
when called to it, wee
ſhould be moſt unwilling
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:150618:29"/>
to. We could bee content
to run wild over the fields
of meditations and miſcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanious
thoughts, though
about good, rather than
to bee tied to that taske,
and kept in one ſet path.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Adam</hi> and Chriſt
no thought was miſpla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
but though they were
as <hi>many</hi> as the <hi>Starres,</hi> yet
they marched in their
<hi>courſes,</hi> and kept their
ranks. But ours as Mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors,
dance up and dowve
in us. And this <hi>diſorder</hi> is
a <hi>vanity</hi> and <hi>ſinne,</hi> bee the
thought materially never
ſo good. Not every one
that hath the beſt part
muſt therefore firſt ſtep
up the Stage to Act, but
take his right cue. In
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:150618:30"/>
Printing, let the letters bee

upon no termes ſhould
breake their ranks: ſo nor

16. 3. There is a promiſe
to a <hi>Righteous man, that</hi>
(as ſome reade it) <hi>his

            </p>
            <p>And ſo much for the
firſt part, <hi>The privative</hi>
ſinfulneſſe in our <hi>thoughts,</hi>
in reſpect of <hi>what is good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now ſecondly, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to diſcover that <hi>poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
vanity,</hi> which appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
in our thoughts; in
regard <hi>of what is evill.</hi>
And here it is not to bee
expected, nor indeed can
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:150618:30"/>
it bee performed by any
man, to reckon up the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
particularities of
all thoſe vaine thoughts
which run through mans
heart; I will inſiſt onely
on ſome more generall
diſcoveries, to which par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
may be reduced,
for a taſte of the reſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the <hi>vanitie</hi> of
them diſcovers it ſelfe, in
that which Chriſt calls,
<hi>Mark.</hi> 7. 22. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi>
that is, ſuch thoughts
as mad men have, and
fooles; which <hi>fooliſhneſſe</hi>
is ſeene, both in that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetled
wantonneſſe and
<hi>unſtayedneſſe</hi> of the minde
in thinking, that like
quick-ſilver it cannot fixe,
but as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſayes, <hi>Prov.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:150618:31"/>
17. 24. A fooles eyes are
in the ends of the earth,</hi> are
gariſh, and runne up and
downe from one end of
the earth to the other,
ſhooting and ſtreaming, as
thoſe Meteors you ſee
ſometimes in the ayre.
And though indeed the
minde of man is nimble
and able thus to run from
one end of the earth to
another, (which is its
ſtrength and excellency)
yet God would not have
this ſtrength and nimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and metall-ſpirit in
curvetting and tumbling,
(as I may call it) but in
ſteady directing all our
thoughts ſtraight on to his
glory, our owne ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the good of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:150618:31"/>
he gave it this nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe
to turne away
from evill, and the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of it. As we are
to walke in Gods wayes
hee calls us to, ſo every
thought, as well as every
action is a ſtep: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ought to bee ſteady,
<hi>Make ſtraight ſteps to your
feete,</hi> ſayes the Apoſtle,
<hi>Hebrews</hi> 12. 13. turning
not to the right hand, nor
to the left, untill we come
to the journeys end of
that buſineſſe wee are to
think of. But our thoughts,
at beſt, are as wanton Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niels,
who though indeed
they goe with, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
their Maſter, and
come to their journeys
end with him in the end,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:150618:32"/>
yet doe runne after every
Bird, and wildly purſue
every ſlock of ſheepe they
ſee. This unſteadineſſe, it
ariſeth from the like curſe
on the minde of <hi>Man,</hi> as
was on <hi>Caine,</hi> that it being
<hi>driven from the preſence of
the Lord,</hi> it proves a vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond,
<hi>and ſo mens eyes are
in the ends of the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This fooliſhneſſe or
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is alſo ſeene in
that <hi>Independence</hi> in our
thoughts; they hanging
oft together as ropes of
ſand; this wee ſee more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently
in dreames: And
not onely then, but when
awake alſo, and <hi>that,</hi> when
we would ſet our ſelves to
be moſt ſerious, how doe
our thoughts jangle and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:150618:32"/>
ring back-ward? and as
wanton Boyes, when they
take pens in their hands,
ſcribble broken words
that have no dependence.
Thus doe our thoughts:
and if you would but
looke over the copies
thereof, which you write
continually, you would
finde as much non-ſenſe in
your thoughts, as you find
in mad mens ſpeeches.
This madneſſe and diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
is in the minde ſince
the fall (though it appeares
not in our words, becauſe
wee are wiſer) that if
notes were taken of our
thoughts, we ſhould finde
thoughts ſo vagrant, that
wee know not how they
come in, nor whence they
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:150618:33"/>
came, nor whither they
would. But as <hi>God</hi> doth
<hi>all things</hi> in <hi>weight, num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
and <hi>meaſure,</hi> ſo doth
his Image in us, ſo farre as
it is renewed. And, by
reaſon of theſe two, the
<hi>folly, unſetledneſſe,</hi> and
<hi>independence</hi> of our
thoughts, wee bring our
thoughts often to no iſſue,
to no perfection, but wilder
away our time <hi>in
thinking</hi> (as you uſe to
ſay) <hi>of nothing,</hi> and as <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi>
ſayes of mens <hi>lives,</hi>
as of Ships that are toſt up
and downe at Sea, it may
bee ſaid they have beene
<hi>toſſed much,</hi> but <hi>ſayled</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
The like in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
may bee ſaid of the
thoughts: Or as when
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:150618:33"/>
men make imperfect daſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
and write non-ſenſe,
<hi>They are ſaid to ſcribble,
they doe not write:</hi> So, in
theſe follies and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies,
wee wilder and
<hi>loſe our ſelves, wee doe not
thinke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But 2. on the contrary
if any <hi>ſtrong luſt,</hi> or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
paſſion be up, then our
thoughts are <hi>too fixed</hi> and
<hi>intent,</hi> and run in ſo farre
into ſuch ſinfull objects,
that they cannot bee puld
out againe, or any way di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
or taken off: which
is another vanity. For
our thoughts and our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
part was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
to moderate, allay,
and coole, and take off our
paſſions, when they are a
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:150618:34"/>
playing over, to rule and
governe them. But now
our thoughts are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſubjected to our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
and like fuell put
under them, doe but make
them boile the more. And
although our thoughts do
firſt ſtirre up our feares,
joyes, deſires, &amp;c. yet
theſe being ſtirred up
once, chaine, and fixe, and
hold our thoughts to
thoſe objects, ſo as wee
cannot looſen them again.
Therefore ſayes Chriſt to
his Diſciples, <hi>Why are you
troubled, and why doe
thoughts ariſe in your
hearts:</hi> For perturbations
in the affections cauſe
thoughts like fumes and
vapours to aſcend. Thus
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:150618:34"/>
if a <hi>paſsion of feare</hi> bee up,
how doth it conjure up
multitudes of ghoſtly
thoughts which wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
conjure downe againe,
nor hide our eyes from?
But which haunt us, and
follow us up and downe,
where ever wee goe, ſo as
a man runnes away purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by his owne thoughts,
<hi>the heart then meditates on
terrour:</hi> As <hi>Iſay</hi> 33. 18. So
when ſorrow is up, how
doth it make us ſtudy the
croſſe that lights upon us?
which to forget, would
be an eaſe unto the minde.
But a mans paſſions makes
his thoughts to con it, and
to ſay it by heart, over
and over againe, as if it
would not have us forget
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:150618:35"/>
it. So when <hi>love</hi> and <hi>deſire</hi>
is up, bee the thing what it
will, wee are taken with, as
preferment, credit, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
riches, it ſets our
thoughts aworke to view
the thing all over, from
top to toe (as wee ſay) to
obſerve every part and
circumſtance, that doth
make it amiable unto us:
as if a picture were to bee
drawn of it. So when <hi>joy</hi>
is up, wee view the thing
we rejoice in, and reade it
over and over, as wee doe
a Booke wee like, and wee
marke every tittle, wee are
punctuall in it; yea ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
are wee herein, as
often we cannot ſleepe for
thinking on them. <hi>Eccleſ.
5. 12. Abundance of riches
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:150618:35"/>
will not ſuffer him to
ſleepe, for the multitude of
thoughts in his head,</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of a man who is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous:
how doe thoughts
trouble the <hi>Belſhazzers</hi>
and <hi>Nebuchadonezers</hi> of
the world? <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 19.
ſo <hi>Proverbs 4. 16. They
ſleepe not unleſſe they have
done miſchiefe;</hi> if their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
remaine unſatisfied,
they doe diſturbe their
thoughts, like froward
children by their crying:
ſo as, often, <hi>theſe</hi> which
men count <hi>free</hi> (as the
moſt doe <hi>thoughts</hi>) doe
prove the greateſt bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
and torment in the
earth unto them, and doe
hinder ſleepe, the nurſe of
nature, eate out, and live
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:150618:36"/>
upon the heart that bred
them, weary the ſpirits,
that when a man <hi>ſhall ſay</hi>
(as <hi>Iob 7. 13.) My bed
ſhall comfort mee,</hi> by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a parentheſis to
his thoughts, and ſad
diſcourſes, which hee hath
when awake, yet then
they haunt a man; and as
<hi>verſ. 14. terrifie him.</hi> A
man cannot lay them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
as he doth his cloake:
and when men die they
will follow them to hell,
and torment them worſe
there; your thoughts are
one of the greateſt execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners
there, even the
<hi>worme that dies not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, the <hi>vanity</hi> of
the minde appeares in <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity,</hi>
a longing and itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:150618:36"/>
to bee fed with, and to
know (and then delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to thinke of) things
that do not at all concerne
us. Take an experiment
of this in Schollers (whoſe
chiefe worke lies in this
ſhop) how many precious
thoughts are ſpent this
way? as in curioſity of
knowledge, as appeares
by thoſe the Apoſtle of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
rebukes, that affect, as
1 <hi>Tim. 6. 4, 20. oppoſitions
of ſcience falſely ſo called</hi>
curioſities of knowledge
<hi>of things they have not
ſeene.</hi> So <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2. and
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 7. hee calls ſuch
iſſues of mens braines,
they dote on, <hi>old wives fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles:</hi>
becauſe as fables
pleaſe old wives, ſo doe
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:150618:37"/>
theſe their mindes, and of
that itch they have in
them, even as women
with child, in their long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
content not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with what the place
affords, or the ſeaſon, with
what may he had; but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
long after ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
of rarity, far fetcht,
or, it may bee, not at all to
bee had: Thus men not
contenting themſelves
with the wonders of God
diſcovered in the depth of
his Word and Workes,
they will launch into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Sea, and world of
their owne making, and
there they ſaile with
pleaſure, as many of the
Schoole-men did in ſome
of their ſpeculations,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:150618:37"/>
ſpending their pretious
wits in framing curious
webs out of their owne
bowels.</p>
            <p>Take another inſtance
alſo in others, who have
leiſure and parts to reade
much, they ſhould ballaſt
their hearts with the
Word, and take in thoſe
more pretious words of
wiſdome and ſound know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to profit themſelves
and others, and to build
up their owne ſoules, and
whereby they may bee
enabled to ſerve their
Countrey: but now what
doe their curious fancies
carry them unto, to bee
verſed in, but Play-books,
jearing Paſquils, Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
fained ſtayes, which
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:150618:38"/>
are the curious needle-worke
of idle braines, ſo
as they load their heads
with <hi>Apes and Peacocks
feathers,</hi> in ſtead of pearles
and pretious ſtones; ſo as
a man may ſay as <hi>Solomon
Prov. 15. 14. The heart of
him that hath underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſeeketh knowledge, but
the mouth of fooles feeds on
fooliſhneſſe.</hi> Fooliſh diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
pleaſe their eares
and eyes to reade: all theſe
being but purveiors (as it
were) for food, for the
thoughts, like Camelions
men live on ayre and
winde.</p>
            <p>To leave them, how
doe others out of meere
curioſity to know and
pleaſe their thoughts, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:150618:38"/>
after all the news that
flies up and downe the
world, ſcum all the froth
that floats in fooliſh mens
mouths, and pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
onely with talking,
thinking, and hearing
of it.</p>
            <p>I doe not condemne all
herein: ſome their ends
are good, and they can
make uſe of it, and doe as
<hi>Nehemiah</hi> did, who inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
how things went at
<hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> to rejoyce with
Gods people, and mourne
with them, and pray for
them, and to know how
to faſhion their prayers
accordingly. But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
that curious itch
that is in men, when it is
done, but meerly to pleaſe
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:150618:39"/>
their fancies, which is
much delighted with new
things, though they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
us not; ſuch the
<hi>Athenians</hi> were, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.
21. How doe ſome men
long all the weeke, till
they heare events and
iſſues, and make it a great
part of the happineſſe of
their lives, to ſtudy the
ſtate more than their own
hearts, and affaires of their
callings: who take actions
of State as their text to
ſtudy the meaning of, and
to preach on where-ever
they come. I ſpeake of
thoſe that yet lay not to
heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the miſeries of
the Church of Chriſt,
nor helpe them with
their prayers, if at any
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:150618:39"/>
time they happen.</p>
            <p>The like curioſity is
ſeene in many, in deſiring
to know the ſecrets of
other men, which yet
would doe them no good
to know, and who doe ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
mens actions and ends,
not to reforme, or doe
good to them, but to
know them, and think and
muſe thereof, when alone,
with pleaſure; this is curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity,
and properly a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the thinking pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
which it mainely plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth;
and is indeed a great
ſin, when much of mens
moſt pleaſing thoughts
are ſpent on things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
them not. For the
things we ought to know,
and which doe concerne
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:150618:40"/>
us, are enough to take up
all our thoughts alone,
neither ſhall wee have any
to ſpare: and thoughts
are pretious things, the
immediate fruits and
buds of an immortall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and God hath given
us power to coyne them,
to lay them out in things
concerne our owne good,
and of our neighbours,
and his owne glory; and
thus not to ſpend them is
the greateſt waſte in the
world; examine what
Corne you put in to grind,
for God ought to have
toll of all. <hi>Prover. 24. 8.
Hee that deviſeth evill ſhall
be called a miſchievous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
not alwayes hee that
doth a miſchievous action,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:150618:40"/>
but that deviſeth it:
and <hi>verſe</hi> 9. he aggravates
it, <hi>à minori, for every
thought is ſinne,</hi> then a
combination and conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
of wicked thoughts is
much more.</p>
            <p>But 4. there is a worſe
<hi>vanity</hi> than this, and that
is that intimated <hi>Rom. 13.
ult. Taking thought to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill
the luſts of the fleſh,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>[To make
projects for it.]</hi> For
thoughts are the Caterers
for our luſts, and lay in all
their proviſion, they are
they that looke out where
the beſt markets are, the
beſt opportunities for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in any kind, the beſt
bargaines for credit, for
preferment; for riches, &amp;c.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:150618:41"/>
For example, would a
man riſe? his thoughts ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
the art of it, men frame
their owne ladder to
climbe withall, invent
wayes how to doe it,
though often it proves as
to <hi>Haman</hi> their owne Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.
Would they bee
rich? what doe they ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy?
even all cheats and
tricks on the Cards, (as I
may ſo ſpeake) that is, all
the cunning tricks of the
world, all the wayes of
oppreſſing, defrauding,
and going beyond their
brethren, ſo to pack things
in all their dealings, that
they themſelves ſhall bee
the winners, and thoſe
that deale with them, the
loſers, <hi>Iſay</hi> 32. 7. It is
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:150618:41"/>
ſaid, <hi>that the Inſtruments of
the churliſh are evill, and
hee deviſeth wicked devices
to deſtroy the poore:</hi> would
a man undermine his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite,
as one that ſtands
in his light, and who hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his credit? he'll digge
and fall a pioning, with his
thoughts, his engins, in the
night, digge a pit, as the
<hi>Scripture phraſe is,</hi> and dig
deepe to hide his counſell,
to blow him up in the end,
and ſo as hee ſhall not
know who hurt him; and
this is worſe than all the
former, this ſtudied artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
villanie. The more
deviſing there is in ſinne,
the worſe: therefore the
fact about <hi>Vriah,</hi> not ſo
much that of <hi>Bathſheba,</hi>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:150618:42"/>
is objected againſt <hi>David,</hi>
becauſe hee uſed art in it;
hee <hi>tooke thought for
it,</hi> but in the matter of
<hi>Bathſheba, thoughts tooke
him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fiftly, the fifth is the
<hi>repreſenting</hi> or acting <hi>over
ſinnes,</hi> in our thoughts
and imaginations, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonating
thoſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures

which at preſent wee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
not really, faining and
imagining our ſelves to
act thoſe ſinfull practiſes
wee have not opportunity
outwardly to performe:
<hi>ſpeculative wickedneſſe</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
doe call it, which to
be in the power of imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to doe; is evident
to you by your dreames;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:150618:42"/>
when fancy playes its part
moſt, and to allude to
what the Prophet ſayes,
makes us beleeve <hi>wee eate

meane not to ſpeake of the

there are then (to borrow
the Apoſtles expreſſion)
<hi>filthy dreames,</hi> Jude 8.
<hi>that defile the fleſh,</hi> even
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:150618:43"/>
when awake: when, their
luſts wanting worke, their
fancie erects to them a
ſtage, and they ſet their
imaginations and thoughts
a worke to entertaine their
filthy and impure deſires,
with ſhewes and playes of
their owne making, and ſo
<hi>reaſon</hi> and the intention of
their mindes, ſit as ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
all the while to view
with pleaſure, till their
thoughts inwardly act o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their owne uncleane
deſires, ambitious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
or what ever elſe
they have a minde unto.</p>
            <p>So <hi>vaine</hi> and empty is
the heart of man become,
ſo <hi>impatient</hi> are our deſires
and luſts of interruption
in their pleaſures, ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:150618:43"/>
and corrupt.</p>
            <p>Firſt, vaine and empty
it appeares to bee in this;
for take all the pleaſures
of ſinne, when they are
never ſo fully, ſolidly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
and ſubſtantially en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed,
they are but ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
a meere outſide and
figure, as the Apoſtle cals
the world. It is opinion
of imagination that caſts
that varniſh of goodneſſe
on them, which is not tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in them. So <hi>Felix</hi> and
<hi>Bernices</hi> pompe is te<gap reason="illegible" extent="2+ letters">
                  <desc>••…</desc>
               </gap>ed
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; but now this
ſpeculative enjoying of
them onely in imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
(which many mens
hearts take ſo much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
in,) the pleaſing our
ſelves in the bare
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:150618:44"/>
thoughts and imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of them, this is but a
ſhadow of theſe ſhadows,
that the ſoul ſhould <hi>Ixion</hi>-like
embrace and commit
adultery with clouds one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
this is a <hi>vanitie</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all other vanities,
that maketh us vainer than
other creatures, who,
though <hi>ſubject to vanity,</hi>
yet not to ſuch as this.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it argues our
deſires to be impatient, to
bee detained from, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
of their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.
When the ſoule
ſhall bee found ſo greedy,
that when the heart is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred
or ſequeſtred from
thoſe things it deſires, and
wants meanes or opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
to act its luſts, as not
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:150618:44"/>
being to ſtay, it will at
leaſt enjoy them in imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and in the <hi>interim,</hi>
ſet fancie to entertaine the
minde with empty pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
of them drawne in
its owne thoughts.</p>
            <p>3. Thus they appear
alſo to bee exceeding ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and corrupt; an <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
act of ſinne, it is but
as an act of <hi>whoredome</hi>
with the creature, when
<hi>really</hi> enjoyed: But this is
<hi>Inceſt,</hi> when we defile our
ſoules and ſpirits with
theſe imaginations and
likeneſſes which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
in our own fancies,
being the children of our
owne hearts.</p>
            <p>And yet (my brethren)
ſuch ſpeculative enjoying
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:150618:45"/>
of pleaſures, and acting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of ſinnes the minde of
man is full of, as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
in many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, looke what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
men have <hi>at preſent</hi>
in their poſſeſſion, and at
command, what <hi>excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>
or endowments, men
love to be alone to ſtudy,
and thinke of them, and
when they are ſequeſtred
from the preſent uſe of
them, yet they will then
bee againe and againe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting
and caſting of
them up, taking a ſurvey
of their happineſs in them,
applauding their owne
hearts in their conditions.
And as rich men, that love
money, love to be looking
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:150618:45"/>
on it, and telling it over;
ſo do men to be ſumming
up their comforts and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
they enjoy,
which others want; as,
how rich they are, how
great, how they excell o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in parts and gifts,
&amp;c. Oh how much of that
precious ſand of our
thoughts runne out this
way! Thus he in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell,
hee keepes an audit
in his heart; <hi>Soule</hi> (ſaith
he) <hi>thou haſt goods laid up
for many yeares.</hi> So <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
Eſter.</hi> 5. 11. takes an
Inventory of his honours
and goods, he talkes <hi>of all
the glory of his riches, and
all the things wherein the
King had promoted him.
So Nebuchadnezzar, Dan.</hi>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:150618:46"/>
4. 30. as it may ſeeme, hee
was alone walking and
talking to himſelfe, like a
foole, ſaying to himſelfe;
<hi>Is not this the great</hi> Babell
<hi>which I have built by the
might of my power, for
the glory of my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as thus upon their
comforts, ſo alſo upon
their excellencies, as their
learning, wiſdome, parts,
&amp;c. Men love to ſtand
looking upon theſe in the
glaſſe of their owne ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation,
as faire fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
love to looke often
and long in Looking-glaſſes:
which, as it ariſeth
from that ſelfe-flattery is
in men; ſo alſo that they
might keepe their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:150618:46"/>
ſtill freſh and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in their eye; which
thoughts, when they raiſe
not up the heart to thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
to God, and are
not uſed to that end, but
are bellows of pride; they
are vaine and abominable
in the <hi>eyes</hi> of God, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
by Gods dealing
with thoſe fore-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
for to the one hee
ſayes, <hi>Thou foole, this night;</hi>
the other, <hi>whilſt the word
was in his mouth,</hi> (giving
him no longer warning)
hee ſtrikes with madneſſe
and brutiſhneſſe: and <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
you know, was like a
<hi>Wall</hi> that doth <hi>ſwell</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it <hi>breakes,</hi> and falls to
ruine and decay.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>this ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:150618:47"/>
enjoying of pleaſures,
and acting over ſinnes thus
in fancy, doth appeare in
regard <hi>of things to come;</hi>
which when wee have in
view, or any hopes of
mens thoughts goe forth
afore to meet them, with
how much contentment
doe mens thoughts enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
their deſires, with
vaine promiſings and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations
afore-hand of
their pleaſures, that are in
view and in poſſibility to
bee enjoyed. So they in
<hi>Eſay</hi> wind up their hearts
to a higher pin of jollity
in the midſt of their cups,
in that their hearts
thought and promiſed
them, <hi>To morrow ſhall bee
as to day, and much more
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:150618:47"/>
abundant, Iſay</hi> 56. 12. So
they, <hi>Iames</hi> 4. 13. they
ſay with themſelves, <hi>Wee
will goe to ſuch a City, and
continue there a yeare, and
get gaine.</hi> And the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of this, and the
thoughts of it afore-hand
feeds them, and keepes up
their hearts in comfort.
When men riſe in a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
they begin to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinke
with much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
what carnall plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
they have the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſion
and promiſe of
that day or weeke, as to
goe to ſuch company, and
there bee merry; to goe
ſuch a pleaſant journey,
enjoy ſatisfaction in ſuch
a luſt, heare ſuch newes,
&amp;c. And thus as godly
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:150618:48"/>
men <hi>live by faith</hi> in Gods
promiſes, <hi>Hab. 2. 4. Iſay
38. 16. By theſe men live,
and this is the ſpirit of my
life,</hi> ſaith <hi>Hezechiah,</hi> even
<hi>what God hath ſpoken, verſ.</hi>
15. So doe carnall men
live much upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
of their owne hearts
and thoughts afore-hand,
(for to this head of vaine
thoughts, theſe <hi>vaine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſings</hi>
are to be reduced,
<hi>Pſalm. 49. 11. Their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
thought is, their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
ſhall continue for ever,</hi>
and this thought pleaſeth
them:) what pleaſure al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
is there, which a
man makes much account
of, but hee acts it firſt over
in private in his owne
thoughts? and thus doe
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:150618:48"/>
men fooliſhly take their
owne words and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
and ſo <hi>befoole
themſelves in the end,</hi> as
<hi>Ieremy</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 17.
They take up before-hand
in their thoughts upon
truſt, the pleaſures they
are to enjoy, even as
ſpend-thrifts doe their
rents, or Heires their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venews
before they come
of age to enjoy their
lands, that when they
come indeed to enjoy the
pleaſures they expected,
either they prove but
<hi>dreames,</hi> as <hi>Iſay</hi> 29. 6.
they finde their <hi>ſoules
empty;</hi> or ſo much under
their expectation, and ſo
ſtale, as they have little in
them, that there ſtill
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:150618:49"/>
proves more in the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
than in the thing,
which ariſeth from the
vaſtneſſe and greedineſs of
mens deſires, as the cauſe
hereof; for that makes
them ſwallow up all at
once. So <hi>Hab. 2. Enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his deſires as Hell, hee
heapes up all Nations, ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
them up in his
thoughts.</hi> So an ambitious
Scholler doth all prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that are in his
view.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, this <hi>ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
wickedneſſe</hi> is exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in like maner towards
<hi>things paſt,</hi> in recalling
namely, and reviving in
our thoughts the pleaſure
of ſinfull actions paſſed;
when the minde runnes
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:150618:49"/>
over the paſſages and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of the ſame
ſins long ſince committed,
with a new and freſh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light;
when men raiſe up
their dead actions long
ſince buried, in the ſame
likeneſſe they were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
in, and parley with
them, as the Witch &amp; <hi>Saul</hi>
did with Satan in <hi>Samuels</hi>
likeneſſe. And whereas
they ſhould draw croſſe
lines over them, and blot
them out through faith in
Chriſts blood, they rather
copy and write them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
againe in their
thoughts, with the ſame
contentment. So an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane
perſon can ſtudy
and view over every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
paſſed in ſuch
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:150618:50"/>
an act, with ſuch a perſon
committed; ſo a vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious
Scholler doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate
in his thoughts an
eminent performance of
his, and all ſuch paſſages
therein as were moſt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant.
And thus men chew
the cudd upon any ſpeech
of commendation uttered
by others of them. And
all this even as a good
heart doth repeate good
things heard or read, with
the remembrance alſo of
what quickneſſe they had
in ſuch and ſuch paſſages,
and with what affections
they were warmed, when
they heard them; or as a
godly man recalls with
comfort the actions of a
well-paſt life, as <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiah</hi>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:150618:50"/>
did, <hi>Lord I have
walked before thee with a
perfect heart;</hi> and thereby
doe alſo ſtirre and provoke
their hearts to the like
temper againe: So on the
contrary, doe wicked men
uſe to recall, and revive
the pleaſingeſt ſinfull paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
in their lives, to ſuck
a new ſweetneſſe out of
them: Then which nothing
argues more <hi>hardneſſe</hi> and
<hi>wickedneſſe</hi> of heart, or
provokes God more. For,</p>
            <p>Firſt, it argues much
<hi>wickedneſſe</hi> of heart, and
ſuch as when it is ordinary
with the heart to doe thus,
is not compatible with
grace: for in the 6. of the
<hi>Romans, ver.</hi> 12. the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
ſhewes that a good
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:150618:51"/>
heart uſeth to reape no
ſuch fruit of ſinfull acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
paſt, <hi>But what fruit
had you of thoſe things
whereof yee are now aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med?</hi>
The Saints reap and
diſtill nothing out of all
thoſe flowers, but ſhame
and ſorrow, and ſad ſighs:
when <hi>Ephraim</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
his ſinne, he was <hi>aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
&amp; repented;</hi> and canſt
thou in thy thoughts, reap
a new harveſt and crop of
pleaſure out of them, again
and againe?</p>
            <p>Secondly, it argues
much hardneſſe of heart;
nothing being more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
to the truth and
practice of repentance, the
foundation of which is to
call to mind the ſinne with
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:150618:51"/>
ſhame and ſorrow, and to
recall it with much more
griefe, than ever there
was pleaſure in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
of it: and whoſe
property is to <hi>hate</hi> the <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance</hi>
of it, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame
the heart with <hi>Zeale</hi>
and revenge againſt it.
And thereby it provoketh
God exceedingly, our
hearts are thereby embru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in a new guilt, wee
thereby ſtand to, and
make good our former
act: even ſo, by remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
it with pleaſure, wee
provoke God to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
it with a new deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it, and ſo to ſend
downe new plagues; who,
if wee recall it with griefe,
<hi>would remember it no more:</hi>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:150618:52"/>
wee ſhew wee take delight
to rake in thoſe wounds
wee have given Chriſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready;
to view <hi>the ſinnes of
others</hi> with pleaſure, <hi>Rom.
1. ult.</hi> is made more <hi>than to
commit them:</hi> But much
more to view and revive
our owne with a freſh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light:
and therefore know
that how-ever you may
take delight here to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
to your ſelves your
old ſins, yet that in Hell
nothing will gall you
more, than the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of them; every
circumſtance in every ſin
will then be as a dagger at
thy heart. This was the
rich mans taske and ſtudy
in Hell, to <hi>remember the
good things hee had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:150618:52"/>
and his ſins commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the abuſe of them.
And if godly men here be
made to <hi>poſſeſſe the ſinnes
of their youth with horrour,</hi>
as <hi>Iob, and to have them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
afore them,</hi> as <hi>David,</hi>
how will wicked men
bee continually affrighted
with them in hell? whoſe
puniſhment is in a great
part ſet forth to us, by
this <hi>Pſalme 50. 20. I will
ſet them in order before
thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, the fourth
thing wherein this <hi>ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
vanity</hi> appeares, is in
acting ſinnes upon meere
imaginary ſuppoſitions
men faigne, and contrive
to themſelves, and make a
ſuppoſition to themſelves
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:150618:53"/>
in their own thoughts, firſt
of what <hi>they would bee,</hi> and
<hi>then</hi> what <hi>they would doe.</hi>
Men create fooles paradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to themſelves, and
then walke up and downe
in them; as, if they had
money enough, what plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
they would have; if
they were in ſuch places
of preferment, how they
would carry themſelves.
To allude to that <hi>Abſolom</hi>
ſaid, 2 <hi>Sam. 15. 4. Oh if I
were a Iudge in the Land, I
would doe this or that, &amp;c.</hi>
doing this with a great
deale of pleaſure, almoſt as
much as thoſe that really
enjoy them. This may
well bee the meaning of
that <hi>Pſalme</hi> 50. 18. where
of the hypocrite (who
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:150618:53"/>
outwardly abſtaines from
groſſe ſins) 'tis ſaid, that
<hi>hee conſenteth with the
thiefe, and partaketh with
the adulterer,</hi> namely, in
his <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>fancie,</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
himſelf with them,
and ſo deſires to bee
doing what they doe.
Thus take one who is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
ambitious (whom
both nature, parts and
education have all made,
but a <hi>Bramble never to
rule over the trees,</hi> and
hath fixt in a lower ſphere,
as uncapable of riſing
higher or being greater,
as the earth is of becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
a Starre in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
yet) hee will take
upon him in his owne
heart, faining and ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:150618:54"/>
himſelfe to bee, and
then act the part of a
great man there, erect a
throne, and ſit downe in
it; and thinkes with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
what hee would doe,
if a King or a great Man,
&amp;c. So take a man that is
uncleane, but now growne
old, and a <hi>dry tree,</hi> and ſo
cannot act his luſt as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
yet his thoughts
ſhall ſupply what is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in his ſtrength or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity.
And he makes
his owne heart both
Bawd, Brothel houſe,
Whore, Whoremonger,
and all: ſo a man that is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
voluptuous, loves
pleaſures, but wants
meanes to purchaſe them,
yet his inclinations will
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:150618:54"/>
pleaſe themſelves with
the thoughts of what
mixture and compoſition
of delights hee would
have; hee will ſet downe
with himſelfe his Bill of
fare, how hee would have,
if he might wiſh, his cup of
pleaſure mingled, what
ingredients put into it. So
a man that is revengefull,
and yet wants a ſting, yet
he pleaſeth himſelfe with
revengefull thoughts and
wiſhes, and will be making
invectives and railing dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues
againſt him, hee
hates, when hee is not by.
A man in love, in his fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
hee will court his Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
though abſent, he
will by his imagination
make her preſent, and ſo
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:150618:55"/>
frame ſolemn ſet ſpeeches
to her.</p>
            <p>In a word, let mens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
and diſpoſitions
bee of what kinde ſo ever,
and let the impoſſibilities
and improbabilities be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo great of being what
they deſire; yet in their
fancies and thoughts they
will diſcover themſelves
what they would be. <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumque
quod eſſe deſiderant
ſibi apud ſemetipſos cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionibus
depingunt,</hi> men
will bee drawing Maps of
their deſires, calculate
their owne inclinations,
cut out a condition of life
which fills their hearts,
and they pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
withall: and there
is no ſurer way to know a
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:150618:55"/>
mans naturall inclination,
than by this.</p>
            <p>Firſt, which yet firſt is
as great a folly as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
imitating children
herein; for is it not chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh
to make clay pies, and
puppets? what elſe are
ſuch fancies as theſe? and
to bee as children acting
the parts of Ladies and
Miſtreſſes, and yet ſuch
<hi>childiſhneſſe</hi> is in mens
hearts.</p>
            <p>2. And ſecondly, a
<hi>vanitie</hi> alſo, becauſe a
man ſets his heart on
<hi>what is not:</hi> the things
themſelves are not, if a
man had them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 5.
but to pleaſe themſelves
with ſuppoſitions is much
worſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:150618:56"/>
Thirdly, this argues
the greateſt incontentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of minde that may
bee, when men will in
their owne thoughts put
themſelves into another
condition than God ever
ordained for them.</p>

greater and deeper humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,
as arguing full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of ones guilt, <hi>Rom.
3. 19. Every mouth muſt
be ſtopped.</hi> Having nothing
to ſay, not to plead and
excuſe, that thoughts are
free, and it is impoſſible to
bee rid of them, &amp;c, but as
<hi>Ezechiel, 16. 65. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
and to bee confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and never to open thy

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:150618:57"/>
not to anſwer againe,</hi> as <hi>Iob</hi>
39. 27, 28. this is to lay thy
hand on thy mouth, that is,
to humble thy ſelfe.</p>
               <p>And indeed there is
much cauſe, for your
thoughts they are the firſt
begotten, and eldeſt ſons
of originall ſin, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>the ſtrength of it,</hi> as
<hi>Iacob</hi> called <hi>Reuben</hi> the

the <hi>Parents</hi> and begetters
of all other ſinnes, their

and contrivers, and
<hi>Achitophels,</hi> in all the
treaſons and rebellions of
our hearts and lives; the
bellows and incendiaries
of all inordinate affections;
the Panders to all our
luſts, that <hi>take thought</hi> to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:150618:57"/>
provide for the ſatisfying
of them; the diſturbers in
all good duties, that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
and ſpoile and fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blow
all our prayers, that
they ſtinke in the noſtrills
of God.</p>
               <p>And if their hainouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
will nothing move
you, conſider their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
for they are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
thus: which makes
our ſinnes to be in number
more than the ſands: the
thoughts of <hi>Solomons</hi> heart
were as the Sand, and ſo
ours; not a minute, but as
many thoughts paſſe from
us, as in a minute ſands doe
in an Houre-glaſſe. So that
ſuppoſe, that taken ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
they be the ſmalleſt
and leaſt of your ſinnes,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:150618:58"/>
yet their <hi>multitude</hi> makes
them more and heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than all your other.
Nothing ſmaller than a

bee a heape of them, there
is nothing <hi>heavier, Iob 6. 3.
My griefe is heavier than
the Sand.</hi> Suppoſe they be

in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of groſſe defilements:
yet becauſe the Mint never
lies ſtill, ſleeping nor wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
therefore they make
up the greateſt part of that
treaſure of wrath which
wee are a laying up: and
know that God will rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon
every Farthing, and in
thy puniſhment bate thee
not one vaine thought.
And that God lookes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:150618:58"/>
our thoughts thus, ſee
but the inditement he
brings in againſt the old
world; which ſtands ſtill
upon record, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. when
he pronounced that heavy
judgement of deſtroying
the old world, doth he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
their murthers, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
and groſſe defilements
chiefly as the cauſe?
Their <hi>thoughts</hi> rather;
which becauſe ſo many,
and ſo <hi>continually evill,</hi>
provoked him more than
all their other ſinnes. Goe
downe therefore into thy
heart, and conſider them
well, to humble thee, to
make thee vile, and if in
one roome ſuch a treaſure
of wickedneſſe bee found
laid up, what in all thoſe
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:150618:59"/>
other <hi>Chambers of the belly,</hi>
as <hi>Solomon</hi> calls them?
conſider them to humble
thee, but not for all this
their multitude to diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
thee. For God hath
<hi>more thoughts of mercy</hi> in
him, than thou haſt had of
rebellion, <hi>Pſal. 40. 5. Thy
thoughts to us-ward,</hi> (ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

<hi>are more than can bee

but as yeſterday to thinke
thoughts of rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, but his thoughts
of mercy have beene <hi>from
everlaſting,</hi> and reach to
<hi>everlaſting:</hi> and therefore
in <hi>Eſay 55. verſ.</hi> 7. having
made mention of <hi>our

man forſake his thoughts,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:150618:59"/>
and hee will have mercy on
him;</hi> becauſe this object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion
of the multitude might
come in to diſcourage men
from hopes of mercy,
therefore purpoſely hee

that hee hath thoughts of

               <head>Remedies againſt vaine
Thoughts.</head>
               <p>THe firſt is to get the
heart furniſhed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched
with a good ſtocke
of ſanctified and heavenly
knowledge in ſpirituall and
heavenly truths: <hi>For a
good man</hi> (ſaith Chriſt)
<hi>hath a good treaſure</hi> in his
<hi>Heart, Matt.</hi> 13. 35. that
is, hee hath all graces,
ſo many precious truths
which are as Gold in the
Ore, which his thoughts,
as the Mint, doth coine and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:150618:63"/>
beat out, and which words
bring forth. <hi>A good man,
out of the good treaſure of
his heart, brings forth good
things.</hi> If therefore there
bee not Mines of precious
truths hid in the heart, no
wonder if our thoughts
coyne nothing but droſſe,
frothy vaine thoughts, for
want of better materialls
which ſhould feed the
Mint, are wanting. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Wicked

<hi>wickedneſſe, Pro.</hi> 6. 14.
ſo <hi>Iunius</hi> reads it: or if
men have ſtore of naturall
knowledge, and want ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
uſefull knowledge,
to themſelves; although
in company with others,
they may bring forth good
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:150618:64"/>
things in ſpeeches, yet
when alone, their thoughts
runne not on them. For
this, take a place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 6, 7. which
ſhewes, that laying up the
Word in the heart, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much converſant in it,
and getting knowledge
out of it, is an effectuall
meanes to keepe our
thoughts well exerciſed
when wee are alone: for
the end why theſe words
are commanded <hi>to bee laid
up in the heart, ver.</hi> 5, 6. is,
as to teach them to others,
ſo, to take up our thoughts
when we are moſt retired,
and alone, and when a man
can doe nothing, but bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exerciſe his minde, in
thinking; for when a man
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:150618:64"/>
is a <hi>riding,</hi> or <hi>walking,</hi> or

<hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 22. with this place
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:150618:65"/>
(which will fitly interpret
it) it appeares; for <hi>Solomon</hi>
exhorting to the ſame du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Binding the Word to
the heart,</hi> uſeth this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
which is the fruit
thereof, <hi>That when thou a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakeſt,
it ſhall talke with
thee,</hi> that is, by thy think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, it will talke with
thee when thou and it art
alone: So as thou ſhalt not
need a better companion,
it will bee putting in and
ſuggeſting ſome thing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, endeavour to
preſerve and keep up live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
holy, and ſpirituall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
in thy heart, and
ſuffer them not to coole;
<hi>Fall not from thy firſt love,</hi>
nor feare, nor joy in God;
or if thou haſt growne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:150618:65"/>
endeavour to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
thoſe affections again.
For ſuch as your affections
are, ſuch neceſſarily muſt
your thoughts be: and they
encline the minde to think
of ſuch or ſuch objects as
will pleaſe them, rather
than others; therefore
ſayes <hi>David, Pſal. 119. 97.
How doe I love thy Law! it
is my meditation day and
night.</hi> It was his love to it
made him thinke of it ſo
frequently. So <hi>Mal. 3. 16.
Thoſe that feared the Lord,
and thought upon his Name,</hi>
are joyned: For what we
feare wee often thinke of,
and alſo ſpeake of often;
therefore it is added; <hi>They
ſpake of one to another; feare</hi>
made them <hi>thinke</hi> much <hi>of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:150618:66"/>
his name,</hi> and thinking of it
made <hi>them ſpeake of it:</hi> ſuch
affection, ſuch thoughts,
and ſuch ſpeeches, as they
both are. And indeede
thoughts and affections are

cauſes of each other:
<hi>Whileſt I muſed, the fire bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
Pſalm.</hi> 39. ſo that
thoughts are the bellowes
that kindle and enflame
affections: and then if
they are enflamed, they
cauſe thoughts to boile,
therefore men newly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
to God, having new
and ſtrong affections, can
with more pleaſure thinke
of God <hi>than any.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, of all appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
elſe, get thy heart
poſſeſſed with deep, ſtrong
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:150618:66"/>
and powerfull apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and impreſſions of
<hi>Gods Holineſs, Majeſtie,
Omnipreſence, and Omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi>
If any thoughts bee
of power to ſettle, fixe,
and draw in the minde of
man, they are the <hi>thoughts
of him.</hi> What is the reaſon
that the Saints and Angels
in Heaven have not a vaine
thought to eternity, not a
wry ſtroke, his preſence
fixeth them, their eie is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
off him? Take a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
gariſh looſe ſpirit, let
him be but in the preſence
of a Superiour whom hee
feares and reverenceth,
and it conſolidates him.
<hi>Iob</hi> made therefore conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of his thoughts, that
hee durſt not looke awry,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:150618:67"/>
                  <hi>Iob</hi> 31. 1, 2. becauſe God
<hi>ſees it,</hi> ſaith hee. This drew
in and faſtned <hi>Davids</hi>
thoughts, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. from
the firſt to the twelfth, he
manifeſts what continuall
apprehenſion hee had of
Gods Greatneſſe, Majeſty,
and Omnipreſence; and
what effect had this? <hi>When

thee, verſe</hi> 17. Looke what
objects they are, have moſt
ſtrong and deepe impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

when a man awaketh, hee
thinkes of firſt. Now ſuch
ſtrong impreſſions had <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
thoughts of God, that
ſtill when hee awaked, hee
was with him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wee finde it by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
to bee a meanes to

avoid diſtractions in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
to enlarge a mans
thoughts in his preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
before, or at the beginning
with a conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Gods attributes and
relations to us: and it will
and doth make us ſerious.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, eſpecially do
this when thou <hi>awakeſt,</hi> as
<hi>David</hi> did there, <hi>when I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake</hi>
I am ſtill with thee: to
prevent winde which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth

uſe to take a good draught
in the morning, which the

thoſe vaine, windy,
frothy thoughts the heart
naturally ingenders, and
which ariſe from empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
firſt fill thy heart
with the thoughts of God;
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:150618:68"/>
                  <hi>Goe downe into his Wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celler:</hi>
obſerve it when you
will, when you firſt open
your eyes, there ſtand ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſuitors attending on
you, to ſpeake with your
thoughts, even as Cliants
at Lawyers doores, many
vanities and buſineſſes; but
ſpeake thou with God firſt,
hee will ſay ſomething to
thy heart, will ſettle it for
all day: and this doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the croud of buſineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
come in upon thee. Of
ſome Heathens it is ſaid
that they worſhip <hi>that</hi> as
their <hi>God,</hi> for all day,
which they firſt ſee in the
morning; ſo it is with the
idols of mens hearts.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, have a watchfull
eye, and obſerve thy heart
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:150618:68"/>
all day, though they croud
in, yet obſerve them, let
them know that they paſſe
not unſeene; if a man
would pray aright, he muſt
watch alſo, who comes in,
and who goes out: where
ſtrict watch and ward is
kept, and Magiſtrates ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant,
the Marſhall and
Conſtable diligent to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
vagrant perſons, you
ſhall have few there; that
ſuch ſwarmes of vagrant
thoughts make their ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devous,
and paſſe, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there is not ſtrict
watch kept.</p>
               <p>This is in a manner all
thou canſt doe, for they
will paſſe however, but
yet complaine thou of
them, whip them, and give
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:150618:69"/>
them their paſſe.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, pleaſe not thy
fancy too much with vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and curious ſights, this
engenders vaine thoughts;
therefore <hi>Iob</hi> ſayes, <hi>Chap.
31. verſ. 1. That hee made

               </p>
               <p>Seventhly, bee diligent

When <hi>David</hi> walked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
what extravagancy
did his ſpirit run into? let
the ground lye fallow,
and what weeds will there
ſoone grow in it? God
hath appointed us our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
to entertaine our
thoughts, and to finde
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:150618:70"/>
them worke, and to hold
them doing in the <hi>interims,</hi>
between the duties of his
worſhip, becauſe the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and thoughts of men
are reſtleſſe, and will bee
buſied ſome way; as ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Kings keep thoſe men
that have active ſpirits in
continual imployment, leſt
their heads ſhould be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
and plotting amiſſe:
ſo did God appoint even in
Paradiſe the active ſpirit
of man, a calling to keepe
him doing. God hereby
hedgeth in mans thoughts,
and ſets them to goe in a
narrow lane, knowing that
if they are unconfined and
left at liberty, they would
like wilde <hi>Aſſes ſnuffe up
the winde,</hi> as <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſpeaks,

heed of encumbring thy
minde with too much bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe,
more than thou

forget that <hi>one thing
neceſſary,</hi> being <hi>cumbred
with many things, Luke</hi> 10.

                  </gap>,
which diſtracts the minde,
(ſo the word ſignifies <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
as <hi>dividing it,</hi> and
ſo cauſeth wandering

ſo that the minde is not it

<hi>Thou wilt fade away as a

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:150618:71"/>
that juyce which ſhould be

be exhauſted: as dreames

do a multitude of thoughts
from a cumber of buſineſs.</p>
               <p>Eightly, in thy calling,
and all thy wayes, for the
ſucceſſe and thy wayes
therein, <hi>Commit thy wayes
to God, Prov. 16. 3. Commit
thy way unto the Lord, and
thy thoughts ſhall be eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
or ordered:</hi> that is, kept
from that confuſion and
diſorder, and thoſe ſwarms
of cares, which others are
annoyed with: and thereby
thy aimes may bee as well
accompliſhed: a few
thoughts of faith would
ſave us many thoughts of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:150618:71"/>
cares and feares, in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes
wee goe about,
which prove therefore
<hi>vaine,</hi> becauſe they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
not at all the buſineſſe
wee intend. When
ſuch waves toſſe the heart
and turmoile it, and the
windes of paſſions are up,
if a few thoughts of
faith come into the
heart, they calm
all preſently.</p>
