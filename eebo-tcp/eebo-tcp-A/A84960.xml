            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Barbarous and Bloody Murther,
Committed by
Edward Williams,
ON THE
Body of Mr. Hinton,
At the <hi>Windſor-Caſtle</hi> in <hi>Green-Dragon Court,</hi> near <hi>Charing-Croſs,</hi> on <hi>Thurſday</hi> laſt: With
the occaſion of their Quarrel, and manner of the Murther; and how the Coroners In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt

            <p>MR. <hi>Hinton</hi> formerly a Trooper in the Kings Guards, and lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved

in <hi>Green-Dragon-Court</hi> in the <hi>Strand,</hi> where he had kept an Ale-Houſe
for about Two Months, and having been ſome Days out of Town on ſome
extraordinary Buſineſs, leaving his Wife to mannage affairs in his abſence,
but returning home on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> was Sevennight laſt, found one <hi>Edward
Williams</hi> in his Houſe, and (as ſome ſay) too familliar with his Wife, or at
leaſt took too much command upon him in his abſence, and to agravate the
matter his Wife was at the ſame time diſorder'd in Drink: Whereupon high
and provoking Word; being given on both ſides, Mr. <hi>Hinton,</hi> (tho at
other times a very moderate and peacable Man) having ſome Tobacco Pipes
in his Hand, threw them at his Wife, which occaſion'd <hi>Williams,</hi> (who was
then preſent) to draw his Sword, but <hi>Hinton's</hi> Maid in vindication of her
Maſter ſtept'd between, and endeavourd to keep them aſunder, and had in
all probability perform'd that good Office had not her Miſtreſs thruſt her
aſide; at which time (as we are inform'd) <hi>Williams</hi> taking the oppertunity,
made a paſs at Mr. <hi>Hinton,</hi> and ſuch an unfortunate one, that the point of
the Sword run into his Throat or Gullet, and (as ſome ſay) had repeated his
violence upon him had he not been prevented by Neighbours coming in; but
notwithſtanding all the endeavours that could be uſed either by Surgeons or
others, he languiſh'd from <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 30th of <hi>October</hi> till <hi>Thurſday</hi> the
7th of <hi>November</hi> and then Dyed of his Wound at which time <hi>Williams</hi> the
Murtherer made his Eſcape, and not before, having (as we are credibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd)
Din'd with <hi>Hinton's</hi> Wife ſeveral times ſince he had given him his
mortal Wound, and once ſince he Dyed; which behaviour of hers towards
the Murtherer of her own Husband, has been much taken notice of by her
Neighbours, and no leſs reflected upon by her Husbands Relations.</p>
