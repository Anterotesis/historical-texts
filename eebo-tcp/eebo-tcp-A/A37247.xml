         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

acclamation, the joy of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
at the coming of Chriſt to
<hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> for it was told them, that he would
come, but not in ſtare, but in meekneſſe: <hi>Rejoyce
greatly, oh daughter of Zion; ſhout O daughter of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem;

be honoured of them; for Chriſt is a great King,
and expected to be entertained of them as a King,
which ſhould they have denied him, the very
ſtones ſhould have given it to him; <hi>I tell you, if theſe
ſhould hold their peace, the very ſtones would cry out.</hi>
Luke 19. 40.</p>
            <p>In the two Greeke words, there is but one Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
between that which ſignifieth a ſtone, and that
which ſignifieth people: <hi>And I ſay unto you, that God
is able even of ſtones to raiſe up people,</hi> Luk. 3. 8. If the
people will not Cry <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> God can make the
ſtones to cry <hi>Hoſanna</hi> to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Yet though the Diſciples and the people, did
not cry <hi>Hoſanna</hi> to Chriſt, yet ſhould he not looſe
one jot of his honour; and though the Phariſees
and Scribes ſhould have cryed with them <hi>Hoſanna,</hi>
yet had there been nothing at all added to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
one could not encreaſe, nor the other decreaſe
one jot of his honour.</p>
            <p>Yet our bleſſed Saviour liked the one, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
the other; not that he needed it, but Chriſt
expected it, becauſe it was his due, and <hi>the people
ſpread their garments, and took Palmes in their hands,
and cryed Hoſanna.</hi> This is recorded by all the
foure Evangeliſts, ſave onely one, to ſhew that it
is a matter of moment; <hi>Mathew</hi> hath it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 9.
<hi>Mark</hi> 9. 11. and S. <hi>Iohn</hi> as it is here in the Text.
Though <hi>Mathew</hi> writ in Hebrew, <hi>Marke</hi> in Latin,
and <hi>Iohn</hi> in Greeke; yet all uſe the ſame word <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanna,</hi>
as ſome ſay; becauſe in this they would not
alter the Jewes language, it being the very word
they uſed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:62873:3"/>
Others are of opinion that the matter that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in this word could not be fully expreſt in
any other language, and therefore they would not
tranſlate it, becauſe they would not looſe the force
of the word.</p>
            <p>But this we may be ſure of, that certainly they
did not do it with any intent to make the world
ignorant of the meaning of it; if I know not the
meaning of the voice, <hi>I ſhall be unto him that ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
a Barbarian, and he that ſpeaketh ſhall be a Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
unto me.</hi> 1. Cor. 14. 11.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Ptolemeus Philadelphus</hi> had found an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
Bible in his Library, he ſpake to this effect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
What ſhall it profit me, quoth he, to have a Bible,
and cannot underſtand what is in it? So he ſent for
Schollers that came unto him, and tranſlated it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his own language.</p>
            <p>This word <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> here, is either ſupplitory,
to beſeech for benefit to be received: or gratulato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
thanks for benefits received alreadie.</p>
            <p>They who hold it <hi>ſupplitory,</hi> look upon the word
in the Etymologie of it; and they who hold it <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulatory,</hi>
they look upon the meaning of the word;
but we will have reſpect to both.</p>
            <p>1. For the perfect ſignification of the word <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanna,</hi>
according to the Etymologie of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thus
ſome compare it with the Pſalmiſt: Save thou; and
thus it is a plain prayer: as it is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118. And then
we muſt underſtand; 1. who is prayed for. 2. What
is prayed for. Thus ſome underſtand it, to be a
prayer to God for Chriſt: others, to be a prayer
to Chriſt for the people: and that thus.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:62873:4"/>
1. O God ſave the Son of <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. O ſave thou us thou Son of <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the firſt is ſet down Chriſts weakneſſe, as he
is man. In the ſecond is ſet forth his power as he
is God.</p>
            <p>In the firſt as he is man: in the ſecond as he is the
Saviour of men: both which he was on earth, and
both which he is now in heaven. Then mutable,
but immutable now.</p>
            <p>If this acclamation did flow from the people
naturally of their own accord, it was then for
Chriſt, whom they eſteemed but man: yet they
prayed for him as their King, as we ought all to
do, eſpecially for them that are in authority, as it
is, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2.</p>
            <p>He that was the firſt King, and one of the worſt
too, was to be prayed for: much more, a good
King, and for ſuch in Authoritie as fear God.</p>
            <p>But I think it was not they themſelves, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Spirit of God in them that cried <hi>Hoſanna:</hi>
who knew Chriſt to be their King by the ſame
Spirit, and then <hi>Hoſanna</hi> is a prayer to Chriſt the
Son of <hi>David,</hi> for the people of Iſrael, to ſave
them, for beſides him there is no Saviour, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.
11. <hi>An horſe is a vain thing for ſafety, neither ſhall he
deliver any by his great ſtrength,</hi> Pſal. 33. 17. And as
vain a thing is man to ſave a man, a mightie man
is not delivered by an hoaſt, or by much ſtrength,
a Prince cannot ſave a man. Therefore put not
your truſt in Princes, but in the Lord.</p>
            <p>If the Lord ſeaſe upon you, nothing can take
you out of his hands: but who ever ſeaſeth on you,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62873:4"/>
if God will ſave you, then are you ſafe from all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
you ſhall not periſh.</p>
            <p>And this is our comfort, that as Chriſt is God
able to ſave us: ſo is he man alſo, touched with the
ſence of our infirmities; he is no hireling, but the
good Shepherd that will deliver his lambs, from
all Bears, and Lions. As <hi>David</hi> did deliver his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſheep out of the paw of the Lion, and the
Bear; ſo will Chriſt alſo deliver his ſheep, though
the Lions and the Bears be readie to devoure them.</p>
            <p>Chriſt is our head, and we are his members; now
the head is the head of life, and motion, &amp;c. to the
body, and ſo is Chriſt the fountain of all the true
health of the ſoul, to him we ought to cry <hi>Hoſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,
O Lord ſave us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither are we onely to cry <hi>Hoſanna</hi> to Chriſt
as King alone, and ſo to defend us againſt our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
the world, the fleſh, and the devill: but as
Prieſt alſo, to reconcile us to the Lord. Let us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon
all our own power, and all that we can do,
and relie on the ſacrifice of our Prieſt and Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciler,
Jeſus Chriſt. Neither are we onely to cry
<hi>Hoſanna</hi> to him as King, and as Prieſt alone, but as
our Prophet alſo, to inſtruct us through this vale
of miſery, till we arrive at our eternall bliſſe with
him in heaven.</p>
            <p>2. In the next place we muſt look upon the word
in the ſignification congratulatory; Thanks is ſo
neceſſary, that ſuch is the condition of men, that to
be unthankfull, is to be unworthy of the ſocietie
of men: an unthankfull man is ſuch an one from
whom no good can be expected.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:62873:5"/>
Jeſus Chriſt hath done exceedingly for us, and
we are infinitely bound to be thankfull to him.
Look upon man, in his fall, and he is worſe then
any creature, like the beaſts that periſh, therefore
worſe then beaſts: not ſo good, onely made like
them, not quite ſo good.</p>
            <p>Angels are glorious ſpirits placed in the preſence
of God himſelf, when they fell, our Saviour never
looked after them; but he took our nature upon
him, to ſave us: he took not upon him the nature of
Angels, but the ſeed of <hi>Abraham.</hi> He that was God
took upon him the form of a ſervant, and became
man, this work he undertook for us, and this work
he performed. Therefore it behoved the people
to cry <hi>Hoſanna:</hi> And here it is to be obſerved, that
the people that went before, and they that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
after, both cried <hi>Hoſanna.</hi> So ought thoſe people
under the Law before Chriſt, and we alſo under the
Goſpel after Chriſt, all ought to cry <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> like
the two faces of the Cherubims, that looked both
wayes on the Mercy ſeat, both they before, and we
after ought all to turn our faces upon Chriſt; cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Hoſanna</hi> to the Son of <hi>David.</hi>
