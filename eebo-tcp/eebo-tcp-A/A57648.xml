            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that was done only by uttering thy

may be made good by his
love and kindnesse. 2. As no
man is so bad, in whom there
is not some goodnesse; and no
man so good, in whom there is
not some wickednesse: so God
is not so unjust, as to suffer the
one to goe unpunished; nor is
he so mercilesse, as to suffer the
other to goe unrewarded.
3. As he sheweth mercie to the
bad, and to those by whom he
is hated; he will teach us, by
his example, how to carrie our
selves to those by whom we
are persecuted. He healed the
eare of him that came to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
him; he forgave <hi>Peter</hi>
that denyed him; he made
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:65783:72"/>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> a vessell of mercy, though
he persecuted him; he prayed
for those that crucified him;
and he died for those sheep that
went astray from him: he
causeth his sun to shine upon
the good and bad; his rain to
fall upon the just and unjust.
<hi>O my God, I acknowledge thy
goodnesse and mercie towards me
a wretched sinner, who am sold
under sin, and laden with iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
O let this thy goodnesse be a

from the course of sinne; that I

Why will you die, O

saith the Lord, I will not the
death of a sinner. Many mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
did he work to turn <hi>Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ohs</hi>
heart: sixscore yeares did
he spend to bring the first

Prophets did he send, before he
would destroy the Jewes; he
would have healed Babylon,

he would have gathered Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:65783:73"/>

How loath was he to cut down

<hi>O Lord, I confesse, that thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance
in punishing me so great
a sinner, proceeds not from any
liking thou takest in my sinning,
for thou art most good: nor for
any neglect in correcting, for
thou art most just: nor for any

               <p>God sheweth his great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie

when we are hungrie, he bids
us come and eat, for with his
own body he will feed us;
when we have fought, and got
the victorie, he will bid us
come to receive the Crown of
glorie, which he hath laid up
for us. He calls us by his Spirit
inwardly, and by his Word
outwardly: Every good moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

to him: every morning the sun
riseth, not onely to give us
light, but to invite us unto him
who is the fountain of light:
every night the moon or stars
appeare, not only to lessen the
darknesse of the aire, but also to
drive away the darknesse of the
minde; to call us both out of
corporall and spirituall obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie;
Every drop of rain, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
flower in the field, every

upon us, whether sicknesse, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertie,
banishment, imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

Heraulds sent to summon and

which shall never be quenched;
of that worm, that shall never

               <p>To shew mercy, and to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don

for God shewes mercy to all
that are in miserie, but he only
pardons their sinnes whom he
meanes to glorifie: he is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
to the wicked, in causing
his sun to shine, and his rain to
fall, and in bestowing of many
outward blessings on them; but
he pardoneth only the sins of
them, who by repentance turn
from sinne to him, and by faith
lay hold on Christ that died for
them. And, although God be
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:65783:80"/>
mercy it self, or mercifull in the
highest degree; yet, without sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
he will not pardon
iniquitie; because pardoning is
an act rather of his free will,
then of his mercy: neither is it
essentiall to his mercy to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
for so he should pardon
all to whom he is mercifull;
which is not true: and though
he is mercifull to all those
whom he pardoneth, yet the act
of pardoning is not mercy, but
the effect of mercy: for his
mercie is essentiall, immutable,
necessarie; but to pardon is a
free and mutable act: therefore,
as Gods justice is not prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by punishing one for the
sinnes of another, seeing that
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:65783:80"/>
other undertook voluntarily to
suffer punishment; so neither is
Gods mercy wronged by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
that sin for which sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
is made, because the
satisfaction was not made by
the party that offended: it was
justice then in God to punish
Christ for our sinnes, because
voluntarily he took upon him
our sinnes; so it was mercy in
God to pardon that sinne, for
which Christ had fully satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
It was justice in God the

to satisfie for us; so it was
mercy in God the Father to
apply and impute his Sonnes

thou art not bound in justice to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute

it mine; seeing by my personall
