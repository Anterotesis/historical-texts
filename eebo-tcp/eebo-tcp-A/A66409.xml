            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE are Two ways by which Mankind may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the Knowledge of Divine Things; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Natural or Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.</p>
            <p>Natural is what we have ſpringing up with our Faculties, or what we attain by Natural means, by Sight, Obſervation, and Experience, by Tradition (which is the Hiſtory of others Knowledge and Experience); and laſtly, by Reaſon and Argument, deducing Effects from their proper Cauſes, or finding out the Cauſe by its Effects: As for inſtance; Thus we come to the Knowledge of God by obſerving the Frame of the World, by the Series, Order, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62586:5"/>
Courſe of Things, which could never be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome Cauſe to produce them, and that Cauſe no leſs than One Infinitely Powerful and Wiſe. Thus we Argue, That there is a Soul in Man diſtinct from the Body, and ſurviving a Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from it; foraſmuch as there are ſuch Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations as are not Competent to Matter; and that there is ſuch a deſire of Immortality placed in Mankind, as would make the Flower and Choiceſt part of the Viſible Creation, the moſt Miſerable, if there was no Capacity in the Soul for ſuch a State, or no ſuch State for a Soul ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of it.</p>
            <p>Such Inferences as theſe, are as Natural to a Reaſonable Mind, as thoſe Obſervations are which we make from the reports of Senſe; and are therefore deſervedly accounted Branches of Natural Religion.</p>
            <p>Now this kind of Knowledge is more or leſs evident, is ſtronger or weaker, according to the capacities and diſpoſitions of Mankind, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the opportunities and means they have of Information. And therefore a Philoſopher that ſets himſelf to enquire into the Myſteries of Nature, and to obſerve the Curioſity, Order and Beauty of its Fabrick, may, in Reaſon be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be more confirmed in the Belief of a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62586:5"/>
God, and more diſpoſed to Serve and Adore him, than he that is ignorant; as he that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands Painting or Carving, can more obſerve and applaud the Ingenuity and Skill of the Artiſt, than he that is unacquainted with it.</p>
            <p>But after all, ſo much is the Subject above our reach, and ſo dark and intricate are all our Reaſonings upon it, that the Sageſt Philoſopher, in the concluſion, is left as unſatisfied as the meaneſt Peaſant; and perhaps more unſatisfied with his Knowledge, and the deep and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathomable Abyſs he ſees before him, than the other is with his Ignorance; ſo far making good what <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerves, <hi>He that increaſeth knowledge, increaſeth ſorrow,</hi> Eccleſ. 1. 18.</p>
            <p>So that there needs ſome brighter Light than that of Nature, to conduct us to Happineſs, and bring us to a compleat and entire Satisfaction; and that is a Supernatural Knowledge, a Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that is not to be obtained by the ways aforeſaid, by Enquiry and Obſervation, but by inſpiration and Revelation from Almighty God.</p>
            <p>And this is the Subject of the Text.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God who at ſundry times, and in divers manners, ſpake in time paſt by the Prophets, hath in theſe laſt days ſpoken unto us by his Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:62586:6"/>
In which Words we have,</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Deſcription given of Revelation, <hi>it's God's ſpeaking to the Fathers,</hi> &amp;c. that is, it is God's delivering his Mind to Mankind by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons choſen for that purpoſe, and peculiarly fitted for it by Inſpiration. Such were the Prophets <hi>in time paſt,</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> in the <hi>laſt days.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2. The certainty of it; it is by way of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,</hi> God who at ſundry times, and in divers man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſpake, &amp;c. <hi>The Apoſtle takes this for granted, as having been ſufficiently proved, and ſo needs no farther confirmation. So it was in</hi> times paſt, <hi>when</hi> God ſpake by the Prophets; <hi>and ſo it was in</hi> the laſt days <hi>in the Revelation of the Goſpel,</hi> which at the firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord, and was, <hi>ſaith our Apoſtle,</hi> confirmed unto us by them that heard him: God alſo bearing them witneſs both with ſigns and wonders, and with divers miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Chap. 2. 3, 4.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore as <hi>Moſes</hi> did not think himſelf obliged at the entrance into his Divine Work, to prove there is a God, and that God made the World, when there is ſuch an inbred knowledge of a Deity implanted in human Nature, and ſuch clear and undoubted evidences of it through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Univerſe; but ſuppoſes and aſſerts it, <hi>In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth:</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:62586:6"/>
So after ſuch manifeſt proofs of the Divine Authority of both the Prophetical and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Revelation, the Apoſtle would not ſo much as ſuppoſe any doubt in the minds of thoſe he wrote to; but begins his Epiſtle, with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Majeſty becoming an Inſpired Author, <hi>God who at ſundry times,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Order obſerved in delivering that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, it was <hi>at ſundry times, and in divers manners.</hi>

            <p n="4">4. The Perfection and Completion of Divine Revelation; <hi>God hath in theſe laſt days ſpoken by his Son.</hi> So that what was gradually, and <hi>at ſundry times,</hi> delivered <hi>in time paſt to the Prophets,</hi> was at
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62586:7"/>
once intirely and perfectly Revealed by the Son of God, <hi>whom he hath appointed heir of all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Under the Firſt of theſe I ſhall ſhew,</p>
            <p n="1">1. What we mean by Revelation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The poſſibility of God's Revealing himſelf ſo to the Creature, that the Creature ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly and evidently know that it is God that ſpeaketh.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Expediency, Uſefulneſs, and Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of a Revelation, with reſpect to the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances Mankind are in.</p>
            <p>Under the Second I ſhall ſhew,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That as it's poſſible for God to Reveal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and Expedient and Neceſſary for man that there ſhould be a Revelation; ſo God has actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thus Revealed himſelf <hi>at ſundry times, and in divers manners by the Prophets,</hi> through the ſeveral Periods before ſpoken of, and <hi>in the laſt days by his Son.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. I ſhall conſider the difference between a real and pretended Revelation, and how we may diſtinguiſh the true from the falſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I ſhall ſhew, that the Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament contain the matter of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation, and have upon them the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters belonging to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:62586:7"/>
Under the Third,</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſhall conſider the ſeveral ways by which God did Reveal himſelf <hi>in times paſt by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> as by Illapſes, Inſpirations, Viſions, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I ſhall endeavour to ſhew the difference between Divine Inſpirations, and Diabolical Illuſions, Natural Impreſſions, and Deluſory Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I ſhall conſider the ſeveral Periods before the Law, under the Law, and under the Goſpel; and the gradual progreſs of Revelation from firſt to laſt, from the lower to the higher degree, and the perpetual reſpect one had to the other.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I ſhall conſider why God did thus gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and at <hi>ſundry times,</hi> proceed in Revealing his Will to Mankind; and why he did not at the firſt Communicate his Will to them as fully, and perfectly, as he did <hi>in the laſt days by his Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Under the Fourth,</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſhew the Perfection of the Goſpel-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, and that there is not to be any other Revelation till the End cometh when our <hi>Lord ſhall be revealed from heaven,</hi> and ſhall <hi>deliver up the kingdom to the Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have choſen thus at once to lay in Order the Scheme of what I intend (God granting Life and Aſſiſtance) to purſue; that ſo the depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62586:8"/>
of one upon another, and the aſſiſtance each Point gives to the other throughout the whole, might be the better obſerved.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I am to begin with Revelation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Where I am to conſider, What we mean by Revelation; which is nothing elſe in the firſt Notion, but the making known that which before was a ſecret; ſo things <hi>revealed</hi> and <hi>ſecret,</hi> are oppoſed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 29.</p>
            <p>And when it's applied to a Religious uſe, it's God's making known Himſelf, or his Will, to Mankind, over and above what he has made known by the Light of Nature and Reaſon.</p>
            <p>Here we may obſerve, that there are Three Claſſes, into which whatever is the Object of our Knowledge may be reduced.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There are things of pure and ſimple Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and knowable by the Light of it, without Revelation; of this kind is the Knowledge of God by the Effects of a Divine Power and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the world (as has been ſhewed) of which the Apoſtle treats, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. <hi>The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible things of him, from the creation of the world are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternal Power and Godhead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. There are things of pure and ſimple Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, that are not knowable by the Light of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62586:8"/>
Nature, but only by Revelation; and if not Revealed, are never in this ſtate (at leaſt) to be known or found out by Mankind; of this ſort is the Salvation of the World by Jeſus Chriſt, which was not diſcoverable by Men or Angels; ſo the Apoſtle deſcribes the Myſtery of it, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 9, 10. <hi>Which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God,—to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places, might be known by the Church the manifold Wiſdom of God.</hi> So 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There are things partly of Nature, and partly of Revelation, diſcoverable by the Light of Nature, but imperfectly, which we <hi>ſee,</hi> as it were, <hi>through a glaſs darkly;</hi> and ſo they need Revelation to give them farther Proof and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; of this the Apoſtle gives an inſtance, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 10. when he ſaith our Saviour <hi>brought life and immortality to light through the Goſpel,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, making it as evident as the Light; whereas before it was rather wiſhed for, than cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, as was the caſe of the Heathens; or much involv'd in Types, as among the <hi>Jews, Heb.</hi> 4. 3, &amp;c. So that Revelation, of which ſort ſoever it is, is Supernatural, and is only from God.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:62586:9"/>
2. I ſhall ſhew the Poſſibility of a Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that Almighty God, if he ſo pleaſes, can ſo Reveal himſelf to the Creature, that the Creature ſhall certainly and evidently know that the Revelation comes from God.</p>
            <p>This one would reaſonably think ſhould need no proof; and I ſhall therefore briefly touch upon it, tha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> I may proceed to the Third, which I principally intend to make the Subject of this preſent Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>I ſay it's poſſible for God to Reveal himſelf to his Creatures.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Why ſhould this be queſtioned, when we every day ſee men mutually diſcover their Minds each to other; and by the uſe and direction of certain Organical Powers, ſignify their Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Deſires, and Commands? And why may not the Creator Reveal his Will to the Creature, when one Creature thus can do it to another?</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Why ſhould this be queſtioned, when we may be certain Evidences know that a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is ſent from God? And then certainly the perſon that produces ſuch Evidences as are to the ſatisfaction of others, may himſelf be ſatisfied of the truth of his own Commiſſion, and the certainty of a Divine Revelation. The former, that others may be ſatisfied concerning a Miſſion
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62586:9"/>
from God, is evident from ſuch things declared, which none but God could Reveal, as Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; and ſuch things done, which none but God, in man, could do, as Miracles. Where theſe are, they are as evident Proofs of a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and Miſſion from God, as the works of Creation are a Proof a Divine Agent. The works of Creation prove a God, becauſe they are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of ſuch an Infinite Cauſe, and what none but ſuch a Cauſe could produce: And when ſuch things are diſcovered, which none but an Omniſcient Being could diſcover, and ſuch things done, which none but an Almighty Power could do; we are, by a Parity of Reaſon, as ſure that there is ſuch a Revelation by which ſuch things are made known, and in confirmation of which ſuch mighty Works are done.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) If this be queſtioned, it muſt be from a deficiency in God to impart ſuch a Revelation to man; or that there is an incapacity in man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. But how can God's Power herein be queſtioned that he can Operate thus on the Soul, when he both Created it, and is thoroughly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with all the ſecret ſprings of Motion, all the tendencies and inclinations, all the thoughts and deſires of it, and conſequently muſt be ſuppoſed to have a Power of directing it as he
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62586:10"/>
pleaſes? And how can there be any incapacity in man, when as to the matter he can both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, and deliver it as he received; and as to the manner, it's in a way ſuitable to his Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and is therefore call'd here, God's <hi>ſpeaking</hi> to the Prophets, which is ſo as the other may underſtand.</p>
            <p>This is a matter ſo evident, that it has been generally believed throughout the world among the Heathens; and therefore nothing more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon than to have Oracles, Places where they were wont to conſult their Deities, as well as the <hi>Jews</hi> had theirs: A Subject I am not at preſent concerned in, but it's ſufficient to ſhew what has been the ſenſe of all Ages in this caſe: And which even thoſe that would call this in queſtion, in part conſent to, while they grant ſomewhat equivalent to it, if not a branch of it, I mean Prophecy; which when it falls not within the Power of any Natural Cauſes, is the product of what is Supernatural, and what the Prophet muſt then receive from a higher hand, God.</p>
            <p>Grant this, and the whole will follow; for if it be poſſible in one caſe, it's poſſible in all, to one and the ſame Infinite Power.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:62586:10"/>
3. I am to Conſider the Expedience, Uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Neceſſity of a Revelation; for that is here ſuppoſed, when it's ſaid, <hi>God ſpake in time paſt,</hi> and <hi>in theſe laſt days;</hi> that is, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world to that time.</p>
            <p>Now Revelation is a means extraordinary (as has been ſhewed) and conſequently ſuch as the means are, ſuch muſt the caſe be, extraordinary; for God, not doing any thing in vain, cannot be ſuppoſed to uſe extraordinary means, where the caſe is ordinary, and may as well be ſerved by ordinary means. Thus it is in Miracles, which are acts above the common ſtandard of Nature, and are then only exerted, when nothing leſs will engage the Attention of Faith of Mankind. And ſo it is in Revelation, which is to the Light of Reaſon, what Miracles are to the common Law of Nature, Supernatural and Extraordinary; and conſequently where Almighty God takes that courſe for the Information of Mankind, it ſhews that there is ſome deficiency or corruption that calls for it, and makes it expedient and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. As it was with <hi>Adam</hi> at his firſt Creation, who being an utter ſtranger to himſelf, and the world he was at once brought into, without ſome further kind of Information, inſtead of a pleaſure he might have taken in viewing the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62586:11"/>
Fabrick of the Heavens, and the variety of Creatures in the Earth, muſt have been full of Amazement and Confuſion. For in ſo wide a Scene as was before him, Where muſt he begin, or where could he hope to end? How divided muſt he be in his own Mind? What a cold and dry Speculation would it have been, if he had hit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, to have concluded, with that Modern Philoſopher, <hi>Cogito, ergo ſum; I think, therefore I am?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He indeed felt himſelf to be, but how he came to be, he knew not; for he ſaw nothing about him that could either be ſuppoſed to have given him that Being, or could tell him how he came by it. He ſaw he had a Body, and a Body that obſequiouſly moved as he pleaſed to direct and determine; but what that Body was originally made of, he could not poſſibly tell: For how could he ſuppoſe ſuch warm, ſoft, and tender Fleſh, thoſe firm and well compacted Joynts, thoſe radiant and ſparkling Eyes (which he had as other living Creatures) that moveable and limber, and well-complexioned matter of which his Body conſiſted, ſhould be formed out of cold, moveleſs, crumbling, and ſhapeleſs Earth?</p>
            <p>He felt his Body move, and pliable in all its motions to his Will, and quick as Thought to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62586:11"/>
his Mind, but what that inward Principle was that moved it, he was wholly ignorant; nor could he poſſibly, of himſelf at that inſtant, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that there was an inward Immaterial Spirit that was vitally United to a Groſs and Material Body, that was the Principle of all, and was as diſtinct from the Body in it's Nature and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, as if it were not United at all to it. He might obſerve the Creatures about him of different ſorts, that there were certain Notes that each Kind had, and all were known and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood among themſelves; but that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were all dumb to him, and he to them; and what it was that made the difference, he could not underſtand. When he pleaſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Contemplation of the Heavens above, and that glorious Luminary that gave (as he perceived) Light to all about him; he could not tell whether it was an intelligent Being, and that as it gave Light to all, ſo it was Superior to them: And when that ſet, he knew not but he was to be incloſed in perpetual Darkneſs. When a heavy Stupidneſs began to ſeize himſelf, and he was forced to ſubmit to the power of it, he knew not but it was to end that Life, which was that day began, and that he was to cloſe his Eyes, and conclude his Life together.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:62586:12"/>
So that though he had what we call Reaſon, and ſuppoſe it as his Body, in its prime; yet even that Reaſon muſt have been his Torment for a while; when it made him inquiſitive, but could not give him ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>To prevent which diſorder and confuſion he would otherwiſe be in, at the firſt opening of his Eyes and his Mind together, as it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that he that was to begin the world, ſhould be Created in a full Age and Strength; and that he that was alone, ſhould have a preſent power and faculty of Elocution and forming of Words for the Converſation he was to have with the <hi>Help</hi> deſigned for him; ſo it was requiſite that he ſhould have ſome immediate Inſpiration, to inform him of what was neceſſary for him to know as to God, himſelf, and the World; and which he could not have known without ſuch Inſpiration, or the ſlow and tedious compaſs of Obſervation; and ſo muſt have waited for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction till time and experience had formed his Judgment, and made him a wiſe Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher.</p>
            <p>But this <hi>Adam</hi> was at the firſt, and ſo forthwith knew whom it was that he was to own as the Author of his Being, and of what his Body was made, and by what means an Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62586:12"/>
Spirit came to be incloſed in a Material Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and could as ſoon reſolve all thoſe perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doubts, which otherwiſe he would have been aſſaulted with, as he underſtood at firſt ſight that <hi>Eve was bone of his bone;</hi> and knew how to give Names to the Creatures ſuitable to their Natures, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 19, 23.</p>
            <p>But now the reaſons for ſuch an Inſpiration to <hi>Adam</hi> were perſonal, belonging to him alone; but after what manner the Divine Wiſdom would have imparted the Knowledge of it ſelf to <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poſterity, if he and they had ſtood and continued in a ſtate of Primogenial Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency; or whether there would, in thoſe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, have been any need of a Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Inſpiration after the Revelation made to <hi>Adam,</hi> from whom they might have Infallibly received it; no more concerns us, than it doth to know how Mankind would then have been diſpoſed of when they were not to Dye, but to have ſubſiſted in the ſame State, Body and Soul inſeparably United: Thoſe are among the <hi>ſecret things which belong unto God;</hi> but <hi>things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed belong unto us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We muſt therefore alter the Scene, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider Mankind in a State of Imperfection and Depravation; and there we ſhall find Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62586:13"/>
abſolutely neceſſary as a remedy againſt a fourfold Miſchief, which, without it, would unavoidably enſue; As with reſpect to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion <hi>Adam</hi> was in by reaſon of Guilt; The Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger he was in from his Enemy, The Subtile and Malicious Serpent; The Ruin that threatned him from the impotency and diſorder he found in his Faculties; which like a Diſlocation in the Limbs, though fit in themſelves for Action, yet being removed out of their Sockets are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of diſcharging their Functions.</p>
            <p>This being the State of Fallen Man, there was need of a Supervenient Revelation to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him, as well as it was the determination of the Divine Goodneſs to deſign it.</p>
            <p>There was need of this to comfort him under the ſenſe of his Apoſtacy and the Guilt he had contracted, to prevent his Deſpair: To fortify him againſt the power of his inſolent and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant Adverſary, and to aid him under his contracted diſability, for preventing his Diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement: And to caution him againſt the ſad effects of his Depravation, or the falling into a repetition of a new diſobedience, for preventing his Preſumption.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:62586:13"/>
For theſe Reaſons Almighty God ſo ſoon inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the Garden by a new Revelation of Himſelf, and Inſtructed him in his gracious deſign to reſtore him to Favour, and in the method he would obſerve for that purpoſe, inwhat he ſaith to the Serpent, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy ſeed and her ſeed: it ſhall bruiſe thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the Goſpel was Preached to <hi>Adam,</hi> who was the firſt Prophet to whom the Myſtery of Salvation was revealed; to which thoſe places in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> ſeem to refer, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 70. <hi>As he ſpake by the mouth of his holy Prophets ſince the world began;</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, from the beginning, ſo <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 21.</p>
            <p>This was the caſe of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the exigence he would have been in, without this immediate and comfortable Revelation.</p>
            <p>And the Condition of his Poſterity would have been worſe than his, without a Revelation; had this Revelation died with this their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitor, and not have been tranſmitted to them.</p>
            <p>For beſides the ſtate of Guilt, which muſt equally have invaded them as it did him, and what Conſcience in them could no more quietly digeſt, than in him; there were ſeveral diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62586:14"/>
they laboured under, which he did not.</p>
            <p>As if we conſider <hi>Adam</hi> in a bare State of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (without any Supernatural proviſion) he had this advantage above his Poſterity, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Created in a full Age, he was free from all prepoſſeſſions of Senſe or Education; and in the firſt moment of his Being, had his Reaſon clear in the fountain of it, like the Sun in its Meridian Glory; and all his Faculties bright, and as ripe at once for Obſervation and Reflection, as his Body was for Action.</p>
            <p>But his Poſterity growing up from their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy among ſenſible Objects, from thence would (in a meer courſe of Nature) have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived all their Information; and by ſlow de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees from things Viſible, muſt have argued themſelves into the Belief of things Inviſible; and from the Effects of a Supreme Cauſe, to the Supreme Cauſe it ſelf; which in the Apoſtle's Words, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 27. would be to <hi>ſeek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him,</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as men blundering in the dark] <hi>and find him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſuch danger would the fundamental Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Natural Religion have been, if there had been no Revelation to prevent it: And this was the reaſon of ſuch a proviſion by Inſpired Perſons, to preſerve thoſe Principles alive and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62586:14"/>
ſafe; of the number of whom <hi>Abel</hi> is accounted, and therefore called a Prophet, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 50. and <hi>Enoch, Jude</hi> 14. and <hi>Noah</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5.</p>
            <p>But now as the Rays of the Sun, the farther they are projected, grow weaker and weaker; ſo it was in the derivation of theſe Principles, which loſt very much of their primitive luſtre; and notwithſtanding the certainty of the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the credibility and authority of thoſe Holy Patriarchs; Vice, like a deluge, broke in upon the world, ſo that <hi>every imagination of the thoughts of their hearts</hi> (generally ſpeaking) <hi>was only evil continually,</hi> Gen. 6. 5.</p>
            <p>And if now when there was a Revelation, and a Revelation ſeconded by the Authority of ſuch Eminent Perſons, the World ſo ſoon grew Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, What would it not have been, if there had been no ſuch Revelation, or no ſuch Cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of it?</p>
            <p>And this the World was ſoon ſenſible of after the Flood; for notwithſtanding ſo late and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing an inſtance of the Divine Vengeance, yet in their ſeveral Diſperſions, for want of a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, they loſt the ſenſe of the true and great Principles of Religion; ſome, as the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> turning it into a vain Inquiry into the Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Heavenly Bodies; others placing
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62586:15"/>
their Religion in ridiculous and opprobrious Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions, as the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> others pleaſing themſelves in nice Diſputations, and the Vanity of new-diſcovered Deities and Religions, as the <hi>Greeks:</hi> And all acting in Divine matters, as if they were in inextricable Labyrinths, being diſtracted, and eternally divided about the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine of the World, whether it were Eternal, or Accidental, or the Product of a Divine Power; about the Origine of Evil; about the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World, whether it be by different Deities, Good or Evil; or whether by none, but be wholly Acted by the levity of Chance, or the immutable Law of Deſtiny and Fate.</p>
            <p>So that in proceſs of time the World was brought into the condition of <hi>Elymas, Acts</hi> 13. 8, 11. that once had the advantage and pleaſure of Sight, but upon the oppoſition made to St. <hi>Paul, immediately there fell on him a miſt and a darkneſs, that he went about ſeeking ſome to lead him by the hand.</hi> Too cloſe a Repreſentation of the condition of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in that Degenerate State, who becauſe that <hi>when they knew God, they glorified him not as God—but became vain in their imaginations; their fooliſh heart was darkned,</hi> Rom. 1. 21. Of which darkneſs and confuſion in matters of the greateſt importance, the World, the Commonalty as well as the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62586:15"/>
part of Mankind, was ſenſible, and of the neceſſity of a Revelation, or ſomewhat beyond Nature, Reaſon and Argumentation, to remove theſe difficulties, to inform them of what they could not otherwiſe know, and to clear up to them what they did know but imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly.</p>
            <p>Of which I ſhall offer ſome undeniable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They univerſally complained of the loſs they were at, and of the inſufficiency of all their Maxims and Principles, of all their Enquiries and Speculations, to give them any tolerable ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; ſo that they were in nothing more divided, than about what Happineſs is, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> from <hi>Varro</hi> has ſhew'd: And therefore there was ſomewhat further neceſſary to ſatisfy them, or elſe they muſt for ever remain unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There was nothing more deſired than a Revelation, and therefore they were prone to hearken to all pretences to it; and when they conceived, or were made to believe it was a Revelation, they were in nothing more obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quious and pliable. So that to gain Authority to his Laws, and to keep the People Quiet and Orderly, <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> did then (as <hi>Mahomet</hi> of

latter years) pretend he had all by Revelation from the Nymph <hi>Egeria.</hi> And of ſuch Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was this pretence, that as <hi>Tully</hi> ſaith, <hi>There was nothing ſo abſurd which was not maintained by ſome of the Philoſophers;</hi> ſo I may ſay, There was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo fooliſh, or wicked, which was not an ingredient in the Worſhip they gave to their Deities. Inſomuch, as the nature of things ſhould be perverted, Reaſon and Humanity ſhould be abandoned, and God himſelf be made worſe than thoſe that Worſhipped him, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with their pretended Revelations. What Beaſtiality and Lewdneſs! what Savage and Barbarous Practices and Rites were allowed and required! The Blood of Captives, and of their own Children, muſt be a Libation; nay, even Suicide was not only Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but a Religious Martyrdome, if the Oracle commanded it; and they choſe rather to be unnatural to the higheſt degree, than not to be Obedient to Divine Revelation. Now of what authority muſt that be, which ſhould over-rule the Laws of Nature, and ſo infatuate Mankind, that they ſhould not be able to eſpy the Impoſture? And what could thus impoſe upon them, if they were not ſenſible of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect ſtate they were in, and the need they
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62586:16"/>
ſtood in of ſome higher Principle and, greater Light to direct them, than that of Nature?</p>
            <p n="3">3. There was no Nation without a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, that is, without ſome pretence to it, and which they generally vouched for their Rites and Religious Obſervances; from whence it was that there was ſcarcely a People of any note in the more Civilized parts of the World that had not their Sibyls, ſuch as were accounted to be the mouth of their God; to be ſure none in any part of the known world without an Oracle, that they repaired to, and whoſe Injunctions they readily Obeyed. The uſe I make of all this is to ſhow, what a ſenſe Mankind had of a Revelation, and what all the World has thought Expedient, if not Neceſſary, which was the thing to be proved.</p>
            <p>From what has been ſaid, we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">I. What a Happineſs it is to have a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, by which Mankind are <hi>brought out of darkneſs into a marvellous light;</hi> and from an endleſs and fruitleſs Enquiry, <hi>Who will ſhew us my good?</hi> are placed in a quiet and full poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of it. If there be no Revelation, we
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62586:17"/>
are, as it were, <hi>with ut God in the world;</hi> and know not whether that Divine Power be our Friend or our Enemy; or whether it ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted to our Good or our Ruine. If there be no Revelation, <hi>we are ſtill in our ſins,</hi> and have no Sanctuary againſt the accuſation of our own em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bittered Conſciences, the fears of our own guilty Minds, or the Juſtice of an incenſed Deity. If there be no Revelation, we have <hi>no hope,</hi> and can have no comfort in our Death, and no aſſurance of Immortality after it. If there be no Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we are in a perpetual maze, as if we were at Sea without Star or Compaſs, and knew not what courſe to take to gain our Harbour. So thoughtful and penſive, ſo confounded and loſt is Mankind without this, that if I were to chuſe whether I would have no Revelation, or a falſe one, for the quiet of my own mind (did I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the falſe one to be true) I would rather chuſe the content of the latter, than the diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the former, and leave it to my own reaſon to rectify the manifeſt miſtakes in it, rather than have my hovering Reaſon to be my conſtant af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction under the want of Revelation.</p>
            <p>But Bleſſed be God that there is no cauſe for ſuch a ſuppoſition, and that we have all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the world to believe there is a Revelation;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62586:17"/>
a Revelation that is ſuch as all Mankind would deſire, that touches upon all points neceſſary to our comfort and entire ſatisfaction, as to the Nature and Will of God, the Preſent and Future State of Mankind, the Providence that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns this World, and the Rewards of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. A Revelation, where all the parts of it agree together, and bear a conformity to the Nature of things, to the Holineſs, Juſtice, and Mercy of God, and to the Reaſon of Mankind; where there is a Syſtem of the beſt Principles, and a Scheme of the beſt Rules and Directions; and which, like the Book of Nature, the more it's viewed and conſulted, the more do the lively Characters of a Divine Hand and Wiſdom ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the Compoſure.</p>
            <p>A Character this is that the Book of Scripture exactly anſwers. For what holy Precepts! what heavenly Promiſes! what uſeful Examples! what excellent Encouragements do the Sacred Pages abound in! Such as are ſufficient to direct us in every point of our Duty, to inform us in every neceſſary Truth, to eſtabliſh our Hearts in every condition of Life, to enable us to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter all the difficulties of it with Reſolution, and to bear all the evil of it with Patience. Here behold God Reconciled to Mankind, the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62586:18"/>
trembling Sinner Pardoned, the Weak ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Doubtful ſatisfied, and nothing wanting on God's part to make us Happy, if we are not wanting in a fit diſpoſition of Mind to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it.</p>
            <p>So that if there be any Revelation, it is the Chriſtian; if that be not a Revelation from God, there is no Revelation in the World; And if that be a Revelation, that only is ſo, and there can be no other.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Such as the Revelation is, ſuch is the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation; the Authority it receives from God, the Obligation lies upon us to Obey as well as Believe it. <hi>The times of ignorance God winked at,</hi> and overlook'd; <hi>but now he commandeth all men every where to repent,</hi> Acts 17. 30<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He hath <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi> them by a Revelation, which is of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal concernment, and extends its Authority over the World. So that a Bad man is no better or ſafer for a Revelation, how perfect ſoever it be, and how great ſoever the advantages of it are, than he that is without Revelation; nay, ſo much the worſe, as the latter is a ſtate of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, the former of Diſobedience; this errs without his will, but the other with it. And therefore if the Heathens, who had only the Book of Nature to read, and a blundering Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62586:18"/>
for their Guide, were yet ſo far inexcuſable, becauſe that <hi>when they knew God, they glorified him not as God,</hi> Rom. 2. 21. <hi>How ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great Salvation? which at the firſt was ſpoken by the Lord, and was confirmed by thoſe that heard him; God alſo bearing them witneſs, &amp;c. Heb.</hi> 2. 3, 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What remains then, but ſince</hi> the Grace of God, <hi>in the Revelation of the</hi> Goſpel, hath appeared unto all men, <hi>that we be thereby taught to</hi> deny ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and worldly luſts, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godlily in this preſent world. <hi>And then we may comfortably</hi> look for that bleſſed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie unto himſelf a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar people, zealous of good works, <hi>Tit. 2. 11.</hi>
