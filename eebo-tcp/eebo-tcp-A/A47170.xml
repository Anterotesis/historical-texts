            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>COMING not long ſince into a Coffee-houſe, I hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to ſeat my ſelf at a Table with three or four that were very eager in Diſcourſe, and I ſoon

found you was the Subject. One that pretended to have read your Books, and had enjoy'd ſome of your Converſation, would not be perſuaded but that the glimps of Knavery was eaſily diſcoverable through your Fool's Dreſs, and that there lay ſome bad Deſign lurking at the bottom; whilſt another thought it was too natural to be a Diſguiſe, and that you had no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for a Mask to act that part: a third, to reconcile the other two, would needs have you a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound of both. Theſe Comments drew from me my Opinion, which was, That you had too much Learning for a <hi>Fool,</hi> and too little Wit for a <hi>Knave,</hi> but was ſtark ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Mad, had got off your Shac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles, and deſerted the <hi>College.</hi> And to this, upon mature deliberation,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:32776:3"/>
they ſeem'd to aſſent, and very af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately began to pity your Condition. What thanks I ſhall have for my pains, I know not, I doubt but little; eſpecially ſhould you chance to be of the ſame mind with one not long ſince try'd for Murder, who when ſome of his Friends would have inſinuated to the Court, that he was <hi>non compos mentis,</hi> in order to ſave him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted it, and was very angry at the Reproach; he ſtood upon Rep— and would rather be hang'd than be thought a Mad man (I'm ſure had I been one of his Jury, I ſhould have found him ſo) and if you are in the ſame Caſe with that Gentleman, (notwithſtanding all your Invectives againſt the Party) you'l be found a rank <hi>Antinomian,</hi> for you will be out of the reach of the Law.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:32776:4"/>And now I'm mentioning the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> by the way I cannot but give you a hint of your horrid Character of Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi> (whoſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory deſerves reſpect for his Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety) and your abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ridicule of the Work of Converſion,<note rend="inter">Second New Year's Gift, <hi>p. 14.</hi> and ſo on.</note> in <hi>Salem Ben Sholomoh</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> in ſuch fulſom Language, that he that has the largeſt extent of Charity, can hardly judg you to have undergone the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

            <p>I remember ſome time ſince, when Mr. <hi>Jacobs</hi> ſaid, <hi>The Baptiſts went down into the Water with the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men only to feel 'em,</hi> &amp;c. your Spirit was very warm, and you mighty zealous in upbraiding him for it, and could ſay, (nay, and print it too) <hi>none but a Debauchee would have been guilty of ſuch ſtuff</hi>: ſo that your laſt Book calls you Debauchee to your Face, and we dare believe it in that, tho not in many things elſe.</p>
            <p>I could not have expected from a Man of your Years (and a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:32776:6"/>
Copulative too) ſuch things as are charg'd upon you, had I not heard that your Wife (and in that ſhe's a happy Woman) muſt lie alone (and has done ever ſince her Reign ended, and your Tyranny began) you having ſomething to teach the young Men in Bed.</p>
            <p>Either Phyſicians are in the wrong, when they ſay 'tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholſom, or ſome People don't do well to adviſe the young Men to <hi>lie upon their Backs, with their hands by their Sides,</hi> whilſt they read Lectures upon ſome of the outer parts, and ſet the poor things a gog (by their negative Advice) after what they might happily o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe not think of; but I hope they have wit enough to conſider who they make their Confeſſor.

            </p>
            <p>In ſhort, <hi>Sir,</hi> there are ſome things buz'd abroad concerning you that are almoſt incredible, and hardly to be imagin'd ſhould be done by ſuch a one as you would be thought, or indeed by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that had not laid a <hi>Cauſtick</hi> to his Conſcience, or gotten the <hi>Fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flap of Formality</hi> to keep away the <hi>Flies</hi> from ſtinging it. What Man but your ſelf ever had the Face, or could be imagin'd impudent enough to appear in the World againſt the pretended immodeſty of an Ordinance (as you have done) unleſs he could wipe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf clean from ſuch Reflections as have oft and again been caſt

upon you <hi>Sir Flog-well,</hi> and ſtill ſtick cloſe to you? Good <hi>Peda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue,</hi> you can never pretend your <hi>Diſcipline</hi> (as you call it) is for the Correction of your Scholars, but rather calculated for the Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of your own Diverſion; for what Puniſhment is there in the ſtroak of a Feather, or why ſhould you ring the Bells, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. upon the Boys Bums? Prithee, why ſo many at once? one ſuch Object is enough at a time; ſo many, one would think, ſhould diſtract your <hi>weak Opticks,</hi> and make you as wild in your <hi>Senſes,</hi> as you are in your <hi>Underſtanding.</hi> And indeed, <hi>Sir,</hi> I cannot forbear finding fault with your Method as well as your Manners, and cenſuring your Prudence as well as your Modeſty (I don't ſay Chaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity)
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:32776:7"/>
'Tis highly reaſonable to think, that young Men of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or thirty years of Age, ſhould better be wrought upon by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion, than <hi>Bum-bruſhing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But remembring you are a mighty lover of Stories and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes (which, as they are ſurreptiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſcrap'd up here and there, are as odly jumbled together, and profuſely and blunderingly flung away, without Deſign, and to no end in your Books) be pleas'd kindly to accept of ſuch as may chance to drop from my Pen.</p>
            <p>A certain Apothecary ſends his Man to adminiſter a Clyſter, that was preſcrib'd by a Phyſician, for a Gentleman his Patient, who was ſorely afflicted with the Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach; the man enters the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:32776:8"/>
Chamber, who demands <hi>Who's there?</hi> anſwer is made, <hi>the Apothecary. What has the Doctor or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd me?</hi> A Clyſter, <hi>A Clyſter</hi>! quoth the Gentleman, you Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, you Raſcal, the Doctor's a Fool to ſend a thing to put in my A— to cure my Head, and ſo drove him out of the Room. What Lines of Communication you have found out between the Head and Tail of a Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, I know not; but it ſeems very prepoſterous to ſuppoſe, that diminiſhing the <hi>podicical Covering,</hi> ſhould increaſe the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I doubt Birch-Clyſters don't work kindly: A Patient's Fancy does very much aſſiſt the Doctor's endeavours; and therefore I doubt you have but little ſucceſs in your Practice, becauſe your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:32776:8"/>
cannot be perſuaded into a good Opinion of their Phyſick, for they have a natural averſion to pain. I find you are one of <hi>Co—atch</hi>'s followers, your <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines</hi> are all <hi>Acids.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, <hi>Sir,</hi> having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered your Caſe, I find <hi>Diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> the beſt excuſe I can make to my ſelf and others, for theſe enormous excurſions of your <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intellectuals</hi>; which makes me a little commiſerate your Caſe, and heartily adviſe you in your very next <hi>interval,</hi> to read Dr. <hi>Echard's</hi> Letter to the Author of <hi>Hierago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſticon,</hi> and uſe his Preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; they exactly hit your Caſe; pray don't neglect it, delays be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dangerous: He ſays you muſt avoid all hot things, as <hi>Coffee</hi> and <hi>Tobacco</hi> (and I believe not without
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:32776:9"/>
reaſon, for they are apt to dry up the Brain, and when things are too dry they will crack) but above all you muſt avoid wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Books, till you find the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper pretty well aſſwag'd, and then too but moderately, for fear of a Relapſe. But if you can't forbear till then, pray what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you write in your fit (which is but all you write) read over in an interval before it goes to the Preſs, and then I doubt not they will all receive their fate as truly (tho not as duly) as if they were burnt by the hands of the common Hangman.</p>
            <p>Indeed ſome of thoſe already publiſh'd have anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the end propos'd,<note rend="inter">

            <p>You ſeem in all your Writings to drive very hard for the <hi>Buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi>; but, I muſt tell you, they are too noble an Ornament to adorn your <hi>Farce</hi>; for what you write is as much below that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Author, as a <hi>Bartholomew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair Droll</hi> is below <hi>Seneca</hi>'s <hi>Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:32776:10"/>I muſt acknowledg you have hammer'd hard for a little Wit to divert the World, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the World's very ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful it won't accept the <hi>Will</hi> for the <hi>Deed</hi>; and 'tis really very hard that you ſhould print Books at your own Charge, and be at the Expence both of <hi>Purſe</hi> and <hi>Brain</hi> to pleaſe, and <hi>all in vain</hi>: yet you have this comfortable Solace in the experience you have gain'd, you have found out the beſt way of putting off your Books of any Man in <hi>England.</hi> I am told, that when you was, not long ſince, <hi>chewing the Cud, without dividing the Hoof, in</hi> Noah'<hi>s Ark</hi> (as you call it) you was telling a Story of a Man that cry'd Pears, twelve, ſixteen, twenty a Penny, and none would buy, till at laſt he
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:32776:10"/>
cry'd <hi>Pears for nothing,</hi> and then he ſoon empty'd his Basket; ſo (ſaid you) is it with my Books. Why <hi>Sam</hi>! what an unhappy Fellow art thou to lay the Rod in the way thus? For who, do you think, won't reply, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the <hi>Pears</hi> would not ſell, was, becauſe <hi>they were not good?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I remember a Paſſage I once met with in a Dramatick Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em call'd, <hi>The Folly of Prieſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>craft.</hi> Father <hi>Politico</hi> (who bears the Character of a plotting, intrigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prieſt) orders his Man <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel</hi> to read the Intelligences which he had receiv'd out of the Country, what Men there were in the ſeveral Counties that were fit <hi>Tools</hi> to work with, in building up the <hi>Catholick</hi> Cauſe;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:32776:11"/>
and among the reſt, <hi>There is a Fellow of a broad Face, and no Brains, the want of which is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd by a great ſtock of Impudence, which enables him to rail againſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery in</hi> Billingſgate <hi>Language, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out two grains of Senſe or Reaſon— He gets a good quantity of Money in the Year, and preaches in a little Shed at the end of his Houſe. Then mark him down</hi> (<hi>ſays</hi> Politico) <hi>and ſend an hundred Pounds to make his Shed bigger; there are more converted to us by hearing bad Sermons againſt Popery, than by hearing good ones for it.</hi> Whether this is worthy the Conſideration of your Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſts, muſt be left to them, and how far the Story reacheth their Caſe. But I am very apt to think, ſhould they be at the Charge of printing all you write
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:32776:11"/>
(rather than you ſhould be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent) it would prove for the good of the Cauſe you oppoſe; and one of your Books againſt any Opinion, will make more <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts</hi> to it, than ten good Books writ for it.</p>
            <p>I find, old <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> you are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to keep us in uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to what Party you belong, and make us think you are a Man of no Religion, by your quarrelling with all as wrong. I did believe you a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> (if any thing) till I met with thoſe ſcurrilous Sarcaſms upon the two great Men of the Age of that Perſuaſion,<note rend="inter">

(you know the old ſaying, <hi>De mortuis nil niſi bonum</hi>) but 'tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable to ſtamp 'em with Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities. I can find no truth in what you would inſinuate, tho I have often endeavour'd it, and can make no ſhift to free it from the name of a <hi>Lie,</hi> but that it is too groſs to deceive. And I doubt not but you thought your ſelf a fitter Man to ſpeak to the King, in the name of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, than he that did it (whom the World knows to be a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Man, and needs no Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium from any but his own Works) as you have often im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely ſeem'd to aſſert.

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:32776:12"/>
on the <hi>Liberty</hi> given to <hi>Madmen,</hi> as he muſt have judg'd them by their Repreſentative.</p>
            <p>You needed not to have taken the trouble to acknowledg your ſelf <hi>a Man of but little Prudence,</hi> as you do in the thirty ſecond page of your <hi>ſecond New-Years-Gift,</hi> for I never yet could meet with the Man thought you had any.</p>
