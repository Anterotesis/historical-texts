         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ioyned you all together in one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,
when euery one of you
seuerally are worthy of a better
gift then here is exhibited, or by
me can be giuen; yet herein I haue
done no more then nature, brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affection, and Christianity hath
done. That I haue clothed this in the liuery of your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronages,
I might haue giuen many reasons: First, for
that you are louers of true religion, and fauourers of all
true professors. Secondly, because it was preached at the
interring of your deere brother. Thirdly, because I had
rtaher the whole world shold condemne me as vniust, &amp;
the curious and captious carpe at me, then you should
so much as thinke me vnthankfull. I owe vnto you all a
double debt, of <hi>Loue,</hi> and of <hi>Seruice.</hi> Of loue, the
more I pay, the more I owe; though a debt once paid, be
<pb facs="tcp:15583:3"/>
no more due, yet loue being paid, is still due. Seruice I
will bee ready to pay to the vttermost, though it come
short of your great deserts, and of my manifold desires: I
that yeeld to all in learning, will yeeld to none in loue
and seruice to you. But to you right worshipful and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Patron, I owe a treble debt, of Loue, of Seruice, and
Thankfulnesse: Of loue, for your extraordinary kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in preferring me, and for that countenance you
haue continually giuen to my weake Ministerie: Of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
such as I can performe, I will not faile; daily besee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
God for the increase of his spirituall graces here,

               </gap>ere vnto you. Of thankfulnesse, in patronizing
me being absent, kindly entreating me present, and for
affecting me long before I was by you preferred. Of some
I shall be hardly censured, of others thought ambitious in
seeking mens fauours. For this I care not, so the well-affected
Christian may think of the shortnesse of his life,
and thereby prepare to dye; and being ready, to bee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to dye, and you be pleasd to procure a quiet passage
vnder your patronages for those few indigested medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which were by Gods permission, and his assisting
Spirit, first preached, and now published: I ascribe the
patronage to you, the vse to the godly, and the successe to
God. The God of peace giue you the peace of God which
passeth all humane vnderstanding, and affoord you ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
comforts and ioyes in this life to the end, and in the

               <hi>Great are the troubles of the righteous, Psa.</hi> 34. 19. Hee
doth often complaine of his troubles, and that with
great griefe and bitternesse of minde, and chiefly in
this place. This Psalme is partly narratiue, partly
<pb facs="tcp:15583:4"/>
precatiue: In the first part <hi>Dauid</hi> declareth how hee
had purposed with himselfe to take need of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring
against God, which might arise through the
iniuries of men. In the second part he desireth that
God would certifie him of the vanitie of this life,
and therefore he saith:<note place="margin">Psalme 39. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Lord let me know my <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

words doth not desire death, but he requesteth that
he may be brought to a serious consideration of his
mortality, as is euident by the words, <hi>Let me know
my end:</hi> that is, the end of my naturall life, of my
daies, which by thy decree I must liue in this world,
and then he saith; <hi>Behold, thou hast made my dayes as

thee: surely euery man in his best estate is altogether va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>

that the Lord hath made my dayes short;

the shortest measures, and the time of my life is as
nothing, or like to nothing; and surely euery man,
not onely such as are of base condition, but the

            <p>Seeing the life of man is but as an hand bredth,<note place="margin">Doctr.</note> it
affoordeth this doctrine, that mans life is short, and

to rest; by birth to sorrow, by death to ioy; by birth

Death is rather the flight of sinne, then the detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of man dying, because to the iust death is not
the end of nature, but of sinne, as a Father saith. To
leaue this world and inherite a better should seeme
nothing. Death is a passage from sinne and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to glory and immortality, from this earth to
heauen, from the company of sinners, to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Saints; from sorrow, to solace; from paine,
to peace; from sicknesse, to safety; from persecution,
to triumph; from the bondage of <hi>Pharoah,</hi> to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of the sons of God. The consideration heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

Eccl.</hi> 2. 11.<note place="margin">Eccles. 2. 11.</note> Seeing all things in the world are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
better is a good death then a bad life, and the

wee shall bee immortall: wee are aliue in the
wombe, to die in the world, but dead in the graue
to liue in heauen. Our life is not compared to an
ell or yard, to a pace or to a cubite, to a mile or to a
furlong, to a fathome or to a foote, but to an hand
bredth, a very short measure. <hi>Man that is borne of

This world is as a Stage, and man as an Actor, when
he hath plaid his part hee is gone. Our liues shorten
as if the booke of our daies were by the pen-knife of
Gods iudgement cut lesse. Before the Floud they
were in Folio, they liued almost a thousand yeares,
<hi>Methushelah</hi> liued nine hundred sixty and nine
yeares, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. 27.<note place="margin">Gen. 5. 27.</note> the whole chapter will shew vs
how long the men liued before the Floud. After the

<hi>Dauids</hi> time in Octauo, three score and foure score
yeares, but with vs in the daies of the Gospell, in
Decimo sexto in the least volume, now at forty, fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or sixty yeares, old men, and so we are dying al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
so soone as we beginne to liue. The Elements
are more mixed, drossie, and confused, our new sins
call for new plagues; the aire is more infected and
contagious, and our sinnes of drunkennesse and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting
do not want to second all the rest: we may
obserue that neither planers aboue, nor plants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
yeeld vs expected comfort. So God for our
sinnes doth cause the heauen to be as Brasse, and the
earth as Iron, and the aire with the winds to bee
tempestuous, and so almost euery thing which was
created for mans vse is become his enemy, and all
because wee turne all things to vices corruption,
which were giuen for natures protection: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:15583:8"/>
what wee haue diuerted to wickednesse, God
hath reuerted to our reuenge. Wee are sicke of
sinne, and therefore the world is sicke of vs. How
soone doth the sand runne downe in the houre-glasse,
how quickely doth the Sunne beginne to set?
so speedily doth our time passe away. Future things
are alwaies beginning, present things alwaies en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and things past are dead and gone; while wee
liue we die, and then we leaue dying, when we leaue
liuing: Better it is therefore to die to life, then to liue
to death, because our mortall life is nothing but a
liuing death, and life continually flyeth from vs and
cannot be with-held, and death hourely commeth
vpon vs and cannot be with-stood: No armour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth,
no threatning preuaileth, nor no entreaty
profiteth, against deaths assault. If all perils spare
our life, yet time and age in the end will consume it.
As a riuer that riseth in the Forrest passeth by many
rockes, runneth and tumbleth, and maketh a noise,
yet in the end entreth into the sea: so fareth it with
mans life, he commeth into the world with paine,
and beginneth his course with pittifull cries, and is
daily molested with sicknesses, and neuer ceaseth
running, till in the end he fall into the sea of death:
As euery man hath his <hi>Genesis,</hi> so hee must haue his
<hi>Exodus,</hi> and as we are borne to liue, so we are borne
to die. Our dying on earth is but the taking of our
iourney to heauen: Why are we vnwilling to loose
that, which cannot be kept? The good Pilot sitteth
at the sterne to guide his ship; and so a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
to direct his life must thinke on death: death is
the dore whereby we must go out of bondage, and
therefore as he that is in prison taketh great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb facs="tcp:15583:8"/>
to sit vpon the threshold, that when the doore is
opened, he may the sooner get out: so we must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
haue our mindes fixed vpon death, for passe
wee must, but how or when wee know not. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosinarius</hi>
hauing his Tombe in building, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
that it should bee left imperfect, and
that his seruants euery day should put him in minde
to finish the same, that so hee might prepare to
dye.</p>
            <p>The vse of this doctrine is,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> forasmuch as our life

We are all housholders, our bodies are our houses,
our soules our goods, our sences are the doores and
windowes, the lockes are faith and prayer. The day
of our death will come as a thiefe; a thiefe commeth
when men do not looke for him: so the day of death
commeth suddenly. A thiefe commeth not when

            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Reuel. 14. 13.</note> because our liues are short and sinfull,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>

thou hast ouercome me: so may death say to them,
O Christian thou hast ouercome me.<note place="margin">Vicisti Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne.</note> What is death
that thou fearest it? it is a departure from this wicked
world, a dissolution of the bodies of the godly from
bonds, that they may be with Christ; it is a returning
to our heauenly Countrey from this pilgrimage, it
is a deliuerance from the misery of the world, it is a
returne from banishment to our fathers house, it is a
preparation for the glory of the resurrection. Why
dost thou feare death? Death hath onely the name of
death, not the sting of death.<note place="margin">Numb. 21. 9.</note> As the brazen ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent

semblance of death, but it hath no sting, it hath no
venome, it hath no poyson. If a Bee sting a dead
carkasse, she looseth not her sting; but if she sting a
liuing man, she looseth her sting: so death stinging
vs which were as dead flesh, did not loose his sting;

when God, the Prince of Princes, calleth vs by
death into his priuy chamber of heauen. Therefore
let beasts, and heathen, adulterers, and murtherers
feare death, because they thinke, and it is certaine,
that all their ioy ends with their death; and let not
Gods children feare death, because it is an entrance
into ioy, and eternall felicity in heauen.</p>

            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> seeing all things are mutable in this

There is nothing vnder the Sunne which is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,
but all subiect to diuers mutations: kingdomes
are subiect to mutability, as we may see by <hi>Israel</hi> and
<hi>Iudah,</hi> how did they flourish for a time, now they

How often hath the gouernement of <hi>Rome</hi> beene

Sunne. Though a man liue many yeares, and in them
all he reioyce, yet hee shall remember the daies of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
because they are many, all that commeth is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
Eccl.</hi> 11. 7. 8. Man is not perpetuall, for man is
borne to die, as we see daily by experience: Houses
built with great cost and charge become ruinous:
Trees haue but a time and then wither. What is
there vnder the Sunne that is perpetuall? The light
of our eyes is but for a time, but the happinesse of
the godly lasteth for euer. The rich man can haue
his riches but for a time, nor the great man his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
nor the King his Crowne, nor the wanton
his pleasures, but the godly mans happinesse lasteth
for euer. The true difference betweene earthly
things and heauenly consisteth in this, earthly
things are much desired, but being obtained they
content little, heauenly things are desired little, but
once gained, satisfie much; and therefore <hi>lay not vp
treasure vpon earth, where the moth and canker corrupt,
and where theeues dig through and steale.</hi>

and so brifly will speake as the present occasion, and
your expectation requireth: that as I haue hitherto
spoken of death, so now I may say something also of
this dead subiect presented here before your eyes.
This worshipfull Gentleman,<note place="margin">Discent.</note> descended from wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull
parents, who were well knowne to many li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
among vs.<note place="margin">Education.</note> His education was in learning, first
in schooles in the countrey; then to <hi>Oxford,</hi> where
he became so studious, that he excelled many of his
ranke. From thence hee was sent to the Innes of
Court; there he made such proceedings, that hee
might haue been inferior in nothing to such as are
right honorable, if he had continued; but he chose
rather to liue priuately with contentation, then in
great places where contentment is hardly to bee
found. I will speake with your fouourable patience,
somthing of his learning, of his life, and so of his
death.</p>
            <p>First touching his learning,<note place="margin">Learning.</note> he was a good Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marian,
he did both write and speake good latine:
touching his writing, his booke written in latine, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
to the Kings Maiesty, will testifie the truth
thereof. Touching his speaking of latine readily,
such as haue conferred with him, can relate. He was
a good Phylosopher, a good Historian, some Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
a man well read in Physicke: and for distillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and secrets; few can second him. Touching di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity,
he had read the Bible, and expositors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
both old and new, ancient and moderne. Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
was his study now for the most part, wherein he
did so busie himselfe, that he intended (if it had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb facs="tcp:15583:14"/>
God) to haue printed a booke of the grounds of
Christian religion, collected in latine, wherein hee
shewed great reading, good iudgement, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
of knowledge. It were to be lamented, were
it not that the good pleasure of Almighty God was
such, that so much learning should goe to the graue,
and such good parts as were in him, should be buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the earth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, his life was answerable to his learning,<note place="margin">Life.</note>
he was sober in his carriage, affable in company, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
and of an humble spirit towards all; not coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous,
for he was dead to the world; not proud, no
quarreller, no drunkard; and for any thing I can
speake (or any other charitable Christian) blamelesse
from all great, enormous, and scandalous offences;
being full of the workes of the spirit: he was a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker,
he would perswade such as did contend, and
take paines to compose strife: he would giue of his
owne to end that which malice had begunne: hee
was charitable to the poore, and pittifull to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed.
His brethren &amp; sisters haue lost for a time,
the company of a deere and comfortable brother:
his kindred a good Counseller, the poore an almes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuer;
and other Ministers &amp; my selfe, a kind friend,
and I doubt not but God hath receiued his soule.
Lastly,<note place="margin">Death.</note> touching his sicknes &amp; death, his sicknes was
<hi>Morbus haereditarius</hi> (as himselfe would call it) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with a feuer.<note place="margin">The stone.</note> In his sicknes he was pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
&amp; willing to leaue this miserable world. And as
his life was quiet, so he died quietly. Now the Lord
grant vs grace so to spend all our dayes in his feare,
that at length we may dye in his fauour, and receiue
the reward of euerlasting life.</p>
