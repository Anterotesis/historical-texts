            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THere was lately preſented to thy view, <hi>A brief Relation of the killing of</hi> John Townſend, <hi>by Mr.</hi> Crosby, <hi>at</hi> St. Albans; with ſome hints of the almoſt incredible unworthy deportment of Sir <hi>Harbotle Grimſtone</hi> in the Tryal of the ſaid <hi>Crosby:</hi> And we well hoped there would never have been occaſion to trouble thee with any thing further relating thereunto; eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſaid Sir <hi>H. G.</hi> he having ſuch an open and manifeſt Item or Warning <note n="†" rend="inter">A little Paper ſent him, enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>Law Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Tim. 3.13.</note> (as it were) ordered and dispoſed by a hand of Providence for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, Admonition, and Reformation: But we ſee the Scriptures verified, <hi>Evil men wax worſe and worſe.</hi> For, <hi>when the unclean Spirit</hi> ſhall <hi>return</hi> the ſecond time into any man,<note rend="inter">Mat. 12.43, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> he brings <hi>with him other ſpirits more wicked than himſelf,</hi> and ſo that man is <hi>worſe</hi> than before. This latter Act of Sir <hi>H.</hi> in the Second Tryal of <hi>Crosby,</hi> ſeems to be produced by the inspiration of ſome ſuch conjunction of <hi>unclean ſpirits</hi> returning, and taking poſſeſſion within him, if we conſider, <hi>firſt,</hi> What a ſhew of Righteouſneſs and Juſtice his former actions and deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſeemed to carry in them, as though he had been no <hi>Lover,</hi> nor would ever have been a <hi>Countenancer</hi> of Cruelty, Oppreſſion and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That <hi>Item</hi> or Warning from God (as he might reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably judge it) lately mentioned. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> His great endeavours (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding) at the Second Tryal, to turn the Sun into Sackcloth, and the Moon into Darkneſs; by labouring to corrupt the Law it ſelf; and under pretence thereof, to juſtifie ſuch broad-fac'd illegal proceedings. <hi>Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> The proper tendency of that Maxime contained in his Speech at the ſaid Tryal; the native inference, and proper import whereof, as it could any wayes reaſonably be compelled to relate to the caſe in hand, was this,
<pb facs="tcp:39109:3"/>
               <hi>The man that</hi> Crosby <hi>kill'd, was at an unlawful Aſſembly; therefore it was no Murder.</hi> This Inference, if received and admitted for good Law, will deprive a great number of the People of <hi>England</hi> of that ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, even of Life it ſelf, which the Law affords them: for, not only all that ſhall dare to Obey GOD, in meeting together to Pray, Reade the Scriptures <note n="†" rend="inter">Act. 4.19. &amp; 5.29.</note>, and Preach the Goſpel, (though in ſo doing they ſhould diſobey Man) will hereby be obnoxious to be killed and murdered, without benefit of Law; but likewiſe all Drunken Companies at Alehouſe or Tavern, at unlawful times; and all Riotous, Diſturbers of the Peace, (with multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of other Caſes) though the Crimes be never ſo ſmall, yet if the Meetings be unlawful, they may, by the ſaid Rule, be knock'd on the head, Piſtol'd, or cut in pieces, without benefit of Law. And <hi>fifthly,</hi> if we add, That by this means the whole courſe of Justice, in many caſes, may be obſtructed: What need the fetching of Warrants, and calling of Conſtables? &amp;c. If the Aſſembly be unlawful, it is no more ado (by the ſaid Inference) but <hi>Knock them down.</hi> All the Laws that provide leſſer penelties for Drunkards, Swearers, and Diſturbers of the Peace; with many petty Offenders more, (if the Meetings are unlawful) will ſeem as ſo many impertinencies; there is <hi>a nearer way to the Wood,</hi> than to trouble our ſelves, and be at charges to proceed againſt them regularly; A <hi>Piſtol,</hi> or a <hi>Sword,</hi> or a good <hi>Fowling-Piece</hi> may do the deed.— As for that falſe gloſſe, or pretence of <hi>the Execution of an Office,</hi> with which Sir <hi>H.</hi> ſeemed in his Speech to colour the unworthineſs of this Fact, the Reader may find it waſhed away in the enſuing Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe, with ſeveral other Conſiderations of like demerit in Sin and Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity with them (ſome of which are taken notice of in the following Papers) ſeem to demonſtrate this latter act of Sir <hi>H.</hi> many degrees worſe than the former: And conſequently the more like unto the fruit of <hi>the unclean Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit's</hi> returning <hi>with ſeven worſe than himſelf;</hi> and we heartily wiſh he may bethink himſelf, and repent before it be too late, left <hi>his laſt ſtate be worſe than his firſt;</hi> which we beſeech the God of Grace and Mercy to prevent; in which Prayer, if Sir <hi>H.</hi> himſelf ſhall cordially joyn with us, and deſire indeed to <hi>recover himſelf out of the ſnare of the Devil;</hi>
               <note rend="inter">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26.</note> let him give ear unto the Counſel of the Spirit of God, to <hi>ſeparate from the unclean thing,</hi> and caſt in his <hi>lot</hi> with the <hi>righteous,</hi> and not be afraid to <hi>obey God rather than man:</hi>

            <p>VVE make little queſtion but that in the ſecret of your hearts and conſciences, you will give the right hand of fellowſhip to that Suppoſition, ſo generally received for truth up and down the Country, namely, <hi>That your proceedings in the firſt Tryal of Mr.</hi> Crosby, <hi>were irregular and illegal:</hi> A demonſtrative proof not only of the thing it ſelf, but of your conviction thereof, you gave unto the world, in that you brought him to Tryal the Second time: for (as the Apoſtle reaſoneth in another caſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.7.) <hi>if the Firſt had been faultleſs, then ſhould no place have been ſought for the Second.</hi> But, hath your latter Tryal relieved the imperfection of the former? If not, let us prevail with you to make a third attempt; poſſibly, though the firſt and ſecond <hi>Arrow</hi> may fly at <hi>rovers,</hi> yet the third may <hi>hit the mark</hi>; but, if that ſhall miſcarry in your hands alſo, We ſhall then deſire you to yeeld up the <hi>Bucklers of Judgement,</hi> and <hi>Seat of Judicature</hi> unto ſome more skilfull hands, and perſons more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, or more ready to yeeld Obedience, to the Mind of God in ſuch Affairs. But, to preſs our Motion by an Argument, take it thus:</p>
            <p>If in your Second Tryal of <hi>Crosby,</hi> you have miſcarried in two main Deſigns, wherewith you (manifeſtly) travelled, as in birth to be delivered: then will the Motion now made appear reaſonable. <hi>Sed verum prius, Ergo &amp; poſterius.</hi>

            <p>The Conſequence in the firſt Propoſition, we ſuppoſe is not like to meet with oppoſition from your <hi>Conſciences:</hi> The demonſtration of the latter we fear will diſturb your <hi>Paſſions</hi>; but however, we are Commiſſioned from God, the Great King of Heaven, ſo to trouble men, rather than to indulge them in wayes of Sin; <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.17. For the proof therefore of this Aſſertion, it is to be conſidered in the firſt place, what theſe two main Deſigns are, mentioned in the Argument; which, partly from ſeveral words and paſſages that have ſlipt the tongue: and partly, from the whole ſeries of action relating hereunto, appear to be theſe two; 1. The ſafety and ſecurity of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:39109:4"/>
of <hi>Crosby.</hi> 2. The preſervation and vindica<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>on of your own Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dits and Reputation in ſo doing. But have you proſpered in theſe Deſigns by your latter Tryal? No ſurely!</p>
            <q>
               <l>Non eſt in Medico ſemper relevetur ut aeger:</l>
               <l>Interdum docta plus valet arte malum. i.</l>
               <l>The Doctor cannot alwayes help the ill:</l>
               <l>The ſickneſs ſometimes is beyond his skill.</l>
            </q>
            <p>This Project or Device, inſtead of <hi>bleſſing</hi> you in theſe two, hath <hi>curſed</hi> you altogether; So that it may well be ſaid in this caſe, as ſometimes <hi>Jethro</hi> ſaid, <hi>(Exod.</hi> 18.11.) <hi>In the things wherein they dealt proudly,</hi> and ſubtilly, <hi>God was above them.</hi> Behold all ye Judges of the World, and wonder; Stand amazed ye Rulers of men, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the Wiſdom and Juſtice of God, who <hi>taketh the Wiſe in their own Craftineſs:</hi> and <hi>confoundeth</hi> the Counſel of the <hi>Mighty</hi>; when enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in promoting that which his Soul hates: for, lo, theſe men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining the path of Righteouſneſs, the only way to true honour and ſafety; are fallen into the pit of deſerved Reproach, Ignominy, and Danger. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is manifeſt, that <hi>Crosby</hi> is not <hi>legally</hi> diſcharged or acquitted from the Bill of Indictment for <hi>Wilful Murder,</hi> preferred againſt him both at the firſt and ſecond Tryal: This is evident from hence, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſaid Bill preferred againſt him at the ſecond Tryal, was ſtifled in the birth, and lies dormant to this day, unexamined and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined: And conſequently waits for a Tryal, when God ſhall ſtir up the heart of any man that loves Juſtice and Righteouſneſs, to proſecute him; and open the ears of Magiſtrates impartially to hear, and faithfully to judge in the caſe. In the mean time it hideth it ſelf under this Maxime (conveyed unto us by way of Proverb) <hi>Murder will out</hi>; and ſooner, or later, bring the <hi>Murderer</hi> to condign puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Neſcia mens hominis Fati, ſortiſque futurae. i.</l>
               <l>Weak is the mind of man, this day to ſee</l>

            </q>
            <p n="2">2. For the other Deſign mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> the preſervation, or vindication of your own Credit and Reputations: That herein alſo you have ſuffered, and not gained by the latter Tryal, ſhines with a Noon-day light: for, 1. when you had (after the firſt Tryal) bound the Widow to proſecute him the Seſſions following, becauſe ſhe could
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:39109:5"/>
not be prevailed with to deſiſt from her Bill for <hi>Wilful Murder,</hi> and to indict him for <hi>Manſlaughter</hi>; the Clerk of the Peace (it ſeems) drew up another Bill for <hi>Manſlaughter</hi>; [whether by your, or any of the Juſtices order, or whether of his own head, we leave either for you to determine, or the people to conjecture, as you and they ſhall find cauſe] Both theſe Bills being preferred againſt <hi>Crosby,</hi> the Grand Jury take no notice of the Bill for <hi>Wilful Murder,</hi> preferred by the Widow who was bound to proſecute; but they <hi>found</hi> the Bill for <hi>Manſlaughter,</hi> upon which you proceeded. Wherein, in the firſt place, there ſeems to be an eye (at leaſt) of hypocritical deceit in your proceedings; to bind the Widow to proſecute, and yet to reject or ſtifle her Bill of Indictment; or however, to wink or connive at the ſmothering of it. And ſecondly, there ſeems alſo to be in it, a great betraying of your truſt, in as much as <hi>Juſtice</hi> ought to <hi>know no faces,</hi> nor to ſtifle any legal proceedings. Therefore, were there no more but this, it were enough to demonſtrate that your <hi>decayed Credits,</hi> or the ruines made upon your Reputations by the former Tryal, were no wayes relieved or repaired by the latter.</p>
            <p>But 2ly, The Conſideration of the quality of the perſons impan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelled upon the Jury of Life and Death, in the Second Tryal, adds to the ſtain, rather than purgeth your <hi>beſmeared</hi> Reputations: for, Were they all capable by the Law of <hi>England</hi> to be of ſuch a Jury? Had they all forty ſhillings <hi>per annum</hi> (at the leaſt) of freehold Eſtate? Or, what rank or quality were they of? The Anſwer is ready; there was <hi>Nicholas Goulding,</hi> and <hi>Joſhua Carpenter,</hi> Inkeepers: <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Campfield,</hi> a Grocer: <hi>Ralph Bradbury,</hi> the Chandler: <hi>Richard Martin,</hi> the Blackſmith: <hi>Roger Napkin,</hi> the Barber: <hi>Thomas Radram, James Rambridge, Gowen Crosfield,</hi> and <hi>James Totnum,</hi> Alehouſe-keepers: <hi>James Hopkins,</hi> the Fidler: and <hi>Griffin Jones,</hi> the Tapſter at the Lion-Inn. Amongſt all which Sir <hi>Harbotle</hi> himſelf, with all his Art, Skill, Learning, Logick, Rhethorick, far fetch'd Circumlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, and Law-querks; with what other tricks and evaſions ſoever he ſhall pleaſe to ſet on work for the Deſign, will notwithſtanding be too hard put to it to find out three Freeholders; and we preſume he will be foiled in the undertaking, unleſs he claim a priviledge above all other mortals, and aſſume to himſelf the Prerogative Royal, which is altogether incompetent to him, viz. <hi>to call things that are not, as if they were.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither, 2ly, will the excellent qualifications of theſe Jury-men for ſuch a ſervice, any whit relieve their Legal-incapacity in point of quality, nor befriend the decayed Reputations we ſpeak of; For,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:39109:5"/>
are not the moſt knowing, ſober, honeſt and conſiderate men, only fit for ſuch a work? But for theſe men, What were they? Were they not a company of ignorant, inconſiderate, heady, wicked, ungodly, vicious, debauched, prophane, drunken, and ſwearing fellows? Nay, were not many of them, Companions in ſin and iniquity with the Delinquent under Tryal, and ſuch who were reſolved (right or wrong) to clear him? It were eaſie for him who can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to rake into the Dunghil of other mens noiſom and ſtinking miſcarriages, to make a great pile of quotations under this head; but we leave that work to them who take pleaſure therein. But may we not lament in this caſe, <hi>Oh miſerable Town, where no better Jury-men can be found, in a Caſe of Life and Death for Wilfull Murder!</hi> By what hath been thus far hinted, we preſume you ſee, that the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Tryal of <hi>Crosby mended your Reputations,</hi> much like <hi>as a hot Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers day mends ſowr Ale.</hi> But,</p>
            <p n="4">4ly. Though this be more than enough, yet to allude to that of the Prophet, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8.6. <hi>Turn thee yet again, and thou ſhalt ſee greater Abominations:</hi> for, Behold, a <hi>Maſter</hi> (of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall we ſay? nay, but rather) of the <hi>Bench,</hi> to ſet a fair gloſſe upon an evil action, gives ſuch a <hi>definition of Murder,</hi> the like whereunto (being applyed to the caſe before you) we believe was never before given by any ſober man in his right wits; much leſſe by a man that knew the Law; leaſt of all by one read in the Law of God: For to affirm, <hi>That if a man be found in an unlawful Aſſembly, and ſhall be kill'd by another man in the execution of his Office to ſuppreſs that Aſſembly, this is not Murder; and the perſon kill'd in this caſe, hath his mends in his own hands: But that Murder is, when a man ſhall be kill'd being in his lawful imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp;c.</hi> We ſay, to plead thus, being applied to the caſe before you, Is it not either abominably abſurd, or notoriouſly impertinent, or both? For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The bare, or ſimple <hi>unlawfulneſs</hi> of any Meeting, doth not render the perſons worthy of <hi>Death</hi> by the Law; for, if ſo, then every man found guilty of a Riot, muſt die for it; and every company of Drunkards, found at an Alehouſe or Tavern at unlawful times, ought to die for it; which you know would be <hi>Durus Sermo,</hi> a hard ſaying, not to Mr. <hi>Crosby</hi> onely, but to many others of your Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Complices and Confederates; and well were it if profound Dr. <hi>Arris</hi> could eſcape in ſuch a caſe. Such inſtances of <hi>unlawful Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies</hi> might be numerous, wherein the Law hath provided leſſer penalties than Death: therefore every Offender in unlawful Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies is not by the Law guilty of Death; and conſequently ought not
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:39109:6"/>
to have this puniſhment inflicted on him for it. And we know no reaſon why a man's being preſent at a Funeral, <hi>hearing a Sermon in the Schoolwhite,</hi> ſhould be any wayes a more criminal fact deſerving death, rather than Drunkenneſs; eſpecially conſidering, that God approves the one, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. but threatneth the other with eternal wrath, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. Neither is it lawful for a Conſtable, or other Officer, to kill any man ſimply for being found in ſuch unlawful acts, which by the Law do deſerve death: but all ſuch Offenders are to be apprehended, and impriſoned, in order to a legal Tryal and Conviction; but not to be kill'd by inferiour Officers. Eſpecially,</p>
            <p>In the third place, Where there is no manner of Reſiſtance or Oppoſition; in this caſe, though the Meeting be unlawful, and the Fact notoriouſly criminal; yet, if the Officer wilfully kill a man, he is guilty of Murder: For, the utmoſt that can be ſaid ſoberly, and with truth, to juſtifie an Officer in this kind, is, That when a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, or other lawful Officer, ſhall be reſiſted with force of Arms, and oppoſed in the Execution of his Office, if in this caſe he kill a man, he will be found excuſable by the Law: but where no ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance is made, if he wilfully kill any man, though at an unlawful Aſſembly, either he muſt die as a Murderer; or elſe the Law muſt be violated for his preſervation. But in the caſe of <hi>Crosby</hi> there was not the leaſt Reſiſtance given to any Officer, nor ſhadow of Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to any man; unleſs it were the oppoſition of the <hi>Sword of the Spirit, the Word of God,</hi> which fought againſt the ſinful luſts and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of men, in the preaching of the Goſpel; Mens attendance upon which is ſo far from deſerving death, as that it is their abſolute duty, impoſed upon them by the ſupream Law of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Nay, fourthly, This Aſſembly was ſo far from reſiſting an Officer, that they publickly aſſerted the contrary; for, Mr. <hi>Heaward</hi> who was preaching, openly declared unto <hi>Crosby</hi> himſelf, when he came firſt unto them, <hi>That if he had any Authority to command him, he would obey it</hi>; after which publick Teſtimony of their peaceable diſpoſition, <hi>Crosby</hi> firſt threatened; then went away and fetch'd his Piſtol; cock'd it, and preſented it to <hi>John Townſend</hi>'s throat; gave fire, and kill'd him. So that if <hi>Crosby</hi> had been a <hi>lawful Officer,</hi> and the Meeting <hi>unlawful</hi>; yea, though the man kill'd had been deeply criminal in point of Fact, yet inaſmuch as he met with no Reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, he muſt have died as a Murderer, or the Law be violated for his ſake. Again,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, By what was laſt hinted, and might eaſily be further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:39109:6"/>
it appears to be a contrived piece of Villany, which had deliberate malice in it: which is further evident from hence; partly, becauſe after he had killed one, he purſued another: and partly alſo, becauſe he had no remorſe when he ſaw he had killed him; but when one of the Conſtables laid hold of him, and asked him, <hi>Do you know what you have done? you have Murdered a Man. Crosby</hi> replied, <hi>What care I?</hi> So that from what hath been hitherto declared, it fully appeareth, that if <hi>Crosby</hi> had been a <hi>lawful Officer,</hi> yet that could not <hi>legally</hi> have exempted him from ſuffering as a Murderer for this Fact. But how much leſſe, when we conſider,</p>
            <p>Sixthly, That <hi>Crosby</hi> was <hi>no Officer,</hi> authorized by the Law to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs unlawful Aſſemblies: for his Commiſſion to be a Lieutenant to a Troop of Horſe (ſuppoſe he have ſuch a Commiſſion, which we know not) yet this only impowers him to act under the Command of his ſuperiour Officers, and that in a warlike capacity; but gives him no power to diſturb, ſhoot, and kill peaceable men, for hearing the Word of God preached, and no other cauſe.</p>
            <p>That which is pleaded to relieve him in this caſe, is but a <hi>Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaf,</hi> inſtead of a <hi>Covering</hi>; namely, <hi>That</hi> Crosby <hi>was commanded by the Conſtable to aſſiſt him in the Suppreſſion of this Meeting.</hi> For,</p>
            <p>Firſt, If that were true, yet there being no reſiſtance, the Law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines his Fact of killing the Man, to be <hi>Wilful Murder</hi>; and he ought by Law to ſuffer accordingly.</p>
            <p>But, ſecondly, That <hi>Crosby</hi> was not commanded by the Conſtable, but that he commanded one of the Conſtables, and threatned to piſtol him if he would not go with him: This is too evident to be denied by any, who have not hardened their hearts, and brazened their faces to contend againſt the Truth. As for what was procured to be affirmed in Court by one of the Conſtables in ſeeming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction hereunto; there is nothing at all in it wherewith to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it ſelf to the Judgment and Conſcience of, or to gain credit and belief amongſt any ſober men; but it ſavoureth much more of ſomewhat that is worſe than of the Truth: For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The contrary might evidently be proved, if the ears of the Juſtices were not ſtopt againſt Juſtice and Truth; and if <hi>he that departeth from evil</hi> [and ſpeaketh the Truth faithfully] did not <hi>make himſelf a prey, (Iſa.</hi> 59.15.) But,</p>
            <p n="2">2ly. The Conſtable who was prevailed with to affirm the ſame, was himſelf <hi>acceſſory to the Fact</hi>; as is demonſtrated in print alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and might eaſily be further proved; and therefore his <hi>Oath,</hi> much leſs his <hi>bare word,</hi> ought not to be admitted in Judgment.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:39109:7"/>3ly. That <hi>Crosby</hi> was not commanded by the Conſtable, appears beyond all rational contradiction, from hence, Becauſe at his firſt coming, when he denounced his Threatning againſt them, with an Oath, he had then no Conſtable with him; But when he returned to execute his Threatning, he brought a Conſtable with a Fowling-Piece in his hand: which plainly demonſtrates, that the Conſtable was brought by <hi>Crosby,</hi> and not he by the Conſtable.</p>
            <p>From all which Conſiderations it appears as clear as the Sun when he ſhineth in his brighteſt luſtre, That the definition of Murder be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpecified, at leaſt ſo far as it could be forced to relate to this Caſe, was altogether impertinent, and moſt abominably abſurd and unworthy; tending to no other end at beſt, but to <hi>darken counſel by words without wiſdom</hi>; (Job 38.2.) and to delude an ignorant Jury. And conſequently that great deſign intended by you in the Second Tryal of <hi>Crosby,</hi> namely, of repairing thoſe Ruines of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation which his former Tryal had brought upon you, altogether fails in your hand in thſs latter alſo: for, lo, your Credit and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations ſtill lie in the duſt, notwithſtanding what you have thus done to relieve them. And together, therewith, that which is an hundred-fold more ſad, through your means <hi>Blood-guiltineſs</hi> remains upon the Town of <hi>St. Albans</hi>; and there will remain until it ſhall be purged away by the <hi>Blood of the Murderer.</hi> Reade and conſider deligently, <hi>Numb.</hi> 35. ver. 31, and 33. compared together.</p>
            <p>By this time (we preſume) we have demonſtrated unto you, (more clearly and ſufficiently than you were willing or deſirous to hear) That your two grand Deſigns, aimed at in your Second Tryal of <hi>Crosby,</hi> have notoriouſly miſcarried under your hand; and conſequently our advice unto you, <hi>to review your handy-work, and amend it</hi>; may be neither unreaſonable nor unſeaſonable counſel: There being no reaſon why a man ſhould not amend that which is amiſs, nor no time unſeaſonable for Reformation.</p>
            <q>

            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:39109:7"/>But Sir <hi>Harbotle,</hi> to cloſe up all, we have an odd reckoning or two, to ſet ſtreight with your ſelf, and we ſhall conclude at preſent: You were pleaſed to inform your Auditory in open Court, <hi>that there was a libellous Pamphlet diſperſed up and down the Country; put out by ſome railing</hi> Rabſhakeh, <hi>who durſt not put his name to it; full of lies and ſcandalous reproaches; which, though it reflected upon your ſelf, yet you valued it no more than the dirt under your feet; having the peace of Conſcience within, you were no wayes diſturbed in your ſleep by that, &amp;c.</hi> Sir, leaving the Author thereof, whoever he was, to his own further vindication, or future ſilence, as he ſhall think meet: We ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That for the ſubſtance of that Paper, ſo far as it concerns the ſtory of <hi>Crosby,</hi> it is too well known to be contradicted; And beſides, it hath already paſt the tryal of many ſober and honeſt men (both Friends and Enemies) who were eye and ear-witneſſes of the things contained therein, and hath received a ſentence of juſtification from them all, with a <hi>Nemine Contradicente,</hi> as to matter of the truth of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It hath paſt the like ſcrutiny, with the like good ſucceſs in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the ſobriety of the language and ſtile of it. Only this we confeſs, that if to call a <hi>Hare,</hi> a <hi>Hare</hi>; or a <hi>Botle,</hi> a <hi>Botle,</hi> and that too in the ſofteſt words that could eaſily be found; if this be <hi>a falſe accuſation,</hi> or <hi>ſcandalous reproach,</hi> then is that Paper guilty; but otherwiſe it is free. And conſequently it will appear, that in this you were of <hi>counſel</hi> for the Devil, endeavouring to promote his work, who makes it one great part of his buſineſs, falſly to accuſe the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent. <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.10.</p>
            <p>But Sir, if when you have ſifted the ſaid Paper to the bran, and ground it to powder, in the Mill of your ſtricteſt ſearch, and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roweſt ſcrutiny into it, you can find ground to make good your ſaid Charge againſt it, then we challenge you, as you will vindicate your Honour and Reputation, to juſtifie your ſelf therein in print.</p>
            <p>But for the reaſon why he that writ it, (whoever he was) put not his name to it; (leaving him to the reaſon of his own actions, yet) this we ſhall ſay to it, That you cannot be ſo ignorant, or weak, as not to know, (you, with others, having taught us to underſtand by woful Arguments of ſence and feeling) that theſe are times where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Truth faileth, and he that departeth from evil, maketh himſelf a prey:</hi> becauſe Juſtice and Righteouſneſs are compelled to give way, to Cruelty and Oppreſſion; therefore it ſeems neither Wiſdom nor
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:39109:8"/>
Chriſtianity, for a man to expoſe himſelf to your Rage and Malice, when he may innocently avoid it: eſpecially, having ſuch a lively Inſtance and Example of your promptneſs and skill to make <hi>a Noſe of Wax</hi> of the Law, and by cunning devices, and ſubtil ſtratagems and agents, to pervert the courſe of Juſtice, he could not reaſonably expect any fair quarter from you: For,
<q>
                  <l>Impedit Irae animum, ne poſſit cernere Verum; <hi>i. e.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>By Wrath ſo hindred is the mind,</l>
                  <l>That Truth it cannot ſee, or find.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>As for your high pretences of <hi>Peace of Conſcience</hi> in what you have done, and <hi>that you are no wayes diſturbed in your ſleep by the ſaid Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, &amp;c.</hi> We reply,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Spirit of God informs us, that, as on the one hand, <hi>it is joy to the Juſt to do Judgement,</hi> Prov. 21.15. So on the other hand, that <hi>the Wicked ſleep not except they have done miſchief,</hi> Prov. 4.16.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> gives us to underſtand that ſome men in the world were like ſo far to <hi>corrupt their minds,</hi> as to <hi>ſuppoſe that Gain is Godlineſs.</hi> (1 Tim. 6.5.) So that it is no great wonder to ſee wicked and ungodly men, to deceive <hi>themſelves,</hi> and their <hi>own hearts,</hi> as well as others.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For a man to live in wayes of ſin and unrighteouſneſs, and Conſcience not check or controul him for the ſame, is a great Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that ſuch a man is under the <hi>bewitching</hi> of the Devil, and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi> by a <hi>corrupt mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. For a man to pretend the Peace of Conſcience within, to colour over foul and horrid acts of ungodlineſs without, argues a <hi>ſeared Conſcience,</hi> (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2.) the very worſt of eſtates and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and neareſt unto perdition.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Chriſt himſelf hath foretold of ſuch a generation of men, who ſhould not only perſecute his People, but even <hi>think they did God ſervice</hi> in killing his faithful Servants and Followers, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 16.2.) which we ſee verified this day, when men pretend the Peace of Conſcience in <hi>condemning the Innocent,</hi> and <hi>diſcharging the Guilty</hi>; perſecuting the Servants of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and making them Offenders for no other cauſe, but becauſe they obey their Lord and Maſter <hi>JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST,</hi> and obſerve the Rules which by his Apoſtles
