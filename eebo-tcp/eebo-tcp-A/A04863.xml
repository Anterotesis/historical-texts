            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>First, you must confesse that one of your best Archers can hardly shoot any good sheffe arrow aboue twelue score off, to performe any great executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept vpon a naked ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">

                     </note> Truly no, your archer shall hardly get one in fiue of a ready shot, nay happely scarce one; besides, considering the execution of the one and the other, there is great oddes, and no comparison at all.</p>

                  <p>They may shoot thicke, but to small performance, except (as I said) vpon naked men or horse. But should there be led but eight hundred perfect hargubu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziers, or sixe hundred good musketiers against your thousand bowmen, I thinke your bowmen would be forced to forsake their ground, all premisses considered: and moreouer a vollie of musket or hargubuze goeth with more terrour, fury, and execution, then doth your vollie of arrowes.

Many more reasons might be alledged for the sufficiencie of the one, and the insufficiencie of the other, but others haue answered the same already, besides the proofe which dayly experience bringeth: and thus you heare mine opinion of your Bowes; desiring you (Gentlemen and others) not to conceiue sinisterly of me for this mine opinion, as not held of me for any dislike I haue of our old Archery of England: but that common experience hath made it most manifest in these our later warres: well wishing in my hart (had it bene Gods good will) that this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernall fierie engine had neuer bin found out.

                  <p>Marie, to many good purposes: For the first order of doubling the ranks (besides the readinesse it breedeth in the souldiers) doth serue to alter vpon a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den your grand square of men,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doubling of ranks and files serueth to sundry purposes.</hi>
                     </note> into a square of ground, or into a battell of dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble front, and to many other purposes, in framing of many small battallions one grand square. And againe, the second order in doubling of the files, doth serue to many such other purposes: as if vpon a sudden your foot enemy shall come to charge you vpon the flanke, then by doubling their files, and suddenly turning their faces vpon the enemie, they shall make of flanke the front, and so bee ready with double hands, either to receiue or giue the charge. For those battels of square of ground, or battels of double fronts, do bring many hands to fight at once: being verie aduantagious for footmen against footmen, as reason and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience proueth and sheweth.</p>
                  <p>And againe, if you draw or diuide your battell or battallions into maniples, to march through straights or narrow passages,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>To passe straights</hi>
                     </note> this order of doubling the files is verie ready and auaileable, as thus. If your battel or squadron be of 5184 pikes, whose square roote is 72: now your passage will permit but 8 men to march in front; then must you diuide your square root 72 by 8, so commeth it to be 9 ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niples of 8 men in rank or breadth. And say yet againe, that the straight or passage doth fall yet more narrow, or straighten lesse, then to containe 8 men in front, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cause euery maniple, at the verie entring of the straight, to double their files, and so of 8 you shall make 4 files per maniple: the which being shouldred vp close to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, will containe no more roome in breadth then the 8 did before. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing passed the straight, cause them to fall into their former proportion, and so maniple after maniple in passing the straight.</p>

                  <p>Now, for as much as I entend to frame both figures and tables of sundry sorts of battels and battallions, in our discourse following<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will at this instant bee the more briefe; supposing this, at this present to suffice. For he which conceiueth and

                        <hi>Example.</hi>
                     </note> As for example: If vnto the former number of 100 pikes, there were proportioned &amp; suted 100 shot, calliuer and musket, these would I draw out into 5 <hi>per</hi> rank, which would make 20 ranks. Those 20 ranks would I cut off or deuide in the middest, so should I haue 10 ranks for to sleeue the one flanke of the battallion, and 10 ranks for the other flanke, at 5 men per ranke, or 5 files in euery ranke, which is all one. These 2 sleeues being placed, may be doubled with the pikes by ranke or file, for practise sake only. But if you were engaged to fight with the enemie, I would wish all great sleeues of shot to be deuided into many small troupes, the one still to second another: as hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter shall be declared &amp; shewed. And lo here another order: the 2 grand sleeues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing al musketiers, as the battell or battallio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth aduance &amp; march on toward the enemy,<note place="margin">

Then presently those of the second ranke to step vp iust before the first rank, as the battell or bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallion marcheth, and so to discharge as their former fellowes had done before: &amp; then the 3. rank before the 2. &amp; the 4. before the 3. and so all the other ranks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently with this kind of double march: and at the traine of the last rank, those of the first to follow vp againe:<note place="margin">

to make Alto; and clapping their muskets on their rests, close one by an others shoulder, and each one hauing a care to his forefellowes, they shall at one instant, discharge altogether at one vollie vpon the enemy, and so retire, giuing place to other troupes: the maner and forme whereof shall by these figures fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing appeare.</p>

                  <p>Were the Companies all of pikes, with corslets complet and not mixt with bare pikes, (which is not lightly to bee found) the framing of any of these sorts of battels would be very ready and easie, and might be soone brought into any proportion without confusion: the which being of pikes armed and vnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, will require more care,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Battells consisting of armed and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed pikes, fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in three ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of wayes.</hi>
                     </note> labour, and paines, to the framing thereof. Now therefore I say, in three sorts or maners, most auaileable and most commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diously are battels framed in these dayes, consisting of armed and vnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med pikes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The first manner is when an army doth march with the one halfe of the armed pikes in the foreward, and the other halfe in the reareward of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed pikes. Now in the body of this battell I vnderstand no short weapon, (but reserue them to another place and vnto another purpose, as before I haue sayd, and will heareafter speake more thereof) but all pikes, for the battell thereby wold be more readily framed, more brauer in sight, and more stronger to fight, in mine opinion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The second fashion is, when the army marcheth company by company, with their armed pikes in the foreward and reareward of euerie particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The third order is, when an armie marcheth <hi>Maniple</hi> by <hi>Maniple,</hi> with the armed pikes in the Front and traine of euery particular <hi>Maniple.</hi> And besides this, when the armed pikes which do serue to arme the two flankes, do march the one part before, &amp; the other part behind, and these also are called <hi>Maniples</hi>: for a <hi>Maniple</hi> is here called so many rankes throughout the battell, as the battell is in length,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Maniple, what it is.</hi>
                     </note> at so many <hi>per</hi> ranke as they march in ordinance or array. And although the armed pikes which doe march at the head or taile of the arrayes of <hi>Maniples</hi> to arme the two sides, if it happen at any time that they march not to the full length of the battell, yet neuerthelesse when they be put vnto their office to arme the two sides, although they be not in length to the length of the battell, at so many in rank as is appointed to arme the two flankes, yet are they called <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niples</hi> also. And againe, any part of shot or pikes, that be drawne a part, to be set to defend any straight, or to scarmush, may also bee called a <hi>Maniple</hi>: but

                  <p>Now of these sundry sorts of imbattailling of men, as well of proportions of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality as of inequality, and of battallions of the same nature, as well euen as odde battallions, seruing to the framing of crosse battels with such other like, I will frame certaine calculations or tables, the which shall serue to sundry numbers of men &amp; orders, according to the iudgement of the skilfull souldier, which shall be in the last booke of these discourses.</p>

                     </note> I would not wish any such weapon in the body of a standing battell, if we might be prouided otherwise of pikes: my reasons are these. For the pikes being Terciard or charged ouer hand to encounter a battell of foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or couched vnder the foote to receiue any troupes of horse, do one of them fall so proportionally within or after another; euen as their rankes of men are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant in their seuerall stations, the second following the first, the third the second, and the fourth following the third, and so consequently euery ranke se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conding one another, that it seemeth it were as good for a man to come vpon a brasen wall (if they stand resolute) as vpon such a battell of pikes, except they should be marched or encountred with the like weapons and proportions. Now if this be the best course to receiue or charge footmen, then no doubt (not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus mingled with short weapons) it must needes be the best battell to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue a charge of horse.</p>

                  <p>Although you disalow and disproue to haue your battell of pikes mingled with short weapon; yet would you not alow them about the ensignes in the center of the battell?</p>

                     </note> For who doth not know that if the enemy be like to be victor, the armed pikes will yeeld backward as they feele themselues distressed, so as when the pikes are in such maner crashed and clustred together, that they can no longer charge and push with their pikes, then will the throng or presse in the center be so great, that the halberds and bils shall haue little roome to strike; nay short swords will hardly haue rome at that instant either to thrust or to strike. I would thinke daggers would do more execution at that time, and in that presse vntill one side fall to flight:<note place="margin">

For if you remember, in our former discourses, at the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall sortment of weapons, I allowed to euery hundred of men 8 or 10 halberds.

                  <p>Well, you haue satisfied vs herein; but what thinke you of sundry other opinions touching the lining of battels with shot or bowes?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>

                        </p>
                     </note>Touching such lining I will shew you mine opinion against them. Now first for that kind of lining which is vsed in placing a pike and a shot, I am sure that the shot cannot be so hurtfull to the enemy, as they will weaken the battell: my reason is this. No army, I am certaine, shall be so ordered, that the battell shall be left bare without his troupes of shot before, to keepe the enemy doing in skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish, vntill the battels be ready to ioyne, and charge or couch their pikes: at that instant haue the shot, that line the battell, their time to serue, euen as the pikes are couched,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>The reasons.</hi>
                     </note> and not before. Now let men of consideration and experience iudge, whether it be possible for them to discharge aboue one shot a peece, and that not aboue three rankes of them; and thereupon, whether those shot can at that time of seruice be such a strength to the battel, as if an armed pike were in the roome. I do suppose the battell would be much stronger, if the shot were rid from thence, and pikes in their places. Then it falleth out, that this kind of lining is not good.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lyning with shot in another sort more tollerable.</hi>
                     </note> Now, touching another kind of lining with shot, which is 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7, rankes of pikes; and then 3, 4, or 5 rankes of shot, and then pikes, and then shot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. In deede this kind of lining is the most tollerable, and yet not without his discommodities: for if such a battell ioyne with a battell of foote, the shot cannot play vntill the rankes of pikes before them are broken; which cannot be, but that their owne men and their enemy shall be mingled pell mell one among ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Then tell me by reason, how those shot can serue that are the lining, but they must needes kill as well their owne men, as their enemy, being thus min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled at all aduentures. And if this be the end of their seruice (as indeede it is) by a forced necessity to kill without choise, then must it needes follow, that they are rather hurtfull then seruiceable in that place: farre better therefore pikes in their romes.</p>

                  <p>I will most willingly: Therefore to begin, I will set downe to make a square battell of number of men, that is, so many men in front as in flanke: And let our whole number be 5000 men, of armed pikes, and single pikes one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Now to frame this quadrat battell, you shall take in the aforesaid tables, the numbers of proportions of equality, which are as 1 to 1. Then must you set downe your rule in this sort:<note place="margin">

This being done, multiplie the 3 number which is 5000, the number of men by 1, the second number, and it maketh still 5000, (for 1 doth neither multiplie nor deuide) then deuide the said first multiplied number 5000 by 1 the first number, and it maketh yet 5000. Now out of that 5000, you shall take the quadrat roote, which is 70. So 70 rankes of men shall your battell containe,<note place="margin">

For 70 multiplied into itselfe resulteth 4900, the which deducted out of 5000, there resteth 100 men, the which 100 men deuide by 70, so will there arise one more ranke of men, and yet will there remaine 30 men ouer, the which one ranke shall be ioyned vnto the 70 rankes aforesayd, so are they 71 in breadth and 70 in length: but to the end you may better vnderstand me, I will go shewing the same by figures, whereof this shall be the first.</p>

This being noted: then must you multiplie the 71 rankes of men in front by 3 foote, and they will amount vnto 213 foote, and the 213 foote shall be deuided by 5 foote, accounting 5 foote to a pase, and the geometricall pase to conteine 2 or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary going steps or pases of a man: so will there come forth 42 pases and 3 foot.

Thus shall this battell containe in flanke 46 rankes, and in front 108 men per ranke, as in this sixt figure will appeare. And there will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine 32 men, which are not contained within the bodie of the battell.</p>

Then see in 5000 men, how many be armed with corslets, and I set that there be 2000, as before is said in arming the Quadrat battell of number of men. Now shall you part these 2000 armed pikes into two proportionall parts, as 10 to 3, the one part to arme the two flanks,<note place="margin">

                  <p>In this case, hauing the Table in memorie, onely there resteth to commit vnto two expert officers (as Caporals of the field, or such like) at the time of setting the battell, that the one go vnto the head and the other vnto the traine of the Orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances or Arrayes: and let him that stands at the head, cause or commaund to turne or wheele either from the right hand, or from the left (as shal be most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient) 95 rankes, at 10 armed men per ranke, and hauing finished, to set the 95 rankes at 10 armed men <hi>per</hi> ranke, he shall cause them to turne their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from that part whither the Ordinances or Arrayes do looke, as you shal see designed in the eleuenth figure on the page next following.</p>

                  <p>Touching the second maner of framing of battels. First the calculation or table of the battell must be had in memory (as before is sayd) in what proportion the said battell would be framed, and the army marching company by company, as I will shew you in the 18 figure: euery captaine shall be commanded by the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant maior, to make so many rankes of their pikes as the length of the battell shall containe, as in the 18 and 19 figures shall appeare. Now let vs suppose the sayd battell to containe in length 52 rankes, with 10 rankes of armed pikes at the head, and as many at the trayne, as is shewed in the declaration of the ninth and 14 figures, and that euery Captaine doe make 52 rankes, with 10 armed pikes before, and 10 behind, as in the 18 figure is shewed. And if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Captaine be found which hath not to accomplish that number, let him ioyne with another Captaine, and betwixt them both let them make vp that number of 52 rankes. This being done, Captaine by Captaine shall set their rankes shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to shoulder the one of the other, and shall so frame the battell 52 rankes in length, with 10 armed pikes by ranke before, and 10 behind. After that shall bee framed the battell, as I will shew you in this 20 figure following. This being done, one of the 4 Caporals of the field, shall go vnto the head, and another vnto the reareward: then he which is at the head, shall take away from the front of the battell 3 rankes of armed pikes, and arme therewith one of the flankes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at 7 men <hi>per</hi> ranke in length, adioyning vnto them the 28 armed pikes, which he lacketh to furnish out the length of 46 rankes at 7 men <hi>per</hi> ranke, as is said in the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the 9 figure.</p>
                  <p>And the other Caporall or officer, which is at the traine of the battell. He also shall take away or draw foorth from the traine 3 rankes of armed pikes, and arme with them the other side or flanke, at 6 men <hi>per</hi> ranke, in length of 46 rankes. So shall the battell bee formed 46 rankes long, at 108 men <hi>per</hi> ranke in front or breadth, with 7 ranks of armed pikes in fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; as many in traine, &amp; with 7 armed men <hi>per</hi> ranke on the one flanke, &amp; with 6 men by ranke, on the other flanke armed pikes: as I shewed in the 8 figure of the table and also in the 21 figure following.</p>
                  <p>And there will remaine out of the body of the battell 32 men, and they shall bee placed as I sayd in the last of the third order, at the beginning: moreouer there remaines 72 armed men.</p>

                  <p>The maner of the third order is thus,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>The third order by marching ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niple by maniple.</hi>
                     </note> When the armie is caused to march <hi>Maniple</hi> by <hi>Maniple,</hi> with their armed pikes in vantgard and rearegard of euery particular <hi>Maniples</hi>; and with one <hi>Maniple</hi> all of armed pikes, which mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth in the vantgard of the <hi>Maniples</hi> which haue their vnarmed pikes in their middle or center: the which <hi>Maniples</hi> of all armed pikes, is that which serueth to arme the one flanke of the battell. Besides this, there marcheth another <hi>Maniple</hi> of all armed pikes, after all the <hi>Maniples</hi>; and this <hi>Maniple</hi> serueth to arme the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther flanke of the battell. And the <hi>Maniples</hi> must march the one after the other, as in the figure appeareth.</p>
                  <p>Now, there resteth how to bring those into <hi>Maniples</hi> of this last order, which do march in the full length of the battell, with their armed pikes in front and traine; the which shalbe done in this sort. Let it be supposed (as the 17 figure of the second order doth shew) that there shall be drawne foorth 15 men in ranke of armed pikes in length of the battel, which serue to arme the two flanks, out of 108 men <hi>per</hi> ranke, the breadth of the battell, there resteth 93 men <hi>per</hi> ranke for breadth or front. And these 93 must be diuided into so manie parts, as one would that the <hi>Maniples</hi> should march in ordinance or arraies, the one after another, as the way will permit.</p>
                  <p>Now say that I will haue the <hi>Maniples</hi> to march by 5 in a ranke, then must I deuide the 93 (the breadth of the battell) by 5, whereof commeth <hi>Maniples</hi> 18, which shall containe in length rankes 46 at 5 men in a ranke; and one <hi>Maniple</hi> remaining at 3 men <hi>per</hi> ranke; the which <hi>Maniple</hi> is also 46 rankes in length, at 3 men in rankes. Notwithstanding it shall march (in marching) at 5 men in ranke after all the <hi>Maniples</hi> aforesayd. And the 18 <hi>Maniples</hi> doe march with 7 rankes of armed pikes before, and 7 rankes after: and the <hi>Maniple</hi> of 3 <hi>per</hi> ranke, shall, at the time of setting the battell, distend to the shoulders of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Maniples</hi> at 3 <hi>per</hi> ranke, with 7 rankes, armed pikes in front, and 7 rankes ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med pikes in trayne. And the other two <hi>Maniples</hi> of armed pikes, which serue to arme the two flankes, the one marcheth in the vantgard, and the other in the reare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the <hi>Maniples</hi> which haue their vnarmed pikes in the middle (yet at 5 in ranke) as appeareth in the 22 figure, and at the instant that the battell is to be set, the Sergeant Maior shall accommodate and fasten the <hi>Maniples</hi> of all armed pikes, that marcheth in the foreward of all the <hi>Maniples,</hi> into 46 rankes, at 8 men armed <hi>per</hi> ranke, and the other <hi>Maniples</hi> shall follow from hand to hand, poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron to pouldron, the one to the other, as the 23 figure and 24 declareth, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with the armed <hi>Maniple,</hi> which armeth the flanke at 8 men in ranke by length. These <hi>Maniples</hi> thus brought shoulder to shoulder, one to the other, then

shall follow that <hi>Maniple</hi> of and <hi>per</hi> ranke (the which yet marcheth at 5 <hi>per</hi> ranke in array) and shall distend vnto the shoulders of the other <hi>Maniple,</hi> at 3 <hi>per</hi> ranke, with 7 armed pikes in front, and 7 in traine. After all this shall follow the other <hi>Maniple</hi> of all armed pikes, and shall stretch foorth vnto 7 in a ranke vnto the shoulder of the other <hi>Maniples,</hi> to arme the other flanke of the battell. And thus is the battel framed 46 rankes in length, at 108 men by ranke in breadth, with 7 rankes of armed pikes in front, and 7 in traine, and with 8 armed pikes in ranke, on the one flanke, and 7 in a ranke on the other flanke, of armed pikes, as in the 24 and 25 figures: and there remaines 32 armed pikes, the which shall be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as I said before, in the last maner of the third order.</p>

So may you also, as occasion shall require, set more armed pikes vpon any part, for the more strength and securitie of the battell. And this much may suffice,<note place="margin">

                     </note> so without question, is the shot the furie of the field: but the one without the other is weakened the better halfe of their strength. Therefore of necessitie (according to the course of warres in these dayes) the one is to be coupled &amp; matched with the other, in such conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient proportion, that the aduantage of the one may helpe the disauantage of the other. For a stand of pikes, though neuer so well armed, being charged &amp; assailed with the like, or a lesse number of shot, by euery mans iudgement would haue the worse, &amp; not able to abide the field, vnlesse they had shot, to answer their enemies shot. In like sort, any troupe of shot, though neuer so braue &amp; expert, being in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen field, hauing no stand of pikes, or such other weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor hedge, ditch, trench, or rampier, to relieue and succour them, could not long endure the force of horse, especially Launciers.<note place="margin">

                  <p>But were the one halfe (or more) of your shot, Muskets, as the <hi>Spanyardes</hi> most commonly now vse, and so to be wished with vs also, then lesse number of shot would serue and more of pikes,<note place="margin">

                     </note> (as I sayd at the beginning of our discourses.) For euery Musket, considering the wonderfull execution of that weapon, may be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued for two Caliuers. Touching the placing of these fierie weapons about the body of the battell, there hath bene, and yet is, sundry opinions.

                  <p>But before I come to the placing and ordering of shot (for being a weapon not skilfully and warily vsed, is of more daunger to our selues then to the enemy

Whereby it commeth to passe many times, that an hundred shot, hauing in skirmish discharged their peece three or foure times a peece, against two hundred of the enemies, and scarce slaine two of them.

                     </note> For I haue set 108 men in breadth, and 46 rankes in length: the reasons thereof I shewed you before: for by this meanes there commeth more hands at once to fight in front, and the flankes notwithstanding sufficient strong, especially hauing any aduantage by the seat, which battell commeth to be an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall square of ground, and a broad square of men, in proportion of inequalitie, as 7 is to 3,<note place="margin">

                     </note> that is two times, and a third of men more broad then long.</p>

                  <p>In encamping an army, it is accustomed most commonly to entrench round about the quarters thereof, for more security and strength to the allodge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and when it is so, the companies which haue the ward, are alwayes to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to gard the trenches, which is the wall of the campe. But in case there bee no trenches, the Corps de gard (in mine opinion) is not to be placed aboue 70, or 80, pases distance (as I haue said before) from the front of the allodgements in his place of armes; yet somtimes there be found ditches, bottoms, and vallies so strong, that it shall be good for the gards to be placed there, although they be far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther distant off,<note place="margin">

But not finding such naturall fences, the wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are to be placed, as before I haue sayd. For thus, as well for the security of the quarters, as for (if neede should require) to succour those companies, it is better they be placed neare then farre off. And it is to be noted, as a thing of great importance, that great silence be kept in the body of the watch, at the least all ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and lowd noises are to be excluded,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Also it is the Sergeant Maiors part to be sollicitous and diligent with the prince or Captaine Generall of the army, and the other superiour officers, for the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of armour, and other necessaries for the companies of his regiment, and for the other munitions of powder, match, lead, and victuals: the which he shal cause to be reparted vnto the Sergeants of the bands, to be by them deliuered vnto the Caporals, who are to distribute the same among the companies.</p>

                  <p>Now this partition being made (as is sayd) hee is to consider very well, whether the Corps de guard, where the company or companies are to enter into and stand, be fit and commodious; and also those of the gates and caualleros. And if they haue neede of repairing, let him cause it foorthwith to be done, and also the garrits and watch houses, where the posts and Sentinels are to be placed, and whether they bee sufficient to defend and keepe out the raine: and this to be done at the charge of the city or towne, as is accustomed. And if the Rounds cannot commodiously passe round about the wals, he is to cause it to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated foorthwith. And must see, that there be sufficient store of torches, cres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets, linkes, and lanthornes, as well to be kept in the Corps de guard, as for the roundes and counter roundes.

                  <p>At the opening of the Gates, the Sergeant Maior ought to appoint the Sergea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or Sergeants, that be of the gard, that they be present at the shutting &amp; opening of the same, and the souldiers alwayes to betake them to their armes, not suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring anie to carrie cloake, mantle or such like thing, to trouble them at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,

and that there first passe foorth at the wicket (which serueth for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) fiue or sixe souldiers, who shall discouer, take knowledge, and viewe, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentie or eightie pases out abroad into the fields: and finding all things safe and secure,<note place="margin">

And the issuing out of the people being ended, with the like regard and order ought the out-people to enter; alwayes hauing in the Corps de guard of the gate, both by day and night, two Sentinels, one at the weapons, and the other in the field; and that euerie one of these should haue a <hi>Spontone,</hi>

Now lastly to your demaund touching the marching and allodgement of a campe, I say: That when an Armie marcheth neare vnto the enemies Army, it is needfull that there be had many and great considerations:<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Many and great considerations in the marching of an Armie.</hi>
                           </note> as first when the one Armie is not of equall force vnto the other, or when one is not disposed to come to the fact of battell, for not to put, by one onely battell into the hands of fortune all a mans habilitie &amp; whole rest in fine, as many misaduised men haue done; therefore to prolong time, and to shunne the doubtfull fact of armes, it were needfull to make choise to march (if possible you may) through mountaine groundes and hillie, and with such ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage of seate and ground, that the enemy may not with any reason of aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, assault you: But when this may not be yet eschued, at the least it is to bee procured to be done to the best aduantages, and (as it were) with a certaine hope of victory; the which may partly bee performed when you know how to profit your selfe with the aduantage that the situation will affoord. And in your mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, I would wish you to send some part of your light horse so neare vnto the enemy, as continually you haue notice of all their orders and courses. True it is, that when you are in a countrey, where this aduantage of hils is not to be found, and must of necessitie march through plaines and champaine fields, and haue the enemy neare at hand, it were then very hard to shunne and auoide battell, the which I would rather wish to be done, then otherwise, especially if your Army do surmount your enemy in Cauallerie, for in such cases the battell is not to be refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, your strength consisting most in horse, the which by good conduction, giueth a great part to the victory.</p>

I haue moreouer distinguished the said camp into the vsual names of Vauward, Battel, &amp; Rereward, the pikes and shot, marked with the letter A, do belong to the Vauward, vnto whom do answere the Launciers, marked with the sayd letter A. And those marked with the letter B; do betoken the battell; vnto them do answer the men at armes, marked with B, also. And those marked with the letter C, are for the rere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, vnto whom do answer the light horse or Carbins, signed with the like letter C. The farther decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, practike rule, and order of the said encampement, shall on the next side following be at large declared and shewne.</p>

                           </note> I haue quartered the 1000 men at armes in 4 little quarterets containing in euery quarteret 250 men at armes: allowing for euery man at armes 6 allodgements, and 2 allodgements for his place of armes, which are 8 allodgements; containing euery allodgement 50 superficiall foote of ground,<note place="margin">

                           </note> that is, 10 foote in length, and 5 for breadth. Now, the working thereof is thus: multiply the 1000 men at armes by 8 allodgements, it maketh 8000 al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodgements, the which 8000 multiply againe by 50 foote superficiall, which is allowed for euery allodgement, and it maketh 400000 superficiall foote; the which 400000,<note place="margin">25 <hi>foote do make a superfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all pase of</hi> 5 <hi>foote.</hi>

So the 1000 men at armes doe require, 16000 pases superficiall for their quarters, and place of armes. Now to deuide these 1000 men at armes into 4 litle quarterets, each quarteret co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taining 250 men at armes, deuide the 16000 pases superficiall by 4, and the product will be 4000 superficiall pases for euery quarteret, whose square roote is 63, for the square of each quarteret, being quartered one way, with the great maine streete of 20 pases broade,<note place="margin">

                           </note> and the other way with a lesser streete of 10 pases broade. Now to know the square side of all these 4 quarterets, extract the quadrat root of the 16000 superficiall pases, being 126 pases, and that is the due square of euery side. Finally to know what square of ground, the place of armes for these thousand men at armes shall containe, multiply the 1000 men at armes by two allodge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of euery man, and it amounteth 2000 allodgements: then againe mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply these 2000 by 50 foote superficiall for each allodgement, and it maketh 100000 superficiall foote, this 100000 superficiall foote, deuide by 25, to bring them into superficiall pases, and it produceth 4000 pases superficiall; of this 4000 pases superficiall take the quadrat roote, which commeth out to be 63 pases square, little more.</p>
                        <p>Thus the place of armes of these 4 little quarterets, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taining in them all 1000 men at armes, doth containe 63 pases square, besides the breadth of the two streets, which crosse the quarters, not comprehended therein. Vpon the other side of the Generals place, and also without the two other places of market, and Noblemens lodgings, Southward, I haue dissigned the 2000 light horse, or Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins, deuided from the same by a street of 10 pases broade: vnto euery light horse I haue allowed 3 allodgements, and one allodgement for his place of armes, which doe make 4 allodgements for euery lighthorse. Now to multiply the

2000 light horse by 4, and it produceth 8000 allodgements: then I multiply a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the 8000 by 50 foote, and it amounteth vnto 40000 foote superficiall; then to bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into superficiall pases, I deuide the 4000000 foot by 25 (for 25 super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall foot, do make a superficiall pase) and the product will be 16000 superficiall pases,<note place="margin">

Now, to repart these 2000 light-horse into 4 litle quarterets, ech quarteret co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taining 500 light-horse, I deuide the 16000 pases superficiall by 4, and the product is 4000 superficiall pases, for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry quarteret, the square roote whereof is 63, being quartered one way with the great maine streete of 20 pases broade, running North and South, and the other way with a lesser streete of 10 pases broade, running East and West. Now againe, to know the square side of all these 4 quarterets; take the quadrat roote of the 16000 superficiall pases, which is 126 and little more, and that is the due square of euery side of all the 4 quarterets, not comprehending the breadth of the 2 streets which crosse the same therin; and the ½ of 126, which is 63, is the iust square side of euery one of the 4 little quarterets. And now lastly to know what quantity of ground the place of armes for these 2000 light horse will require,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Their place of armes.</hi>

Thus are the men at armes lodged vpon one side of the Generals place, and the light horse vpon the other side, as in the plat plainely appeareth.</p>
                        <p>Next, vpon the West part of the Generals place, and without the two quarters or lodgings of the Marshall and Treasurer, with a streete of 10 pases broade be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt, I haue lodged the 3000 launciers in 6 little quarterets,<note place="margin">

Now this 24000 superficiall pases, I deuide againe by 6 (for that I allodge the 3000 lanciers in 6 quarterets) and the product will bee 4000 superficiall pases for euery quarteret, the quadrat roote whereof being 63 little more, is the due square of pases euery way, of euery one of these 6 quarterets:<note place="margin">

                        <p>The marching and the encamping of an army being a continuate thing, the dislodging or remouing of a Campe must needes be a consequence. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will with as much breuitie, as I may conueniently, declare vnto you what I conceiue thereof; and that which hath bin seene in our time touching the same. Presupposing therefore, that there be two enemy Armies, encamped within sight one of another, or at the least not farre distant asunder, and because it is a most important matter, to know how many and sundry operations a braue man of warre or good chiefe may do, yet herein there is many considerations to be had. For although to retire by night,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Remouing by night.</hi>
                           </note> and to remoue away from the enemy, doth seeme to be the surest remedy that can be found, me thinkes, notwithstanding that the same is not sufficient inough to attaine an intention with securitie, if the said reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer be not befriended, either with the situation, or with some other parts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the countrey whether he meaneth to retire. And comming vnto the particulars, I say; that when a campe remoueth and dislodgeth by night, it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to vse all possible silence and diligence,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Silence and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</hi>
                           </note> the which if it be not assisted with the seate, and qualities of the countrey, it is not yet inough; as hee which is to march thorough a plaine and champain countrey, &amp; in open places, and not hauing (vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any occasion offered by the enemy) some woods, valley, riuer, rocks, or such like, thorough the which me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may hardly passe; but being so (as I say) it may the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> suffice
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:7227:88"/>
to hold skirmish: for that the enemies horse approching may be thereby hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and kept backe; but otherwise one shold be constrained to fight against ones will, with great disorder, especially carrying along the Artillery and other impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments of the campe,<note place="margin">

                           </note> the which with reason is not to bee left in pray to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy. And in like sorte it is not conuenient to march the Army out of his ordinary pace, for if a man bee ouer sollicitous and hastie therein, it would easily conioyne an euill opinion vnto the souldiers former conceipt, growne by such dislodging and retiring: a matter truly of great daunger to cause an vnremediable disorder to ensue, as many times it hath bin seene come to passe, whereas the army that pursueth the enemy,<note place="margin">

                           </note> hath not those impediments and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties: for they may leaue all impediments behind. And if the pursuer do march with speede, it is done with more desire and courage; the chieftaines vsing braue and honourable words, as in such cases be conuenient, and therefore (in mine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion) the dislodging by night is not very secure,<note place="margin">

                              <hi>Example.</hi>
                           </note>The very same case happened also vnto the protestants Army in <hi>Germany,</hi> when they would remoue and withdraw themselues from the Emperours campe, being both the Campes neare encamped together, that dislodging by night, they had not farre to march, to enter into a very strong valley, where they could not, but with the enemies great disaduantage, bee charged and set vpon: and for that there was in the same valley a little hill, the same was presently possest by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, and planted with good store of field ordinance, and with strong troupes of foote and horse, and in such sort occupied, that what with this preparation, and with that which they made in a neare adioyning wood, planting the same full of small shot; the Emperours power could not pursue them, as they had pretended. For as soone as they were approched neare vnto them, they saw that they were retired vnto a place both by art and nature most strong: and therefore were let passe without any more annoyance. Wherefore I say, that with the fauour of the seate, and quality of the countrey, the dislodgement may be thus assured; as by the aboue recited examples may appeare.<note place="margin">

                           </note> for the remouing by day, without the great helpe and securitie of the seate, most commonly is very daungerous; except the Remouer should farre abound in Cauallery; and therefore the Campe, which is inferiour in horse, ought to distant himselfe, as farre as he can, from the enemy; for not, by such accidents, to be constrained either to fight vpon disaduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, or commit some other foule disorder.</p>

                     <p>He must conferre also with the Maister of the victuals to know how the store is furnished, that conuenient prouision may be made in time. The like care must

he haue with the Maister of the Ordinance for the supplying his store of muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as occasions and seruices of importance shall require.</p>
                     <p>He must know also of the Muster-maister, how the bands be furnished; what souldiers be dead or slaine; when, and how many; and how, and when supplied: deliuering pay to euery Colonell and Captaine accordingly, keeping the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants or notes of their hands for his discharge, and to aduise well the Muster-mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster to haue a good regard to the false Musters that many times be made, to the hinderance of the action, and abusing of the Prince: a fault ouer much vsed, and litle regarded.</p>
                     <p>He is moreouer to conferre with the Captaine Generall of the Artillerie, which is our Maister of the Ordinance, to know whether hee hath any billes from the Colonels and Captaines for powder and other munition receiued; that the same may be deducted at the day of pay.</p>

Finally, I haue here before you set downe first, the figure of the sayd broad square of men, or Battell in proportion of inequalitie, as 2 vnto 1, which commeth to containe, neare the iust quadrat of ground, girdled round about with 7 rankes of shot; and the rest of the shot, and short weapon due to this number and proportion of pikes, are deuided into sundry troupes of 50, in euery troupe, trouping round about the maine Battell; as I haue done before in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the iust square of men. I haue here also desseigned in figure the said broad square or hearst Battell, deuided into sundry battallions of that kinde, as first into 3 battallions, then into 5 battallions, as in page 212 may appeare: each battal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion is girdled with 3 rankes of shot; the rest of the shot and short weapon belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging vnto the sayd numbers, may bee placed in sundry small troupes, as is in the broad square, trouping round about the same: or as the Sergeant Maior shall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise thinke good: or as the ground will permit, or occasions offered to fight.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ere next will I set down the Tables and figures of sundry euen Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallions, as by 3, 5, or 7. euen battallio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: the which are very strong of themselues; yet neuerthelesse may you chuse whether you will fight in the same order of battallions, or, by marching them vp shoulder to shoulder, bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into a two, or threefold battell, at your owne discretion, or as occasion shall best serue. The number of which seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall battallions you shall finde (as I sayd before) placed in the Tables of squares of men, or battels in proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of equalitie, on the right side of euery leafe, by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your finger downe the first columne of the same, and then considering what number of pikes you haue whereof to deuide your battallions, you shall finde in the 4 columne of your euen battallions, the same number set downe, or a number vnder the same, which (I thinke good) you rather chuse then the iust number, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you may then cast out some remaines to imploy otherwise; for better it is to leaue then to lacke. As for example; here in these Tables of euen battallions, first there is set downe 3 euen battallions containing in each 49 pikes, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing summed together doe make 174 as appeareth in page. 225. Now turne vnto the first table of battels in proportion of equalitie, or euen squares of men, &amp; loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the first columne of the right side thereof, there shal you find in page 207 the said number of 49, whose square roote is 7: for 7 multiplied in it self is 49: &amp; 7 men &amp; 7 ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks is the square of euery of the said 3 Battallio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. And in this sort shal you find the order &amp; setting of all the other Battallions, and of all the other num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: as in these figures next ensuing of 3 Battallions, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taining in each 3364 me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whose square roote is 58, so is each Battallion of 58 rankes, &amp; 58 men per ranke: and the whole summe of all these 3 Battallions do amount 10092 pikes, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in these Tables following in page. 225.</p>

And although you haue beene a long time busied in these discourses, at our request, yet let vs entreate you to aunswere some more questions and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundes, which yet we haue in mind to propound,<note place="margin">

                     </note> for that we would willingly be instructed, in as much as should seeme needfull to a souldier; for we gather by your discourses, that this our age would so require it.</p>
                  <p>First, therefore we would gladly know the order to bee obserued to measure, only with going pases, a plat or peece of ground to martiall your men to fight, or set a battell thereupon.</p>

                     </note> and 200 foote in bredth. And now if you will set the front of your horse battell vpon the length of the sayd ground, which is 250 foote, then deuide the 250 by 5 foote of breadth (as before is sayd to allow for euery horse his station in breadth of ground 5 foote) and it produceth 50 horses in ranke; and then to know how many rankes they will bee, deuide the 20 foote, by 10 foote (as aboue is allowed for the length in ground of euery horse his station, or roome) and it produceth 20 rankes, at 50 horsemen <hi>per</hi> ranke, as in the figure following shall appeare.</p>
                  <figure/>
                  <p>And finally to know how many horsemen (after the former calculation) will serue to imbattell vpon the sayd seate of ground, you shall multiply the 50 horse by 20 rankes,<note place="margin">

And to conclude, hauing these rules perfectly in memory, and being well practised with your going pases, you may imbattell any number of men according to the seate or ground, with either foote, or horse; or with both, as occasion shall serue, and the quality of

            <head>A Table, shevving the signification of sundry forraine words, vsed in these discourses.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, for as much as in these Military discourses, I haue vsed some words and termes, somwhat straunge vnto such as haue not frequented forraine warres, nor haue anie great insight in forraine languages, I haue therefore thought good both to declare the signification of such words, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to shew my reasons for vsing the same.</p>
            <p>First you are to vnderstand that most of our termes now vsed in warres are deriued from straungers; as the French, the Italian, the Spaniard and the Dutch; wherin euery one almost haue their seuerall pronuntiation; therefore I hold it good, to vse such war termes and words, as we do borrow from straungers (as most languages doe borrow some, more or lesse, one of another) neare after the same nature, orthographie &amp; accent, as those nations do, from whom they are deriued: and not to pronounce and vse them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer corruptly, as we commonly doe. As for example. The word <hi>Caporall,</hi> which is a meere Italian, and also vsed by the French, we corruptly do both write and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce <hi>Corporall</hi>: for <hi>Caporall</hi> doth signifie the head and chiefe of a squadra, or small company of souldiers: and is an officer ensigning and gouerning (in his degree) the sayd company: and is in Spanish more aptly called <hi>Cabo de esquadra</hi> which is the head of a small squadra of 20 or 25 souldiers. And againe, wee vse both to pronounce and write, <hi>Core de guard</hi>; which by the French is written <hi>Corps de guard,</hi> and by the Italian and Spaniard, <hi>Corpo de guardia</hi>; which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the body of a watch: the which French or Italian word I haue rather vsed in my writing, then our corrupt English terme. Moreouer wee both pronounce and write the word <hi>Canuasada,</hi> the which (in truth) ought to be written and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced Camisada, being a Spanish tearme; and doth signifie the inuesting a shirt ouer the soldiers apparell or armour; the which is vsed in the night time when any suddaine exploit or peece of seruice is to be put in practise vpon the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, vnexpected or vnseene: to the end, that in the darkenesse of the night, the attempters may thereby the better one know and discerne another. These few words and termes, I suppose sufficient for my reasons. And for the signification of all other straunge and forraine words by me vsed, I will here following parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly set downe, in order of alphabet, as I shall call them to memory.</p>
