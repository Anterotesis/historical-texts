         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

speaking things which in my own Conscience I knew to be very

Declaration how I was drawn into this wicked Action. But
being very well satisfied that I shall create my self many pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
Enemies upon this account, I have retired my self to a
place of safety; where I will with my own hand discover the
great wrong that hath been done the Catholicks, and hope it
may gain belief. And likewise I protest before Almighty God,
that I have no Motive to induce me to this Confession, but a
true Repentance for the Mischiefs I have done; and hope God
Almighty will forgive me.</hi> And that the said <hi>Iohn Tasbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi>

               <hi>Then</hi> Roger Belwood <hi>
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> of Counsel for the King in this

            </p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Belwood.</speaker>
               <p>May it please your Lordship, and you
Gentlemen of the Jury, The Defendants <hi>Iohn Tasborough,</hi>
and <hi>Anne Price,</hi> stand Indicted for subornation of Perjury.
And the Indictment sets forth, That whereas <hi>Thomas
Whitebread, William Harcourt,</hi> and others, were Indicted,
and that for Treason, in Conspiring the Death of the
King, and other Treasons, and were legally Tryed, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed,
and Attainted for the same; and that <hi>Richard
Langhorn</hi> was likewise Indicted and Attainted for the same
Offence: And that upon these Tryals Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> was
produced and examined as a Witness for the King, and did
depose materially against the said Traytors; and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants
knowing this, and contriving and designing to
stifle the Discovery of the Treasons aforesaid, did before
the Tryal of the said <hi>Harcourt,</hi> sollicit, suborn, and endeavour
to perswade the said Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> not to be a Witness, nor
to give Evidence upon the Tryal: And after the Tryal,
did farther sollicite him to retract and deny all the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
he had given on that behalf, and promised him large
Rewards, and great Sums of Money for it; and to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish
this, they did incite him to withdraw and retire him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and produced a Note which he was to sign, and which
hath been read to you, wherein he was to acknowledge that
he was in an Errour, and had sworn falsely, and therefore
had retired himself, and for this they promised him great
Rewards. And this Offence is laid to be done falsely, advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly,
corruptly, and against the duty of their Allegiance.
To this the Defendants have pleaded Not Guilty: if we
shall prove the Fact upon them, we hope you will find it.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:53476:5"/>Then Mr. Serjeant <hi>Maynard</hi> pursued the Charge.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Serj. Maynard.</speaker>
               <p>My L<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. and you the Gentlemen of the
Jury, I am of Counsel in this Cause against the Defendants.
For the Fact that is laid in the Indictment, it consists of these
particulars. First, an attempt to prevent the Evidence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was given. And Secondly, when it was given, and
the Traytors were Convicted and Condemned, then to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
that Evidence, and the proceedings at Law that hath
been against the Traytors; and this in favour of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiks.
Thirdly, the means they used to perswade him,
which was by corrupt promises and engagements to him.
And Fourthly, That they had prepared a Note which hath
been read to the Jury, whereby he that had swore the
Truth, should publickly own to the world that he had swore
a Lye, and that the Catholicks had received great injury
by him, and that he had withdrawn himself to make this
Discovery: and this is the substance of the Charge upon
these persons. This practice, my Lord, is not new, it
hath appeared here in several other instances. We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
what <hi>Reading</hi> did, and we have not forgotten
what <hi>Knox</hi> and <hi>Lane</hi> did; and this is the third Cause of that
kind that hath come before you. Our Evidence will be
this: we shall produce Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> the Person a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
whom this Design was laid, and he can testifie all
this matter. Now he was but a single person against these
two Tempters; and your Lordship remembers what was
said in the like Case, two might convince one, and therefore
he thought it safe to acquaint, and he did acquaint per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of Publick Concern and Authority with this Attempt
upon him. And he did not onely this, but they met se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
times about it at the Tavern, and there we shall
prove what they did. Part of this hath been confessed,
for this hath had another Examination in another place.
And the Gentlewoman hath confessed, that she did offer
him Sums of Money, for it we will call our Witnesses.
We shall not now aggravate the fault, that will come after
the Evidence given; but I think it is hellish enough if it be
proved.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Then Mr. Atturney General proceeded to open the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <sp>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:53476:5"/>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, This Case is of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with those that Mr. <hi>Serjeant</hi> hath mentioned of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi>
and <hi>Knox</hi> and <hi>Lane;</hi> but it goes somewhat farther:
for this must be done in Writing, and subscribed by the
Partie, to be produced upon occasion, to defame all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
that had been given before. And the substance of
the Note is to Recant all that he had said, and aver it to be
false: and so all that have died upon that account, must
have been supposed to have died very unjustly. This was
the designe of the matter: And it was not onely in this
Case that these persons have been endeavouring things of
this nature; for we can prove, if it be necessary, by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Witness, that this Gentlewoman hath been tampering
to perswade him to retract his Evidence against another
person, one Mr. <hi>Parsons</hi> a Priest in custody; and to bring
all about, she did presume upon Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s old acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with her. They had been Fellow-servants in my Lord
<hi>Aston</hi>'s Family, and by that means were of antient acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:
And she did presume upon these grounds, that she
could withdraw him from all his Evidence. And we shall
prove, I think, by another Witness which does fortifie this
Testimony, that both these persons have already acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
this Fact, and that they personated great persons
in it; that is, they pretended to come in the name of very
great persons, as you will hear, when they had nothing to
do in the thing. They pretended to go to <hi>Windsor</hi> for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
and assurances of protection, and they have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
it; and 'tis in proof that they were never near that
person; that is, Mrs. <hi>Price</hi> did pretend she should go down
to <hi>Windsor</hi> and speak with the D. of <hi>York;</hi> for he was the
person named, though 'tis acknowledged, and was in proof
by her Companion, that she never came near him; that is,
by Mrs. <hi>Harris,</hi> of whom you will hear anon. And Mr. <hi>Tas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi>
did pretend the same thing to Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> and did
acknowledge it to the Council, but denyed that it was
true. We shall call our Witnesses, and prove the Fact as
it hath been opened.</p>

I do confess it was not done; but I was to go into the
Country into <hi>Stafford-shire,</hi> and just as I was going to
take Coach, she sent a Messenger to me to speak with me
before I went. I said I could not stay to speak with
her that morning; but I would remember her Business
when I came to Town again. I supposed it to be this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Mr. <hi>Parsons.</hi> I went into <hi>Stafford-shire,</hi> and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
there about six or seven weeks: I was there at the Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes

at one Mr. <hi>Crosses</hi> (where we usually met) to enquire when
I came to Town; and did desire <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

I came to Mr. <hi>Crosses</hi> that very Night, and they told me
of this, That Mrs. <hi>Price</hi> had been there several times to
request them, that when ever I came she might have No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.
I denied it that Night: I am very weary said I,
and therefore would not have her sent for. Within two

for; I cannot tell whether by my direction, or whether

back to give Evidence for them. I was to take the Plot
off from the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> and to lay it wholly upon the
Protestants. I was to swear against some persons, as
Mr. <hi>Tasborough</hi> told me, that after I was got on Shipboard,
I was to do a great deal of more Service, and come to swear
against a great Person, a Person of Considerable Note whom

there was no body but we tow together, I think at that
time: But I went to that Noble Lord my Lord <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:53476:8"/>
and acquainted him and Mr. <hi>Hambden,</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Charlton</hi> with it: For she threatned, that all the King's
Evidence would in a short time be hang'd; and if I would
come over to them, it should all be turned upon the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants.
The Duke had a wise Council, and had contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it so, that if I would come over to them, there would
not be a Papist that should suffer more; but their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
should be established in half a year, and all the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
brought to condign Punishment. When I acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
these persons I named with this, &amp; communicated it
to them, they thought fit I should go on a little with her
to trepan her, to see what kind of Plot it was they were
designing; and I did give Encouragement; but not so
far as to set my Hand to any Paper. But when it did
come out, the Contrivance they spoke of did prove Mr.
<hi>Dangerfield</hi>'s Plot, as appeared afterwards. So, as I was
saying, I did encourage this to <hi>Mrs. Price,</hi> to see what I
could get out of her; for I knew their Plots were dangerous
and barbarous when I was amongst them; but I never
designed to prosecute them at any Bar, but only to know
the depth of their Contrivance. And these Gentlemen
thought it very fit I should have some Evidence to testifie for
my Innocency, if they should prosecute me: And <hi>I</hi> did get
two persons, one Dr. <hi>Chamberlain</hi> and his Clerk who were
to be in a private place to over hear what was the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
between us; and when <hi>I</hi> had placed them, <hi>I</hi>
asked <hi>Mrs. Price,</hi> whether <hi>I</hi> first began the Tampering or
She, she answered she did, and <hi>I</hi> reckoned up all the Heads
of our former Treaties, though not the Particulars.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Mrs. Price</hi> had it from me, and produced
it before <hi>Mr. Tasborough</hi>'s Face.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Chief Justice.</speaker>

               <speaker>Mr. Dugdale.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Tasborough</hi> did read it, and reading
it said, this is nothing but what you may lawfully do; there
is no hurt in it?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Chief Justice.</speaker>

               <speaker>Mr. Dugdale.</speaker>
               <p>Then <hi>Mrs. Price,</hi> after some importunity

to copy out. And <hi>Mr. Tasborough</hi> and <hi>Mrs. Price</hi>
at the second meeting told me, that was the last time of
meeting, and if <hi>I</hi> did not then sign it, it would be much
to my prejudice; and that they should not be able to
do any thing for my advantage, if <hi>I</hi> did not sign it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Duke went into <hi>Scotland.</hi> He was then going,
and it should be much for my Benefit if I signed it first;

               <p>Yes, but I gave it her again before we

Lord, we have miss'd one thing about <hi>Mrs. Price.</hi> When
she was perswading me, she made use of the D. of <hi>York</hi>'s

the Duke that I should have my Pardon: Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly

brought me word back again, that the Duke did not
seem to countenance it much, for fear he should be drawn
into a <hi>Praemunire</hi> himself; and then she told me the Duke
did wish her to acquaint the <hi>Spanish</hi> Embassador with
it; and she did go and acquaint him with it, as she told
me. <hi>I</hi> asked her when <hi>I</hi> shou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

could not speak <hi>English,</hi> and it was not safe to
trust an Interpreter that they did not know; and so it
was to be deferred a little longer; but she said, that he
would protect me, and that all that she said that the
Duke had promised for my Reward; and for my safe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
beyond Sea, he would be ready to do it; and she
told me, that the <hi>Spanish</hi> Embassador would write
Letters into <hi>Flanders.</hi> And so they made use of the

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Dugdale,</speaker>
               <p>Yes, for I made some scruples about it, for
they said before the Duke would believe me real, I must sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
the Note, which I would not do without further assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
She promised a person of good sufficiency and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
should engage for the performance, and one Mr. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi>
as she said was to be sent for, and was sent for out of the

said to Mrs. <hi>Price</hi> when a 1000 <hi>l</hi> was proposed, Lord in
heaven, that is too much money, a 100 <hi>l</hi> is enough to serve
me; said she, we must have a care how we manage this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
for she told me the D. of <hi>York</hi> stood upon a Tickle point,
and if it should be known the Duke tampered with the Kings
Witnesses it would ruin him, but she said a 1000 <hi>l</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for me if I would go beyond Sea into <hi>Flanders,</hi> where I
should be maintained and protected. But I objected my fear
of the Inquisition in <hi>Spain,</hi> which I knew to be so cruel a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53476:12"/>
thnig, therefore I would not go beyond sea. Then she asked me
if I would be contented with the Protection of a Protestant
Earl's house.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. I.</speaker>
               <p>When you said you were unwilling to go beyond

of a Protestant Earls house, and you desired to know
who it was, but she named no body?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. I. Pemberton,</speaker>
               <p>And you say when <hi>Mr. Tasborough</hi> came to

               <speaker>Mr. Dugdale,</speaker>
               <p>Yes, my Lord, and without I would sign the

               <speaker>Mr. Dugdale,</speaker>
               <p>No my Lord, but that second time, you may
see says he what a progress hath been made by the acquitting
of Sir <hi>Geo. Wakeman,</hi> even that the Protestants themselves are
at a stand about their belief, whether there be a Plot or no,
and if you come over to us it will overthrow all.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Dugdale,</speaker>
               <p>Said I, <hi>Mr. Price,</hi> suppose I should come
over to you, what would it advantage you? there is <hi>Mr. Oates,</hi>

               <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>And he said this I observe by the way, that if
he came over, all the King's Evidence should be hang'd, and
the Plot turned upon the Protestants.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. I. Pemberton,</speaker>
               <p>Yes he did say so, that he was told by the

               <p>But <hi>Mr. Tasborough</hi> perswaded him to sign

               <p>It was to desire him to be kind to Father <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi>

               <speaker>Mr. Wright,</speaker>
               <p>I asked him when he came out, what it was;

                  </gap>he
did further say, if the King should command me to be burnt

said <hi>Mr. Dugdale,</hi> while you give these kind expressions, yet

afterwards she came to tamper with him to do <hi>Harcourt</hi>

               <p>That is the thing, that she should say he was a

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Ser. Maynard,</speaker>
               <p>There was some love betwixt them, and
they did keep company together.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>This is before she began to tamper with
<hi>Mr. Dugdale,</hi> but that we call this Witness to prove is, that she
did afterwards tamper with him as <hi>Mr. Dugdale</hi> tells you.</p>

                  <hi>L.</hi> Ch. I.</speaker>
               <p>And the thing <hi>I</hi> say is, would she go to tamper

so, but it is not likely.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>It is not impossible nor improbable at all with

that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he thought would be so?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Iust. Pemberton,</speaker>
               <p>She thought as all the other Catholicks
did, and did desire to withdraw him from his Evidence
against them.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. I. Dolben,</speaker>
               <p>And notwithstanding that she called him
Rogue, yet still the Witness says, he thought there was mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of love between them.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>

               <speaker>Mr. I. Pemberton,</speaker>
               <p>It was about a matter that concerned the
whole Catholick party, and if you ask them they will call
them all Rogues. But afterwards they will begin to tamper
one with one, and another with another.</p>

and we did hear him. At length Mrs. <hi>Price</hi> came, the
Gentlewoman I had never seen, but he called her by that
name, and she answered to it. They had several discourses,
<hi>I</hi> could not overhear all, but the sum was that the Spanish
Embassador was unwilling to treat with him, because it
was dangerous, and he must make use of an Interpreter,
and that the Duke of <hi>York</hi> would protect him, pardon
him and give him a thousand pound to maintain him:
You know says he, Mrs. <hi>Price,</hi> that <hi>I</hi> began not this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue

                     </gap>e</hi> came. We shut up our
selves in the Closset, and desired Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> to make a feigned
discourse to see whether we could hear him, and he did so, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53476:16"/>
we heard indifferently well. We bid him to speak a little loud that
we might be sure to hear him. We staid there almost half an hour
before she came. Afterwards she came up and Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> saluted
her by the name of Mrs. <hi>Price,</hi> to which she answered. He asked
her, When shall I go to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassadors? [This I heard
distinctly; for I could see her body, but not her face, she stood with
her back to the door] 'Tis not convenient at present, said the, to go;
for his Interpreter is out of Town. Then Mrs. <hi>Price</hi> was saying, If
so be you will come over to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and take off your
Evidence, you shall have 1000 <hi>l.</hi> secured to you: but how,
said he? Said she, I will bring to you in a weeks time a person of
Quality that shall secure and confirm it to you.</p>

               <p>That will be well, said Mr. <hi>Dugdale;</hi> I had rather do
that way than any other. Said she, you shall have the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s
protection, and a pardon not only for your body, but for your soul.</p>

               <p>No, my Lord; the Duke was named indeed,

him to speak softly; and then Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> was so honest, that he
repeated it over again, that if we had not heard him before, we
might understand him.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I do remember Mrs. <hi>Price</hi> when
she was asked who it was that framed the paper for her, (because it
seemed to the Lords as if it had been a thing so very well framed,
that it was beyond a womans capacity to do it). Mrs. <hi>Price</hi> said, that
she studied it her self, and indicted it her self; and one Mrs. <hi>Man</hi> as I
think, writ it out for her; but she took it upon her self that she had
studied it (that particular word) and contrived it.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I do also remember that Mr. <hi>Tas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi>

this paper—</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>

               <p>I verily believe it was. It was read to him.
<hi>Mr. Tasborough</hi> did speak very cautiously, and as prudently as he could
in the matter. He did not positively say he had pressed <hi>Mr. Dugdale</hi>
to sign it; but did tell <hi>Mr. Dugdale,</hi> That unless he did sign it, he
could not proceed to get him any favour, for that was to be the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Saunders.</speaker>
               <p>May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen
of the Jury, I am of Counsel for Mrs. <hi>Price,</hi> that is one of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants
in this Indictment, which as hath been opened, does set forth,
That she did contrive to suborn the Kings Evidence before the Trials
of those persons, and to suppress it; and afterwards to retract the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
given, and go off from what before he had sworn, to dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
the Justice of the Realm, and to make it be believed that those
persons who were condemned and executed for this Conspiracy, were
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53476:18"/>
innocent, and had wrong done them by him. Now for that matter,
that which we have to offer for her is this: Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Price</hi>
were fellow servants in my Lord <hi>Aston</hi>'s Family, and there they did
contract a more than ordinary familiarity, for in truth they did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
a marriage, and Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> did promise her marriage; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> having some other design, did desert her, and
she came to <hi>London,</hi> and lived here; but afterwards when he came
up to <hi>London,</hi> he thought fit to renew his suit, and did not only send
for her when he first came to <hi>London,</hi> but we have it in proof, that
from time to time he had continually sent for her, and would not be
quiet without her; and when she denied to come upon his sending in
his own name, he sent in another womans name, whom he knew to be
an acquaintance of hers; and thus there continued all along a great
intimacy between them, insomuch that several persons, and amongst
them one of the Kings Witnesses, did observe they were speaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
marrying, and did think they did intend to be married in a short
time: my Lord, what discourse might pass between them, I don't
know; for ought I perceive she is proved to be a Papist, and 'tis
very like she would sollicite one with whom she had that familiarity,
for those of her own party, as much as she could; but as far as I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
by this evidence that hath been given, he under colour of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and pretence that he would marry her, and sending for her
from time to time; at last ro rid his hands of her, hath put this up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her, That she should sollicite to suborn him against his Conscience
to withdraw his Evidence; she is a kind of weak Solicitrix for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of judgment and reason; I know not what other prevalency she
might have with him by any other thing; but for judgment I think—</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
               <p>If she penn'd that her self, as she did acknowledg and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow
she did, she was a woman of good judgment certainly.</p>

               <p>Alas! alas! this is such a design indeed of

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Saunders.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> hath sworn, That this was her Intrigue,
and she first began with him; if Mrs. <hi>Price</hi> be admitted to swear
who is the Defendant, as well as Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> who is the prosecutor,
she would tell you that Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> did contrive this matter himself.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>She would destroy his Evidence that way,
that is very well.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Just. <hi>Dolben.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Chamberlain</hi> and his Clerks both swear, that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53476:18"/>
he told her, <hi>You know it was not I begun this Intrigue, but you.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Saunders.</speaker>
               <p>And if she had had but so much wit to have plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
witnesses to have taken advantage of his words, she had counter-worked
him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Iust. Pemberton.</speaker>
               <p>They will learn such ways soon enough of

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Saunders.</speaker>
               <p>If you please we will go on with our Evidence, and
call witnesses to prove, that <hi>Mr. Dugdale</hi> had contracted himself to
her in marriage; and this is a very unkind ill thing in him to serve
us thus.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Iust. Pemberton.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Saunders,</hi> you ought to remember <hi>publica
privatis,</hi> &amp;c. A man should prefer the publick good and safety of the
Nation before such a mistress as this is.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Iust. Dolben.</speaker>
               <p>But hitherto the proof runs, that she sought
him, and not he her.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Saunders.</speaker>
               <p>But they were contracted first.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Iust. Dolben.</speaker>
               <p>And you hear what the master of the Horseshoe
says about her leaving messages for him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Iust. Pemberton.</speaker>
               <p>He hath very good reason why he should not
marry her, for what I can perceive.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis much they should be contracted, when she told him
he was a great Rogue.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Saunders.</speaker>
               <p>It may be she might; I know not what cause he hath
now to be displeased with her; but it may be she might be displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with him then. But I beseech your Lordship and the Jury to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
that though she did tell him he was a Rogue, yet it was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
that she did solicite and suborn him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Iust. Pemberton.</speaker>
               <p>And therefore she thought plainly he was
fitter for her purpose, because she took him for a Rogue.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Saunders.</speaker>
               <p>But if she had a purpose to suborn him, she would
not call him Rogue to his face; that was not the way to insinuate
into him. I desire Sir <hi>Iohn Nicholas</hi> may be sworn</p>
            </sp>
            <p>[which was done].</p>
            <sp>

               <p>I desire, my Lord, Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> would tell us, whether
<hi>Mr. Dugdale</hi> in his hearing did not own he was contracted to <hi>Mrs. Price?</hi>

               <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
               <p>What great inference can you make from that? methinks
'tis as much against you as it is for you; for it proves there was a
great familiarity and frequent meetings between them; and if it be
so, it shews as if she had that great confidence in him, as to attempt
upon, and attack him in this affair.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Justice <hi>Pemberton.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Indeed Mr. <hi>Saunders,</hi> if you would have
proved an Inducement to <hi>Mr. Dugdales</hi> Evidence, you could not have
proved it better, that she had a great Confidence in him; she had
an opinion, and reckoned he was sure to her, and so had a greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence over him than another.</p>

               <p>Now, my Lord, if you please, we will go on
to prove. That when she refused to come, he sent for her in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Saunders.</speaker>
               <p>It is not probable then that she should sollicit
him. And just at the last here are some Witnesses planted, and
some words are taken from her mouth, that it was her Intrigue
all along.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
               <p>It shews that which they have proved, that she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
he was fond of her, and she was confident of him.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>I suppose Mr. <hi>Saunders</hi> means, and does
drive at this, to shew that it was to drive on the Intrigue on his
part, that these frequent Messages were sent.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Then another Woman Witness was called and sworn.</p>

               <p>My Lord, at the time that the Proclamation was for

coming into the House, I was in the passage, he asked me,

where Mistris <hi>Price</hi> was? I told him I could not tell: I wish
said he, you would fetch her to me: No, said I, I would not
do it for five Shillings: He clapped his hand in his Pocket, and
said he, I will give you five Shillings: No, said I, I will not
do it if you would give me five Pound, <hi>let every Tub stand upon

they should perswade Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> not to give Evidence against

they should endeavour to perswade Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> to Retract the
Evidence he had formerly given for a Sum of Mony, and other
Rewards, We do Reckon, that as this Evidence stands before
your Lordships, whatsoever is proved against M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

we must distinguish the Evidence as it stands, or else it may

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Iustice Pemberton.</speaker>
               <p>At the first meeting the Note was

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
               <p>No, I think not.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Iustice Dolben.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, my Lord, it was.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
               <p>Was it Mr. <hi>Dugdale?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Dugdale.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, my Lord.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Pollexfen.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, he does Swear so, and that he Read
it, and press'd Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> to Sign it; And that this was the
last time, and it must be done before the Duke went into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
or something to that purpose. This, my Lord, under fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
may all stand and be very true, and yet <hi>Mr. Tasborough</hi>
not Criminal, with Submission: for if so be Mr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Price</hi> were so
far in her intercourse with M. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> that as appears by his
own Evidence he did seem to comply and Treat, as if he were
yielding, and to do what they would have him do, concerning
his going beyond Seas, or being kept in a Protestant Lords
House, and she had such Confidence as to tell him how the
Priests were sent away, and how he might be conveyed away.
All this thus far comes to agree with what Mr. <hi>Tasborough</hi> says
for his own Defence: For Mr. <hi>Tasborough</hi> says, M. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Price</hi>
did tell me, that Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> was sorry for what he had
Sworn, and would Retract all the Evidence he had formerly
given. Thus he says: I'll apply it to our Case anon; and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53476:22"/>
this appears by Mr. <hi>Dugdales</hi> own Evidence: for when he does
Repeat what Mr. <hi>Tasborough</hi> told him, he says, that he said,
Mrs. <hi>Price</hi> told him of it, and he hath not told you, that he did
contradict it for false.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Iustice Pemberton.</speaker>
               <p>Pray consider, he tells you, that
<hi>Tasborough</hi> said, that M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s. <hi>Price</hi> had acquainted him, with
what Propositions she had made of 1000 <hi>l.</hi> and that he was the
man that was come to confirm the Promises She had
made</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
               <p>That presses you, that is the truth of it. If that
had not been in the case, perhaps you don't talk much out of
the way. 'Tis true, your Observation is right.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
               <p>When <hi>Tasborough</hi> comes into the Company to be
acquainted with <hi>Dugdale,</hi> at that time M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Dugdale</hi> had been
advised to comply, or seem to do so to find out the Plot and
Design, and what he could get out by it. And without Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
to pursue that end, he did shew yieldingness; and as you
observe, for ought <hi>Tasborough</hi> knew, she might be sincere: But
was it a good way for him to tell him? there is the matter in
effect, he does tell him so. If you will Retract your Evidence
according to this Note that was produced by her, and read by
him, you shall have 1000 <hi>l.</hi> for your paines, Can you answer
that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Iustice Pemberton.</speaker>
               <p>Or can you Answer th'other, that
he should say, She hath Acquainted me what you propose,
that is, That you would Retract all, and go out of the way,
and be no more an Evidence; and if you would do that, that
she hath Acquainted me with her Proposition, which I come to
Confirm, that she would give you 1000 <hi>l.?</hi> What can be
made of that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Iustice Dolben.</speaker>
               <p>And withall, formerly there was a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of some person of Quality that should come to him: he
desired that some such one should be a Security for the money,
and afterwards she brought Mr. <hi>Tasborough,</hi> and said, That was
the Gentleman she told him of.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Iust. Pemberton.</speaker>
               <p>Come, <hi>Mr. Pollexfon,</hi> take this
too, What had Mr. <hi>Tasborough</hi> to do to use the Duke of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53476:23"/>
                  <hi>York's</hi> Name? And to say, That he had Authority from him
to propose these things, which certainly is a very great wrong
to so great a Prince.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
               <p>That needed not to a penitent person, that was
sorry for what he had done.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Pollexfen.</speaker>
               <p>He does indeed say, That <hi>Mr. Tas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi>
should be the man that should secure the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Sol. General.</speaker>
               <p>And there is one thing farther, to take in
all that <hi>Mr. Tasborough</hi> did likewise say to <hi>Mr. Dugdale,</hi> That
there is no harm in doing this, that it is a very Charitable Act,
and that he would do well in it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
               <p>But they answer that, by saying, supposing it to be
true, that <hi>Dugdale</hi> had Remorse, then it would be a very
good Action, but to Talke of 1000 <hi>l.</hi> to be given for it, there
is the Crime.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Pollexfen.</speaker>
               <p>Whether my Answer will take with your
Lordship or no, I can't tell; but the Answer I would give
is this; There are several things in that Paper, as amongst
the rest, That he should fall under great dislike, and danger,
and therefore was forced to hide and secure himself for fear
of those whom he should make his Enemies by it, and that
was terror enough to any man that should run into such a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction.
Therefore now he must live when he hath done
this, and so we should apply the other part of the Discourse,
whatever Money she had promised to take off his Fears of
Want, and so his coming there was to make good that part of
the Paper, which says, he must be protected and maintained,
and preserved, that he may see he hath a subsistance and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
for him, if he did deserve it. And, my Lord, it will be
greatly distinguishing in our Case, and turn much upon this
point, with submission, if I give or offer money to any man
to Swear a Falshood or Retract the Truth, 'tis a very
great Crime, and if we are Guilty of that, undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
our Crime is very bad; but in order to the bringing
of Truth to discovery, and to have a Retraction not of
a truth but of a falshood, and to preserve that Witness
from perishing, I may promise him protection and subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Sergeant Maynard.</speaker>
               <p>Then you have found out a better
way then the Devil himself could have suggested to uphold Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
               <p>Upon my Word, if that were a way that were
allowable, then woe be to us, we should easily have all the
Witnesses tampered with by the Temptation of 1000 <hi>l.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
Do you think that is a good thing, for a Man to say,
This thing was rashly said, if you will unsay't, you shall have
such a Reward. People would be apt to bite at such a Bait,
and we do not live in so Vertuous an Age, that 1000 <hi>l.</hi> will
not Tempt a Man to unsay what he hath said at first, though
what he said then was true.</p>

               <p>Nay Mr. <hi>Pollexfen,</hi> consider, these
things must not be done by any one; their way, if they had
been convinced of the Truth, had been to have carryed the
Complaint to a Magistrate, and there to detect him by what
he had said: not to Corrupt him, and persist in it, by telling
him, if he would do so and so, he should have 1000 <hi>l.</hi> By this

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Thompson.</speaker>
               <p>my Lord, Will you please to spare me one word
for Mr. <hi>Tasborough;</hi> I confess the Evidence does seem by Mr. <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi>
to press us very hard, and particularly upon that matter of
the money, but as Mrs. <hi>Price</hi> had managed the business, Mr. <hi>Tas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi>
might have been very innocent. But, My Lord, we must
make that defence for our selves that we can in a Case of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and therefore it will be, I hope, no reflection to say, We
must counterprove Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> and disprove him as far as we
can, to acquit our selves. My Lord, it is a very great Crime that
we are here charged with; and the Crime being so hainous,
ought to be well proved, and with unquestionable Evidence.
Mr. <hi>Tasborough,</hi> if he be Guilty of what he is here accused of, is
a very ill man; but men are not drawn up to great degrees of
illness so soon, as at the first act to attempt such hainous Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
And 'tis not probable that at his first slip he should be
Guilty of a fault of so high a Nature, and so very ill as this is.
My Lord, We shall call some persons that shall make it appear
to your Lordship, that after Mrs. <hi>Price</hi> had given us information
of this repentance of Mr. <hi>Dugdale's,</hi> We did make application to a
Person of very great Honour, no less than my <hi>Lord Privy Seal,</hi> that
Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> might receive the discouragement which it was fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
he should in such a matter. My Lord, we must call our Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
to prove Mr. <hi>Tasborough</hi> to be a man of a very good repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
that he never did any such thing before; and I hope, We
shall give your Lordship such an account of him, that the Jury
will have reason to believe, That Mr. <hi>Tasborough</hi> is not so Guilty
as he is represented; but was drawn into this matter what ever it
is. Pray call a Witness to shew that Mr. <hi>Tasborough</hi> acquainted
any Lord of the Privy Council.</p>

day, because I was to come to my Tryal. He told me, he had
business that would hinder him from coming; but, said he, if

you said it was how you were brought acquainted with Mr. <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale;</hi>
but because the Court did not think fit to put off the Tryal,
Mr. Attorney did say he would see if he had been examined, and
what he had deposed, and report it to us, and afterwards did so,

his Examination if you pleased; but we do not see that you

               <p>Well, come Mrs. what will you say? But we
must tell the Jury before-hand it signifies nothing for Evidence.</p>
            </sp>

                  <hi>Mrs.</hi> Price.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> does here accuse me of suborning
him to retract his Evidence. I do protest 'tis so far from it, that he
importuned me, and solicited me to go to the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and
he told me if I would go, he would pay my Coach-hire. Is it not
so Mr. <hi>Dugdale?</hi>
               </p>

               <speaker>Mr. Just. <hi>Dolben.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>The very first thing you have said hath
discredited all you would say; for if Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> (as you say) had
importuned you that you would do this thing for him, how
comes it to pass that afterwards you should promise him a reward
of 1000 <hi>l.</hi> and bring a Gentleman to make it good?</p>

               <p>Sir, under your favour, here hath
been a strange way of defence. Consider what a Crime we are
upon, and in what times we are. That there is a Plot of a very
high and transcendent Nature under Question, that divers Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
have been suborned, and persons tryed in this place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed
for it, 'tis undeniable. Now after Tryals for so high
a Crime in the most publick way, here come <hi>Price</hi> and <hi>Tasbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough;</hi>
what to do? she indeed before, but both <hi>Tasborough</hi> and she
afterwards, by Rewards, and such Temptations, Endeavours
to disgrace his Evidence, but there is not only that, but the great
thing looked after by their party, was, the Issue of it; upon this
all the King's Evidence were to be hang'd. What hath been
said is only to make a Jest, and make the Company merry, that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53476:28"/>
there was a Contract of Marriage between them, but what will
be the Consequence of that? He that spoke it, has unquestiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
proved the probability of our Charge, we have made it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
and he hath proved it; and the Inference drawn by them
is, She certainly did not tempt him, because she had an interest
in him, which concludes very naturally. But then for the other,
<hi>Mr. Tasborough,</hi> Alderman <hi>Barker</hi> comes in, and swears the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is a very honest man, I hope he did hear the Evidence,
and then I wonder how he could swear it; but do we come to
prove whether he be an honest man in his life? 'tis not at all our
question' if we should have offered to have disparaged him
in another way, we had not, I think, done our duty, and the
Court would justly have reproved us for it; but there is one
thing, which if it had not been spoken, I would have held my
peace: How is <hi>Tasborough</hi> concerned in the Case? Divers have
been questioned and executed for High Treason, upon Mr. <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi>'s
Evidence; and after such an Execution, what is Mr. <hi>Tasbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi>'s
duty? it hath been represented as if he had been perswaded
by her, and drawn in that way, and he thinking that it was a falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that had been sworn before, and that Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> repented of
the injury he had done them, he should help to make this disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.
But what was he concerned? did he go to a Justice of
Peace, or any just way? did he not contrive with the Devil rather
than the Justice? 1000 l. must be paid to daaw off a man,
and corrupt him, to make him own himself perjured, in a truth
that had been spoken. And this is not the first time that they
have done it; for we remember the Case of <hi>Reading,</hi> very well.
I shall say no more, but this, under favour, it is not well to say,
That a man may persuade another to deny his Testimony, that
is nothing concerned in the Case, in a case of this publick Nature
especially, and for money too, that was never meant by the
Law, and I hope is not meant ever to be countenanced here.
I hope the Court will give that Caution to all that hear it, as
will discourage any Attempts of this Nature for the future. And
that it shall not be enough to excuse it, for him to say he was
persuaded, and thought his sorrow was real, and thereby to
put the King's Witnesses to prove that thing to be true that they
had proved already. What had Mr. <hi>Tasborough</hi> to do, as if he
were a judge of the proceedings of the Court, and Witnesses?
Nothing at all, under favour, but is a very ill man, and as such
I hope shall be punished.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Iustice JONES.</speaker>
               <p>Gentlemen, You of the Iury:</p>
               <p>THese two Persons have been Indicted for a very
great Offence. The Indictment sets forth (that
which we all know to be true) that <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread,</hi>
and divers others, have been Tryed and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
for a very execrable <hi>Hellish, Popish Plot:</hi> That
upon these Indictments, Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> did give Material
Evidence; But that, when some other of the Conspirators
were to be Tryed, and brought to Punishment,
these two Persons did endeavour to make Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi>
absent himself, and retract his Evidence. And not only so,
when <hi>Harcourt</hi> was to be brought to his Tryal, (for
whom it seems Mrs. <hi>Price</hi> had a particular Kindness);
but likewise, it was endeavoured, he should be gone,
and not give any further Evidence at all; and he
should have a Thousand Pound for a Reward. This
is the Indictment.</p>
               <p>The Inducement to the Indictment (that is the Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
of the Conspirators) is all well known: And
there have been Coppies of the Records produced,
which have been inspected and per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sed by the Councel,
on the Defendants Parts; and they cannot say, but
that the Records agree with the Matter, in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect:
So that, there is nothing at all, but the bare
Matter of Fact, that you are to inquire into.</p>
               <p>I shall distinguish the Persons: Mrs. <hi>Price,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Evidence, hath gone through the whole
Charge of the Indictment; and indeed, hath committed
some further Crimes, than have been mentioned in the
Indictment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> It hath been proved to you by Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi>
that she did not only desire Kindness to <hi>Harcourt,</hi> who
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53476:29"/>
was her <hi>Ghostly-Father;</hi> but she did designe, as much
as in her lay, that he should not come in at all, to
give Evidence against him: This is proved by Mr. <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale;</hi>
And another Person that was by, that did hear
Mrs. <hi>Price</hi> say, She would have him be kind to Mr.
<hi>Harcourt,</hi> because he was her <hi>Ghostly-Father;</hi> With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
tells you, That immediately after, <hi>Dugdale</hi> did tell
him, that she did perswade him, he should absent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and not give Evidence against <hi>Harcourt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She is likewise Charged, (as they are both) that
she did treat with Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> for to Retract all that
he had said, to be gone, and to leave a Paper behind
him, which should signify, that there was Trouble of
Mind upon him; and that he had done wrong in his
Testimony, given against the <hi>Catholicks:</hi> Therefore, he
would be gone, and leave a Testimony of it in Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
when he was gone. And she provides for his Security
abroad, and he should have a <hi>Thousand pound</hi> Reward.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dugdale</hi> is the Person, with whom the first Treaty
was: But because he knew, and it was observed,
that it was unsafe to deal with Persons, that were
tampering with him in such a Nature as this was, and
upon a Matter of this kind; he does acquaint Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of very great Quality, as he swears; my Lord
of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and two other Persons. They do advise
him, that he should get some Persons to be by, when
they should come to some further Treaties concerning
this Business. And to that purpose, he should hold up
a Correspondence, and condescend to a kind of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
and Complyance, that he might be able to
have further Testimony, to confirm his Evidence.
Whereupon Dr. <hi>Chamberlaine,</hi> and his Servant, are placed
in a Closet in Mr. <hi>Dugdale's</hi> Chamber, in such a Place
that they might hear what was discoursed in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:
In comes Mrs. <hi>Price,</hi> they being in the Closet,
Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> and she discoursed about the Business so
loud, that Dr. <hi>Chamberlaine</hi> and his Servant (as both
of them tell you) heard their discourse upon it. The
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53476:29"/>
Question was asked, and put, to Mrs. <hi>Price: Mrs.</hi>
Price, <hi>I hope, you know, you are the Person that first moved
this Intrigue; it began from You, and not from M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>:</hi> And this
was confessed by her. So that you have, in Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> the Testimony both of Dr. <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlaine,</hi>
and of his Servant, to that part of the Charge
against her. And withall, 'tis added, not only that
he was to go beyond-Sea, to retract what Evidence he
had given; but likewise, it was thought expedient, he
should come over again, and swear against all the rest
of the Evidence that had been given, or should be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for the <hi>KING.</hi> And when it was said by Mr.
<hi>Dugdale,</hi> What will it avail you, if I do Retract my
Evidence? There is Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify
the same thing. She said, No matter for that:
If we get you on our side, for the <hi>Catholick</hi>-Cause, to

That, you may remember, was testifyed by some of
the Witnesses.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Price</hi> deals frequently with Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> to this
purpose.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dugdale,</hi> that he might know (and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> very like,
with that honest Intention, and no other, he did it)! and
that he might discover the Bottom of the Business, tells
her, This is a thing of dangerous Consequence; and
it is fit, that I have better Security, than your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of this Thousand Pound: I will have some Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
Person, that shall come and confirm what
you promise. And thereupon she tells him, He should
have a Substantial Person brought: and, he should have
Thanks from very great Persons; naming the <hi>Duke of
York:</hi> For he it was, as they said, that would take
care to Protect him, and procure a Pardon for him.</p>
               <p>Now, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> this is the Evidence against Mrs.
<hi>Price.</hi> In Defence of this, What does she o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>en, but
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53476:30"/>
that she hath been acquainted with Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> and
there hath been great Familiarity between them?
If there had not been such a Familiarity, would there
have been such an Intrigue? Is this a Matter to be
Communicated to a Stranger? If there were a Doubt
before, whether there were this Contrivance; Does not
this give us a better Assurance that it was so, because
there was such an Acquaintance between them?</p>
               <p>Then, as to Mr. <hi>Tasborough:</hi> He indeed is not in
the Beginning of the Designe, at all: There is no
Evidence against him, for that Part of the Charge, <hi>That
he should Absent himself, and not give Evidence against</hi> Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court.
He comes not in at that Time: Nor can I
perceive by Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> that he had any Acquaintance
with him at all, till the <hi>Twelfth</hi> of <hi>October.</hi> And he
sayes, he was but twice in his Company.</p>
               <p>Now, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> What does Mr. <hi>Tasborough</hi> do?
First, <hi>Dugdale</hi> is told by Mrs. <hi>Price,</hi> That a Man of
QUALITY should come to him, and confirm
all the Promises she had made him. <hi>Tasborough</hi> does
come to him, and tells him, He hath had some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
with Mrs. <hi>Price,</hi> what she had proposed; and
he is now come to make good and confirm, That all
shall be effected, that she had proposed to him.
Ay! but it is supposed, that Mr. <hi>Tasborough</hi> is a very
Honest Man, and a Conscientious Man; and does
come for nothing in the World, but to perswade Mr.
<hi>Dugdale</hi> to do the Office of a Christian: It was a
Charitable thing of him, to take off the Scandal that
was upon the Innocent. But you do not hear him
charge it upon Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s Conscience, that he had
given a false Evidence against any of those Persons;
nor urge him much to Repent: But he must begone:
He must give no more Evidence against the <hi>Catholicks:</hi>
And, What if he do comply with this Desire? Then
he tells him, he shall have a Reward; What Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward?
A thousand Pound; which was made known
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53476:30"/>
before; and Protection, and Pardon, and Security:
And he comes to him in the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Name, to
inforce it the more strongly upon him, and make
him do it: Whereas, indeed, the Duke of <hi>York</hi> (as he
himself, and Mrs. <hi>Price</hi> have since confessed) never
knew any thing at all of the Business.</p>
               <p>Now, Gentlemen, to move by honest Christian
means, any one that hath done an injury of any sort,
to Repentance, and Contrition, and Recantation, that
is a very good thing, but to do it with promise of a
Reward of a Thousand Pound, cannot be justified; what
way is there to insinuate into any Person, an intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of doing a Mischief, but such a way as this? Will
any one come to another, and say, forswear your self;
whereas you know such a thing to be true, swear it
to be false, or retract the Evidence you have given
about it, and I will give you a Thousand Pound?
No, but serve the <hi>Catholick</hi> Cause, a great many have
suffered, and by your Testimony; retract, be gone, be
secure; you shall have a certainty, that you shall be
secure in another Kingdom; or else you shall have it in
a <hi>Protestant</hi> Family, though neither that <hi>Protestant</hi> nor any
<hi>Protestant</hi> was named.</p>
               <p>Is not this a Bait to tempt a Man to all the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany
in the World? If a Thousand Pound be offered,
who can resist? Such People as these are, will not
easily resist such a Temptation.</p>
               <p>But, Mr. <hi>Tasborough</hi> is a very honest Man in his
Life and Conversation, he produceth those that tell
you his Reputation is good, and the like; there is
no doubt of it, and if he had produced Twenty Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
do you think he would produce any one that
should speak against himself? He chooses out those
certainly, as would speak as much in his Favour as
they can; but if a Man hath been an honest Man in
his Conversation, may he not be inticed or seduced?
Especially when it will be told him, if you do
this you shall merit Heaven; you shall be Sainted
and Canonized, you do the greatest service in the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53476:31"/>
World, to the <hi>Catholick</hi> Cause.</p>
               <p>These Temptations may work upon a Man, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
that is Morally honest, when he is infatuated with
this Principle, that any thing may be done for the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi>
Cause, as it is a <hi>Catholick</hi> Doctrine, too often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>still'd
into them, that any thing is become Sanctified,
when it tends to that end; 'tis easy then to prevail
upon them in things of this Nature.</p>
               <p>I should have told you, (which I omitted before)
one Circumstance concerning matter of proof against
Mrs. <hi>Price,</hi> more than <hi>Tasborough;</hi> two Witnesses said
they were in the Closet, and heard a Woman discourse;
but neither of them did see her Face; but afterwards it
is proved by another that he was desired to observe
who came into, or went out of the House; and he
swears, he saw Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> and her come out of the
House, that they went to the <hi>Gate-House;</hi> and he saw
her come again from the <hi>Gate-House</hi> with Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi>
and he is sure this is the Person. And you remember
that part of their discourse was of going to the <hi>Gate-House.</hi>
