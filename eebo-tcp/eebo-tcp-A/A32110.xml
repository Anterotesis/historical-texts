         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>MY Lords, and Gentlemen; nothing but extreame neceſſity ſhall make me willing at this time for to give conſent unto the Queenes going out of the Land; and I ſhall be very ſorry if the caſe ſtand ſo, that ſhe ſhould be forc't to goe to preſerve her health, and I give unto both Houſes many thanks, for the care they have of my Wives health and contentment: therefore I deſire there may be a Committee of both Houſes here to morrow, at three a clock, to attend my Wife, with theſe Reaſons which have now been read to me.</p>

               <head>The Reaſons of the Houſe of <hi>Commons,</hi> to ſtay the Queenes going into <hi>Holland:</hi>
               </head>
               <head type="sub">Delivered to the Lords, at a Conference the 14. of <hi>July,</hi> By <hi>John Pym</hi> Eſquire; And <hi>Delivered the</hi> 15. <hi>to his Majeſtie, in preſence of both Houſes by my Lord BANKES.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THere is great cauſe to doubt, leſt the Papiſts have ſome deſigne upon her Majeſties Journey, becauſe the Houſe hath beene informed, that divers of them have ſold off their Lands to a good value, and uſed other meanes to get ready money.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is obſerved ſome of them have beene very diligent, gathering great quantities of Gold.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is informed, that more than an ordinary number of Papiſts are gone beyond Sea already, and thoſe of the better ſort.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The great number of <hi>Engliſh</hi> fugitives now beyond the Seas, who by their late deſignes and practiſes, are knowne to be full of malice to the State, and will no doubt, ſeeke all opportunities of acceſſe to, her Majeſty; and as much as they can labour to infuſe into her ſuch evill Counſels, as may trouble the peace of the Kingdome, whereof at this time there is more danger, becauſe the affaires of the Kingdome are not yet fully ſettled, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on disbanding of the Army, all parts are like to abound with Souldiers, and ſuch others as will be apt to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to tumults and ſeditions; eſpecially in the time of the Kings abſence in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. That the Houſe of Commons have received information of great quantity of Treaſure in Jewells, Plate, and ready Money, packt up to be conveyed away with the Queene, not onely in ſuch a proportion, as the preſent occaſions with due reſpect to her Majeſties Honour, may ſeeme to require, but a farre greater quantity, and that divers Papiſts and others, under pretence of her Majeſties goods, are like to convey great ſummes of money, and other Treaſures beyond the Seas, which will not onely impoveriſh the State, but may be imployed to the fomenting ſome miſchievous attempts, to the trouble, of the publique peace.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. That as it will be a great diſhonour to the State, if her Majeſty ſhould not be attended and furniſhed ſutably to her quality, ſo it will be a very heavie burthen in this time of great neceſſity and occaſions of other pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique charges, if ſhee ſhall be provided in ſo Royall a manner, as ſhall be fit for her Majeſty, and the honour of the King and Kingdome.</p>
               <p n="5">V. That becauſe we underſtand by Sir <hi>Theodore Mayerne,</hi> that the chiefe cauſe of her Majeſties-ſickneſſe, and diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, proceed from ſome diſcontent of her minde; the Houſe of Commons have thought good to declare, that if any thing within the power of Parliament may give her Majeſty contentment, they are ſo tender of her health, both in due reſpect to his moſt Excellent Majeſty, and her ſelfe, that they will be ready to further her ſatisfaction in all things, ſo farre as may ſtand with that publike, to which they are obliged.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. That the Commons conceive it will be ſome diſhonour to this Nation if her M<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. ſhould at this unſeaſonable time go out of the Kingdome, upon any griefe or diſcontent received here, and therefore we ſhall labour by all good meanes to take away, and prevent all juſt occaſions of her Majeſties trouble, in ſuch manner, as may further her content, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in her health, which will be a very great comfort, and joy to our ſelves, and the reſt of his Majeſties loving Subjects.</p>

               <p>VVHen the Parliament did th' other day expreſſe their Affections to me, in taking into conſideration the journey which I had reſolved on for the recovery of my health, and repreſented a deſire of my ſtay, with a tender care of removing all occaſions of my indiſpoſition, I could not then give a poſitive anſwer, ſuch as I deſired for their ſatisfaction, becauſe I knew not that my health would give way unto it; but ſince that time I have reſolved to venture my health, and (for complying with their deſires) not to goe, ſince my preſence here, will be acceptable unto them; and that they conceive it will be for the good of the Kingdome: For I deſire nothing more, than to let you ſee, that I ſhall in all things be ready to gratifie them, and to ſerve the State, though (as I then ſaid) with the hazard of my life.</p>
