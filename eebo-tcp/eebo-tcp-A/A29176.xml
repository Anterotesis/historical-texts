            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of <hi>R. Doleman,</hi> wrote a Book entituled, <hi>A Conference about the

The firſt, pretended to have been the <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> of a <hi>Civil
Lawyer,</hi> concerning <hi>Succeſſion</hi> by Proximity of Blood in general,
<hi>contains,</hi> for the moſt part, in nine Chapters, the very <hi>Principles</hi> of

underſtood by the Author; and are matter of fact only.</p>
            <p>The Second Part is there ſaid to be the <hi>Speech</hi> of a <hi>Temporal Lawyer,</hi>
about the <hi>particular Titles</hi> of all ſuch as might pretend, <hi>within England,</hi>

her immediate Heir; and either to fix it upon the <hi>Earl,</hi> (for whom he
had made a Title,) or to promote a Contention between the King and
him about it, while by ſome means or other (which was their main in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention)
the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> by a far-fetch'd <hi>Title,</hi> might obtain the
<hi>Kingdom,</hi> and thereby advance their own Purpoſes and Religion.</p>

            <p>And how lately there hath come forth a <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> under the name of
<hi>A Brief Hiſtory of the Succeſſion, collected out of the Records, and moſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick

            <p>Much or the <hi>Materials</hi> of this <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> and moſt of the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in, it concerning the <hi>Succeſſion,</hi> are taken out of the <hi>Jeſuit</hi>'s Book,
the <hi>Speeches</hi> and <hi>Abſtract</hi> before mentioned; but this <hi>Author</hi>'s induſtry
leads him further than <hi>Polydor Virgil,</hi> who is moſtly cited by his <hi>three Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors;</hi>
and ſometimes <hi>Stowe</hi> and <hi>Hollinſhead.</hi> And for the making his
Work more <hi>plauſible</hi> and <hi>paſſable,</hi> and more readily to be received by his
ordinary Readers, he takes very little notice of <hi>Polydor</hi> (who <hi>pointed</hi> him

ancient Writers, in his <hi>Saxon Inſtances</hi> eſpecially: whoſe Words, if faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
cited, would have been of no uſe to him; for often, in the middle of the <hi>Sentences,</hi> and of <hi>Records</hi> he hath cited, he hath left out ſuch Words

and Bickerings between the petty Kings and Governors of the

            <p>From the various Expreſſions of the antient Writers of the <hi>Saxon</hi>
Story, concerning the Succeſſion, an unwary Reader would think the
<hi>Saxons</hi> agreed not in one Rule of Succeſſion, or that they had no Rule
at all. But whoever conſiders with underſtanding what here is ſaid,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54279:5"/>
will find they had, and purſued a ſure Rule of Succeſſion; which was
either Right of Blood, or the Nomination and Appointment of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
King (as we hinted before) which Nomination by the <hi>Saxon</hi>
Kings moſtly happened in the Minority or Nonage of their Children,
and that only<note n="b" place="margin">Vit. Aelfred. fol. 9. lin. 4. ſect. 9.</note> was thought and allowed Cauſe ſufficient for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to prefer his Brother's Son before his own, or a Baſtard before his
lawful Iſſue. For by the ſubſequent Inſtances it will plainly appear, that
the <hi>Saxons</hi> did in their Subjection, owning of, and Submiſſion to their
Princes, acknowledge both Proximity of Blood, and Nomination of
their Princes; often both, ſometimes only one of them; but never
followed any other Rule.</p>

               <p>Theſe Hiſtorians lived at the very time theſe things were done. It

probably required to be there) which ought to be preſent at his

that no Man hath Right to ſucceed in the Kingdom, unleſs, after
ſeeking God, he be unanimouſly choſen by the Univerſity of the
Kingdom, (that is, thoſe that are here ſaid to meet at <hi>London.</hi>) And
according to the Eminency of his Endowments, pre-elected, according
the Example and Similitude of <hi>Saul,</hi> the first anointed King, whom God
ſet over his People; not the Son of a King, or of the Royal Line. like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
after him, <hi>David;</hi> the Son of <hi>Jeſſe.</hi> This becauſe ſtout and fit
for Royal Dignity: the other becauſe holy and humble. That ſo he
which exceeded all Men of the Kingdom in Strength or Proweſs,
ſhould be ſet over all in Power and Government. but if an of the
Progeny of the dead King did excell others, they ought more readily
to conſent to the Election of him. Theſe things we have therefore
ſaid in the behalf of the famous Earl <hi>John,</hi> who is here preſent, the
Brother of our moſt illuſtrious dead King <hi>Richard,</hi> that died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Iſſue of his Body; who is Provident, Stout, and manifeſtly
Noble, whom we, having invoked the Grace of the Holy Spirit, have
all of us unanimouſly choſen. Nor dare any others ſo much as doubt of
theſe things, knowing the Arch-Biſhop had not thus decreed this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
without Cauſe.</q> But Earl <hi>John</hi> and all there acquieſced in what he
had ſaid; and chuſing or acknowledging, and receiving him for their
King, ſhouted, ſaying, <hi>Let the King live.</hi> But Arch-Biſhop <hi>Hubert</hi>
being asked afterward, why he ſaid theſe things? anſwered, that
he gueſſed, and was taught and aſcertained by certain Oracles, that
<hi>John</hi> would bring the Kingdom and Crown into great Confuſion: And
therefore, leſt he might have too much Liberty in doing it, he affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
he ought to come in by Election, and not by Hereditary Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
and ſo was Crowned as before rehearſed.</p>
               <p>This Learned Doctrine and Preachment of the Arch-Biſhop aſſerts not
any Right of Election in the Convention of Biſhops, Earls, Barons, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
required to be at the Coronation; but by his own Anſwer, when he
was asked why he ſaid theſe things, it clearly diſcovers a Deſign only and

the <hi>Lancaſtrians</hi> ſaid his ſecond Son <hi>Edmund,</hi> commonly called <hi>Crouch-Back,</hi>
was the eldeſt, and laid aſide for his deformity; on whoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
was originally founded the great Contention between the two <hi>Royal

And very frequently <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi> who lived at this time, and was
Hiſtoriographer to his Father, calls him his Firſt-born. So that there

               <p>But whoever reads this ſtory, will not find the ordinary People had
much, if any thing to do in this matter, further than as they were <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited</hi>
to <hi>Tumults</hi> and <hi>Railing</hi> at the Government, by many of the <hi>Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

Inſtruments of deſigning Men againſt the Government, if by remiſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

was <hi>depoſed</hi> and <hi>murdered</hi> by a wicked <hi>Confederacy</hi> and <hi>Rebellion</hi> of many

of <hi>Laws, Lawyers,</hi> or <hi>Officers</hi> of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> to maintain, plead for, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend

and uſed too great and unſeaſonable Indulgence to ſuch as he permitted

the time and doings of this King, yet if he might boldly ſpeak what he thought,
He was a Prince the moſt unthankfully uſed of his Subjects of any one of
whom ye ſhall lightly read: For, although (through Frailty of Youth) he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaned
himſelf more diſſolutely than ſeemed convenient for his Royal Eſtate,
and made choice of ſuch Counſellors as were not favoured of the People;
whereby he was the leſs favoured himſelf. Yet in no King's days were the
Commons in greater Wealth, if they could have perceived their happy State.
Neither in any other time were the Nobles and Gentlemen more cheriſhed,
nor Church-men leſs wronged. But ſuch was their Ingratitude towards their
bountiful and loving Sovereign, that thoſe whom he had chiefly advanced,
were readieſt to control him, for that they might not rule all things at their
Will, and remove from him ſuch as they miſliked, and place in their rooms
whom they thought good; and that rather by ſtrong Hand, than by gentle
and courteous means: Which ſtirred ſuch malice betwixt him and them,</p>

<hi>Immediately upon the Diſſolution and Deceaſy of</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>late Queen of</hi>
England, <hi>the Imperial Crown of the Realm of</hi> England, <hi>and all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
Dominions and Rights belonging to the ſame, did by inherent Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
and lawful and undoubted Succeſſion, deſcend and come to His moſt

they do moſt humbly and faithfully ſubmit and oblige themſelves,
their Heirs and Poſterities for ever, until the laſt drop of their Bloods
be ſpent.</p>
               <p>What can be clearer than that the <hi>Succeſſion</hi> to the Crown of <hi>England</hi>
was always <hi>thought, judged, had, taken</hi> and <hi>reputed</hi> to be from <hi>Next<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
of Blood, by the Opinion of all ſober Men, by <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> by
this, and other <hi>Acts</hi> of Parliament, and <hi>Statutes</hi> before cited.</p>
               <p>This then being the true Hiſtory and Caſe of Succeſſion to the Crown
of <hi>England,</hi> and its being only founded upon Proximity of Blood, the
Author of the <hi>Brief Hiſtory of Succeſſion, &amp;c.</hi> ought to have called it
<hi>An Hiſtory of Vſurpations, Seditions and Rebellions.</hi> It was written and
intended for a <hi>purpoſe</hi> he will not own; that is, to ſhew, that <hi>In the</hi>
Engliſh <hi>Monarchy there is not Right of Succeſſion;</hi> but that Parliaments
or Armies may ſet up whom they pleaſe.</p>
               <p>This, I confeſs, hath been practiſed in this Nation; and it was the
main Cauſe of the War between the Families of <hi>Tork</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter;</hi>
that proceeding from the <hi>Right</hi> of the one Patty, and <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> of the
other, and the <hi>Contrarieties</hi> of Acts of Parliament was cauſed by the
<hi>Alternate Victories</hi> of both.</p>
               <p>But the doing of a thing makes it not lawful: Repeated Wickedneſs,
or the frequent Repetition of Wiekedneſs, gives no Authority to any
one to commit that Wickedneſs, as the frequency of Adulteries or Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries
doth not juſtifie either of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:54279:20"/>
I think it's no good Argument to ſay, <hi>Edward</hi> the Second was <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed</hi>
and <hi>murthered,</hi> therefore <hi>Richard</hi> the Second might be <hi>depoſed</hi>
and <hi>murthered;</hi> or, That they were both depoſed and murthered,
therefore <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt might be <hi>depoſed</hi> and <hi>murthered;</hi> or, Becauſe
<hi>King Charles</hi> the Firſt was depoſed and murthered, therefore <hi>King
Charles the Second</hi> may be depoſed and murthered.</p>
               <p>Precedents are of force only in things <hi>lawful, obſcure</hi> or <hi>dubious,</hi> but
never, in things <hi>unjuſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Depoſitions and Murthers of <hi>Edward</hi> the Second and <hi>Richard</hi>
the Second, the Uſurpations and unlawful Actions of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth
and <hi>Richard</hi> the Third, were in their own times condemned by all
good Men, even as the <hi>Actions</hi> of that Parliament began in 1641. in
ours, which I ſuppoſe is the reaſon why the Author of the <hi>Pamphlet</hi>
brings not them in as a <hi>Precedent;</hi> which would have ſerved his turn
better than all his other Inſtances.</p>
               <p>But beſides their <hi>impious Inſtances,</hi> we ought to take notice of the
<hi>Expreſſions</hi> of theſe Men of <hi>Jeſuitical Principles.</hi> They call <hi>Uſurpation</hi>
the <hi>Election</hi> of the People; a <hi>Faction,</hi> the <hi>Commonwealth;</hi> the <hi>Actions</hi> of
<hi>a few they impute to all; They call Rebellion a juſt and judicial Proceeding;
often and open Perjury, an orderly Revoking of a Sentence; God's ſecret
Judgment</hi> in permitting Injuſtice to prevail, his <hi>owning</hi> and <hi>allowance</hi>
thereof; the <hi>Inconſiſtency</hi> and preſent <hi>Humour</hi> of the <hi>heedleſs Multitude,</hi>
(who <hi>judge</hi> of things, not by <hi>Reaſon</hi> or <hi>Juſtice,</hi> but either by <hi>Opinion,</hi>
which commonly is partial; or elſe by <hi>Report,</hi> which is uſually full of
<hi>Incertainties</hi> and <hi>Errors,</hi> the moſt part <hi>Doing</hi> becauſe others <hi>Do;</hi> all ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
to be drawn in to ſerve any <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>ambitious</hi> Men's <hi>Attempts</hi>)
they call the preſumed <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Conſent</hi> of the People: According to
which (ſay they) the <hi>Succeſſion</hi> of the Crown is to be directed. And
by theſe <hi>Arts</hi> they do very much <hi>impoſe</hi> upon their unwary Readers.</p>
               <p>To this Hiſtory of Succeſſion belongs the Act of the Thirteenth of
<hi>Elizabeth, cap.</hi> 1. intituled <hi>An Act whereby certain Offences are made
Treaſon;</hi> which, as many great and learned Perſons think, was, upon
the debate and making of it, intended and deſigned to declare a Power

to make Laws and Statutes of ſufficient force and validity, to limit and
bind the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and the Deſcent, Limitation, Inheritance

                  <hi>That the Queen of</hi> Scots <hi>ſhould renounce her Title and Claim as

Right and Title ſhe claimed to</hi> England.</p>
               <p>To which the <hi>Deputies</hi> of the Queen of <hi>Scots Lieutenants</hi> anſwered,
<hi>That the Title ſhould be renounced as long as Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>lived:</hi> And

               <p>There was no Agreement upon theſe, and other Propoſitions then

<note n="o" place="margin">Ibid. f. 118.</note> that <hi>Murray</hi> had reported that the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> had made over her
<hi>Title</hi> to <hi>England</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> and that her Conveyance was

               <p>How <hi>neceſſary</hi> this Match was at this time for the <hi>ſafety</hi> of the

Miniſter; with whom <hi>Leyceſter</hi> and <hi>Burleigh</hi> concurred in Opinion,
as appears by their <hi>ſeveral Letters</hi> relating to theſe <hi>Tranſactions.</hi> And
ſince the <hi>French,</hi> in the Sixth Article delivered in by the <hi>French</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
the Thirteenth of <hi>April,</hi> 1571. propounded the Succeſſion to
be ſecured to the Iſſue of this Marriage, according to the <hi>Laws</hi> and
<hi>Cuſtoms</hi> of the Realms; to which Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> according to the
common Opinion of the Underſtanding Men of thoſe Times, not
having Right by <hi>Inheritance</hi> or <hi>Proximity of Blood,</hi> might think by
this Act of Parliament (that in effect doth grant the general Surmiſe)
to make good her Title, and by this way and means to notifie it to
be according to the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> of the Realm. For the Duke of
<hi>Anjou</hi> could not but have notice of the pretended <hi>Defectiveneſs</hi> of her
Claim, though not mentioned in the Treaty; and therefore this
might haply be done as much as could be to meet with and ſatisfie that
Objection, if it ſhould be made, and that this might be a private,
though none of the great Conſiderations, of procuring and paſſing
this Act. He that will but obſerve theſe Particulars of Hiſtory, and
will take the pains to compare them with this Act, may eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it was made as a Proviſion againſt ſuch <hi>things, pretences,</hi> and <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts,</hi>
for the future, during Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign, as had then been
done, uſed, and practiſed: it being then doubted whether the <hi>Laws</hi>

               <p>This Statute was a <hi>peculiar Law</hi> made for the <hi>Preſervation</hi> of

               <p>And if we conſider how much (if not altogether) her <hi>Title</hi> to the

<hi>own advantage</hi> and <hi>ſafety,</hi> ſhe attributed more to an Act of Parliament
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54279:22"/>
than otherwiſe ſhe would have done. She was neceſſitated to take
this courſe, to eſtabliſh her ſelf againſt the <hi>Pretences</hi> of the Queen of

Title, She being then the <hi>only remaining Iſſue</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth;
yet her right was recognized as <hi>depending</hi> upon the <hi>Lawes</hi> and <hi>Statutes</hi>
of the Realm, and by expreſs mention of and <hi>reference</hi> to the Thirty
fifth of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth; by which <hi>Statute</hi> the Crown was ſettled
upon <hi>her,</hi> and the <hi>Heirs of her Body</hi> lawfully begotten; in ſeveral places
whereof, ſhe is by the King her Father, <hi>implicitly reputed</hi> and <hi>declared

               <p>In the firſt of her Reign before cited,<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> when the <hi>Crown</hi> was <hi>declared</hi> to

and <hi>Declaration</hi> of the <hi>Succeſſion</hi> of the Imperial Crown of this Realm
mentioned and conteined in the Act of 35 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. were to ſtand, remain,
and be <hi>the Law of this Land for ever.</hi> Which notwithſtanding, when
<hi>Mary Queen</hi> of <hi>Scots</hi> had <hi>claimed</hi> the Crown by right of <hi>Inheritance,</hi>
and had ſpread abroad that <hi>Title</hi> unto it, and alſo the <hi>Title</hi> of the <hi>Houſe</hi>
of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and other <hi>Titles</hi> were whiſpered up and down; the Act of
35 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. or this Act of <hi>Recognition,</hi> were not thought <hi>ſufficient</hi> to
<hi>ſecure</hi> the Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> Then was this Act in the Thirteenth
of her Reign made meerly either to <hi>create</hi> or <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> her Title,
and not to <hi>Exclude</hi> the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> from the SUCCESSION,
unleſs ſhe attempted any thing againſt her, or laid <hi>Claim</hi> to the Crown,
which was alſo in its own nature a ſecuring Clauſe to Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth:</hi>
But the great <hi>Clauſe</hi> of <hi>Security</hi> to Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in this
Act, was that <hi>Clauſe</hi> by which it was made <hi>Treaſon</hi> for any man to
<hi>affirm</hi> that ſhe by <hi>Authority</hi> of Parliament <hi>could not make Lawes and
Statutes to bind the Succeſſion</hi> of the Crown, or that this Act or other
<hi>Lawes</hi> to be made by the Parliament of <hi>England by her Royal aſſent,</hi>
for <hi>limiting</hi> the <hi>Crown</hi> and <hi>recognizing</hi> the <hi>right</hi> to be <hi>lawfully</hi> and
<hi>juſtly</hi> in her <hi>perſon, is not, are not, or ſhall not, or ought not to be for
ever, of good and ſufficient force.</hi> This <hi>Clauſe</hi> was <hi>levelled</hi> againſt the
<hi>Opinion,</hi> That the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> had the beſt Title; which began to
ſpread, and gain much credit, as well amongſt the <hi>Nobility</hi> as <hi>Commons:</hi>
By all which it is manifeſt, this <hi>whole Act</hi> was but Temporary; and
therefore we may <hi>note,</hi> with <hi>Pulton,</hi> that it <hi>expired</hi> with Queen
<hi>Elizabeth;</hi> and it was <hi>no</hi> Act of <hi>Excluſion,</hi> but a <hi>Law</hi> only to ſecure
her Perſon, and to <hi>make</hi> and <hi>confirm</hi> unto her a <hi>Title,</hi> which without
<hi>Statute-Law</hi> was <hi>in it ſelf</hi> at leaſt <hi>doubtful.</hi> And the <hi>new Clauſe</hi> which
was added, That it ſhould be <hi>High Treaſon,</hi> during her Life, for any
Perſon to affirm, ſhe by Authority of Parliament had not Power to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54279:23"/>
                  <hi>bind</hi> the <hi>Crown,</hi> and <hi>Succeſſion</hi> thereof; or, That the Right of the
Crown and Realm was not juſtly and lawfully, in her Royal Perſon;
cannot <hi>affect</hi> the <hi>Title</hi> of a lawful <hi>Succeſſor</hi> by <hi>Inheritance,</hi> nor be
brought or made uſe of as a <hi>Precedent</hi> to <hi>exclude</hi> him from, the <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it may be ſaid, There is a great Forfeiture inflicted upon every
Perſon holding and affirming, <hi>after her Deceaſe,</hi> That Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
and a Parliament <hi>could not limit the Succeſſion,</hi> and <hi>fix the Crown upon
her own Head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Clauſe could take no effect after her death, and therefore was
<hi>added</hi> to preſerve her Memory from being defamed after her Death,
or ſlanderouſly charged with the <hi>hainous Crime</hi> of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurping</hi> the Crown,
which in muſt have been the <hi>inevitabble Conſequence</hi> of affirming ſhe and
her Parliament could not limit the Succeſſion.</p>
               <p>For ſhe valued much her Credit and Reputation, and would ſeem
to maintain ſtill, that he acted nothing againſt the Queen of <hi>Scots;</hi>
and therefore the <hi>Law</hi> is made in <hi>general Words,</hi> againſt <hi>every Perſon
or Perſons whatſoever,</hi> of what Degree, Place, Nation, or Condition
whatſoever, that ſhould affirm ſhe was not in Right true and lawful
Queen, or that ſhould claim the Crown, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>Point</hi> of <hi>Succeſſion</hi> ſhe could never be brought expreſly by
