            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE MAN of WISDOM.</head>
            <l>THE Man that's Wise to Know All Things aspires,</l>
            <l>But First the Knowledge of Himself desires:</l>
            <l>How far the Compass of his Strength can go;</l>
            <l>But his own Weakness studdies most to know.</l>
            <l>He Reasons more by Practice than by Rule;</l>
            <l>His Logick's learnt in Observation's School.</l>
            <l>Taught by Experience truly to reflect,</l>
            <l>Can First Himself and then his Friends direct.</l>
            <l>He ne'er suspends but in a doubtful Case;</l>
            <l>Ne'er doubts where Resolution should take place.</l>
            <l>Of ev'ry needful Thing just Care do's take,</l>
            <l>But most concern'd for his immortal stake.</l>
            <l>Without that scope counts fruitless each endeavour,</l>
            <l>Nor would be Happy Once, if not for ever.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:51485:4"/>Himself best Knowing best Himself can Trust,</l>
            <l>Others so far as He has prov'd them Just.</l>
            <l>The World may Him deceive but ne'er Abuse,</l>
            <l>Who Trusts no more than He can bear to lose.</l>
            <l>While close Retirement is to Him a Skreen,</l>
            <l>Himself looks through and sees the World, Unseen:</l>
            <l>Yet shews, when forc'd the Day-light to abide,</l>
            <l>Prudence, not Affectation, made him hide.</l>
            <l>Does never, Causeless, from his purpose Range,</l>
            <l>When Reason calls, He never fears to Change.</l>
            <l>While th' ablest Master He's allow'd to be,</l>
            <l>No Scholar more dispos'd to learn than He.</l>
            <l>From ev'ry Thing Instruction He can draw,</l>
            <l>And from Him each Instruction is a Law.</l>
            <l>To Ages past his nimble Thoughts can Climb,</l>
            <l>In Things to come prevent the speed of Time.</l>
            <l>Unborn Events by past Events forestall,</l>
            <l>And in Conjecture be Prophetical.</l>
            <l>His Passions He ne'er suffers to Rebel,</l>
            <l>Or hastens their first Mutiny to Quell.</l>
            <l>By Honour's Light in all his Projects sails,</l>
            <l>And Boards a second when a former fails.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:51485:4"/>Makes Disappointment but improve his skill,</l>
            <l>And fetches Strength from what succeeded ill.</l>
            <l>Some Wrongs He sees not but with silent Art,</l>
            <l>Dissembles Wounds too pow'rful Foes impart.</l>
            <l>Loves to owe less in good turns than He may,</l>
            <l>For Bad wou'd be in Debt and never pay.</l>
            <l>Censures, Unjust or Just, alike to Him;</l>
            <l>Those He Deserves not, These he can Contemn.</l>
            <l>Slights Scandal, lays no violent Hands on Blame,</l>
            <l>Gives Slander scope till it expire with Shame.</l>
            <l>His Joy no Fears, his Hope knows no Despairs,</l>
            <l>Safe in the Circle of his own Affairs.</l>
            <l>From others strife he timely do's Retire,</l>
            <l>Nor thrusts his Hand into a needless Fire.</l>
            <l>He best the Purchase of his Wit can tell,</l>
            <l>And how to Value, Keep and Use it well.</l>
            <l>Himself his own best Lawyer, and his skill,</l>
            <l>His readiest and most faithful Oracle.</l>
            <l>Consulted, He's in no Man's Business Blind,</l>

            <head>THE VALIANT MAN.</head>
            <l>BOld without Rashness, without Fury, Warm:</l>
            <l>He long Consults, but do's with speed perform.</l>
            <l>He seeks not Dangers: when on Him they press,</l>
            <l>He bears 'em down with Courage and Success.</l>
            <l>Arm'd Death Enthron'd on Slaughter He can spy,</l>
            <l>March on, and with a scornful smile pass by.</l>
            <l>Forecasts the worst Events, and in his Thought,</l>
            <l>Before one stroke Exchang'd, the Battle's fought.</l>
            <l>If unexpected Ills his Heart surprize,</l>
            <l>One Minute to disperse 'em will suffice:</l>
            <l>With instant Sally he prevents the Blow,</l>
            <l>And turns Amazement back upon the Foe.</l>
            <l>Ne'er seen to fly, but from some foul Offence,</l>
            <l>And fears no Strength below Omnipotence.</l>
            <l>Peace he wou'd chuse, and when the Sword he draws,</l>
            <l>He looks not on his Hand but on his Cause.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:51485:5"/>Nor weighs what Succors wait to take his Part,</l>
            <l>How strong his Arm, but Innocent his Heart.</l>
            <l>O'erpower'd may fall, with numbers Vanquisht be,</l>
            <l>And leave the Foe to Blush at Victory.</l>
            <l>Call'd out by Honour to some bold Attacque,</l>
            <l>His Hearts Blood may be seen, but ne'er his Back.</l>
            <l>On base Conditions he disdains to Live,</l>
            <l>And what he asks, would to the Vanquish'd give.</l>
            <l>Ne'er known the Blood of Innocents to shed,</l>
            <l>On Carcases, or suppliant Foes to tread;</l>
            <l>He'll rather stifle Wrongs he might Resent,</l>

            <l>Nor can determine which he'd rather be,</l>

            <l>His sparing Words no room for Boast affords,</l>
            <l>His readiest Language is, his Hand and Sword.</l>
            <l>By Action heard, whose never-ceasing Force,</l>
            <l>Keeps every Talker furnish'd with Discourse.</l>
            <l>Not idlely Prodigal of Life or Blood,</l>
            <l>But sparing neither for his Countrey's good.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:51485:6"/>While Fate does noble Means of Life supply,</l>
            <l>He Lives; but those refus'd, can bravely Dye.</l>
            <l>His Pow'r (to which his Reason still gives Laws,)</l>
            <l>It's Right Confest, the Exercise withdraws.</l>
            <l>Thinks he does then the greatest Triumph gain,</l>
