         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Ambassadour of <hi>Muley Hamet, Sheck. K.</hi>
of <hi>Morocco,</hi> when he was in <hi>England</hi> about
four or five yeares since; said on a time,
sitting at dinner at his house at <hi>Woodstreet,</hi>
he thought verily that <hi>Algiers</hi> was foure
times as rich as <hi>London:</hi> An English Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
replied that he thought not so; but
that <hi>London</hi> was farre richer then that, and for plenty <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
might compare with <hi>Hierusalem</hi> in the peacefull dayes
of <hi>Solomon.</hi> For my part, I beleeved neither, especially the
Merchant, for in the time of <hi>Solomon,</hi> silver was as plentifull in
<hi>Hierusalem</hi> as stones in the street; but with us stones are in
farre more abundance, when in every street in <hi>London,</hi> you
may walk over five thousand load ere you finde a single pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie.
Againe, the generall complaint and murmure thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Kingdome of the scarcity and want of money, argues
that we fall farre short of that plenty which the Merchant
imagined.</p>
            <p>And one time I began to bethink my selfe, and to look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the causes of our want, and this generall scarcity, and I
found them manifold. First, some men who by their wits
or industrie (or both) have serued and wound themselves
into vast estates, and gathered thousands like the Griffons of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101912:4"/>
               <hi>Bactria</hi> when they have met with a gold myne) so brood
over, and watch it day and night, that it is impossible for
Charity to be regarded, Vertue rewarded, or Necessitie relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
and this we know to have been the ruine, not onely of
such private persons themselves, but of whole estates and
kingdomes. That I may instance one for many, <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
was taken by the Turke when the Citizens abounding in
wealth and money, would not part with a peny in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
necessity, no, not for the repaire of their battered wals,
or the levying of souldiers to defend them.</p>
            <p>Another sort doat upon the stampe of their money, and
the bright lustre of their gold, and rather then they will suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it to see the light, will hide it in hills, old walls, thatch or
tiles of their houses, tree-roots, and such places, as not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
yeares since at <hi>Wainslet</hi> in Lincolnshire, there was found
in digging of a backside to sow hempe in, an old rustie hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met
of iron, rammed in full of peeces of gold, with the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
and arms of King <hi>Henry</hi> the first; and money thus hid,
the owners seldome or never meet withall again, being
many times prevented by sudden death, lost by casualty, or
their forgetfulnesse.</p>
            <p>Mounsieur <hi>Gaulart,</hi> a great man of <hi>France</hi> (though none
of the wisest) in the times of the civill warres buried some
two thousand crownes, a mile or two from his house, in an
open fallow field; and that he might know the place again,
took his mark from the spire of a steeple, that was right a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the place: the wars being ended, he came with a
friend of his, as neere the place as he could gesse, to look for
his money, which he not finding, and wondering what the
reason should be, after (in the circumference) he had gone
about the steeple, (being right against it which way soever
he went) quoth he to his friend, is there no cheating knave
(think you) in the steeple that turnes it about, intending to
cheat me of my money, imagining that it went round, and
himselfe stood still, as <hi>Copernicus</hi> did of the Globe of the
Earth.</p>
            <p>Indeed much money and treasure, in former times, as of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101912:4"/>
the invasion of the <hi>Saxons, Danes, Normans</hi> here with us, and
of others in other places, hath been this way bestowed, and
for this reason in such troublesome times become scarce for
whole ages after: but this is no cause of want of money in
our times, wherein (it is true) we have little money to hide,
yet there are not wanting among us, those <hi>Monedulae,</hi> or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
hiding Dawes, who repine and envie, that either King
or Countrey, should be one peny better (yea even in the
greatest extremity) for what they have conveyed into their
holes. And most true it is, that money so heaped up in
chests, and odde corners, is like (as one saith) unto dung,
which while it lies upon an heape doth no good, but disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and cast abroad, maketh fields fruitfull. Hence <hi>Aristotle</hi>
concludeth, that the prodigall man is more beneficiall to,
and deserveth better of his countrey then the covetous mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser,
every trade and vocation fareth the better for him, as
the Tailor, Haberdasher, Vintner, Shoemakers, Sempsters,
Hostlers, and the like.</p>
            <p>The covetous person is acquainted with none of these,
for in stead of Satten, he suits himselfe with Sacken, he
trembles as he passes by a Taverne doore, to heare a recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of eight shillings sent up into the halfe Moone, for
Wine, Oisters, and Faggots, for his owne naturall drink
(you must know) is between that the Frogs drink,<note place="margin">Scar beere brewed with broom in the Low Countreys at peny farthing the gallon is much like it.</note> and a
kinde of pitifull small Beere, too bad to be drunk, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
too good to drive a Water-mill: the Haberdasher gets
as little by him as he did by an old acquaintance of mine by
<hi>Li<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ne</hi> in <hi>Norfolke,</hi> who when he had worne an hat eight and
thirty yeares, would have petitioned the Parliament against
Haberdashers, for abusing the Countrey in making their
ware so slight. For the Shomaker, he hath as little to do with
him as ever <hi>Tom Coryat</hi> had: for Sempsters (it is true) that
he loves their faces better then their fashions: for Playes, if
he read but their titles upon a post, he hath enough. Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
he knowes none, save some of three pence in Black-Horse-Alley,
and such places. For Tapsters and Hostlers, they
hate him as hell, as not seeing a mote in his cup once in seven
yeares.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:101912:5"/>Another cause of scarcity and want of money, are peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
times, the nurses of pride and idlenesse, wherein people
increase, yet hardly get imployment, those of the richer and
abler sort give themselves to observe and follow every fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion,
as what an infinite summe of money yearly goeth
out of this kingdome into forraine parts for the fuell of our
fashionable pride? Let me hereto adde the multitude of
strangers that daily come over into our warmer soile, (as the
Cranes in winter betake themselves to <hi>Aegypt</hi>) where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
enriched themselves through our folly and pride re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,
and purchase great estates in their owne Countreys,
enhaunsing there our moneys to a higher rate, to their exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
gaine, and impoverishing of our people of <hi>England.</hi> Let
me adde hereto beside the great summes of money, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other great and rich gifts, which have beene formerly
conferred upon strangers, which how they have deserved, I
know not; some I am sure like snakes taken up and having
gotten warmth from the Royall fire (have been ready to hisse
at, and sting (as much as in them lieth) both their finders and
their founders.</p>
            <p>Again, there is an indisposition of many men to part with
money in these tickle times, being desirous, if the worst
should happen, to have their friends about them, as Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Moore</hi> said, filling his pockets with gold when he was
carried to the Tower.</p>
            <p>There is likewise, almost a sensible decay of trade and
traffique, which being not so frequent as heretofore, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
(as some would have it) the seas are now more pestered
with Pirats then in times past, the <hi>Receipt of Custome,</hi> like the
stomack wanting the accustomed nourishment, is constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to suck it from the neighbour veines, to the ill disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and weakening of the whole body.</p>
            <p>They are no few, or small summes, which in peeces of
eight are carried over to the East Indies, no doubt to the
great profit and inriching of some in particular, but whether
of the whole kingdome in generall or not, I know not.
What hurt our late questioned Patentees (in Latine <hi>Hirudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>)
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101912:5"/>
have done to the Common Body in sucking and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth even the very life-blood from it, we know
daily, and more we shall know shortly; I wish some of the
craftiest, and most dangerous amongst them, might be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
out for examples, remembring that of <hi>Tacitus, Poena ad
paucos, timor ad multos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All people complaine generally (as I have said) of the
want of mony, which like an Epidemicall disease, hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run
the whole land, the City hath little trading, Countrey-Farmers
complaine of their Rents yearly raised, especially
by their Catholique Landlords) which in times past have bin
accounted the best, though now the case is altred, (and easily
may the reason be ghessed) yet can finde no utterance for
their Commodities, or must sell them at under rates. Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
without money get neither Patrones nor preferment,
Mechanique Artists no work, and the like of other profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
            <p>One very well compared worldly wealth, or money, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a foot all, some few nimble heeled and headed run quite
away with it, when the most are onely looke is on, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
get a kick at it in all their lives.</p>
            <p>Go but among the Usurers in their walk in Moore-fields,
and see if you can borrow an hundred pounds of any of them
without a treble security, with the use one way or other
doubled, and as your selfe, so must your estate be particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
knowne. A pleasant fellow came not long since to one
of them, and desired that he would lend him fifty pounds:
quoth the Usurer, my friend. I know you not, for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
onely I would borrow the money of you, for if you knew
me, I am sure you would not lend me a peny.</p>
            <p>Another meets a Creditour of his in Fleetstreet, who
seeing his old Debter, Oh Master A. quoth he, you are
met in good time, you know there is money between
us, and hath been a long time, and now it is become a
scarce commodity; it is true Sir, quoth the other, but (he
looking down upon the stones that were between) in good
faith I see none: and this was all the Citizen could get at

getting it elsewhere, and when all is done to be paid after

            <p>There was of late years in <hi>France,</hi> a marvellous faire and

a finall dispatch of all her businesse, onely she wanted the
Kings hand, (who was <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of famous memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie)
he, as he was a noble, witty, and understanding Prince,
understanding how well she had sped, (her suit being in the
opinion of most men desperate or lost) told her, that for his

<hi>A friend in Court is better then a peny in the purse:</hi> But
as friends go now adayes, I had rather seek for them in my
parse, then in the Court, and I beleeve many Courtiers are
of my minde. Againe, to teach every one to make much of,
and to keep money when he hath it; let him seriously think
with himselfe, what a miserie it is, and how hard a matter
to borrow it, and most true it is that one faith,
<q>Semper comitem aeris alieniesse miseriam.</q>
               <hi>That miserie is ever the companion of borrowed money.</hi> Hereby
a man is made cheape, and undervalued, despised; deferred,
mistrusted, and oftentimes slatly denied. Beside, upon the
least occasion upbraided therewith in company, and among
friends, and sometime necessitie drives men to be beholden

the old saying is verified: <hi>Mis<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

and ever in humour are monied men; they go where they
list, they weare what they list, they eat and drink what they
list, and as their mindes, so their bodies are free; they feare
no City Serjeant, Court-Marshalls-man, or Countrey-Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffe;
nor are they followed or dog'd home to their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,

are bidden welcome; and if a stoole be fetch'd into the shop,
it is an extraordinary favour, because all passers by take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice

Of this condition are the greatest number in every king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;

were three souldiers, a Dutchman, a Scot, and an English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
for their misdemeanors condemned to be hanged:
yet their lives were begd by three severall men, one a Brick-layer,
that he might help him to make bricks &amp; carry them to

to fetch water and do other worke in the Brewhouse; now
the third was a Gardiner, and desired the third man to help
him to worke in, and to dresse an Hop-garden: the first two
accepted their offers thankfully, this last the Englishman told
his maister in plaine termes his friends never brought him up
to gather Hops, but desired he might be hang'd first, and so
he was.</p>
               <p>Other having had great and faire estates left unto them

travaile beyond Seas, or at home go from towne to towne,
taverne to taverne, to looke for companie; and in a word,
to spend any thing, to live any where save at home, and in
their owne houses.</p>
               <p>Others there are againe who match themselves, for a

Natures of all, which, were their necessities supplied, they
would rather die then do as they sometimes do, borrow and
not be able to pay, to speake untruths, to deceive, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
to cheate their own fathers and friends. What greater
griefe can there be to an ingenuous &amp; free spirit, who sitting
at a superiors table and thought to be necessitous and onely
to come for a dinner, to be plac'd the lowest, to be carve dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
of the worst and first cut, as of boild beefe, brawn, or the

him the milke from her trencher, then assuredly it is burn'd to
the bodie, if he be carved unto out of a pastie of venison,
it was some part that was bruised in the carriage and began
to stinke, yet for all this he must be obsequious, endure any
jeere, whisper for his drinke, and rise at the comming in of
the Bason and Ewer. To do the which, any generous and
truely Noble spirit had rather (as I am perswaded) dine with
my Lord Maiors hounds in Finsburie fields.</p>
               <p>Another miserie, a kinne to the former, is what discourse
soever is offered at such tables, the necessitous man, though
he can speake more to the purpose then them all, yet he
must give them leave to engrosse all the talke, and though he
knowes they tell palpable and grosse lies, speake the absurdest
non-sence that may bee, yet must he be silent, and be held all

not, except we would want meat, drink and our apparell

be used, for most true it is, that of all nations in <hi>Europe,</hi> our

by experience in some tavernes sometime of at least twice
and sometime thrice as much as the meat and dressing hath
been worth: no question but a faire and an honest gaine is to
be allowed, in regard of house rent, linnen, attendance of
servants, and the like; there are without doubt very many ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernes
verie honest and reasonable, and the use of them is
necessary, for if a man meetes with his friend or acquaintance
in the street, whither should they go, having no friends house
neere to go into, especially in rainie or fowle weather, but to
a taverne? where for the expence of a pinte or a quart of

wine they may have a drie house &amp; room to confer or write
to any friends about busines, but to have in a bill 8. s. brought
up for an ordinarie Capon (as my Lord of Northamptons

9. s. for a paire of soales, four shillings for a dozen of Larkes,
would make a Horentine runne out of his wits: how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently

<hi>Pyrrhus</hi> himself) when the Ambassadors of the <hi>Samnites</hi>
brought him an huge summe of gold, they found him sitting
by the fire, and seething of Turneps for his dinner with an
earthen dish in his lap, at what time he gave them this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,
I had rather eat in this dish and command over them,
that have gold, then be rich my selfe, a while after being accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for deceiving the state of money, which he had gotten in
his conquests and kept to himself: he tooke a solemne oath,
that he saved no more of all he gat but that one tree'n, or
wooden barrell, which he had there by him. Marvellous was
the temperance of the Romanes in their diet, as also of the
Turkes at this day, the Italians and Spaniards, but it is in them
naturall, not habituall, and by consequent no vertue as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
would have it, for the inhabitants of hot countries, have
not their digestion so strong as those under cold climates,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101912:15"/>
whose bodies by an <hi>Antiperistasis</hi> or surrounding of the cold
have the natural heate repelled &amp; kept within them, which
is the reason that the Northerne nations are of all other the
greatest eaters and drinkers; and of those, the French say we
of England have the best stomacks and are the greatest
trenchermen of the world, <hi>Les Anglois sont les plus gros
mangeurs, de tout la monde:</hi> but they re deceived; those of
Denmarke and Norway exceed us, and the Russians them. I
confesse we have had, and have yet some remarkable eaters
among us, who for a wager would have eaten with the best
of them, as <hi>Wolmer</hi> of Windsor, and not long since <hi>Wood</hi> of
Kent, who eat up at one dinner nineteen greene geese equall
to the old ones in bignesse with sawce of gooseberries, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as I heard it affirmed to my Lord <hi>Richard</hi> Earle of
<hi>Dorset</hi> at a dinner time at his house at <hi>Knowle</hi> in Kent, by one
of his gentlemen who was an eye witnesse to the same.</p>
               <p>But the truth is, that those men live the longest and are
commonly in perfect health, who content themselves with
least and the simplest meat, which not onely saves the purse,
but preserves the body, as we may see in Lancashire, Shrop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,
Cheshire, Yorkshire, and other countries which are
remote from the citie; and it is Master <hi>Cambdens</hi> observation
in his <hi>Britannia, Vt diutius vivant qui vescuntur Lacticiniis:</hi>
they commonlie are long liv'd, who live by whitmeates,
as milke, butter, cheese curds, and the like. For,<note place="margin">That many dishes breed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diseases.</note> 
                  <hi>Multa fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula
multos morbos gignere,</hi> was truely said of Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi>
as being apt by their sundrie and opposite qualities to breed
much corruption. How healthfull are schollers in our Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities,
whose commons are no more then needs must! Neither
would I have any man starve himself to save his purse, as an
Usurer confessed upon his death-bed, how he was above two
hundred pounds endebted to his bellie, for breakefastes
dinners and suppers which he had defrauded it of in terme
times at London, and in other places, employing his money
to other miserable purposes.</p>
               <p>Money may be well saved, in travaile or in town; if three
or foure shall ioyne their purses, and provide their diet at
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101912:16"/>
the best hand, it is no shame so to do. I have known also some,
who have been verie skilfull in dressing their own diet.
<hi>Homer</hi> tells us that <hi>Achilles</hi> could play the Cooke excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
well, and I beleeve it were not amisse for our English
Travailers so to do in Forraign countries, for many reasons
I have knowne.</p>
               <p>And execrable is the miserable and base humour of many,
who to save their money will live upon vile and loathsome
things, as Mushromes, Snailes, Frogs, mice, young Kitlings,
and the like. In times of extreme dearth or famine, people
(I confesse) have been driven to look out for whatsoever
could nourish, and (as we say) keep life and soule together;
yea, and of farre worse things then these, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of the Jewes, in that horrible and fearfull famine in Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,
at the time of the siege by <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Vespasian:</hi>
such we blame not, most blame worthy are they, who as it
were surfetting of, or loathing that abundant plenty of all
good and wholesome meats God hath afforded us in this
land, and which God by name hath commended to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
make these stuffe their greatest dainties; as I have known
Ladies, who when they have eaten till they could eat no
more of all the daintiest dishes at the table, yet they must eat
the legs of their Larkes, roasted a new in a greasie tallow
candle, and if they carved but a piece of a burnt claw to any
Gentleman at the Table, he must take it as an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
favour from her Ladiship. It were much to be wished,
that they were bound to hold them to their Diet in a deare
yeare, or a wet spring, when Frogs and Snailes may be had
in greatest abundance.</p>

               <p>YOu must, if you would keep money in your purse to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
your credit, at all times be frugall, and thrifty also in
your apparell, not dogging the fashion, or setting your tailor
on work at the sight of every Mounsieurs new suit; there is
a middle, plain and decent garbe, which is best, and most to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101912:16"/>
be commended: this is commonly affected of the most staied
&amp; wisest: What mony might be saved, if we were so wise as
the Dutch or Spaniard, who for these two or three hundred
yeares, have kept themselves to one fashion? But we, the
Apes of <hi>Europe,</hi> like <hi>Proteus,</hi> must change our shapes every
yeare, nay quarter, moneth and week, as well in our dublets,
hose, cloaks, hats, bands, boots, and what not: that Embleme
was not unproper which once I saw in <hi>Antwerpe,</hi> which
was an Hee and a Shee foole turning a double rimmed
wheele upon one axeltree, one on the one side, and the other
on the other; upon the Hee-fooles wheele, were the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
fashions of mens apparell, on the others wheele of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens;
which, as with the revolution of time, went round,
and came into the same place, use, and request again; as for
the present, aloft, and followed of all, by and by cast down,
and despised. I see no reason why a French man should not
imitate our English fashion, as well as we his: What, have
the French more wit then we in fitting clothes to the body,
or a better invention or way insaving money in the buying
or making of apparell? Surely I think not: it may be our
English when they had to do in <hi>France,</hi> got a humour of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
their fashions, which they could not shake off since:
there is no man ever the warmer, or ever the wiser for
a fashion, (so farre forth as it is a fashion) but rather the
contrary; a foole: for needlesse expence, and suffering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to quake for cold, when his clothes in the fashion must
be cut to the skin, his hat hardly cover his crown, but stands
upon his perewig like an Extinguisher: and we know, by
ridiculous experience, every day in the street, that our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and their waiting women, will starve and shiver in the
hardest frost, rather then they will suffer their bare necks
and breasts to passe your eyes unviewed. But some will say
(as I have heard many) there is no man now adayes estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
that follows not the fashion; be it so, the fashions of
these times are very fit to be observed, which is, to be deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
indebted to Mercers, Haberdashers, Sempsters, Tailors,
and other trades, for the fulfilling of a fashionable humour,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101912:17"/>
which a thrifty and wise man avoideth, accommodating
himselfe with apparell faire and seemly, for halfe, or a third

Tailors arise to so great estates as some of them have, and to
build so brave houses, but the fashion? Silkmen and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers

many times they are chosen high Sheriffes, but the fashion?
And I would fain know of any of our prime Fashion-mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,

That from a childe he was ever most careles and

the like; and to parallell him, our late Master <hi>Butter</hi> of
Cambridge, that learned and excellent Physitian. There
is much money to be saved in apparrell, in choise of the
stuffe, for lasting, and cheapnesse: and that you may not be
deceived in the stuffe or price, take the advice of some
honest Tailor, your friend, as no question but every where
there are many. I will instance one; In Cambridge there
dwelt, some twenty or thirty years ago, one <hi>Godfrey Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
who was by his trade a Tailor, but a merry compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with his taber and pipe, and for singing all manner
of Northern songs before Noble and Gentlemen, who
much delighted in his company. Beside, he was Lord of
Sturbridge-Faire, and all the misorders there. On a time,
an old Doctor of the University brought unto him five
yards of pure fine scarlet, to make him a Doctor of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinities
Gown: and withall, desired him to save him the
least shred, to mend an hole, if a moth should eat it: <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey</hi>
having measured, and found that there was enough,
laid it by: Nay, quoth the Doctor, let me see it cut out
ere I go, for though you can play the knave abroad, I
think you are honest at home, and at your work. God
forbid else, quoth <hi>Godfrey,</hi> and that you shall finde by me;
for give me but twenty shillings from you, and I will save
you forty in the making of your gown: that I will, said
the Doctor (who was miserable enough) with all mine
heart; with that he gave him two old <hi>Harrie</hi> Angels out
of his velvet pouch, which <hi>Godfrey</hi> having put into his
pocket, the Doctor desired to tell him how he would save
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:101912:18"/>
him forty shillings: marry will I (quoth <hi>Godfrey</hi>) in
good faith Sir, let some other Tailor in any case make it;
for if I take it in hand, I shall utterly spoile it, for I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
in all my life, made any of this fashion. I report this
for the credit of honest Tailors, who will ever tell their

               <p>OF Recreations, some are more expensive then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
as requiring more addresse and charge: as
Tiltings, Masques, Playes, and the like, which are proper
to Princes Courts: but I speak of those which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to private men, for such is our nature, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
stand long bent, but we must have our relaxations, as
well of minde as body; for of Recreations, some are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to the minde and speculation; as reading of delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and pleasant books, the knowledge of the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
and other contemplative Sciences, which are the
more pleasing and excellent, by how much the pleasure
of the minde excelleth that of the body; others belong
to the body, as walking, riding upon pleasure, shooting,
hunting, hawking, bowling, ringing, <hi>Paille Maille,</hi> and
the like, which are Recreations without doores; others
are within doores, as chesse, tables, cards, dice, billiards,

                     </gap>oco</hi> and the like: but the truth is, the most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of all is, riding with a good horse, and a good compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in the spring, or summer season, into the Countrey,
when blossomes are on the trees, flowers in the fields,
corn and fruit are ripe; in autumne, what sweet and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prospects shall you have on both sides of you upon the
way, delicate green fields, low meadowes, divorces of
Christall streams, woody-hills, parks with deere, hedge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,
orchards, fruit-trees, churches, villages, the houses
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:101912:18"/>
of Gentlemen, and husbandmen, severall habits and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
variety of countrey labour and exercises, and if you
happen (as often it falleth out) to converse with countrey
men of the place, you shall finde them for the most part
understanding enough to give you satisfaction, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
countrey maids, and market wenches, will give as
unhappy answers, as they be asked knavish and uncivill
questions; others there be, who, out of their rusticall sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity,
will afford you matter of mirth if you stay to talk
with them. I remember, riding once by Horn-Castle,
neere to Stikeswold, in <hi>Lincolneshire,</hi> in the heat of sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
I met with a Swineherd keeping his hogs upon a
fallow field. My friend (quoth I) you keep here a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of unruly cattell, I poore soules, they are indeed (quoth
he) I beleeve, said I, they have a language among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
&amp; can understand one another, I as well as you and
I: Were they ever taught? Alas, poor things, they know
not a letter of the book, I teach them all they have: Why,
what sayes that great hog with red spots (quoth I) that
lies under another, in his grunting language: Marry, he
bids him that sleeps so heavie upon him to lie further off.
But to our purpose; The most ordinary recreations of the
Countrey are football, ska<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es, or nine pins, shooting at
butts, quaits, bowling, running at the base, stooleball,
leaping, and the like; whereof some are too violent and
dangerous: the safest recreations are within doores (but
not in regard of cost &amp; expence) for thousands sometimes
are lost at Ordinaries, and Dicing-houses; yea, I have
known goodly Lordships to have been lost at a cast, and
for the sport of one night, some have made themselves
beggers all their lives after.</p>
               <p>Recreation, is so called, <hi>à Recreando,</hi> that is from (by
a Metaphore) of creating a man anew; by putting life,
spirit and delight into him, after the powers of his minde
and body have been decayed, and weakened, with over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:101912:19"/>
much contemplation, studie and labour, and therefore to
be used onely to that end: some go for recreations which
trouble and amuse the minde as much, or more then the
hardest study,<note place="margin">In Basilicon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>doron.</note> as Chesse, which King <hi>Iames</hi> therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth,
<hi>Ouer-Philosophicall a follie:</hi> and indeed, such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations
are to be used, that leave no sting of repentance
for sinne committed by them, or griefe and sorrow for
losse of money and time many dayes after: I could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
many of that nature, but I will onely give some
generall rules to be observed in some of them.</p>
               <p>If you have a minde to recreate your selfe by play, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
adventure but a third part of that money you have:
let those you play withall be of acquaintance, and not
strangers, if you may avoid it.</p>
               <p>Never mis-time your selfe by sitting long at play, as
some will do three or foure dayes and nights together,
and so make your selfe unfit for any businesse in many
dayes after.</p>
               <p>Never play untill you be constrained to borrow or
pawne any thing of your owne, which becommeth a base
groom better then a Gentleman.</p>
               <p>Avoid quarrelling, blasphemous swearing, and in a
word, never play for more then you are willing to lose;
that you may finde your selfe, after your pastime, not the
worse, but the better, which is the end of all Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>There are some, I know, so base and penurious, who
for feare of losing a peny, will never play at any thing;
yet rather then they should want their recreations, I
would wish them to venture at Span-counter, and Dust-point
with Schole-boyes upon their ordinary play-dayes in
a Market-place or Church-porch.</p>

               <head>Of such honest wayes that a man in want may take
to live and get money.</head>
               <p>IF a man hath fallen into poverty or distresse, either by
death of friends, some accident or other by sea or land,
sicknesse, or the like; let him not despaire, for, <hi>Paupertas

an humane body, consisting of many members, so use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
each to either, as one cannot subsist without the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
as a Prince his Counsell and Statesmen are as the

Hands and Feet, are Country and Mechanique
Trades, &amp;c. So God hath ordained, that all men should
have need one of another, that none might live idlely, or
want imployment; wherefore Idlenesse, as the bane of a
Common-wealth, hath a curse attending upon it, it should
be clothed with rags, it should beg its bread, &amp;c. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
I have read in an Italian Historie, of one so idle,
that he was fain to have one to help him stirre his chaps
when he should eat his meat. Now if you would ask me
what course he should take, or what he should do that
wanteth money, let him first bethink himselfe, to what
profession or trade of life he hath been formerly brought
up, if to none, to what his Genius, or naturall disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
standes most affected unto: if he hath a minde to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile,
he shall finde entertainment in the Netherlands,
who are the best pay-masters except the Emperour of
Russia, and the Venetians (I meane for the most meanes)
in Europe. If you list not to follow the warres, you may
finde entertainement among our new Plantations in
<hi>America,</hi> as New England, Virginia, the Barbadas, Saint
Christophers, and the rest, where with a great deale of
delight you may have variety of honest employment, as
fishing with the net or hooke, planting, gardening, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:101912:20"/>
the like, which beside your maintenance you shall finde
it a great content to your conscience to be in action,
which God commaunds us all to be, if you have beene
ever in a Grammer-Schoole you may everie where finde
children to teach, so many, no doubt, as will keepe you
from starving, and it may be in a gentlemans house, or if
you get entertainment of any who followeth the Law,
or practifeth Physick, you may with diligence and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
prove a Clerk to himselfe or some Justice of the
Peace, by the other you may get the knowledge and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of herbes and all forraigne Drugges from his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecarie,
and perhaps manie good receipts for agues
wounds and the like: I have known many this way to
have prooved in a country towne tollerable Physitians,
and have growne rich, if being borne a gentleman
(as our gentlemen doe) you scorne to doe any of these,
you may get to be a gentleman usher to some Ladie or
other, they are not a few that have thrived passing well
this way, and in a word, rather then in miserable and piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
want, let a man undertake any vocation and labour,
alwayes remembring that homely (but true) distich of
old <hi>Tussers.</hi>
               </p>

               </q>
               <p>And as a necessary rule hereto coincident, let every man
endeavour by a dutifull diligence to get a friend, and when
he hath found him (neither are they so easily found in
these dayes) with all care to keep him, and to use him as
one would do a christall or a venice glasse, to take him up
softly and use him tenderly, or as you would a sword of
excellent temper and mettall, not to hack every gate,
or cut every staple and post therewith, but to keepe him
to defend you in your extremest danger. False and seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

friends are infinite, and such be our ordinarie acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
with the complement of glad to see you well,
how have you done this long time, &amp;c. and with these we
meete every day. In a word, for a conclusion, let every

of a penny, and since we are born, we must live, Vivions
