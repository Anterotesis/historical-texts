         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Let no man now thinke admonition vnnecessarie (not

This Scripture doth branch it selfe into two parts.
1. An advice or exhortation. <hi>Take heed &amp;c.</hi> 2. A motiue,
or inducement inforcing the same. <hi>For in so doing, &amp;c.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> In the exhortation, each word riseth into a head. One

feeding others, inferred by a necessary particle of conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion,

            <p>

duty, he must neither tyre, nor retyre, but manly march on,
and stoutly hold out to the last gaspe. <hi>Permane in istis,</hi>
continue therein. Thus <hi>Timothie</hi> is stirred vp and set on
his way as <hi>Elias</hi> was foure times by the spirit.<note place="margin">1 Kings 14.</note> First to a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
warynesse, and wary diligence, lest while the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman

the wheate. 2. To an eminent and more then ordinarie
sanctitie of life, for <hi>sedes prima,</hi> and <hi>vitaima,</hi> the best place,
and basest life sort not well together. 3. To the care of a
pastorall cure, whereof <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Quis idoneus ad haec?</hi>
who is fit for these things? 4. To perseuerance in the
good begun, for he beginnes ill, that goes not on; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hauing put thy hand to the plough,<note place="margin">Gen. 19. 26.</note> looke not backe,

            <p>The first thing is the care which <hi>Timothie</hi> must take,<note place="margin">

the watch, he is to set. The word imports in the originall
a bent of mind, an intention of will, ioyn'd with a care and
contention of the whole man, that his workes warre not
with his wordes, and his deedes disgrace not his doctrine,
whence this collection may be made, <hi>That vigilancie or

the commendation of a threefold commoditie. 1. It is a

an antidote against troubles and crosse occurrences, lest
they vnsettle vs. 3. It instils strength and pith into all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
duties, and parts of Gods worship; without which,
they be either wholly omitted, or but hoverly done, by
which they are quickned, cheered, and well ouerseene.

Those that giue precepts of militarie discipline, require
three things in a worthy leader, skil, vertue, and authority.
1. He must be skilfull not from report, or reading onely, as
some tongue-tall captaines are, but such a one as knowes
well himselfe to order his army, to protract and lengthen
the warre, or drawe on the enemie. 2. He must haue ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,

               <p>One profit we reape by a faithfull discharge of our place,

not this perfection be comparatiuely taken, that a fuller &amp;

examines both faith and life of Priest and people by the

there is no light in them. The Apostles preached no other
things then those which the Prophets and <hi>Moses</hi> said
should come. The doctrine which <hi>Timothy</hi> is here charged
to looke vnto, and touching which hee was to charge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that they taught no other, was not contrary but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant
to those Scriptures, wherein <hi>Timothy</hi> was trained
from his youth; and those Scriptures were able to make
him wise vnto salvation. what may wee thinke of S <hi>Paul?</hi>
was not he a good Christian? How doth he proue that and
approue himselfe? But this I confesse, &amp;c. Act. 24. 14. These

Iewes, before whom? <hi>Foelix</hi> a governour. In what cause, &amp;

the words he vsed? The spirit of God, for such was the
promise, To what end and purpose were they vttered? To
proue the truth of his religion, pietie and profession, where
of God was author, antiquitie an ornament, the Prophets
witnesses, and their records did containe the tenour: which
tenour is here made the touchstone of Gods truth and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

failed in performance of his promise; or the Scriptures suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to make a true and perfect Christian, such as <hi>Paul</hi> was
in this life, and an inheritour of salvation (as we doubt not

               <p>Further since the matter of our practise without the right
maner of performance, is but a carcase of religion without
a quickning spirit: the Scriptures make knowne vnto vs
that mans deed in Gods matters, is but a desire, at most an
endeavour, which endeavour must bee thus conditioned.
1. Sincere, for he with whom we haue to doe, requres
truth in the inward parts. 2. Serious, or earnest, for heaven
is the hold which none surprise, saue such as will take no
nay. 3. Setled or constant, because he that is holy must bee
holy still. 4. Vniversall or entire, for whosoever shall keepe
the whole law and yet offend in one point, he is guiltie of
all. Now what more sit rule or perfect square can be found
to frame the Lords building by, then that which laies the
foundation in sinceritie, reares vp the walls in fervency,
covers the whole by constancy, and keeps it holy by entire
obedience. Their madnesse hereby appeares the more, who
accuse the scriptures of want and imperfection, to the ende
