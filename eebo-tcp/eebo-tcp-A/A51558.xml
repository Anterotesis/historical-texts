            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:39340:3"/>I confess all this may seem matter of incredulity to those whose understanding is swayed by their visual sence, because they cannot perhaps conceive it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the Heaven which appears so small to the bare eye should be able to contain so great a number of such great bodies as is here spoken of; yet if those be capable to consider the vast distance of this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and consequently of the Stars placed in it from the face of the Earth, and also the Diminutive quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of distance, their reason will be rectified, and their incredulity turn'd into an acknowledgment of the unspeakable wisdom of Almighty God; and they will say with the <hi>Psalmist, Great is our Lord, Great is his Power, his Wisdom is Infinite, Psal.</hi> 147.5.</p>
               <p>The distance of the Stars therefore from the Earth, is according to Mr. <hi>John Dee's</hi> computation, 2008 1 ½ semidiameters of the Earth. The semidiameter of the Earth containeth of our common miles 3436 4/11, such miles as the whole Earth and Sea round about is 21600: allowing for every degree of the greatest cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle 60 miles, so that the distance of the Stars from the Earth is in miles 69006540, a distance so vastly great, that were there a path for a Footman to walk in of that length, he must have set forth 9452 years 347 days ago, and have travelled 20 miles every day to have been just now at his Journeys end.</p>
               <p>Now as Mr. <hi>Dee</hi> saith (almost in the same words) if you weigh well with your self this little parcel of fruit Astronomical, as concerning the bigness and distance of the Stars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the huge massiness of the Starry Heaven, you will find your Consciences moved with the Kingly Prophet to sing the confession of Gods Glory; and say, <hi>The Heavens declare the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

               <head>Of the Constellations in Heaven.</head>
               <p>A Constellation is a certain number of Stars placed by God Almighty neer one another in Heaven, and by Astronomers circumscribed in one Figure depi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted about them, as <hi>Aries</hi> the <hi>Ram</hi> is a Constellation. <hi>Taurus</hi> the <hi>Bull</hi> is another Constellation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers brought them into these figures, for instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions sake, things cannot be taught without names<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to give a name to every Star had been troublesom to the Master, and for the Schollar, for the Master to devise, and for the Schollar to remember; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Astronomers have reduced many Stars into one Constellation, that thereby they may tell the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter where to seek them, and being sought, how to express them. And they brought them into these fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, and none other, being moved thereto by these three Reasons: first these figures express some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the Stars that are in them; as those of the <hi>Ram</hi> to be hot and dry, <hi>Andromeda</hi> chained beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneth imprisonment: the head of <hi>Medusa</hi> cut off, signifieth the loss of that part: <hi>Orion</hi> with his terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and threatning gesture, importeth tempest, and terrible effects: The <hi>Serpent,</hi> the <hi>Scorpion,</hi> and the <hi>Dragon</hi> signifie poyson: The <hi>Bull,</hi> insinuateth a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly passion: The <hi>Bear</hi> inferreth cruelty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, the Stars (if not precisely, yet after a sort) do represent such a figure, and therefore that figure was assigned them: as for example, the <hi>Crown,</hi> both North and South; the <hi>Scorpion</hi> and the <hi>Triangle,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:39340:4"/>
the figures which they have. The third cause was the continuance of the memory of some notable men, who either in regard of their singular pains ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in Astronomy, or in regard of some other nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deed, had well deserved of mankind.</p>
               <p>The first Author of every particular Constellation is uncertain; yet are they of great antiquity; we receive them from <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> and he followed the <hi>Platonicks</hi>; so that their antiquity is great. Moreover we may perceive them to be ancient by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and by the Poets. In the 38 Chapter of <hi>Job</hi> there is mention made of the <hi>Pleiades, Orion,</hi> and <hi>Arcturus,</hi> and <hi>Mazzaroth,</hi> which some interpret the 12 Signs: <hi>Job</hi> lived in the time of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as <hi>Syde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocotes</hi> maketh mention in his Book <hi>de Commensuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis locorum distantiis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now besides all this, touching the reason of the invention of these Constellations the Poets had this purpose, <hi>viz.</hi> to make men fall in love with Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy: And to that intent have to every Constellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on invented strange conceited stories, (as you may read hereafter, therein imitating <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> who when he could not get the people of <hi>Athens</hi> to hear him in a matter of great moment, and profitable for the Common-wealth, he began to tell them a tale of a fellow that sold an Ass; by which tale he so brought on the <hi>Athenians,</hi> that they were both wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to hear his whole Oration, and to put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice what he exhorted them to. The like intent had the Poets in inventing of those stories: they saw that Astronomy being for its commodity singular in the life of man, was almost of all men utterly negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: Hereupon they began to set forth that Art un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:39340:5"/>
Fictions, that thereby such as could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded by commodity might by the pleasure be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to take a view of these matters; and thereby at length fall in love with them. For commonly you shall note this, that he that is ready to read the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, cannot content himself therewith, but desireth also to know the Constellation, or at leastwise some principal Star therein.</p>
               <p>All the Constellations formerly notified by the Antients, were in number 48, because no more were seen in our Hemisphere, though in this latter Age there are 12 more discovered about the South Pole, which because it may be somewhat more pleasant for reading, and much more helpful for your memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, I shall give you their Names in plain <hi>English</hi> Rhythmes.</p>

               <p>To many of the Principal Stars there is in planeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Characters prefixed their Planetical Natures. The Astrologers make great use of them for knowing the nature of the Stars; for those Stars that have the character of ♄ adjoined, are said to be of the nature of ♄; those that have ♃ adjoyned, are of the nature of ♃, and so of the rest. If a Star have the characters of two Planets adjoyned, that Star participates of both their Natures, but most of that Planets whose character is first placed.</p>
               <p>The use Astronomers make of those characters, is for knowing the colour of any Star; as if a Star have ♄ adjoyned, it is of the colour of ♄; if ♃, it is the colour of ♃, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <head>How you may learn to know all the Stars in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by these Playing Cards.</head>
               <p>To each of these Cards I have set down the day of the month that the Constellation in it rises at the Time of Sun-setting, as also the point of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass it rises on, so that if you will observe it, when the Sun sets, you will see the Constellation rising upon that point of the Compass set down on the Card with the letters of the point of the Compass.</p>
               <p>For Example.</p>
               <p>If you would know when the <hi>Little Dog</hi> rises in the Evening, look in the bottom of the Card, and you will find <hi>Jan.</hi> 11. E. by N. which shews that on the 11<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>January</hi> at Sun-set the Constellation of the <hi>Little Dog</hi> rises East and by North; therefore looking into that part of Heaven, you shall see the Constellation rising, and the Stars placed in Heaven, just as you find them placed on the Card. But if the Constellation be risen some considerable time, you must know the time since it rose, and estimate how high it may be above the Earth, by allowing about the twelfth part of Heaven for every hour since Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set, and about that esteemed height look for it, and when you find a number of Stars placed in Heaven like those on your Card, you may conclude that to be the Constellation, and to your great delight and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. See in what part of the Constellation each
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:39340:7"/>
particular Star lies, and of what Nature, Colour, and magnitude it is.</p>
               <p>These Cards are divided into four Suits, as other Playing Cards are, <hi>viz.</hi> Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs: And Astronomers have divided the whole face of Heaven into four Colures, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <list>
                     <item>The Vernal Colure, or Spring,</item>
                     <item>The Aestival Colure, or Summer,</item>
                     <item>The Autumnal Colure, or Autumne,</item>
                     <item>The Hyemnal Colure, or Winter.</item>
                  </list>
Because when the Sun comes to any of these Colures, the Season of the year alters into Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter; and so have I divided these Cards; for all the Constellations that are in the Vernal Colure are known by the suit of Spades, in the Aestiral Colure are Hearts, in the Autumnal Colure Diamonds, and in the Hyemnal Colure are Clubs, which are placed on the top at the left hand of every Card; and the number of each suit is marked on the top of the Card close by it with Numerical Letters thus, I, II, III, IV, V, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to X, and the Kings, Queens, and Knaves of each suite are also depicted on the top in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Card.</p>

               <p>This Circle is not set down on the Cards, because it takes up the whole compass of Heaven, but it is so plain to be seen every clear night, that it needs no pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:39340:7"/>
Yet I shall tell you what Constellations it pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth through, so that you may easily find any part of it that is above the Horizon when you please.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VIA LACTEA,</hi> or <hi>Circulus Lacteus</hi> by the Latines so called; and by the Greeks <hi>Galaxia,</hi> and by the English the <hi>Milkey way.</hi> It is a broad white Circle that is seen in the Heaven: In the North Hemisphere, it beginneth at <hi>Cancer,</hi> on each side the head thereof, and passeth by <hi>Auriga,</hi> by <hi>Perseus,</hi> and <hi>Cassiopeia,</hi> the <hi>Swan,</hi> and the head of <hi>Capricorn,</hi> the tail of <hi>Scorpio,</hi> and the feet of <hi>Centaur, Argo</hi> the <hi>Ship,</hi> and so unto the head of <hi>Cancer.</hi> Some in a sporting manner do call it <hi>Watling-street,</hi> but why they call it so, I cannot tell, except it be in regard of the narrowness that it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to have, or else in respect of that great High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way that lyeth between <hi>Dover</hi> and St. <hi>Albans,</hi> which is called by our men <hi>Watling-street.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning this Circle as there are sundry opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, so there is great difference among some writers, both touching the place, matter, and efficient cause thereof: <hi>Aristotle</hi> dissenteth from all other, both Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers and Poets, in the place, matter, and cause of this Circle; saying that it is a Meteor ingendred in the Air, made of the vapors of the earth, drawn up thither by the heat of the Sun, and there set on fire. But his opinion is of all men confuted.</p>
               <p>First, touching the place, it cannot be in the Air, whatsoever is in the Air, is not seen of all men, at all times, to be under one and the same part of Heaven; If we see it in the South, they that are in the West shall see it under the East side of the Heaven; and they that are in the East, shall see it in the West part of the Heaven, but this Circle is of all men seen always
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:39340:8"/>
under the same part of Heaven, and to be joined with the same Stars: therefore it cannot be in the Air.</p>
               <p>Again, for the matter, it cannot be made of that which <hi>Aristotle</hi> nameth (<hi>i. e</hi>) the vapours of the Earth because of the long continuance of the thing, and that without any alteration: for it is impossible that any Meteor made of vapours drawn up from the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or exhalations from the Earth, should last so long; as may be seen in Blazing Stars; which though they have continued long, as namely 16 months, some more, some less; yet at the length they have vanished away; whereas this Circle hath continued from the beginning unto this day. Besides, put case it were made of these exhalations; whence will they infer the uniformity thereof? The Comets do alter diversly, both in the fashion of their Blazing, and also in their several quantities, whereas in this Circle there is nothing but the same part, always of one form, and of one bigness. In the efficient cause thereof he must needs erre: for if it be neither in the Air, nor made of the exhalations of the Earth, it cannot be caused by the Sun; for the one is the place, and the other the matter, wherein, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Sun sheweth his power.</p>
               <p>All other (besides <hi>Aristotle</hi>) agree in the place, but differ in the efficient cause thereof: and rhey are either Philosophers, or Poets. Both these affirm that it is in the Firmament, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) in the eight Sphere; but they disagree in the cause thereof.</p>
               <p>The Philosophers, (and chiefly <hi>Democritus</hi>) affirm the cause of the thing, to be the exceeding great number of Stars in that part of Heaven, whose beams meeting together so confusedly, and not coming di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:39340:8"/>
to the eye, causeth us to imagine such a whiteness as is seen. But the best opinion is this, that this <hi>Milkey way</hi> is a part of the Firmament, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so thin as the other parts thereof are, nor yet so thick as the Stars themselves. If it were as thin as the other parts of the Heaven besides the Stars, then could it not retain the light, but the light would pass through it and not be seen; if it were as thick as the Stars, then would the light be so doubled in it, that it would glister and shine, as the Stars them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves do: but being neither so thin as the one, nor so thick as the other, it becometh of that whiteness we see. Thus far Dr. <hi>Hood.</hi> But</p>
               <p>Our modern Philosophers conceive this <hi>Lactean</hi> whiteness ariseth from a great number of little Stars constipated in that part of Heaven, flying so swiftly from the sight of our eyes, that we can perceive no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a confused light; this the <hi>Telescope</hi> (more lately found out) doth evidently demonstrate to us: by the benefit of which, little Stars (otherwise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conspicuous to our eyes) are there clearly discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>About the Southern Pole are seen two white spots, like little Clouds, coloured like the <hi>Via Lactea.</hi> One of which is trebble the latitude of the other; some Mariners call them <hi>Nubeculae Magellani.</hi>

                  <hi>URSA MINOR,</hi> This Constellation hath the preheminence, because it is nearest of all the rest unto the North Pole; and is called of the <hi>Greeks Arctos,</hi> whereupon the Pole is called the Pole Artick, for that it is near unto this Constellation. It is also called <hi>Helice minor,</hi> because of the small Revolution which it maketh round about the Pole: or rather of <hi>Elice,</hi> a Town in <hi>Arcadia,</hi> wherein <hi>Calisto</hi> the great Bear, and Mother to the less, was bred. It is called
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:39340:10"/>
                  <hi>Cynosura,</hi> because this Constellation, though it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the name of a Bear, yet it hath the tail of a Dog: Last of all, it is termed <hi>Phaenice,</hi> because that <hi>Thales,</hi> who first gave the name to this Constellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was a <hi>Phaenician:</hi> And therefore the <hi>Phaenicians</hi> being taught how to use it in their Navigations, did call it by the name of the Countrey wherein <hi>Thales</hi> was born: It consisteth of Seven Stars, which the Latines call <hi>Septentriones,</hi> because by their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al motions those Seven Stars do as it were wear the Heaven. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> do call them all <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sina,</hi> that is an <hi>Horn</hi>; because they may be very well brought into that form; whereof that which is the end of the Tail is called the <hi>Pole-Star,</hi> by reason of the nearness thereof unto the Pole of the World; for it is distant (according to the opinion of most) from the true Pole, but 3 degrees 30 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes. The <hi>Arabians</hi> call it <hi>Alrukaba.</hi> And of the <hi>Scythians</hi> it is said to be an <hi>Iron nail,</hi> and is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped by them as a God. The two Stars that are in the shoulders of the <hi>Bear,</hi> are called the <hi>Guards,</hi> of the <hi>Spanish</hi> word <hi>Guardare,</hi> which is to behold; because they are diligently to be looked unto, in regard of their singular use which they have in Navigation.</p>
               <p>The reason why this Constellation was brought into the Heavens is diversly set down, and first in this manner; <hi>Saturn</hi> having received of the Oracle that one of his Sons should banish him out of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, determined with himself to kill all the Men-children that he should beget; whereupon he gave command to <hi>Ops</hi> his Wife, being then great, that she should shew him the Child so soon as ever it was
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:39340:10"/>
born: But she bringing forth <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and being greatly delighted with his hair, gave the Child unto two Nymphs of <hi>Creet,</hi> dwelling in the Mount <hi>Dicte,</hi> whereof this was one, and was called <hi>Cynosura,</hi> the other was <hi>Helice.</hi>

                  <hi>Jupiter,</hi> after that (according to the Oracle) he had bereft his Father of his Kingdom, in recompence of their pains and curtesy, translated them both into the Heavens, and made of them two Constella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the <hi>lesser Bear,</hi> and the <hi>greater Bear.</hi>

               <p>Other-some say, that it was <hi>Arcas</hi> the son of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listo,</hi> and they tell the Tale on this manner; <hi>Calisto</hi> a Nymph of singular Beauty, Daughter to <hi>Lycaon</hi> King of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> induced by the great desire she had of hunting, became a follower of the Goddess <hi>Diana.</hi> After this, <hi>Jupiter</hi> being enamoured with her Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and out of hope, by reason of her profession, to win her love, in his own person, counterfeited the shape of <hi>Diana,</hi> lay with <hi>Calista,</hi> and got her with Child, of whom was born a Son which was called <hi>Arcas. Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> or rather <hi>Juno,</hi> being very much offended here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, turned <hi>Calisto</hi> into a <hi>Bear. Arcas</hi> her Son at the age of fifteen, hunting in the Woods, by chance light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on his Mother in the shape of a <hi>Bear,</hi> who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Son <hi>Arcas,</hi> stood still that he might come near unto her, and not be afraid: but he fearing the shape of so cruel a Beast, bent his Bow of purpose to have slain her: whereupon <hi>Jupiter</hi> to prevent the mischief, translated them both into Heaven, and of them made two several Constellations: unto the <hi>Lesser Bear</hi> there belongs but one Star unformed.</p>

This was the Dragon that kept the Golden Apples in the Orchard of the <hi>Hesperides,</hi> (now thought to be the Islands of <hi>Cape de Virde</hi>) and for his diligence and watchfulness, was afterwards Translated into Heaven: Yet others say that he came into Heaven by this occasion; when <hi>Minerva</hi> withstood the <hi>Gyants</hi> fighting against the <hi>Gods</hi>; they to terrifie her, threw at her a mighty <hi>Dragon,</hi> but she catching him in her hands, threw him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently up into Heaven, and placed him there, as a memorial of that her resistance.

For as much therefore as they must of likelihood be both slain, <hi>Calisto</hi> by her Son, and he by the Law, <hi>Jupiter</hi> to avoid this mischief, of meer pity took them both up into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Unto this Constellation belongeth but one Star unformed, and it is between the legs of <hi>Bootes,</hi> and by the <hi>Grecians</hi> it is called <hi>Arcturus,</hi> because of all the stars near the great <hi>Bear</hi> named <hi>Arctos,</hi> this star is first seen near her tail in the evening.

standing as it were in the hand of <hi>Auriga</hi>; this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellation is called <hi>Haedi,</hi> the <hi>Kids.</hi> The tale is thus; <hi>Saturn</hi> (as you heard before) had received of the Oracle, that one of his Sons should put him out of his Kingdom, whereupon he determined to devour them all: <hi>Ops</hi> by stealth conveyed away <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and sent him to <hi>Melissus</hi> King of <hi>Crete,</hi> to be nourished. <hi>Melissus</hi> having 2 daughters, <hi>Amalthaea,</hi> and <hi>Melissa,</hi> commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Jupiter</hi> unto their Nursery; <hi>Amalthaea</hi> had a <hi>Goat</hi> that gave suck unto 2 Kids, so that by the milk of this <hi>Goat,</hi> she nourished <hi>Jupiter</hi> very well: To requite this her care and courtesie, <hi>Jupiter</hi> (after he had put his Father out of his Kingdom) translated her <hi>Goat</hi> and her two <hi>Kids</hi> into Heaven, and in remembrance of the Nurse, the <hi>Goat</hi> is called <hi>Capra Amalthaea. Novi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> saith, that when Christ was born, and his birth made manifest by the Angels unto the Shepherds, one of them brought with him for a Present, a <hi>Goat</hi> and two young <hi>Kids</hi>; which in token of his good will, were placed in Heaven.</p>

Others deliver the Tale in these words; <hi>Glaucus</hi> the son of <hi>Minos</hi> King of <hi>Crete,</hi> was by mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune drowned in a Barrel of Honey: <hi>Minas</hi> his Father craved the help of <hi>Aesculapius</hi> the Physician: and that he might be driven perforce to help the Child, he shut him up in a secret place, together with the dead Carcass: whiles <hi>Esculapius</hi> stood in a great maze with himself what were best to be done, upon a sudden there came a Serpent creeping towards him, the which Serpent he slew with the Staff which he had in his hand. After this there came another Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in, bringing in his mouth a certain herb, which he laid upon the head of the dead Serpent, whereby he restored him unto life again. <hi>Esculapius</hi> using the same herb, wrought the same effect upon <hi>Glaucus.</hi> Whereupon (after that) <hi>Esculapius</hi> (whom some af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm to be <hi>Ophiucus</hi>) was placed in the Heaven and the <hi>Serpent</hi> with him.</p>

transforming himself into the form of an <hi>Eagle</hi> took <hi>Ganimedes</hi> the <hi>Trojan Boy,</hi> whom he greatly loved up into Heaven, and therefore in sign thereof: (because by that means he performed his purpose) he placed the figure of the Eagle in Heaven.

The Tale goeth thus concerning this Constellation.

               <p>Others say, that when <hi>Bacchus</hi> had transformed the Marriners that would have betrayed him, into <hi>Dolphins,</hi> he placed one of them in Heaven, that it might be a lesson for others to take heed how they carried any one out of his way, contrary both to his desire, and their own promise. <hi>Novidius</hi> referreth

The Poetical reason of his translation into the Heavens, shall be shewn in the <hi>Scorpion</hi> amongst the Zodiacal Constel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. The Ancient <hi>Romans</hi> called this Constella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Jugala,</hi> because it is most pestiferous unto Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, and as it were the very cut-throat of them. There
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:39340:17"/>
are bright Stars in his girdle, which we commonly call our <hi>Ladies yard,</hi> or <hi>wand. Novidius,</hi> applying this sword of <hi>Orion</hi> unto Scripture, will have it to be the Sword of <hi>Saul,</hi> afterwards called <hi>Paul,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he persecuted the Members of Christ: which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Conversion was placed in Heaven. In his left shoulder there is a very bright Star, which in <hi>Latine</hi> is called <hi>Bellatrix</hi> the <hi>Warriour,</hi> in the Faeminine Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. I cannot find the reason except it be this; that Women born under this Constellation shall have mighty tongues: the reason of the <hi>Ox hide</hi> which he hath in his hand, may be Gathered out of the next story.</p>
               <p n="3">3. FLUVIUS, the <hi>River</hi>; it comprehendeth 34 Stars: It is called by some <hi>Eridanus,</hi> or <hi>Pagus</hi>; they say that it was placed in Heaven in remembrance of <hi>Phaeton,</hi> who having set the whole Earth on fire by reason of misguiding his Father <hi>Phoebus</hi> his Chariot, was slain by <hi>Jupiter</hi> with a thunder-bolt, and tumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down from Heaven, fell into the River <hi>Eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danus,</hi> or <hi>Padus,</hi> which the <hi>Italians</hi> call <hi>Po.</hi> Others say that it is <hi>Nilus,</hi> and that that figure was placed in Heaven because of the excellency of that River, which by the Divines is called <hi>Gihon,</hi> and is one of the Rivers of <hi>Paradice.</hi> Others call it <hi>Flumen Orionis</hi> the flood of <hi>Orion</hi>; and say that it was placed there, to betoken the off-spring from whence <hi>Orion</hi> came: for the tale is thus reported of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jupiter, Neptune,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> travelling upon the Earth in the likness of Men, were requested by <hi>Hyerus</hi> to take a poor lodging at his house for a Night: they being overtaken with the evening, yeild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto his request; <hi>Hyreus</hi> made them good cheer,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:39340:18"/>
killing an Ox for their better entertainment: The Gods seeing the good heart of the old man, willed him to demand what he would in recompence of his so friendly cheer. <hi>Hyerus</hi> and his Wife being old, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested the Gods to gratify them with a Son. They to fulfil his desire, called for the hide of the <hi>Ox</hi> that was slain, and having received it, they put it into the Earth, and made water into it all three toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and covering it, willed <hi>Hyreus</hi> within ten months after to dig it out of the Earth again; which he did and found therein a Man-child; whom he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Ourion, ab Urania,</hi> of piss; although afterwards by leaving out the second letter, he was named <hi>Orion.</hi> At such time therefore as he was placed in Heaven, this flood was joyned hard to his heels, and the Ox hide wherein the Gods did piss, was set in the left hand, in memorial of his Off-spring.</p>
               <p n="4">4. LEPUS, the <hi>Hare,</hi> which consisteth of 12 Stars. This Constellation was placed in Heaven between the legs of <hi>Orion,</hi> to signifie the great delight in hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which he had in his life time: but others think it was a frivolous thing, to say that so notable a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low as <hi>Orion</hi> would trouble himself with so small and timorous a Beast as the <hi>Hare</hi>; and therefore they tell the tale thus.</p>
               <p>In times past there was not a <hi>Hare</hi> left in the Isle <hi>Leros</hi>; a certain youth therefore of that Island, being very desirous of that kind of beast, brought with him from another Country thereabout, an <hi>Hare</hi> great with young; which when she had brought forth, they in time became so acceptable unto the other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try men, that every one almost desired to have and keep a <hi>Hare.</hi> By reason whereof, the number of them
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:39340:18"/>
grew to be so great, within a short space after, that the whole Island became full of <hi>Hares,</hi> so that their Masters were not able to find them meat: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>Hares</hi> breaking forth into the fields, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured their Corn. Wherefore the Inhabitants being bitten with hunger; joyned together with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and (though with much adoe) destroyed the <hi>Hares. Jupiter</hi> therefore placed this Constellation in the Heavens; as well to express the exceeding fearfulness of the Beast, as also to teach men this les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; that there is nothing so much to be desired in this life, but that at one time or another bringeth with it more grief than pleasure. Some say, that it was placed in Heaven at the request of <hi>Ganimedes,</hi> who was greatly delighted with hunting the <hi>Hare.</hi>

               <p n="5">5. CANIS MAJOR, the <hi>Great Dog,</hi> it consisteth of 18 Stars. It is called <hi>Sirius Canis,</hi> because he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth a mighty drought by reason of his heat. This is the Constellation that giveth name unto the <hi>Canical</hi> or <hi>Dog days</hi>; whose beginning and end is not alike in all places, but hath a difference according to the Countrey and time: as in the Time of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> the Physitian, who lived before the time of Christ 400 years, the <hi>Canicular</hi> days began 13 or 14 of <hi>July.</hi> In the time of <hi>Avicenna,</hi> the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who lived in the year of Lord 1100. the <hi>Canicular</hi> days began the 15, 16, or 17 of <hi>July.</hi> In our Country; they begin about St. <hi>James-tide,</hi> but we use to account from the 6 of <hi>July,</hi> to the 17 of <hi>August</hi>; which is the time when the Sun beginneth to come near unto and to depart from this Constellation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Novidius</hi> will have it to be referred to <hi>Tobias</hi> Dog which may very well be, because he hath a tail; <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bias</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:39340:19"/>
Dog had one; as a certain fellow once concluded, because it is written that <hi>Tobias</hi> his Dog fawned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Master, therefore it is to be noted (said he) that he had a tail. The Poets say, that this is the Dog whom <hi>Jupiter</hi> set to keep <hi>Europa,</hi> after he had stolen her away, and conveyed her into <hi>Creet,</hi> and for his good service was placed in Heaven. Others say, that it was one of <hi>Orion</hi> his Dogs. There belong unto this Constellation 11 Stars unformed.</p>
               <p n="6">6. CANIS MINOR, the <hi>Lesser Dog</hi>; this of the Greeks is called <hi>Procyon,</hi> of the Latines <hi>Anteca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi>; it containeth but two Stars. Some say, that this was also one of <hi>Orion's</hi> Dogs. Others rather affirm it to be <hi>Mera</hi> the Dog of <hi>Origone,</hi> or rather of <hi>Icarius</hi> her Father, of whom mention is made in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellation of <hi>Bootes</hi> and <hi>Virgo.</hi> This Dog of meer love to his Master, being slain, as aforesaid, threw himself into the River <hi>Anygrus,</hi> but was afterward translated into Heaven, with <hi>Origone.</hi> Among the Poets there is great dissention which of the two should be the Dog of <hi>Origone,</hi> some saying one, and some the other, and therefore they do many times take the one for the <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">

               <p n="7">7. ARGO NAVIS, the <hi>Ship Argo</hi> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth 41 Stars; this is the Ship wherein <hi>Jason</hi> did fetch the golden fleece from <hi>Colchis,</hi> which was afterward placed in Heaven as a memorial, not only because of the great Voyage, but also, because (as some will have it) it was the first Ship wherein any man sailed. Their reason why this Ship is not made whole is that thereby men might be put in mind not to despair, albeit that their Ship miscarry'd in some part now and then: some avouch it to be the <hi>Ark</hi> of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:39340:19"/>
                  <hi>Noah. Novidius</hi> saith it is the Ship wherein the <hi>Apostles</hi> were, when Christ appeared unto them walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Sea. In one of the Oars of this Ship there is a great Star, called <hi>Canopus,</hi> or <hi>Canobus,</hi> which the <hi>Arabians</hi> called <hi>Shuel,</hi> as it were a bone-fire because of the greatness thereof. It is not seen in <hi>Italy,</hi> nor in any Country on this side of <hi>Italy:</hi> Some say that <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobus</hi> the Master of <hi>Menelaus,</hi> his Ship was transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into this Star.</p>
               <p n="8">8. HYDRA, the <hi>Hydra,</hi> that hath 25 Stars and two unformed.</p>
               <p n="9">9. CRATER, the <hi>Cup,</hi> or <hi>Standing-piece</hi>; that hath seven Stars, some say that this was the Cup where in <hi>Tagathon,</hi> that is the chief God, ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Stuff whereof he made the Souls of Men.</p>
               <p n="10">10. CORVUS, the <hi>Crow</hi>; this hath seven Stars. These 3 Constellations are to be joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, because they depend upon one History, which is this. Upon a time <hi>Apollo</hi> made a solemn feast to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi> and wanting water to serve his turn, he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered a Cup to the <hi>Crow</hi> (the bird wherein he chiefly delighted) and sent him to fetch water therein. The <hi>Crow</hi> flying towards the River, espied a Fig-tree, fell in hand with the Figs, and abode there till they were ripe: In the end when, he had fed his fill of them, and satisfied his longing, he bethought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of his errand, and by reason of his long delay, fearing a Check, he caught up a snake in his bill, brought it to <hi>Apollo,</hi> and told him that the snake would not let him fill the <hi>Cup</hi> with water, <hi>Apollo</hi> seeing the impudence of the bird, gave him this gift, that as long as the Figs were not ripe upon the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:39340:20"/>
Tree so long he should never drink: and for a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of the silly excuse that she made, he placed both the <hi>Crow, Cup,</hi> and <hi>Snake,</hi> in Heaven.</p>
               <p n="11">11. CENTAURUS, the <hi>Centaure,</hi> which comprehendeth 37 Stars. Some say, that this is <hi>Typhon,</hi> others call him <hi>Chiron,</hi> the Schoolmaster of those three excellent men, <hi>Hercules, Achilles,</hi> and <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culapius</hi>: unto <hi>Hercules</hi> he read <hi>Astronomy,</hi> he trained <hi>Achilles</hi> in <hi>Musick,</hi> and <hi>Aesculapius,</hi> in <hi>Physick</hi>: and for his upright life he was turned into this Constella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Yet <hi>Virgil</hi> calleth <hi>Sagittarius</hi> by the name of <hi>Chiron.</hi> In the hinder feet of this Constellation, those Stars are set which are called the <hi>Crosiers,</hi> appearing to the Marriners as they sail towards the South Sea, in the form of a Cross, whereupon they have their name. The four Stars which are in the Garnish of the <hi>Centaurs</hi> Spear, are accounted by <hi>Proclus</hi> as a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Constellation, and are called by him <hi>Thyrsilochus</hi> which was a Spear compassed about with vine leaves: but they are called by <hi>Copernicus,</hi> and <hi>Clavius,</hi> and other Astronomers, the Stars of his Target. It should seem that they were deceived by the old translation of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> wherein <hi>Scutum</hi> is put for <hi>Hasta (i. e.</hi>) the Target, for the Spear, as it is well noted by our Country-man Mr. <hi>R.

LUPUS, the <hi>Wolfe,</hi> or the beast which the <hi>Centaur</hi> holdeth in his hand, contaneth 19 Stars; the Poetical reason is this, <hi>Chiron</hi> the <hi>Centaur</hi> being a just man, was greatly given to the worship of the Gods: for which thing, that it might be notified to all posterity, they placed him by this beast, which he seemeth to stick and thrust through with his

Spear (as it were) ready to kill for Sacrifice.</p>
               <p n="13">13. ARA, the <hi>Altar,</hi> it is also called <hi>Lar,</hi> or <hi>Thuribulum (i. e.</hi>) a Chimney with the fire, or a Censor. It consisteth of seven Stars, and is affirmed of some Poets to be the <hi>Altar</hi> whereon the <hi>Centaur</hi> was wont to offer up his sacrifice. But others tell the tale thus. When as the great Gyants called the <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> laboured as much as might be to pull <hi>Jupiter</hi> out of Heaven, the Gods thought it good to lay their heads together, to advise what was best to be done: Their conclusion was, that they should all with one consent join hands together to keep out such fellows, and that this their league might be confirmed, and throughly ratified, they caused the <hi>Cyclops</hi> (which were workmen of <hi>Vulcan</hi>) to make them an Altar: about this Altar all the Gods assembled, and there sware, that with one consent they would withstand their enemies; afterwards, having gotten the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it pleased them to place this Altar in Heaven as a memorial of their League, and a token of that good which unity doth breed.</p>
               <p n="14">14. CORONA AUSTRINA, the <hi>South Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> it hath 13 Stars. Some say that it is some tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling <hi>Garland</hi> which <hi>Sagittarius</hi> was wont to wear, but he cast it away from him in jest, and therefore it was placed between his legs; others call it the Wheel of <hi>Ixon,</hi> whereupon he was tormented for that great discourtesie he would have offered unto <hi>Juno,</hi> thinking indeed to have gotten up her Belly: but <hi>Jupiter</hi> seeing the impudency of the man, tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him out of Heaven (where by the license of the gods he was sometimes admitted as a guest) into Hell there to be continually tormented upon a Wheel:
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:39340:21"/>
The Figure of which Wheel was afterwards placed in Heaven, to teach men to take heed how they be too saucie to make such courteous proffers unto other mens wives.

This was translated into Heaven in memorial of the Rape committed by <hi>Jupiter</hi> on <hi>Europa</hi> the daughter of <hi>Agenor,</hi> King of <hi>Sidon</hi>; whom <hi>Jupiter</hi> in the likeness of a white Bull stole away, and transport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into <hi>Candia.</hi> Others say, That it was <hi>Io</hi> the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Inacus,</hi> whom <hi>Jupiter</hi> loved, and turned into the form of a Cow, to the intent that <hi>Juno</hi> coming at unawares, should not perceive what a part he had played: <hi>Jupiter</hi> afterward in memorial of that crafty conveyance, placed that Figure in Heaven; The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why the Poets name not certainly whether it be a Cow or a Bull, is because it wanteth the hinder parts; yet of the most of them it is called a <hi>Bull.</hi> In the Neck of the <hi>Bull</hi> there are certain Stars standing together in a cluster, which are commonly called the <hi>seven Stars</hi>; although there can hardly be discerned any more than six, these are reported to be the seven daughters of <hi>Atlas,</hi> called <hi>Atlantiades,</hi> whereof 6 had company with the immortal Gods, but the 7<hi>th.</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:39340:22"/>
(whose name was <hi>Merope</hi>) being married unto <hi>Sysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> a mortal man, did therefore withdraw and hide her self, as being ashamed that she was not so fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in matching herself as her sisters were. Some say that that star which is wanting is <hi>Electra,</hi> eldest Daughter of <hi>Atlas,</hi> and that therefore it is so dim, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she could not abide to behold the destruction of <hi>Troy</hi>; but at that time and ever since, she hid her face. The reason why they were taken up into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, was their great pity towards their Father, whose mishap they bewailed with continual tears. Others say, that whereas they had vowed perpetual Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and were in danger to lose it, by reason of <hi>Orion,</hi> who greatly assailed them, being overtaken with their love; they requested <hi>Jupiter</hi> to stand their friend; who translated them into Stars, and placed them in that part of Heaven. The Poets call them <hi>Pleiades,</hi> because when they rise with the Sun, the Mariners may commit themselves to the Sea. Others will have them to be so termed <hi>a pluendo,</hi> because they procure rain. Others give them this name, of the Greek word <hi>Cleiones,</hi> because they be many in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; they be also called <hi>Virgiliae,</hi> because they rise with the Sun in the <hi>Spring time:</hi> likewise <hi>Athoraiae,</hi> because they stand so thick together. Our men call them by the name of the <hi>seven Stars,</hi> or <hi>Brood Hen.</hi> The Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers note this as a special thing concerning these stars, that when the Moon and these Stars do meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the eyes are not to be medled withal, or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red if they before: their reason is, because they be of the nature of <hi>Mars</hi> and the <hi>Moon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, there be five stars in the face of the <hi>Bull,</hi> representing the form of the <hi>Roman</hi> letter V, whereof
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:39340:22"/>
one (which is the greatest) is called the <hi>Bulls Eye,</hi> They be called <hi>Hyades,</hi> and were also the daughters of <hi>Atlas,</hi> who so long bewailed the death of <hi>Hyas</hi> their Brother, slain by a <hi>Lyon,</hi> that they died for sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and were afterwards placed in Heaven, for a memorial of that great love they bare to their Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The ancient <hi>Romans</hi> call the <hi>Bulls Eye Parilici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> or <hi>Palelicium</hi>; of <hi>Pales</hi> their goddess, whose feast they celebrated after the conjunction of this Star and the Sun. The unformed Stars belonging unto this Constellation, are eleven.</p>
               <p n="3">3. GEMINI, the <hi>Twins</hi> consisteth of 18 stars. The Poets say, they are <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> the sons of <hi>Leda,</hi> brethren most loving, whom therefore <hi>Jupiter</hi> translated into Heaven. Some say that one of them is <hi>Apollo,</hi> and the other <hi>Hercules:</hi> but the most affirm the former. The unformed Stars of this Constellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are seven, whereof one is called <hi>Tropus,</hi> because it is placed next before the foot of <hi>Castor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. CANCER, the <hi>Crab,</hi> it hath 9 Stars. This is that <hi>Crab</hi> which bit <hi>Hercules</hi> by the heel as he fought with the Serpent <hi>Hydra</hi> in the Fen <hi>Lerna,</hi> and for his forward service, was placed in Heaven by <hi>Juno,</hi> the utter enemy of <hi>Hercules.</hi> In this Constellation there are Stars much spoken of by the Poets; although they be but small, whereof one is called the <hi>Crib,</hi> other two are the two <hi>Asses,</hi> whereof one was the <hi>Ass</hi> of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> the other of <hi>Vulcan,</hi> whereon they rode to Battel, when as the Gyants made War with the Gods; with whose braying and strange noise, the Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants were so scared upon the sudden, that they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook the field, and fled. The Gods getting the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in triumphing manner translated both the <hi>Asses,</hi>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:39340:23"/>
and their manger into Heaven. The unformed Stars of this Constellation are four. It is called <hi>animal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rrogradum,</hi> for when the Sun cometh into this Sign, he maketh Retrogradation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. LEO, the <hi>Lyon</hi>; it hath 27 Stars, this is that <hi>Lion</hi> which <hi>Hercules</hi> overcame in the wood <hi>Nemaea,</hi> and was placed in Heaven in remembrance of so notable a deed. <hi>Novidius</hi> saith, this was one of the <hi>Lyons</hi> that were in the den into which <hi>Daniel</hi> was cast, and was therefore placed in Heaven, because of all other he was most friendly unto <hi>Daniel.</hi> In the breast of this Constellation is that notable great Star, the light whereof is such, as that therefore it is called by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomers <hi>Bazileus</hi> or <hi>Regulus (i. e.)</hi> the <hi>Viceroy</hi> or little King among the rest. The unformed Stars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the <hi>Lyon</hi> are eight, whereof three make the Constellation which is now called <hi>Coma Berenices</hi> that is, the hair of <hi>Berenice.</hi> This Constellation was first found out and invented by <hi>Canon</hi> the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician, but described by <hi>Calimachus</hi> the Poet. The occasion of the story was this. <hi>Ptolomeus Euergetes</hi> having married his sister <hi>Berenice,</hi> was shortly after enforced to depart from her, by reason of the Wars he had begun in <hi>Asia:</hi> whereupon <hi>Berenice</hi> made this Vow, that if he returned home again in safety, she would offer up her hair in <hi>Venus</hi> Temple. <hi>Ptolomy</hi> returned safe; and <hi>Berenice,</hi> according to her Vow, cut off her hair and hung it up. After certain days, the hair was not to be found; whereupon <hi>Ptolomy</hi> the King was greatly displeased; but <hi>Canon,</hi> to please the humor of the King, and to curry favour with him, perswaded him that <hi>Venus</hi> had conveyed the Hair into Heaven. <hi>Canon</hi> attributeth seven Stars unto
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:39340:23"/>
it, but <hi>Ptolomy</hi> allotteth it but three, because the other be insensible.</p>
               <p n="6">6. VIRGO, the <hi>Virgin,</hi> it hath 26 Stars. This is affirmed to be Justice, which among all the Gods sometime living upon the Earth, did last of all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the same, because of the wickedness that began to multiply therein, and chose this place for her seat in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Others say, that it was <hi>Astrea,</hi> the daughter of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streus,</hi> one of the Gyants that were called <hi>Titans,</hi> who fighting against the Gods, <hi>Astraea</hi> took their parts against her own Father, and was therefore after her death commended unto the Heavens, and made one of the 12 Signs.</p>
               <p>Others say, that it was <hi>Origone,</hi> the daughter of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carius,</hi> who for that her Father was slain by certain drunken men, for very grief thereof hanged her self: but <hi>Jupiter</hi> taking pity of the <hi>Virgin</hi> for her natural affection, translated her into Heaven.</p>
               <p>In her right wing there is one Star of special note, which by the Astronomers is called <hi>Vindemiator, (i. e.)</hi> the gatherer of Grapes. This was <hi>Ampulos</hi> the son of a Satyr and a Nymph, and greatly beloved of <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> unto whom in token of his love, <hi>Bacchus</hi> gave a singular fair Vine, planted at the foot of an Elm (as the manner was in old time.) But <hi>Ampelos</hi> in Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest gathering Grapes, and taking little heed to his footing, fell down out of the Vine, and brake his neck. <hi>Bacchus</hi> in memorial of his former affection, translated him into Heaven, and made him one of the principal Stars in this Constellation. There is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother great Star in the hand of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> called of the Latines <hi>Spica,</hi> of the Greeks <hi>Stachus,</hi> of the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:39340:24"/>
                  <hi>Azimech (i. e.)</hi> the <hi>Ear of Corn:</hi> whereby they signifie, that when the Sun cometh to this Sign, the Corn waxeth ripe. <hi>Albumazar</hi> the <hi>Arabian,</hi> and <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidius,</hi> take this Constellation for the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> The unformed Stars in this Constellation are six.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>LIBRA</hi> the <hi>Ballance,</hi> it containeth eight Stars, <hi>Cicero</hi> calleth <hi>Jugum</hi> the <hi>Yoke,</hi> and here it is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the ancient Astronomers that first set down the number of the Constellations contained in the Zodiack, did account but eleven therein, so that the Sign, which now is called <hi>Libra,</hi> was heretofore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Chelai,</hi> that is to say, <hi>the Claws of the Scorpion,</hi> which possesseth the space of two whole Signs. But the latter Astronomers, being desirous to have 12 Signs in the Zodiack, called those eight, whereof the <hi>Claws of the Scorpion</hi> do consist, by the name of <hi>Libra,</hi> not that there was any Poetical Fiction to induce them thereto, but only moved by this reason, because the Sun joyning with this Constellation, the Day and the Night are of an equal length, and are (as it were) equally poized in a pair of Ballances. Yet (as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member) some will have this to be the Ballance, wherein Justice, called also <hi>Astraea,</hi> weighed the deeds of mortal men, and therein presented them unto <hi>Jupiter.</hi> It hath 9 unformed Stars appertaining unto it.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>SCORPIO,</hi> the <hi>Scorpion,</hi> called of the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians, Alatrab</hi>; of <hi>Cicero, Nepa.</hi> It consisteth of 21 Stars. The Fiction is thus; <hi>Orion</hi> the son of <hi>Hyreus</hi> greatly beloved of <hi>Diana,</hi> was wont to make his boast: that he was able to overcome what Beast soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was bred upon the Earth: the Earth being moved with this speech brought forth the <hi>Scorpion,</hi> whereby
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:39340:24"/>
                  <hi>Orion</hi> was stung to death. <hi>Jupiter</hi> thereupon (at the request of the Earth) translated both the <hi>Scorpion</hi> and <hi>Orion</hi> into Heaven; to make it a lesson for ever, for mortal men not to trust too much unto their own strength; and to the end he might signify the great enmity between them, he placed them so in Heaven, that whensoever the one ariseth, the other setteth; and they are never both of them seen together above the Horizon at once: <hi>Gulielmus Postellus</hi> will have it to be the <hi>Serpent</hi> which beguiled <hi>Eve</hi> in <hi>Paradise.</hi> The unformed Stars about this <hi>Scorpion</hi> are three.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>SAGITTARIVS,</hi> the <hi>Archer.</hi> It hath 31 Stars. Touching this Sign, there are among the Poets ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and sundry opinions. Some say that it is <hi>Crocus,</hi> the son of <hi>Paphene,</hi> that was Nurse unto the Muses. This <hi>Crocus</hi> was so forward in learning of the Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sciences, and in the practice of feats of Activity, that the Muses entreated <hi>Jupiter</hi> that he might have a place in Heaven. To whose request <hi>Jupiter</hi> incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, made him one of the 12 Signs: And to the end that he might express the excellent qualities of the Man, he made his hinder parts like unto a Horse, thereby to signifie his singular knowledge in Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship: and by his Bow and Arrow, he declared the sharpness of his Wit. Whereupon the Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers have this conceit, that he that is born under <hi>Sagittarius,</hi> shall attain to the knowledge of many Arts, and be of prompt wit, and great courage. <hi>Virgil</hi> affirmeth this to be <hi>Chiron</hi> the <hi>Centaur,</hi> who for his singular Learning and Justice was made the Master of <hi>Achilles.</hi> At which time <hi>Hercules</hi> coming to visit him (for he had heard both of the worthiness of the School-master, and of the great hopes of the Scholar)
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:39340:25"/>
brought with him his quiver of Arrows dipped in the blood of the Serpent <hi>Hydra</hi>; but <hi>Chiron</hi> being desirous to see his shafts, and not taking heed of them being in his hand, let one of them fall upon his foot, and being greatly tormented, not only by the anguish of the Poyson working in the Wound, but much more because he knew himself to be immortal, and his wound not to be recovered by Medicine, he was enforced to make request unto the Gods, that he might be taken out of the World, who pitying his case, took him up into Heaven, and made him one of the 12 Signs.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>CAPRICORNVS,</hi> the <hi>Goat,</hi> it consisteth of 28 Stars. The Poets say, that this was <hi>Pan</hi> the God of the Shepherds, of whom they feign in this manner: The Gods having War with the Gyants, gathered themselves together into <hi>Aegypt, Typhon</hi> the Gyant pursued them thither, whereby the Gods were brought into a quandary, that well was he that by changing his shape might shift for himself. <hi>Jupiter</hi> turned himself into a <hi>Ram: Apollo</hi> became a <hi>Crow: Bacchus</hi> a <hi>Goat: Diana</hi> lurked under the form of a <hi>Cat: Juno</hi> transformed her self into a <hi>Cow: Venus</hi> into a <hi>Fish: Pan</hi> leaping into the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the upper part of his body into a <hi>Goat,</hi> and the lower part into a <hi>Fish. Jupiter</hi> wondring at the strange device, would needs have that Image and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture translated into Heaven, and made one of the 12 Signs. In that the hinder part of this Sign is like a Fish. It betokeneth that the latter part of the month wherein the Sun possesseth this Sign, inclineth unto Rain.</p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>AQVARIVS,</hi> the <hi>Waterman</hi>: it hath 42 Stars,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:39340:25"/>
whereof some make the Figure of the Man: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some the Water-pot; and some, the stream of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that runneth out of the pot. This is feigned to be <hi>Ganimedes</hi> the <hi>Trojan,</hi> the son of <hi>Oros</hi> and <hi>Callirhoe,</hi> whom <hi>Jupiter</hi> did greatly love for his excellent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and beauty, and by the service of his Eagle car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him up into Heaven, where he made him his Cup-bearer, and called him <hi>Aquarius.</hi> Others not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding think it to be <hi>Deucalion</hi> the son of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metheus</hi> whom the Gods translated into Heaven, in remembrance of that mighty deluge which hapned in his time; whereby mankind was almost utterly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away from the face of the earth. The unformed stars belonging unto this Sign are three.</p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>PISCES,</hi> the <hi>Fishes:</hi> these together with the line that knitteth them together, contain 24 Stars. The Poets say, that <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Cupid</hi> her son coming upon a certain time unto the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and sitting upon the bank thereof, upon a sudden espied <hi>Typhon</hi> the <hi>Gyant,</hi> that mighty and fearful enemy of the gods coming towards them; upon whose sight, they being stricken with exceeding fear, lept into the River, where they were received by two Fishes, and by them saved from drowning. <hi>Venus</hi> for this good turn, translated them into Heaven. <hi>Gulielmus Postel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> would have them to be the two Fishes wherewith Christ fed the 5000 Men. The unformed Stars of this Constellation are four.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus have I briefly run over the Poetical reasons of the Constellations: It remains now that I speak of the</hi> Milky Way.</p>
               <p>VIA LACTEA, or <hi>Circulus Lacteus</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the Latines so called; and by the <hi>Greeks Galaxia</hi>; and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:39340:26"/>
by the English the <hi>Milkey Way.</hi> It is a broad white Circle that is seen in the Heaven: In the North He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misphere, it beginneth at <hi>Cancer,</hi> on each side the head thereof, and passeth by <hi>Auriga, Perseus, Cassiopeia,</hi> the <hi>Swan,</hi> and the head of <hi>Capricorn,</hi> the tail of <hi>Scorpio</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the feet of <hi>Centaur, Argo</hi> the <hi>Ship,</hi> and so to the head of <hi>Cancer.</hi> Some in a sporting manner do call it <hi>Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-street,</hi> but why they call it so, I cannot tell; except it be in regard of the narrowness that it seemeth to have; or else in respect of that great high way that lyeth between <hi>Dover</hi> and St. <hi>Albons,</hi> which is called by our men <hi>Watling-street.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ovid</hi> saith, it is the great Causey, and High-way that leadeth unto the Pallace of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> but he alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the cause of the whiteness; belike he would have us imagine that it is made of White Marble.</p>
               <p>Others therefore alledg these causes: <hi>Jupiter</hi> having begotten <hi>Mercury</hi> of <hi>Maia</hi> the daughter of <hi>Atlas</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> brought the child when he was born, to the breast o<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Juno</hi> lying asleep: But <hi>Juno</hi> awaking threw the child out of her lap, and let the milk run out of her breast in such abundance, that (spreading it self about the Heaven) it made that Circle which we see. Others say, that it was not <hi>Mercury,</hi> but <hi>Hercules</hi>; and that <hi>Juno</hi> did not let the milk run out of her breast, but that <hi>Hercules</hi> suckt them so earnestly, that his mouth run over, and so this Circle was made.</p>
               <p>Others say, that <hi>Saturn</hi> being desirous to devour his children, his wife <hi>Ops</hi> presented him with a stone wrapped in a clout, instead of his Child: This stone stuck so fast in <hi>Saturn</hi>'s Throat as he would have swallowed it, that without doubt he had therewith been choaked, had he not been relieved by his wife<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:39340:26"/>
who by pressing the milk out of her breasts saved his life: the milk that missed his mouth (whereof you must suppose some sufficient quantity) fell on the Heavens, and running along made this Circle.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Hood Commenting upon Constellations saith</hi>; the Stars are brought into Constellations, for Instruction sake, things cannot be taught without names; to give a name to every Star had been troublesome to the Master, and for the Scholar; for the Master to devise, and for the Scholar to remember; and therefore the Astronomers have reduced many Stars into one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellation; that thereby they may tell the better where to seek them; and being sought, how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press them. Now the Astronomers did bring them into these Figures, and not into other, being moved thereto by these three reasons: first, these Figures express some properties of the Stars that are in them; as those in the <hi>Ram</hi> to be hot and dry; <hi>Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meda</hi> chained betokeneth imprisonment, the head of <hi>Medusa</hi> cut off signifieth the loss of that part: <hi>Orion</hi> with his terrible and threatning gesture, importeth tempest and terrible effects. The <hi>Serpent,</hi> the <hi>Scorpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and the <hi>Dragon,</hi> signifie Poyson: The <hi>Bull</hi> insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ateth a melancholy passion: The <hi>Bear</hi> inferreth cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, the Stars (if not precisely, yet after a sort) do represent such a Figure, and therefore that Figure was assigned them, as for example, the <hi>Crown,</hi> both North and South, the <hi>Scorpion</hi> and <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle,</hi> represent the figures which they have. The third cause was the continuance of the memory of some notable Men, who either in regard of their singular pains taken in Astronomy, or in regard of some other notable deed, had well deserved of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:39340:27"/>The first Author of every particular Constellation is uncertain; yet are they of great antiquity; we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them from <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> and he followed the <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks</hi>; so that their antiquity is great. Moreover, we may perceive them to be ancient by the Scriptures, and by the Poets. In the 38 Chapter of <hi>Job</hi> there is mention made of the <hi>Pleiades, Orion,</hi> and <hi>Arcturus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Mazzaroth,</hi> which some interpret the 12 Signs: <hi>Job</hi> lived in the time of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as <hi>Syderocrates</hi> maketh mention in his Book <hi>de Commensurandis locorum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now besides all this, touching the reason of inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of these Constellations, the Poets in setting forth those Stories, had this purpose, to make men fall in love with Astronomy: When <hi>Demosthenes</hi> could not get the people of <hi>Athens</hi> to hear him in a matter of great moment, and profitable to the Common-wealth he began to tell them a Tale of a fellow that sold an Ass; by which Tale he so wrought on the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> that they were both willing to hear his whole O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and to put in practise that whereunto he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them. The like intent had the Poets in these Stories: They saw that Astronomy being for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity singular in the life of Man, was almost of all men utterly neglected: Hereupon they began to set forth that Art under these Fictions; that thereby such as could not be perswaded by commodity, might by the Pleasure be induced to take a view of these matters, and thereby at length fall in love with them. For commonly note this, that he that is ready to read the Stories, cannot content himself therewith, but desireth also to know the Constellations, or at least wise some principal Star therein.</p>
