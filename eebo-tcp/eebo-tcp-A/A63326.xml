            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ACCOUNT
OF THE
Irregular Proceedings
At G<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ILD-HALL,
About the Swearing the
TWO
Pretended SHERIFFS
Mr. NORTH and Mr. RICH.
<date>September 28. 1682</date>
            </head>
            <p>THE laſt Night my Lord Mayor iſſued out Tickets to the Aldermen
in theſe Words:</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Sir;</hi> Your Worſhip is deſired to be at a Court of Aldermen at <hi>Guild-Hall</hi>
on Thurſday next at nine of the Clock in the forenoon, in your violet Gown
and Cloak, being the twenty eighth of <hi>September.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>Accordingly ſeveral Aldermen appeared at <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> and it being the day
appointed for the Swearing of Sheriffs, they attended <hi>Thomas Papillon</hi> and <hi>John
Dubois</hi> Eſquires into the <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> at the hour appointed by the Lord May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or,
which they found guarded by Foot-Companies of the Trained-Bands (a
thing expreſly contrary to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſtitutions, which hath been jealous
of nothing more than the preſerving Elections free from force or terrour;)
Some whereof were poſted at the Doors and preſented their Muskets: But
yet there was no refuſal of entrance, but rather an opening of the Files, and
ſome reſpect ſhewn. So all the aforeſaid Aldermen paſſed into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil-Chamber,
where having ſtaid a little while, and ſuppoſing my Lord May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
might go up to the <hi>Huſtings</hi> directly, they went down into the Hall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <hi>Huſtings</hi>-door, and there abode ſome time, attending his Lordſhips
coming, the Souldiers with reſpect giving way. But Lieutenant Collonel
<hi>Quiney</hi> who was abſent at their entry, came up to them very much concerned,
and made ſeveral turns without ſpeaking to them, but commanded the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
ſeveral times to ſtand to their Arms, and ſo withdrew. But after a
quarter of an hour he came back again and commanded the Souldiers to face
about (and ſo alter'd their Figure) and to advance ſo as to encompaſs or
impriſon the Aldermen, for there was not ſix foot ſquare left them to ſtand
upon. Whereupon <hi>Quiney</hi> ſaid to the Aldermen, <hi>I have a command from the
Lieutenancy to keep the Hall clear, and ſuffer none to be here till my Lord May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
comes.</hi> Upon this, ſeveral Aldermen demanded to ſee the Order, being rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to obey all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Legal commands; and asked him, whether he did not know
that <hi>they were Magiſtrates of the City; and could believe it reached them?</hi> To which
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51679:2"/>
he anſwered, <hi>I have none, but it is with the Major of the Regiment, and I do
know you, and you muſt remove.</hi> Further, the Aldermen declared, they were ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
to wait on my Lord Mayor at the <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> and there attended in
all peaceableneſs. Whereupon he withdrew again for ſome time, but returning,
ſaid, <hi>Gentlemen You <hi>muſt</hi> withdraw, I have a command to require it.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
again demanded to ſhew his Warrant or Order, he anſwered in a great
heat, That he <hi>would ſhew none, nor to none <hi>ſuch as they.</hi>
               </hi> Then laying hands
firſt on <hi>Sir P. W's.</hi> ſhoulder who ſtood next to him, he ſaid, <hi>Sir You muſt remove;</hi>
and called on his Souldiers to advance cloſe to the Bar, ſo as to thruſt them
away; <hi>Sir P. W.</hi> only replied to him, <hi>We are in a lawful place, and on our Duty,</hi>
deſiring the other Aldermen that were preſent, and the Souldiers, to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the violence offered. And ſurely it was ſuch as is ſcarcely to be Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell'd,
eſpecially in a well-governed City; that their Civil Magiſtrates ſhould
be ſo affronted in their own Room. But <hi>Quiney</hi> anſwered, <hi>he cared not for Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
he would juſtifie what he did, having Orders from the Lieutenancy ſo to do.</hi>
Then he took hold on <hi>Sir J. L.</hi> who was leaning on the Bar, and with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great and repeated violence pulled him from off the ſtep, and had like to
have thrown him down; who demanded ſtill <hi>by what Order he did it?</hi> and that
he would ſhew the ſame. But he replied again, <hi>he would ſhew none:</hi> Then
he took hold of <hi>Sir J. S.</hi> and <hi>Sir T. G.</hi> and Ald. <hi>C.</hi> who likewiſe demanding
to ſee his Orders, were anſwered to the ſame purpoſe as aforeſaid. Hereupon
all the Aldermen deſiring the Souldiers who were preſent to take notice of
the Aſſaults and Miſdemeanours of the ſaid <hi>Quiney,</hi> they withdrew into the
<hi>Weſt</hi> part of the Hall, where divers perſons were walking, <hi>viz. Withers, Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
Nicols, Steventon, &amp;c.</hi> ſome of them being of the Lieutenancy, and
others not. To whom it was ſaid, <hi>Did not you ſee the Miſdem<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>anours of</hi> Quiney?
But they inſtead of reſenting the indignities offered to thoſe worthy Aldermen,
who had ſerved the City to ſo great a degree that the mouth of malice it
ſelf may be ſtopt, anſwered, <hi>He followed but the Orders of the Lieutenancy.</hi>
Then it was asked them (being Acquaintance) <hi>How they came by that Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in the Hall, when the <hi>Aldermen</hi> were ſo ill treated there?</hi> Whereunto
they anſwered, <hi>they were of the Lieutenancy, and attended the coming of my Lord
Mayor:</hi> The which the Aldermen told them <hi>they alſo did, but had not the
ſame civil treatment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Not long after came my Lord Mayor, to whom theſe Aldermen joined them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and went up out of the Great Hall into the Council-Chamber, and
Mr.</hi> Papillon <hi>and Mr.</hi> Dubois <hi>with them: where being entred, the firſt words
my Lord Mayor ſaid, were theſe,</hi> viz: Gentlemen, here are fine doings, to go and
Swear Sheriffs, and I not preſent! <hi>Whereunto Sir</hi> J. L. <hi>anſwer'd,</hi> Whoever told
your Lordſhip ſo, miſinform'd your Lordſhip; we came very peaceably to the Hall to
perform our duty, and know well what it is to adminiſter an Oath, and had not the
leaſt intention of ſuch a thing, but to lay our claim by preſenting Sheriffs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir</hi> R. C. <hi>alſo told his Lordſhip,</hi> he ought to be angry with thoſe that had given
him falſe Information, rather than with thoſe he was miſinformed of; and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was intended or deſigned contrary to his Lordſhips frequent and publick De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
which was, that the matter ſhould be determin'd by Law; and it was adviſed
that could not be done, unleſs Mr. <hi>Papillon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dubois</hi> did preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be ſworn.</p>
            <p>Whereupon his Lordſhip ſeemed to reſt ſatisfied; and immediately the reſt
of the Aldermen with the other Sheriffs coming in, Mr. <hi>Papillon and</hi> Mr.
<hi>Dubois</hi> preſented themſelves to his Lordſhip, and Mr. <hi>Papillon</hi> read a Paper
the contents whereof were as followes.</p>
