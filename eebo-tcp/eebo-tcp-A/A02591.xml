         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ſuch as flow from ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:3929:3"/>
Iuſtice, Diuine and humane;
there is a double peace, outward
in the ſtate, inward in the ſoule:
Accordingly, there is a double
ſenſe of my Text; a ſpirituall, a
ciuill ſenſe: The ſpirituall concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Theologicall Iuſtice, and
inward peace; The ciuill concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
humane Iuſtice and outward
peace. The ſpirituall thus; The
Meſſias ſhall cauſe the fruit of his
perfect iuſtice to be our inward
peace with God, and our ſelues.
The ciuill thus; The Magiſtrate
ſhall cauſe the worke of ciuill Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
in his adminiſtration, to be
our outward peace with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
In both, or either (as <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus</hi>
well) there is an alluſion in
the Hebrew word to a field; the
ſoile is the heart or the State, the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3929:3"/>
ſeed is Iuſtice, the fruit peace: That
which was waſte ground is now a
Carmell, a fruitfull field; and the
fruit of this field of Iuſtice is peace.</p>
            <p>As there is good reaſon, we will
beginne with the ſpirituall <hi>Iuſtice</hi>
and <hi>Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The great King of Heauen will
disforeſt that peece of the world,
which he calls his Church, and put
it to tillage; it ſhall bee ſowne
with righteouſneſſe, and ſhal yeeld
a ſweet crop of peace: in this only,
not in the barren heaths of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
world ſhall true peace grow.</p>
            <p>At firſt, God and man were
good friends: How ſhould there
be other than good termes betwixt
Heauen and Paradiſe? God made
man iuſt; and iuſt man (whiles he
was ſo) could not chuſe but loue
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3929:4"/>
the iuſt God that made him; ſinne
ſet them at odds; in one act and
inſtant did man leeſe both his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
and peace; now the world is
changed; now the ſtile of God is
<hi>Fortis vltor,</hi>

There is no poſſible peace to bee
made betwixt God and man, but
by the perfect Iuſtice of him that
was both God and man: I would
there were a peace in the Church
about this Iuſtice; It is pitie and
ſhame there is not; but there muſt
be hereſies: As there are two parts
of Diuinity, the Law and the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell;
ſo each of theſe haue their
Iuſtice; there is a iuſtice of the
Law, and an Euangelicall Iuſtice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
The Iuſtice of the Law when a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3929:4"/>
meere morall man is iuſtified (out
of his owne powers) by the works
of the Law; very Papiſts will giue
ſo much way to <hi>S. Paul,</hi> ſo much
affront to <hi>Pelagius,</hi> as to renounce
this; freely anathematizing that
man who by the ſtrength of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature, or the doctrine of the
Law, ſhall challenge iuſtification;
Vnleſſe perhaps ſome <hi>Andradius</hi>

<hi>Ethica Iuſtitia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Morall righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> was enough to iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
and ſaue the old Philoſophers.</p>
            <p>The Euangelicall Iuſtice is not
without the interuention of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
To which claime is laid in
two kindes, either as imputatiue,
or as inherent; The inherent

diſtinctions into a large field of

No head in all Diuinity

Cardinall <hi>De Monte,</hi> Vice-Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
for the time of the Councell
of Trent, in an Oration made by

that when they meant to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
their Decree concerning Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification
in fifteene daies, it coſt
them ſeuen moneths to finiſh,
without one daies intermiſſion;
and when all is done, they haue
left the world, which was before
(as <hi>Pighius</hi> ingenuouſly) intrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the thorny queſtions of
Schoolemen, rather more vnſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied

Tribunall of God: What, but

or whoſe? Ours, or Chriſts?
Ours, in the inherent graces
wrought in vs, in the holy workes
wrought by vs; or Chriſts, in his
moſt perfect obedience, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious
ſatisfaction wrought for
vs, applied to vs. The Triden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
faction is for the former;
wee are for the latter; God is as
direct on our ſide as his Word
can make him; Euery where
blazoning the defects of our
owne righteouſneſſe, the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of our beſt Graces, the
deadly nature of our leaſt ſinnes;

ſweet comfort of that application,
the aſſurance and vnfailableneſſe
of that comfort: and laſtly, our
happy reſt in that aſſurance. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance

theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Satis aperti</hi> (ſaith their <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander</hi>)
The Scripture is cleare
ours, So is all antiquity, if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
that learned Arbiter; So are
their more ingenuous Doctors of
the laſt age; So would they all be,
if they had grace to know God,
themſelues, grace, ſinne, heauen,
hell; God perfectly iuſt, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
miſerably weake, Grace ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly

imperfect, ſinne vnmeaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
ſinfull; Laſtly, if they knew
that heauen is for none but the
pure, that hell is for the preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous.
O Sauiour, no man is iuſt
through thee, but he that is ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by thee; What is our inherent
juſtice, but ſanctity? That we aſpire
towards, we attaine not to; Woe
were vs if we were not more iuſt
in thee, than ſanctified in our
ſelues; we are ſanctified, in part,
according to the weakneſſe of our
receit; we are iuſtified thorowly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
according to the perfection of
thine acceptation; were we fully
ſanctified here, we ſhould be more
than men; were we not thorowly
iuſtified, wee ſhould be no more
than ſinners before thee; whiles
we ſtand before thee as ſinners, we
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:3929:7"/>
can haue no peace; Let others truſt
in the Charets and Horſes of their
owne ſtrength, we will remember
the Name of the Lord our God;
<hi>The worke of thy Iuſtice ſhall be our
peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Peace is a ſweet word; Euery
body would be glad of it; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
Peace at the laſt, as the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi>

Due ſatisfactions, vndue ſupere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogations,
patronages of Saints,

Hell, doubt of Heauen, aſſurance

Will the Lord be pleaſed with thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands

thou of giuing to the owner? The
world is his; thou art not thine
owne; Yea, were theſe things
thine, and not his, yet know, it is
not giuing, but taking that muſt
procure thy peace: An infinite Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice

intoxication, ſongs of ribaldry,
ſports of recreation; No, no, the

the further thou art from finding
it; and if theſe things may giue

In plaine termes; wouldſt thou
haue peace? None but Chriſt can
giue it thee; He will giue it to none
but the penitent, none but the
faithfull; Oh ſpend thy ſelfe into
the ſighes and teares of true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
and then raiſe thy humbled
ſoule to a liuely confidence in
thine all-ſufficient Redeemer; Set
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:3929:9"/>
thy Lord Ieſus betwixt God and
thy ſinnes; God cannot ſee thy
debt, but through thine acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
By his ſtripes we are healed,
by his wounds we are ſtanched,
by his death we are quickned, by
his righteouſneſſe we are diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged;
The worke of his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
is our peace. Oh ſafe and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
condition of beleeuers; Let
ſinne, Satan, world, death, hell,
doe their worſt;<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 33.</note> 
               <hi>Who ſhall lay any
thing to the charge of Gods elect;
It is God that iuſtifieth: who ſhall
condemne? It is Chriſt that died, yea
rather, that is riſen againe; who is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
at the right hand of God, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
interceſsion for vs:</hi> Our enemy
is now our Father, our Iudge is
our Sauiour, the offended our
ſurety, that precious bloud our
ranſome, that perfect righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:3929:10"/>
our euerlaſting peace.</p>
            <p>Thus much of our ſpirituall
Iuſtice, and Peace. The Ciuill fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes:
I know theſe two are
wide termes; Iuſtice compriſes
all vertue, as Peace all bleſſings;
For that is iuſt in all kinds, which
hath a meet adequation to the rule;
All vertue therefore conforming
vs to the law of God, which is the
rule of perfection, challengeth
iuſtly to it ſelfe a ſtile of juſtice.</p>
            <p>Narrower bounds will ſerue our
turne: We ſpeake of Iuſtice firſt as
a ſingle vertue. Habits are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
by their acts; acts by their
obiects. The obiect of all morall
vertue is good, as of all intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
is True. The obiect of this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of Iuſtice is the good of men in
relation to each other; Other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
order a man in regard to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3929:10"/>
Iuſtice, in regard to another.
This good being either common,
or priuate; common of all, priuate
of ſome; the acts and vertue of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
muſt bee ſutable; Either, as
man ſtands in an habitude to the
whole body; or as he ſtands to
ſpeciall limbs of the body: The
former of theſe is that which
Philoſophers and Caſuiſts call a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
and vniuerſall Iuſtice. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is that particular Iuſtice, which
we vſe to diſtinguiſh by <hi>Diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and <hi>Commutation;</hi> the one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
in matter of Commerce, the
other in Reward, or Puniſhment;
both of them according to a meet,
though different, equality: An
Arithmeticall equality in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation;
a Geometricall in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution;
the former regarding
the value, or worth of the thing,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3929:11"/>
the latter, regarding the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable
difference of the perſon.
The worke of all theſe three Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
is Peace.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the legall Iuſtice is the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
mother and nurſe of publique
Peace: When Gouernors and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
are carefull to giue each other
their owne; when both conſpire
to command and obey for the
common good; when men frame
their liues to the wholſome lawes
of their Soueraignes, not more out
of feare than conſcience; when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to the community caries men
from partiall reflections vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues;
As contrarily diſtractions,
and priuate ends are the bane of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſtate. When the head and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
vnite their thoughts and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuours
in the center of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
good: the head to deuiſe and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:3929:11"/>
command, the eies to ſee, the eare
to heare, the palate to taſte, the
heart to moue, the bellowes of the
lungs to blow, the liuer to ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,
the ſtomach to digeſt, the guts
to export, the hands to execute, the
tongue to talke for the good of
this naturall Common-wealth of
the body, all goes well and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
but if any of theſe parts will be
gathering to themſelues, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
grow within; and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous
diſtempers ariſe in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors,
ruine is threatned to the
whole: If either the Superiors miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>command,
or the inferiors diſobey,
it is an affront to Peace. I need not
tell you that good lawes are the
walls of the Citie, the ſinewes of
the politicke body, the rule of our
life, the life of our ſtate, without
which men would turne brute, yea
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:3929:12"/>
monſtrous; the world were a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os,
yea an hell. It is wiſdome that
makes lawes, it is Iuſtice that keeps
them; Oh let this Iuſtice ſtill bleſſe
vs with a perpetuall peace; as thoſe
that doe not thinke the world
made for vs, but our ſelues made
for the world, let vs driue at an
vniuerſall good; let there be euer
that ſweet correſpondence betwixt
Soueraignty and ſubiection, that
the one may be happy in the other,
both in peace.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the diſtributiue Iuſtice
is not leſſe fruitfull of peace; when
rewards of honors, &amp; gracious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
are ſuited to the well-deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing;
when malefactors ſmart ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their crimes; This Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
hath ſtocks for the vagrant,
whips for harlots, brands for petty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larzons,
ropes for fellons, weights
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:3929:12"/>
for the contumaciouſly ſilent,
ſtakes for blaſphemous hereticks,
gibbets for murtherers, the hurdle,
and the knife, and the pole for trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors;
and vpon all theſe engines of
Iuſtice hangs the garland of peace.
It was not for nothing that <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian</hi>
the firſt, paſſing by the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
ſaluted it with <hi>Salue Iuſtitia.</hi>
Ye neuer ſee Iuſtice painted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a ſword; when that ſword
glitters with vſe, it is well with the
publique, woe be to the Nation
where it ruſts. There can bee no
more acceptable ſacrifice than the
bloud of the flagitious. Immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after <hi>Garnets</hi> execution, <hi>Father
Dauid</hi> at <hi>Ypre;</hi> in a publike Sermon
declared the miracles ſhowne
thereat; Amongſt the reſt, that a
ſpring of oyle brake forth ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the place where that Saint
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:3929:13"/>
was martyred; Inſtead of a lie, let
it be a parable; The bloud of Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
ſhed by the ſword of Iuſtice,
is a well of oyle to fatten, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh
the Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>I know well how mercy befits
the mouths of Gods Miniſters:
The ſoft tongue of a Diuine is no
meet whetſtone for the edge of
ſeueritie; but withall, I dare ſay,
that Iuſtice is a noble worke of
mercy; neither need we wiſh to be
more charitable, than the God of
mercy that ſaies, <hi>Thine eie ſhall not
ſpare the murtherer,</hi> Numb. 35. 31.
<hi>The Tempter to idolatry,</hi> Deut. 13. 6.
The very ſonnes of <hi>Leui</hi> were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to win an euerlaſting bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
by conſecrating their hands
to God in Iſraelitiſh bloud: The
vniuſt fauour, and plauſibilitie of
Romiſh Doctors, towards capitall
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:3929:13"/>
offenders, hath made their Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries
(euen literally) a denne of
theeues, an harbour of villany. It
is memorable of <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>France,</hi>
(ſtiled the Saint) that he reuerſed a
pardon wrought from him to a
malefactor; vpon reading that verſe
in the <hi>Pſalme,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 106. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Beati qui faciunt iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiam
in omni tempore; Bleſſed are
they that doe iuſtice at all times:</hi> No
maruell if one of thoſe foure
things which <hi>Iſabell</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> was
wont to ſay, ſhe loued to ſee; were,
<hi>A Theefe vpon the ladder;</hi> Euen
through his halter might ſhe ſee
the proſpect of peace. Woe bee
to them that either for gaine or
priuate intereſt ingage themſelues
in the ſuit of fauour to maliciouſly
bloudy hands; that, by the dam of
their bribes labour to ſtop the due
courſe of punitiue Iuſtice; theſe,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:3929:14"/>
theſe are the enemies of peace;
theſe ſtaine the land with that
Crimſon die, that cannot be waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out but by many wofull lauers
of reuenge: Farre, farre be it from
any of you, generous Chriſtians,
to endeuour either to corrupt, or
interrupt the waies of iudgement,
or for a priuate benefit to croſſe the
publique peace: Woe be to thoſe
partiall Iudges, that iuſtifie the
wicked, and condemne the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent;
the girdle of whoſe equitie
ſaggs downe on that ſide where
the purſe hangs: Laſtly, woe to
thoſe vnworthy ones that raiſe
themſelues by fraud, bribes, ſymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
ſacrilege; therefore are theſe
enemies to the ſtate, becauſe to
peace; and therefore enemies to
peace, becauſe violaters of juſtice,
<hi>And the worke of Iuſtice is peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:3929:14"/>
Thirdly, that commutatiue Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
workes peace; needs no other
proofe than that all the reall brab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and ſuits amongſt men, ariſe
from either true or pretended iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
of contracts. Let me lead you
in a tearme morning to the ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Hall of Iuſtice: What is the
cauſe of all that concourſe? that
Hiue-like murmur? that noiſe at
the barre, but iniurious bargaines,
fraudulent conueyances, falſe ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,
diſappointment of truſts,
wrongfull detruſions of money,
goods, lands, couzenages, oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
extortions: Could the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty
and priuate Iuſtice of men
preuent theſe enormities, ſilence
and ſolitude would dwell in that
wide Palace of Iuſtice; neither
would there bee more Pleas than
Cob-webs vnder that vaſt roofe.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:3929:15"/>
Euery way therefore it is cleere,
that the worke of Iuſtice is peace;
In ſo much as the Guardians of
peace are called Iuſticers.</p>
            <p>This for the Common-wealth;
If it pleaſe you to caſt your eies
vpon her Siſter the Church, you
ſhall finde that the outward peace
thereof alſo muſt ariſe from Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.
Alas; thence is our hopeleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
Neuer may they proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
that loue not, that wiſh not
peace within thoſe ſacred walls;
but what poſſibility of peace in the
peremptory repulſes of Iuſtice?
What poſſibility of Iuſtice in the
long vſurped tyranny of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor
of <hi>Romulus?</hi> Could we hope
to ſee Iuſtice once ſhine from
thoſe ſeuen hills, we would make
account of peace; but, oh, the

            </p>
            <p>And as there is horrible iniuſtice
in theſe claimes; ſo is there no leſſe
in practiſe. Take a taſte for all:
What can be more vniuſt than to
caſt out of the lap of the Church
thoſe that oppoſe their nouelties,
to condemne them to the ſtake, to
hell for Heretikes. What more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt
than to falſifie the writings
of ancient, or moderne authors
by ſecret expurgations by wilfull
miſ-editions? what more vniuſt
than the with holding the remedy
of generall Councels, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting

Church by a pack't Conclaue?
What more vniuſt than the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion

of equiuocation; than

falſhood of rumors, than plotting
the ſubuerſion of King and ſtate
by vnnaturall conſpiracies? Well
may we call heauen and earth to
record againſt the iniuſtice of
theſe claimes, of theſe practiſes.
What then? Is it to hope for peace,
notwithſtanding the continuance
of all theſe? So the worke of Iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
ſhall be peace: And an vniuſt
and vnſound peace muſt it needs
be that ariſes from Iniuſtice; Is it
to hope they will abandon theſe
things for Peace? Oh that the

What haue wee attempted? what

            <p>That from them wee may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne

Bleſſed be God for Iuſtice: and if
in this common harmony of
Peace, there be found ſome priuate
iarres of diſcord, whence is it but
from our owne Iniuſtice? The
world is of another minde; whoſe

In the world, laſtly, Not the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
incrochers vpon others
dominions, not violaters of
leagues, not vſurpers of miſ-gotten
titles and dignities, not ſuborners,
or abettors of conſpiracies, and
traitors, but the vnkinde patients
that will not <hi>recipere ferrum:</hi>
I wis the great Potentates of the
world might ſee a ready way to
Peace.</p>
            <p>Thus in family, countrey, citie,
commonwealth, Church, world,
the greateſt part ſeeke a licentious
peace in a diſordered lawleſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
condemning true iuſtice of
cruelty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſtripping her of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of peace, branding her with
the cenſure of troubleſome. Foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
men ſpeake fooliſh things: Oh
noble and incomparable bleſſing
of peace, how iniuriouſly art thou
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:3929:21"/>
aſcribed to vniuſt neglect? Oh
diuine Vertue of Iuſtice, how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruedly
haue the Ancients giuen
thee wings, and ſent thee vp to
heauen in a deteſtation of theſe
earthly indignities; whence thou
comſt not downe at all, vnleſſe it
pleaſe that eſſentiall and infinite
Iuſtice to communicate thee to
ſome choyce fauourites. It is but
a iuſt word, that this Iland hath
beene long approued the darling
of heauen; We haue enioyed peace,
to the admiration, to the enuie of
neighbourhood: Would we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
it? would we traduce it to
ours? Iuſtice muſt doe it for vs.
Both Iuſtice, and Peace, are from
the throne; Peace is the Kings
Peace; and Iuſtice deſcends from
Soueraignty by commiſſion; Let
me haue leaue to ſay with the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:3929:21"/>
princely Prophet (a word that was
too good for the frequent text of
a Pope) <hi>Diligite iuſtitiam qui iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatis
terram.</hi> Still, ô God, giue
thy iudgements to the King, and
thy Iuſtice to the Kings ſonne.
And if any ſhall offer wrong to
the Lords anointed in his perſon,
in his ſeed, the worke of that iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
ſhall be war; yea <hi>Bellum Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi>
the Lords war, (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 28)
Then let him who is both the
Lord of Hoſts, and the God of
peace, riſe vp mightily for his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed,
the true King of Peace;
that he who hath graciouſly ſaid
all this while, <hi>Da pacem, Domine,
Giue peace in our time, O Lord,</hi>
may ſuperſcribe at the laſt his iuſt
Trophees, with, <hi>Bleſſed bee the
Lord which teacheth my hands to
warre, and my fingers to fight.</hi>

Ye haue heard of the ſpirituall
Iuſtice and Peace; Yee haue heard
of the Ciuill; may it pleaſe you
to mix both of them together:
My text alone doth it; if you doe
but with our moſt accurate
Tranſlation, reade Righteouſneſſe
for Iuſtice; So ſhall you ſee the
ſpirituall diſpoſition of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
produce the ciuill effect of
Peace, What is Righteouſneſſe, but
the ſincere vprightnes of the heart
to God in all our waies: He is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
with God, that would be ſo:</p>
            <p>What need I tell you that this
is the way to true inward peace,
<hi>Nil conſcire,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Not to bee guilty of ill.</note> A cleare heart will be
a quiet one. There is no feaſt to a

<hi>That the honeſteſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionableſt

He may perhaps be plaine, perhaps
poore, perhaps weake, but the ſtate

I ſay from better authoritie,
that a lewd man can no more be a

can bee a good man: Heare this

can ye be loyall, whiles you lodge
traytors in your boſomes? Proteſt
what ye will; your ſins breake the
peace, and conſpire againſt the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Crowne, and dignitie of your
Soueraigne; What care wee that
you draw your ſword, and
vow your bloud, and drinke

your healths to your Gouernours,
when in the meane while you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke

            <p>That I may winde vp this clew;
It were folly to commend to you
the worth of peace; we know that
the excellency of Princes is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by <hi>ſerenity;</hi> what good hath
the earth which God doth not

Bleſſed be God, and his Anointed,

euery way; Firſt, let God haue
his owne; His owne daies, his
owne ſeruices; his feare, his loue,
his all: Let Religion leade all our
proiects, not follow them; let our
liues be led in a conſcionable obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to all the lawes of our
maker: Far bee all blaſphemies,

from our hearts. Let our hearts,

Then, for men: let vs giue <hi>Caeſar</hi>
