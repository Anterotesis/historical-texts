            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the frindly Reader Vlpian Fullwell wisheth health.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE wyse &amp; sage Philosopher <hi>Solon,</hi> noting the insolencie of <hi>Cressus,</hi> who esteemed him self the happiest man ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, because of his abundant welth, tolde him, that no man is to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted happie during his lyfe tyme, because he kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth not whether it shall ende with renowne or infamie. Concluding hereby, that a goodly lyfe, &amp; a godly death maketh a perfect happie man.</p>
            <p>Nowe, seing our late soueraigne Lorde Kynge <hi>Henrye</hi> the eyghth, hath hit the marke of trewe felicitie, and wonne the game of ioyfull immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie: what ruthe were it, that so singuler an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample shoulde not be recorded in the golden booke of perpetuall Fame. His noble lyfe, his Godly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedinges, his inuicted raygne, his fortunate suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, his whole race of lyfe, and ende of the same, deserueth to be engraued in letters of pure Golde. If <hi>Alexander</hi> (the myghtie Monarche of <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don)</hi> was offended with a Schoolemaster in whose Schoole he founde not the fame of <hi>Vlisses</hi> (written by <hi>Homer)</hi> howe much more maye wee deeme he woulde checke and reproue all Englyshe Gentlemen, that laye not before their faces the
<pb facs="tcp:2905:5"/>
booke of King <hi>Henryes</hi> lyfe, if he were nowe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vs. But happely it will be sayd vnto mee, Sir, if you weare as good an Englyshe Poet as <hi>Homer</hi> was in Greeke: or if the worthinesse of your style were comparable to the matter, wee would the better esteeme of your woorke. If that bee thy obiection (gentle Reader) I cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse my selfe. For I confesse I haue not the gifte of flowing eloquence, neyther can I enterlace my phrase with Italian termes, nor powder my style with frenche Englishe or Inkhorne Rhethoricke, neyther cowche my matter vnder a cloake of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious inuentions, to feede the daintie eares of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate yonkers. And as I cannot: So if I could, I woulde not. For I see that manye men are so affected with these premisses, that manye good matters are obscured, the Aucthors encombred, the woorkes but meanely commended, and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der deceaued. For while he coueteth to come to the purpose, he is lead amasked in the wylde Desert of circumstance and digression, seeking farre and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding little, feeding his humor on pleasant woordes of slender wayght, guyded (or rather giddyed) with plaucible eloquence.</p>
            <p>I do not herein condempne, neither discomende the noble Science of Rhethorike, nor the eloquent Rhethoritian, but rather wishe that excellent skill to be employed onlye on such matters as may both commende the speaker, and the thing spoken, or the writer and the thing written: hauing alwayes
<pb facs="tcp:2905:5"/>
the cheefe respect to tyme &amp; place. For as it would sounde verye absurde to the eares of the skilfull Musitian to heare a gallyard, or any other daunce playde on the solemne Organs: So no lesse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie is it, to daunce after an Hymn or other cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning voluntarie. Thus (gentle Reader) I desyre at thy handes, that thou accept the matter, &amp; beare w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> my crabbed meeter. Considering well that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten tymes is founde good graffes vppon a Crab tree stocke. Take then the fruite, and accepte my good will. And if thou list bestowe anye fyling vpon the roughnes of my phrase, I shall bee beholding vnto thee. If not, yet shall my desyre be satisfied with thy good worde.</p>

In so much that the Iewes were in good hope that one of these noble Champions should be ordeined of God to be their <hi>Messias,</hi> whose comming they haue long in vayne expected, refusing the trewe <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias</hi> and sauiour of the worlde <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for a Champion to bring them home again vnto their destroyed Ierusalem.</p>

more, mentioned by <hi>Paulus Iouius</hi> &amp; other good Aucthors. And among them all, the same of king <hi>Henry</hi> shyned farre brighter then the rest, as hereafter followeth. But first I will note of the blisse and happines that came vnto Englande by his byrth. It is manifest that he was the first braunche of the tree of concorde, after the any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the two noble howses of <hi>Laucaster</hi> and <hi>Yorke,</hi> that long had beene at discention &amp; open hostilitie for the imperiall Diadem of this realme. For although his brother Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> were the elder, yet because he liued not to enioy his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers seignories, neyther left behynde him anye Issue: I recken him that brought forth the fruite to be the cheefe and principall braunche. He was also elect and chosen of God to be that <hi>Ezechias</hi> that should sinsearly set forth his sacred lawes. Yea he was the verye <hi>Hercules</hi> that was borne to subdue the Romysh <hi>Hydra,</hi> against whyche many hedded monster, neyther kyng nor Keysar could preuayle, vntill this puissant <hi>Hercules</hi> tooke the matter in hand, to the glorie of God, and his perpetuall fame. He was also endewed by God with inuincible Fortitude, alwayes preuaylyng with glorious victorie. And lyke as when <hi>moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 17.</note> helde vp his Rodde the <hi>Israelites</hi> had the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hande, and while he helde downe the same their enemies had hope of victorie. So likewyse on whose syde so euer <hi>king Henry</hi> helde vp his Sworde, that parte had alwaye prosperous suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse.
<pb facs="tcp:2905:10"/>
As the warres betweene the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, and <hi>Frauncis</hi> the French kyng may sufficiently shewe. More ouer the lyke bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of God happened vnto him, as seeldome, or (rather I thinke) neuer chaunced vnto any kyng. For where as hee hauing three chyldren and no mo, at his departure out of this worlde: they haue all three succeeded the father. Not as priuate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, but successiuely in the regall seate: Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his landes and territories. Also his noble magnanimitie was such, that he being Lorde of <hi>Ireland,</hi> was by the Erles, Lordes &amp; Piers of the same Realme, desyred to take vpon him the name of their king. And they of their owne accordes, (in the name of the whole Realm of <hi>Ireland)</hi> did vnto him Homage and Fealtie.</p>
               <p>Besides all this, when <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror was dead, the Princes Electors of the Empire of <hi>Rome,</hi> with generall consent, committed their full aucthoritie of Eleccion, for the space of foure daies vnto kyng <hi>Henry,</hi> eyther to take the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire him selfe, or els to nominate whom he would, who thankfully accepted their good willes, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring vnto them againe their aucthoritie, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing to be Emperor him selfe. Thus we may saye (and that trewely) that he wan a kingdome without battaile or bludshed. And he was of power, not onely to be an Emperor, but also to make an Emperor. And thus I may boldly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuer, that he was blest of God aboue all kynges
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2905:10"/>
and Princes that euer I haue read of. And happy was that Prince that might stande moste in his fauour. For the which dyuers made great suite, &amp; specially when they stoode in neede of ayd against their enemies, because they perceiued that <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi> followed his power, as handmayd to all his proceedings. A rare example (no doubt) it is, &amp; me seemeth most strange, that one king should raigne 38. yeres, and that (almost) in continuall warres, and neuer take foyle, but alwaies preuailed as a victor inuicted, which without the assistaunce of almyghtie God, he could neuer haue atchyued.</p>
               <p>An euident token that God was on his syde, and therefore who coulde stande agaynst him.</p>
               <p>But to write at large of his worthinesse and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable actes, would fill a bigg volume, and were too great a charge for my vnskilfull penne.</p>
               <p>Finally, he was a Prince of singuler Prudence, of passing stoute courage, of inuincible Fortitude, of dexteritie wonderfull. He was a springing well of Eloquence, a rare spectacle of Humanitie. Of ciuilitie or good nurture, an absolute president.</p>
               <p>A speciall paterne of Clemencie and moderation, a worthie example of Regall Iustice. A bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse spring of larges and benignitie. He was in all the honest Artes and Faculties profoundlye seene. In all liberall disciplines, equall with the best. In no kynde of literature, vnexperte. Hee was to the worlde an ornament. To Englande a treasure. To his frendes, a comforte. To hys foes, a terror.</p>

To his saythfull and louing Subiectes, a tender Father. To Innocents, a sure Protectour. To wilfull malefactours, a sharpe scourge. To his Common weale and good people, a quyet Hauen and Aucor of safegarde. To the disturbers of the same, a Rocke of Extermination. In haynous and intollerable crymes against the comon welth, a seuear Iudge. In the lyke offences committed against him selfe, a redye porte and refuge of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye, except to such as would persist incorrigiblye. A man he was in all gifts of nature, of Fortune, and of grace, pierles. And to conclude, a man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all prayses.

               <p>The king at this tyme to solace him self, rode to <hi>Lisley</hi> (which is a town of the Emperours) where as he was nobly entertained. And at his entrie in to the towne, the keyes of the gates were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vnto him to dispose at his pleasure: who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued them thankfully, rendring them againe to him of whome he tooke them.

                  <note place="margin">Turney.</note> who ryght ioyousely came thither, and were there royally feasted, and his trayne had both greate entertainment and bountifull rewardes.</p>
               <p>In these warres were manye feates of Armes tryed, and sundry noble exploites atchyued, and in conclusion, the cheefe power of Fraunce discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited. But among the tragicall euents that there happened, one pretie accident chaunced by master <hi>Henry Norace,</hi> who at that tyme being a yong <note place="margin">Henry Norace.</note> Gentleman, and one of the kinges Henchemen, hauing on his head the kinges Helmet: was by the fiercenesse of his horse caryed from the kings Campe into the middest of the Frenche armye that then lay without the towne of <hi>Turnay</hi> in battaile ray. And being thus among his enemies against his will: at laste founde the meanes to turne his horse hed againe, and so by good happe came backe vnto the king: wherof the king was ryght glad. And being thus escaped, the king of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to make him knight for this aduenture. But he tolde the king, that his horse rather deserued
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:2905:27"/>
that dignitie, which caryed him among his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies against his will. Whereat the king plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly laughed, for he loued this yong gentleman verie well.</p>
               <p>And because my Aucthor was brought vp vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this saide Gentleman, and by him preferred vnto the king, I am occasioned somewhat to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse by remembraunce of his worthinesse. This forenamed master <hi>Norace</hi> grewe in suche fauour and grace with the king, that he became to be the chiefe gentleman of his priuie Chamber, and also was master of the blacke Rodd: Which is an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to the noble Order of the Garter, which office hath a large Prerogatiue. He was rightfullye termed the father of the Court (nexte vnder the king) for his singuler order of education in courtly ciuilitie: As dyuers noble men, and gentlemen, by him brought vp, can full well witnesse. Namely The Lorde <hi>Henry Dudley,</hi> the Lord <hi>Sheafield,</hi> The Lorde <hi>Edmund Shandos,</hi> with many more. His nature was to do good to as manye as hee might, and harme to none. His pursse was neuer shut from the needie. Finally, he was endued w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all godly and vertuous condicions: liuing in the courte in great fauour and estimation, vntill enuye (who alwaies pursueth vertue) threw at him her spytefull and poysoned dartes, to his decaye. After whose death, the king (to shewe his good will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes him) shewed him selfe gracious Lord vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to as manye as were seruauntes vnto the sayde
<pb facs="tcp:2905:28"/>
master <hi>Norace</hi> in his lyfe tyme, and to expresse the same more at large: he bestowed his daughter (mistresse <hi>Marie Norace)</hi> in Mariage on Sir <hi>George Carew,</hi> which mariage was solempnised in the Court, at the proper costes and charges of the king, to the same and furtherance of the saide knight and the yong ladye his wife.</p>
               <p>Now to returne to my matter againe. Whyle the king was in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> king <hi>lames</hi> of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande <note place="margin">An. Do. 1513.</note> (notwithstanding his league and solempne vowe before mencioned) made an inuasion vppon the Borderers adioyning vnto Scotlande. And sent an Ambassadour vnto the kyng into Fraunce, accusing the Borderers for breache of the truce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them taken. When the king vnderstoode by the Ambassadour, of the king of Scottes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence: He rewarded the Ambassadour, and so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed him.</p>
               <p>Nowe the king of Scottes supposed that all the power of Englande was in Fraunce with king <hi>Henry:</hi> knowing also that king <hi>Henry</hi> could not, nor woulde not breake vp his Campe to come against him, And thought that nowe he had a plaine gappe opened vnto him, to enter into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande, and there to woorke his will. But by the prouidence of the Queene, who was left Regent of the Realme by the king at his setting foorth, &amp; by the balyanties of the Earle of Surrey the kinges lieftenaunt, he was preuented of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. For when he thought to haue entered this
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:2905:28"/>
Realme with all his power, he was mett by the Earle of Surrey at a place called <hi>Brampston,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">This field was it that we call flod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fielde,</note> where betweene them was fought a cruell bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle not without great effusion of blood on both parties: but in the ende (by Gods prouidence) the victorie fell vnto the englishe men. The King of Scottes himselfe being slayne in this fielde with xi. of his noble men being all of them Earles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sydes a number of his knyghtes and gentilmen of name, and his whole power made very weake. This battaile being ended to the renoune of the Queene, the Earle the kinges lieuetenant, and the whole Realme: The dead bodye of the king of Scottes was founde among the other carcases in the fielde, and from thence brought to <hi>London,</hi> and so through <hi>London</hi> streetes on a horsebacke, in such order as you haue reade before of king <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charde,</hi> and from thence it was caried to <hi>Sheene</hi> (neere vnto <hi>Brainford)</hi> wheras the Queene then laye. And theare this periured carcas lyeth vnto this daye vnburied. A condigne ende and a meete Sepulker for such a forsworn Prince. This shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ende of the Scottish king, kindled the Fyer of malyce in the breastes of the Scottes, the flame whereof (in the ende) consumed also their yong king that then was lefte vnto them, as followinge you may reade.

               <p>This yong king of Scottes, was both Neuew and Godson vnto king <hi>Henry,</hi> by meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the king was lothe to do anye annoyance vnto the Realme of <hi>Scotlande.</hi> But the Scottes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greedie of reuenge for the death of their late king, prouoked him to be doing with them, by meanes wherof, many incursions were made into <hi>Scotlande,</hi> to the great detriment of the Scottes and destruction of many of their Castels and vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages. <note place="margin">An. do. 1523.</note> But at the laste, by the mediation of the Queene of Scottes, an abstinence of warre was taken, and shortly after a peace concluded, whiche continued vntil the yere of our Lorde 1542. at whiche tyme king <hi>Henry</hi> tooke his Progres to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the Citie of <hi>Yorke,</hi> where he made great preparation for to haue mett with his Nephewe the king of Scottes, who promysed vnto his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle king <hi>Henry,</hi> that he would verye gladly meete him at <hi>Yorke,</hi> and accordingly prepared so to doo. Wherefore king <hi>Henry</hi> laye at <hi>Pipwell</hi> Abbey
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:2905:31"/>
while great prouision was made at <hi>Yorke,</hi> for the meeting of these two noble kinges, to the greate charges of the king of <hi>Englande,</hi> at whose pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per costes, a sumptuous lodging was ordayned for the king of Scottes in the Abbay of <hi>Yorke,</hi> with offices and furniture accordingly.</p>
               <p>Whyle the king laye at <hi>Pipwell</hi> Abbay aforesaid in a readynesse to come vnto <hi>yorke</hi> by the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed: the Secretorie vnto the king of Scottes came vnto king <hi>Henry,</hi> who was at his handes noblye entertayned, and returned againe into Scotlande, enforming the king his maister, what great cost the king of Englande was at, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for his cumming. The king of Scottes was as desyrous to see his Uncle king <hi>Henry,</hi> as he was to haue seene his Nephew. But when he was in a readinesse to come towardes Englande, the Cardinall of S. <hi>Andrewes,</hi> who was then newely come from <hi>Rome,</hi> made haite vnto the king of Scottes (as he was setting forth toward <hi>Yorke)</hi> and threatned him, that if he proceeded to go into Englande, that another shoulde bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed king of Scotlande before he shoulde bee iii. Myles out of his Realme. Wherat the kyng was sore abashed, and not without good cause: For a kingdome deuyded in it selfe, cannot be qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted without great trouble and bloodshed. And the saide Cardinall bare so great a swaye that the king durst not come into Englande according to his appointment. It is thought that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cardinal
<pb facs="tcp:2905:32"/>
feared lest the king of <hi>Englande</hi> would haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded the kinge of Scottes to abolyshe the Popes aucthoritie out of <hi>Scotlande,</hi> and to alter the state of Religion, and therefore was not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that this meeting shoulde be betweene the two kinges. King <hi>Henry</hi> perceiuing him selfe to be thus deluded by the king of Scottes, concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued therof great discurtesie (as he myght ful well) Notwithstanding he went forwarde him selfe with all his trayne to <hi>yorke,</hi> and made Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that if any man had any matters to exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite vnto his grace, that they shoulde be heard, and haue Iustice administred, which accordingly hee accomplished to as many as came before him.</p>
               <p>And whereas there had bene an insurrection in the same countrey a little before this tyme: The king comaunded that all the Rebelles which were apprehended shoulde be placed before him on the lefte hande of his waye as he passed thorough the countrey, and hauing set the countrey in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, he returned to <hi>London</hi> againe.</p>
               <p>The Cardinall of sainct Androes, who (as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore saide) caused the king of Scottes to breake promise with his vncle king <hi>Henry</hi> (for doubt least that discourtesie might be reconsiled) to make hys matter sure: set the two kinges at open warre, and caused the Scottes to make a roade into the borders, who spoyled and did much harme. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of when king <hi>Henry</hi> hearde, he sent the Duke of <hi>Norffolke</hi> with an Armie into Scotlande, who
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:2905:32"/>
burned and spoyled muche of the countrey. But when the Duke was departed from thence into <hi>Englande:</hi> The Scottes inuaded the borders againe, &amp; did theare muche harme. But at the last Sir <hi>Thomas Wharton</hi> (beeing warden of the marches there) with Sir <hi>William Musgraue</hi> and a fewe of the borderers, met with the Scottes the 14. of Nouember, and ouerthrew them: In which conflict the Lorde <hi>Maxwell,</hi> the Earles of <hi>Glen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carue</hi> and <hi>Sassiles,</hi> with all the captaynes of the Scottish Armie were taken: and on S. <hi>Thomas</hi> eeuen the Apostle, they were brought to the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> where they laye that night. The next day following they were brought into the starre Chamber before the Lorde Chaunceller of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and the Counsaile, being by the kinges char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges rychely apparailed, and vsed more like Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces then prisoners, which they did full euil requite. For after they were dismissed vppon agreement <note place="margin">Unthankfull Scottes.</note> vnto certein articles, they not only refused the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of their promises, but (notwithstanding the benefites on them bestowed by the king) they rebelled against him.</p>
               <p>But nowe to returne againe vnto their kinge: It is thought of some men, that he him selfe was in the Battaile, and thear receiued his deathes wounde, but escaped vntaken, but it was not so. <note place="margin">This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicte was at a place called Solomosse.</note> True it is, that this conflict stroke him to the hart, wherof he dyed incontinently. Whereby we may bee sure that God strooke the stroake. And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:2905:33"/>
it were, that God (who stryketh to the thirde and fourth generation of them that hate him) did it for his fathers offence, or for his owne, I maye not, nor will not iudge. But no doubt his fathers vngodly periurie was heauily in his mynde: since whose death the Realme of Scotlande hath bene sore plaged, and haue had little good successe in any attemptes, and especially against Englande.</p>
               <p>The tirste that brought newes of the kinge of Stottes death vnto king <hi>Henry,</hi> was the Earle of <hi>Angoes</hi> a Scott, who was banished out of Scotlande, and lyued here in Englande by a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion that the king gaue vnto him. This Earle came into the Courie (the king then lying at hys house of <hi>Sainct Iames)</hi> betweene tenne and xi. of the clocke at nyght, and desyred to speak with the king, which being vnto him admitted: he rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vnto the king the whole circumstance of the king of Scottes death. Whiche when he hearde, he was so sorie of that newes (that notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he warred against him) yet he let fall teares from his eyes for sorrowe of his Nephewes death.</p>

               <p>ALthough there was bluddie warre and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall hatred betweene the realmes of Englande and Fraunce, in the fifth yere of this kings raigne: in whiche yere, the king of Englande wan from the Frenche men the towne of <hi>Turwin</hi> and the great citie of <hi>Turnay</hi> as is before declared, yet for the concluding of a perfect peace betweene bothe the Realmes, the same yere a Mariage was made betweene the king of Fraunce and the Ladye <hi>Marye</hi> (sister vnto the king of England) but short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the saide king of Fraunce dyed, and the Duke of <hi>Suffolke</hi> maryed the Queene his wyfe. A peace also was concluded betweene the young king of Fraunce and the king of Englande. And within a whyle the Citie of <hi>Turnay</hi> was rendred vnto the Frenche king: For the whiche he shoulde paye to the king of Englande a notable summe of Money. But this amitie did not long continue: for the Frenche king refused to paye his tribute to the king of England, and also detayned the Queenes dowrie. And moreouer, caused all Englishemens goodes to bee arrested at <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> whereupon the Frenchemens goods were arrested at <hi>London</hi> and they cast in Prison. But in fine in the xix. yere
<pb facs="tcp:2905:37"/>
of the king his raigne, a generall peace was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claymed betwene the kinges of Englande and Fraunce during bothe their lyues. And defyaunce sent vnto the Emperour from bothe the kyngs, and a great power sent into <hi>Italy</hi> againste the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour (who then warred with the Pope and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stayned him to take a Castell, wherein he remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as prisoner, vntill the Armyes that the kinges of Englande and Fraunce had expelled the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours power out of that parte of <hi>Italye.</hi> The circumstance whereof ys very largely declared by <hi>Sleydon.)</hi> This peace taken betweene the kinges of Englande and Fraunce, continued a good whyle vnuiolate. In whiche meane-tyme, the Ambassadour <hi>Ledger</hi> of Fraunce (that then laye in <hi>London)</hi> grewe in suche fauour with kynge <hi>Henry,</hi> that he was often tymes admitted to sit in presence with the king. This Ambassadour made humblesuite vnto the kinges grace, that hee woulde vouchesaue to meete with the kynge of Fraunce his Master in some conuenient place, to salute eche other, declaring that it woulde bee an occasion to knitt them togeather in the insoluble knott of perfect frindship and amitie. Whereunto the king of Englande willingly condiscended and agreed. And the rather because the Frenche king appointed to haue met with the Pope at <hi>Marsiles</hi> by meanes wherof, king <hi>Henry</hi> hoped that the Frenche king might perswade the Pope to some conformitie in the controuersie of his deuorce from
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:2905:37"/>
the Ladye <hi>Katherin,</hi> wherefore he requested the sayde Ambassadour so to informe the kynge of Fraunce (his Master) which he nothing slacked to do. And in conclusion, a tyme was appointed when these twoo noble kinges shoulde meete by a place called <hi>Morguison</hi> whiche is betweene two greate hilles, and the midway betwixt <hi>Callice</hi> &amp; <hi>Boloigne.</hi> According to the apointment, the king of Englande set forwarde and came to <hi>Callice.</hi> The Frenche king lykewise lay at <hi>Bolloigne,</hi> and on the appointed day, they bothe met by the sayde place called <hi>Morguison</hi> with a noble trayne of Dukes, Earles, Lordes, Knightes &amp; Gentlemen on both sydes. And while these noble Princes em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced eache other, a Bishop of Fraunce threwe off a cast of great Hawkes called Sakers, which Hawkes being cast off, killed a Kyte ouer the kinges heades, to the great pleasure of bothe the kinges. Then passed they forwarde with Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pastymes vnto the towne of <hi>Boloigne,</hi> where was greate preparation and noble tryumphes to entertaine and welcome the King of Englande. When king <hi>Henry</hi> had passed certaine dayes at <hi>Boloigne</hi> with moste royall solace and pleasure, he Inuited the King of Fraunce to the lyke at his graces towne of <hi>Callice,</hi> who in lyke maner came vnto <hi>Callice</hi> with king <hi>Henry,</hi> where as his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer entertainment vnto the king of Englande &amp; his trayne, was noblye acquyted. And whyle these two royall Kinges were thus at <hi>Callice,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:2905:38"/>
the king of Heraldes came vnto king <hi>Henries</hi> grace, declaring vnto him that (according to the auncient custome, and also being parcell of hys othe) he had set vp in the market place the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Armes, and the Frenche kinges Armes (for so is the custome, when kings meete together) and desyred his grace to enforme him what might please him to bee erected in his behalfe, to whom the King aunswered, that nothing shoulde bee set vp for him, neyther I care not (quod he) for anye suche matter. Then sayde the Heralde, it is my duitie to erecte somewhat in your graces name.

spread that hee was determined to goe ouer vnto <hi>Parys.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> lay (by the kinges apointment) at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> siege of <hi>Muttrell,</hi> who hearing of the kinges pryuie passage into Fraunce, maruailed with him selfe what shoulde bee hys pretence: And thought some vncurtesie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might not haue been made pryuy therof, he being one of the kings pryuy counsail.

mortall man in this worlde doth knowe the cause hereof, but onelye Sir <hi>Charles Brandon:</hi> And thou shalt bee the second, vnto whome I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale this matter.

Now was the Duke of <hi>Suffolke</hi> before <hi>Bullaine,</hi> and had layde siege vnto it on the Easte syde ofit, who thear remayned vntill the king him selfe came and encamped on the North side.

Whiche the king mercifully graunted on this condicion, that none of them should departe with any Gonne charged. And the Bulleiners departed the town with as much of theyr goodes as they could cary with them. After which departure, king <hi>Henrie</hi> with hys nobilitie entred the towne with Banners displayed lyke a conquerour. And after hee had taried there by the

But when the kings maiestie was vppon departure, newes was brought vnto him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the <hi>Dolphin</hi> of Fraunce was determined to come downe and repell him from thence and hys power, whereunto the king aunswered that hee shoulde be verie welcome. For (quoth he) the <hi>Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin</hi> is my God sonne: and if he come, he shall haue my blessing. But he made no haste to come, as he vaunted? Wherefore the Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> perswaded the king to returne home to Englande againe, for that he had wonne as much honour theare, as was to be had at that tyme. Wherupon the king committed the defence of the towne to the Duke of <hi>Suffolke</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> ioyntly. But before his departure, he being doubtfull whether the Duke of <hi>Norfolke</hi> had any neede of help at <hi>Muttrell,</hi> called vnto him syr <hi>Anthony Browne,</hi> &amp; appointed him to go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the ayde of the Duke of <hi>Norfolke</hi> with all his power. But Sir <hi>Anthony Browne</hi> answered that he had dismissed many of his souldiers by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of sicknesse, &amp; the rest were either wounded or wearied with trauaile, and many of their Horses tyred. Then the king demaunded of the Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> In what estate his bande was: who had <note place="margin">This earle is he that was after Lords marques of Northapton.</note> vnder his charge 1500 horsemen, he aunswered the kyng, that of his whole power he wanted not

60. And that hee was ready to fulfill his graces pleasure. Wherupon the king thought to haue sent him to <hi>Muttrell,</hi> but in the end y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> king hauing a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall regarde for the keeping of <hi>Bullaine,</hi> leatte the Earle with the Duke to defende the towne, and sent Sir <hi>Ihon Gage</hi> to <hi>Muttrell</hi> to the ayde of the Duke of <hi>Norfolk.</hi> And then the king returned into England againe with great triumph. After whose departure out of Fraunce, y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> frenchmen began to be verye busie against the englishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>. But when they could preuaile nothing at all, they began to entreat for peace, always hoping to haue <hi>Bullayne</hi> againe by some meanes or other. But king <hi>Henry</hi> was so affected to that towne, that neyther strengthe of warre, nor force of money could win it from hym.

            <head>Â¶ THE HISTORY OF the winning of Hadington <hi>in Scotlande.</hi> An. 2. Reg. Edwardi. 6.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I had ended this treatise of the moste famous king <hi>Henry</hi> the eyght, and readie to put the same in prynte: I chaunced into the company of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Capitaines that had serued in king <hi>Henries</hi> warres, &amp; in king <hi>Edwardes,</hi> and euersince, as often as they haue bene called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. And after talke ministred: They seemed greatly to lament, that so noble a piece of seruyce as was done at <hi>Hadington,</hi> shoulde so sleyghtlye passe thorough the handes of Cronographers. Whereupon I (being by them earnestly reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted) haue taken on mee to discourse therof, by the instruccions of these sayde Gentlemen, who were theare present during all this worthie seruice, which well deserueth the name of noble and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie. In so muche that the Frenchemen (that then were there to the ayde of the Scottes) saye vnto this daye, that there are fewe good Soldiers in Englande (except those that were at this siege of <hi>Hadington)</hi> preferring the seruice that was then <note place="margin">1548</note> thear, before any other that euer they knewe or hearde of. The maner whereof ensueth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:2905:56"/>
The Lorde <hi>Graye</hi> being at <hi>Barwike</hi> &amp; the kings liefetenaunt theare: After the ouerthrowe of the Scottes at <hi>Muscleborow</hi> fielde, made a roade into Scotlande in the Lent, in the seconde yere of the kinges Raigne, to take a viewe of the towne of <hi>Hadington,</hi> and returned to <hi>Barwike</hi> agayne without any assault geeuen. The Sommer fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing he came with his armye and entred the towne without anye resistaunce, and then made preparation for the fortifying therof. In whyche meane space, he laide siege vnto a Castell that was three myles from the towne named <hi>Ester Castell,</hi> which Forte was furnished with Scottes and Spanyardes, who stoode at their defence, refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to submitt them selues, vntill the Lord <hi>Graye</hi> had with the great Cannons made a breach, and was readie to enter the saide Castell. Then they yelded and desyred Pardon for their lyues onely, which the lorde <hi>Gray</hi> graunted vnto them all, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting one: who (during the siege) had reuyled the King in woordes, and abused his graces name with moste opproprious termes. Then they all came forth of the castell in their thurtes onely, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them selues to the mercye of the Lorde <hi>Gray.</hi> And vpon strayt examination, who should be the tayler that was excepted out of this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don: it was knowne to be one <hi>Newton</hi> a Scott. But he, to saue him selfe, put it to one <hi>Hamelton.</hi> Thus these two Gentlemen accused one the other. For the decysing wherof, a Cumbat was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:2905:56"/>
betweene them, and by the Lorde <hi>Gray</hi> ad iudped so to bee.</p>
            <p>The tyme came for this Cumbat to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyshed, <note place="margin">A Cumbat.</note> and the listes made in the Market place of <hi>Hadington.</hi> And these saide gentlemen entred in their dubblets and hose, weaponed with sword, buckler and dagger. At the firste entrie into the listes, this <hi>Hammelton</hi> kneeled on his knees, and made his hartie prayer vnto Almyghtie God, to geeue the victorie vnto the truthe: with solempne protestation, that he neuer vttered any such words of King <hi>Edward</hi> of Englande, as his aduersarie <hi>Newton</hi> accused him of. And on the other syde, <hi>Newtons</hi> conscience being troubled with his false accusation, argued vnto all the beholders his guilt: For there oppeared in him great timerousues.</p>
            <p>The beholders prayde God for <hi>Hammelton,</hi> for the Souldiers knewe right well that it was <hi>newton,</hi> for his voyce bewrayde him.</p>
            <p>Nowe were the Sticklers in a readinesse, and the Combatours drewe their weapons, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them was fought vi. or vii. blowes verye lustely. But <hi>Hammelton</hi> being meruaylous fierce and eager vpon the truth of his quarell, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayned <hi>Newton</hi> to geeue grounde, almost to the ende of the listes. And if he had driuen him to the <note place="margin">The lawe of Armes.</note> verye ende, then (by the lawe of Armes) he had wonne the conquest, and his enemy shoulde haue bene hanged, if he had not slayne him. <hi>Newton</hi> perceiuing him selfe to be almoste at the poynt of
<pb facs="tcp:2905:57"/>
hanging, stept forwards againe, and gaue <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melton</hi> such a gashe on the legg, that he was not able to stande, but fell downe, and then <hi>Newton</hi> fell on him, and slewe him with his dagger.</p>
            <p>Thus the Cumbat was ended, but the English men that knewe <hi>Newton</hi> to be the rayler, and the false accuser (although by more happ then hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, he had the vpper hande) were very desyrous to renewe Combat againe with him. For there were many Gentlemen theare, that woulde wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly haue ventered their lyues on him, man for man, but he challenged the priuilege of the lawe of Armes, which was vnto him graunted. And the Lorde <hi>Gray</hi> gaue him his owne gowne of his <note place="margin">A good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward yli be stowed, but to maintains the lawe of Armes.</note> backe, and the Chayne that he theu ware. Thus was he well rewarded, that better deserued to haue bene hanged. But he escaped not so: For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes, as he was ryding betweene the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Englande and Scotlande, he was slayne and cutt in pieces. Nowe I will speake of the seege that the Frenche Armye, and the power of Scotlande layde vnto the towne of <hi>Hadington</hi> against the Englishe men.</p>
            <p>When the foresaide Castell was wonne, and the Cumbat finished, the Lorde <hi>Graye</hi> departed towardes <hi>Barwike,</hi> leauing behynde him Syr <hi>Iames Wilford</hi> as generall of the garryson, and 2000 chosen Souldiers vnder him to defend the towne, whiche was not halfe fortifyed before it was besieged of the Frenchemen and Scottes.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:2905:57"/>
For our menne had not bene viii. weekes in it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Mounsier <hi>Dassey</hi> the Frenche kinges lie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>ete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and the <hi>Ringraue</hi> of Fraunce, came to the siege with twentie thowsande Frenchemen, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mames and Scottes, beeing all of them lustye &amp; gallant Souldiers. And at their firste comminge there was a hoat skirmishe betweene them and the Englishe men. And because the Gates of the towne were not of anye strength for defence, our men were constraynde to ramme vp the Gates with earthe, and so mayntaine the defence of the towne vppon the Walles.</p>
            <p>There were many assaultes geeuen to the losse of bothe parties. And in the ende, our enemies did so beat the towne with shott, that they lefte not one whole house for our men to put their heads in: Whereby they were constrained to lye vnder the walles, (for other lodging was there none.)</p>
            <p>They looked for helpe to haue come out of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande, but none came: So that they were in mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable case for lacke of succour. For they were dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to so narrow pushe, that they rent their shurts <note place="margin">A hard shift</note> for lacke of Matche, for other shifte had they none. And also their Enemies had taken awaye their Flankers, whiche was their whole defence of the walles, to expelle them from approching neare whereby to scale. So that by this meanes, the Frenchemen came close vnder the walles of the towne, and were their ouerthwart neyghbours so neare: That the Englyshmen on the one syde, and
<pb facs="tcp:2905:58"/>
the Frenchemen on the other, laye close togeather, that there was no more distaunce of grounde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, then the thicknesse of the walle. Also one of the Bulwarkes was beaten downe so flatte, that a man myght ryde in and out at the breache, but the Frenchemen durste not venter in therat.</p>
            <p>It greeued the Englishe men not a little, to see their euill neyghbours so neare their noses: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, a blunte cuntrey man that was one of our Souldiers, and by his occupation, a maker of Flayles, inuented to beate them from the walles with slayles, and tyed a heauye plummet of lead at the ende of a rope, fastening the other ende of the rope vnto a good truncheon to holde in hys hande, and with suche flayles they slewe and mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a greate many of them.</p>
            <p>This Mounsier <hi>Dassey</hi> captaine generall of the Frenche Armie, was complayned on to the kynge his Maister, for his too muche rashenesse, whereby hee lost manye of his best Souldiers: so that hee was sent for home in great displeasure, and in his place was sent Mounsier <hi>de Termes,</hi> who remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the siege, and came not neare the towne by three myles. But he punished our men worse then the siege, for he layde all the straytes and passages with watche, whereby no victuales coulde bee brought vnto the towne. All this whyle (beeing about xi. weekes) came none out of Englande to the rescue of our besieged menne: Sauing that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:2905:58"/>
syr <hi>Wadam Selinger,</hi> and master <hi>Windam</hi> with a rewe Gentlemen, and three hundreth Souldiers verie ventrousely brake thorough the ende of the Frenche Armie, and brought with them Matche and powder, which was to our men greate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte.</p>
            <p>The scarcitie of victuals among them was so greate, that they were constraynde to eate horses, dogges, cattes, and rattes. And yet neyther the want of clothes, nor the extremitie of the plague, (which was hoat amongst them) nor the lacke of munition, nor the sharpe sawce of hunger coulde beate downe the stowt courage of the Englyshe men, to yelde vp the towne. And yet these extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies before mentioned, made them looke more lyke owgle Monsters, then humayne men. But their worthie and valyant capitaine Sir <hi>Iames Wilford</hi> was such a one, as was able to make of a cowardly beaste, a couragious man.</p>
            <p>During this tyme, the Lorde <hi>Graye</hi> being at <hi>Barwike,</hi> was very carefull for them that were at <hi>Hadington,</hi> but wanted powder to sende to the ayde of them. Notwithstanding he sent xiii. hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred horsemen vnder the conduction of Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Bowse,</hi> and Syr <hi>Thomas Palmer,</hi> not mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that they shoulde offer any battayle, as some (being deceiued) affirme: but to make a showe to comfort the Englishe men withall, that then were comfortlesse. And thinking that vpon the syght of them, the French &amp; Scottish armie would remoue farther of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:2905:59"/>
But they, presumyng further then their commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, gaue a charge on their enemies, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all horsemen (as is aforesaide) were by the Frenche and Scottishe footemen enuironed, and euery man of them (one onely excepted) slayne, &amp; taken prisoners, to the great greefe of our men at <hi>Hadington.</hi> And yet coulde not all this subdue the hartes of them, but lyued in hope.</p>
            <p>And at the laste came the Earle of <hi>Shrewsbery</hi> with xvi. thowsand freshe Souldiers to <hi>Hading<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton:</hi> At whose comming, the Frenche and Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tishe armye left the siege &amp; went to <hi>Edenborovv.</hi> But to see the order of this meeting, would moue <note place="margin">A mournfull meeting</note> the harte of anye man to vtter affeccions with teares. The Earle let fall teares from his eyes, to see that suche valyant men shoulde suffer suche dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse, whose stowt hartes coulde not bee conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with any afflictions. On the other syde, our wearied Souldiers sent out the fountaynes of their eyes, for ioye, to see their deliuerance at hand. Thus with mournfull and ioyfull embrasinges they met. And the Earle came into the town, and supplyed the want both of menne, munition, and victualles, and shortlye after retourned to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande againe, leauing the towne well prouyded.</p>
            <p>Now it fell out, whyle the Frenchemen were at <hi>Edenborovve,</hi> there grewe such debate betweene them and the Scottes, that they fell to bickeringe within them selues, and the Frenchemen flewe certaine Scottes. Whereof, when the Englishe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:2905:59"/>
hearde, they thought that then they myght betake them selues to a little rest, for they had none a great whyle. Then they sent out their Scoutes and a Watche, and so went to suche lodginges as they had. But Mounseur <hi>de Termes</hi> (to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sile the matter againe betweene his men and the Scottes) promysed the Scottes that he woulde winne vnto them the towne of <hi>Hadington</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more delaye. And when the Englishemen <note place="margin">A lustye Canuasado.</note> thought least of their comming: they came, and killed the watche &amp; the Scoutes, &amp; were entred in at the bace courte of the towne before the Larum was geuen. The Englishemen perceiuinge this soddeine irruption, made no delayes to encounter with them: But went thorough a priuie Posterne gate into the bace courte among them, &amp; with the blacke Bill slewe of them (by estimation) v. hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred or more, and droue the rest that escaped ouer the walle, as Sheepe before a Dogge, that happie was he that coulde tumble ouer firste. Thus they retourned with great losse, and no lesse shame, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no boste of their bargaine. I should haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before, of a pretie accident that happened at this siege, which is this.</p>
            <p>When Mounsieur <hi>Dassey</hi> came firste to the <note place="margin">Note.</note> ayde of the Scottes, he was enformed by the Scottes, that there were but a fewe Rascalles &amp; white cotes at <hi>Hadington,</hi> and neyther Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men nor good Souldiers. Whereupon he reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted the olde Queene of Scottes that then was
<pb facs="tcp:2905:60"/>
at <hi>Edenborovgh,</hi> to go to a little Nunnerie that was but a myle from <hi>Hadington,</hi> and thear shee shoulde see the slaughter of all the Englishemen. So shee went to that Nunnerie to beholde the performaunce of this promise. And when shee came thither: shee might see the verye streates of the towne (for it standeth verye lowe.) The En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glishe men vnderstanding of her being in the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the saide Nunnerie, shott off a great Iron peece they had, (which Gunne they called Roring Megge, for the terrible noyse that it rendered) and the Pellet hit part of the Tower that the Queene was in, whereat shee made haste downe (as it was hygh tyme) &amp; rode posting to <hi>Edenborough</hi> without seeing anye harme done to the Englishe menne. And Mounsieur <hi>Dassey</hi> founde other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of fellowes theare, then Rascalles and white cotes (as him selfe reported) geening greate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations of the Englishemen theare.</p>
            <p>Nowe to returne againe to the Canuasado be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned. When our menne had geeuen the Frenchemen that ouerthrowe in the nyght, they gaue the nexte Morning three sharpe assaultes to the towne, and yet tooke the repulse with greate losse of their menne: For they caried away xvi. Cartes and Wagons laden of dead carcases, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they should not be known, besydes three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred that were founde in the base court afore men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cioned.</p>
            <p>You haue reade what scarsitie of victuales was
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:2905:60"/>
among them before, and what pennurie they sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned: Wherefore at the laste, there was made sufficient prouision to victuall the garrison, but not without greate charges, for it was alwayes brought by conuoye, whiche was with greate strength conducted, and neuer without skirmishe. For it was alwayes brought thorough the towne of <hi>Dunbar,</hi> and in the Castell of <hi>Dunbar</hi> laye a garrison of our enemies. And on a tyme, our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitaine Sir <hi>Iames Wilforde</hi> went to meete with the conuoy at <hi>Dunbar,</hi> whiche is viii. myles from <hi>Hadington,</hi> and had with him but xii. menne. And when he had saluted the Lorde Wardon (who then came with the conuoy) the garrison of <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar</hi> Castell came forth &amp; made a shewe in the field. Then sayde the Lorde Warden vnto Sir <hi>Iames Wilforde,</hi> beholde how prowdly your neyghbours stand before vs. Yea (quoth Sir <hi>Iames)</hi> if I had but a fewe of my men more with mee, I woulde offer them some playe. If you will geeue a charge on them (saide the Lorde Warden) you shall haue as many of my men as you will. But because sir <hi>Iames</hi> had no experience of their hardinesse, hee was lothe to trust vnto them. Notwithstandinge in fine he saide, that if they woulde followe him, hee woulde make a gappe thorough them. They promised not to shrinke. So there were about 300 appoynted vnto him, and he went before them ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loping thorough the town in the face of the Castel,
<pb facs="tcp:2905:61"/>
And the shott came so sharpely from the Castell vppon them, that all the menne that professed to followe him durst not, but shrunke backe: sauing onely his owne xii. men. And when he and his small nomber was in the myddes of theire ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, he behaued himselfe very valyantly. But in the ende his horse was slayne vnder him, and hee taken prisoner. But his twelue men being lustie Souldiers, went thorough them againe (being to weake for lacke of nomber to rescue their captain) and so retourned without anye hurte vnto them done. Thus was this noble Captaine taken, and had to the Castel of <hi>Dunbar,</hi> thorough the cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise of them that professed to followe him.</p>
            <p>This did so kindel the brestes of our Garrison that laye at <hi>Hadington,</hi> that the Captaines had muche a doo to perswade them from leauing the towne to fetche him from them againe. For they sayde that they woulde dye on them euerye man, but they woulde winne the Castell of <hi>Dunbar.</hi> And the Scottes knewe right well that they coulde not keepe him thear without great daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: Wherefore they sent him to <hi>Edenborough,</hi> &amp; theare was he kepte prisoner till he was redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Raunsom. He was so noble a capitaine, that he wonne the hartes of all Souldiers. Hee was in the towne among his Souldiers &amp; frinds, a gentle Lamme. In the fielde among his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, a Lyon. To his men, beneficiall. To al men liberall. After whose misfortune, was sent vnto
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:2905:61"/>
               <hi>Hadington</hi> in his steede, Syr <hi>Iames Acroft,</hi> a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Gentleman: whose worthie commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons I omitt, because he being alyue, and in deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued estimation, I myght bee suspecte of flatterie. He was theare by the space of one whole yere, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which tyme, manye noble actes were atchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. And in fine, when the king perceiued howe chargeable a thing it was to keepe <hi>Hadington,</hi> he sent the Earle of <hi>Rutlande</hi> with vi. thousande men thither, who caused the towne to bee rased, and brought awaye all the munition to <hi>Barwike.</hi> And thus was this noble peece of seruice ended.</p>
