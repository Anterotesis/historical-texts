         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN anſwering this TOUCH-STON <hi>of the reformed Gospell,</hi> I thought good to advertiſe thee of ſome things. Firſt, That the <hi>Impudencie</hi> and <hi>malice</hi> of this Pamphleter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide his <hi>Ignorance,</hi> is ſuch, that to make the Proteſtant profeſſion the more odious to his Proſelyts, hee would charge our Profeſſion with ſuch Doctrines and Tenets, which we never taught nor owned, So that whil he fights againſt ſuch, he beats the wind and fights onelie with his owne ſhaddow, A few In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in place of many are theſe. Firſt, §. 5. That we ſay, <hi>That a man by his own private spirit, may rightly judge and interpret Scripture.</hi> Next, §. 6. <hi>That</hi> PETERS <hi>Fayth failled.</hi> 3.
<pb facs="tcp:37352:7"/>
§. 9. <hi>That the Church was not ever to remaine Catholick. 4. §. 10. That the Churches unitie is not neceſſary in all points of Fayth. 5. §. 17. That the actions and ſufferings of the Saynts ſerve for nothing to the Church 6. §. 21. That good works are not neceſſary to Salvation. 7. §. 29. That Angels cannot help us. 8. §. 39. That the bread in the Supper of the LORD is but a figure. 9. §. 45. That Faſting is nos grounded on Scripture, nor cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth any ſpirituall good.</hi> Thus heſeeks not only unneceſſarlie to multiply feigned Controverſies to deceive the ſimple, but alſo to make our Profeſsion the more odious to ſuch as will beleeve him, imitating her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Satan who by like lyeing would made God odious to our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
            <p>2 As if to name onelie, and by a falſe Maſter to multiplie the cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb facs="tcp:37352:7"/>
of Scripture &amp; Fathers were enough, without the ſetting down the words of either; he laboureth to ſeduce ſimple ſoules and make them beleeve, that both Scriptures and Fathers were on their ſide on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, whil as theſe who are judicious and impartiall may ſee that if the maine places of Scripture and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whoſe words he ſets downe, be proven in this my enſueing. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to be either altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent and wreſted, or to make againſt himſelf. Then much more may any judge the like of ſuch pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as he only pointeth at, but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeteth downe, nor dare ſet downe their words. Wherefore 1. As for his references to places of Scripture. Firſt, They are ſuch that if I ſhould particularly diſcuſs their impertinencie, not only ſhould his groſſe ignorace and deceat be ſeen
<pb facs="tcp:37352:8"/>
the more, (which is clearly enough diſcovered (I hope) by my anſwer to ſuch places whoſe words he ſets downe) but my Anſwere ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo grow to a hudge volume, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I ſtrive to as great brevitie with perſpicuitie as I can, and that to make my Anſwere onely to bee a pocket and portable Book. 2. His references, (for oſtentation onely, and deluſion of the ſimple) are ſo numerous, as Pag. 20. for the <hi>Churches infallibilitie,</hi> where hee bringeth but foure places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whoſe words he ſets down, he maketh reference to 22. places, moſt impertine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; wreſted. Like wiſe pag. 59 To prove good works to be <hi>meritorious,</hi> he bringeth but four places of Scripture in likeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but relats to 21. more, which a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to no ſuch purpoſe, the like he does p. 27. 51. 54. 63. 67. 72. &amp; elſwher,
<pb facs="tcp:37352:8"/>
Next, as for his references to the teſtimonies of <hi>Fathers,</hi> mentioning oftimes neither Book, Chapter no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> words, It wer an infinitly laborious task to anſwere, a man knoweth not what, and would likewiſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe to a voluminous bulk, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie ſeing either ignorantlie, or (I may juſtlie fay) deceatfully and impudentlie hee citeth places in Fathers. 1. whom themſelves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as ſpurious and counterfite: For example. In the matter of <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie,</hi> hee citeth <hi>Ambroſe</hi> upon 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. whereas <hi>Bellarmin De ſcriptoribus Eccleſiaſticis,</hi> teſtifieth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>That theſe are thought not be his works and not without cauſe</hi> (ſayeth hee) Againe for Sacramentall <hi>Coufeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> he citeth <hi>Clements</hi> Epiſtles, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his Book of Eccleſiaſticall Writters declareth and proveth to be counterfit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:37352:9"/>
2. Hee citeth ſome works of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which are not <hi>in rerum natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> for example, <hi>For invocation of Saynts,</hi> he citeth ATHANASIUS <hi>Serm. de Annunciatione,</hi> where-as there is no ſuch piece either in his works or in <hi>Bellarmins</hi> index which he hath ſet downe of his works, in his Book of eccleſiaſticall writters. Againe, <hi>For works of Supererogation</hi> he citeth <hi>Gregorie Nicen.</hi> 1. Morals cap. 5. Whereas, he never write any ſuch book, or is it to be found.</p>
            <p>3. Hee citeth ſome places of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for him, who in theſe places are clear againſt him. For example, <hi>for Mans abiiitie to keepe the Law,</hi> hee citeth <hi>Jerome</hi> his third book againſt the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> whereas in that whole booke throughout, hee ſtronglie proveth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trar.</p>
            <p>4. Hee citeth ſome places in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb facs="tcp:37352:9"/>
ſo generallie and looſlie, that it were impoſſible to find out ſuch wherat he he aimeth. For example, <hi>For worſhipping of Images,</hi> he citeth <hi>Jerom</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Marcella,</hi> whereas <hi>Jerom</hi> write many Epiſtles to <hi>Marcella,</hi> in none of which is any ſuch thing to be found. 2. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>predeſtination</hi> hee citeth <hi>Auguſtin.</hi> lib. 1. <hi>de Civit, Dei.</hi> but no Chapter or words, wheras ther are 36.

               <p>The ſecond place is <hi>Revel. 13. 18.

he) then <hi>That Chriſt is come the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time.</hi> To which place I anſwer, 1. That this deceatfull Seducer dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth moſt falſlie and fraudfullie in citing theſe words, as if they were the words of our Bible, whereas the words of our Tranſlation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the originall are theſe, <hi>Whom our Lord ſhall conſume with the spirit of his mouth, &amp; deſtroy with the brightnes of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming,</hi> and in the <hi>Rhemes</hi> tranſlation, it is thus, <hi>whom our Lord Ieſus ſhall kill with the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of his mouth, and ſhall deſtroy with the manifeſtation of his advent.</hi> So that the Apoſtle maketh two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of his deſtruction, The firſt whereof he calleth <hi>a conſumption by the ſpirit of his mouth,</hi> &amp; a conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we know is a lingring diſeaſe, whereby one waſteth away piece and piece. And this is <hi>by the spirit of Gods mouth,</hi> whereby is ſignified

And this conſuming of Antichriſt by this meane, by the preaching of the everlaſting goſpell <hi>Revel</hi> 14. 6. we ſee (praiſed be God) in a good meaſure performed. The ſecond degree he calleth the deſtroying of him altogether by the brightnes, or (as the <hi>Rhemiſts</hi> ſpeake) by the manifeſtatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming. which wee hope in God alſo is drawing verie near.</p>

I am come in my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers name &amp; ye receive me not, if ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall come in his owne name, him yee will receive.</hi> To which I anſwer, 1. That our Saviour ſpeaketh not of Antichriſt ſtrictlie taken, and by way of eminencie, as he is deſcribed by <hi>Paull, 2. Theſſ.</hi> 24. who was to come and appeare after the diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:37352:89"/>
of the ancient Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Empire, but of falſe Prophets that were ſhortlie after Chriſts aſcenſion to ariſe, to deceiue the incredulous Iewes, (as hiſtories report) becauſe they did not beleive, but rejected the true Meſsias. And this their owne <hi>Ferus</hi> declareth to bee the meaning of the place, and diverſe other Romaniſts.</p>
               <p>2. We ſee that the jewiſh Nation onlie were to receive theſe of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our Saviour ſpeaketh. But Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt (of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Apoſtle ſpeakes 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.) was to be an univerſall deceiver of multituds, of peoples, of nations and tongues, which <hi>(Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.</hi> 17. 15.) are called the waters whereon the Whoore ſitteth, and whereunto the papall title of <hi>

               <p>The third place is, <hi>Luke 22. 19. This is my bodie which was given for you.</hi> To which I anſwere, That of theſe words I haue already ſpoken, by which heere they would make Chriſt to haue bene a Maſſe-prieſt, and to haue ſacrificed himſelf the
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:37352:147"/>
night before he was ſacrificed on the Croſſe. And ſo, (contrarie to <hi>Heb. 10. 14.

That neither the ſcripture nor the fathers calleth that a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, which is only a repreſentation &amp; remembrance of a ſacrifice. And becauſe this is their Idoll of the Maſſe, which they adore, therfore I will labour to overthrow this <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi> by ſome few arguments furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by themſelves, as 1. <hi>A ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and Priesthood are relatives</hi> (ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> lib. 1. de Miſſa. cap. 2.) <hi>ſo that to a ſacrifice properly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, a Prieſthood alſo properlie called muſt be correspondent</hi> (ſayeth he) whence it will follow, that if the Maſſe be a ſacrifice properly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the Prieſt muſt be a Prieſt alſo properlie ſo called, and if this bee,

he muſt be either after the order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> which hath ceaſed, or after the order of <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> &amp; this he cannot be, becauſe Chriſt living, and being a Prieſt for ever after that order, he hath no ſucceſſour therein, as we are taught, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 23. 24. Next (ſayeth <hi>Bellar.</hi> in the ſame chapter §. neque) <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedecks ſacrifice was bread and wine,</hi> &amp; ſo ſayth this Pamphleter, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce it will follow that in the Maſſe in likmanner that which is offered up by the Prieſt (giving that he were after the order of <hi>Melchiſedeck)</hi> muſt be bread and wine only, and conſequently not the fleſh &amp; blood of Chriſt by tranſſubſtantiation 3. If they will ſay that it is not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding Chriſts owne bodie and blood that is offered up. then out of <hi>Bellar.</hi> in the ſame place §. 6.

            <p>IN Reſpect of that craftie &amp; cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell practiſe, even to the dead, let be to deceive the living, which our Adverſaries haue uſed of late in purging both out of fathers and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, their own moderne writters, what they find to be againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or for witneſſing the Truth, as their <hi>Index expurgatorius</hi> ſhowes, Leſt that the Reader of this my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to that popiſh PAMPHLET ſhould light on ſuch purged books as I cite, and not finding the words at all, orelſe far changed (as I can inſtance) ſhould think that I had cited them at randon, Therefore having the uncorrupted copyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide me, I haue ſet down with their Names, the place where, and the time when they wer printed.

if the Reader find not the words ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by me, or find them altered in a later impreſsion, he may know, that they haue paſſed thorow that popiſh firie purgatorie of bookes, ordained at <hi>Trent,</hi> and which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is no new trick of the Devill and his ſuppoſts, but hath ben uſed by Hereticks of old, as <hi>Vincentius Lyrinenſis</hi> teſtifieth, who lived in the yeare 430. And examplifieth the ſame in <hi>Origens</hi> works, that ſo by his authoritie hereticks might perſwade men of their errours, which <hi>Origen</hi> never knew.
