            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>To afford a Disciple a <hi>cup</hi> of cold water is a <hi>gift:</hi> But to do it <hi>in the name of a Disoiple,</hi> that argues a Religious inclination; and then 'tis <hi>fruit</hi> too.

            <p>For throughout the various passages of our doubtfull life, what more universally profitable? what more applyable?

            <p>That these gestures may become <hi>fruits</hi> too, make Religion the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse of your outward Actions; let her prompt your feet to go, your eyes to look upward; subject all <hi>your members</hi> unto the Scepter of her direction. <hi>Be</hi> indeed what you would seem to be: For 'tis a shame that your bodies should be more Christian, than your soules; that your tongues should be more ready to <hi>praise,</hi> than your hearts to <hi>conceive</hi> the Lord; Your knees more officious to <hi>bow</hi> to him, than your souls to <hi>adore</hi> him.

            <p>My Text commands yet further, and will needs sit in judgment, even with this exercise at which we are present, it claimes rule in the Pulpit too, and requires, that our Sermons be composed of its two ingredients, that they have in them both <hi>gift</hi> and <hi>fruit;</hi> They must be <hi>gifts</hi> to others, and <hi>fruits</hi> to our selves.

            <p>Neither must our charity <hi>exceed</hi> our Estate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for when a man grows liberal beyond his means, <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>tis as if a vine, in stead of its proper grape<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> should bring forth a gourd.

            </p>
            <p>Thus let each tree bring forth its <hi>own</hi> Fruit; let each mans wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome proportion his contribution to his Estate. Great men must do <hi>great</hi> works; and God may as well expect, that a rich man should <hi>build</hi> a Church, where there is need, as that another should <hi>adorn</hi> it.

            <p>I know, 'tis not our <hi>substance,</hi> but our <hi>Faith,</hi> which commends the work; but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet we may well suspect the Niggards faith, when he gives <hi>too little</hi> of his substance, and he's to be counted a very weak Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, whose covetousnesse shuts his

purse so close, that his Faith can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not open it.

            <p>If our good works be <hi>fruit,</hi> it follows, they ought not to make us <hi>proud,</hi> nor to <hi>puff</hi> us up with any vain imaginations, as though they had <hi>deserved,</hi> that God should fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour us.

            <p>You see Beloved, he is a <hi>misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> object, his condition, and in all

likely hood his wants also, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for a whole Church to exercise their charity upon.

            <p>A generous mind you see, and fit for an Apostles breast; he scorns to be relieved, but by the hand of Faith; and can be as well content with the pangs of hunger, as the Gifts of Infidelity. Indeed, had the <hi>Philippians</hi> been yet but hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:102511:22"/>
my Apostle might with a good conscience have used their bounty, for it came to him by deed of Gift; and there is no fairer Title to any possession: But he is not so content; to please him, they must send, as well <hi>Fruits</hi> as <hi>Gifts,</hi> they must send such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents, as may abound no lesse to <hi>their accounts,</hi> than to his necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; otherwise they may satisfy his <hi>wants,</hi> perhaps, but not his <hi>desire.</hi>

            <p>'Tis a rule in the Mathematicks, that <hi>Rectum est index curvi;</hi> the best way to discover a <hi>Crooked</hi> line is to compare it with one that is <hi>straight.</hi> You know 'tis a straight square that must tell the workman, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his timber be straight, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>even.</p>
            <p>The case is with us, as with <hi>Lines,</hi> Beloved. Men of a <hi>crooked</hi> disposition are then best known,

when they are compared with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of an <hi>upright</hi> heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the onely way to discover a false <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippian,</hi> is to examine his Actions by Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> example. He was in want you heard, and yet desires not <hi>Gifts,</hi> except they were <hi>Fruits</hi> too. How farre then do those <hi>poor</hi> decline from the straight steps of his Apostle, who scarse either <hi>desire</hi> the one, or <hi>respect</hi> the other, but had rather be beholding to their own theft and cousenage, than either to the <hi>Fruits</hi> of other mens Faith, or to the <hi>Gifts</hi> of their vain Glory? Indeed, such men may usurp upon that speech of Saint <hi>Paul, these hands minister to my necessities,</hi> but 'tis not of their <hi>own,</hi> but their <hi>neighbours</hi> goods.</p>
            <p>The covetous person may here examin himself, and strait way discover the errour of his life.

Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was poor, and yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires not wealth; for his content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was his riches. This man abounds in all things, and yet is therefore still poor, because he's not Satisfied. We may (all of us) behold mine Apostle, and from him take a pattern how to rectify our affections: he desires not <hi>Gifts,</hi> but <hi>Fruits;</hi> and delights more in the <hi>Philippians</hi> Faith, than in their liberality.</p>
            <p>This likewise shews the <hi>Crooked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> of those perverse Christians, who preferre their own <hi>profit,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Salvation</hi> of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; and would more delight to see the <hi>Philippians</hi> become their Tributaries, than Christs Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. He that rules a Family must hence learn to take more pleasure, that his servants are <hi>good,</hi> than that they are <hi>profitable:</hi> for if they labour their Masters encrease,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:102511:23"/>
either for hope of reward onely, or for fear of offence, this is but <hi>eye-service,</hi> neither <hi>Fruit,</hi> nor <hi>Gift,</hi> unlesse perhaps ye account that <hi>given,</hi> which ye <hi>pay</hi> for. But when they become Trusty <hi>for conscience</hi> sake, when they are industrious and truly diligent, not as in the sight of man, but God, then are their labours <hi>Fruits,</hi> and a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Master must more joy to see his Servants Faith, than his own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity.</p>
            <p>That your Actions must be <hi>Fruits,</hi> not <hi>Gifts</hi> onely, I have shewed unto you in my First part, from the <hi>Nature</hi> of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; in this Second part I have shewed it from the <hi>Authority</hi> of the Apostles choice. I must reiterate my exhortation once more. <hi>Bring forth Fruits,</hi> if not for these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, yet for your own commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Remember that great <hi>Audit</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:102511:24"/>
which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you must one day make with the Lord of Heaven: then <hi>Fruits</hi> will abound <hi>to your account;</hi> which I made my last part, and must now be handled.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That may abound to your account.</hi> There's a great correspondency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>written</hi> and the <hi>eternal</hi> word; between Christ and the Scriptures. They have both of them <hi>humbled</hi> themselves for us; He to <hi>the death</hi> of the Crosse, This to <hi>the dulnesse</hi> of our capacity. For how often does not the Scripture speak of God, as of a mortal man?

               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:102511:24"/>
saith the Scripture of <hi>David,</hi> first of Kings at the 13th. chapt. how, <hi>Sought?</hi> God is every where, and may spare that enquirie; what needs he to seek, who sees all at once? <hi>Non quod nesciat, ubi sit, quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, sed per hominem, more hominum lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur, quia sic loquendo nos quaerit,</hi> as Saint <hi>Austin</hi> speaks, in the 17. <hi>of the City of God,</hi> at the 5th. chap. he did not seek <hi>David,</hi> because he was ignorant where he was, but he so speaks, <hi>because he seeks us;</hi> for we are then <hi>found,</hi> when we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand him.</p>
            <p>That we might become learned, God is said to have <hi>Books</hi> too; <hi>The Books were opened,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Iohn.</hi> Revel. 20th. that is, the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Testimonies of every ones pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate conscience.

            <p>See then, Beloved, do not such Fruits <hi>abound</hi> to our advantage? they make our God become our Debtour; and our <hi>Accounts</hi> must then needs be easy, when we our selves are become the Creditors; <hi>who gives a Disciple a cup of cold water only, in the name of a Disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward,</hi> saith our Saviour, Mat. the 10th. at the last verse. The thing here to be given is scarce worth the valuing; and yet if this water be <hi>Fruit,</hi> if it issues as well from his heart, that gives it, as from the Fountain from whence it is drawn, how doth it abound to our account? It both <hi>cancels</hi> our

debts, and <hi>entitles</hi> us to a farther Benefit; it gives us, not a <hi>Freedom</hi> only, but a <hi>reward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Are our works then of so high a price? can they both <hi>discharge</hi> the debts we owe, and yet leave us so rich, that we may <hi>purchase</hi> too? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed our Saviour seems to intimate it, <hi>Come yee blessed of my Father, inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the Kingdom prepared for you before the world began,</hi> for your Fruits have abounded to your accounts, <hi>I hungred, and yee gave me meat, I thirsted, and yee gave me drink, &amp;c.</hi> Heres no mention of offences at all: it seems then our works shall both <hi>Satisfie</hi> those debts, and also <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase</hi> a Kingdom for us.</p>

            <p>The Civilians distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Dominium</hi> &amp; <hi>Possessio,</hi> between the <hi>right</hi> of Title, and the <hi>form</hi> of taking possession. You know a man may have Title to what he doth not yet possesse; and a man may wrongfully <hi>possess</hi> that, to which he hath no just Title <hi>Nabouh</hi> had to his vineyard, to wit, Title of inheritance; <hi>the Lord forbid,</hi> saith he to Ahab, <hi>that I should give the Inheritance of my Fathers unto thee,</hi> 1. of Kings, 21. Yet at length Ahab <hi>possest</hi> it, without a Title, for ought we find, unlesse perhaps it were some new Law of Iezabels enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>that the Husband should succeed him, whom the Wife had murthered.</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:102511:27"/>
We may get a right of Title by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for so <hi>Isaack</hi> had it to his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, because he was the Son of <hi>Sarah,</hi> the wife of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> to his possession, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was the Son of <hi>Ionathan,</hi> the Friend of <hi>David.</hi> But 'tis the Act of their own Body usually, whereby men take possession.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Possessio, quasi pedis positio,</hi> say the learned Lawyers, 'tis gotten by setting our foot, and seeming to take up our rest, upon the ground which we meant to possesse. You may remember Ahab <hi>went down</hi> in person to take possession of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoths</hi> vineyard, in the Text before cited. So then we may get a right of Title from the bounty of others, but possession is the Fruit of our own endeavours.</p>
            <p>I apply it; the practice of this le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal course, is no lesse observable in the attainment of the <hi>Everlasting</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:102511:28"/>
Kingdom: for to have a <hi>Title</hi> to it is one thing, <hi>the manner</hi> of posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it another. <hi>If we be Sons, then are we also heirs,</hi> Saith the Apostle; there's our Title, 'tis by a right of Inheritance. <hi>Well done, good and faithful Servant, enter into thy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters joy,</hi> there's the manner of pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing it; 'tis <hi>per pedis positionem,</hi> by setting our feet, and putting our selves resolutely into that <hi>nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row way,</hi> which leadeth unto life, by bringing forth the <hi>Fruits</hi> of Faith, which may abound, and advance us unto this possession.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Calvin</hi> himself hath intimated, what I now observed, in his third Book of Institutions, chap. 17. <hi>In his locis, in these Texts,</hi> saith he, <hi>where Eternal life is called the reward of good works, the Holy Ghost speaks not of life it self, but of the form of enjoying it,</hi> that is, as I understand him, he speaks not of our Title to the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:102511:28"/>
Kingdom, but of the manner how we must possesse it. Without <hi>Fruits</hi> then our <hi>Account</hi> will not be taken; or to speak plainly, and leave this Metaphor, <hi>without good works there's no Salvation.</hi> They are not indeed <hi>the cause,</hi> but they are <hi>the way</hi> to life; They are not the <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> whereby we lay claym to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but yet they serve instead of that <hi>legal form,</hi> whereby we must take possession of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Nor is my Text any way injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to Faith, while it holds good works in so great esteem: for if you observe the word here used by my Apostle, when he mentions the one, he implyes the other; yea and chiefly <hi>extolls</hi> Faith, though he doth not <hi>name</hi> it, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, he saith not, <hi>I desire good works, but I desire Fruit.</hi> They are not esteem'd then for their own sakes, but because they grew upon the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:102511:29"/>
               <hi>Stemm</hi> of Faith. He that loves an <hi>Israelite,</hi> because he is the Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi> loves <hi>Abraham,</hi> more than he doth the <hi>Israelite;</hi> and so he that desires good works, because they are the <hi>Fruits</hi> of Faith, honours Faith, more than he doth good works. For our affection looks <hi>chiefly</hi> at that which <hi>first</hi> moves it, and therefore the cause, why we respect any thing, is still more in our account, than the Thing it self.</p>
            <p>Names of Relation alwayes bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie our understanding, and by a si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent kind of Command make us to search farther than the Thing we hear. If we call the <hi>Rechabites</hi> no more but <hi>good men,</hi> our apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion confines it self unto their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons only; but when we Stile them <hi>obedient Sons,</hi> we can hardly abstain from making some farther enquiry touching their Father <hi>Ionadab.</hi> So,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:102511:29"/>
had it been here said, <hi>Good works abound,</hi> we might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have sought no further than into their <hi>desert,</hi> but the name of <hi>Fruit,</hi> which is given them, makes us enquire for the <hi>Tree</hi> on which they grow, and silently enformes our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, that <hi>good works do therefore abound to our account,</hi> because they are the <hi>Fruits</hi> of Faith, that saves us. So then, 'tis <hi>Faith that justifies,</hi> both our selves, and our works too: it makes us of Sinfull men become the children of God; and it makes our works, of unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Actions, become <hi>Fruits;</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding unto our Eternal Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>Where's now the forehead of that Romish strumpet, who dares affirm, that our Doctrine <hi>hinders</hi> good works, and that without
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:102511:30"/>
blushing too? Indeed we must not say <hi>they merit;</hi> that were as false as dangerous, and the ready way to make us men, become rather <hi>proud</hi> than <hi>honest:</hi> yet we averr, without good works there's no Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and in mine Apostles phrase, that without such <hi>Fruit,</hi> we shall fail in <hi>our account:</hi> our Master will <hi>be wroth with us,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us <hi>over</hi> to the <hi>Tormentor,</hi> to lye in prison, till we pay all that's <hi>due</hi> to him, which will be to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>If this be not a sufficient induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to good works, what is? who can move him, that regards neither the losse of Heaven, nor the gaining of hell? nor do I well see, how our adversaries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves should present us with a greater motive; unlesse perhaps they will have the confidence to tell us, that the Fire of Hell is not
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:102511:30"/>
so hot, but burns more gently and softly than that of Purgatory. 'T were to be wished indeed, that in this point, our <hi>lines</hi> were as well able to give <hi>Rome</hi> the lye, as our <hi>Doctrine</hi> is; she might then see, as well as read, that the reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Church, can be both good, and humble too; and knows both to be rich in the Fruits of Faith, and yet to rely onely upon Christs satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
            <p>I conclude with that of Saint <hi>Austin,</hi> in the 23th. chapter of his <hi>Confession. Germinet anima nostra opera misericordiae,</hi> Let our souls <hi>Bud</hi> and <hi>Bring forth</hi> the works of mercy: pitty the Fatherlesse, have compassion on the poor, relieve those that are in distresse, lend a tender and favourable ear to the widdows groanes; Be ye <hi>members one of another,</hi> by compassion and a lively sense of your Brethrens suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:102511:31"/>
and be ye members <hi>one to another</hi> by the free help of your Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence and Chatity. Be Eyes to the blind, be Feet to the lame, be Hands to them that cannot, through age or other impotency, labour for themselves. In a word, give Almes, every man according to his Estate, liberally, frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, constantly worship God humbly and devoutly, do all kind of good works with Diligence, Faithfullnesse and Sincerity; So shall your <hi>Fruit</hi> abound, not onely to your <hi>own,</hi> but to the <hi>Churches</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; the Church shall have wherewith to answer her Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries in this world, and your selves wherewith <hi>to satisfy</hi> that great Judge of account in the world to come: which God of his mercy grant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>EXamples give life to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts: for as they usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make us conceive with ease, what otherwise we should
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:102511:32"/>
hardly understand; so do they cause us to practise with encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, what without them (perhaps) we should scarse at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. Precepts indeed may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but it is their examples, that perswade <hi>obedience</hi> with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est facility; the reason is, because they both imply matter of <hi>Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which is as a spurre in many cases, unto mens spirits, and likewise exclude <hi>impossibility,</hi> by shewing that the thing, which is commanded us, may be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>That we must in all things <hi>obey the voice of the Lord our God</hi> is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept better known than observ'd; and what can be more availeable to enforce our performance of this command, than the consideration of <hi>Abrahams</hi> example? For canst thou stick to abandon the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thy vitious Associates, when
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:102511:32"/>
he, to avoid occasion of sinne, leaves both <hi>his kindred and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers house?</hi> Canst thou forbear strangling thine in ordinate affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and lusts, when thou seest him, in obedience to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of that great Law giver, turn <hi>Executioner</hi> to the Fruit of his own loynes, and rather than not to be the <hi>child</hi> of God, is content to be no longer the Father of his dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest <hi>Isaack?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But amongst all the several kinds of <hi>Inducements,</hi> that are apt to work upon us, and to move us to do this or that, there is none that more effectually stirs our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, than the <hi>good examples</hi> of those who seem most exposed to ignominy and disgrace. For we can hardly brook the worthy At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements of our <hi>Equals</hi> in any kind, but we disdain and are vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to see our selves out-stript by
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:102511:33"/>
our <hi>inferiours.</hi> And therefore that fabulous Philosopher, <hi>Aesope</hi> I mean, did very wisely; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing desirous to incite and bring his Auditours to a more vertuous course of life, chose rather to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint them with the <hi>Annals</hi> of Beasts, than men; to the end that they might be ashamed to see <hi>sense</hi> out go <hi>reason,</hi> and to observe those silly creatures performing the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which either sluggish negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence made them <hi>unable,</hi> or their crooked and perverse dispositions <hi>unwilling</hi> to execute.</p>
            <p>This one example, which my <hi>Text</hi> proposeth, affords variety of such inducements. For if thou beest possessed with a generous Spirit, and apt to emulate the Actions of great men, Behold, here is <hi>Herod</hi> a Prince to be imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: but if thy drowsie affections permit thee not to look up, nor to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:102511:33"/>
be awaked with such Alarmes, yet blush notwithstanding to see thy self outstript by <hi>Herod,</hi> a man whom the Gospel hath noted out, as notoriously infamous, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestuous person, and a murtherer: Is it not a shame then for thee, to contemn the Ministers of God, or to abuse his servants, to whom in this place <hi>Herod</hi> himself doth <hi>reverence?</hi> To be backward and slothfull in attending to his word, which <hi>Herod</hi> here again and again <hi>receives with gladnesse?</hi> lastly, would it not argue great want of Grace in thee to be an <hi>idle hearer</hi> onely, when we in this Text find <hi>Herod</hi> himself <hi>doing,</hi> readily <hi>doing</hi> and performing <hi>many</hi> good deeds?</p>
            <p>Consider I say, and blush at these circumstances, thou who ever thou art, that hast not as yet attained to <hi>Herods</hi> perfection. Think how farre short thou comest
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:102511:34"/>
of those duties, which that last and great day shall exact of thee: Seeing that the charity of our best Divines cannot so farre o'rerule their judgments, as to make them think this <hi>Galilaean</hi> Prince, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all these Actions, to have gone any whit beyond a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. For although considered in their own nature, the <hi>many things,</hi> which he is here said to have done, were doubtlesse good and truly commendable before men, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing stain'd with infidelity, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the ill manner of the performance of them, they were as farre from the perfection of a true good work, in the sight of God, as himself was in person from the privilege of a true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Israelite; to which yet (as some say) he was not unwilling to pretend.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:102511:34"/>The Actions here specified are Three.<list>
                  <item>First, <hi>the respect</hi> which <hi>Herod</hi> shewed to the Ministers of the word, and withall to the line of <hi>Aaron;</hi> for <hi>Iohn</hi> was heir to the course of <hi>Abia,</hi> being, as the Gospel shews and calleth him, <hi>filius Zachariae,</hi> the Son of <hi>Zachariah</hi> the Priest. <hi>He feared Iohn, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served him.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Secondly, <hi>the entertainment,</hi> the joyfull <hi>entertainment,</hi> which <hi>Herod</hi> gave to the word it self, which <hi>Iohn</hi> preached. <hi>And when he heard him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>he heard him gladly.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Thirdly, <hi>the Reformation,</hi> or good effect, which <hi>Iohns</hi> Sermons, or preaching, wrough upon <hi>Herod. He did many things, &amp;c.</hi> Each of these apart in their order, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a particular discovery of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:102511:35"/>
their several imperfections, are to be the subject of my present dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course; it being my desire and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent principally, to acquaint you with the fair progress, which a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate may seem to make in god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, and yet how farr he comes short of true Grace and Salvation.</item>

               <p>You may thence conjecture, that our fore-Fathers did highly esteem the Priests office, because it was so often, in their time united unto the Kings Authority. <hi>Majorum haec erat consuetudo, ut Rex esset etiam Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdos &amp; pontifex:</hi> 'Twas a custom among the Antients, that he that was King, should be likewise Priest, as <hi>Isidore Hispalensis</hi> obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in the 7th. of his Etymoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicks, at the 12th. chapter.

               </p>
               <p>The Gentiles, though as yet they had not attayned to the Faith of <hi>Israel,</hi> that is, unto the true knowledge of Almighty God and his Law, yet in this particular they thought not amisse to imitate the custom of <hi>Israel:</hi> among them there was.</p>

               <p>Thus did those elder times think Holiness the chiefest policy: and therefore held him as most able to <hi>Reign,</hi> whom they saw to be most fit to <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> This Antient pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice seems not a little to justifie a Maxime of our own times. <hi>Rex,</hi> lay we, <hi>est persona mixta cum Sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,</hi> the King himself is partly a Clergy-man: his office then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes a Priesthood, and bids him not to <hi>rule</hi> only, but to <hi>pray</hi> for his People.</p>
               <p>Consult the Pagan Antiquities,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:102511:36"/>
and you will find strange variety of Honour conferred upon the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of their supposed Deities. <hi>Romulus</hi> stiled them <hi>Kings,</hi> as if he meant to have enlarged their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er unto the height of his own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. And when afterwards the <hi>name</hi> of a King became as odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous at <hi>Rome,</hi> as the real oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Tyrant was to other Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet was she still content, that the chief <hi>Master</hi> of her religious <hi>Ceremonies</hi> should retain the old Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and be styled <hi>Rex Sacerdotum,</hi> or the Priestly King. I might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with the large Immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Privileges which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, with the strange Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Honour, wherewith they were little lesse than adored, did they not contain as great an excess of <hi>Superstition,</hi> as they did aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of <hi>Reverences?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This will be sufficient to prove
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:102511:37"/>
that they were both <hi>fear'd</hi> and <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd,</hi> that in succeeding ages, the <hi>Caesars</hi> themselves became ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of the Priesthood, as <hi>Sueto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>The Relations even of our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern times are not without some parallel examples likewise. <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the Archbishop of <hi>Ebora</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> as you may find in the late Spanish Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: and <hi>Possevine</hi> the Jesuite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates this of the Russian Monarch, otherwise called the great Duke of <hi>Muscovie, Rex Sacrorura simul et Imperator videri velit,</hi> he doth as much affect to be thought <hi>chief in their holy Ceremonies,</hi> as to be held <hi>chief in his Empire:</hi> And therefore his Robes are Copes, his Crown a Miter, and in stead of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Scepter he arms his left hand with a Crosiers staff.</p>
               <p>Neither did the purer years of the Christian Church shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves any whit negligent, in the performance of so Religious a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; being no way ignorant of that Doctrine, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted unto his <hi>Timothy. Let the Elders,</hi> saith he, <hi>that rule well be had in double honour; especially those which labour in the word and doctrine.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. Indeed for those for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Titles of Soveraignty, as I read them not offer'd, so neither could they have been accepted by the Ministers of the Gospel, they having received prohibition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it from their Masters own mouth, <hi>vos autem non sic, The Kings of the Gentiles reign over them, and they that bear rule among them are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Benefactours: But you shall not be so.</hi> Luke the 22. Yet if we enquire
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:102511:38"/>
into the cariage of those Elder Christians, we shall easily find, that what was wanting in those swelling Titles of Eminency, was supplied in the Truth of sincere af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. So the Apostle himself witnesseth of his <hi>Galathians</hi> in the 4th. <hi>chap.</hi> of his Epistle to them. <hi>Yee received me as an Angle of God, yea as Christ Iesus; nay I bear you record, that if it had been possible, you would have plu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

If <hi>love</hi> and <hi>affection;</hi> they could have spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red even <hi>their own eyes</hi> to have sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed his necessities.</p>
               <p>But is the practice of our present times answerable? doth it equal the se precedents of the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:102511:38"/>
age? do you <hi>fear and observe?</hi> nay do you not rather scorn and neglect our profession? else what's the cause that the most liberal and ingenuous dispositions are fearful to undertake this worthy calling? what hinders them, but only the publike contempt aud much igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny, which in these times they see openly attends the Ministry? For doubtlesse, if a mans reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be his second life, you may now justly call <hi>Orders</hi> a kind of Martyrdom; because I am sure, he hazards his account in the world much for Christs sake, whosoever in our dayes puts himself apart to serve the Tabernacle.</p>
               <p>How are we contemn'd by the greatest? and injured by those of meaner rank? do not the scorners deride us? and the <hi>Drunkards make songs upon us?</hi> nay is not our very Function become a Proverb of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:102511:39"/>
even in their mouths, whose education hath ever been as ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile, as their birth was base? There are perhaps of our <hi>Masters in Israel,</hi> that can with <hi>Nicodemus</hi> be content, to afford us countenance by candle light, I mean, in private, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the absence of those high-bred Spirits, who count it basenesse to entertain discourse with people of so mean Quality, as we are in their esteem.</p>
               <p>But are the times so strangely altered? are we now thought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to accompany them, whom Antiquity held us fit to govern? 'Twas his Majesties late observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, before a most honourable and judicious Assembly, that the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy was never grown into such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt as now; and in his opinion 'twas one of those great offences, which argued the near approach of the latter day. There he enjoyned
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:102511:39"/>
his Judges to countenance us, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted his People to reverence and respect us; God continue so graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Prince, that reigns even in these dayes, to become a Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: and let all those, that wish well to the house of <hi>Aaron</hi> say A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Amen. For should not <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> I mean the Scepter it self, stand firm to <hi>Levi,</hi> the other Tribes would be as ready to prey upon us, as they are now to scorn us.</p>
               <p>Yet could the practice of former ages work any alteration upon these latter times, I should not doubt but to leave this Auditory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as carefull of our <hi>Estimation</hi> here on earth, as we professe to be (and in some measure, I hope, are) of your <hi>Welfare</hi> in Heaven. My speech hath already laid open the <hi>exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> of the Patriarks and purer Church to instruct you; of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans and Infidels, to stir up and

But if through hardnesse of heart you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main still unmoveable, yet quake and tremble to think, how this <hi>Herod</hi> in my Text shall one day rise up in Judgement against you, and shall condemn you; for he <hi>fear'd</hi> and <hi>observ'd</hi> the Baptist, and I say unto you, it may be spoken of the meanest Minister of the Gospel of Christ, <hi>A greater than Iohn is here.</hi>

               <p>Thus <hi>Calvin</hi> understands the Text, and I find him accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his exposition with the best of our own Interpreters.

Only <hi>Maldonate</hi> the Jesuite chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth this Gloss, as injurious to the Baptist. What shall each pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Minister, each Priest and Deacon be thought greater than <hi>Iohn?</hi> yea, Jesuite, why not? your own <hi>Abulensis</hi> in his thirty fourth question upon St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth as much. <hi>Quantò de Messiâ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertior, tanto major Propheta.</hi> We Ministers are Prophets too, and we are therefore <hi>the greater,</hi> because the <hi>playner</hi> Prophets.</p>
               <p>Surely this Jesuite fears to be out-stript <hi>by Herod</hi> in his respects to <hi>Iohn,</hi> and therefore we shall find him more <hi>observant,</hi> than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary. Hear therefore, if you please, his Commentary upon the Text, <hi>The least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he,</hi> that is, saith he, <hi>the least of them that receive the Gospel.</hi> How? may the least Christian be greater than <hi>Iohn,</hi>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:102511:41"/>
and yet not the least Minister? He's very observaunt indeed. <hi>Iohn</hi> shall take place both of <hi>Elias,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> of Apostles and Prophets, yet <hi>Demetrius</hi> and his Crafts-men may have the wall of him. There are of his Church, I confesse, that go sarr beyond this <hi>Herod</hi> in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance; they have taken the paines to climb Heaven it self, as it may seem, to do the Baptist some shew of Honour. For <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> in his fourth <hi>Tract</hi> upon the <hi>Magnificat,</hi> with <hi>Maironius,</hi> and from them another Jesuite <hi>Barradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> give him confidently the third place in Heaven, that is, next to our Saviour and his <hi>Virgin-Mother;</hi> in the <hi>very same Throne</hi> say they, from whence <hi>Lucifer</hi> fell. Great <hi>observance</hi> indeed, if there were as <hi>good</hi> ground for it.</p>
               <p>But I go on, Had this <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>observance</hi> been done by <hi>Herodias;</hi>

had she with <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> of a lewd Strumpet become an humble <hi>Paenitent,</hi> the example had not been so much worthy the noting; in as much as the tendernesse and instability of her sexe might argue (possibly) some easiness in her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version also; or had they been performed by <hi>Philip,</hi> the forsaken husband of <hi>Herodias,</hi> it had been no great marvail; no great mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, I say, to see a man injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously disgrac'd by his Brothers lust, and perhaps not well able to revenge himself, to think of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd life, ro renounce the World, and become follower to a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, in the Wildernesse, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to such a Prophet as the Baptist was, whose zeal had all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made him a party in his quarrel.</p>

               <p>But upon a more strict inquiry into the nature of the Action, we shall find it I doubt to issue from some bastard fountain; to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed at best from <hi>Morality,</hi> rather than from <hi>Religion.</hi> My Text dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers it plainly. Herod <hi>feared</hi> and <hi>observed</hi> Iohn, <hi>knowing him to be a just man and an holy.</hi> See, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect which was given to <hi>Iohn,</hi> was given to his <hi>person,</hi> not to his <hi>office:</hi> Herod observed him for those personal deserts, or merits,

which he saw in the <hi>Man,</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was a <hi>Prophet,</hi> and the forerunner of so great a Majesty. To be short he honoured <hi>Iohn,</hi> but not the Baptist.</p>

               <p>But thou, who intendest after a right manner to regard and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence Gods Ministers, consider not so much <hi>what they are,</hi> as <hi>from whom they come;</hi> and the respect, thou affordest them, give it not so much for their own sakes, as for his that sent rhem.

               </p>
               <p>Nor doe I altogether condemn this Action of <hi>Herod:</hi> For <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>observance</hi> are matters of <hi>due Debt</hi> unto Justice and Holinesse; such qualities deserve respect: yet neither can I commend it, I mean, as a work <hi>truly good.</hi> The reason is, I find it not performed with any relation to the Author of goodnesse, without respect to whose Glory, our best Actions may be goodly perhaps, but yet

               <p>For my Evangelist, if you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve him, makes the Kings good inclination towards <hi>Iohn,</hi> the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advocate to plead for him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the wicked suggestions of <hi>Herodias;</hi> who did not more pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionately desire the pleasure of her incestuous bed, then she did the destruction of him, who durst control her; <hi>Herod</hi> then must needs be truely of himself well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined towards <hi>Iohn,</hi> otherwise he neither would nor could have so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

resisted her entreaties, whose affections had enthralled him, and who desired nothing of him, but the silencing of that tongue, whose publike reprehensions were as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to his own honour, as to her contentment.</p>
               <p>But if we admit <hi>Herod</hi> to have been <hi>indeed</hi> a joyfull receiver of the word, we must acknowledge also some congruous and little cause of this his gladnesse, and so necessarily allow him <hi>Faith,</hi> no lesse free from hypocrisie, than his <hi>joy</hi> was from dissimulation and fiction. For otherwise it were a strange prodigie, and as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to nature, as to see Grapes grow upon Thornes, or Figs on on Thistles. Joy, or rejoycing in good things, (if it be true) is a Fruit of the Spirit, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore necessarily supposeth Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is the first work of Spirit in

us, and the root and fountain of all others: And granting this, what other thing do we but plead for <hi>Arminius,</hi> and bring in this Eastern Prince to grace his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph? For here's <hi>Herod,</hi> a man <hi>truely Faithfull,</hi> you say, because <hi>truely glad</hi> or truely affected with the preaching of the word; and if Faithfull, <hi>justified</hi> also; for who dares deny the consequence? and yet I fear his <hi>Absolution</hi> is now cancelled, and that whatsoever he once was, he is now no better than a reprobate.</p>
               <p>Hence therefore, namely by granting that <hi>Herods</hi> gladnesse at the Preaching of the word was <hi>Sincere</hi> and unfeigned, it may seem to follow what <hi>Arminius</hi> labours to conclude, to wit, <hi>that a man truely justified may afterwards full from Grace,</hi> and become a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.</p>

not of <hi>Illumination</hi> only, but of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</hi> The Scripture, 'tis confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, stiles them both by the name of <hi>Faith,</hi> but the one is a <hi>bare assent</hi> only unto the Doctrine preached, the other is a <hi>confident application</hi> of it; <hi>wee,</hi> saith that elect Apostle, <hi>have confidence by Faith in him, Ephes.</hi> 3. at the 12th. verse.</p>
               <p>Lastly they both produce a <hi>glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;</hi> this pure and <hi>Spiritual,</hi> out of a sense of the forgivenesse of Sins; <hi>being justified by Faith we have peace with God, Rom.</hi> 5. at the 1. that other impure, <hi>carnal,</hi> and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stirr'd up by the force of some Worldly motives. So were the Philosophers at <hi>Athens</hi> most <hi>glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> desirous to hear the Doctor of the Gentiles, not because their Souls were joy'd with the sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his Doctrine, but because their ears listened after Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:102511:51"/>'Twas a story to them that seem'd to deserve attention, to hear of a Deity Incarnate, of a God crucifyed; and that to the Immortality of the Soul, which they had learn'd from nature, the Gospel now added the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Body. The strangenesse of such Doctrine as this, must needs delight, and give satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, no lesse to a Curious, than to a Godly Auditour.</p>
               <p>How could the Doctrine of Christian liberty but be welcome to many irreligious and loose peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in <hi>Hierusalem?</hi> how could that news want ready entertainment, that promised such absolute and present freedom, both to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the bondage of those annual ceremonies, and to their children also from the pain and peril of Circumcision? Iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Faith must needs <hi>joy</hi> them,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:102511:52"/>
that are loath to be at the charge of good Works; and free remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Sins is so plausible a Theme, that I fear it makes many think, they are scarse put to the trouble of Beleeving.</p>
               <p>How many <hi>joyful</hi> hearers do these times afford, who yet never in their life desired, much lesse labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to attain a sense of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenesse of Sins? Their joy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployes it self about other matters. The Preacher's eloquent, perhaps; and then his pleasing periods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand their attention. Perhaps he's bitter; and then they are tickled with the display of their Neighbours vices; and begin to take it for a kind of Innocency, that other men are as bad as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Nay are they not those, that presse with eagernesse into these Assemblies, only that they may find, wherewith to busie their
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:102511:52"/>
detracting humours? Here he wanted Art; there diligence; these lines were too carelesse; that strain too affected. <hi>Quibus plus Displices, si ominem sine aspiratione dixeris,</hi> saith St. Austin, <hi>quam si hominem oderis,</hi> men that had rather you should break a Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than offend a Grammar rule; and think it a greater fault to mispronounce a mans name, than to murther his reputation. But let such Auditours know, <hi>ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis, non auribus loquimur,</hi> (as <hi>Seneca</hi> hath it) we speak to your <hi>consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,</hi> not to your <hi>ears,</hi> and desire, not so much to please, as to save your Souls.</p>
               <p>I much wonder therefore at our English <hi>Arminius,</hi> I mean <hi>Thomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> in the 5. chapter of his <hi>Diatri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba,</hi> that makes the difference, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Scripture as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, between the wavering or
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:102511:53"/>
                  <hi>Temporary,</hi> and <hi>Iustifying</hi> Faith, to be only <hi>temporis tantum aut gradus, non rei et essentiae,</hi> that is, that they differ not <hi>essentially</hi> and in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture one from another, but <hi>gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,</hi> and in respect of <hi>time, durance</hi> and <hi>perseverance</hi> only. So that <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary</hi> Faith (with him) so long as it <hi>continues,</hi> is as true Faith, as that which continues for ever. And hence indeed it follows easily, that a man, though qualifyed only with that fading imperfection of a Temporary Faith, yet for the time that such Faith continueth in him, must needs be justified before God; and when it fails, that his <hi>Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> also ceaseth and is broken off: and so the Title of his <hi>Diatriba</hi> is made good, <hi>de interscisione Gratiae,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But surely the Truth is farr o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise: Those things are distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd <hi>essentially,</hi> and in nature,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:102511:53"/>
that differ as I have shewed these to do, that is to say first in <hi>the cause.</hi> The <hi>Temporary</hi> Faith proceeding only from some general and inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our operation of the Holy Spirit, commonly incident unto reprobates and wicked men, who doubtlesse feel many times Impulses, and as it were Knockings of the Spirit at the dore of their hearts, which yet are never opened to any true Conversion: whereas <hi>Iustifying</hi> Faith proceeds from that supreme and most special working of the Spirit, which is proper to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and alwayes effectual to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Secondly they differ in the <hi>things</hi> themselves, or in their <hi>Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition:</hi> That, viz. <hi>Temporary</hi> Faith, being only a <hi>bare assent</hi> unto the Doctrine preached; This, a <hi>confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> and lively <hi>application</hi> of it to ourselves, and to our own Souls. Thirdly in <hi>their effects:</hi> This, to wit,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:102511:54"/>
                  <hi>Iustifying</hi> Faith being the Fountain and Source of true <hi>Spiritual</hi> joy and comfort; that other only of what is false and <hi>carnal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We need not fear then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse <hi>Herod</hi> a reprobate, and yet acknowledge him to have given most <hi>joyful</hi> entertainment to <hi>Iohns</hi> preaching, and that <hi>unfeignedly</hi> and in good earnest. For as Tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Faith may be the Mother of an unfeigned joy, which yet is not presently to be thought commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, only because it is not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit. For <hi>Herod</hi> might take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in some carnal circumstances, more than in the principal matter preached; as to hear him tell of a <hi>Messiah</hi> that was to come, of his strange Baptism, that he would Bapt ze men <hi>with fire;</hi> of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the <hi>Messiah's</hi> person, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Iohn,</hi> (whose grave Aust<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

complemental excesse) confessed himself not worthy to <hi>untye the the latchet of his Shooe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He might be affected with his grave discourse, and Treatings of Justice, Temperance, Fortitude and other Princely qualities, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with doubtlesse the Baptist knew very well how to entertain him. For virtue loves to shew its lustre, and will seem admirable some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times even in the eyes of vice it self. Now how could it but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce a King, to hear those, no lesse politique, than Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, copied out in the third of <hi>Luke,</hi> where in at once he taught the people charity, the Publicars conscience, the Souldiers content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and modesty? Thus did he ease <hi>Herod</hi> in governing, and make Religion supply that, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise would require the Princes Authority.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:102511:55"/>There is then a twofold <hi>Truth</hi> to be considered in our joy, <hi>rei &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonae. Herods</hi> Person was truly glad, but his joy had made choise, and fix<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>d it self upon a false object; and therefore false, because 'twas fading. For we may not think he rejoyced in any sense which he had of the remission of his Sins; for then we should have read him like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise partaker of <hi>Iohns</hi> Baptism, which was preambulatory to it: nor that he put any confident assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the preached <hi>Messias;</hi> for then he would not have arayed him in white, and so mocked and despised him as he did, no, <hi>cade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat hic semen in terram petrosam,</hi> all this seed fell <hi>upon stony ground:</hi> and that you may know that it did so indeed, by and by it <hi>Sprung up;</hi> you may see a blade of it, almost as soon as it is sowen: for so the Text addeth, <hi>He did many things:</hi>

            <p>Those worshippers, who have been once purg'd, are no more troubled with a conscience of Sins. That's his <hi>Major</hi> proposition.</p>
            <p>But the Jews, after all their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, were still burthened with a conscience of Sins: for otherwise what needed those annually repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted oblations for the same offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? There's his <hi>Minor.</hi>

               <p>Conscience then is that Judicial Facultie of the Soul, whereby we apply our general knowledge, of what is good and ill, unto each particular Action; and so both en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns performance of the thing it approves, and condemnes every adventure and attempt that we make upon the contrary.</p>

that faith, which the Synagogue professed, was therefore necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attended with a <hi>conscience of sins,</hi> because she expressely taught and prescribed to her followers, <hi>a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iteration</hi> of sacrifices: for that must needs cause them to suspect the sufficiency of each former <hi>Atton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> But the very Tenour of our most holy profession <hi>fully cures</hi> us of that <hi>doubting</hi> disease: in as much as it plainly assured us, that Christ having once <hi>suffered,</hi> the wrath of God exacts no further <hi>satisfaction.</hi> So my Apostle in the 9th. chap. of this present Epistle at the 26th. verse. <hi>In the end of the world,</hi> saith he, <hi>hath he appeared once to put away sinne by the sacrifice of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi>

               <p>So that it may seem now a point of injustice to deny the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, the Title of <hi>universal,</hi> seeing she so friendly communicats with all Religions.</p>
               <p>I, but yet <hi>Rome</hi> will still seem Orthodox for all this, and hath learn't from her <hi>Doctors</hi> of <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation,</hi> at least to evade and delude, where she cannot satisfy.

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:102511:73"/>
alone (which yet were more than enough, where such a Majesty dictates the words) let him not I say barely pronounce, but logically prove and conclude, that Christ <hi>can but once be offered up,</hi> sheel make him understand it <hi>de sacrificio cruento,</hi> onely of the bloody Sacrifice of the Crosse, not of that unbloody one of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar; and so with the same words, both corrupt his sense, and yet seem to condescend to his conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
               <p>Thus doth Truth never suffer more dangerous attempts, than when she falls into the hands of learned impiety. But my Text soon quits her, by the suggestion of this one <hi>interrogatory.</hi> After Christ his bloody passion, remains there a conscience of sinnes or no, <hi>ex parte victimae?</hi> do our affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoughts <hi>as yet</hi> inform us, that

                  <hi>the greatnesse</hi> of our sinnes exceeds the <hi>sufficiency</hi> of his <hi>oblation?</hi> if so, then is the sacrifice of the Crosse, as insufficient as were those of the Jewes: but if this <hi>doubt be</hi> abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely removed, which my Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle cleerly enough insinuates in the Text, then is their sacrifice of the Altar, as Sacrilegious, as were those of the Gentiles.

which questionlesse was long before pronounced in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.

               <p>A strange remedy you might think, to cure involuntary sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse by <hi>mourning</hi> willingly, were it not therefore to be esteemed the more availeable, because humane wisdome counts it foolish and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper.</p>

               <p>Nor do I still <hi>enjoyn</hi> thee to call a <hi>Confessor</hi> to witnesse; as if thy <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> were of necessity to be as <hi>legal,</hi> as thy <hi>Testament;</hi> if thou wilt, confesse <hi>onely</hi> to that Judge, who <hi>alone</hi> can absolve thee; yet sure I am, in case of great distresse, open and free confession to a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Minister is most availeable, both to cure a <hi>conscience of sinne,</hi> as also to attain a <hi>sense</hi> and feeling of

their <hi>forgivenesse;</hi> although the sentence of the Minister, 'tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, be of it self no <hi>Absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

               <p>For example, who knowes not, that Gods word barely spoken, is of it self able to challenge our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief? yet hath Divine goodnesse been so indulgent to humane infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, as to make <hi>words visible</hi> for our sake, that is, to ordain sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, (which are commonly, and not unfitly called by Divines, <hi>visible words</hi>) and to make us <hi>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Although therefore the promise of remission of sinnes, <hi>at what time soever a sinner repents him of his sinne,</hi> Ezek. 18. should be as <hi>persuasive,</hi> as

'tis <hi>certain,</hi> and induce into us a confidence of forgivenesse, no lesse easily and effectually, than the words sink into our ears; yet hath God been pleased also to invest his Ministers <hi>with the power of the keies,</hi> to the intent, that seeing a man clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with our own flesh, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent his person, and now ready, as from his mouth, to pronounce our absolution, our thoughts might be quickned, our spirits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, and our consciences become as free and exempt from <hi>doubting,</hi> as his promise is from <hi>mutability</hi> or change.</p>
               <p>You know 'tis the very Tenour of our great Commission, sealed unto us by that King of Kings, our most Blessed Saviour, in the 20. of St. <hi>Iohns</hi> Gospel. <hi>Receive the Holy Ghost; whose soever Sins yee remit, they are remitted unto them.</hi> Not that these words imply a <hi>Iudiciary</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;

First</hi> we loose on earth, and <hi>then</hi> God in Heaven.</p>
               <p>But what, you'l say, doth the <hi>Ministerial</hi> Act go before the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal?</hi>

may we <hi>declare</hi> what God hath not yet <hi>decreed?</hi> that were to play the Kings Interpreter, while he is silent; or to publish a proclamation before it be penn'd. These seem to be great inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>
               <p>We must therefore understand, that upon the hearty and true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition of a penitent Soul, first God himself <hi>decrees</hi> his Absolution, then after his humble Confession the Minister doth <hi>publish,</hi> or pronounce it: to which <hi>Act</hi> of the Minister, God by <hi>promise</hi> adds the assistance of his <hi>persuading Spirit,</hi> and so the Sinner becomes <hi>certain</hi> of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of his Sin. In this sense therefore it is true, that we are first loosed on earth, and then in Heaven, because that after the Ministerial Absolution pronounced here on earth, our Consciences do by the Spirit obtain an <hi>undoubted</hi>

And of this Confession to the Minister I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted somewhat the more largely, because, indeed to be, as my Text speaketh, <hi>once purged of sinne,</hi> and yet to have a conscience not duly sensible of this benefit, I mean the benefit of Absolution, by the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Ministry, is but with those blinded <hi>Anamites,</hi> to be in the

               <p>For as in the eyes of that All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing Majestie, a <hi>Thousand years are but as one day,</hi> so are as many <hi>generations</hi> but as <hi>one man.</hi> Now in a <hi>single offender,</hi> 'tis mercy that expects repentance a long time, though for neglecting it, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment be infflicted afterward with greater severity. So is it in respect of <hi>whole Nations;</hi> 'tis the goodnesse of God, that through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out so many ages attends their conversion; yet must that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome dread the more fearfull ruin, which hath enlarged her transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions by perpetuity.</p>

                  <hi>Amalek</hi> rebelled in the time of <hi>Moses,</hi> and was then threatned with eternall hatred, as appears <hi>Exodus</hi> 17th. at the 14th. verse; but succeeding ages, and the sinnes of <hi>Amaleks</hi> posterity, brought down that horrour of punishment, of which <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 14. was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to be <hi>Executioner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor was posterity then punisht for the Fathers sinne alone; for as 'tis evident, <hi>Amalek</hi> still main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained enmity against <hi>Israel,</hi> the people of God: whereas had they from a conscience of their Fathers sinne, sued out pardon for those first offences, probably the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment had not been of so high a nature, where the transgression should have been found of lesse continuance.</p>
               <p>Neither may this conscience of sinne past, arise onely from a fear of <hi>Temporal</hi> afflictions. No: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:102511:86"/>
and Frail men that we are, we may be again and again perplexed with the guilt of those very transgressions, which we once thought and verily perswaded our selves were forgiven.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>infant-issue</hi> must needs faint, when the <hi>Mother</hi> languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; and when our <hi>Faith</hi> is so mix'd with <hi>doubting,</hi> our <hi>joy</hi> must needs be subject to much <hi>inconstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;</hi> and if in the case of eternal salvation it self, our <hi>confidence</hi> may be buffetted sometimes with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <hi>fears,</hi> and almost degenerate into <hi>despair;</hi> much more, as to the matter onely of <hi>Forgivenesse</hi> of sin, may our <hi>peace</hi> be again mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lested with <hi>perplexity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the 51th. <hi>Psalm,</hi> while <hi>David</hi> entreats pardon of God for that complicate sin, which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, in the case of <hi>Bathshebah</hi> and <hi>Vriah,</hi> that is, murthering the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:102511:87"/>
Husband, and defiling the Wife, see, he becomes burthened on the sudden with the conscience of all his former transgressions; there he makes confession of his <hi>original guilt,</hi> and humbly entreats par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for all his <hi>Actual offences. Dele omnes iniquitates meas,</hi> saith he, at the 10th. verse. <hi>Lord blot out all mine iniquities</hi> whatsoever, and at the 12th. <hi>redde mihi laetitiam,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>O give me the comfort of thy help again,</hi> and <hi>Stablish me with thy free Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if a <hi>justified man</hi> may not be again troubled with a conscience of sins past, whence came that prayer of this same Prophet, <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>s.</hi> 25th. at the 6. verse, <hi>Remember not, O Lord, the sinnes of my youth?</hi> shall we think <hi>David</hi> so carelesse, as not to have long before this time, entreated pardon for his youthfull transgressions? or that
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:102511:87"/>
God himself so little regarded his prayer, <hi>whom his very soul loved,</hi> as that though he had begg'd, yet he had not obtained pardon for them? no doubt he had of a long time felt <hi>good assurance,</hi> and a sensible Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, that such his sinnes were forgiven him: and yet upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of those many miseries, which befell him from <hi>Sauls</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and <hi>Doegs</hi> treachery, he groans again under the former burthen, and begins to accuse the sins of his youth, as <hi>cause,</hi> that his riper years were expos'd to such afflictions.</p>
               <p>But what? do you say a man <hi>once purg'd</hi> may be so many waies burthened again with a consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of sinne? may his past offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces again, after purgation, after his being <hi>justified</hi> and acquitted from them <hi>by the blood of Christ,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright him with fear, sometimes
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:102511:88"/>
of Temporal, sometimes of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal punishment? where's then the Truth of my Apostles Doctrine, <hi>worshippers once purg'd, have no more conscience of sin?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To answer you briefly, it holds in these two senses. First and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely in respect of that consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of sinne, which we called <hi>ex parte victimae,</hi> they that are once purg'd <hi>in the blood of the lamb,</hi> do not with those <hi>Hebrews,</hi> which my Apostle deals with in the Text, again thirst after any <hi>further sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;</hi> but their consciences rest <hi>fully assured,</hi> that all sinnes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever may be <hi>perfectly</hi> done away by Christs <hi>one</hi> and great <hi>obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, it may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood also in some sense, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of that <hi>conscience</hi> of sinne, which we called <hi>ex parte reatus;</hi> but not so absolutely here, as in
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:102511:88"/>
the other; because not <hi>at all times,</hi> nor upon <hi>all occasions.</hi> For the Saints have many fallings; there is no man living, that sinneth not, even the <hi>just</hi> man himself, as the Scripture speaketh, <hi>falleth,</hi> that is, sinneth, more or lesse grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously, <hi>seven times a day,</hi> and by consequence wounds and loads his conscience with <hi>the guilt</hi> of sinne: however, it is certain, that at some times also the true servants of God, men truely <hi>justified</hi> and regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, have their hearts so <hi>sprinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the blood of Christ</hi> by faith, and are so united with God by a <hi>full assurance</hi> of the forgivenesse of sin, and sense of Gods love and favour towards them, that they have no <hi>conscience,</hi> that is, no sense, no fear <hi>of guilt</hi> at all for any of their offences whatsoever. For as they are at some <hi>special</hi> times <hi>assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> of their salvation, so are they
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:102511:89"/>
likewise, in the same hours of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, assured of the <hi>remission</hi> of all sin.</p>
               <p>Fear not then thou fainting Christian, fear not, nor be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maied, although thy tender and timorous conscience affrights thee sometimes perhaps, with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, even of those trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions, whose pardon thou hast heretosore, upon sure grounds, no way distrusted; be not much troubled at them, seeing thou hast the remedy almost in thine own hands. Whensoever thou findest them thus to return upon thee, distracting thy thoughts, and disturbing thy repose, cast thy self upon God, confesse them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, wash them both in the blood of Christ by Faith, and in thine own tears, by contrition and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty sorrow: so shall thy good God, who doubtlesse upon thy first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:102511:89"/>
did truely remit and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them unto thee, upon thy se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond confession and tears, make thee become a second time, and much more, <hi>certain</hi> of thy <hi>absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I say <hi>confesse</hi> them again. For although the <hi>Iesuite, Salmeron</hi> I mean, be pleased to give us such an observation as this in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries upon this chapter, <hi>ad iterandas confessiones nullâ lege arcta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur aut Evangelicâ aut Apostolicâ.</hi> Theres no Law ties us to make often confession of the same sinne, <hi>viz.</hi> which we have once already duly confessed; yet though <hi>lawes</hi> be silent, I think, I have shewed examples, namely of that <hi>man after Gods own heart,</hi> that royal penitent and Prophet King <hi>David<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> of the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse others that might be alleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; which although they tye not

                  </gap>e, perhaps, as to a matter of Faith or Divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, as the <hi>Iesuite</hi> pretends, yet I suppose, their bare practice deserves our Imitation better, and is more safely followed, than his opinion, especially in ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>es of <hi>great</hi> distresse, and where <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial</hi> comfort is necessary to qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et and allay the <hi>Agony</hi> of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
               <p>But I shall not enter into sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther controversie with him. God, who <hi>comforteth Hierusalem,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort <hi>the mourners that are in Israel:</hi> comfort all such as groan under the <hi>conscience</hi> and <hi>guilt</hi> of sin<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne; restore <hi>True peace</hi> unto their souls; give them all <hi>necessary</hi> and <hi>full assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> of the remission of their sins here, through Faith in the blood of Christ, and afterwards advance them to Glory, and to the Fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of those <hi>comforts,</hi> which shall

never fail, by the same Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Holy Ghost, three Persons, one Eternal, Almighty, and most merciful God, be all Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Adoration given of all creatures now and for ever,</p>
