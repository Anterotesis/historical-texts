            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>VOuchsafe (<hi>GREAT LORDS</hi>) with patience for to hear</l>
               <l>Our just request, which we present you here.</l>
               <l>'Tis said abroad that you the Church would free</l>
               <l>Of sundry faults, which in the same there be.</l>
               <l>But that it's feard, and you perhaps conceive</l>
               <l>A change of things, we Priests will not receive.</l>
               <l>But will stand out for things we former had:</l>
               <l>And doe them still, though you shall thinke them bad.</l>
               <l>But we doe hope, by this to make it cleare,</l>
               <l>That no such thing of us, you need to feare.</l>
               <l>For we (like <hi>Scots</hi>) will not such things put by</l>
               <l>As are impos'd by Soveraigne Majesty.</l>
               <l>Nor are we like the <hi>Puritanish</hi> Sects,</l>
               <l>Who'll doe no more than what the Word directs.</l>
               <l>We never yet have shew'd our selves so ill,</l>
               <l>But what the State enjoyn'd we did it still.</l>
               <l>And that your Honours may be sure of this,</l>
               <l>We can produce the ages past for us.</l>
               <l>You know King <hi>Edward</hi> did the Masse put downe,</l>
               <l>And set the Service Booke up in the roome.</l>
               <l>We then the Clergy of the Land throughout,</l>
               <l>Forsooke the old and tooke the newer up.</l>
               <l>When he was dead, and <hi>Mary</hi> had the Crowne,</l>
               <l>Then up goes Masse, and Service it comes downe.</l>
               <l>Yet we Sir Priests as men of quiet spirits,</l>
               <l>Obey'd the Prince, and turn'd unto our vomits.</l>
               <l>Some few yeares after <hi>Mary</hi> being dead,</l>
               <l>The Crowne is set upon her <hi>Sisters</hi> head.</l>
               <l>Now shee againe puts downe the Idoll Masse,</l>
               <l>And hath the Service, as before it was.</l>
               <l>To this our Father Priests did then submit,</l>
               <l>Though most perhaps did minde it was not fit:</l>
               <l>Yet what the State did thinke for to be best,</l>
               <l>They question not, but do't, and therein rest.</l>
               <l>What they have done, we meane the like to doe;</l>
               <l>Conforme our selves, to things confirm'd by you.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:29433:3"/>If you put downe our Bishops from their Chaire:</l>
               <l>Their Liturgie, and Courts, and other geere.</l>
               <l>What next by you shall be enacted then,</l>
               <l>Shall be observ'd by us the Clergie men?</l>
               <l>But if you please to have them yet stand still,</l>
               <l>We are content, and yeeld to them we will.</l>
               <l>For government and worship, what care we,</l>
               <l>Or Rites, and Orders what in Church there be,</l>
               <l>Our care is onely, for to keep from wants:</l>
               <l>For Conscience here, we leave to Puritants.</l>
               <l>And this we judge to be no wise mans case,</l>
               <l>To deeme his Conscience better than his place.</l>
               <l>The Canons late which were on us impos'd,</l>
               <l>By you are thought not fit for to be us'd.</l>
               <l>Yet we (Sir Priests) did stand so much in aw,</l>
               <l>As that we meant to yeeld unto their Law:</l>
               <l>And ere that we will leave our gainfull trade,</l>
               <l>We'll stoop to all what ere by man is made.</l>
               <l>Therefore brave Lords, as you in Court now sit:</l>
               <l>So let Religion be, as you thinke fit,</l>
               <l>We take no thought this way about Gods will,</l>
               <l>But how to keepe our Benefices still.</l>
               <l>And hope we doe, although the better part,</l>
               <l>To cast us out can finde it in their heart.</l>
               <l>Yet there are some, will speake for poore Sir <hi>Johns:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>For lazy Dogs, old Priests, and idle Drones.</l>
               <l>For pluralists, non-res'dents, and such men;</l>
               <l>The <hi>Clergy</hi> now consisting most of them,</l>
               <l>And cause there is, the matter should be so:</l>
               <l>For if turn'd out (alas) what shall we doe.</l>
               <l>It's now so long, since we forsooke the trade</l>
               <l>Of cobling, weaving, thatching, and the spade,</l>
               <l>That for to worke our bodies are unfit;</l>
               <l>Nor can We bring our hearts at all to it.</l>
               <l>If we therefore must let our Priest-hood fall,</l>
               <l>This then we beg most humbly of you all.</l>
               <l>That still we may enjoy our belly cheare:</l>
               <l>And idly live, without all worke or care:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:29433:3"/>And if your honours will but grant us this,</l>
               <l>We are content, if you will us dismisse.</l>
               <l>For we came to the place for Conscience sake,</l>
               <l>As to be fed, and labour none to take.</l>
               <l>But yet we thinke, much better it will be,</l>
               <l>That in the <hi>Priest-hood</hi> left alone be wee.</l>
               <l>For if the <hi>Puritaines,</hi> the onely men,</l>
               <l>Who wish us out, so that they may come in.</l>
               <l>Doe get but once, into our place and roome,</l>
               <l>They will not doe as we (poore fooles) have done:</l>
               <l>They are (forsooth) so scruplous in their wayes,</l>
               <l>That if it be against Gods holy Lawes,</l>
               <l>They will not doe it, no although it be</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>A</hi> thing required of his Majestie:</l>
               <l>But as for us our carriage is not so,</l>
               <l>If State command we never say it no.</l>
               <l>And this we dare affirme there is no where</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>A</hi> more Time-serving Clergy than is here.</l>
               <l>When our sweet Bishops had by Act obtain'd,</l>
               <l>To have Gods holy day with sports profan'd.</l>
               <l>Although the purer sort against it taught:</l>
               <l>Yet we conform'd, although we knew 'twas naught.</l>
               <l>What ever <hi>Laud</hi> devis'd, and on us cast,</l>
               <l>We did the same to hold our livings fast:</l>
               <l>And we fore-saw what further was his hope,</l>
               <l>To bring us all in service to the <hi>Pope.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Which thing, if he had once but brought to passe,</l>
               <l>To yeeld thereto our full intentment was.</l>
               <l>And thus we have your Honours made to see,</l>
               <l>VVhy in the <hi>Priest-hood</hi> we should suffered be.</l>
               <l>Namely for this, and nothing else at all,</l>
