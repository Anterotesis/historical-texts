            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>VHereas We have lately ſeen a Vow or Covenant pretended to be taken by ſome Members of both Houſes of Parliament, whereby after the taking notice of a Popiſh and Traiterous Plot for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the true Reformed Proteſtant Religion, and the Liberty of the Subject, and to ſurprize the Cities of London and Weſtminſter, They doe promiſe and covenant, according to their utmoſt power, to aſſiſt the Forces pretended to be raiſed and continued by both Houſes of Parliament, againſt the Forces raiſed by Us, and to aſſiſt all other Perſons that ſhall take the ſaid Oath, in what they ſhall doe in purſuance thereof; Which Oath as the ſame hath been taken without the leaſt colour or ground, the contrivers thereof well knowing that there is no Popiſh Army within this Kingdom, that We are ſo far from giving countenance to that Religion, that We have alwayes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and always offered Our conſent to any Act for the ſuppreſſion of Popery and the growth thereof; and that the Army raiſed by Us is in truth for the neceſſary defence of the true Reformed Proteſtant Religion eſtabliſhed by Law, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and Property of the Subject, and Our own juſt Rights according to Law, all which being ſetled and ſubmitted to, or ſuch a free and peaceable convention in Parliament being provided for, that the ſame might be ſetled, We have offered and are ſtill ready to disband Our Armies; and as the ſaid Oath was deviſed only to prevent Peace, and to preengage the Votes of the Members of both Houſes (directly contrary to the Freedom and Liberty of Parliament) &amp; to engage them and Our good Subjects in the maintenance of this horrid and odious Rebellion; ſo it is directly contrary, as well to their naturall Duty as to the Oaths of Allegiance &amp; Supremacie eſtabliſhed by Law, which obliges them to bear to Vs Truth and Faith of Life, Members and Earthly Honour, and to defend Us to the utmoſt of their powers againſt all conſpiracies and attempts whatſoever, which ſhall be made againſt Our Perſon, Our Crown and Dignity, and to do their beſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to diſcloſe and make known to Us all Treaſons and Traiterous Conſpiracies which ſhall be againſt Us, and to their power to aſſiſt and defend all Juriſdictions, Priviledges, Preheminences, and Authority belonging to Us, or united and annexed to the Imperiall Crowne of this Realme.
