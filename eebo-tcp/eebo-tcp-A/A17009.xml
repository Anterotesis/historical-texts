         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of <hi>Moſes</hi> (Right Honorable)
concerning <hi>Melchiſedek Gen.</hi> 14
and the commaundement of
conſideryng howe great the

take place in our hartes, vnleſſe
the perſon be knowen: that
all ſpoken of hym may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in due ſenſe. For eyther we ſhall clymbe three
ſteppes too hygh with <hi>Melchiſedekians, Hierax,</hi> or yet
<hi>Origen,</hi> who make hym more then a mortall wight: or
we ſhall fall too low, with the common <hi>Greekes,</hi> who
make hym eyther a <hi>Chanaanite,</hi> or leaue hym to be an
obſcure man. But when we find out certaynely who the
perſon is, then we may ſafely examine all that is ſpoken
of hym. And in my opinion, that which is written of
hym, reacheth ſo farre both to the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> one way,
and to the ſeconde <hi>Adam</hi> an other way, ſtyll ouerſhy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng
<hi>Aarons</hi> ceremonies: that an errour in this matter
wyll no leſſe frette the webbe of holy Story, then the
worke of a VVeauer is hurt, when many thriddes in
<pb facs="tcp:6168:3"/>
one place are pulde away, which reached through the
whole peece. In a matter of this weight, I iudged my
labours ſhoulde be well ſpent, that I myght both ſhake
off quite, from all myndes which vſe my paynes, that
which is to be reiected: and helpe to ſettle better the
ancient trueth. To that ende I handle the chiefe diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie
that haue been touching <hi>Melchiſedek:</hi> and ſpeake
for one opinion more at large: which <hi>Hebrewes</hi> alwayes
helde, and <hi>Latines</hi> moſt commonly: that <hi>Sem</hi> the father
of all the ſonnes of <hi>Heber,</hi> muſt needes be the man.
Whereas many and great men thought otheryſe: but
neyther the moſt ancient, nor the moſt part, nor onely
of the beſt: I leaue all to the Reader to iudge: who, yf
he be of Learnyng wyll eyther (as I truſt) folow the ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
opinion continued ſtyll, or without blame geue
others leaue to folow it. In choſing a particuler Iudge,
I finde your Lordſhyp, meete to geue a right cenſure in
difficulties: and I ſuppoſe you wyll delyght to heare
what antiquity ſpeaketh, and the matter it ſelfe in this
cauſe. You ſhall finde this matter muche lyke that,
wherein once your L. beſtowed long tyme in ſpeach
with me: and many of the very ſame poyntes (though
to an other concluſion) wyll here offer them ſelues.
As the other, in my mynde, were of profite to be kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen:
ſo by theſe I truſt, the ſtudent in Diuinitie wyll
thinke hym ſelfe ſomewhat holpen. And that both may
come togeather, yf it be not a trouble to your leaſure to
remember, it wylbe a benefite to Scholers for to marke
how ſome Counſellers looke into theyr ſtudies, and
teach by ſodayne demaundes what poyntes experience
of whole kingdomes require to be playnely taught in
the worlde: which the common ſort lytle thynke of:
and for want of indgement raſhly diſpiſe. Fiue yeeres
ago your L. requeſted me to repayre to the Court, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernyng
the <hi>Greeke</hi> tranſlation of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Prophetes
<pb facs="tcp:6168:3"/>
preſented to you, and concernyng peruſing of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſh:
to haue more integrity and playnneſſe accordyng
to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and the Apoſtles <hi>Greeke.</hi> Then you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
moſt wyllingly three houres ſpech for matters
of chiefe and generall vſe, and of great hardneſſe: in ſuch
ſort that I was amazed how you ſhoulde haue eyther
ſuch leyſure, to be ready in them, from your politicall
affayres and ſtudies, or ſo right and profounde a iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the bones in the body of Scripture, as Diuines
ſkant thinke of, tyll great errours driue them to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
Beginnyng from the <hi>Greeke,</hi> you demaunded why
the 70. ſhould not be more accompted then the <hi>Hebrew,</hi>
ſeeing the Apoſtles folow it: Reaſon beyng rendred,
that they were to folow it, becauſe Heathen commonly
knew no other Bible. You further examined how farre
they folowed, and in eache kinde tryed out the matter.
Their ſtrangeneſſe of imitation was, in that they refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
not bare faultes of Grammer, as often appeareth: to
teach vs not to fight for wordes: Secondly, they folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
the 70. where they hid their mynde, as in <hi>Kenan,
Gen.</hi> 11. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 3. and in Seuentie and fiue ſoules, for Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

which often they do. Thirdly, in ſome rare vſe of
a worde. One example of that offered it ſelfe. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.
which myſtaken by Tranſlaters, putteth all men to a
plundge. For it is ſayd: No further offeryng remayneth

Of <hi>Melchiſedek</hi> ſpeaketh the Apoſtle in the ſame place,
<hi>that he likened to the Sonne of God, continueth a Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer

he is not equall to the ſonne of God: For how can the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant

That <hi>Epiphanius</hi> proueth afterwardes. And that, <hi>VVith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

that ſtretch it further: as though the holy Ghoſt had ſayde,
in all the Scripture, a father or mother for him can not be
founde. So they might as wel ſay, that by al the Scripture
it coulde not be proued, that he had beginning of dayes, and
ende of lyfe. Whereas the Apoſtle expreſly teacheth, <hi>That
it is ordeyned, that all men once ſhall die.</hi> Now of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedek</hi>
it is as wel<note n="‡" place="margin">Heb. 7. Gene. 3.</note> affyrmed, <hi>that he lyueth:</hi> as that <hi>he
is without father and mother.</hi> But by the Scripture we
may gather, <hi>that he dyed:</hi> therefore as well, <hi>that he had fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            <p>Let none thinke, that the ſpirite of God is controlled, by
ſeeking his name and parentage. <hi>Iob</hi> woulde tell vs, that
it is not good to defend Gods cauſe with an errour,<note place="margin">Iob. 13. 7.</note> (<hi>preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

For it is not ſpoken ſimply, but in relation. And euery
<note n="♐" place="margin">By S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtnes leaue.</note> wyſe man wyl graunt, that he had both father and mother.
And why ſhoulde the Figure be more defaced, by a certayne
<pb facs="tcp:6168:6"/>
father taught vs, by ſundry argumentes, by <hi>Moſes</hi> when he
wrote, then by obſcure fathers? The Apoſtle diſputeth of
<hi>Melchiſedekes</hi> caſe, as in <hi>Abrahams</hi> tyme he was knowen,
when he was alyue, and actually a figure of Chriſt, not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng
with that certayntie, whiche is euident ſince <hi>Moſes</hi>
wrote a Comment vpon that caſe, ſhewyng what man was
then alyue, at <hi>Salem</hi> greater then <hi>Abraham.</hi> And without

this:<note place="margin">Heb. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Of him we haue many thinges to be ſpoken, hard

the Apoſtle, and marke his wordes: and know both the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſilence, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. and his vndoubted proper
meaning from <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.<note place="margin">Gen. 14. 18.</note> what man he muſt needes be, who
then was king of <hi>Salem.</hi> It is a frowarde modeſtie, which
wyll not ſearch when God biddeth: and the ſtopping of the
eares, is Serpentlike: when God blameth for dulnes of
hearing.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle (in deede) from the ſilence of <hi>Moſes</hi> teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that he was a figure of the Meſſias. But how large
may we expounde his ſilence, to be ouer his whole lawe,
or in the phraſe touching <hi>Melchiſedek?</hi> Doubtles touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the open and preſent ſtory of <hi>Melchiſedek.</hi> For to
whom doth he teſtifie that? but to the <hi>Hebrwees:</hi> which ſo
holde it vnto this day, as the Apoſtles ſpeach doth handle it:
who both conſider the Figure repreſenting one more then a
man, &amp; alſo can playnely proue, in hiſtorical kinde, by <hi>Moſes</hi>
from other places, who helde <hi>Salem</hi> then: and who then
alyue might be holden greater then <hi>Abraham:</hi> whereby it
might well be knowen, what perticular perſon, both the
Apoſtle meant, and the Hebrewes knewe to be ſpoken of.
And why then ſhoulde men draw the matter otherwyſe then
euer the Hebrewes woulde ſuffer it to be drawen? <hi>Sickerles</hi>
the Apoſtle woulde reaſon, as the Iewes might vnderſtand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and neuer woulde his argument, which muſt be playne,
<pb facs="tcp:6168:7"/>
bring more entanglementes then all religion had. But the
Iewes ſhoulde haue been more entangled by a doctrine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
any then alyue greater then <hi>Abraham,</hi> but ſuch as had
the promiſe of Chriſt before. Therefore the Apoſtle would
neuer go about, to thruſt an opinion vpon them: for one
greater then <hi>Abraham,</hi> but woulde talke accordyng to their
meanyng. Let none thereon frame a godlyer modeſty vnto
him ſelfe, then the whole ſway of Hebrewes, touching an
Hebrew poynt, wil ſuffer: and the Apoſtle writing to them:
expounded by their continuall iudgement. Neyther let any
euer thinke, that God would forbid ſearching of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
for a matter of ſtorie: as the kinred of a man is: but
rather charge vs to marke al poyntes, the firſt and the later:
that in all, Gods playne conſtancie of bleſſing myght ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
in a man: whom wicked <hi>Canaan</hi> knew to be glorious,
but no more regarded his ſtate, or knew his kinred, byrth,
or death: then yf he had them not at all: Yet might haue
knowen, yf their Fathers had delyuered the memorie of
<hi>Noes</hi> bleſſing from age to age vntyll theyr tyme: and had
taught them who dwelt at <hi>Salem,</hi> borne before the worlde
now,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 3, 7.</note> not of their kinred: nor lyke to ende his lyfe in theyr
dayes, by reaſon of luſty ſtrength. An higher poynt <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedek</hi>
reſembled,<note place="margin">Conferre Gen. 9. &amp; 11. &amp; 14.</note> to which the proper* ſtorie woulde
bring by degrees: whiche to knowe we are bounde.
The ignorance of that bred the <hi>Melchiſedekians:</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing
of them, I truſt, ſhall not be needefull in this age, but
ſo farre as men ſomewhat touch them, in miſtaking the
ſpech: <hi>without father, without mother. &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>2 There ſprang another opinion that was ſomwhat hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of ſome olde Latines,<note place="margin">The seconde opinion.</note> otherwyſe the beſt learned: But
<hi>Epiphanius</hi> fathereth it vpon <hi>Hierax,</hi> which taught earneſtly
that <hi>Melchiſedek</hi> was the holy Ghoſt, becauſe he was tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to be lykened to the Sonne of God: and applyeth theſe
wordes, <hi>Abydeth a Sacrificer continually,</hi> to that which
<pb facs="tcp:6168:7"/>

               </note> 
               <hi>The ſpirite maketh interceſſion with
groninges vnſpeakable.</hi> But <hi>Hierax</hi> hath miſt extreamely.
For the Holy ſpirite neuer tooke fleſh: Wherefore he coulde
not be a king of <hi>Salem,</hi> and a ſacrificer of one certaine place:
For, <hi>euery</hi> (high) <hi>Sacrificer is taken from men.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 5. 1.</note> Some
pardon muſt be geuen to them that helde this errour, more
then to the former: by reaſon that of two other opinions,
which haue had ſome ſtroke: neyther coulde greatly pleaſe
the Grekes Vntyll this day, as ſhal appeare by the diſcourſe.
Alſo amongſt the Latines <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> was a mighty wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> defence of <hi>Hierax</hi> minde, ſtyrred Vp by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fondnes of
that one opinion, which Greekes ſomwhat liked of,<note n="‡" place="margin">That Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedeck was a Cananite by kinred. Epiph. in Here. 55. oecum. vpon Heb. 7.</note> either
not knowing, or not conſidering cleerely the Chronicle and
ſtorie fortifiyng the other. Theſe two opinions agree in one
poynt, that <hi>Melchiſedek</hi> was a king of a ſmal kingdome in
<hi>Chanaan:</hi> Or as one tranſlateth <hi>Tremelius,</hi> (a lytle<note n="§" place="margin">That he was no farther a Chananite then by place.</note> Chana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anite

<hi>The ſpeech of Chanaan:</hi> ſo any one dwelling there, might
as well be of <hi>Tremelius</hi> called <hi>Chananeus.</hi> Now by both
ſides, who holde this opinion, <hi>Melchiſedek</hi> cannot be any
ſpirite: but one that hath <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noe</hi> to his father,
and doubteles to his mother <hi>Eue</hi> namely: and had both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning

thy mother, and thy countrey, and thou art come to a
people which thou didſt not know before. The Lorde
wyll recompence thee: and thy rewarde ſhalbe perfect
from the Lord.</hi> It is manifeſt by this Text, that after his
fathers death, God remooued his dwelling from <hi>Charan,</hi>
as <hi>S. Stephen</hi> expoundeth it. And <hi>Philo</hi> the Greeke writer
in <hi>Abrahams</hi> Peregrination expreſſely noteth that to be
the common iudgement of the <hi>Iewes</hi> of this tyme. This
he writeth. It is lyke that none is ignorant that haue read
the Lawes, how <hi>Abraham</hi> firſt remouing his dwelling fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <hi>Chaldea</hi> dwelt in <hi>Charan.</hi> And after that his father dyed
there, he remooueth alſo from it. And in the ſame worke
alſo he ſayth, that <hi>Abraham</hi> left <hi>Charan,</hi> being ſeuentie
and fiue yeeres olde. I am perſwaded, that of olde time
the <hi>Greekes</hi> were of <hi>Philoes</hi> iudgement. Yet of later
times two opinions haue been much holden: which I
cannot allow off. The one, that <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhoulde be borne
when <hi>Terah</hi> was ſeuentie yeeres olde, as he is fyrſt in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
the other, that the Promiſe vpon the former wordes
was geuen in <hi>Vr</hi> of <hi>Chaldea.</hi> The later <hi>Iewes</hi> holde both.
And alſo a<note n="*" place="margin">Becauſe ſaint <hi>Stephen</hi> for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> calling from <hi>Vr,</hi> vſed theſe wordes.

Stephens,</hi> cauſed many to holde the
later. <hi>Bucholcherus</hi> ſufficiently anſwereth that. Yet agaynſt
<hi>S Stephen,</hi> the former, the <hi>Iewes</hi> holde for ſome rancor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:6168:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he ſayth, that after <hi>Terahs</hi> death, God remooued
<hi>Abrahams</hi> to <hi>Charan.</hi> Nothing but rancor coulde thruſt
them into that opinion, agaynſt expreſſed wordes, and their
owne knowledge. They knewe well enough that the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of their names no more made <hi>Abraham</hi> eldeſt, then it
coulde make <hi>Sem</hi> eldeſt: whom the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> and moſt
<hi>Rabbines</hi> holde to be younger then <hi>Iapheth.</hi> Moreouer,
they holde <hi>Sarah,</hi> who was but ten yeeres younger then
<hi>Abraham,</hi> to be <hi>Harans</hi> daughter. <hi>Genebardus</hi> lyketh well
of this, that <hi>Haran</hi> at eight yeeres of age ſhoulde beget her.
But the <hi>Iewes</hi> rather woulde thinke that he vnderſtoode
not their dalliance: then holde that. An other reaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt
the <hi>Iewes</hi> is this: that they obſerue how <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of <hi>Terah</hi> onely, in that Chapter that he died:<note place="margin">R. Bochai <hi>vpon</hi> Gen. 11.</note> leaſt men
ſhoulde thinke that <hi>Abraham</hi> would leaue his Father aliue
behinde him. But he muſt be left ſixtie yeres behinde him,
yf <hi>Abraham</hi> were borne when <hi>Terah</hi> was ſeuentie: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Moſes</hi> by their grant would not haue men to thinke ſo.
An other reaſon agaynſt them is this: of the preſent caſe.
If <hi>Sem</hi> delyuered the bleſſing to <hi>Abraham, Abraham</hi> did
out liue him: for it coulde not be a propheticall worke to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer
the inheritaunce to one that ſhoulde not ſuruiue: and
he ſhould out lyue <hi>Abraham</hi> many yeeres, yf he were borne
in <hi>Terahs</hi> ſeuentith yeere. But they graunt that <hi>Sem</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
the bleſſing to <hi>Abraham:</hi> for they holde him to be
<hi>Melchiſedek:</hi> as witneſſeth <hi>Aruch</hi> in the worde <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi>
and whole troupes, whom I elſwhere cited. Therefore
<hi>Abraham</hi> out lyuing <hi>Sem,</hi> muſt be borne as <hi>Philo</hi> caſteth his
age: whereupon doubtles the Tranſlatours were moſt
mooued to alter the Text for yeeres. Now I wyll returne
to my diſputation for the other two opinions touchyng
<hi>Melchiſedek.</hi>
            </p>

might be a <hi>Chanaanite. <hi>Epiphanius</hi>
               </hi> woulde ſeeme to lyke
ſomewhat of this opinion, That <hi>Melchiſedeks</hi> father was
called <hi>Heraclas:</hi> a man of that countrey, dwelling at <hi>Salem:</hi>

they droue <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> to an other groſſe errour, while they
diſpute agaynſt <hi>Samaritans</hi> onely, as though ſome <hi>Iewes</hi>
had thought otherwyſe. In deede <hi>Epiphanius</hi> dealing is
ſtrange. He being a Chriſtian from <hi>Palaſtina,</hi> and a <hi>Iew,</hi> as
<hi>Iohn</hi> byſhop of <hi>Nicea</hi> recordeth,<note n="*" place="margin">In an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely not yet printed, but to be ſeene in Emmanuell colldege in Cambridge: with Planudes, who condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth Purgatory playnly, yet wrote about the yere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1100.</note> durſt not openly deny the

was but about fiue hundreth and thirtie, when <hi>Abraham</hi>

            <p>Conſider an other poynt what y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Apoſtle meaneth, when
he ſaith of <hi>Melchiſedek</hi> ſtrangely: he is by teſtimony faid to
liue ſtyl. Although Learned men expounde it ſo, that the not
mentioning of his death, is the teſtimony of his lyuing ſtyl,
<pb facs="tcp:6168:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I dare not therein folow them, to call ſilence a teſtimony:
neyther can I thinke that the Apoſtle writing to men, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
deepe ſkill in learnyng, and ſkant his fauourers,
woulde vſe any worde that might not abide tryall of the
aduerſaries. Now I holde that the <hi>Hebrewe</hi> wordes,
<hi>VE HV COHEN,</hi> that is, <hi>And he the ſame ſtyll
was ſacrificer,</hi> are vrged euen after <hi>Ben Iochais</hi> manner,
who was aliue when that the Apoſtles wrote, and amongſt
that nation. So in <hi>Zoar</hi> he the <hi>Rabbine</hi> expoundeth: <hi>AND
HE ſhall bruiſe the Serpentes head,</hi> to import the nature
euerlyuing. So properly <hi>Pſal</hi> 102. The worde <hi>HV,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth
GOD, who ſtill is the ſame: though the Heauens
change. Whoſe yeeres fayle not, though the heauens waxe
olde as doth a garment. In that ſort had I rather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde
the Apoſtle, by the Hebrew maner, then drawe him
to be a coyner of new phraſes. Whereas the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in 4640. wordes, and ſome more, hath not ſkant any
worde or phraſe but vſuall in that age: ſpecially it regarded
the <hi>Iewes</hi> maner of ſpeeches, and in euery booke floweth
with ſuch: which when we neglect, we wander. Now for
the Sacrificer in Heauen, whom <hi>Aaron</hi> on the earth reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.
The godly in that age made the ſpech ſo vſuall, that
the wicked graunt <hi>Michael</hi> (who is Chriſt the eternall An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
of the couenaunt) to be Sacrificer in the Heauens.

Which very ſame text the Apoſtle citeth, diſputing of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificer

            <p>And of later tymes, <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> ſayth vpon <hi>Pſal. 2. Kiſſe

that truſteth in that Sonne:</hi> that ſonne muſt needes be not

ſeeing they are not curſed, but happy, that truſt in him.
Wherefore ſeeing the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſpeake the ſame thinges that
the Apoſtles do, reaſon woulde that the Apoſtles ſpech lyke
theirs, and to them, and differing from all others, ſhoulde be

Therefore the Church of God was in that place, where

But whereas his poſterite were in <hi>Babylon, there by a lytle

Abraham from Babylon to Sem, the father of his anceſtours,

leaue ſome token behinde of our Chriſtian friendſhyp, and
agreement in Scripture: partly to ſhew his experience
how the teaching of this matter obſcurely, cauſed ſome to
blame the moſt part. He tolde of a Gentewoman that ſaid
thus to him: <hi>VVhy do the Preachers now teach, that

time they taught otherwiſe: for I haue ſeene an Englyſh
booke, founde in Douer Caſtle. 400. yeeres olde, that
affyrmeth <hi>Melchiſedek</hi> to be <hi>Sem</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Noah.</hi>
He marked offence geuen to the Matron in the chiefeſt

the phraſes for a type &amp; figure, taken from the deſcription
of <hi>Melchiſedek</hi> are not cleerely diſtinguiſhed, from that
which in ſtory from other Scriptures muſt be gathered.
To her he gaue a right erpoſition, in what ſenſe the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,

ſkilfull in the cauſe, myght vnderſtande what he woulde
haue to ſtade. For the firſt, thus I reaſon: Yf <hi>Epiphanius</hi>
leaneth in appearance vpon that which cuſtome helde, and
<pb facs="tcp:6168:23"/>
he knew to be moſt vntrue, he folowed cuſtome, and would
not ſimply be thought of that iudgement: but he is euident
in ſundry places to folow for cuſtome, that which was not
true: therfore he might alſo here be expounded to meane no
otherwyſe, then as a bearer with cuſtome, agaynſt propri
etie of trueth. One place prouing this kinde of dealyng,
and dallying, he hath. <hi>Page.</hi> 8. where from <hi>Adam</hi> to the

the <hi>Maſſorites</hi> miraculous diligence, for preſeruation of
euery letter in the Prophetes, how many they were in all:
which was the middle letter of all <hi>Moſes:</hi> which wordes

Now for Golde, yf he had loued it, he myght haue choſen

It is vſuall in all kinde of writers, to attribute the worke
vnto the narration. So Chriſt was crucified before the

tentes of olde tyme, as I haue touched before, their owne
wordes from a threefolde aucthoritie. And this their obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
is good to helpe them. For as the bleſſing was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
before <hi>Salem</hi> was aboliſhed, and the worde of the

<hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> being him ſelfe at great charges: but Chriſt

The <hi>Apoſtata</hi> woulde neuer haue been ſo mad, yf he had

They ſtyre warres for to recouer the low <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> to
weaken Princes, that their Cleargy myght afterwardes
haue Emperours and Kinges at their commaundement.
So the force of the Weſt, was ſent to the Eaſt: and there
the foure quarters of the earth made greater warres for the
Citie which had been once beloued, then the <hi>Seleucide</hi> and

<hi>Abraham</hi> was the ſonne of an Idolatrer once: but none
of <hi>Sems</hi> fathers worſhypped ſtrange Goddes. Alſo his lyfe
being without recorde of blemiſhe, he was fitteſt to vſe the
higheſt office. The other is a moſt high honour, that he
had fathers in order in ſuch honour: yet his two breathren
matched him in that. But with godlynes to winne the
prerogatiue from his elder brother, to haue the faythfull
diſcent, vntyll his God came in the fleſhe: this was an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable
glory: as that all the worlde ſhould looke vnto

So <hi>Sem,</hi> whom <hi>Chanaan</hi> ſhoulde ſerue, was to <hi>Chanaan</hi>
vnknowen, who was his father, or his mother: when was
the beginning of his dayes, or the ende of his life. The men

they woulde neyther commende them, nor keepe a recorde
of theyr owne: they neuer durſt reſiſt them. For theſe
poyntes whereupon the Scripture to vs ſeemeth ſealed
with ſeauen ſeales, for want of dayly readyng, wherein
we ſhould be occupied: The Nation moſt cunnyng in theſe
poyntes, touchyng the open phraſe, ſhoulde not be blamed:
but for the cloſe lyfe ſkattered through all theſe ſayinges,
the Scripture blameth for dulneſſe of hearyng touchyng
Chriſt, for his perſon and his office. For the whole worlde
by loſſe of Millions, dayly finde this a great ſecrete: how
<hi>God was manifeſted in the fleſhe, was iuſtified in the
ſpirite, was ſeene of Angelles, was preached in the world,
was beleeued of nations, was taken vp in glory.</hi> The
<hi>Turkes, Iewes,</hi> and all other Infidelles, they heare this: but
they heare theſe poyntes dully. Though in the two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande

and how they wyll confeſſe their ſinnes, and the ſinnes of

Couenant with <hi>Iacob, Iſaak,</hi> and <hi>Abraham:</hi> and that he
brought them out of the land of <hi>Egypt.</hi> This doth <hi>Moſes</hi>
tell. <hi>Daniel</hi> ſheweth the perfourmance. He when the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie
was ended, confeſſeth his ſinne, and the ſinne of his
Fathers, and that euery curſſe written by <hi>Moſes</hi> had taken
effect from the iuſt God: and notwithſtandyng that God
would remember how he brought his people from <hi>Egypt.</hi>
Hereupon God doth worke for vs woonderfull thynges.
He ſendeth an Angel to <hi>Daniel</hi> to teach him vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding:
who did ſo, as he him ſelfe recordeth for more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayntie,
that we ſhoulde take his wordes in that meanyng
as he him ſelfe tooke them, and not be wyſer then <hi>Daniel.</hi>
He calleth the Prophet that gaue God holy prayſe of iuſtice
and trueh, Delight it ſelfe, <hi>Chamudoth</hi> in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
that the worde came foorth at the beginnyng of his
prayer: (Now he prayed for returne to buylde <hi>Ieruſalem)
and from the outgoing of that worde, vnto Meſſias the
king moſt holy, brynging in Iuſtice eternal, to ende Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
to ſeale viſion and Prophet. 490. yeeres exactly
were pared out: and thereupon <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> ſhoulde be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</hi>
This he tolde: but who did looke ſo farre to the
ende of the Law?</p>
            <p>As <hi>Moſes</hi> face did ſhyne to ſuch as coulde looke vpon it:
ſo doth his doctrine ſhyne to ſuch as purſue the tenour of it.
Yet none can come to the ende of it, nor remoue the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng
from their hart: but ſuch as the Father doth turne
and draw vnto the Sonne. After the Lord had long taught,
lytle coulde men looke into the perſon of Chriſte. They

<hi>Peter</hi> doth confeſſe, <hi>that he was Chriſt the Sonne of the

by his death, that he did not vnderſtande. For when the
Lord ſayd: <hi>that he ſhoulde be killed, and ryſe agayne the

<hi>that he was the Sonne of God:</hi> they made that the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of his death. Moreouer when <hi>S. Stephen</hi> ſayd, That
Ieſus of Nazareth <hi>woulde deſtroy that place, and alter the
lawes that</hi> Moſes <hi>gaue:</hi> what had he then ſpoken more then

               <hi>Gabriel</hi> ſpake, <hi>That Chriſt woulde deſtroy Citie and

it is in <hi>Moſes</hi> ſayd, <hi>that his lawes ſhould continue Le Olam,
continually:</hi> It falleth out moſt fitly in this cauſe. For
<hi>Olam</hi> ſignifieth a Iubilee. Now Iubilees continued not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yonde
our Lord his death: but the laſt fell out in the ſame
yeere, that Holy yere, the acceptable time, when he brought
vs into our Reſt. For particuler declaration of that, an other
tyme muſt be taken, and for <hi>Moſes</hi> further meanyng, to be
opened. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preſent matter touching dulneſſe of hearing,
it was ſpoken doubtles of not vnderſtandyng <hi>Melchiſedek</hi>
repreſenting the Some of God: which repreſentation,
how woulde that Nation euer haue looked for in a <hi>Chana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anite,</hi>
whereas in <hi>Sem</hi> graunted by them to figuer Chriſt,
and in moſt manifeſt Scriptures, they woulde rather ſtop
their cares, then heare that poynt? Thus all that is ſpoken
of <hi>Melchiſedek,</hi> ſhineth in <hi>Sems</hi> cauſe: and it can not be,
that any other then alyue, ſhoulde be thought equall in the
kinde. <hi>Sem</hi> is the honour of Kinges, for antiquity, and
iuſtice: ended his dwelling at <hi>Salem,</hi> whence Religion
ſprang to our Fathers: was the worthieſt Sacrificer to
his God, was vnborne in the worlde now, vndead in the
memory of moſt that ſaw him bleſſe <hi>Abraham,</hi> undying in
deſcription of his age: beſides the maner of ſpech before
vſed, to the aſtonyſhment of men. <hi>Sem</hi> onely coulde tell
<hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaak,</hi> the ſtoryes of <hi>Adam,</hi> from the mouth
of <hi>Lamech</hi> and his father <hi>Methuſelah:</hi> onely by the <hi>lewes</hi>
graunt agaynſt the <hi>Iewes</hi> can be brought, a keeper of the
worlde from <hi>Tobu,</hi> by his owne eares teſtimony, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the law of Fayth before <hi>Abraham. Sem</hi> onely had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a promyſe, wherein the learned <hi>Iewes</hi> woulde be dull
of hearyng, and was meete to be lykened to the Sonne of
God in his caſe then. And neuer was any King more
ſtrengthened to a Kingdome by Warriers, then <hi>Sem</hi> is by
argumentes, to be <hi>Melchiſedek.</hi> This I had to ſpeake of
<pb facs="tcp:6168:43"/>
               <hi>Melchiſedek,</hi> ſtyred vp firſt to defence by ſpech of a Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

Afterwardes I wrote in fewe lynes the effect of all this,
ſufficient (as I ſuppoſed) to ſtay the vnſtayed: and ſo I
founde, that in many it tooke place. One Learned man
otherwayes mynded, wrote what he thought good to an
other concluſion. His, and myne, I willingly commende
to the iudgement of the Godly: that the trueth may take
place to common agreement, in buyldyng the kingdome of
Iuſtice in Peace.</p>
