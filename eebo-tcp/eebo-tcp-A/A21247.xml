            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </gap> I dare say) to shew him selfe either so foolish, that no wise man ought to beleeue him, or so false, that no honest man can credit him in none of all these matters heretofore reported by him. Remembring therfore, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in the ninetenth Article he tolde you, <hi>that all these matters came to him so credibly reported &amp;c.</hi> and spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king still of all, here he telleth you, <hi>that he hath not fully ynough reported them:</hi> in this, I say, marke you well, what he confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth against him selfe.</p>
               <p>If he haue not <hi>fully ynough reported the matters,</hi> that he hath spoken of: it must be graunted, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his reports of them do want some part requisite for a report, either in respect of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing reported, or in regarde of them, to whome the reporte is made.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:5755:100"/>
If the defect therefore be in respect of the persons, to whome he writeth: that is to saie, that his reportes are in such manner laid foorth, as are not fully ynough to make his Readers perceiue his meaning: then you see his grosse folie and lacke of witte, to vtter his mind fully ynough.</p>
               <p>If it be (as al mens writings are) ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ynough for some, but not fully ynough for al: then you see his grosser folie, that calleth this not fully ynough, whiche is fully ynough, as commonly any mannes writings are. For neuer man wrote so fully, ye wotte, as coulde satisfie euery man. If the defect be (as I plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it is, and you haue seene proued) in the nature of the thing it selfe: that is to saie, that his reportes doe lacke those ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary parts, that a report ought to haue, as truth &amp; certaintie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter reported, and a good warrant &amp; foundation for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter to speake vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: then may you see his fals<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Once graunted it is by himselfe, that fully ynough they are not reported: and a reporte neuer so brief, conteining truth, matter certeine, and hauing a lauful Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
<pb facs="tcp:5755:101"/>
is sufficient ynough for the common number of wise and honest men. For no man is bound further to enlarge his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, then truth &amp; certaintie doth require, nor to satisfie euery man.</p>
               <p>These wordes of his owne then, you see, do plainly conuince and conclude, that either these reports be al false, vncertaine, and ill grounded in more or in lesse, (and than plaieth he the very Dauie, to thinke and saie heere, that they are not yet fully ynough reported, which you haue seene proued to be to much by altogether) or els the very Sot, to cal that not fully ynough reported, that is fully ynough for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it is vttered for and euery way more than fully ynough, beeing false in euery parte.</p>
