            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

(falſly intituled, A true Remonſtrance of
the ſtate of the Salt buſineſſe, &amp;c.) lately
publiſhed in print in March, 1640. by the
Projectors of the firſt and ſecond Patents for
Salt, in their owne pretended defence, and
againſt the free trade of all Merchants, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigators,
and Traders for Fiſh and Salt of
the City of London, and all other Ports, and
of all Salt makers and Salt refiners, and of all
other his Majeſties Subjects within the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of their ſeverall Patents between Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke
and Weymouth, as followeth.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this Anſwer it will
not be neceſſary to bee
limited within the ſtrict
time where the Proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
began<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which was
in <hi>Anno.</hi> 1627. thereby
to ſerve their own occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
but is intended to declare the truth of
the moſt uſuall and conſtant prices of Salt at
the City of London, as it hath beene ſold for
40. yeares laſt paſt, as in the ſequell ſhall
appeare.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:42794:3"/>
That in <hi>Anno</hi> 1600. even till the latter part
of the yeare, 1627. the moſt uſuall price ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of white or bay Salt, was neare about
50. s. or 3. l. a Wey, and often ſold under
that price, as can be ſufficiently proved.</p>
            <p>That in the ſaid yeare 1627. the Warres
began betweene the Kings Majeſty of Great
Britaine, and the French King, and the King
of Spaine; in which time, till the peace was
concluded betwixt thoſe Kings, the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie
of Salt was very deare and ſcarce, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
French Salt, which was at 6. s. or 7. s.
a buſhell at the City of London, which came
to paſſe in regard the Salt-workes in France
were deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>Firſt, at the Ile of Ree by the Duke of
Buckinghams deſigne.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by the French King himſelfe in
the warres when he tooke in Rochel.</p>
            <p>And thirdly, by intemperate Raine which
fell that time in France. So that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of France it ſelfe, which was wont to
ſupply many other parts, as England, Ireland,
Holland, the Eaſtland, and Germany, was
thereby neceſſitated with want of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity
for its owne occaſion. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not to be admired, that the French King
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42794:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
made an Edict in <hi>Anno</hi> 1630. that no Salt
ſhould bee exported out of his Kingdome,
(untill his ſtore ſhould bee ſupplyed againe.)
Which ſcarcity in France for that preſent,
forced all men to ſend into Spaine for Salt,
and thereupon a great number of Ships from
all parts arriving there at one time, gave the
King of Spaine occaſion to make uſe of the
preſent neceſſity, and layd a great Impoſt on
the Salt that ſhould bee tranſported from
thence.</p>
            <p>The very ſame cauſe alſo moved the Kings
Majeſty of Great Britaine, and the Lords of
the Councell, to order in that time of ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of Salt, by meanes of a Petition exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Lords by the Lord Maior of the
City of London, and divers other Ports in
<hi>Anno</hi> 1630. that no Salt ſhould be tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into any forraigne parts, which was effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
granted them by the Lords. But
when in one or two yeares after, and that in
France there were erected Salt-workes, and
Salt was made plentifully againe, as in the
yeare 1632. then by the Edicts of the ſaid
Kings, the great impoſition of Salt in Spaine
and France ceaſed, and Salt became cheape
againe, and Trade free as in former yeares,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42794:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as about 3. l. or 3. li. 10. s. <hi>per</hi> Wey, for Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
or French, and 4. l. <hi>per</hi> Wey for Spaniſh
Salt at moſt, which continued till Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
1634.</p>
            <p>So that the cauſe of the dearth of Salt
in France, <hi>Anno</hi> 1628. till <hi>Anno</hi> 1632. hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
through Warre and intemperate Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as before is ſpecified, and not by the
pleaſure of Princes, by laying of a great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſt
upon it, as they the Patentees falſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended;
but the Projectors were deſirous
to make that an occaſion of bringing their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
deſires to effect, and about that time
they beganne to deviſe to bring an Impoſt
on the Engliſh native Salt, which was and is
dearer to the makers of it then any other ſalt
ſpent in this Kingdome. For French and
Spaniſh Salt being made onely by the heat of
the Sunne, ſtands not the makers of it in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
10. s. or 20. s. or 30. s. a London Wey
at the moſt, according to the drineſſe, or the
wetneſſe of the Summer, whereas the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Shields Salt at 1. d. <hi>per</hi> Gallon, (which is
the cheap price the Patentees boaſt of ſtands
the makers of it in 53. s. 4. s. the like Wey at
leaſt, being alſo the weakeſt Salt of all other
by one third part, and therefore cannot beare
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42794:4"/>
any Impoſt, without deſtroying the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
manufactures, as theſe Projectors have
all this time practiſed, to the deſtruction
thereof, although they pretended the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>It is to be obſerved, that a Wey of Salt at
the City of London, containeth 40. Buſhels,
and every Buſhell 10. Gallons, which is the
right meaſure according to the Statute; from
which, in moſt other Ports it much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.</p>
            <p>That in December, 1634. the firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors,
conſiſting of twenty two in number,
(whereof five were Knights, the other ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
had the titles of Eſquires and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men)
having determined and practiſed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
to doe miſchiefe in this Land wherein
they were borne and bred, and being all or
moſt of them unexperienced in the matter
they tooke in hand, deviſed and obtained
this Monopoly of Salt, miſ-informing his
Majeſty, and the Lords of the Councell, that
it would be a great benefit to this Kingdome
of England, and that of Scotland, to erect
workes for the making a ſufficient quantity
of Salt, &amp;c. and at a certaine moderate price,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42794:5"/>
(as they ſo termed it) not exceeding 3. l. a
Shields Wey, which is after the rate of 5. l.
12. s. for a Wey delivered at London, which
is an intolerable exaction upon a native ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture,
made and ſpent in this Kingdome,
as by their Patent more fully doth appeare;
(although the Salt pannes in thoſe places
were erected long before, and not by theſe
Patentees.) Which Patent being obtained
by them, they practiſed to oppreſſe the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
from January 1635. untill Auguſt 1638.
all which time the firſt Patentees having
made a Monopoly, in taking all the old
Workes and Pannes at the Shields into their
hands, forced white Salt at the City of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
to the price of 4. l. 15. s. <hi>per</hi> Wey, and
for the moſt part to 5. l. <hi>per</hi> Wey, and ſo in
all other Ports according to that rate.</p>
            <p>And Bay Salt, by reaſon of their great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſt
of 48. s. 6. d. <hi>per</hi> Wey, which was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by a privy Seale, procured by <hi>Edward
Nuttall,</hi> and others his aſſociates, (but nothing
brought to accompt for his Majeſty, as yet
appeares) was not all that time ſold at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
under 5. l. 10. s. <hi>per</hi> Wey, at leaſt, but
commonly at 5. l. 13. s. 4. d. <hi>per</hi> Wey, or 6. l.
whereas the Weſterne parts, which were free
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42794:5"/>
of their Patent, as Southampton, Exeter, Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,
Briſtol, &amp;c. had it in that time at or
about 3. l. the like Wey, and ſometimes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that price, which was moſt unjuſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall,
that the Eaſterne parts ſhould ſuffer
ſo much thereby, not onely in the price, but
alſo in hindrance of Navigation, and loſſe
of Trade.</p>
            <p>That about July, 1638. the firſt Patentees
having difference with Maſter <hi>Murford</hi> of
Yarmouth, who had a Patent granted before
theirs at Shields, prevailed againſt them, and
ſome of them of the firſt Patent being wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
with the deſigne, voluntarily laid downe
their Patent.</p>
            <p>That after the firſt Patentees gave over
their Patent, the Salt-makers at Shields in
Auguſt, 1638. reaſſumed their Pannes, and
ſold Salt there cheape againe, and thereby
both Scottiſh and Shields Salt was ſold at
London for 3. l. <hi>per</hi> Wey, or near thereabout,
untill January following, that <hi>Thomas Horth</hi>
and his aſſociates obtained a grant of their
Patent, which they preſently after put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
yet <hi>Horth</hi> and his aſſociates of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Patent had no time to raiſe the price of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42794:6"/>
white Salt at Shields to that height as they
deſired; for the Scots preſently after the firſt
Pacification in Auguſt, 1639. brought it
downe at London to 2. l. 17. s. <hi>per</hi> Wey,
whereas <hi>Horth</hi> and his Aſſociates in June and
July 1639. would ſell none at London under
4. l. 10. s. <hi>per</hi> Wey.</p>
            <p>That whereas the firſt and ſecond Proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
of both Patents, to cleare themſelves of
the great wrong done by them to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
and his Subjects, doe in their printed Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
lay the blame on the traders in Salt of
the City of London, ſeeking therby to gloſſe
over their oppreſſing the Subjects even in the
face of this Honourable Parliament, ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
as formerly, that what they did was
for his Majeſties profit, benefit of Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſupport of home manufacture, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
good of the ſubject, and many ſuch
like things, all which pretences are meere
falſhoods and ſuggeſtions.</p>
            <p>For firſt his Majeſties Revenew is no way
increaſed, as doth appeare by their payments
into his Majeſties Exchequer, being in all
but 700. l. whereas they have received Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſt,
and remaine debtors to his Majeſty ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42794:6"/>
thouſands, as by further examination and
proofe of their accompts will appeare.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Navigation hath beene much
hindred thereby, as by a former Petition of
the Trinity houſe to his Majeſty and the
Lords of the privy Councell appeareth, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
it hath beene ſufficiently proved before
the Committee for the Salt buſineſſe, by the
Maſter and Wardens of the Trinity Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
who are moſt ſenſible of the deſtruction
and advancement of the Shipping and Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of this Kingdome.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they have ſo cheriſhed the home
manufacture, by laying a heavy Impoſt upon
it, that thoſe that had 240. Pannes of their
own, and were thriving people at the Shields,
before their Patents were of force, and were
the makers there of Salt, are by the meanes
of theſe Patentees become ſo poore, that the
greater part of them are not able to buy coals
to ſet their Pannes on worke. And thoſe the
Patentees who bought 34. Pannes of the old
traders, did ceaſe working for the moſt part
of the yeares 1639. and 1640. by reaſon they
could not attaine to their intended price of
56. s. 8. d. <hi>per</hi> Wey at the Shields. So that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42794:7"/>
whereas there was formerly made at the
Shields before their Patents began about
16000. Wey <hi>per annum,</hi> they made in the
time of the firſt Patent, which continued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
three yeares and a halfe, not above
10000. Wey <hi>per annum.</hi> And in the time of
the latter Patent but 8000. Wey <hi>per annum,</hi>
even before the comming in of the Scottiſh
Army into thoſe parts: by all which appeares
how much they have deſtroyed the native
manufacture, and have no wayes advanced
or increaſed it, as they pretended.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, for their pretences of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
good of the Subject, in place whereof
they have ſo oppreſſed the Subject in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
that not onely the traders in Salt of the
City of London, have juſtly complained of
their grievances to the Honourable Court of
Parliament, but alſo Salt-refiners of Eſſex
and Suffolke, alſo many Merchants in the
Weſt parts as far as Weymouth, as alſo from
Yarmouth, and many other ports North as
farre as Newcaſtle, that came up to London
onely to informe the Court of Parliament of
the great burden they have beene forced to
lye under, even to many of their undoings:
And many more would come up, had they
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42794:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not beene ſo impoveriſhed by them the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentees,
that they are not able to beare their
charges in comming ſo farre to complaine of
their grievances. In generall, they have been
the oppreſſors of Fiſhermen, and all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of theſe North Eaſt parts of England,
to the value of many thouſand pounds in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimation,
above foureſcore thouſand pounds
ſince the time of their entring into theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,
which can be made plainly to appeare
by one yeares importation for forraigne and
Scottiſh Salt, collected out of the Cuſtome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe
bookes, and Meters bookes of London,
and for native Salt out of their owne bookes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the yeare 1637. (which was in the time
of their firſt Patent) of Bay and Spaniſh Salt
there was imported but 1364. Wey, which
at 48. s. 6 d. <hi>per</hi> Wey, is impoſt 3307. l. 14. s.
whereas in the yeare 1634. when the trade
was free there was 4620. Wey of forraigne
Salt imported, by which may be obſerved
the decay of forraigne Trade during the time
of their Impoſt.</p>
            <p>That the Impoſt of forraigne Salt was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
and taken of all the Subjects between
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42794:8"/>
Barwicke and Southampton, by vertue of
Privy Seale dated in May 1636. procured by
<hi>Edward Nuttall,</hi> and others his aſſociates, but
nothing brought to accompt by them, nor
paid to his Majeſties uſe for the two yeares
and 6. moneths, (as can yet appeare.)</p>
            <p>That of Scottiſh and native white Salt
Shields meaſure, there were expended for
land uſe about 16000. Weyes, which at 10.
s. <hi>per</hi> Wey Impoſt, and 10. s. <hi>per</hi> Wey in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of price, which came to paſſe by the
Patentees contracting with the Scotch for
deare ſelling, and can appeare to be damage
to the ſubjects at leaſt in one yeare, in the
price of the white Salt 16000. l.</p>
            <p>That for Fiſhers uſe of Scottiſh and native
Salt, an eſtimate of 3000. Shields Wey, and
upwards, at 3. s. 4. d. per Wey Impoſt, and
6. s. 8. d. increaſe of price, is at leaſt 1500. l.</p>
            <p>Whereby it appeares that the ſubjects ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
in one yeare by the firſt Salt Patents,
20807. l. 15. s.</p>
            <p>That the Patentees for Salt continued their
firſt and ſecond Patents above 5. yeares.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:42794:8"/>
By all which it is manifeſt how profitable
theſe Patents have beene to the Patentees,
how little benefit hath accrued to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
thereby, how great a burden to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in generall, and to the old Salt makers,
and the Merchants for forraigne Salt, and all
Fiſhermen, who uſe great quantities thereof,
and to all traders in the ſame in their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.
But if any trader in Salt hath either
joyned with thoſe Patentees in any indirect
way, thereby to uphold them, or the extreme
price of Salt, they are not hereby intended
to be excuſed, but to be left to the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Honourable Houſe of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>And whereas <hi>Horth</hi> and his Aſſociates ſeek
to juſtifie their Patent, comparing it with
that which Maſter <hi>Murford</hi> intended (which
would alſo have beene alike illegall with
theirs, by laying an Impoſt on native Salt (as
they have practiſed.)</p>
            <p>For anſwer thereunto is ſaid, that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulneſſe
of <hi>Murfords</hi> Patent intended,
cannot make that of <hi>Horths</hi> to bee lawfull
which was practiſed by him. For as well
that of <hi>Horths,</hi> as alſo the firſt Patent, have
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42794:9"/>
beene ſufficiently diſcuſſed by the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee
appointed by the Honourable Houſe of
Commons now aſſembled in Parliament, for
the hearing of that buſineſſe, and is by them
moſt juſtly condemned to be illegall, a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoly,
and prejudiciall to the Common-wealth.
For ſo it is, that a Monopoly is a
kinde of commerce in buying and ſelling u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurped
by a few, and ſometimes by one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and foreſtalled by them or him from all
others, to the gaine of the Monopoliſt, and to
the detriment of other men.</p>
            <p>That the latter Patentees further proceed
in their juſtification, declaring the low rates
the ſubjects have beene ſerved at ſince the
time of the ſettlement of their Patent, which
is (as they ſay) at 1. d. ob. <hi>per</hi> Gallon at the
moſt, which in truth is a moſt intolerable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action
on the ſubject. For 1. d. ob. <hi>per</hi> gallon
is no leſſe then 50. s. a Sheilds Wey, which is
but five eight parts of a London Wey, and ſo
the fraught being added, which is 10. s. a
Shields Wey, without Impoſt, it will ſtand
the Adventurer in no leſſe then 4. l. 16. s. a
Wey London meaſure; whereas it may bee
afforded, delivered at London, for 3. l. 12. s.
<hi>per</hi> Wey, which is after the rate of 35. s. <hi>per</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:42794:9"/>
Wey to the Salt makers at Shields for their
Wey, at which ſaid price of 35. s. <hi>per</hi> Wey,
the old Salt makers ſay, they can afford it,
but not under.</p>
            <p>And for the rare of 1. d. <hi>per</hi> Gallon, which
is the cheape price they ſo much boaſt on, it
being but 33. s. 4. d. a Wey Shields meaſure,
at which price, if they ſold any ſo cheape, it
was much againſt their wills, for they deſired
and alwayes ſought to ſettle it at 56. s. 8. d. <hi>per</hi>
Wey Shields meaſure for land uſe, and 46. s.
8. d. for the fiſhing Sea expence, which are
the prices laid downe in the latter Patent: yet
it is true, that they ſold ſome at lower rates:
but they were forced thereto by meanes of
the great plenty that was brought in by the
Scots, who ſold it at London, Yarmouth,
and ſome other Ports at 3. l. a Wey, in <hi>Anno</hi>
1639. and ſome under that price, as aforeſaid,
whereupon the Patentees gave over making
Salt at Shields in their 34 pannes, in regard
they could not attaine to their intended price
of 56. s. 8. d. a Shields Wey, yet ſome of the
old Salt makers ſtill wrought, (though to
their great loſſe, and ſome of their undoings)
ſelling it not for above 30. s. <hi>per</hi> Wey,
yet notwithſtanding they the Patentees took
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42794:10"/>
of them the old Saltmakers, without any
moderation or compaſſion, the full impoſt
of 10. s. for every Shields Wey, for Land
uſe, and 3. s. 4. d. <hi>per</hi> Wey, for the fiſhery
expence. For they had forced the old Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers
and Salt refiners to enter into bond,
for the payment therof unto them, which if
they refuſed to do, they violently forced them
of the Shields, of great Yarmouth, and Salt
Refiners of Eſſex and Suffolke thereunto by
impriſoning of ſome, committing of others
into Purſuivants hands, and cauſing others to
come up and anſwer at the Councell Table,
to their great expence both of money and
time, which extreamity <hi>Horth</hi> uſed in that
time he was governour more then any other
either of the firſt or ſecond Patentees.</p>
            <p>That in the Months of September, Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and November laſt, Salt became deerer
then it was in eight or nine yeares before,
which came to paſſe partly by reaſon of the
great impoſt continued by the Patentees of
the laſt Patent, both on the native and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
Salt, and partly by reaſon of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barring
of the Scottiſh trade, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
in of the Scottiſh Army, at that time
into Newcaſtle and Shields, ſo that white
Salt was ſold in October laſt at the port of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42794:10"/>
London at 6. l. 10. s. <hi>per</hi> Wey, and Bay
Salt in November laſt, was ſold at the port
of London for 8. l. <hi>per</hi> Wey, in regard Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<hi>Strickſon,</hi> Maſter <hi>Nuttall,</hi> and Maſter
<hi>Duke,</hi> three of the laſt Patentees continued
the taking impoſt even untill this preſent
Parliament, which three were alſo chiefe of
the Projectors of the firſt Patent.</p>
            <p>That the 23. of November laſt, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Aſſembly of Parliament upon a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
of the traders in Salt of London, injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the Patentees to bring in their Patents &amp;
ceaſe taking impoſt, and thereupon the price
both of White and Bay Salt did fall at the
port of London to 3. l. a Wey, and ſome for
leſſe: but the windes proving contrary in the
latter part of December, January and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary
laſt, for above ten weekes together:
And alſo ſmall ſtore of Salt having been laid
up in London, or made at Shields by reaſon
of the troubles in thoſe parts with the Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh
Army, the ſtore of white Salt for want
of ſupply was ſoone ſpent here at London:
and had it not beene that the Parliament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that time had taken off the Impoſt of
forraigne Bay and Spaniſh Salt, whereby
there was good quantities of forraigne Salt
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42794:11"/>
brought in, this City of London had been ſo
neceſſitated for Salt, as the like hath not been
knowne. Yet from the Kings Store houſe,
and the Eaſt India Company, and other ſuch
like places, there was ſome ſmall quantities
of white Salt found, which ſupplyed the
preſent want thereof, and was ſold in thoſe
deereſt times at or neere Billingſgate by ſome
of the Traders in Salt for 6. s. 8. d. <hi>per</hi> Buſhell
at moſt, but Bay Salt all that time was ſold for
22. d. or 2. s. a buſhell, and not above all that
time, which was in the Moneth of February,
but before that Moneth was expired, and
ever ſince it hath beene ſold for 2. s. <hi>per</hi> Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhell,
and five peckes to the Buſhell, at or
neare Billingſgate.</p>
            <p>And whereas the Patentees alledge that
white Salt was ſold for 2. s. a pecke, at that
inſtant day, when they publiſhed their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
papers, it is manifeſtly to bee proved that
ten or twelve daies before they publiſhed
them, white Salt was cryed in London
ſtreets at 5. d. a pecke, and ſo ever ſince,
which proves their printed papers to be ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
and falſe, in laying forth ſo many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations
upon the Traders in Salt, as though
they were the cauſe of deare ſelling, which
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42794:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was only their continued impoſitions, and
the occaſion of the time as afore is ſhewed.</p>
            <p>That before the Patentees had obtained
their Patent for Salt, there was imported year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to London great quantities of Spaniſh,
Straits, and French Salt, by Merchants, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigators
and Traders. And that many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Weyes thereof were from thence yearly
tranſported for Flanders, Holland, Denmarke,
and the Eaſt Countrie, whereby ſhips had
their imployments both inwards and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
his Majeſties Cuſtomes improved, and
many poore people, as Porters and Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
had their maintenance thereby; which
trade of Importation is in a manner wholly
decayed ſince the time theſe ſeverall Patents
were obtained.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Objections and Obſervations.</head>
               <p>THat their Patents are found by the
Committee appointed by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for hearing the Salt buſineſſes
to be illegall, and a Monopoly, by reaſon
they brought an impoſt on the native Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture,
and many other oppreſſions to the
Subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:42794:12"/>
That the proſecution hath beene moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
by impriſonments, and forcing many
out of their Trades, and alſo Salt Refiners
and Saltmakers, at Shields and great Yar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth
from their works; and the firſt Paten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees
forced divers at Shields to let them their
Pannes at a Rent, which after two yeares and
ſixe monthes uſe, they returned into their
hands much decayed, and not ſatisfied for
Rent.</p>
               <p>That they would have forced his Majeſties
Subjects to the only uſe of white Salt, which
is not ſo ſufficient for fiſhing Voiages and
many other uſes, as the forraigne.</p>
               <p>That they forced the price both of white
&amp; Bay Salt, in the time of their Patents, to one
third part more then otherwiſe it would have
beene ſold for.</p>
               <p>That there was a far greater quantity of
Salt made in England before their Patents
began, then in the time of the continuance of
their Patents.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Horth</hi> at a hearing at Councell Table
the 19. of December, 1638. to maintaine
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42794:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his unjuſt cauſe in taking his Patent, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſome ſpeech, which was moved about the
inſufficiency of white Salt for preſerving of
Fiſh, and an ancient Trader there ſaying, that
the very ſcales fell off through the weakneſſe
of the white Salt; he the ſaid <hi>Horth</hi> did moſt
falſly reply and affirme, that Codde and
Ling Fiſh had no ſcales, which he did to
convince them of error who came to oppoſe
him: and he with others (whoſe names are
well knowne) did then and there before his
Majeſty and the Lords of the Councell ſo
farre maintaine it, that they were believed,
and that the others that ſpake the truth, were
rejected, whereby the King and Lords were
abuſed by the ſaid <hi>Horth</hi> and others, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
that to the creature which it had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in the creation either for defence or
ornament.</p>
               <p>That it is and hath beene proved both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Majeſty and the Lords, and alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Committee by the Trinity houſe
Maſters, that if forraigne Salt be prohibited,
or ſome heavy impoſt be laid upon it, Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
will be much hindred and decaied.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Horth</hi> alone above the reſt of his part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42794:13"/>
obtained a Commiſſion out of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer,
and did thereby put men to their
corporall oaths, to confeſſe what Salt of their
owne or of others, they knew to be impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and told the Commiſſioners hee was at
Councel about that particular, and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
adviſed him, it muſt bee ſo, and to bee
ſure, would bee with the Commiſſioners
himſelfe, and urge it.</p>
               <p>That the ſettled moderate rate (as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentees
pleaſed to call it) of 56. s. 8. d. <hi>per</hi>
Wey Shields meaſure, will ſtand the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturer
delivered at London in 5. l. 6. s. 8. d.
<hi>per</hi> wey, which is now ſince their Patent cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
ſold at this City of London for 3. l. 10. s.
<hi>per</hi> wey, and long before their Patents be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,
it was ſold cheaper, (that time of three
or foure yeares of hoſtility with France and
Spaine, when there could be little forraigne
Salt imported, onely excepted.) And Bay
Salt at preſent is ſold at 3. l. <hi>per</hi> wey.</p>
               <p>That beyond the power of the Patents,
<hi>Horth</hi> conſtrained the Salt refiners of divers
Counties to pay a double Impoſt.</p>
               <p>That if the commodity of Salt be free for
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42794:13"/>
all men to import, or make it, there cannot be
that ingroſſing, foreſtalling, or regrating
made<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which may be done by a few mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polizing
Patentees, who having the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of it all, may conferre the commodity
upon ſome few particular Traders, for ſome
ſiniſter reſpects, to the deſtruction of others
in their Trades, (as the late times of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
have made manifeſt.) And for thoſe
27. yeares afore ſpecified, the commodity of
Salt being then free of Impoſt, the price was
alwayes reaſonable, and would be ſo now,
and ſo continue, without the helpe of any
Projector.</p>
               <p>That a free trade which is now ſo much
deſired of the ſubject, and a ſettled price, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
of the Patentee, cannot conſiſt, for a
conſtant price forced upon a native manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
is a principall part of a Monopoly.</p>
               <p>That forraigne Salt being abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for ſpeciall uſes, the inhibition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
cannot be admitted, but to the great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of the ſubject.</p>
               <p>That theſe Projectors, which pretend ſo
much of ſupporting the home manufacture
of Salt, have in a maner deſtroyed it, by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42794:14"/>
ſo heavy an Impoſt upon it, as 16. s. for
every London Wey. And if it be not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by taking off the foreſaid Impoſt, it is
like utterly to decay, and then indeed (the
Salt Wiches onely excepted) this Kingdome
muſt wholly depend upon forraigne parts,
for all the Salt ſhall be therein expended.</p>
