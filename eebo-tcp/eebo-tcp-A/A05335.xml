            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE MY SINGVLAR GOOD LORD, Sir <hi>Iohn Puckering</hi> Knight, Lord Keeper of the great Seale of England.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing heretofore (for the great liking which I saw generally conceiued of this worke) perused, allowed, and at my better leisure translated it into English, for the benefit of such as were not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently acquainted with the French; I was bold, ere the Translation were fully finished, to acquaint your L. with the Argument: who concurring with the rest in good liking and Iudgment; my intent to publish it vnder your L<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, was thereby fully confirmed.</p>
            <p>SO that the Picture, which it pleased your L. to like of hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, being in his first lineaments but rudely shadowed; is now presented with all his principal colours perfected and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished. I haue bin carefull to perfect it by the Paterne, and to limme it according to life: yet when I haue all don, it is but a Counterfait; which wanteth much of the perfection of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal.</p>
            <p>THE substance is none of mine; I challenge nought but the shadowe: wherein if the substance be truely represented, I hope it may be allowed of, though it be not curiously beautified.</p>
            <p>I CONFES, it were better to put forth his owne Inuentions, for him that hath means to do it: and that, which this Author affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, namely, that Translations are more painful then praise-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, is by me also acknowledged. For diligence assisted with iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is herein chiefely requisite; and not any excellent knowledge thereunto required: which appeareth more in inuenting of it selfe, then in translating out of others. Which though it be done neuer so faithfully and elegantly, yet cometh alwaies short of the good grace of the Original: as this Author acknowledgeth, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Theodore Gaza an excellent Translator affirme the contrary.</p>
            <p>BVT mine owne wit and Inuention, being vnable to write or inuent any thing worth the reading, yet my wil being a welwisher
<pb facs="tcp:13829:3"/>
to all good Inuentions; I thought it more commendable, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend and communicate to others, that which other men haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently inuented (being not able myselfe to attaine to so much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency) then in publishing any fabulous fancy of mine owne, or matter of meane account, (as many do now adaies) to shew some arrogancy ioyned with my insufficiency.</p>
            <p>THIS worke is a Comparison of this later age, with all antiquity in Armes, in Learning, and all other Excellency. There was neuer any mighty Empire or Monarchie, Kingdom, or Common-wealth, but is here represented; no famous Founder or Gouernor of State, no learned Law-maker, or worthy Warriour, but is here mencio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and ech of them to the other in all conueniences and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties compared: which being don by a man of great learning and iudgment, to men of much businesse and employment (as to your L. especially) who haue no time to fetch euery thing from the Fountaine, search all Antiquitie, and read the Histories of all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, must needs be much auaileable; and the pleasure thereof to all sorts of men accordingly answerable.</p>
            <p>MY duety to your L. (to whom this hath bin long intended) hath at length commanded an Intermission of mine ordinary stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and exercises for the reuiewing and publishing hereof; vnder whose fauourable protection it is now communicated vnto all: who, continually partaking of your L. equity, goodnes, and benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, are bound with me to pray for the continuance of your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, health, and happines euerlastingly.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Ntending to represent according to my ability the interchangeable course and alteration of all things in the worlde, together with the causes of the principall chaunges and varieties, to be perceiued as well in the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour, as in the inferiour part thereof, sithence the time that the first memory of man began euen to this present, I most humbly acknowledge the diuine prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God to be aboue all, beleeuing assuredly, that God almighty, maker, and gouernour of this great worke so excellent in beauty, so admirable in varietie, and so singular in continuance, (to whome I pray to aydeme in this so high, so long, &amp; so difficult an enterprise hytherto neuer attempted of any) is carefull of all affaires happening therein, euen to the least: contayning in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe the beginning, the end, and the meanes of them all, and pursuing the order which he hath giuen to the world, from the beginning in creating it, will that it be tempered by alternatiue chaunges, and maintayned by contraries, his eternall essence remayning alwaies one and vnchangeable.</p>
            <p>First of all then the heauen, notwithstanding it hath receyued of God the maker thereof many excellencies amongst other creatures, beyng round, and hauing throughout his extremities or vtmost partes distant or remoued from the middle or inmost parte, which is the most perfect figure, and most like vnto it selfe; on which he hath also bestowed conuenient circular motion, exempted from the wandring and inconstancie of others, turning it by the same, and in the same, and to him selfe; wherein he doth perseuer: yet neuerthelesse since it hath a body, it can not wholy warrant or preserue it selfe from alteration &amp; chaunge. The Auncients made eight spheres in it; of the firmament, and of the seauen Planets; but since haue beene obserued the ninth, and the tenth: our later Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers affirming that the tenth doth turne round about the world in 24. houres, goyng by the right side from East to West, and by this so swift and impetous motion, doth force and cary with it all the other inferiour spheres, and doth make them make the same turne in the selfe same space of time, although that their proper motions be contrary vnto it, drawing on the left side from West to East: namely the ninth being the slowest, in 49. thousand yeares; The eighth to
<pb facs="tcp:13829:6"/>
haue two, thone of 36. thousand yeres; thother of seuen thousand. The sphere of Saturne in 30. yeres: of Iupiter in 12: of Mars in two: of the Sunne, Venus; &amp; Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury in one yere: of the Moone in 28. daies.</p>
            <p>Time also was made with heauen, and with the starrs, so that hauing had the selfe same beginning they shall also haue the same end, when the world shall be dissolued, returning into their auncient Chaos, and former darknes. For the daies, moneths, yeres, and ages, which were not before that the heauen and the starres were created, incontinently began with them, and number was distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished and obserued by their course: That is, the entercourse of daies and nights by the daily motion of the firmament; The moneth, after that the Moone hath gone ouer her whole circle, and attained to the sunne; The ordinarie yere, when the sunne hath accomplished his course; The great yere, when the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen Planets, and thother fixed starrs, returne to their first places, representing the same nature which was at the beginning. The liues of all things and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed time of their continuance, being determined by lesser or greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, according to the disposition of the matter whereof they are made: spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, growing, florishing, diminishing, perishing, in certainetimes, and by vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall spaces, being reduced to the selfe same end, euery one seeling his corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be the cause of another generation. Insomuch that it seemed vnto Plato that the world was nourished by the consumption, and decay of it selfe, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing alwaies new creatures vnto the old, and raising vp of others like vnto them in the places of those that were perished: without suffering the kinds to faile, or surcease, which by this meanes do alwaies remaine as it were immortall. But howbeit the world is round, and hath not in it either high or low; considering that the place which is in the midst ought not to be termed high or low; nor that which compasseth about be called the midst; neither hath in it any part dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from the other, if regard be had vnto the midst, and euery other opposite thing: notwithstanding in respect of our selues we say that it hath high &amp; low, right and left: That Pole which we see being termed low according to Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle, &amp; thother which is hidden from vs, high: And the East, whence the first motion proceedeth is the right side; The West, is the left; whence commeth a motion contrary to the former: Then the Astrologers and Philosophers affirme, that from the superiour part of the world there discendeth a certaine vertue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compained with light and heat, which some of them do call the spirit or soule of the world; others say it is nature, which mingleth it selfe with the masse of this great body, penetrating, quickening, norishing, and moderating al these va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable thinges vnder the Moone, which being of such efficacy, beginneth first with the fire and the aire, which being moued by the celestial mouings, doe afterwardes moue the water, and the earth, and consequently the natures com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of these fower Elements, as wel men, beasts, birds, and fishes, as plants, trees, herbes, and mettals: That there is the first mouing, whereof do depend all other inferious motions, and al essence whatsoeuer. That there hence do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede diuers temperatures of bodies, inclinations of mindes, manners of men,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:13829:6"/>
properties of nations, vices and vertues, health and sicknes, force and feeblenes; shortnes and length of life, mortality, riches and pouertie, prosperitie and aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity. That there hence al estates and sects do take their beginnings, their course, continuance, and their ends: In briefe, that al this inferiour world doth obey the superiour, &amp; is gouerned by it: Especially that all humaine affaires do depend thereon, and yet are to be preuented by deeds: not that such effects doe neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily come to passe, and inuiolably by a fatall Law: but that they may be auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by wisedome, or turned from vs by diuine praiers, or augmented or dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, or moderated by nurture, custome, and instruction.</p>
            <p>First that the Sunne lightning all thinges with his beames doth giue euident proofe therof, who rising and setting maketh the day and the night, by comming towards vs, and going from vs, causeth the yeres continually to be renewed, and by the obliquity or crookednes of the Zodiacke with the helpe of the twelue signes which are in it, doth distinguishe by his Solstices and Equinoxes, the fower seasons of the sommer and winter, of the spring and haruest: In the which consisteth the vicissitude of life and death, and the change of all thinges: by the mediation of the first qualities, hot and cold, drie and moist, being duely tempered for generation, and vnproportionably distempered for corruption.</p>
            <p>Secondly the Moone euery moneth increasing, decreasing, or at ful, doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersly dispose those humors ouer which she is predominant, shewing amongst other meruailes her manifest power ouer the ebbing and flowing of the tydes in the Ocean. Then the other starres both wandring and fixed do breed in the aire changes of heat and cold, winds, thunder, raine, haile, &amp; snow; and by their aspectes, eclipses, oppositions, coniunctions, distances, apparences, obscurities, greatnesse, swiftnesse, slownesse, do bring foorth great, and diuers generall, and particuler euents; of warres, dearthes, famines, plagues; of inundations, of drouthes, and heates; according to the correspondency of the parts of heauen and earth, the disposition of the matter which they meete with all, and diuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the time in which they worke their effects. So the causes both of these coti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, menstruall, annuall, and other the rarest mutations happening here below, are attributed to the celestiall motions, and to the quality of the matter whereon they worke. Considering, that in the world, the elements, and their compounds are as the matter; the celestial bodies, &amp; superior intelligences, as efficient causes which by their heat, &amp; light in proceeding, giue motion to all inferiour things. First the daily motion which the firmament maketh is cause both of liuing and of dying; and the annuall course of the Sunne assisted with the Moone &amp; other starres, of the continuation and successiue change: But the most rare and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable mutations in states, sectes, and arts, ought to bee referred to the ninth and eight sphere: the diuersity which is found in them proceeding of the variable motion of that sphere, somtimes to the East, somtimes to the West, now to the South, then to the North which is called the motion of trepidation. The Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians also haue diuided this longe space of time, by the great coniunctions of the Plannets, namely of the three superiour Saturne, Iupiter, and Mars: which they maintayne to haue more power ouer the principall alterations
<pb facs="tcp:13829:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of this inferiour worlde, according to the qualities of the triplicities in the which they happen, as fiery, ayrie, watery, or earthly. That there haue alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy beene seuen, in the space of fiue thousand, fiue hundred and thirty yeares, (for so many the Hebrewes reckon from the beginning of the worlde,) and that the eigth shalbe in the yeare of Christ 1604. The Chaldees, Persians, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians, and auncient Grecians iudged of the notable euents of the worlde by the Eclipses of the Sunne and Moone, and by those Starres, which haue their aspectes, towarde the places of the Eclipse, or which arise togither, or which are in the midst of heauen. Belus the Babylonian, (as Seneca alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth) appointed the times both of the deluge, and conflagration of the world, affirming that then all earthly substaunces should be burnt, when all the starres hauing now diuers courses, should meete togither in the signe of Cancer, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the same place, in such a position as a straight line might passe through all their circles: And then should all be drowned, when the same starres in the like sort should meet in Capricorne, both signes of great efficacy, &amp; power, in cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the yere. The ancient Poetes vnder the fables of Phaeton, &amp; of Deucalion, and Pyrrha, haue represented these two ruines of the world, the one by fire, the other by water. Also the Egiptia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> priest in Plato his Timaeus discoursing with So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, saith that many ruines haue come vnto the world &amp; shal come hereafter, the greatest by fire and water: the lesser by earthquakes, wars, famine &amp; pestilence.</p>
            <p>And that the tale of Phaeton the sonne of the Sunne is not altogether estraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from truth, that is, that being mounted on his fathers chariot, &amp; not able to guide it aright, he burnt things on earth, and was slaine himselfe with lightning: for as much as in long space of time do happen many such destructions by fire, by reason of the disorder happening about the earth, &amp; in the celestiall motions. That then those which inhabite in the mountaines, &amp; in drie places, are sooner destroyed then such as dwell by the seaside or neare the riuers. But contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise when it pleaseth God to cleanse the earth by inundations, then the dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers on plaines, and valleys, to be forceably caried into the sea by the impetuosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of riuers, while the inhabitauntes of the hils remaine in safety. That those which remaine after such tempests are ignorant of that which is past, and vnfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished of learning, which by little and little they recouer afterward.</p>
            <p>Others say, that in long space of time there are certaine periods appointed for the world, which while they endure, all thinges do come to their vigour; and which being ended, they do al perish: but that al of them end their course with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the reuolution of the great yere. And that when the one commeth to end, and the other is ready to begin, there are many strange signes seene both in earth and in heauen. Wherefore many are of opinion that some great alteration doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch, considering the signes which within these fewe yeres haue appeared in heauen, in the starrs, in the elements, and in al nature. Neuer were the Sunne and Moone eclipsed more apparantly; neuer were seene so many Comets, and other impressions in the aire; neuer did the Sea and the riuers so violently ouerflowe their bankes; neuer haue bin heard such earthquakes; neuer were borne so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and so hydeous monsters: Neither hath there euer bin seene since the memory
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:13829:7"/>
of man, so many and so often changes to come to passe in Countries, Nations, Maners, Lawes, Estates, and Religions. The course of the sunne is no more such as it was wont to be in old time, neither are there the same points of the Solstices and Equinoxes: but within this fourteene hundred yeres since Ptolomey liued, who was a most diligent obseruer of the course of the world, it is come neerer vnto the earth then at that time it was, about twelue degrees. Moreouer they say, that al the parts of the Zodiacke and the whole signes haue chaunged their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and that the earth is remoued from his first scituation, being not entierly &amp; absolutely (as afore it was) the center of the world. Some also (as Hipparchus a famous Astrologer amongst the Grecians) haue giuen out, that the celestial mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in time to come, shall go a contrary course, and that the course of the starrs shalbe changed, the East becomming West, and the South, North. In the meane time, the continuation of the successiue alteration which we see here belowe, consisteth in the mouing cause, and in the first matter. The cause that moueth is of two sorts, thone being the first and chiefe mouer immoueable, thother the first mouer moueable, by whose vertue and influence (gouerned by the diuine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence) the corruptible things in this sensible world, are incessantly restored &amp; renewed, through the meanes of generation: while the first matter subiecteth it selfe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually to al mouings &amp; changings in the same perpetuity, that the first mouer, moueth &amp; formeth, &amp; neuer faileth to produce these transitory things.</p>

               <head>OF THE VICISSITVDE WHICH THE <hi>fower Elements haue amongst them selues, and euery one by it selfe.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THat successiue alteration which is in the inferiour part of the world, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth principally in the fower Elements, of which it is compounded, which doe receiue continual change both amongst themselues togither, and eche of them seuerally. First when the water is thickned, it seemes to become a stone, or a peece of earth; when it vapours away, to be breath or aire. Also the aire en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened is conuerted into fire: the fire extinguished and thickned is turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to aire: againe, the aire thickned, into mists and clouds, whence proceedeth wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Also we see of water, earth and stones to be ingendred, in such sort that they giue one to another, by turne and course a continual generation. Seeing then they neuer remaine in the same estate, it is hard to discerne thone from the other: But that which we see to be now of one forme, then of another, and like vnto fire, we must not call it fire, but like vnto fire; neither water, but such a thing as water; and so likewise in the rest, as thinges which haue not any stability. Wee ought not to signifye them by names, such as wee vse to demonstrate any thing, as when wee say this or that, for they flie, and will neuer abide this demonstration, being onely applyable to thinges which are stable: but eche of them ought to bee called such and such, according to his similitude, as the fire, and whatsoeuer else hath generation. But that wherein they seeme to bee formed and fashioned agayne, ought onely to bee designed by this, or that; remaining alwaie the same without diminishing either power or faculty,
<pb facs="tcp:13829:8"/>
and continually receyuing all, without retayning euer any semblable forme. It is the first matter exposed to all nature, to receiue any forme, and beyng stirred and formed by those thinges which happen on it, sometimes it seemeth to be of one sorte, and sometimes of another. But the matter that is subiect to such à formation, should not be well prepared or ordered, if it were not of it selfe without forme, and naturally despoyled of all the formes which it is to receiue: for if it were like to any of these thinges, when his contrary or any other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture should come, it could not well represent it hauing the other already: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it behoueth it to be exempted of all shapes figures and formes, which must receyue into it selfe all kindes. Wee will not say than that the mother and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle of this inferiour world, is the earth, the ayre, the fire, the water, or anything which is made of them, or whereof they are made: but that it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisible nature without forme, yet capable of any; to be comprehended onely by the vnderstanding with reason, and not to be perceiued by the senses: that the fire seemeth to be somewhat that is heated, and the water somewhat that is moistned, likewise the aire, and the earth according as it receiueth their formes, suffering the other passions which depend of them, by meanes whereof it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be of all formes. But because it hath not forces or faculties, neyther of the like qualitie, nor of the same waight, it keepeth not any equalitie, but is vnequally moued, or stirred of these kindes which againe are moued of it: by which motion they are caried hither, &amp; thither, and discerned the one from the other by kinds &amp; qualities, obseruing the order which is giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, to the end, that by the coherence of different bodies, there should not remayne that confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, which was before the constitution of the world.</p>
               <p>These foure Elements so different in natures and qualities, and contrary one to another, are assembled by such à proportion, that those which are light are held downe by waight least they should mount higher, and contrariwise the heauy, least they should fall, are ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged on the light ones which tend alwaies vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, remaining all by à like force co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>strained, &amp; kept in their places, by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual circuit of the world, which turning alwaies in it selfe, holdeth the earth balanced in the midst, as the lowest of al, which againe in counterchange doth ballaunce the other Elements themselues, which holde it as it were ballaunced and hanged in the midst of them. The water is diffused rounde about it. And the ayre is caried ouer them both making but one globe. The fire is seated high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, which beyng placed betweene the heauen and the aire, is pure on that parte which toucheth the celestiall bodie, and impure in that which is next to the ayre, receyuing many chaunges in diuers formes. And although in that parte next vnto heauen, it haue no contrarie to corrupt it, remayning in his naturall place apt for the conseruation thereof; neuerthelesse, the partes of it doe not alwaies perseuer in their puritie, by reason of the difformitie or diuersitie of the motion which turneth it, and shaketh them, and forceth them downwards to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the aire euen to the earth, where they perish &amp; are consumed. Likewise, the ayre is diuersly altered by the others which are next vnto it, for being diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into three partes, the highest, the middle, and the lowest, the highest parte
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:13829:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
next vnto the fire, to the celestiall mouings, and the starres, is thinnest, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest; the lowest next vnto the earth, is thickest, and grossest; the meane or middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most is temperate betwixt both; yet colder notwithstanding then either of them both: for the highest doth participate with the heate of the starres, the inferior is warmed by the vapours proceeding from the earth, and then againe by the repercussion of the Sun beams, and also by the artificiall fires vsed amongst men, and the naturall which are hid in the earth. But the meane being secluded from both extremities doth continue in his coldnes. The aire then being thus diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, is for the most part variable, inconstant, and changeable, especially neere vnto the earth, where it doth and suffereth much according to the diuers sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of the places, and according to the aspects, and different course of the starres, which by their contrary rising, and falling, doe raise exhalations and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, from whence proceede the windes, clowdes, showers, tempestes light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninges, thunders, haile, frost, snow, and other calamities of the earth, with great strife of natural things amongst themselues: some striuing vpwards, which are forceably kept downe by resistance of the starres: others being violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caried away: the raine descendeth, the cloudes ascend, the waters are dried, the haile and snowe do fall, the Sun beames reflexed doe heate, the windes whirling about blow vnequally thone against thother, being sometimes calme, and sometimes stormie. And the Northren windes are raised by Iupiter, the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterne windes by the sun, the Southren by Mars, the VVesterne by the Moon: Or els by the foure triplicities of the twelue signes of the Zodiacke, those three which are of qualitie hot and drie, mouing winde from the oriental part vnder the equinoctiall line called East: the three other cold and drie, raising the Southern wind comming from vnder the Pole antarticke; the other three hot and moist, the West winde being also vnder the equinoctiall line: the other which are colde and moist, the North winde comming from vnder the pole articke: which windes haue their different properties according to the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from whence they proceed, and where they blow, mouing about the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the earth, euen as the starres by which they are raised. The foure prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall windes haue foure other collaterall: all which eight together are called entier or whole windes: betwixt whom are placed eight halfe windes, and sixteene other quarters of windes, and by these is all nauigation ordered.</p>
               <p>But the water, on which they saile, being contiguous or ioyning to the aire, receiueth no lesse varietie than it, and maketh but one globe with the earth: For as the earth being drie of his owne nature cannot endure without moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, neither should the water haue any where to abide without resting it selfe on the earth; they haue therefore bin thus by nature ioyned together: the one opening the vaines and conduites of the earth, the other passing through it both within and without, to serue instead of à bande vnto it. All water of his proper motion descendeth downe from on high, but in the Ocean sea which enuironeth the earth, are found three motions: thone from East to West, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the North towards the South, the third of the daily ebbing &amp; flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: for from six houres to six, it aduaunceth, and enlargeth it selfe; then it
<pb facs="tcp:13829:9"/>
abateth and retyreth. The which motions are seene also in the Mediterranean sea towards the bankes.</p>
               <p>The cause of the first motion from East to West, is, the daily mouing of the firm ament, by whose impetuositie all the Spheres are moued, with a good part of the fire and the aire. The other from the North towards the South; is, because that the Sea is higher in the North parts, then in the South; in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that the Northren cold ingendreth more water, then the Sea can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine within the space, distance, and heigth of his bankes; and the water which is in the South part is consumed and diminished, by the heat of the same: So one part of the water in the North, forceth downe an other on that side which is lowest, and moueth accidentally from the place of his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</p>
               <p>The third followeth the reuolution of the Moone, which alwaies increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and decreasing, appeareth sometimes horned, sometmes half round, some times almost round, and sometimes spotted: then by and by cleere &amp; great, when she is at full, and anon she is not seen at all: Sometimes she shineth all night, sometimes ariseth late, sometimes she shineth all day, supplying the brightnes of the sunne; and comming to Eclipsie, yet appeareth notwithstanding: and at the monethes end hideth her selfe; when she is said to trauaile. Sometimes also she is low, and sometimes high, which neuer happeneth after one sort: for sometimes one would say that she were fixed to the firmament, other whiles that she touched the top of the mountaines, so low she is abased; she is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times found in the South side of the heauens, and sometimes we must seeke her in the North.</p>
               <p>Since then that she is so variable, it is no meruaile if the ebbings and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Tydes in the sea, which are caused chiefely by her, are also vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: First in the daily motion which the Moone maketh with the heauen in twentie fower howers, there are two tydes ebbing, and two flowing, the sea increasing by the space of six howers, and diminishing six others, which are twelue: And it doth asmuch in other twelue howers, which are twentie fower. Their augmentations are not alwaies alike in all times and places, for by the space of seauen daies, the waters do increase, when they call them liue waters; and seauen other daies they decrease, when they are called dead waters. In such sort, that from the first day of the change of the Moone, vntil the eight, which is the first quarter, the waters are diminished; and from the said quarter vntill the fifteenth, which is full Moone, they are still augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: and from thence till the third quarter, they goe still decreasing; and from that to the coniunction, they are increased againe. So the first day of the Moone is chiefe of the waters, and the second day the waters are yet verie great, and the third in like sort; but the fourth day they begin to waxe lesse, and so go diminishing from day to day, vntil they come to the eight: for then are the low waters: and on the ninth likewise: and the tenth almost the same: then on the eleuenth is the rising of the waters, when they begin a little to augment.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:13829:9"/>
And from that time forwarde they increase euery day vntill the fifteenth when it is full moone, and then it beginneth againe to be head water, and on the sixteenth it increaseth likewise, and almost vnto the ende of the seuenteenth. But on the eighteenth it decreaseth, and goeth so diminishing euery day vntill the thirtieth, when as she is in coniunction: And so on the first day it begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth againe to behead water, and proceedeth thus increasing and decreasing as hath bin said.</p>
               <p>Yet in these increasings the waters are not so high at one time as at another; but greater at one time and lesse at another. Also the ebbing and flowing of tides are not equal in all places. Neuertheles when the moone is at Northeast, it is full sea; and when she is at Southeast, it is low water. Also there is nothing perpetuall in the earth; sometime the sea or some other water enclosed within it, breaking out forceably, doth couer a part thereof; sometimes againe it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tireth. The Riuers and fountaines are dryed vp, and there arise new in other places. Some Countries are turned into standing pooles and marishes, others into sandie deserts, others into woodes: then being husbanded and laboured, they become fertile of barrain: and againe on the contrarie, barrain of fruitful. The Mountaines are made plain, and the plaines are lifted vp: some places are swallowed by Earthquakes, or scorched by exceeding heats. When it hath long bin manured, it waxeth wearie; then by rest and cherishing it recouereth vigour. In tract of time it waxeth old, if not wholie, yet at the least in his parts; then is renewed and becommeth young againe. We see euery yeare at the spring time, and beginning of Summer, how being watered with small rayne, caused by soft windes, and moderately heated, it openeth the seedes of all things which before were shut vp, and putteth some of them into herbes, stalkes, and eares, others into stems and husks, others into budds, others into tender tops<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the garden trees yeeld buds, flowers, leaues, and fruit: the forestes and woods are clothed with greene, bearing on their branches and boug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es, the birdes pricked with a desire of engendring, which record by themselues their melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious songs: The Fishes leape; and the beasts amidst the greene pastures skip vp and downe, being inflamed with loue. In briefe euery thing springeth, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, embelisheth, florisheth, and fructifieth: all things are renewed. On the contrarie, when Autumne and Winter do returne, all is full of horror, and of sadnes, cold, raine, dirt, sleete, hayle, snow, frost, yce, foggy mists, long nights, and almost continuall darknes. We trauaile the earth day and night, more to satisfie our pleasures, then for our necessarie norishment. And notwithstanding that which it endureth superficially might seeme tollerable, if we did not pierce it so farre, as to seeke gold and siluer, brasse, copper, lead, tinne, yron, stones to build, and others accounted precious in the entrailes therof. Neither is it onely thus vexed by men: but it seemeth that the three other Elements haue conspired the ruin of this one alone; without speaking of the heauen it selfe, which by his vntemperate disposition, hath cut off a great part therof. Might it not haue suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed the Sea to haue compassed it, and to haue cut off a great part therof, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out stretching it selfe into it, in so many gulfes, little distant the one from the
<pb facs="tcp:13829:10"/>
other, breaking through mountaines, and making violent ruptures, as though it would spread it selfe ouer all. Then so many riuers, lakes, marishes, so many standing pooles, as are throughout, so many springs, and little brooks, so many swift and raging streames. The aire shaketh it, causing it to lose that naturall propertie of beeing immoueable, ouerwhelming not onely fieldes, houses, townes, cities, but whole nations, and countries, oftentimes not leauing any appearance, whereby one may see, that there haue bin such. Then the fire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so fertile, that it ingendreth of it selfe, and groweth of little sparks becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in an instant, great and impetous, burneth it in many places, both with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out and within, beeing dispersed about the chimnies, arysing out of billets and sticks-ends beaten together, appearing thorough the cloudes, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of lightning, kindled by burning glasses opposed to the sunne, which also with the other starres doth drie and scorch it excessiuely in some seasons and countries.</p>
               <p>It is a meruaile, that being so vexed on all parts, it is not already consumed, but so farre are these great and violent calamities from distroying it, that they rather helpe to the conseruation thereof. For the Earthquakes by the openings which they make, draw out the corrupted windes which were kept in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trailes of it, and caused within such disordered noise: the inundations do clense the filth; the heats digest those humors which they find too grosse; as the colds and frosts do moderate that which is inflamed.</p>

               <head>HOW ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD <hi>are tempered and conserued by vnlike, and contrarie things.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN like maner is the Earth, and euery other thing in the world tempered and conserued by things of dislike and contrarie qualitie. It is not then without cause, that nature is so desirous of contraries, making of them, all decency, and beautie; not of things which are of like nature. This kind of tempering is the cause, that such things as before were diuers and different, do accord and agree together, to establish, intertain, and embellish one an other, the contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie, becomming vnitie; and the discord concord; the enmitie amitie; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention couenant. Wherefore <hi>Heraclitus</hi> said, that discord, and concord, were the father and mother of all things. And <hi>Homer,</hi> that whosoeuer spake euill of contention, did blame nature. <hi>Empedocles</hi> maintayned, not of discord by it selfe, but that with concord, it was the beginning of all things: meaning by discord, the varietie of things that are assembled, and by concord, the vnion of them: But the vnion in this assemblie ought to exceede the contrarietie: Otherwise the thing should be dissolued, the principles diuiding themselues: So we see in the Heauen contrarie mouings to preserue the world: Venus pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the midst neere vnto Mars, to asswage his fircenes, which of his owne nature is corruptiue: And Iupiter next vnto Saturne, to mitigate his malice. The inferiour world composed of contrarie elements to maintaine it selfe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:13829:10"/>
by the proportion which they haue together; and the natures made of them to preserue themselues, by the temperature of different qualities, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing simple in their nature without any maner of mixtion or composition; and contrarie one to the other when they are compared in their qualities in the highest degree, yet of them are all thinges compounded, and by their commixtion, is the beginning of all generation. There are found in the bodie of the world, Earth, Water, Aire, Fire; Sunne, Moone, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther starres: There is matter, forme, priuation, simplicitie, mixtion, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, quantitie, qualitie, action, and passion. In mans bodie, bloud, flegme, choler, melancholie; flesh, bones, sinewes, vaines, arteries, head, eies, nose, eares, hands, feete, braine, hart, liuer, and splene. In the oeconomical bodie, husband, wife, children, Lord, slaue, master, and seruant. In the politike bodie, Iustice, Fortitude, Prudence, Temperance, Religion, warfare, iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, counsaile, magistrates, and priuate men, noble, and base, rich and poore, young and olde, weake and stronge, good and euill, labourers, artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, merchants, retaylers, and cariers: which are all dislike parts, and the most of them contrarie, conioyned together by due conueniency. Art imitating nature in the painting of blacke, white, greene, blew, yellow, red, and other mingled colours, representeth the portraitures conuenient to those things for the which they are made. And in Musick, of high and low, long and short, is made an accord. Grammer consisteth of letters, vowels and mutes: The Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences can not well be taught without comparing of contraries, thone being considered principally, and in regard of that one, thother accidentally, that it may be auoyded. As Physicke doth accidentally treat of sicknes, to the end to be the better able to preserue health, and to auoyd the other. The Ethicke, and Politicke science doe not onelie shew what is honest, iust, and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; but also that which is dishonest, vniust, and domageable. Insomuch that we may say in all cases, that contraries when they are put neere, one to the other, they appeare the more cleerely: Euen as want maketh riches to be the more esteemed; and the obscuritie of darkenesse commendeth the cleerenesse of light: The sweetnesse of the Springtime is more esteemed by the sharpenesse of Winter: the happinesse of peace, by the calamities of warre; and faire weather after long rayne: So it seemeth, that the good can not be knowen without the euill: and although they be contrarie, yet haue they such a coniunction, that in taking of one, both are tane away. For the good can not be vnderstood, nor esteemed, but by conferring of it with euill to auoid it, neither the euill shunned and eschewed, except that which is good be throughlie knowen. <hi>Plato</hi> sayth the like of pleasure, and sorrow, that although they be two thinges contrarie and repugnant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them selues, and can not bee together in one person, yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse, if any one follow and receiue the one, he is for the most part euer constrained to take the other: as if they were both in one point and extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie conioyned and knit togither. Moreouer it is certaine, that Nature hath not created any thing, vnto which she hath not giuen a contrarie
<pb facs="tcp:13829:11"/>
to withhold it and keepe it backe, where hence proceede the Antipathies, or contrarie affections in all things, aswell animate as inanimate, lyuing as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out life: In beasts, as betweene the Cocke and the Foxe: in fishes, betweene the Mullet and the fish called Lupus, which some take it to be the Pike: in birdes, betwixt the Crow and the Kite: Amongst trees, the Chestnut and Oliue: amongst stones, the Adamant and the Diamant. What then shall we say of men, which are so passionate and inconstant? Truely, that al in all ages, and all kinds of life, publike, priuate, solitarie, contemplatiue, actiue, are inclined to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions and partialities, euen so farre, as euery one to be at variance in him selfe, hauing in his bodie and soule a perpetuall combate betweene reason and concupiscence: And in this maner is the strife amongst children, which yet haue no knowledge, and amongst the Sauages, which haue nothing proper or peculier. There are Sectes in the schooles of Law, Physicke, Diuinitie, Philosophie, and in the conuents and monasteries amongst the Reclus and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluses. No maruaile is it therefore if there be seditions in Cities and Countries, which make people of diuers estates euen to run hedlong, as was sometimes in Rome, that of the common people and the Nobility: Yf there be warres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Lordship and Lordship, kingdom and kingdom, which respectiuely keeps them both in feare: So were aunciently in Greece the Lacedemonians to the Athenians; so to the Romaines, the Carthaginians; and afterward the Parthians.</p>
               <p>So are at this day opposed the Scots to the English; the English to the French; the French to the Italians; The Almaines to the Suitzers; the Africans to the Spaniards; the Turkes to the Christians; the Persians to the Turkes; the Zaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaines to the Persians; being deuided amongst themselues by colours redd and greene, and of that are called Caselbas, and Cuselbas: the Moscouites to the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians; the Tartarians to them both. In the Indies Cochim to Calecut: in high Africk the Moores to the Abissins; thorough out the countrey of the Arabians, the inhabitants of the Mountaines to those that dwel in the Plaines: The Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moores amongst themselues: And in Brasil the Sauluages euen to the eating of one another when they are taken in warre. And it might seeme that these diuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were in some sort necessarie thoroughout the world, and such contrarieties as God hath giuen to euery estate, &amp; almost to euery person profitable to keepe them in feare and humility: for men will soone waxe proud, and are easily puft vp with prosperity and riches: and especially when they misconceaue from whence such grace proceedeth, God is wont to send them aduersities for their chastisment. Wheresore it is ordinarily seene, that euery mighty estate, hauing no forrain enemy findeth some within it selfe: and when it is come to such great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that it cannot be brought vnder, or kept downe by any strange or foraine force, then is it afflicted with partialities, and oftentimes distroied or transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into some other nation, with alteration both of Iustice and politike go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment. Moreouer, when the Countries are to full of inhabitants, and that the malice and subtilty of man is come to the highest; then are they purged and empted by famines and pestilence: to the end that the people which are in

it, being reduced to a lesse number, and chastised, may liue better. But if herewith they amend not, but waxe worse and worse: then either are they exterminated by fire and water, or by Earthquakes ouerwhelmed. God vsing alwaies such rigours against those which perseuer in their wickednes, as he is alwaies readie to receiue to mercie such as are truely penitent, which turne to him, and pray to him with their harts.</p>

               </head>
               <p>HItherto hath bin declared how the world is not onely conserned by the intercourse of the Heauens, and Elements; but also tempered by contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Now to the end we may the better consider the difference which is found in respect of the diuersitie of places, and aspectes of heauen, aswell in plants, trees, fruits, mettals, sauours, colours, and tastes: as in beasts, fishes, birds, and euen in men themselues, and all their affaires: we will briefly touch as far foorth as shall belong to our present purpose, the fiue Zones of the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table earth; the seauen Climats; fower limits, East, West, North, and South; the two sides or hemisphers, longitude, and latitude; the three parts thereof, Europe, Asia, and Africke, vnto which is also added America: the varietie of shadowes, daies, and seasons, with the diuers maners of inhabiting: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that all these considerations serue to the knowledge of the world, and the chaunges which in times past haue happened therein, and do euery day come to passe. The Auncients diuided the Heauen, &amp; consequently the earth, into fiue Zones, thinking that those two that are vttermost about the two Poles, North and South, did make those two parts of the earth which are subiect to them vnhabitable by their extreme &amp; continual cold. Also that that part of the heauen which beholdeth the middle of the earth vnder the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall, made it likewise vnhabitable, by reason that the Sunne hauing there his continuall course, burneth with his beames, beating on it so neere, and perpendicularly, all the countrie lying vnder that Zone; That the two others which are betweene the burning Zone and the Poles, were temperate, as also those parts of the earth which are answerable vnto them: But that one could not passe verie well from the one to the other, because of the burning Zone being in the midst.</p>
               <p>But by the latter voyages and nauigations, the whole earth is found to be inhabited, yea, euen vnder the Poles themselues, beeing both in the midst and in the vtmost parts frequented with men, and with singuler commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the heat of the middle-most accounted burning hoat, being lesse vnder the Equinoctiall, then the Tropicke, not a whit hindering the passage from one of the temperate vnto the other. For although that vnder the Equinoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall, the sunne-beames are perpendicular twice in a yeare, yet do they but little harme, by reason that they stay not long there: the Zodiake being
<pb facs="tcp:13829:12"/>
streight, and not oblique or crooked in that place: Then the nightes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there continually equall in length vnto the daies, doe mitigate with their colde the heat of the dayes. But vnder and neere vnto the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pickes, the Zodiacke beeing crooked, the Sunne stayeth longer there, and discendeth not so swiftlle vnder the Horizon, makinge the dayes longer, and the sunne hotter; yet sufferable notwithstanding, as wee see by innumerable people dwelling vnder the Equinoctial, and betweene the Tropickes.</p>
               <p>In the vttermost part of the North dwell the Liuonians, Noruegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Lithuanians, Swedens, Moscouites, Lapians, and Brarmians last of all, hauing in their depth of winter the aire full of foggs, and great clouds, with much snow, and frost: In such sort, that both by water and by land, they make their traficke and warres on yce. But when summer returneth, the countrie is vncouered, and made more temperate, by the light which the Sunne giueth there longer in one place, then in another; according as it is neerer or farther remoued from the Pole: Euen as in the hoat quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, some places by the presence of the Sunne are disinhabited, or at least incommodiously inhabited, which by his departure do recouer an habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble temperature.</p>
               <p>The superficies or vpper face of the Earth hath bin also otherwise distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished: for by how much any countrie declineth on one side or other from the Equinoctial, so much is their day the longer in Summer, and their night in Winter. In such sort, that according to the diuers increase of the daies, the spaces of the earth haue bin distinguished, attributing to euery Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate halfe an howers increase. And the places subiect vnto these Climates haue bin noted out, either by famous Cities, or riuers, or mountaines: as by Meroe, Sienna, Alexandria, Rhodes, Rome, Borysthenes, and the mountaine Ripheus, fabulously inuented: where the longest day is of 16. howers, and a quarter; and the Pole is eleuated 50. degrees. The Aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents staied at this seauenth; not knowing the Regions, Countries, Seas, and Isles that are beyond it. At this day by the same reason there may others be added.</p>
               <p>The fower limitts or boundes of the worlde are, the East, West, South, and North; differing in this, that the South and the North are stable and immoueable; But the East and West do neuer remaine in one estate, by reason of the ascent and descent which the Sunne maketh in the signes of the Zodiacke. Wherefore Eratosthenes following nature, diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the world chiefly into two partes, the South and North, imagining that from them proceeded the diuersitie of all inferiour thinges, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their neerenesse or distance from the sunne. True it is, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ariseth some difference; but all consisteth not therein, as hereafter shall be declared. Moreouer, nature hath indewed euery one of these extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, or vtmost partes with some singuler excellencie: For toward, the East, there India brings forth Rubies, Emeraulds, Pearles, and many other
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:13829:12"/>
precious stones, both out of the earth and the sea; the great and mightie Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, the high palme-trees full of wine, and loden with nuts: And Serica in that quarter hath first giuen vs the Silke, which is had of wormes bred in Mulberie-trees: Arabia in the South yeelds incense, ebony and cotton: Iewrie next vnto it the balsme, and the cedar: Ethiopia, Cassia and Ciuet: The Moluccaes in the farthest partes of the West, Pepper, spice cloues, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeggs, and other druggs. The North, the Alces, Beares, Ounces, and other beastes which are not seen elswhere: hony and waxe, without the industrie of man, throughout the large forestes; exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site skinnes of Martins, Sables, and others of great accompt in the other parts of the world, to make furres for great Lordes. Cornelius Tacitus saith, that Amber groweth onely in Borussia, and is fished there: as in the South comes incense, and balsme. Also the earth being spherical or round, is parted into two equall sides, called Hemispheres; and by the roundnesse of it from East to West, it commeth to passe, that there it is sooner day and night; and by the roundnesse of it from South to North, that there are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies seen some starres about the Pole Articke; not about the Antarticke, which remayneth hidden from vs which are one this side the earth, as ours is also vnseen of those on the other side. The longitude or length of the earth, is taken from the West to East: the latitude or bredth from the South to the North. The auncients, as Isocrates diuided the earth onely into two parts, Europe and Asia, afterwards they added Africke for the third, this diuision taking his beginning at the straight of Gibraltar, where the Atlanticke sea engulfeth it selfe within the land, making the Mediterranean or midland sea, by which these three are diuided, Africke remayning on the right hand, Europe on the left, and Asia in the midst. On the other side the riuers Nilus, and Tanais, made these diuisions long agone. But as for Tanais, it cannot now stand for a bound, so many innumerable people and countries beeing knowen now on this side, which heretofore were vnknowen to the Auncients. To these three also it is necessarie to add a fowerth taken of America, and other landes newly discouered towardes the West and the South, of which it is not yet knowen, whether they be ioyned or no to Asia: that is to say, whether they ought to bee reputed maine land, or Isles.</p>
               <p>These thinges premised as necessarie to the vnderstanding of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course that followeth; wee will intreat henceforward of the varietie of shadowes, inequalitie of dayes and nightes, intercourse of the seasons of the yeare, according to the diuers habitations; and will propose the diuersitie of thinges, according to the difference of places. Then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the shadowes, wee find that they chaunge with the Sunne, and from Countrie to Countrie: for by how much the Sunne is higher, the shadow is the lesse; and by how much he is the lower, the shadow is greater; in such sort, that alwaies it is greater in the morning and euening then at noonetyde. Vnder the two Tropickes there is no shadowe at
<pb facs="tcp:13829:13"/>
noone on the daies of the Solstices, nor vnder the Equinoctiall, in the daies of the Equinoxes. The inhabitants on the one side and the other haue their shadowes opposite, the one on the right hande, the other on the left. To those that dwell vnder the Poles, they are round about them in manner of roundels, or milstones. The Sunne then going al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies either towardes the North, or on the Equinoctiall, or towardes the South, maketh fiue sortes of shadowes through out the world: that is, to the East, to the West, to the North, to the South, and one straight shadowe. Towardes the East it maketh shadow when it setteth; to the West, when it riseth; towardes the North, when it comes from the South; and when hee whose shadowe is made, is neerer to the North, then is the Sunne; and towardes the South when hee that makes the shadowe, is neerer then the sunne is to the South. Also, the straight sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow is when the Sunne is on our Zenith. All these fiue sortes of sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes happen onelie to those which dwell betweene the Tropickes, and they which inhabite vnder the Equinoctiall haue but fower, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes East, and West, They that are vnder the Tropicke of Cancer, haue their shadowe towardes the North, and those that are vnder the Tropicke of Capricorne, towardes the South; And once in the yeare direct when the Sunne entreth into that Tropicke. Those which dwell wythout the Tropickes haue but three shadowes, towardes East, and West; and those which dwell in the North haue their shadow towardes the North, and such as inhabite the South part, haue their shadow to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the South; and neuer haue it direct, or straight. Concerning the dayes and nightes, they are alwayes alike vnder the Equinoctiall, but thence they goe continually increasing and diminishing, either by the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the earth which maketh the night, or by the roundnesse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of which bringeth the daye. They then which inhabite Northward from the Equinoctial, haue their dayes increasing when the Sunne retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth from the Tropicke of Capricorne, to that of Cancer; and those which inhabite the South, haue the contrarie: namely their nights increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing in length, and their daies decreasing by reason that the sunne goeth euery day farther &amp; farther from them towards the North. Also when he commeth into Aries on the eleuenth of March, hee treadeth the Equinoctial line, and maketh the dayes equall with the nightes on euery side; but when hee hath passed the first point of Aries, the dayes become longer then the nightes, to those on the North; and shorter to those on the South. And the eleuenth of Iune when the Sunne enters into Cancer, is the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest day, and the shortest night; and on the other side the contrarie: for the Sunne is then neerest to the one, and farthest from the other. Also from thence forward he beginneth to discend; and returning by little and little, maketh the dayes shorter, and the nightes longer to them which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite Northward; and contrarywise to the inhabitantes of the South. Moreouer, when he is in Libra, the thirteenth of September, he traceth
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:13829:13"/>
againe the Equinoctiall line, and then are the nights, and the daies equall. But from thence he discendeth towards the signe of Capricorne; and the nights become longer then the daies, to them that dwel in the North; and the daies longer, and shorter nights to those of the South. Finally, being come to the Tropick of Capricorne, he maketh to vs heere the shortest day, and the longest night; and in the South the longest day, and shortest night. For this is also a place wher the sunne is neerest to the one, and farthest from the other. And by how much the Pole is eleuated aboue the Horizon of euery habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the daies and nights are so much the longer: In somuch that they which haue their Zenith vnder the Circle articke, and to whom the Pole is raised aboue their Horizon 66. degrees and a halfe; when the sunne commeth into the first point of Cancer on the eleuenth of Iune, they haue a day of 24. howers; and their night is almost as an instant: because the sunne toucheth their Horizon but a moment for that day. And on the thirteenth of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber when the Sunne is in the first degree of Capricorne, they haue then a night of 24. howers, and in a maner but a moment of day, by reason that the sunne toucheth their Horizon in an instant, and by and by setteth, and they account this small touch for a day. They which are vnder the Antarticke circle haue the cleane contrarie. And those which haue their Zenith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Circle and the Pole of the world, while the Sunne is going to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the North, that which their Horizon discouereth of the Equinoctiall shalbe vnto them for one day. And if it be the quantitie of one signe, their day shall endure one Moneth, and if of two signes, it shalbe of two Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes, and so for the rest. And he which shalbe vnder one of the Poles, shall haue all the yeare long but one day, and one night. In such sort, that if he were vnder the Pole Artick, those sixe Monethes in which the sunne is going towards the North, shalbe a day vnto him without night, and the other sixe Monethes while the Sunne is going towards the South, should be a night vnto him without any day. And on the contrarie, to those which are vnder the Pole Antartick: In so much that halfe the yeare shalbe vnto them a day, and the other halfe a night; by reason of the roundnes of the world, which waxeth lesse and lesse toward the Poles. So their Horizon which are neerest to the Poles, discouereth the greatest part of the day which the sunne maketh when he goeth on their side; the earth and water not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering them of the sight of the sunne, all the time that he ascendeth and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendeth, vntil he commeth to that place where their Horizon doth not disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any thing of the Circle or course which he maketh about the world; and also by how much that part is greater, so much shall the day be longer.</p>
               <p>Manie do erre, thinking the increasing and decreasing of daies to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede equally throughout the yeare; because that in deede they increase as much in the one onely moneth of March; as they did in the monethes of Ianuarie and Februarie together. And on thother side, they are shortned as much in the one onely moneth of September, as they were afore in Iuly and August. The cause is, for that the Sunne on the twelfth of March parting
<pb facs="tcp:13829:14"/>
from out the Equinoctiall, and returning towardes the North vntill the twelfth of Aprill, maketh twelue degrees: and from the twelfth of Aprill vntill the twelfth of May, eight: and from the twelfth of May to the eleuenth of Iune that he commeth into the Tropicke, three and a halfe: which are together 23. degrees and a halfe, which is the greatest declyning of the sunne. In such sort that he separateth himselfe the first moneth by thone halfe of his declining, and the second moneth a third part, and the third a sixth part. And so the length of the day is equall with the night, on the eleuenth of March; and from thence vnto the eleuenth of Aprill, the day increaseth thone halfe of his whole increase; and from the twelfth of Aprill vntill the twelfth of May, it increaseth a third part; and from the twelfth of May to the eleuenth of Iune, it increaseth a sixth part. In the vttermost North of Moscouia, the day and the night, are each of them three monethes in the time of the Solstices. During the Summer time, in May, Iune, and Iuly; there is day continually; In the Winter time, in Nouember, December, and Ianuarie, continuall night; In Februarie, March, and Aprill, first the day is short, the night long: and on the contrarie, in August, the night short; in October, long.</p>
               <p>Of the diuersitie of Shadowes; there fall out three sorts of habitations, which we are constrained to expresse in Greeke words, because we haue no other: They are, the Amphiscians, Eteroscians, and Periscians. Amphisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are they which haue their shadowes on both sides of them, Northward and Southward; such as are the inhabitants betweene the two Tropickes, and vnder the Equinoctial; as the Ethiopians, Arabians, and Indians: Etero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scians which haue their shadowes turned on thone side, inhabiting the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate zones, betweene the Polarie, and Tropick circles; such are towards the North, the Spaniards, Frenchmen, Englishmen, Italians, and Greekes: Periscians are they which haue their shadowes round about them in forme of milstones; such are they which dwell vnder the Poles, hauing but one day and one night in the whole yeare, and alway the same six signes aboue the earth, and the six other vnderneath.</p>
               <p>Againe, the inhabitants of the earth compared one to the other, are called Periecians, Antecians, and Antipodes. Periecians may be called collateral, and are they which dwell vnder the selfe same climate, paralelle and Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian drawen through the Poles. They haue this common with vs: First, that they inhabite the same temperate Zone; secondly, that at the same time they haue winter, and summer, and the other seasons, &amp; the increasing of daies and nights; but differ in this, that they haue not the same East, and West, and that when it is high noone with vs, it is midnight with them: Such are the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the Canaries, with the people of China. Antecians are they which inhabit thother temperate zone towards the South, turning their backes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs, distant equally from the Equinoctial on their side, as we are on ours; Hauing then a contrarie latitude, they haue also the seasons of the yere contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; The Autumne in Aries, when the Spring is with vs: The winter in Cancer
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:13829:14"/>
when we haue summer; the spring in Libra, when haruest is here; the summer in capricorn, which to vs is winter; But because they are in the same longitude they haue at the same instant with vs midday and midnight: Such are the Egip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians with the farthest Africans. The Antipodes so called, because they go with their feet opposite to ours, hauing the Horizon &amp; Hemisphers opposed: vnto whom al things are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, winter, sommer, day and night; East &amp; west.</p>

               </head>
               <p>HEnceforward, following our purposed order, we will speake of the diuersitie of thinges according to the difference of places: Where then the heat is neither to extreme and feruent, nor the cold to excessiue and sharpe; where there are neither vnmeasurable raines, nor too violent windes; but the seasons of the yere continue in moderate disposition there is found a conuenient temperature of the aire, holsomnes of waters, and fertility of groundes: by meanes whereof the Countrey is made pleasant, healthsome, apt to bring forth corne and pulse, to norishe all kinde of plants, as well others as wilde, bearing fruite abundantly in their seasons; The beastes, birdes and fishes are better formed, more fruitfull, and of better tast, then elswhere: But where as hot or cold, drie or moist doe exceede, they hurt euery thing and make it worse. The Ethiopians being neere vnto the Sunne, which burneth them with his beames, are blacke, hauing their heare and beard frisled, or curled. On the contrary they which inhabite the colde and ycie countries, haue their skinne white and soft, their heare yellow and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: both the one and the other being naturally cruell by reason of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessiue cold and heat. They are in both countries of high stature, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth of the abundance of heat in respect of the Ethiopians; and of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant moisture in regard of those which inhabite the cold countries. But the regions of the meane temperature are very good and fertile; the people which inhabite there, of meane stature, quicke witted, and well tempered of colour. They are delicate in their maner of liuing, and haue a good sharpe and quick witt, readie to comprehend any thing. And co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly the great Empires and famous monarchies, are in their hands; which are not fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d amongst peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple remoued from this temperature, by reason of their beastly sauagenes, and brutish immanity. Likewise the beasts which are bred in the cold cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries, are lumpish and heauy. And on the contrary, they are light, that are in the hoate regions: the one sort very much differing from the other, both in forme, shape, colours, and properties. The fishes from sea to sea, &amp; the birds from countrey to countrey, do differ much one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thother as may be knowen by the sight of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; vnderstood by the books, which are writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. There is no lesse dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce amongst herbs &amp; trees, according to the place where they are brought forth. For they which grow in the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gings of hils, cold, dry, &amp; exposed to the wind, are of greater vertu, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the others: on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary such as grow on plains
<pb facs="tcp:13829:15"/>
and shadowed places, and waterie, being hid from the wind are not of such efficacy. Also the soile, and season maketh them oft times to shoot forward, or to be backward. We see better trees, fuller of leaues, and better stored with fruit in one territory then in another: because they like the place better. Those trees which loue the hils are very great and faire: as Cedars, Firre trees, pynetrees, boxetrees, and plaintrees: In the Forests, the okes, beeches, corke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees, lotetrees, elmes, ashes, and haseltrees do grow; The alders, poplars, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, and reedes on the riuers sides, and in watrie places. Some come not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny where but in the South Countries; as the orange tree, the citron or lem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon tree, palme or date tree, and the sicamore: Others in the cold Countries as appletrees, and pearetrees. The same difference is found both in herbes, and lesser plants thone not growing but in hot countries, the other in cold, others in those that are meanely temperate. Some grow in marishes, others in stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding waters; There are some which are found ordinarily in moist places, and some in drie; others loue the fieldes, others the vines, and others the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes. Some do better in the vallies, then on the sides of hils; others loue the high places exposed to the winde. There are that finde norishment along the walles of Townes and Castels, and betwixt the closures and ruines of hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. Corne coms better in one place; the vine in another, and cattel in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The aire is so temperate in Calecut, that there is neuer any plague, but continuall greenenes in the herbes and trees, and there are euery moneth new fruits differing altogether from ours, yet good neuerthelesse, and maruelous pleasant. The countrie of Syria chiefely about Damasco, aboundeth with all sort of corne, flesh, and fruit, especially with newe grapes all the yere long; Also pomgranats, quinces, almonds, oliues, and roses of diuers colours, very faire and odoriferous; But their apples, peares, and peaches are of an euil tast. In the west Indies as well throughout the Islands, as in the Maine there are wilde vines that beare good grapes without industry or care of man: But the kernels of the peaches, plums, &amp; cherries, sowen in diuers places there do take no roote. Oliue trees being planted there bring nothing but leaues without fruit. The countrey of Babilon is most fertile in corne; but the vine and figg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree wil not grow there. In Moscouia, there is great abundance of hony and waxe, riche skinnes, and exquisite furres: but not any fruit worth the recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. The Tartarians, and Arabians haue nothing but cattell. The Moluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caes yeeld the aromaticall druggs of spicery, and in all thinges else are barren: In one place are the Emerauds, Rubies, Turkoises and Pearles: In ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is Corrall, Ambor, and Christall; in one place there is gold found; in another lead, tinne, and siluer. Plinie esteeming the wheate of Italie aboue al others, both for whitenesse and waight, saith that nature hath shewed her selfe so friendly towards the Italians, that she hath not onely made them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, in lawes, gouerment of states, and maners of life, customes and fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but also hath giuen them corne, and many other thinges more excelent then they are in other countries. In such maner hath euery countrey his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler gifts, and singularities so distributed by the diuine prouidence, which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:13829:15"/>
is carefull of the vniuersall good of the world, that it cannot perseuer in his perfection without such variety; to the end that the one hauing neede of the other they might communicate togither, &amp; succour ech other.</p>

               </head>
               <p>BVt the Varietie, and alteration is greater in man, then in any other thing; as soone as he is borne he beginneth to dye, and his end dependeth of his beginning. During the time while he liueth from his infancy, euen til his old age, he hath neuer the same things in him, neither is the same: but is stil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, subiect to change as wel in his body, his heare, flesh, bloud, &amp; bones; as in his minde: changing his maners, customes, opinions, appetites, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, sorrowes, feares, and hopes. Wee learne, forget, and remember the sciences. Wee receaue food into our bodies, and cast out the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the waies and conueiances prepared for that purpose: alwaies repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the incommodities of such egestion, by new norishment, and by respira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or breathing of the aire. The little children are foolish, and old men are dotards; others are either alwaies foolish, or now and then at the least. Others become madd, either in continual feuers, or by some other accident: others with too much drinking lose the vse of their reason. Some are naturally more heauy and dull; others more quicke and ingenious; others wiser &amp; bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conditioned: But seeing that they do al participate of one reasonable soule, &amp; haue their bodies made of the selfe same matter; it is a maruel from whence should come such variety, as we see particulerly in euery one from his birth and generally thoroughout the nations. Wherein it seemeth that nature ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth pleasure, to supply the indigence of man, not only producing euery one more apt for one thing then another; as learning, armes, and the other liberal and mechanicall Arts: but also making the people borne in diuers parts of the habitable earth, to differ in inclinations, and complexions.</p>
               <p>MANY learned men haue assaied to render a reason of this so admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a diuersitie. First the natural Philosophers, are of opinion that it procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of the mingling of the fower humours of which mens bodies are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, the which according as they agree, or disagree one with another, do change the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plexions, in disposing the natures diuersly according to their predominant qualities: But principally according to the proportion of the hart, being the fountaine of the vitall spirits, and of the bloud, and gouernor of the affections as it is diuersly affected or altered: also by the disposition of the melancholick humour; which is mother of the arts, and of al good inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; vnto whom they attribute all the dexterity, perseuerance, and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in them. From thence comes it (according to this opinion) that men are merry, sad, dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, slouthful, tractable, opiniatiue, gratious, merciful, enuious, fearful, audatious, foolish, light, wise, true, false, lyers, quarelours, deceauers, with the other like, and ordinary affections of men; more or lesse, according as one humor exceedeth another. To this healpeth much the corrupted estate of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weales, &amp; the talke which is held both openly &amp; secretly, and that
<pb facs="tcp:13829:16"/>
from their youth few do think on remedying of it by good noriture, disciplin, and studies. Whereunto the Physitians do adde eating, and drinking, with exercise, shewing that they are sufficiently seruiceable to the disposition of maners. Besides the waters, windes, and aire enuironing; and that there is great difference in the places which are inhabited: So that commonly the Spaniards are proud and haughty; Egiptians light; Africans disloyal; English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Scots couragious; Greekes crafty and subtill; Italians wise and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; Frenchmen bold and hardy: And thence is it, that amongst the Scithians there was neuer but one Philosopher; and in Athens haue ben many.</p>
               <p>THE ASTROLOGERS affirme all these inferiour natures to be gouerned, and disposed by the superiors, And that by the mouing of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen all things here below, are engendred, and distroyed; or enter changed one into another: Moreouer that by the reuolutions, and influences of the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets assisted with the other starres, there commeth such a diuersitie of bodies and mindes vnto men: some being stirred vp to one action, others moued to another, euen as shippes in the sea by the windes: so that they cannot of them selues either moue or stirre any waies: Likewise the humors of the bodies to be moued by the irradiations of the starres, of whom they receiue diuers dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, which the soule representeth afterward in her actions: Insomuch, that in their opinion, none can learne any art, or disiplin whatsoeuer, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come excellent therein, if he haue not the original, and cause of his excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, from the heauen, and constellations. They say moreouer, that howsoeuer the pouertie, situation, nature, and customes of countries, lawes, and statutes of gouernment, religions, and maners of people do often contrarie their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall destiny; neuerthelesse, that the destiny bee it to good, or euill, doth or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarilye returne to his course, and accommodate it selfe as neere as is possible, to his first order, not denying notwithstanding, but that by good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation and laudable exercises it may greatly be holpen: euen as it commeth to passe in grounds, which by care and diligence are made more fertile: but being left wast, do soone returne to their first nature.</p>
               <p>SOME auncient Philosophers considering, that in the minds of men do appeare the seeds of al disciplines, with some knowledge of God, of vertue, and of vice, without any former teaching, or institution; haue thought, that the reasonable soules were taken and extracted from the Godhead: And that before they came downe from heauen to the earth (which place is contrary to their diuine, and immortall nature) they were full of vniuersall intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and of sciences, which they forgot by the contagion of the body, as soone as they came to dwell therein: But that afterwards by care, study, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise they recouered the remembrance of them: Thinking these first sparkes and faculties of the minde, to be quickned and reuiued againe by learning and vse; which for that respect they called remembrance. That discoursing, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, learning, prouiding, numbring, inuenting, iudging, and other actions of the vnderstanding soule, did not proceed of any elementarie matter in any sort disposed, affected, or ordered by the heauenly bodies; but of a more noble
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:13829:16"/>
and sempiternall coming from without, and being separable from the bodie; as the eternall from the corruptible.</p>
               <p>THE CHRISTIANS, being better instructed in the trueth, haue not sought the cause of this variety, either in complexions or constellations; nor yet posted it ouer to the inconstancy of fortune: but reiecting all such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destiny, fatall necessitie, &amp; hazardous chance, acknowledging truly the world to be gouerned, by the diuine prouidence; and reducing al thereunto do firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeue, that God according to his good pleasure, and one onely Spirite which doth all thinges in all men, distributeth to diuers persons, distinct and different graces, respecting still, the common good, and preseruation of humane society: which cannot endure without many and diuers estates, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, administrations, offices, callings, and workes: in such sort preseruing it selfe by mutuall succour, and reciprocall aide. But that the true vertue, ought chiefly to be required &amp; hoped for of him, without reiecting either natural inclination or good education. And that therefore it behoueth that this natural instinct, of which we haue spoken, should be prouoked and stirred vp by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous institution, which correcteth the ill if there be any, and augmenteth the good in such as are of a good naturall disposition, guiding by wise precepts and counsels, this natural aptnes and inclination vnto true perfection. Since that nothing in the beginning is perfect: but that there goeth alwaies before some toward disposition, and after followeth the accomplishment; As at the point of day breake there is first a certaine glimmering before the light appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth: In trees the bud, and the flower come before the fruit: In corne that is sowen, the blade, and the eare come before the graine. The goodnes of nature alone without discipline is not wel assured, and discipline without na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture altogether vnprofitable. Euen as in tilling of the land to haue good profit therof, it is not enough to haue good grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, but it behoueth also that the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman be skilful in his trade &amp; haue good seed. After to confirme the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both, and to take a good custome which may alwaies remain, perseuerance, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual exercise are requisite, in such workes and actions as concerne that vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation whereunto one is called. As the dyer being desirous to giue some fine dye vnto a cloth which shal long time keepe his colour, doth first wash it and prepare it carefully, and after dyeth it againe and againe: So to the obtaining of perdurable praise in any calling wee must vse necessarie preparatiues, and euen from our youth imprint vertue in our hartes, and our manners by dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent instruction; that it may long remaine with vs. These meanes are seldome found altogether: but where they meete fitly and agreably they make men accomplished, and admirable, such as those haue ben in times past, which at this day wee so highly commend and esteeme. Such are the opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the varietie which is amongst men; hauing all of them a great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parance of trueth: But heere wee will followe the celestiall and naturall as the most common, and that which Ptolomey writeth thereof in these wordes. The properties of people (sayth hee) haue vsually been distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed either by all Parallels and all Angles, or by their scituation towardes

the Ecliptique and the sunne. For the inhabitants of our land situated in an aquilonarie quadrant, which are subiect to Souther parellels; that is to say, which are described by the equinoctial vnto the tropique of Sommer; as the sunne goeth ouer them, their bodies are blacke and in a manner burnt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, their heire thicke and curled, their faces scorched: they are slender of sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, hot of nature, and cruel of disposition by reason of the great heat which raigneth in their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey. We cal the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ethiopians being so disposed as we haue said, and hauing such constitution of aire, wherein do agree with them all the liuing creatures, and things growing of that Countrey. But those which are vnder Aquilonarie Parallels, that is to say, which inhabite such places as are vnder the North, because their vertical point is farre remoued from the Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diack, and from the heat of the sunne, they abound in cold and moisture: in which there is much nourishment which is not drawen vp by the said heat. By meanes whereof the men there are white of colour, with long haire; great of stature, and well made: but of cold nature, and cruel maners through the vehement cold of those places. The sharpnes of winter is agreable here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto and the greatnes of all thinges which growe out of the earth, and the wildnes of their beasts, we call them generally Scythians. Touching them which inhabite betweene the Tropique of Sommer and the North, because the sunne goeth not on their Zenith, nor yet to farr towards the South, they liue in a very temperate aire, ioyning their houses together, &amp; being of gentle, and sweete maners. And such of them as are neerest the South are most inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, and wise, and haue accustomed to be best skilled in heauenly matters, for asmuch as their vertical point is nearer the Zodiacke, and the wandering starres which are vnder it: by the familiaritie of which, they haue their minds prompt, &amp; readie for the comprehending and vnderstanding of affaires, &amp; of arts; especially of the Mathematickes. Also such of them as are toward the East, are more vigorous and firme of vnderstanding, concealing nothing. For by right wee say that the East is of the nature of the sunne: and therefore that part of the day ought to be esteemed as the right side, the better, and more manlike; as we see in liuing creatures, the right side to be stronger and harder then the left. On the contrarie they which are towards the west are more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminate, soft and secret; for that part belongeth vnto the Moone, which is seene alwaies towards the west betweene the interlunary spaces: And therfore as the nocturnal, worst and left side is reputed opposite vnto the East. Aristotle affirmeth that those nations are barbarous which dwel vnder excessiue cold or heat, for as much as the good temperature of the aire doth better both the manners and vnderstandings. For the extreme Northern or Southern people are not ciuil by nature, nor gouerned by discipline, nor conioyned in habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, neither do they sowe nor plant; helpe themselues little or nothing with manuary trades; exchange in their bargaining one thing for another; not knowing the vse of money: but liuing without houses, townes, and cities; wandering continually by great troupes representing great walking Cities, guyded by diuers heads and Lords, and trailing or drawing after them their
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:13829:17"/>
little lodges, or houels, couered with leather, mattes, canes, or course wooll, to defend them selues against heat, cold, and raine. And without long abode in any place, they follow the commodities of the herbage, and water for their beasts and cattel, which they bring with them innumerable of diuers sortes; as Horses, Camels, Sheepe, and Kine; wherewith they sustayne them selues, and with venyson: being destitute of Corne, herbes, and fruits. Such were, of auncient time in the Northern Countries the Scythians, and Sarmatians, or Sauromatians dwelling in fields or Champaignes infinitely large, and spaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, open, without wood, trees, or bushes, without waies or bounds, on Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots whereon they placed their wiues, and children, which were therhence called Nomades, and Hamaxobites. Being ignorant of till age they nourished them selues with flesh and with milke, their land, which was plaine and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted being fit for such maner of liuing, and being holpen by sundry great riuers which running ouerthwart and watering the ground, made it fat and fertill. Vnto which Scythians, the Tartarians, haue succeeded liuing at this day (as is said) in the same manner. Out of this quarter and this kind of people neuer came but two Philosophers, Anacharsis, and Zamolsis, both of them brought vp elswhere: how be it that in Greece there haue bin innumerable.</p>
               <p>ON THE other part, towards the south were the Numidians, liuing in the open aire without houses, alwaies in labour and trauaile, not drinking any wine, and faring simply and poorely, seeking onely to satisfie nature, and not to serue pleasure. Who by reason here of were very strong, whole, lusty, and able men, and long liued. The Arabians or Alarbians liue nowe in such manner sithence the comming of Mahomet, leading with them their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, villages, and townes which they carry on Chariots; or on the backe of Camels, following the commoditie of pasturage from Arabie, and the riuer Euphrates, euen to the Atlanticke sea, being very hurtfull to the bordering plaines of Suria, Egipt, and all the neerer Africke: especially about the time of gathering corne, and fruits, for they goe downe then by troupes close, and thicke: Then hauing taken what they can, they retire with such swiftnesse that they seeme rather to flie, then to run: and it is not possible to ouertake them, or to follow them thorough places destitute of waters. It is a vagabond people and innumerable, yet diurded by Nations, and Lordes, called <hi>Schez</hi> euil agreeing togither, and hauing no firme habitation: They dwel common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnder tents and pauilions made of course &amp; bad wool; They liue with flesh and milke especially of Camels, putting thereunto a little rice, hony, dates, raisins, drie figgs, oliues, and Venison when they can catch it, going often with doggs and haukes, to hunt red deare, fallow deare, Ostriches, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sort of wild game. They are commonly mishapen, maigre, and leane, of small stature, of tawny, and duskish colour, blacke eyed, with a weake and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine voice; wearing no other garments but shirts, sauing some chief of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. They ride the most part, without sadles, spurs, or shoes on their horses. Their armes are great India canes of x. or xij. cubits long, with a little yron at the end, and a little taffeta in manner of a banderoll. Notwithstanding liuing in this
<pb facs="tcp:13829:18"/>
pouertie and miserie, they glory that they are first nations and chiefe of the world, in that they were neuer mingled with others, and haue still preserued and kept entier the nobility of their blood. Ioannes Leo an Affrican historio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grapher writeth that they haue many goodly obseruations of Astrology, which by tradition they deliuer from hand to hand to their successours, and increase them daily.</p>
               <p>BVT those nations which are in the meane habitatio of the world, are well disposed, and instructed both in armes and learning: hauing by nature both courage and vnderstanding togither. They liue in good policy, inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting houses, hamlets, parishes, villages, townes, cities, common weales, king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and Empires: they haue vniuersities, and publicke schooles, in which all sciences are taught; they haue variety of trads and occupations, seruing not only for necessity, but also for pleasure, ornament, and magnificence of buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, victuals, habits, and armes; they haue iudgement, reuenew, warfare, and religion wel appointed, and maintained.</p>
               <p>AMONGST these of the meane, they which dwell neerest the South being naturally melancolick do giue themselues willingly to solytarines, and contemplation, being sharpe witted and ingenious: as the Egiptians, Lybi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Hebrewes, Arabians, Phaenicians, Assyrians, Persians, and Indians. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they haue inuented many goodly sciences, vnfolded the secrets of nature, found out the Mathematickes, obserued the celestial motions, &amp; first knowen religion. Amongst them haue bin found learned Philosophers, diuine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and famous Lawmakers.</p>
               <p>THEY which drawe towards the North, as the Almains, thorough the abundance of humour and blood (which doth hinder speculation) do apply themselues more to sensible things and to Mechanical arts, that is to say, to the finding of mettals, and conduct of mines, to melt and forge workes in yron, steele, copper, &amp; brasse, in which they are admirable; hauing inuented the vse of Ordinance, Artillery and Printing.</p>
               <p>THOSE which dwel in the very midst, are not so naturally fit for the speculatiue sciences, as the Southern nations, nor so apt for the mechanicall workes as the Northern people are; but are best seene in handling publicke affaires; and from them are come many good institutions, Lawes, maners, the art of gouernment or Imperial, military discipline, and politicke ordering of a common wealth, the regiment of a Shipp or Pilots art, Logike, and Rhetoricke. And as the Meridional nations haue not bin much exercised in armes, nor the Septentrional in learning, thone excelling in vnderstanding, thother in force; they of the meane being both ingenious, and courageous, embracing both letters, and armes together, and ioyning force with wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, haue established flourishing, and durable Empires, which the other could not do; for although the Gothes, Hunnes, and Vandales, more hardie then wise, haue by armes inuaded Europe, Asia, and Africke, neuertheles for want of Counsell they established not any power of continuance. Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rywise the Romains being both valiant and prudent, haue surmounted
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:13829:18"/>
all nations by the glory of their decdes, establishing the greatest Empire and of longest continuance that euer was. And yet haue not been depriued of the excellency of disciplines, or of mechanicall workes. Amongst whom haue florished famous Captaines, good Lawmakers, learned Lawiers, iust Iudges, seuere Censors, graue Senatours, ingenious and pleasant Poets, elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Oratours, true and elegant Historiographers, wary Marchants, and exquisite Artificers.</p>
               <p>CONCERNING the East and West, all doe agree, that the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ental or Easterly situation, in the same aspect of heauen, and seated in the like place, is better then the Westerly or Occidentall and that all thinges growe fairer, and greater in thone then thother. Notwithstanding we see the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterne people to excell in force of body: and the others in vigour and sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of vnderstanding. In so much that the West seemeth to haue some affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie with the North, and the East with the South. The Gaules or French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men haue often sent great armies into Italy, Greece, and Asia: The Italians ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ouercame France till they brought their Empire to his full heigth and force, and that vnder Iulius Caesar who founde them deuided into factions. The Italians ouercame the Grecians without great difficulty. The Grecians who by their armes had penetrated into the farther Asia, came not farre into Italy, but vnder King Pyrrhus who was shamfully beaten back. Xerxes came downe into Greece with an innumerable armie, yet neuerthelesse was ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by a fewe Grecians, and driuen backe againe with a reprochful, and ignominious losse.</p>
               <p>INREGARD of the parts of the habitable earth, many excellent men of war haue ben renowmed in Europe, few in Africk, fewer in Asia: which is come to passe, by reason that these two last parts of the world haue had one or two soueraignties, but few co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weales. But Europe hath only had certain kingdoms, but infinite co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weals. Men become excellent, &amp; make shew of their vertue, according as they are employed &amp; aduanced by their Prince, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth. It is the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> likly that where are many potentats, there wil also be found many valiant men: and fewe, where there are but few potentats. In A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia are found Ninus, Cyrus, Darius, Artaxerxes, Mithridates, and a few others to beare them company. In Africke are named (leauing out the antiquitie of Egipt) Masinissa, Iugurtha, and the Captains bred by the common wealth of Carthage: the which yet in respect of Europe are but few; For asmuch as there are excellent ones in Europe without number, and more would be, if those other were named which by the malignity of the time are forgotten. For the world hath ben there most vertuous, where there haue ben most great estates fauourers of vertue; either for necessitie; or some other humane passion. There haue ben therefore few excellent men in Asia, because that prouince was wholy vnder one kingdome, which by the greatnes thereof remaining for the most part idle, they could not there become excellent men for managing of affaires. The same is also in Africk where likewise there haue bin few, saue only in the common wealth of Carthage. This being also obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
<pb facs="tcp:13829:19"/>
that there are more excellent personages found in common weales, then in kingdoms; in the which vertue is honoured, and in kingdomes suppressed: whence cometh to passe that in a common wealth the vertuous are cherished, and in a kingdome not regarded.</p>
               <p>Wherefore he that shall consider Europe shall finde it to haue bin full of common weales, and principalities, which for the feare they had one of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, were constrained to keepe in vigour the military orders; and to honour, and esteeme of such as were best skilled therin. For in Greece besids the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Macedony there were many common weales, &amp; in euery of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were bred most excellent men; In Italy were the Romains, Samnites, Toscans, and Gaules Cisalpins; France, and Germany were ful of common weales &amp; prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: likewise Spaine. And although in comparison of the Romains there are few others named; that coms to pas by the malignity of writers, which follow fortune, and honour none but the vanquishers: But it seemeth not likely that amongst the Samnites, and Toscans which maintained warres 150. yeres a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the people of Rome, before they were ouercome, there were not many excellent men; and likewise in France and Spaine. But that vertue which the writers do not celebrate in particuler men, they extoll generally in the whole nations; exalting euen vnto heauen their obstinate defending of their liberty. It being true then, that where are most estates, there arise most valiant men, It followeth necessarily that where there are fewest, there vertue from hand to ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d diminisheth: because there remaineth lest occasion to make me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vertuous.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the Empire being since increased, and hauing extinguished all the common weales and Seigniories of Europe, and Africke, and the greatest part of those of Asia; it left no way nor meanes vnto vertue any where but at Rome; so that there began to be few excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t men in Europe, as in Asia; which vertue came since euen to his last ouerthrow; forasmuch as all vertue being reduced vnto Rome; when it was once corrupted, euen almost all the world came to corruption therewith. And the Northren nations were of power to come, and spoile this Empire, which had extinguished the light of others vertue, and could not maintaine his owne. Although then that by the inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of these barbarous nations, it was diuided into many parts; yet the former vertue could not yet spring vp againe, by reason of the difficulty which there is for a time to resume the former orders being ouerthrowen; &amp; also because the maner of liuing at this day (considering the christian religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) doth not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posethe same necessity of defending our selues, which was in ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t time. For then, those me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that were ouer come in war were either slain, or els remained in perpetual bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dage, leading a miserable life: The conquered la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds were left deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, or els they draue the inhabita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, being spoiled of their goods, like fugitiues throughout the world. Insomuch that those which in wars were ouercome endured al extremity of misery. Being moued with this fear, me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alwaies held military exercise in vigour, &amp; honored such as excelled therein. But at this day this feare for the most part is taken away: for there are few of the vanquished slaine, &amp; they remaine not long prisoners, the way being easy to deliuer them.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:13829:19"/>
And although Cities should a thousand times reuolte, yet are they not destroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but the men enioy their goods; and the greatest euil they feare is an impost or taxe: wherefore they will not submit themselues to the military orders, and entirely beare the charges of the warre, to preuent these dangers, which they do not much feare; since the prouinces of Europe are reduced to so fewe heads in respect of the time past: All France being subiect to one king, Spaine to another, and Italy diuided into partes. In such sort, that the weake Cities are saued by associating them selues with the vanquishers; and the other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states by the foresaid reasons do not feare their vtter ouerthrow. Touching the Almaines and Switzers, because there were amongst them many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealths, and Seigniories, being iealous of their estates, and constrained to maintain them by exercise of armes, they haue brought forth whatsoeuer is good at this day in Military discipline, in these parts. Moreouer men in their food and norishment, are no lesse different, according to the diuersity of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries then in other things; eche countrey hauing his peculiar meates, and a seueral kinde of dressing, preparing, sauouring, saulcing, rosting, and boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them: And in eche season of the yere nature yeldeth newe meates both by sea and land. As then there are found diuers sorts of food; so are there also diuers maners of liuing, both of beasts, and of men. For being not possible for them to liue without nourishment, the difference thereof maketh their maner of liuing to be diuers, and different. So that of beastes, some liue in heards and flockes; other seperated here and there, as is most expedient for purchase of their liuing: And some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> feed on liuing creatures, others on fruits, others on euery thing; so that nature hath seuered their liues according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity and choice of these things. But for as much as naturally euery creature hath not pleasure in the selfe same, but some delight in one thing and some in another: for this cause doe the liues of them differ which eate liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and which feed on fruits. Likewise there is a great difference betweene the liues of men; The Idler sort giue them selues to pasturage, feeding on tame beasts, without paines; or trauaile: but because it is needfull for them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue their cattaile from place to place for pasture, they are constrained to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, exercising as it were a liuely kind of husbandry. Some liue on hunting in diuers sorts: as some on their pray; others on fishing, as they which liue neere vnto lakes, pondes, and riuers; and such as border on the sea; others on birds, and wild beasts, which inhabite neere vnto the woodes; The poore thoroughout the wide forests, and high mountaines, liue on roots, akornes, and wildfruits: notwithstanding the greatest part of men liue of the earth, and of such fruits as they finde at home. So that the manners of liuing vsed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, are pasturage, tillage, hunting, hauking, fishing, and fouling. Others by mingling of these do liue better at ease, helping their life (which hath need of many things) with that which it wanteth, to thend to haue suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient: As some vse pasturage and hauking, others ioyne tillage with hunting; and so the other kinds of liuing according as necessitie constraineth them, or delight and pleasure prouoketh them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13829:20"/>The Canibals euen at this day do eate mans flesh rosted; likewise the other Sauages eate their enimies which they haue taken in wars: The Arabians feed on Camels, and Ostriches, bread of Millet and rapeseed pilled. The Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians on raw flesh indifferently, of dogs, horses, cats, snakes, and such other beasts: which they do only presse betweene two stones to draw out the bloud thereof, or els do mortifie it on the backe of a horse when a man is on him. They drinke mares milke, preparing it in such sort that it resembleth white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine, &amp; it is not much vnsauoury, nor of ill tast: The Cathayans also eate raw flesh, cutting it first in small peeces, then they conserue it in odoriferous oyles, with good spices, and then do eate if so prepared. Their drink is made of rice, with diuers spices; which hath a tast more delicious &amp; pleasant then wine, and they which drink more then enough thereof, are sooner drunk then with wine. The Medites hauing neither corne nor wine, vse great hunting in the summer time, &amp; taking both of wild beasts, and birds: wherof they make their prouision to liue in winter. And in some places they make bisket of fishes, dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and cut in smal peeces, which they beate, and bray into powder or flower, then they temper it with water, make past thereof, mould it, and make it into loaues of bread, which they dry in the sunne; &amp; liue thereof all the yere. The people of Calecut liue on rice, fishes, spices, &amp; fruits altogether different from ours. They drinke wine of palmes, and of dates mingled with rice, and sugar. Throughout al the western Islands they make bread of a kind of wheat called Mahiz, and of a roote named Iuca: which are ordinary feeding aswel in the Islands, as in the maine land. They make drinke of certain Pine apples which the call Ya yama, which is holsome; but because it is to sweet, it is not so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant to drinke as the drinke of our countries. It would be too long, &amp; tedious, to recite here and set downe seuerally all the kinds of liuing, receiued of men either for necessitie, or for superfluitie, and delights.</p>
               <p>Therfore these already rehearsed as the most strange, and most different from ours shal suffice at this time. But besides the commodities and discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of liuing, which men haue in their seuerall Countries; some abstain from certaine meates, either by opinion, as the Pythagoreans did, from a cow, and from a beane: or els by religion; and that either for a time; as from flesh in Lent, and on fasting daies amongst the Christians; or alwaies, as the Charterhouse Monkes, and Carthusian Friers. On the contrary the auncient priests of Egipt, thought it a great sin to eate fishe, as Herodotus hath wrtiten. The Egiptians abstained also from swines-flesh, as the Iews do at this day, and the Mahometans, who moreouer wil drinke no wine: The Malharbians, and Guzeras do eate nothing that hath blood, neither kil they any thing that hath life: Therefore they neither eate greene herbes nor newe fruit, thinking that there is life in them, and that it is a great offence to make them die: They wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship Oxen, and abstaine from eating them as the Iewes do from swine: The others being not so scrupulous do vse indifferently all kind of meates which they can comeby.</p>

               <p>IT seemeth that there is in men some natural desire to chaunge their habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and dwellings; hauing a mutable mind, impacient of rest, and desirous of nouelties: By reason whereof, they cease not from going one to an other, changing of maners, tongues, letters, lordships, and religions: Few countries are inhabited by the true originaries: almost all Nations are mingled. In auncient time the Egyptians dwelt in Babylon, Cholchis, Syria, and Greece; The Grecians in that part of Italie, which is next the lower sea; the Tyrians in Afrike; the Africans in Spaine; the Phocians in Gaule; the Gaules in Greece, and Asia; the Macedonians in Syria, and Egipt: So haue the Arabians past into Persia, Syria, Afrike, Italie, and Spaine: So the Tartarians into Scythia: So the Spaniards into America, to Peru, and into the East, and West India: The excessiue heates, and coldes, the deepe seas, and large riuers, the high mountaines, the great woodes, and deserts, can not let them from changing their dwellinges: Notwithstanding, they remoue commonly out of cold Regions into temperate; as the Parthians and Turks haue done on the side of Asia; and in Europe the Cymbrians, Sicambrians, Saxons, Gothes, Lombards, Burgundians, Frenchmen, Vandales, Normans, Alanes, Hunnes, Hungarians, and Slauonians: which at diuers times going out of the North, haue possessed the principall regions of Europe. Others hauing long straied and wandered, do not make choise of their habitation, but stay at the first place where they find themselues wearle; being not able to go any farther: Others get it by force of armes: Some straiers perish bythe way; others dwell where their pouertie leaueth them; and they haue not all the same necessitie to abandon their Countrie, and to seek a new.

Howsoeuer; all vsurpers haue accustomed, to abolysh as much as lay in them, the dignitie, and memorie of their predecessors, aswell for enuie, hatred, and contempt, as for ambition, to thend to make their name onely from that time forward to flourish: as the Medians did, vsurping the Lordship ouer the Assyrians; the Persians ouer the Medes, and Egiptians; the Romains ouer the Gaules, Spaniards, and Africans; the Gothes and Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dales ouer the Romains; the Arabians ouer the Persians, Egiptians, &amp; Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans: which at this day also the Spaniards do in the new found Lands; and the Turks in those places which they get on the Christians; destroying their buildings, titles, letters, bookes, histories, and sciences.</p>

Yf the vertue of commaunders were alwaies alike, the affaires of men would go better, and more certainlie without being transported to and fro, and incessantly altered; for aucthoritie is easilie maintayned by the same meanes, by which it is gotten: but where for diligence idlenes; for conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie and equitie, couetousnes and pride do take place: there the fortune chaungeth with the maner of their lyuing. Wherefore the Kingdoms and Empires are translated continually from the lesse apt and able, to those that more; chaunging from familie to familie, and from nation to nation; As by

               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OD creating Man, gaue him for a great and excellent gift, the vse of Reason, and Speech; and by these two prerogatiues hath separated him from other Creatures: But reason would little helpe him, and would lesse ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in him, if he could not by speech expresse that which before hee had conceiued in his mind; for the beastes seeme to yeeld vnto him rather in speech then vnderstanding; doing finely and curiously many workes which he can not imitate: which because they can not speake, are called mute or dumbe, and vnreasonable creatures. And although men are more sociable, yet little would the similitude of nature which is amongst them, auaile them vnto this societie, if they did not vnderstand one an other; and would rather chuse to conuerse with the dumbe creatures, of diuers kinds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then with other strange men which they vnderstand not. Speech then being so necessarie to a ciuil man; who by reason alone can not haue the companie of an other, and being naturally giuen him to declare the conceits and affections of his mind; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding it commeth to passe, that the words are not alwaies, and euery where the same, as the thinges are vnto which they are imposed: but do chaunge from countrie to countrie, and from time to time; according to the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:13829:22"/>
vse and custome of those that speake; beeing receiued, and vnderstood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them by their owne agreement, and consent: From whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth this varietie of Languages amongst men dispersed ouer the whole habitable earth, being so spacious in length, and bredth, thone not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing thother but by signes, or interpreters. But if, as there is in all men one first principle of reason, and one common interiour intelligence, it were possible that there were also but one common tongue to serue in arts, and contracts; they would loue one another better, by the ceasing of that discord, which commeth by the diuersitie, and ignorance of tongues; and employ that time in knowledge of things, which they are now constrained to bestow in learning of words. Diodorus the Sicilian following the auncient Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers hath written, that men at the beginning had the sound of their voice confused, and not to be vnderstood; but that by little and little, making dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, they named euery thing by his name: And for asmuch as they were then dwelling in diuers partes of the world, they did not vse all one speach and language; whence it came to passe, that they had also different Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and letters. Moses declareth in Genesis, how the language of all the earth was confounded in the building of the tower of Babel; wherehence hath proceeded the diuision of Nations, and the beginning of the diuersitie of Tongues, by the pride and presumption of men. As in trueth it is a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment for sinne that we haue so many, which are changed vncessantly at the pleasure of the common people, forging daily new words; by the birth of which the former must needes decay: Euen as the seasons of the yeare do spoile the earth of her flowers and fruites; and do after cloath it a new with others. Likewise time maketh words to fall; and vse maketh new to spring in their places, and graceth them, making them to be in request; vntill that, being by age consumed by little and little, they come also to die: because that in the end, both we, and all things that are ours are mortall. But such change and varietie commeth ordinarily of the mingling of diuers Nations, and of great faires, and armies; where are people of diuers languages, who assembling, and communing together, do continually forge new wordes; which do either endure, or perish, according as of custome they are accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or reiected.</p>
            <p>And howbeit that speech is natural vnto men, yet do they not speake but artificially; nor do they learne it, but in hearing others speake: first their mothers, and their nurses; and afterwards the common people. Wherefore it behoueth, that the first which imposed names on things, hauing no other of whom they might learne them, did miraculously learne them in that tongue, wherein the nature, and trueth of things agreed with their originals, and Etimologies: which men euen to this present haue endeuoured to seeke in all tongues, in the significations of words. The Hebrewes attribute this honour to their tongue, which they account the first and most auncient of the world. Herodotus writeth, that Psamneticus King of Egipt, being desirous to know which was the first language, gaue two young children of poore parentage
<pb facs="tcp:13829:23"/>
to a Shepheard to be kept, forbidding any word to be spoken in their hearing: but commaunded they should be kept a sunder; and that at certaine howers there should goates be brought to giue them suck: which he did for a desire he had to heare what word these children would speake first: And it hapned after two yeares, when the Shepheard opened the doore to come in to the children, they fell downe both at his feete, and holding vp their handes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced this word, <hi>Bec,</hi> which is as much to say as Bread, in the Phrygian tongues. And so it was found, that the Phrygians were more auncient then the Egyptians, and their language the first. Vitruuius the Architect, speaking somewhat grossely of this matter, saith, that while men dwelt yet in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restes, in some of the thickest places, the trees shaken by the force of the windes, and beating violently one against an other, stroke fire, wherat those that were neere being astonished, fled; and afterwards comming neere again, when the noise was stilled, they found that great commoditie came to the bodie by the heat of the fire; and putting wood into it, so maintayning it, they called the rest, and shewed vnto them by signes, the good that came of it: In this first assemblie, their voices issuing diuersly out of their brests, the words were made as they offred themselues, by the which signifying oft the same things, they began to speak at aduenture; &amp; so formed the languages amongst them. Pythagoras did attribute soueraine wisdom to him which first found out names for euery thing. And Plato affirmeth in his Cratilus, that it was done by a power, more then humaine: for in trueth man could not of him selfe, without the helpe of God discerne innumerable thinges contained in the world by their proper names, which otherwaies had remained vnkno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen: I say, the Heauen, his parts, and mouings; the fixed, and wandering Starres; the Elements with their qualities; wyndes, raines, haile, snowes, thunders, and other meteors; birds, beasts, fishes, herbs, plants, trees, graines, minerals, stones, pearles, their natures and properties; seas, gulfes, climates, hauens, ports, isles, riuers, lakes, pooles, lands, countries, people, nations, vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, hamlets, townes, and cities: The inward and outward partes of the bodie; sences, and their obiects; odours, sauours, smels, and tasts; maladies, and their remedies; infinite humaine actions; victuals, garments, lawes, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, iudgments, gouernments, ceremonies, warfare, reuenewes, moneies: so many arts and occupations with their instruments: so many persons with names, and surnames, the affinities and alliances betwixt them. The contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie also in times past hath bin great amongst the learned, whether words were imposed at the will and pleasure of them that speake, or els by art, and natural reason. The varietie and continuall mutation which is seen in ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, made some think that this imposition was casual, and arbitrarie, foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the consent and custom of men: Others said, that sithence the names are as instruments ordained to present things vnto vs, which do not chaunge thorough our opinions; but according to their nature remaine alwaies in the same order; also that the true names did not chaunge after our pleasure: but were agreeable to the things signified, whose essence, and similitude they
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:13829:23"/>
did imitate; being first conceiued in mind, afterwards expressed in sound, and voice, and then written by letters and sillables. Which opinion some haue so farre beleeued, that they haue gone about to enquire, and search out the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie of things, by the proprietie of words; and to insinuate so far, by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret vertue which they deemed in them, as to do miracles in pronouncing them; and to heale the diseases both of bodie and mind therwith: And that which is more, they haue affirmed, that there are some inuented by diuine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration, meaning amongst others the name of GOD, which is pronounced by fower letters onely in most languages: In which they say so manie Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons could not agree, without some maruailous mysterie of the diuinitie.</p>
            <p>If the imposition, propertie, and vertue of names be admirable, the inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and vse of Letters is no lesse; and to haue found a mean to comprehend in a few notes, such a multitude, and varietie of sounds, and voices of men. By them are written the things of greatest profit vnto the world; as the lawes, sentences of Iudges, testaments, contracts, and other such things necessarie for the vnderstanding of the life of man: Those which haue bin long time dead, are reuiued in the memorie of the lyuing; and they which are many miles distant a sunder, commune with their absent friends, as if they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent: The sacred Bookes of the holie Scripture, and word of God, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued by them; the sentences of wise men, philosophy, and generally all sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are deliuered ouer from hand to hand to the suruiuors. Some haue ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiled at this inuention, as Thames king of Egipt (in Platoes Phaedrus) who made answere to Theut (boasting himself therof) that he had not found, a remedie or help for memory, but for remembrance. Therfore, the Pythagore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and the French Druydes did write nothing; but deliuered one to another their mysteries without writing; to thend that they should not exercise their memorie the lesse, thorough the confidence of letters: Notwithstanding, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience (which is Mistres of things) hath manifestly opened their errour; for asmuch as by writing nothing, the memorie of their doctrine in processe of yeares thorough mans imbecillitie is vtterly lost, no apparance, or auncient mark therof remayning at this day.</p>
            <p>In like maner the Hebrewes say of their Cabal, that it was first giuen by God to the Patriarches, and to Moises, afterwards to the Prophets: not written, but reuealed successiuely, and giuen from hand to hand, by the one to the other. But after they were deliuered from the Captiuitie of Babylon by Cyrus, and that vnder Zorobabel they had reedified the Temple: then Esdras who alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die had restored the books of Moises, fore-seeing, that his nation amongst so many calamities, flights, banishments, and mortalities, vnto which it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed; could not at length preserue and keepe the secreats of that celestial doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine reuealed to them from aboue, and preferred before the written Law; except they did write them: he gathered what he could of the wise men then suruiuing, and reduced it into seuentie Volumes.</p>
            <p>Letters then being most necessarie; after they were inuented, they which considered them neerest, diuided them into Vowels, and Consonants; then
<pb facs="tcp:13829:24"/>
into halfe vowels, mutes, and liquids: calling that art Grammer, which serued to know, to discerne, and to assemble them; to make sillables, nounes, verbs, and speach. And although Plinie, building on the authoritie of Epigenes, thinketh the vse of letters to haue bin eternal (that is to say, without begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) neuertheles, he is gainsaid in that, by other Authors. Philo the Iew im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth the inuention of the Hebrew letters to Abraham; Eusebius to Moises; and others vnto Esdras. Iosephus saith, that the children of Seth, the sonne of Adam, erected two Pillars, the one of stone, thother of earth, in the which they wrote the arts inuented by them: and that thone of stone was yet in his time remayning in Syria. Cicero attributeth the Egiptian letters to Mercury, and the Phrygian to Hercules. Liuie ascribeth the Latin to Euander the Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, whom he calleth venerable by the miracle of letters. Cor. Tacitus the Hetrurian letters to Demaratus the Corinthian: The Slauonians attribute theirs to S. Iherome, who they say translated into their tongue, the old &amp; new Testament. The Bishop Gordian gaue letters to the Gothes. The auncient Frenchmen which first possessed both the Gauls, had three sorts of letters, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering thone from thother: The first inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted by Wastald; the other by Dorac; the third by Hiche. The Normans had theirs also described by Bede. In like maner many Nations haue inuented new Characters, haue changed, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the old; as the Slauons those of the Greeks; the Armenia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees; the Chaldees of the Hebrewes; the Gothes, Lombards, Spaniards, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, and Frenchmen those of the Romains. The other Hetrurian letters which are seen yet at this day in the ancient sepulchers, are altogether vnkno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen: Others searching the same yet more deeply, and fetching it farther off, affime that they were first inuented by the Ethiopians, who deliuered them to the Egiptians; the Egiptians to the Assyrians; the Assyrians to the Phenicians; the Phenicians to the Pelagians; the Pelagians to the Latins; the Latins to the Italians, Frenchmen, Spaniards, Almains, Englishmen, Scots, Noruegians, Suecians, Polacques, and Hungarians.</p>
            <p>The Characters of the letters are no lesse different then the tongues; &amp; can not serue any tongue but that wherunto they were ordayned; nor represent the entier, &amp; natural pronunciation, no, not of their owne; which changeth not onely from towne to towne, but almost from village to village; for Greek could not be written in Latin letters, nor the Latin in Greek letters: and the Greeks and Latins do not alwaies pronounce as they write; but to make the sound of their words softer, do change the pronounciation of some letters, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thone for thother: whereof ther is a complaint made in Lucian to the iudgment of the vowels. Suetonius writeth of Augustus, that he obserued not the Ortographie set down by the Gramarians, but seem rather to leane to the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of those, which think that we ought to writ as we speak: In the which howbeit he were followed, yet could he not with his imperial authority, and inestimable power preuaile against custome: And therfore I wonder at some Frenchmen, who not considering that in Grammer, there is more obseruation the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; &amp; that it behoueth in such things as are speking, writing, &amp; pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, with nature to mingle custom (which as Quint. saith, is the most certain
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:13829:24"/>
Mistresse thereof) haue of late intruded themselues, assaying to reduce the writing of that language (which they haue cleane turned vp-side downe) wholie to the pronunciation; without thinking that the French doe vse straunge letters; which if they could neuer thoroughly satisfie their owne tongue, but because of their defect haue bin often changed, and augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; how should they then satisfie another? In somuch that it seemeth to some to bee a thing impossible, that a people hauing a peculier tongue of their owne should vse strange letters, but with great difficultie; as we see in the Dutch and English, vsing Latin letters; and in the Turke, and Persian, which vse the Arabian. As also they are of opinion, that the historie of one Nation, can not conueniently be written in another language, then that of the same countrie; induced to think so by the Romain historie, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing written in Greeke, seemeth no more to be Romain: especially where there is question of customs, lawes, magistrates, moneyes, reuenewes, and ceremonies: wherein the Greeke tongue being otherwise rich and plentiful, seemeth rude, &amp; barbarous; where the latin is fine and eloquent. The same is befalne to the Greek Historie, written in the Latin tongue: and likewise to the French made by Gaguinus, Paulus Emilius, and others, representing lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and ill to the purpose, the affaires of Fraunce in a strange language, vsed onely now a daies in schooles: whereas Froissard, Monstrellet, Phillip de Commines, Guill. and Martin du Bellay, are found large and conuenient. But to thend not to digresse from our commenced purpose, I will returne to speake of Letters. The Hebrewes and Latines haue twentie and two; The Slauons, and Iacobites two and thirtie; The Armenians 38; The Abissins or Ethiopians 47; The Arabians 31; The Chaldeans 28: The Latins, Greeks, and other inhabitants of Europe, and the Indians of Malabar, hauing pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar letters of their owne, do write from the left side towards the right; The Hebrewes, Chaldees, Arabians, and generally all the Asiatickes, and Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, from the right to the left, imitating the mouing of the Heauen, which is from the right hand to the left, and is most perfect according to Aristotle, approching neerest to the vnitie, which of Plato is called the motion of simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, or of vniformity; The Cathayans, or people of China, &amp; Iapania, from aboue downe-wards, saying that therein they follow the order of nature, which hath giuen to men their heads placed aboue, and their feete below. Diodorus the Sicilian writeth, that in a certaine Island found towards the South by Iambolus, thinhabitants did not write from one side to thother as we do, but drew their lyne straight from aboue downwards, hauing 28<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in number, according to the signification which they giue them. Other maners of writing there can not be; except one would write a crosse, or ouerthwart. The Eastern, and Southern nations do vse points; the Greekes their abbreuiations; the Latines their titles; the Egiptians in holy things did vse the figures of beastes for letters, which they called Hierogliphicks. The most Auncients did write, in the rynde or barke of trees, and in tables, and leaues of wood: others in Palm-leaues, according to the commoditie of their
<pb facs="tcp:13829:25"/>
countrey; others in lead. Their missiue letters, or Epistles were written in tables or waxe; the Lawes, and other durable things were engrauen in brasse, or copper: They did write also in fine linnen cloth. Themperor Commodus vsed the fine bark of the Linden tree, called of the Latins Tylia, or Philyra: Others the rynds of a little tree called Papyrus, (growing in the marishes of Egipt) which were thicker: from whence came the name of Paper vsed at this present: which is made of old raggs of cloth, steeped along time in water, and braied in the mill; after brought into a kind of past, which being stretched out on a gredyron of brasse, to thend to drie it, &amp; being put betwen locks of woll, and pressed; after it is a little dried, becommeth fine, smooth, thin, &amp; white pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: we vse Parchmin also more strong, &amp; durable then paper, which is made of sheepskins, goatskins, and calueskins, coried and dressed by the Leather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressers, and parchminmakers. Herodotus in his Terpsichore witnesseth, that they vsed these skins to write on in his time. And Iosephus saith, that the holy Scriptures were first written in them. M. Varro thinks they were first found out at Pergamus a Citie of Asia, (from whence they yet take their name) at such time as the two kings, Ptolomeus, and Eumenes erected their Libraries; enuying one the other. Diodorus the Sicilian writeth, that the letters of the Ethiopians were made after the likenesse of sundrie beasts; and the extremities of diuers members of man; and of diuers instruments and tooles of artificers, and their intentions, &amp; words were not expressed by composition of sillables or letters; but by formes, and figures of Images; whose signification remained vnto them by vse in the memorie of men: for they would set downe a Kyte, a Crocodile, a mans eye, a hand, a face, and other such like things: The Kyte sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified a thing soone done, because he is one of the swiftest birds; and this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter is properly applied to home affaires which are speedily dispatched; the Crocodile did note some euil thing; the eye, an obseruer of Iustice, and a gard or watchman of the bodie; the right hand with the fingers stretched out, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokened libertie, or liberalitie; and the left hand closed, was hardnes and gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines. After this maner the figures of other parts of the bodie, &amp; formes of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain instruments, did notifie some other thing amongst those Ethiopians, who retayning it thorough long practize in their memorie, did readily vnderstand what the said figures ment, and signified.</p>
            <p>Those of Malabar, and other Indians dwelling between the riuer of Inde, and Ganges, do yet at this day write in palm-leaues, either greater or lesser, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the matter which they intend to write: In whole ones they write such things as they would haue to endure long; as the affaires of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and their Histories; the other things of lesse consequence, in a quarter, or half quarter, aswell on thone side, as thother. And when they haue written a great number, meaning to ioin them in books, they fasten them betwene two bordes, in steed of those forels or couers which we vse; after, as we sow our leaues, so do they tie theirs with strings to the said couers. For their missiue let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, it suffiseth that the leaf be writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and rolled vp in it self, &amp; in steed of sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it, they bind it with a thred of the palm it self: They vse to writ with an instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of yron or wood sharpned, passing lightly ouer the leaf not percing

               </gap>a Milanois historian, writing of the difcouerie of the new found lands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> made by the Castilians; saith that the inhabitants of Collacuan, brought into Spaine amongst other gifts, certaine bookes written in the fine inner ryndes of trees, which are found betweene the wood, and the thicke vttermost barke: And that they are taken sometimes of willowes, or of Alders, which they couered with course cloth, and fastned together with cyment, and rubbed ouer with fine plaister; which when it is drie, they write what they will on them. There bookes are not made by leaues, but they stretch them forth many cubits in length, and bring them into square peeces, ioined in such sort with cyment, or soder, that they are easie to turne, and seeme to be made of bordes, or tables of wood: and wheresoeuer they are opened, there appeare twosides written, in maner of two pages: as much there is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath, if they be not stretched out in length, because that vnder one leafe are many leaues written. The letters and characters are like vnto hookes, ginnes, files, starres, and other such formes; where with they write in lines af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our fashion, representing in some sort the auncient maner of the Egipti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and Ethiopians; and they paint between the lines figures of liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: namely of men as is aforesaid, as of Kings and princes, reciting their acts. They write also their Lawes, sacrifices, ceremonies, obseruations of the starres, and of husbandrie: Both the vpper, and vnder side is of fine work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship, and such as when they are foulded vp, they seeme nothing diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from ours. They make little table-bookes also of bordes of figtree, to write common things on; which they can easilie deface againe. The said Martyr saith also, that there haue bin found in Darienna, bookes made of the leaues of trees sowed together; and that at Mesira they vse figures, by which they signifie their affaires, aswell as by writing. Moreouer, that in Hispaniola, there is found a tree called Coppeia, whose leafe is as fit to write on as paper, with a needle, or pin, or a pointed sticke: and that it is to be thought, that this is the tree, in the leaues of which the Chaldees, the first inuentors of Letters, did write their conceits, before the vse of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters was inuented. The leafe will abide writing on both sides, aswell as our paper; it is about twelue fingers broad; and almost round; thicker then double parchmine; and verie tough: When it is wet, the letters appeare white in the greene leafe; but when it is dried, it becoms white, and hard as a woodden borde; but then the letters are yellow: it is neuer marred, nor defaced for wetting; if it be not burnt. Paulus Venetus writeth, that in the prouince of Arcadan (which is subject to the great Cham) there are neither letters, nor characters: but that men there make their contracts, and obligations, by little bordes or tablets; which they diuide in the midst; and compare afterwardes together, and confer their markes and signes one with the other, and so doe acknowledge the cause of such contracts.
<pb facs="tcp:13829:26"/>
The simple people of the new found land, not knowing the vse of Letters, did maruaile much to see that Christians by meanes of them, vnderstood one an other; and thought that the written leaues did speake by their commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and reported their secrets: in such sort, that they touched, and caried them with feare; as if there had bin some spirite in them; and that they had spoken by some diuinitie, and not by industrie of man.</p>
            <p>THE most co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon kind of writing, which we vse at this day in these parts, is with black Inke: which heretofore was made of the sweat of bathes, and furnaces; but now of gaules, gum Arabick, and ryndes of pomgranats; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all steeped in water of victriol or copperis beaten into pouder. There is vsed also red ynke, made either of Vermilion, or of the shauings or fylings of Brasell steeped in strong Lye, being yet warme, and putting a little Alum to it: and Azure made of some blew stone or earth; yelow, of goldsand or pouder. Also one may write with the iuyce of Mulberies, Cheries, and other such fruicts: And that with pennes made of reedes or canes, such as Erasmus vsed; or of brasse, gold, or siluer: or of goose-feathers, swans, peacockes, or ostriches: Without speaking of the subtilities of writing with Cyphers which Princes vse; and notes which Cicero inuented; or with Alum where the letters do not appeare; nor can not be read, except they be dipt in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; or with salt Armoniack, iuyce of an orenge, limon, citron, or onyon; to be discouered onelie when they are held neere the fire; or with grease, cinders, and coales. But the maner to write by imprinting hath excelled all the rest in readynes, and diligence, dispatching more worke in a day, then many speedie or swift writers are able to doe in a yeare. And since it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in so fitlie to our purpose, we will intermeddle here a little; and say briefly, as much as we shall think fit for this present discourse, of that which we haue heard, and learned of the most expert, touching this so rare, so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, and admirable Art: to the end, that if by warres, or other humaine mischiefes, and casualties, the vse thereof should at any time be left off, yet it should not bee altogether lost, but be faithfully kept and preserued by bookes, as it hath saued and preserued manie bookes.</p>
            <p>TO MAKE Characters for imprinting, it is requisite first to haue pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chions of steel, softned by the fire, on the which they graue with cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter-pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chions hardned, or grauing yrons steeled, the white which is within the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: perfecting and smoothing the bodies of them with fyles, where they are eminent, or vneuen; not at the right ends, but at the contrarie: after they wet these ponchions in water to harden them, and then polish them, and do strike them into little peeces of fine copper, that haue bin in the fire: which being so engrauen, do naturally represent the forme of the letters: which the artisans do call, striking of the matrices: Then do they iustify their matrices on moulds of yron, and in the white therof make their castings, with lead, tinglasse, anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and other mixed maters; to the end to harden them: and that they may endure the longer. The Letters being thus cast &amp; made, are put in a great case or box of wood, ful of little boxes, in to which they are distributed, according
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:13829:26"/>
to their seuerall sorts. From whence the Compositors (hauing layd before them the writing which they are to imprint) do take the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one by one, &amp; dispose them by pages and formes, which they put again into other chasies or frames of yron, with one or two crosses, locked or shut fast with furnitures of wood. Then the gouernour of the Presse taketh these last chasies or fourmes, and laieth them on the marble of his Presse, then beateth them with balles of wood filled with woll, couered with white leather, and soaked or rubbed with ynke well mixed and distributed, placing the leafe that is to be printed, on a double tympan or parchmin (hauing a wollen cloth betwixt them) and a moyst linnen cloth to keepe the leafe from mackling, and putting downe the frisquet of parchmin, which couereth the white or margent of the leafe, he maketh the traine of the presse to roule<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (which resteth on the cariage) till it come vnder the vice or spindle, vnto which the plattin is fastned; and taking the barre in his hand, he pulleth as hard as he can vntill the leafe be imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on one side, on which they bestow halfe the day; and the other halfe, on the other side; yelding in a day twelue hundred and fiftie sheetes, or thirteen hundred imprinted. But before they do this, they make two or three proofes, which are reulewed: and on this correction continew the rest. Two men are requisite about the presse, one to take, to gather, and order the sheetes, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> leaues; thother to beate on the fourme which is on the presse, and to distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute or bray the ynke on the stone or blocke: which could not serue the turne by reason of the great trauaile required therein, if they did not drawe the presse one after the other, and by turnes. Two presses also are needfull; thone for the ordinary worke; and thother to make the proofes, and reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: More or lesse Compositours (that is to say Collectors of letters togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) according as they are great, or small, or in a meane betweene both; and sometimes a Founder or melter is requisite to renew the letters. The ynke is made of the smoke or sweat of oyle, and dissolued in oyle which must be beaten, and distributed, because of the thicknes; and it would not sticke on the paper if it were not wett. Others haue thought it better to make let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of copper, saying that they are of lesse cost, and yet will endure lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. But experience hath founde that they are not so commodious, and that they pierce the paper. This is that which wee haue vnderstoode of this Art vnknowen heretofore amongst the auncient Greekes and Romains; wherof the Almains attribute the inuention to themselues. Notwithstanding the Portugals traficking on the farthest parts of the East, and the North, into China, and Cathay, haue brought therehence books printed in the languag, and writing of that Countrey, saying that they haue vsed it there a long time: which hath moued some to thinke, that the inuention hath bin brought out of that countrey through Tartaria and Moscouia, into Germany, and so after communicated to the rest of Christiandome: and yet not receiued of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometistes; who superstitiously account it a great sinne to write their Alcoran by any other meane but by the hand of man.</p>
            <p>Almost all nations haue remained a long time without letters, which hath
<pb facs="tcp:13829:27"/>
bin a cause of making the antiquities and originals vncertain. Touching those bookes which we haue, there are none of them written aboue 3000. yeres a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone, except the Hebrew, neither is there found amongst the Gentils any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour more auncient then Homer. Therefore the Egiptian Priest in Platoes Timeus, reprocheth vnto Solon, that the Greekes were all yong of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, hauing no olde opinion deriued from antiquitie, nor any aged sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. And Herodotus in his Terpsichore writeth, that the Phenicians arriuing with Cadmus at Berce, brought in the letters with them, which the Greekes had not before: and as Liuy writeth, they came but lately into Italy: The Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man toong was not written in auncient time; and the Hongarian began not long since to be written. The Nomedes of the great Tartaria, and some Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uages of the new-found Lands do vse no letters at all: But they haue amongst them, some matters touching their antiquities not written nor represented by notes which they giue by worde of mouth successiuely the one to tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. As the Iewes kept a long time the memory of the antiquities, which Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses afterward set downe in writing, continued by the successors of Adam, and of Noe, euen to his time. And the verses of Homer, before they were gathered in the forme which we see by Aristarchus, were learned and song onely by hart. And so vsed at the first the Egiptians, Chaldees, Babylonians, Greekes, Latins, and other nations.</p>
            <p>WE haue said enough of the imposition of names, the inuention, diuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and antiquitie of Letters; the maners of writing, and matters which are written on, and with what instruments, and of the Arte of Imprinting: now comming againe to our speach of tongues: I say that they get reputation by their property, elegancy, and sweetenes: by the sciences which are written in them; by power and greatnes of Empire; and by the religions, by which meanes they are inlarged in many Countries, and endure long; as also they are soone lost and decaied by their contraries.</p>
            <p>THE GREEKE tongue came in estimation by the elegancie, sweete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and richnes thereof, by Philosophy which hath bin handled therein; and al Arts and Sciences. It hath bin propagated by the nauigations, and Colonies of the Athenians, and by the armes of the Macedonians, which ruling far in Asia, and namely in Syria, and Egipt, made their language to be vnderstood in many Countries: In so much as by the saying of Cicero, it was in his time red almost in all nations. Also the new Testament first written in Greeke hath made it knowen in many places.</p>
            <p>THE ROMAINS no lesse ambitious in amplifying their tongue then their Empire, constrained the people which they had ouercome to speak Latin; and did not negociate with straungers in any tongue but their owne; to thend to spread it ouer all, with more veneration: as Valerius saith in his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond booke of auncient Institutions. They made their Prouincials to change not onely their language, but also their maners, and customes; to make them more tractable. Afterward the Christian religion passing into the West, and vsing Latin in the Churches, and Schooles; and consequently in publicke
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:13829:27"/>
instruments, and sentences of soueraigne Iudges; hath preserued it thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Italy, France, Spaine, England, Scotland, Germany, Poland, Prussia, Sweden, Hungarie, Bohemia, and part of Slauonia. The Christians in the East, and South Countries, as the Nestorians, Iacobites and Maronites vse the Syrian tongue, as we do the Latin: The Abyssins or Ethiopians vse the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daick, in the which they haue al the holy Scripture; not giuing credite to any other language whatsoeuer. The Iewes, wheresoeuer they are thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world, would neuer consent, that the old Testament which they vse should be translated, but do read, and singe it in Hebrew; practizing in their contracts the tongues of those Countreys where they dwell. Likewise the Mahometists haue not suffred their Alcoran, to be red, or vnderstood in any tongue but the Arabian; in which it was written: which resembling the Hebrew, Chaldaicke, and Syriack is at this day largely spred abroad. For although the Tartarians, Corasmians, Persians, and Turkes, haue a diuers language from the Arabian; the Syrians, modern Arabians, and Mores, a tongue somwhat like it; yet so is it that the Arabian-grammer tongue in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and sciences, amongst the learned, the Iudges, and Priests is common to all the inhabitants almost of Asia, Africke, and the third part of Europe. Amongst all the languages of Europe there is not any more ample, and large then the Slauonian; vnderstood, and spoken by the Seruians, Mysians, Bos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, Dalmatians, Croatians, Slauons, Carnians, Bohemians, Morauians, Sle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites, Polaques, Mazouites, Pomerans, Cassubites, Sarbians, Ruthenians, and Moscouites. Moreouer the Lythuanians, Nugardians, Plescouians, Smol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, and Ohalicians begin to speake Slauonian. It was also familiar amongst the Mammelucs, as it is at this present in the Turkishe Court. In Asia, the Tartarian is vnderstoode thoroughout the Northe, and a part of the East: The Moorish thoroughout Africke; and the Brasilian in the newe found Lands.</p>
            <p>YET haue not tongues any better estate then other humane things; but euen as buildinges, habites, maners, customes, lawes, Magistrates, maners of liuing both publicke and priuate, armes, engins, and instruments are changed: so are wordes and languages; which perishe at length not leauing by succession of time any apparance of their manner of writing. We haue now no knowledge at all of the Oscian, and Hetrurian tongue. The Prouen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal in times past so much celebrated amongst famous writers, is not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of the Prouencals at this day. The auncient Gaulish, Spanish, Persian, and Punick languages are lost.</p>
            <p>THE HEBREW hath lost much of his integritie by the calamitous exiles, and often mutations hapned to the Iewes vnder diuers Lords: For the Assyrians, Egyptians, Greekes, and Romains raigning ouer the Iewes, assaied for the hatred they bare to their religion, to distroy the Hebrew tongue, and the books of the Law; which they caused all to be burned, as many as they could get into their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds; &amp; namely the Assyrians. But they were miraculous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly restored againe by Esdras, or Iesus his sonne the high priest, which knew
<pb facs="tcp:13829:28"/>
then by hart; and changed the Hebrew letters to hinder the Iewes from being mingled with the Samaritans; which came of the Gentils in Iury as Eusebius reporteth. These letters which the Iewes haue sithence vsed, differ onely by figures, and points from those of the Samaritans; which are those that were giuen asore time by Moyses.</p>
            <p>But being so many times dispersed hither and thither, into diuers Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and mingled with strangers, whose Captiues, and tributaries they were: (as they are yet at this present in what part soeuer they dwell) they haue kept few words pure; amongst which are found some ambiguous, signifying con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary things, not to be vnderstood but by continuance of the speach; or by the addition, detraction, or inuersion of the points, holding the place of vowels. Their phrases are obscure, and full of metaphors, parables, and riddles to bee construed diuersly: Neuertheles it is profitable for Christians, and especially for Diuines to know this tongue, as well for the better vnderstanding of the scriptures; as to refute more certainly the Iewes, if they happen to dispute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them: As also the Arabian is necessary for the conuersion of Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metistes; by reason whereof it was ordeined at the Counsell of Vienna, that these two tongues should be publickly taught in the chiese Vniuersities of Christendome.</p>
            <p>THE SARAZENS spreading abroad by armes with their religion, &amp; lordship the Arabian tongue, first they destroied the Persian, with the letters, and learning thereof; and by the commandement of their Caliphes, they cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the bookes written therein to be burnt; imagining that while the Persians contending before with the Greekes in armes, and learning, should haue these bookes contayning naturall sciences, lawes of the Countrey, and aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cerimonies, they could not be good Mahometists: as before the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians had indeuoured, to abolish the bookes of the Gentils, and vtterly to deface the memorie of their diuinitie. After these Sarazens going into Egipt, they banished out of Alexandria the Greek with the disciplines written therein, and out of Africk the Latin; as the Romaines before had banished the African tongue, with the learning and letters thereof. So that nations passing out of one Countrey into another, do change the maners, tongues, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, and dominions, the victors spoyling whatsoeuer they thinke good in the land of the vanquished, defacing their titles, and destroying for enuy that which they cannot cary away: to thend to abolish the honour and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of others; and that none but their owne may be celebrated and spoken off. So do the Turkes at this day to the Christians they rule ouer: and so did in auncient time, the Goths, Alans, Hunnes, Vandales, Seruiens, Turules, and Lombards; who diuers times conquering Countries whose languages they disdained, neither vnderstanding them, nor knowing how to read them, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted them, in making new by mixtion of their own with those which they found: insomuch as the poore people remayning after such transmigrations, did learne the languages of the cruel, and inhumane vsurpers, to vse in speach vnto them, that they might be thought the fitter subiectes. Moreouer these
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:13829:28"/>
barbarous people referring all vnto warre, and contemning all other disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines; burnt the libraries and all the bookes in them, vnto which the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned had recommended all their memorials: in so much that with the losse of the tongues, there ensued also the losse of the sciences which were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in them; from whence there arose great ignorance in the world which la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted a long time. In this maner of the Grammaticall Greeke, proceeded the vulgar; Of the Latin, the Italian, French and Spanish; in which are found many Arabian words, by reason that the Sarazens held Spaine a long time: Of the grammaticall Arabian, the Vulgar, and Moorish, vsed from Syria, vnto the straights of Marocco; and comming as neere vnto it, as the Italian doth to the Latin: Of the Almaygne, and French, the English: The Moore which commeth of the Arabian, and the Turke of the Tartarian, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing on an other as the Italian, and Spanyarde. And so of those which are nowe in vse are others made, and of them others will bee made in time to come.</p>
            <p>But howbeit they change vncessantly, and that in the same Countrey and language, there appeareth in short time a difference both in speaking, and pronouncing: yet euery where there are somethat speake finer, and purer then the rest: such as were the Athenians in Greece, the Romains in Italy, and the Tuscans there at this day; The Castilians in Spaine; the Saxons in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many; The Persians in Asia; The Nobles, and Courtiers in France; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the question is decided which hath bin debated betweene some learned men: namely whether the auncient Greekes, and Romaines had two lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, and whether Plato, Aristotle, and Demosthenes in Greeke; and Cicero, Salust, and Cesar in Latin, did write in their mother-tongues. It is certaine, that in Athens there was but one language, and in Rome one other, yet the speach of the common people was not so pure, as that of men of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and the ciuiler sort; as one may see by the Latin of Vitruuius, who was a chiefe Mason, and Cicero who was Consull: Which elegancie, and purity of speech is preserued longer amongst women, which conuerse not so much with strangers as the men; and commonly are more curious to speake well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tully in the third booke of his Oratour, writeth that in his time, the learning of the Athenians was lost in Athens; only remaining in that towne the school or house of studies; which was not cared for of the Citizens; and the stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers enioyed it, which were drawen thither in some sort by the name and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the citie: notwithstanding that an vnlearned Athenian excelled the most learned of Asia, not in words but in sound of the voice; and not so much in speaking wel, as in pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cing sweetly. Likewise saith he there is a certain voice or accent peculiar, and proper to the Romain kind, &amp; to the City, in the which there is nothing offending, or displeasing the eare, or sauouring in any sort of peregrinity, &amp; strangnes; in so much that the Romains with lesse study then the Latins, did excell the most learned amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by sweetnes of voice.</p>
            <p>THE GREEKES dwelling in true Greece, in Italy, Asia, in Sicile, and other Islandes, had fower tongues or speeches; The Atticke,
<pb facs="tcp:13829:29"/>
Dorike, Eolike, and Ionian: and in choosing out of euery of them through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Poets words, and figures, as came fittest to their purpose, they made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother tongue which they called the Common: and after vnder one name onely, called them all fiue the Greeketongue. And although the Athenian, were finer and more fruitfull then the rest; yet the learned which were not Athenians by nation, did write only after their natural maner, fearing perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture that they should not attaine to the Attike purity, vnto which but sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and by leasure attained those which were borne elswhere. For Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrastus who had long abode in Athens, being reputed most eloquent, was knowen by an old woman of Athens to be a straunger by his speach; Pollio obiected Paduanisme vnto Liuie; and vnto Virgill who was a Mantuan, it was reproached that he spake not Romain: so euery tongue by how much the farther it is from his natural spring, is the lesse pure. As in old time the Syrians and Egyptians, speaking Greeke did not speake it so purely as the Athenians; nor the Gaules, Spaniards, or Africans, Latin as the Romains: for although their words were Greeke or Latin, yet they retained the phrase of their owne Countrey. Insomuch that speaking Greeke or Latin they were alwaies kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen for straungers: as it hapneth to the English &amp; Scots, Flemings, Almains, Italians, and Spaniards, when they speake French, if they haue not learned it very young.</p>
            <p>But the tongues as all other humaine things, haue their beginning, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse, perfection, corruption, and end: and being rude at first, do afterwards polish themselues, with ciuilitie of maners and knowledge; And when they haue endured a time in puritie, and elegancy, they are corrupted, and do fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally perish: and by proces of time no appearance of their writing remaineth. The Greekes at the first were but rude, and grosse, as Thucydides, Plato, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Aristotle affirme: and the first which became ciuill amongst them were the Athenians, who polished their language, which they also brought vnto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; where it remained not long: but was corrupted, and lost, togither with the libertie of the Countrey, being supplanted by the Macedonians, Romains, and other straungers which haue ruled there. In such sort that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer sithence could be restored, the true propriety, and natural elegancy of the Greeke which was spoken by Plato, Aristotle, Isocrates, Demosthenes, and Eschines: but in steed of that tongue (which may be said to haue bin the best in the world) there is at length come an other vsed at this present in Greece, and in the Isles adioyning, mingled of many other languages: which is euery day falling to decay vnder the Turkish Empire, wherewith the Countrey hath bin already more then a hundred yeres most miserably oppressed.</p>
            <p>If the first Romain writings had endured till this present, we should see that Euander, and Turnus, and the other Latins of that time, spake otherwise then did afterwards the last Romaine Kings, and the first Consuls. The ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses which were song by the Salian priests were scarcely vnderstood; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were so ordained by the first founders, they were not chaunged for reuerence of the religion. Polybius writeth that the language was so much
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:13829:29"/>
changed from the first Punick warr to the second, that with great difficulty were vnderstood the treaties made before betweene the Romains and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians: And it remained rude about fiue hundred yeres, hauing no writer in it worthy of memory. From that time forward the people gaue themselues to learning, and some became learned: yet hard in their speech; commended onely, for hauing bin the inuentours; and first teachers of the Latin tongue: which was after made most pure, and perfect, by Cicero, Caesar, and other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquent men, which florished then in great number: in whom indeed the purity there of is to be acknowledged. For afterward the common wealth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing changed into a monarchy, and the maners corrupted; the speach was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so changed and corrupted, losing his natural grace, &amp; goodnes vnder the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours. Then the Empire being translated from Rome to Constantinople, many strange nations comming into Italy, altered the tongue, so that men left speaking it, &amp; it remained in books only: which were not red, nor vnderstood by the space of eight hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred yeres; some of them lost, others eaten by worms, and deuoured by age: til such time as some Greekes and Italians, did by study make these two auncient tongues to reuiue when they were almost dead: by copying out, publishing, and correcting the bookes that remained in some libraries, such as had bin preserued from the rage of those barbarous nations; which hath so happely succeeded, that the said tongues haue recouered great light, with the arts written in them; which we see restored with them; and many inuentions added to antiquitie as shalbe declared hereafter.</p>
            <p>Then the Romain Empire declining to the West, as the Ostrogoths, and Lombards, had possessed Italy; the Visigoths, and Sarazens the Countrey of Prouence, Languedoc, Aquitayne, and Spayne. The Burguignons, and Frenchmen, the Gaules, Belgick, and Celtick: the Vandals, Bethick, &amp; Africk; by their conuersation the Latin was corrupted: Of which corruption, came the Italian, French, and Spanish. The Italian remained long time vnpolished, because there was none that tooke care thereof; or endeuoured to giue it any polishment, vntill Dante, Petrarch, and Boccace; who haue much embelished it by their conceipts ingeniously expressed, and elegantly couched in prose, and verse: Where in they haue bin seconded by others no lesse learned, and eloquent; who haue likewise enriched this language with many faire works, and translations. As much is there happened to the Spanish, &amp; French, which haue bin made within these fiftie yeres more elegant then they were before, by the diligence of some excellent men which haue translated a great number of bookes not onely Greeke, and Latin, but Italian also into them; showing that all sciences may conueniently be handled in them.</p>
            <p>CERTAINLY it is a great Comfort, and ease found out in this variety of languages, which cannot be vnderstood, nor learned of all, to translate out of one into another. By this meanes the old Testament hath bin translated out of Hebrew into Greek, and into Latin; the new Testament out of Greek into Latin; and consequently both Testaments into Syriack, Chaldaick, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian, Persian, Indian, Armenian, Scythian, Sclauonian, German, English,
<pb facs="tcp:13829:30"/>
French, Italian, and into all languages vsed by men: without which benefit the greater part of them had remayned in perpetual ignorance of God. And that there is in the same some diuine working, it appeared then, when Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomeus Philadelphus desiring to put into his excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t library the holy books of the Pentateuch, and of the Prophets translated into Greeke, and hauing procured out of Iury 72. Interpreters skilful in both languages: to make proof of their fidelity, he caused them all to worke apart seuerally; and yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles found in them such consent and agreement, that there was not one differing from the other in the sence of the Scripture: hauing receiued this so meruailous a gift of God, to thend the scripture might be acknowledged to be diuine as it is; and that the translation might be of more authoritie, as being don, not by the diligence of men, seruing but for the words; but by the spirit of God, guyding and gouerning the vnderstanding of the Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. Moreouer by such meanes Phylosophy, Physicks and the Mathematick, were translated out of the Greeke into Arabian, and out of Greek, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabian into Latin: many arts, infinite histories communicated by one nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to another. Varro, and Columella, say that the Romains vnderstanding the profit which was contained in the bookes of husbandry made by Mago the Carthaginian in the Punicke tongue, ordained by decree of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat that they should be translated into Latin: whence may manifestly bee knowen the profit of translation, fauoured by God in the exposition of his word, and holy scripture; confirmed by the consent of all nations, in the communicating of arts: and approued by the aucthoritie of the sage Senate of the triumphant Seigniory of Rome. Yet can I not deny but that it is more painefull then praiseworthy; where diligence assisted with Iudgement is more requisite, then any excellent knowledge; which appeareth more in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenting of it selfe, then in translating; that is to say, writing out of one booke into another; obseruing the proprietie of both tongues without adding any thing of his owne, or taking ought from the authour: whom it is not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to translate so faithfully, &amp; elegantly, but there wilbe alwaies more grace in the originall then the translation; where the words are alwaies tyed to the phrase, sauouring more or less of the tongue out of which one transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, in diuers strange wordes belonging vnto the religion, state of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, lawes, magistrates, or sciences, which it is not lawfull to change; and hard or vncouth to make new in their places: and againe in the metaphors, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legories, comparisons, similitudes, and other figures, and ornaments of speach: ech seuerall tongue hauing I know not what proper, and peculiar, vnto it selfe, not to be expressed in an other. In such sort that there is no means to bring a tongue to perfection by translation; and there was neuer translator how sufficient soeuer, that deserued the like praise as his authour; whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Theodorus Gaza list to say, the most excellent that is knowen in this qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Cicero, Father of the Romain eloquence, translated into Latin Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon his Oeconomick; the contrary orations of Eschines and Demosthenes, the Timaeus of Plato, and the Astronomical poeme of Aratus. But S. Hierome
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:13829:30"/>
found great difference betweene his writings, and translations; in which he found wanting his wonted elegancie and facilitie. Wherefore it were better to put forth his owne inuentions for him that hath meanes to doe it. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding if one doe it to helpe the ignorant of the tongues; or for his owne particular study, to thend to fashion his stile, and to settle his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the best authours, as Cicero himselfe did, and I haue assaied to doe after his example and exhortation in accommodating the vertues of the most esteemed auncient writers to the manners, and affaires of this time; I recken translation very comendable. And he that with a mediocritie of vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and knowledge should be the first that had proposed to his nation, the lights or lampes of learning, namely Isocrates, Xenophon, Demosthenes, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle, Plato, and the Schoolemasters of mankind, as they are termed by Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca, which haue long time lyen hidden in Schooles, or buried in libraries, without being put in vre, were not altogether to be reiected; especially tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailing in a tongue not yet polished, nor accustomed vnto arts: which will be much amended by trauailing therein, euen as the Greeke and Latin came by little and little to their perfection, by handling of good maters in them, as Philosophy, matter of state, or publick gouernment, deeds of armes, and other honest &amp; profitable sciences; not by writing of fabulous Romances, or amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Sonets, or such kinde of stuffe wherewith the vulgar tongues are all pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered. But there is need of learned and eloquent men, such as hardly and rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are found in many hundreds and thousands of yeres worthy of admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: of whom we haue alwaies had no lesse want then other Countries: or if some such haue at any time bin found here, they haue for the most part bin delighted instrangetongues more then in their owne. But it is great reason that the learned should exactly know their own tongue, and that they should write in it sometimes to make it better; and do good to their owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen rather then to straungers: so that the Greeke, Latin, Hebrewe, Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daick, and Arabian which are common to many nations be not thereby for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten or layd aside: wherehence would arise great obscuritie to those dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplines, which are written in them, confusion to the world, and ignorance vnto men depriued of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication which they haue by means of them, not vnderstanding one another afterward, nor conferring togither. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing I would neuer counsail to employ so many yeres on these learned tongues as men haue accustomed to do, and to consume the time inlerning of words, which ought rather to be bestowed in knowledge of such things, as they haue not afterward the meanes nor leasure to intend: which error brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth great backwardnes and damage to the sciences.</p>

After he had so furnished them, to thend they should not distroy one another, he gaue them meanes to defend them thone from the other; and to remaine abroad without couert. Clothing some of them with thicke heare, little houses, or shells and skales of diuers sorts, with feathers, or hard skinnes, against the vntemperatenes of Winter, &amp; Sommer: and of the same things made them beds, and natural couches: ioining to their feet, clawes, nailes, and callosites: to their heads, hornes, teeth, and tronks: then distributed to them food, making some to eate grasse on the earth; others to feed on fruits, &amp; roots of trees; &amp; others more greedy to deuoure one another.

Prouided that they which liued on pray should be in some sort barren, and the others that were subiect to be deuoured, more fruitful: to thend that the kind should continue. For the diuine prouidence hath bin wise therin, making al fearful beasts, and such as are good to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Therefore the hare is very fruitfull, and alone of al kind of venison, surchargeth the burden in his belly, because that men, beasts, and birds, do prosecute him to death. Likewise the Cony is sound so ful of rabets that some of them are yet without heare, others somewhat riper, and others going out of the belly. But the Lyonesse which is the strongest, and hardiest of all beastes, neuer bringeth but one; and but once in her life. But Epime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus being not very wise, he gaue all to the brute beastes, reseruing nothing for man, whom he left alone without force, without power, without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie, starke naked, without armour, without clothing, vnhosed, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood, without conuenient food, and wanting all things: In such sort that he could not resist other creatures being then more excellent then himselfe. For the staggs ran swifter; the beares, and Lions were stronger; the Peacock was fairer; the fox was craftier; the Emmet more diligent; and the snayle better lodged then he: Euery beast found a medicine fit for his malady and hurt; whereof man was ignorant. Of this came such a confusion that men perished by little and little thorough diuers sorts of cruelt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e: In such sort that their kind had soone bin consumed, without the aduise of prudent Prometheus; who seeing so great a fault, to redresse it, stole from Vulcan, and Minerua the artificial wisedom, togither with the fire: being not possible to obtaine it, or to vse it without fire; and so did distribute it to mankinde: by meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of men began for their common commoditie to assemble togither for feare of the be astes, and to thend to resist them, helping one another, and seeking here and there after safe places for their habitation, they learned to make houses, and garments to auoid the sharpnes of cold, and the force of heate; to reserue fruits for their necessitie; to prepare armes for their defence; and to finde out other commodities for their life. Which finally necessity it selfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inuentour of all things maketh knowen particularly to the vnderstanding of men; vnto whom were giuen for helpes, their hands, speach and reason; Reason to inuent, speach to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the hands to accomplish that which they should either inuent themselues by reason, or learne of others by speach: for no other creature doth speak in deed, for as much as speach proceedeth of reason; nor hath hands; though peraduenture somewhat like vnto handes. Wherefore man hath first found out by reason the most necessary thinges; as food, clothing; and armes: and afterward such as serue for pleasure, ornament and magnificence: he hath imposed names on euery thing, inuented letters of diuers sorts, and sundry kinds of writing; made all arts both mechanical and liberall: proceeding so farr as to measure the earth, and the sea; to reduce by instruments the mighty masse of heauen, scarse to be comprehended by vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and to propose it before our eyes. Moreouer the same Plato affirmeth
<pb facs="tcp:13829:32"/>
that before men liued in company, and spake togither, or that they had begun to inuent; and exercise arts; for as much as they alone of al other creatures did participate of the diuine nature, being indewed with an immortall soule; that they by reason of this diuine affinitie, did thinke first that there were Gods, and so honoured them; and prayed to them: from thence, had religion her begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, publicke gouernment, iudgement, negotiation and traficke by Sea, and by land, lawes were established, magistrates created, innumerable trades in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented, houses, villages, and townes builded, consequently cities, castles, and fortresses; and then kingdoms, and Empires erected: Wherehence hath suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, the greatnes, and excellency of mankind such as we see it at this day. From thence I say began religion which is more natural to men then all their other arts, and inuentions: no nation in the world hauing bin found so rude, so cruel, &amp; barbarous; but that it had some appearance of religion. For how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that the greater part is ignorant, what God, &amp; how they ought to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship him; yet al notwithstanding do agree that we ought to honour, pray, and feare one God the authour of all things: which is confirmed not only in the first, and most auncient nations, as the Ethiopians, Indians, Armenians, Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees, Hebrewes, Assyrians, Egyptians, Greekes, Romains, and Gaules: but also in the Goths, Vandales, Sarazens, Tartarians, Turkes, Persians, Cathay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans or Chinoys: And not onely in our hemisphere; but also amongst the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipodes; and Sauages of the new found lands: of whom heretofore we neuer had any knowledge. They which haue nauigated thither, haue found many people liuing yet as the first men, without letters, without Lawes, without Kings, without common wealthes, without arts; but yet not without reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: who beleeue, that the soules of the dead go into other places according to such workes as they haue done in this life. To intertaine it, haue bin ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed cerimonies, praiers ordained, temples edifyed, oratories, chapels, hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals, almeshouses, cloisters, and couents: Sacrificers or priests haue bin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted, and much respected in all Countries. And if it pleased God that hee woulde be worshipped thoroughout all the world in one selfe same maner, men shoulde be deliuered of great hatred, and cruel discorde, happening a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them thorough the diuersitie of Religions.</p>
            <p>AT THE beginning men were very simple and rude in all thinges, little differing from beastes. They did eate in the fieldes and mountaines, the rawe fleshe of beastes, or herbes, with their rootes, stalkes, and leaues, which the earth brought foorth of his owne accorde; and in the woodes the fruictes of wilde trees; or venison: on the bankes of the Sea, Riuers, Lakes, Pooles, and Marishes, they fedd on fishes and birdes: They clad them selues with skinnes, in steede of garments; to bee defended from heat and colde, from winde, raine, and snow, they withdrewe themselues into great holow trees; or vnder their thick leaued branches; or into low dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, hideous caues, holow vautes, cabins, and lodges made of great logges of wood, and lightly couered with boughes, stalkes, canes, and reeds. Then hauing strong bodies, they nourished themselues with strong meates, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:13829:32"/>
also liued longer. They abode euer almost in the open aire, in continuall tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, and lying on the hard ground, wheresoeuer sleep ouertooke them. When they waxed weaker; and could not digest such meates, nor dwell in the open aire naked, and vncouered, they were constrayned to seeke by little and little, to soften this wild and sauage maner of lyuing, which they could no longer endure: learning to sow Corne, which before grew vp vnknowen amongst herbes and weeds; and to dresse the vines, which likewise the earth brought forth amongst other plants; to transplant, and to graffe fruict-trees, to thend to make the fruicts better; and to dresse and season both flesh and fish: and then to build, and to assemble themselues in companies, that they might liue the more safely, and commodiously. In such maner were they reduced, from that brutish life which they led, to this sweetnes, and ciuili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; beginning from that time forward, to feed, cloath, and lodge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in better sort, and more commodiously.</p>
            <p>Now whereas men haue taken nourishment, first of tame beastes, before either of graine, or of fruits: there is no doubt but that pasturage, grasing, &amp; shepheardrie, were before husbandrie and tillage; as it appeareth by the most auncient nations, who hauing so liued from the beginning, haue taken their names there hence, as the Hebrewes, and the Italians, which is to say shepheards, and that many Nations vse it euen at this day, exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing (as may be said) a kind of liuelie tillage. The tilling and planting of the earth haue bin both inuented after pasturage, and vnto both haue bin added hunting, fouling, and fishing. On the one side they haue found out the vse of Wheat, which in these partes is found the best and most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious nourishment: as also Barley, Millet, Rye, and all other knowen kind of graine. On the other side, they haue found Ryce, Mahiz, and Iuca: the maner to sow, and gather them, to thresh, fan, and winnow, to boult and sift flower, to knead it, and to make dowe, to mould it, and raise past, to make loaues, and to bake them in the ouen: whereunto are appointed and doe serue, the Millers and Bakers. Then haue they added pease and beanes, and other sortes of pulse, both new and old: Herbes of diuerse sorts, and rootes; as persley, lettice, spinage, tyme, pepperwort, marioram, buglosse, maloes, beetes, endiue, succorie, purslain, sage, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worts, melons, cucombers, gourds, artichocks, sperage, mugwort, onyons, garlick, leekes, chibols, carrets, parsnebbs, nauets, radishes, and turnepps, mingling with them salt, oiles, butter, and suet, to giue them a better tast, and make them the more sauorie. Moreouer the fruits of trees, cheries, plums, peares, apples, peaches, apricocks, mulberies, medlers, quinces, raisins, figgs, oliues, citrons, orenges, dates, chestnuts, and marrons. And not content with graine, fruits, herbes, and rootes, they haue bin giuen to eat the flesh, first of themselues, which they haue left for the most part with horrour; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of other creatures both tame and wild; of the land, of the water, and flying in the aire; neither leauing inward nor outward part of them, which they haue not fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d mean to season, boile, &amp; seeth, roast &amp; frie, or put in past &amp; bake with saulces,
<pb facs="tcp:13829:33"/>
and spices, brought from the fardest parts of the earth, making puddings, saul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciges, haggasses, tripes, and chitterlings, which they serue at the beginning of meales with potages, broathes, and sallets; and at the end therof cheeses, tarts, and creames; wafers, iunkets, and march-panes, prepared and dressed by Cookes and pybakers: Neither hath their pompe and riot bin any lesse with fishes, both of the sea, and of freshwater. In somuch, that Plutarch in his Symposiacke proposing this question, whether that the Sea or the Earth brought forth most delicate and delicious meates, findeth businesse, and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie enough in the decision therof. Moreouer being not pleased with milk, nor faire water to drink; they found out a way to brew Beere, and Ale; to draw and presse out Syder of apples and peares; wyne out of grapes, and palmes; and to make sweet drinkes, compounded with honie, as bragget, meath, and metheglem, which they call Medons in Moscouia, and Polonia; and infinite other artificial drinks, which they haue dronk in cuppes of gold, siluer, cristall, and glasse, spicing them in diuers maners. Besides, to make their drink fresher, they haue found meanes in some places to keepe snow, and y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e, all the yeare. At the first sitting on the ground they tooke their repast on the grasse, &amp; vnder the shadow of leaues: after they made stooles, formes, benches, tables, and tressels: Table clothes, table napkins, trenchers; salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellers, cupbords, vessel, and vtensiles of diuers sorts, and fashions; appointing officers fit for these charges: as Stewards of the house, pantlers; cellerers, caruers, cupbearers, cookes, boylers, and rosters. Salust blameth the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, which sought in his time by sea and by land, after all sorts of delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, not expecting hunger, nor thirst, nor cold, nor wearinesse; but preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all these things by disordinate appetite. Liuie telleth how after the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of Asia, all sorts of superfluities and delicacies came vnto Rome, and that then the Romains began to make banquets with more curiositie, and cost: And a Cooke, which before was held amongst them for a seruile drudge, began to come in reputation. Seneca complaineth, that the kitchins were more celebrated, then the Schooles of Philosophers, &amp; Rhetoricians. Who would not wonder to heare tell of the excessiue feasts of Anthonius and Cleopatra? or of the Emperour Caligula, who consumed on one supper the reuenues of three prouinces? of Heliogabalus; of Lucullus; or of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digalitie of Esope, and Apicius, who shortned his life, fearing least goods would faile him to the maintayning of his sumptuousnes? In one feast made to Vitellius by his brother, were serued two thousand dainty fishes, and seuen thousand birds. Good God, how much paine hath bin procured vnto men by their insatiable gluttonie and gurmandise! how manie sorts of workmen, and their seruants hath it set on work! But their curiositie in apparell hath not bin lesse; to the furnishing whereof many occupations haue bin applied: as the spinner, carder, tucker, weauer, clothworker, fuller, sherman, dyer, taylor, cutter, hosier, doubletmaker, linnen draper, semster, capper, and felt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, feathermaker, lacemaker, embroderer, felmonger, skinner, furrier, leatherdresser, tanner, currier, cordwayner, and shoomaker. They haue spon

and wouen flaxe, hempe, woll, cotton, silke, made of wormes, and of it haue made Veluet, Satin, Damaske, Taffeta; and of goats haire, and camels haire, Grogram, and Chamlet: whereunto haue bin added fustians, bombasies, sarges, cloth of Gold, and Siluer, purple, and skarlet, with other infinite co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours: making of these stuffes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shirts, rochets, wimples, doublets, caps, hats, hoods, gowns, coats, cloaks, cassocks, ierkins, &amp; iackets, enriched with orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, trimmings, embroderies, and laces, after diuers fashions, whith change from Countrie to Countrie, and from day to day, thorough the lightnes of persons. Of tanned and coried leather they haue made Ierkins, buskins, bootes, shooes, and pantofles, and lyned and faced them with veluet. They haue applied Carcanets and Chaines to their necks, brasselets to their hands, rings to their fingers, spectacles to their eies, paynting to their cheekes, iewels to their eares, tyres and borders of gold to their heads, and garters to their leggs: distinguishing by the habits, the Princes from the subiects; the Magistrats from priuate men; the noble from the base; the learned from the ignorant; and the holie from the prophane. What shall I say of the skinns of Wolues, Sables, Martins, and other precious furres, fet from the farthest parts of the North, which they buy for excessiue prices. Plinietel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it for a wonderfull strange thing, and full of great superfluitie, that he had seen Lollia Paulina a Romain Ladie, widow of the Emperour Caligula, at a wedding banquet, hauing her head, necke, and bosome couered, and her handes likewise, with pearles, and Emeraudes, ioyned together, and enterlaced: which iewels were esteemed to bee worth a Million of crownes.</p>
            <p>The Queene Cleopatra comming to meete Antonius in Cilicia, put her selfe on the ryuer Cydnus, into a boate, whose sterne was all of gold, the sayles of Purple, the oares of Siluer, which kept stroke in rowing with the sound of Musicke: Touching her person, shee was laied vnder a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilion of gold tyssued, decked like the Goddesse Venus, and round about her were maruailous odoriferous and sweet smells, and perfumes. Helio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabalus slept on a tyke full of hares heares, and partridge-feathers. The bed of Darius the last King of the Persians, was sumptuouslie garnished, and couered with a vine of golde, in maner of a grate or lettice, enriched with raisins and grapes hanging in it, all of precious stones: And at his bedds head, there was in Treasure fiue thousand Talents of golde; at his bedds foote, three thousand Talents of Siluer: So much and so deerely he esteemed and valued his nights pleasure, that he would haue his head rest on so great cheuisance.</p>
            <p>But yet, the excesse in buylding hath bin more outragious, for comming out of hollow trees, houells, bowers, cabins, and lodges, couered with straw, and reedes, and going into houses buylded with brickes, stones, and marble, cut, squared, and fastened with morter, plaister, lyme, and varnish, hanged with Tapistrie and painted, couered with slattes and tyles, the roofe hollow with arches and vaults, and the flower curiouslie paued

and wrought, diuided by halles, vpper and lower chambers, vtter chambers, inner chambers, with-drawing-chambers, bedchambers, wardrobes, cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, closets, staires, entries, galleries, and terrasses: They haue accomodated arts and artificers for the buylding and furnishing of them: as Architects, masons, plaisterers, tylers, carpenters, smithes, glasiers, tapisters, painters, grauers, cutters, caruers, melters, casters of Images, goldsmithes, gilders, lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smithes, and others: buylding pallaices, castles, townes, cities, bridges, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duicts, pyramides, sepulchers, theaters, amphitheaters, bathes, and porches; turning the course of streames, and raising of mounts, and throwing downe mountains, with prodigalitie exceeding all boundes of reason; hoping thereby to make their names immortall. And whereas it was necessarie for them, intertayning that varietie and magnificence, to trafique by sea and by land, and to haue Cariers on them both; to thend to receiue from other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, such commodities as they wanted, or to send abroad such things as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded with them; to nauigate, they hollowed first the bodies of trees after the maner of the Indian Canoes, and afterwards made boates, schiffes, pina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and gallies, with three, fower, fiue, sixe, seauen, eight, and ten Oares on a side, yea; to thirtie on a side: foistes, brigantines, barkes, caruels, ships, hulks, gallions, galliasses, armadoes, and argosies, with their tackling, and furniture, of anchors, cabels, mastes, sayles, artillerie, ordinance, victuals, and compas, or boxe: To receiue, keepe, and repaire them, arsenals, portes, and hauens; To guide, and to man them were appointed Pilots, mariners, sailers, rowers, and gallyslaues: euen as carters, wagoners, coachmen, and horse-keepers were ordayned for trafick, and trauaile by land. And for both cariages, cursitours, regraters, porters, balencers; Masters of ports, customers, controllers, reuisitors, and serchers. To serue which turne with more ease, it was needfull to coine money of gold, siluer, brasse, and copper, defined in value by the quantitie and waight; marked with diuerse figures, according to the diuersitie of the Countrie where it is made: being not possible to vse per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation in euery thing: and therefore were brought in money-tellers, and changers. Moreouer it was necessarie to haue Notaries or Scriueners, to passe the contracts of Markets, sergeants, huissiers, solicitors, proctors, infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, auditors, iudges, counsailors, presidents, registers, criers, and executours of sentences. For the expedition of roiall letters, Secretaries, Maisters of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests, Chauncelors, or Keepers of seales. The Physicians, Chirurgians, and Apothecaries do serue for health, vsing druggs, comming for the most part out of strange Countries: as Rheubarbe, Cassia, Aloe, Agarike, and such others. Gymnasts, pedotribes, athletes, fencers, wrastlers, runners, swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, leapers, and tumblers, for the exercise of the bodie. For pleasure, and recreation, singers, minstrells, musicians, plaiers on instruments, organists, dauncers, and ballad-makers, rymers, iesters, iuglers, barbers, perfumers, drawers of flowers, and curious workes. Also not contented with stickes, and stones, which the simplicitie of nature furnished vnto their Choler, they haue inuented infinite sorts of armes, and weapons, both offenssiue and

defensiue; long-bowes, and crosse-bowes; with arrowes and quiuers, slings, darts, iauelins, lances, pikes, partysans, halbards, swords, bucklers, rapiers, and daggers, shieldes, targets, cuyras<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Going farther yet, they haue found out other estates, offices, and exercises, imploying some about conducting and managing the publick reuenewes: as Receiuours, Treasorers, Masters of accompts, Auditours, Controllers: Others about the counsaile of Princes, and of States: Others to the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing and preseruing of the Lawes, seeing to the publick gouernment, to discipline, and correction of maners.</p>
            <p>Then amongst so many commodities, idlenesse increasing with ease, and wealth, they applied themselues to the studie of learning; by reason that all naturally desire to know new things, strange, admirable, faire, and variable, and to vnderstand the causes therof; cherishing principally amongst all their senses, their sight and hearing, which do helpe them to haue knowledge, but the sight most of all, where hence hath begun this knowledge by admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; for seeing the Heauen, the Sunne, the Moone, the Starres; and hauing knowen by their eyes the difference of daies, and nights, the reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of the monethes, and the yeares; they applied themselues to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the disposition of the world, and to seeke out the secrets of nature: First, necessitie (as hath bin said) taught them the arts necessarie vnto life; after followed those which serue for pleasure, ornament, and magnificence: And after they had gotten opportunitie and leasure, they began to consider all things contayned in the world, being innumerable in multitude, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable in beautie; inquiring after their properties, agreements, and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, whereof they were made, what they became, when, and how they perished, what in them was mortall, and corruptible, and what diuine, and perpetual. They were so desirous to learne, that dwelling and liuing here on earth so little while, they durst vndertake to know, not onely what is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, vnder, and in the earth; as the nature of all sortes of liuing creatures, and qualities of mettals: but also the nature of the Ocean, and of all waters, and fishes that liue therein: Then mounting into the aire, they inquired of the winds, of the raines, haile, snow, thunder, lightning, and other accidents ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in the middle Region thereof: they ascended by vnderstanding and by art euen into Heauen, which they haue indeuoured to compasse round, imagining two Poles, and one Axeltree to sustain it, distinguishing the planets
<pb facs="tcp:13829:35"/>
from the fixed starres, inuenting the Zodiack, obseruing the Solstices, and Equinoxes; the causes of the equalitie, shortnes, and length of daies, and nights; the reasons of shadowes; the maner of discribing, and measuring the world; of sayling out of one Countrie into an other, guiding the way by the windes, and starres: whose mouings, coniunctions, and oppositions they haue diligently obserued; their greatnes, quicknes, or slownes, colours, shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, serenities, heats, colds; and the power which they haue on theis infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour things, and the good or ill which they signifie: And wholie and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the agreement, and sympathie of heauen, and earth; from whence as from a perpetuall spring floweth this vniuersall aboundance, by which this world is vncessantly restored, and renewed. Their industrie hath pierced thorough all; neither the thicknesse of the earth, nor the depth of the Sea, nor the varietie of the aier, neither the heat and brightnes of the fire, nor the spacious largenesse of Heauen, could amaze their vnderstanding. Moreouer, they which were most speculatiue, considering the feeblenes of the senses, the multitude of sensible things, so small that they can not be perceiued; or so moueable, that they are without certaintie; that our life is short; all full of opinions, and customes; and all enuironed with darknes, and hidden; haue thought that by humane discourse, nothing could be certainly knowen, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing vnderstood, and comprehended: but that, separating our selues from sight, and hearing, and from the whole bodie, we ought to take the thought of the mind, and by the vnderstanding (which is in the Soule, as the sight is in the bodie) to endeuour to know the reason of euery thing, and that which is in it pure and cleane, alwaies simple, and vniforme, without euer being changed by generation, and corruption. These haue passed the vault of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, so far distant from the earth, and came to the place aboue; with-drawing themselues by contemplation from the world towards God, from darknes to light, from corruption to eternitie, from ignorance to wisdom, satisfied (as they say) of all their desire; and inioying the knowledge of the trueth: which is of things that are alwaies alike, not receiuing any mutation; wherefore they haue called this inferiour part of the world, (where there is almost no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing certain, and few things certainly knowen) the region of falshod, and opinion: and the other superiour knowen by reason, and intelligence (where are the formes, and exemplaries of things) the seat of trueth. In this progresse of knowledge, they haue knowen some things by natural instinct, without learning; others by obseruation, vse, and experience: others by reasonable discourse, and demonstrations; and others by diuine inspiration. But there is such pleasure in this contemplation, that they which with a good will giue themselues to it, do easily forgo all other delights, and are so constant, and perseuerant, that they admit them not at any time; neither fearing domage, nor losse of goods, nor the blame of the people, and ignominie but are readie to endure all kind of crosses, and calamities, euen to the suffering of volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie pouertie: which gaue occasion to people in times past to say, that Atlas sustained heauen on his shoulders; and that Endymion had long time slept
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:13829:35"/>
with the Moone; and that Prometheus was tied to the high mountain Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casus, with a Vulture feeding on his liuer: Meaning by such tales to signifie vnto vs, the great and maruailous studie, which these excellent persons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed, in contemplation of celestiall and naturall things. Democritus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing begun to withdraw his mind from his senses, put out his owne eies. Anaxagoras forsook his patrimonie. What exceeding pleasure had Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, teaching not onely Athens, and all Greece, but also the vniuersal world, discouering the secrets of nature, before vnknowen, and hidden in profound obscuritie, magnifying and boasting himselfe with good reason, that he had attayned thither, whereno other Greeke nor Egiptian had euer come? What contentment receiued Plato, who did write at 90. yeares of age, and euen the verie day that he deceased; who was for his excellent knowledge honoured in Greece, Sicile, and Italie, aboue the common estimation of men, esteemed by Kings, admired of people: and hath alwaies bin reuerenced by all such as desired to haue knowledge of diuine and humaine things. So men mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by nature with a desire of knowledge, and of the pleasure which is found therein, haue inuented Grammer, Rhetoricke, and Logicke; for speach, Oration and disputation: Poesie for composition of verses, and rimes: Arithmeticke to number; Geometrie for measure and weight: And passing farther haue come to Musicke, consisting in concord of voices and sounds; and in obseruation of due proportions; Astrologie which serues for consideration of celestiall things; Physicke of naturall things; and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysicke of supernaturall: Theologie of diuine things; Ethicke for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of priuate maners; Economicke for houshold; Politicke for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernments, and states; and Nomotechnicke for knowledge, exposition or interpretation of Lawes. Such hath bin their dexteritie in the inuenting of liberall, and mechanicall sciences.</p>
            <p>But although there are euery where found people, capable of knowledge, so that they be duely instructed; yet notwithstanding, there are some more ingenious, and inuentiue then the rest, and more apt to certaine sciences, either by naturall inclination, and influence of the heauens, or by the situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Countrie wherein they are borne, or by exercise which they vse while they are young, or by honour which is nurse of all arts whatsoeuer, and the rewards which are proposed for the learned and expert therein.</p>
            <p>THE Babylonians dwelling in spacious plaines, and hauing nothing to hinder them the whole sight of the heauens, they placed all their studie in obseruing of the Starres: The like hath bin done by the Egiptians, who haue alwaies their aire cleare without cloudes: And by reason of the yearely ouerflowing of the riuer Nilus, which couereth and watereth their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, they were constrained to bestow some time on Geometrie. The Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicians being giuen to marchandize, inuented Arithmeticke; and dwelling neere the Sea, began first nauigation; which the Castilians, Portugals, and Englishmen, bordering likewise on the sea, haue brought to perfection. It was vnseemly amongst the Arcadians not to be skilfull in Musick; which
<pb facs="tcp:13829:36"/>
they learned not for pleasure and delight, but for necessitie, to thend to make sweete and gentle by custome, that which was rude in them by nature, by reason of the coldnes of the aire, whereof we participate in our birth, and by their continuance of trauaile, in tillage, pasturage, and brutishnes of life. Eloquence flourished at Athens, and at Rome, because that by means therof they were aduanced to honours and wealth. In Augustus time, who took pleasure in Poetrie, euery one made Verses: and all were Musitians, vnder Nero. The nations which desired to be great, and grow vp by armes, haue directed their Lawes and exercises to dominion, honouring and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensing valiant men, and dishonouring and punishing the cowardes: Such were the Scythians, Egiptians, Persians, Thracians, Lacedemonians, Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, Gaules, Iberians, Macedonians, and Indians, accounting all noble and gentle that made profession of armes; and the artisans base, and seruile. At this day in Turkie, where all is reduced vnto force, euery one applieth armes, being assured, that in well doing they shall be aduanced in pay, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenew, and publick charge: as also the punishment is certaine there for cowardize. The greatest part of good witts in France applie themselues to the Ciuil Law, and to the practize of it, for the profit which they find therein; and for the honour of innumerable offices of iudgement orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned both in the soueraigne, meane, and inferiour iurisdiction; being both profitable and honourable. The Hetrurians, which had their aire grosse and thicke, subiect to thunders, inuented the diuination by lightning. The Arabians, Cilicians, and Phrygians, being great shepheards, inuented that diuination which is made by entrailes of beastes, or by the voice of birdes. Philosophie hath bin professed in Greece, full of subtle and sharpe wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ts. Architecture began in Asia, by the abundance of wealth, and leasure of the great Kings there, hauing neede of large and ample houses for inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, and magnificence of their Courts: Afterwardes it flourished in Greece, whence it was banished; and from thence passed into Italie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couering his ripenesse there: namely, vnder the Emperours; who as they had subdued the rest of the world by armes, would also surmount them in wonderfull buildings with incredible expences. The Ethiopians, by the abundance of all good herbes, and vigorous simples, which grow in their Countrie, inuented the naturall Magick, obseruing by it, the wonders hidden in the secret proprieties of thinges; their agreements, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties. Plato in his Charmides, and his first Alcibiades maintayneth, that Zoroaster the Bactrian, and Zamolsis the Scithian, made profession therof: Then it was transported into Persia, where it remayned long; as we will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare hereafter when we speake of the Persians, and of their Mages.</p>
            <p>BVT as following the generall disposition to vertue, there haue alwayes bin heere and there some making profession of wisedome, as the Druides in Gaule, and in great Britayne; the Chaldees in Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria; the Brachmanes, and Gymnosophistes in the Indies; the Mages in Persia; the Priestes in Egypt; the Philosophers in Greece; the Pharisees
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:13829:36"/>
in Iurie; the Theologians or Diuines in Christendome: yet antiquitie hath giuen the first praise of Letters to the Ethiopians, attributing the inuention to them, which they communicated with the Egiptians their neighbours; where they haue bin augmented: from thence they came to the Libians, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians, and Chaldeans; consequently to the Greeks; then to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains; the Arabians, Italians, Frenchmen, Almains, Englishmen, Spaniards, and Polonians. ON which course of letters, if we think attentiuely as far forth as is possible to consider all the time past, and to call to mind againe the memorie of so many yeres ouerslipped, repeating from thence where in histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, beginneth the age of people, and of Cities; that is to say, about three or fower thousand yeares since men began to write bookes; we shall find that there hath not bin any Authour amongst the Gentiles, more auncient then <hi>Homer:</hi> And that letters haue not bin sithence with like earnestnes followed; nor in all times and countries equally esteemed: but onely in certaine famous ages, which we may tearme Heroicall. In the which (humaine power and wisdom, keeping companie one with the other) men haue commonly seen, the art Militarie, Eloquence, Philosophy, the Mathematicks, Physick, Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, Poetrie, architecture, painting, caruing, and grauing, to florish toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to fall together: as it hath especially hap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>WHERFORE is it so come to passe, rather at these times then at others? and what reason can we giue thereof? to thend the better to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the present consideration, being of so great waight, and long deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: It seemes to some, that we ought not to maruaile, that in an infinite space of time, as fortune turneth, and varieth diuersly, there hapneth by casuall chance, some accidents like vnto others. For be it that there is no certaine number set downe of accidents that may fall out; fortune hath fruitful mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enough to produce effects resembling one an other: or else be it that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine chances are comprehended in a determinate number, there must needs sometimes happen like cases, considering that they are brought to passe by the same causes, and by the same meanes: Others say, that in length of yeares are certaine periods of the whole world; and in thone, that all arts do grow in reputation, and in the other do fall, and come to be neglected. Others at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute it to honour, and to rewards, which are more proposed at one time then at an other: for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

in diuers exercises do obtaine alike excellencie, and reputation; they thinke that mens wits are nourished by emulation, and that sometimes enuie, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times admiration, doth stir them vp, and maketh them mount by little and little to the highest; where it is hard to remaine, since euery thing that can not go forward, or vpward, doth naturally discend, and retire, yea commonly much faster then it ascended. And as they are prouoked to follow or imitate the first, so after they dispaire of going beyond them, or attayning to them, they lose their courage of trauayling, and labouring with their hope; lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the matter as alreadie possessed: which falleth after by negligence, and commeth to contempt. Aristotle, who affirmeth the world to be eternall, and Plato, who said that it had a beginning, but that it should haue no end, do both affirme, that infinite things haue bin in one, and the same kind, and should bee infinitely; that there is nothing whose like hath not bin; that there should be nothing which had not bin; and that nothing hath bin, but should be againe: That in this maner the Arts and sciences, and other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine inuentions cannot be perpetual (those Nations being distroied where they flourished) by reason of extreme heats and inundations, which must needes happen at certaine times by the mouing, and progresse of the starres: either by the fire and water, discending from aboue in exceeding quantitie; or fire breaking out of the earth; or the sea forcibly ouerflowing his bankes, or by the increase and swelling of riuers, which can not runne into the sea; or that the earth trembling and quaking open it selfe, and violently cast forth the water before inclosed in his entrailes.</p>
            <p>But howbeit the Starres haue some power towards the disposing of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour things; the situation of places; and temperature of the seasons of the yeare do helpe, concerning vnderstandings and maners; the reward and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour proposed vnto mans industrie; the learned ages, and liberall Princes, giue great aduancement vnto Arts; and emulation serueth for a spur there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto: Notwithstanding for my part, I thinke that God being carefull of all the parts of the world, doth grant the excellencie of Armes and of Learning, sometimes vnto Asia, sometimes vnto Africk, sometimes vnto Europe; esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing the soueraign Empire of the world, once in the East, another time in the West, another time in the South, another in the North: and suffering vertue and vice, valiancie and cowardize, sobrietie and delicacie, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and ignorance, to go from countrie to countrie, honouring and diffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Nations at diuers times: to thend that euery one in his turne might haue part of good hap and ill; and that none should waxe proude by ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long prosperitie: as it will appeare to haue fallen out vnto this present, by particuler recitall of the Nations accounted the first or chiefest of the world.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Ntending to begin our discourse by the most auncient Nations of the world, I find my selfe hindered by the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, which hath bin betweene some of them, touching the honour of antiquitie, and of precedence.</p>
            <p>THE INDIANS inhabiting Countries of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous largenesse, did boast, that they were the true Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginaries; hauing neuer receiued any strangers among them; neither sent any of theirs to dwell elswhere: But that the first amongst them vsed such victuals, as the earth brought forth of it selfe, and skinns of beasts for their garments: and then found out by little and little, the Arts, sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and other things necessarie to liue well: That their land is so fertile, that they neuer found want of victuals. For whereas it bringeth forth twice in a yeare all maner of Corne, they gather one Haruest in winter, at such time as they plant rootes; and thother in summer, when they sow Rice, sesame, and millet; wherof there commeth great aboundance from thence, for asmuch as the graines and fruits grow there, without any help of man; and that the rootes growing in the marishes of singuler sweetnes, serue men in steed of other victuals verie sufficiently: and that the customes do helpe that fertilitie much, which they obserue in time of warres, not to hurt the husbandmen, nor endamage the laborers in any thing; but to leaue them in peace, as mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the common profit; and not to burne the farmes, and villages of their aduersaries themselues; nor to cut their trees, or corne which they had sowen.</p>
            <p>THE strength of the Indians appeared then, when they were assayled by Semiramis Queene of Assyria: for being a woman exceeding couetous of honour, and of glorie; after she had conquered Egipt, and Ethiopia, she thought yet to make one warre more, the memorie whereof should last for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer. Vnderstanding then that the people of the Indies, was the greatest of the world, and their Countrie aboue all others, excellent in beautie, and ferti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie: where the earth (as is said) caried twice in a yeare fruits and seeds; and where there was great quantitie of gold, siluer, brasse, precious stones, and all
<pb facs="tcp:13829:38"/>
other thinges, both for profit and pleasure: she imployed all her forces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Indians, ouer whom raigned Staurobates, and assembled her Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, in the which there were three Millions of foote, fiue hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand horsemen, a hundred thousand chariots, and as manie fighters on ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels-backs, with swordes of sixe foote in length; two thousand barkes or shipps, and made or fained Elephants in great number, whose counterfaits were caried on Camels. Which militarie preparation being vnderstood by the King of the Indians, he assayed to exceed her forces; and hauing ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all things in a readines for the resisting of her, he sent his Ambassadours before, reprehending her of great ambition, that without being prouoked by any wrong, or iniurie of them, she made warre against them: blaming her besides in many and diuers respects, and calling the Gods to witnesse, he threatned her, that if she were ouer come in battaile, he would cause her to be hanged and crucified. Whereunto Semiramis answered smyling, that they must fight with prowesse, and not with words. The battailes then appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching one against the other; Semiramis had the better in the first encounter: and in the second was ouerthrowen, with her counterfait Elephants; in such sort, that almost all the Assyrians being put to flight, Staurobates by chaunce meeting with Semiramis, hurt her first with an arrow i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the arme, and then with a dart in the shoulder, and as she was getting to horse, she was almost taken; the Kings Elephant pursuing her. The Assyrians in this maner ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, tooke the way to their ships, and the Indians pursuing their victorie, slew many of them at the straights, and narrow waies, in the which the footemen and horsemen being intermingled, hindred one an other: in so much that there was no meanes to flie, nor to saue themselues; but they kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led one an other with their presse and disorder. And when the greatest part of such as had escaped this ouerthrow were passed ouer the bridge, which was made with boates on the riuer Indus, Semiramis caused it to be broken; and the king being warned by prodigious apparitions not to go beyond the bridge, ceased the pursuit: Such was the proofe of the Indian power.</p>
            <p>Touching their wisdom, the Brachmans made profession therof amongst them naked, and austere; being holiemen, liuing according to their Lawes: intending altogether the contemplation of God, without making any proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of vittailes: for the earth furnished them alwaies with new and fresh; the riuers gaue them drink, and the leaues <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>lling of the trees, and the grasse yeelded them lodging. And there was not on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> amongst them reputed a holie or happie man, if while he was yet liuing of perfect memorie and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, he did not separate his soule from his bodie with fire, and did not go pure and cleane out of the flesh, hauing consumed whatsoeuer was mortall in him. And whereas the people were diuided into seauen sortes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, they were the first in dignitie, being exempted from all charges, not subiect vnto any man, nor ruling ouer any; but as men acceptable vnto the Gods, and reputed to knowe all that is done in Hell; they receyued of euery one his oblation made for sacrifices, and tooke the care and charge
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:13829:38"/>
of the dead, receiuing great guists by occasion thereof. Assembling and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering themselues togither at beginning of the yere; they fortold, of drouths, raines, windes, diseases, and other things: the knowledge whereof brought great profit to the people. Their Artisans were very good as being brought vp in a pure, and cleane aire, &amp; drinking nothing but good and wholsomewaters. The gouerme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the Indians, being diuided into many parts, it was not permitted vnto any to change his maner of liuing, not seeming reasonable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, that a man of warre should till the earth, nor that a Philopher should become an Artisan.</p>
            <p>On the other part, the ETHIOPIANS vaunted them selues to bee the first created of al the men in the world, &amp; that they were brought sorth by the earth: for considering that the heate of the sunne in drying the earth when it was moist, had giuen life to all things, it was also co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sequent that in places nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest vnto the su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, there were procreated from the beginning al kind of liuing creatures. They said that religion &amp; adoration of the gods was first sound out amongst them; and the sacrifices, processions, pompes, solemnities, and al such things, by the which honour was giuen them of men: of the which they had such reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pense, that they were neuer vanquished nor ouercom by any strange king; &amp; that alwaies they had remained in liberty. And howbeit diuers prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces had assaied with great armies to bring them in subiection, yet none of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had enioyed their Empire. Moreouer that they were the first that had inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the formes and vse of letters, and giuen themselues to the study of Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, as well by reason of their quick wits, and sharpnes of vnderstanding, whereby they exceed all other nations; as by the oportunitie of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey which they inhabite: and that therfore they haue continual serenity, and tranquility of the aire, and haue not the seasons of the yere, disordered, and variable; but liue alwaies in one temperature. Moreouer that the Egyptians were discended of them; the Priests of both nations obseruing the same order and maner of doing their sacrifices, &amp; vsing the like vestures, and ornaments.</p>
            <p>For the prerogatiue of antiquity there was in times past great contention between the Egyptians, and the Scythians. For the EGYPTIANS sayde; that from the beginning when the world was created, where other lands bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned on the one side by ouergreat heate of the sunne, &amp; others on thother side were frozen thorough the extremity of the colde, in such sort that they could neither bring forth new men nor receiue straungers, if any had come thither: and especially before garments were inuented to keepe men from colde, and heate; and the artificiall remedies to correct the ill disposition of places: Egypt hath alwaies bin so temperate, that the inhabitants thereof are not molested with the great cold of winter; nor with the heat of Sommer. Also the land is so fruitfull there of all thing necessary for the life of man, that not any where els is found a land so plentifull. Wherefore reason would haue it, that men should be first borne in that Countrey where they might best, and with most ease be nourished.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, the SCYTHIANS saide that the temperatnes serued
<pb facs="tcp:13829:39"/>
to no purpose to proue the antiquitie; for when nature parted, and deuided extreme heat, &amp; extreme cold into diuers regions; it is to be thought that the land which first remained vncouered &amp; vnclothed of theis two extreme qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, did incontinently bring forth men, and beasts, which might there bee nourished. And concerning trees, and other fruits they were varied according to the estate of the Countries. And for as much as the Scythians haue a shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per aire then the Egyptians, so are there bodies and their vnderstandings har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der also then theirs. Neuerthelesse, if the frame of the world which is now diuided into two partes hath bin sometime all one, whether the whole earth were inclosed and inuironed with water, or that the fire (which hath engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred all things) held and possessed the whole world, in both cases the Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians were the first: For if the fire possessed al, it must needs be that by little &amp; little it was quenched to make place for the habitable earth; In which case it is to be thought, that it was first quenched on the north side, because it is the coldest region, and the Scythians are seated there: whence it cometh to passe, that euen at this present it is the coldest countrey that is knowen. And in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of Egypt, and all the East, we must thinke that the heate was there but lately remitted; For yet at this day they haue meruailous heate there when the sunne is at highest. Also if the whole earth were at the first enuiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with water, it is to bee thought that the places that are hyghest were first discouered; and that where the earth is lowest, there the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter remained longest; and by consequent, that there where the earth was first discouered, and dryed, there began first all liuing things to be ingendred: But the countrey of the Scythians is higher then all other lands, as appeareth by this, that all the riuers which do arise there discend to the poole Meotis, and from thence do take their course into the Ponticke Sea, and into Egypt: which Countrey of Egypt is so lowe, and so subiéct to waters, that although so many Kings thoroughout so many ages, haue with great diligence, and expence, made so many rampyers, so many bankes, and dyches to keepe the land from being ouerflowen by the impetuosity of riuers: because that when they held them in on oneside, they ran out on the other, they haue so little preuailed that yet at this present, they are not able there to till the land; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the riuer Nilus be held in by Causwais, and bankes. And it is not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that this countrey did first of all bring foorth men, which notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the bankes and causies, yet by meanes of the mudde and dreggs which the riuer Nilus bringeth in and leaueth there, appeareth yet all waterie. By these reasons both thone, and thother nation maintained their antiquitie.</p>
            <p>But as concerning Egypt it is certaine that a part thereof was somtimes co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with water. All that which is aboue Memphis, towardes the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of Ethiopia, hath bin Sea by the opinion of Herodotus. And Strabo thinketh all the land which is from Siena vnto the Sea watered with the riuer Nilus, to haue bin at the beginning called Egypt, which was much increased, as one may see by the verse of Homer, sauing that the Isle of Pharos was a daies iourney distant from firme land: which is now euen almost ioyning to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:13829:39"/>
Alexandria. If these things be true, they show sufficiently that this land is not auncient. Neither can the Scythians proue their antiquity: If it be true that Herodotus sayth, that they began but a thousand yeeres before the raigne of king Darius ouer the Persians. But as both regions by the reasons debated, haue not bin very apt for habitation of men: so is it better to beleeue that land to haue bin first inhabited, which hath the aire most temperate: by which meanes the Egyptians said that they were most auncient. But as they by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the waters cannot alleage any auncient habitation, so neither can the Scythians because they dwell in a quarter which is afflicted with continuall colde. Wherefore it is more conformable vnto trueth to say that the middle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion betweene them both, where the territory of Damasco is situated, hath borne the first men: (as the holy Scripture witnesseth) which is exempted from the discommodities of Egypt, and of Scythia, and by reason of the situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation is naturally more temperate then either of them both. Otherwise it is hard by humaine knowledge, to know in what place, what people, or what nation hath bin the first; by how much space, or how many yeres it was afore the rest. Yet the opinion in times past touching the beginning of people was such; that at the beginning of all things the heauen, and earth had one onely essence, and forme; but that afterwarde the Elements being separated one from the other, the world tooke that order in which we see it now. Amongst which elements there befell into the aire that continuall motion which it hath; and to the fire for his lightnes that place which it hath aboue the aire; and for the same reason to the Sunne, &amp; stars, the course which they naturally keep. That which was mixed with moisture by reason of his heauines remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the same masse. Wherhence was created of the moistest the sea, &amp; of the hardest the earth being soft in it selfe, and myrie. Which when it was first dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and made thicker by the heate of the sunne, after by force of the heate lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vp, &amp; made to swell vpwards, there grew together in many &amp; diuers places therof certaine humours ingendring rottenes, couered and hid with thinne and tender skinnes. As generation then is made in moist thinges by adding heate vnto it; and the aire blowen abroade by night feedeth it with moisture, which is strengthened in the day time by the power of the sunne: finally these rotten things being come as it were to their extremity, brought forth (as if the time of their childbirth had bin come) the figures of all sorts of creatures and liuing things, after those little skinnes were broken. Of which liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures such as had receiued most heate were made flying birds, and mounted into the higher regions; those which had most earth remained as serpents, and such other beasts, below: they which retained the nature of water, were put in the element of their complexion, and called fishes: Then the earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made dryer from thence forward, as well by the heate of the sunne, as by the winds, left bringing forth any more such creatures. But those which were already made, begot others by continual commixtion. Men being thus formed sought their liuing in the fields leading a sauage life without any order: vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the hearbs &amp; trees brought forth of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues that which was necessarie
<pb facs="tcp:13829:40"/>
for their life. But the wild beastes became against them, and their enemies: in such sort, that to resist them and for their common profit, they began to assemble togither, giuing aide one to the other, and seeking here and there safe places for their habitation. And these first assemblies were the true begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of euery people and nation.</p>
            <p>THE CHALDEES very skilfull in Astrologie, held opinion that the world had alwaies bin, that it had no beginning nor should haue no end. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle hath bin of the same opinion, and that all liuing creatures were sempi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall. Plato in his third, and twelfth booke of lawes doubteth of the world, and of mankind, whether they were from the beginning or no; saying that the generation of men either had no beginning, or that it began an inestima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble length of time before vs. The same authour in his Timaeus, Critias, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexemus, and his Politick, is of opinion, that by long tracte of time, the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of mens minds, and fertility of their bodies diminisheth by little and little, in such sort that our vnderstandings find themselues as it were depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of their diuinity &amp; the bodies void of their accustomed fertility: The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God meaning to restore mankind into his former dignity, drowneth or burneth the earth, tempering in such sort the celestiall motions by himselfe which is their mouer, that the heauenly destiny giueth place and concurreth alwaies with his diuine prouidence. And that the earth being abundantly watered with fresh humour, and made fruitfull by the heat ensuing doth bring forth: or els that the rayne falling more plentifully after excessiue heates &amp; drouths, there are engendred, or regenerated not only little creatures, but great ones al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, being borne of the earth as of their mother: Of which opinion also were many Egyptians, Greekes, and Arabians, namely Algazel, and Auicen, with whom Aristotle agreeth in his Problemes, when he sayth, that in little muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of times little creatures are brought foorth, and so in the great greater, and very great in the greatest mutations.</p>
            <p>THE IEWES, CHRISTIANS, AND SAR AZENS, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the diuine prophet, and Lawgiuer Moyses, beleeue that God hath made the world of nothing, and created Adam the first man, after his owne likenes, of the dust of the earth, and breathed in his face that spirit of life, and that he was made with a liuing soule; afterwards meaning to giue him helpe, and company, made a profound sleepe to fall on him, and being a sleepe took one of his ribbes, and made Eue there of the first woman: That they were pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in an earthly paradise, where was plenty of all good things without pain or trauaile, aud were driuen from thence for their disobedience; and that of them two ioyned in mariage, haue proceeded all men dispersed ouer all the habitable earth. But Saint Augustine considering, that of the fiue zones set downe by the auncient Astrologers, and Cosmographers, there were but two esteemed temperate, and inhabited, and that from the one it was thought they could not passe to the other by reason of the heate, which was in the midst called the burning zone, and that if it were so, it must follow necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, that the Antipodes came not of Adam; he chose rather to deny that there
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:13829:40"/>
were any Antipodes, then to fall into any absurd impietie; or to gainesay learned antiquity in this point. But it is certaine both by the auncient and modern nauigations, that there are Antipodes, as those of Taprobana are to the Spanyards: which is knowen by the aspect of heauen, appearance of the starres, hyding of our pole, and eleuation of theirs, hauing (as hath bin said) euery thing contrary vnto vs, Sommer, and Winter, day and night, East and West.</p>
            <p>THE GREEKS in their fables said, that Vulcan being amorous of Minerua, shed his seed on the land of Athens, from whence spong the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians: who therefore vaunted themselues, that they were borne of their owne land without taking any original elswhere: vnderstanding by the earth al mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and by Vulcan the fire, which moueth the earth, and quickeneth it: and that Ceres after the rauishment of her daughter Proserpina, hauing wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red long throughout the world, came into their Countrey, where she show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them the vse of wheate, wherehence afterward it was manifested to all men: that their City hath not onely communicated such meanes of liuing to the indigent; but also was the first that established lawes; and set downe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment: and that in part it inuented the arts seruing for necessity, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; and in part hath approued them, or made them better, and more exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site: obtaining the honour of Philosophy, by which all theis things haue bin either inuented, or amended; and of eloquence which first tooke beginning in Athens, and hath there bin brought to perfection: that City hauing got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by wisedome and eloquence such excellency, and reputation, that her Scholers were Maisters of others; and that the name of Greeks was no more a name of a people or nation, but of reason and vnderstanding: and that the partakers of their learning were more esteemed Greekes, then those which participated of the same nature with them.</p>
            <p>At this day the wandring ARABIANS boast themselues to be the first of the world, hauing neuer bin mingled with other nations, and hauing kept entier (as they say) the nobility of their bloud.</p>
            <p>BVT OMITTING all these disputings, and boastings of nations, all fantasies, and humaine reasons of Philosophers; we will rest our selues on the certainty of holy scripture, touching the creation of the world, and of mankinde. And concerning the discourse of armes, and of letters which are here in question, we wil begin it by the Egyptians: who being ingenious and valiant, seeme to haue bin the first that haue excelled, in wisedome, and power: from whom the Greekes drew almost all their knowledge, which we vse at this day: hauing not onely in estimation, but also in admiration both Egypt, and the Egyptians.</p>

               </head>
               <p>AMongst others, Isocrates, that most excellent oratour, praysing Busiris, who made choise of that Countrey to raigne, in as the most commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of all the world, writeth thus: for considering other places not to be conueniently situated in respect of the nature of the whole world, but that some are too much subiect to raine, and others otherwaies molested; and that region to be in the fairest seat of the earth, and most abounding in all sorts of good things, and enuironed with the riuer Nilus, as with a naturall wall, which not onely keepeth, but fatneth it, being inexpugnable to straungers that assaile it, and much profitable to those which dwell neere it, by the wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings and other commodities which they receiue of it, whose industry also he hath made almost diuine in matter of tillage. For by his meanes they haue both raines and drouthes in their disposition: which are bestowed by Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter elswhere. Their felicity is so great, that if one consider the excellency, and goodnes of the Countrey and their spacious fields, he will thinke they inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite the maine land; if the commodities wherewith it aboundeth which are caryed out, and those which not growing there are brought in thither from other places, he will think that they dwell in an Island. For the riuer running here, &amp; there, and watering it thoroughly, doth furnish them with two mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous commodities. Busiris then began where wise men ought to begin, choosing a faire place which supplied all things needfull for the inhabitants aboundantly. Then diuiding them by orders, and estates, he appointed some for sacrifices, others for handy crafts, and others for warfare; thinking that ordinary necessities and commodities ought to be furnished by tillage, and by trades, but that the protection of them was most assured by the exercise of armes; and deuotion towards the Gods. Accomplishing then all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection required in a good law maker, he ordained that euery of them should alwaies exercise one trade, knowing that they which change oft, cannot vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand any thing well, nor do any thing perfectly; but those which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies conuersant about the same things, do commonly excell. Whence it is come to passe, that the Egyptians in euery art do excell so much all other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisans, as good workmen are wont to excel the vnskilful and ignorant. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer they obserue so good order in administration of their kingdome, and al other publicke gouernment, that the most famous philosophers disputing of such affaires, prefer the gouernment of Egypt aboue all theirs. Also to him we must refer as to the principal authour, the study and exercise of wisedom: for he so aduantaged the priestes first that they might maintaine themselues in chiefe place with the holy reuenues: that afterwards great holynes being by their lawes required of them, they might liue temperatly, and being exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from warfare, and other charges; they might rest in quiet.</p>
               <p>THEY enioying then this commoditie, haue inuented Physicke to helpe
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:13829:41"/>
the body; not that which vseth dangerous medicame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, but those which may as safely be taken as the daily meates; and neuerthelesse are so profitable that they which vse them are seene to be lusty, and able of body, and to liue long. And for medicine of the minde, they haue proposed the exercise of Phylosophy, which can make lawes; and search out the nature of thinges. Hee committed to the auncienter sort the best charges, and perswaded the yonger, leauing pleasures to, giue themselues to Astrologye, Arithmetick; and Geometry: which faculties are thought by some to be profitable in many things. The others indeuour to show that they follow vertue earnestly. Their piety, and deuotion towards the Gods is worthy of great praise, and admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For they which disguise themselues in such sort, that they may be the more esteemed thorough a show of knowledge, they hurt those whom they deceiue: But they which intermeddle in diuine matters, in such sort, that they make the rewards and punishments of the other life to appeare more certaine then the present, they profit men much. For they which at the beginning put such feare into vs, haue bin the cause of ceasing amongst vs all brutish wildnesse. Wherefore they rule these affaires so holily and reuerently, that oaths are more religiously obserued amongst them, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in other places; think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the punishment to be incontinently proposed for euery offence, except it be hidden for the present, and the auengement reserued for the children and posterity: wherein they doe not erre; for he hath ordained them many and different exercises of religion, setting downe by Lawe certaine beastes to be honoured and worshipped by them, which are dispised amongst vs: not that he was ignorant of their small power; but because partly he thought the common people was to bee accustomed to do what soeuer the prince commaunded them; and partely, because he would make triall in manifest things what they would do in those that were hidden: Iudging that such as would contemne them, would parauenture contemne greater also; and they which obserued order indifferently and equally in all things, did make proofe of their constancy in obseruing of religion.</p>
               <p>Many other things remaine to be said touching the holines of the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which haue not come to my knowledge alone, nor to me afore the rest: but many notable persons haue vnderstood them heretofore, and do vnderstande them now, of which number was Pythagoras the Samian, who went into E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, and was their disciple, and first brought Philosophy into Greece: hauing more care then any other of sacrifices, &amp; consecration in the Temples, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that if by it he obtained nothing the more of the Gods, at the least that he should be in a greater reputation amongst men: as it happened vnto him. For he hath bin so much esteemed, that all the yong men desired to be his Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and the auncient choose rather to haue their children in his schole, then at home to looke to their houshold; whereof we must not doubt. For euen at this day, such as say, they are his disciples are more esteemed holding their peace, then others that speake eloquently.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:13829:42"/>
Egypt, and how informing himselfe touching the auncient things of the priestes of that place, who vnderstoode them maruailously well; writeth that he found by experience that he, and the rest of the Greeks vnderstood nothing in respect of them: and that they were all yong of vnderstanding hauing no old opinion taken from antiquitie, nor any hoarheaded science. Then is summarily described the Egyptian gouernment: In the which first the priests were separated from the common people; and then the Artificers kept their occupations seuerally by themselues, and not indifferently ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led one amongst another. The like did the shepherds, hunters, and labourers. Also the men at armes and Souldiers were seperated from the rest, hauing no other charge, nor commaundement by the Law, but to follow armes. And moreouer what care the law had of prudence, and temperance, of diuination and of Phisick to preserue the health of the inhabitants; and of all other scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces agreeable.</p>
               <p>ARISTOTLE in his politicks co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firming this, saith that it is not new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or lately come to the knowledge of Philosophers, touching matter of state that a City ought to be deuided by exercises; and that there should be a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the Souldiers, and Labourers: For, this order, saith he, is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued yet in Egypt at this day, being so ordained by Sesostris.</p>
               <p>PLVTARCH in his discourse of Isis and Osyris writeth, that in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt the kings were chosen either of the order of the priests, or of the men of warre: because thone order was reuerenced and honoured for valiancy; and thother for wisedome: and he that was chosen from amongest the men at armes, presently after such election was also receiued into the order of priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and to him were communicated and discouered the secrets of their Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, which couered many misteries vnder the vaile of fables, and vnder tales which obscurely showed the trueth; taking heed warily least they should profane their wisedom, in publishing too much that which appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the knowledge of the Gods: which is witnessed by the wisest &amp; most learned men of Greece, Solon, Thales, Plato, Eudoxus, Pythagoras, and as some say Lycurgus himselfe; which we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of purpose into Egypt to confer with the priests of that Countrey: That Pythagoras was wel beloued of them, and he also esteemed them very much; In so much as he would ymitate their my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall fashion of speaking in hidden words, and hide his doctrine and his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences vnder figured, and enigmaticall words, those letters which in Egypt are called Hieroglyphick being almost al like vnto the precepts of Pithagoras.</p>
               <p>HERODOTVS the historian speaking in his Euterpe of the Egyptians affirmeth those which inhabite the fruitfullest Countrey to be the most poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and of the best vnderstanding of any that euer he was acquainted with. And that in truth they were the most healthsom next to the Africans, because the seasons of the yere change but little; diseases being bred in men by sodaine changes; and especially by the changing of those seasons. That it was giuen him to vnderstande by the Priestes, that in three hundred fortie and one generations they had so many Kinges, and highe Priestes, and that in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:13829:42"/>
the space of one thousande three hundred and fortie yeeres, the sunne had foure times changed his accustomed course, arising twice in the west part, and setting also twice in the East; and that yet notwithstanding Egypt had not changed any thing, neither in the fruitfulnesse of the ground, nor in the nature of the riuer: nor yet in diseases, nor terme of life and death. In such reputation haue the Egyptians bin amongest the best learned of Greece.</p>
               <p>TOVCHING themselues they boasted that they had inuented Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, Arithmeticke, Geometry, and many other sciences; and that the best Lawes had bin inuented by them: especially the Thebanes, the situation of their Countrey helping them greatly being plaine and without cloudes to knowe the mouings of the starrs which arise, and fall. And they haue so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently obserued the eclipses of the sunne, and moone, that by them they haue first prognosticated many things to come, foretelling often (to thend men might the better preuent it) the scarsitie or aboundance of Corne, and fruits, the imminent maladies both of men and beasts, the earthquakes, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of Comets, and other things that were hard to be knowen: which were certaine vnto them, by long and continuall experience. This was the true and proper office of their priestes, who were in great authority as wel because they had the charge of diuine thinges: as for that they were full of knowledge, and taught others. And whereas the whole publicke reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new was diuided into three partes; they tooke the first portion, to thend to employ it in administration of sacrifices, and on their necessities: They were called neere vnto Kings to giue counsaile in matters of consequence, both they and their children being exempted from subsidies: and holding the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d place to the king in honor &amp; dignity. Thother portion of the reuenew appertayned to the Kings, who employed it on the warres, and on main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining their estate, and traine, and in recompensing such as deserued: whence it came to passe, that the people was not any way oppressed with tributes, and new subsidies. The third part was receiued by the nobles, and other men of armes; wherein they were all exercised, to the end that by such intertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they should be the readier to vndertake all military hazards, and that ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing better thereby, and more at ease, they should be the more enclined to beget offspring of their bodies: whence it came to passe that the Countrey being peopled by theis meanes had no need of forraine Souldiers. They neuer learned any base or mechanical science, but gaue themselues wholy to armes: which exercise was taught from hand to hand, by the father to the sonne. Concerning their arts and handycrafts; the Egyptians workes were very wel wrought, and euen come to their perfection; for the Artisans of Egypt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed themselues onely about workes which were permitted by the Law, or which they had learned of their fathers: And it behoued euery one to showe to the gouernour from yere to yere whereof he liued: Otherwise for default of so doing, or not shewing his manner of liuing to be iust, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable; he was led presently to death. And whereas that Countrey was more stored with people then any other of the world, and furnished with
<pb facs="tcp:13829:43"/>
such excellent Artisans; their kings haue built such great Cities as Thebes, and Memphis, and erected and made meruailous pyramides, temples, laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Furthermore the countrey of Egypt hath alwaies seemed to be the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent of all others; as well for that it is meruailously strong, and wel boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; as for the pleasing beauty of the whole Countrey. For on the West side it hath the great deserts for defence, and a part of the wylde Lybia; which is not only difficult to passe ouer, but very daungerous also for want of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and barennes of all other thinges: Towards the South it is enuironed with the scluses of Nilus, and with the mountaines adioyning. And to come downe from the higher Ethiopia, for the space of three hundred leagues, the riuer is not easily nauigable, nor the way by land easy to be vndertaken: if it be not by a king; or with great prouision of victuals. On the East side it is fortified with the sameriuer, and with a deepe and hollow marish ground, more then twelue leagues in length being betwixt Syria, and Egypt. On the North it is enclosed with a Sea which hath no hauens, and where it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry difficult to finde landing. Being by this meanes very safe and strong, it was first grouerned by the natiue Kings of the Countrey: after by the Ethiopians, Persians, Macedonians, Romains, Greekes, Caliphes, Soudans, and at this day by the Turkes.</p>
               <p>Amongst all the Kings borne in the countrey or aliens, which euer raigned there SESOSTRIS was the most mighty &amp; most magnificent; hauing excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in valiancy, and felicity, not onely the Assyrians, and Persians, but also the Macedonians, and Romaines. His father being aduertised by reuelation of his greatnes to come, to the end to make him worthier to rule the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy of the whole worlde, he assembled togither all the children that were borne on the same day with his sonne, &amp; caused them al to be instructed in the same discipline with him: thinking that being so brought vp togither, they would loue one another the more; &amp; be the better help to one another in the wars. First of al then, going against the Arabians with an army of these, being hardned with pain, &amp; accustomed to sobriety, he brought vnder his obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce al that nation which was free &amp; at liberty before; then the greatest part of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia, being yet very yong: &amp; lifted vp in courage by the succes of this expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he applyed al his fantasy to make himselfe Lord of al the world, gathering togither an army of sixe hundred thousand foot, foure and twenty thousand horse, eighteen thousand chariots for war, &amp; foure hundred ships on the red sea; finding out first the vse of galleis: ouer all whom he appointed Capitains the most part of those which had bin brought vp with him (as is fayde) accustomed vnto warre, and from their youth giuen to vertuous exercises. With this great force hee conquered on the one side Ethiopia, and all the Isles of that Countrey, and all the Sea-coast towardes the Indies; on the other side Asia the great: ouercomming not onely those nations which were
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:13829:43"/>
afterward ouercome by Alexander; but also many other whom Alexander neuer came vnto. For he passed the riuer Ganges, marching here and there thorough out all the Countrey of the Indians, vnto the great Ocean; and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersed all the Scythians countrey vnto the riuer Tanais, which de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ideth Asia from Europe. Then going therehence into Thrace, he was constrained by the difficulty of the places, and thorough want of victuals to make an end of his enterprise, setting vp diuers pillars in the conquered Countries; some with the likenesse of a man, others with the secret parts of women; sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying thereby the valiancy, or cowardize of the vanquished people. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning into Egypt with all the prisoners whose number was infinite, and the spoiles of the conquered Countries, he decked the Temples of Egypt with the most precious things which he had brought: and hauing recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed his souldiers which had well followed and serued him, from that time forward the whole Countrey was much enriched. Being at quiet he did also many great and excellent things, seruing for the ornament, and safety of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt: as to raise mounts, on which the townes were placed, which before were low seated; to thend that the men and beastes might remaine in safety during the increase of the riuer: make great diches and chanels in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey going from Memphis to the Sea, to cary victuals more easily and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: fortifie those places where the enimies might enter on the land of Egypt making their entrance more difficulte by multitude of diches: build a great wall toward Syria, and Arabia, from Peluse to the City of the Sunne, foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score and fourteene leagues in length. But hee exceeded all other magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence in this, that when the nations which hee had ouercome, and those to whome hee had giuen kingdomes; as also the Capitaines which hee had ordained for the guard of his prouinces, were come into Egypt, at the time appointed to offer their gifts &amp; tributes which they ought him; if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that he went to the temple, or passed thorough the towne, he made fower of them to be tyed and fastened to his chariot in steed of horses: declaring thereby that none of the other kings or famous Capitaines, was to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him in vertue, seeing he had ouercome them all. His glory and renowne was so great, that long time after he was dead, when the Persians held the kingdome of Egypt, and Darius the father of Xerxes would haue placed his owne statue aboue that of Sesostris in the City of Memphis: the high Priest of Vulcan gainsayd him publickly, saying that yet his acts were not like to those of Sesostris, who had subdued as many nations as he; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst others had ouercome the Scythians, whom Darius could not any waies endamage; and therefore it was not reason that his offering should go before that of a King whom hee had not gone beyond in great exploits. Which words Darius taking in good part, and reioycing at his so liberall speach, said that he would indeuour not to be inferiour to Sesostris in any thing, if he liued as long as he had done; praying the priest to compare their yeres with their deeds, and that it should be a testimony vnto him of his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. After Sesostris, in my opinion Ptolomeus Philadelphus deserueth greatest
<pb facs="tcp:13829:44"/>
praise, by the fauour, and aduancement which he gaue to all arts: founding that most famous schoole in Alexandria the head City of his kingdome, to communicate to all students the sciences, (which before were only managed by Priests, and handled in the Egyptian tongue) which he caused to be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated into Greeke; where he assembled from all parts learned men to teach them, proposing them honourable rewards: there built he that magnificent <hi>Museum,</hi> which he endewed with good reuenues, for the intertainment of Scholers; and erected in it that most famous Library, furnished with seuen hundred thousand volumes: which foundation was after augmented by the Romain Emperour; and continued euen till the Mahometans vsurped that kingdom; whence they banished both the Greeke tongue, and the auncient Egyptian with their sciences; though they had bin there continued almost three thousand yeres, especially the knowledge of celestiall motions, and of naturall thinges: amongest the variable accidents of so many monarchies as of the Ethiopian, the Egyptian, Assyrian, Median, Persian, Macedonian, Parthian, and Romain.</p>

               <p>IN ASSYRIA raigned in olde time many Kinges borne in the same Countrey, whose names and deedes are both abolished by long course of yeres. But he amongst them which first got learned men to writ his deeds, was NINVS, who being by his nature enclined to warre, and greedy of glory, subdued the first nations by force, and inuested himselfe with the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, stretching out his dominions farr and wyde thorough out Asia with an incredible army of seuenteen hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred thousand foot, 2. hundred thousand horse, ten thousand sixe hundred chariots armed with hookes: by meanes whereof he subdued in seuenteene yeeres all the nations bordering on the bankes of the East sea, and their neighbours; as the Egyptians, Phenicians, those of the inner Syria, Cilicia, Pamphilia, Lycia, Caria, Mysia, Lydia, Troada, Phrygia, which lyeth on the Sea Hellespont, the Countrey of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pontida, and Bithinia, Capadocia, and the other nations which border on the great Sea; not leauing any vnconquered, from Nilus to Tanais.

And assembling from all
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:13829:44"/>
partes great number of workemen, with the prouisions necessary for such a worke, he built his Citie on the riuer Euphrates, making it not altogether square, nor equally compassed on all sides, of alike length; but longer on two sides, then on the other two; and each side of the long wall was twenty miles in length, and a side of the lesser wall not much lesse then twelue miles, so that it had in all three score and two miles in circuit: And without doubt Ninus was no whit deceiued of his intent: for there hath no Citie si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence bin found of so great compasse; neither of such sumptuousnes, beautie, and magnificence. Then to make it populous, and well inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, hee compelled the Assyrians, especially those of the richer sort, to make their abode there: and of other neighbour nations receiued such as would come thither: ordayning that the Citie in memorie of him should be called NINIVIE.</p>
               <p>After whose death SEMIRAMIS his wife held the kingdome of Assyria, showing her selfe as magnificent in riches, conquests, and trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes, as euer any man had bin: It is said, that being a little girle, she was cast into a desert full of rockes, where there was a great number of birdes, which by gods will nourished and preserued her; bearing vp the child with their winges, and feeding her with milke, and after with cheese, which they stole from the shepcotes adioyning: which being discouered by the shepheardes, who found their cheeses to be gnawen, and perceyuing the child to be of excellent beautie, they offered her to their gouernour: who hauing no children, brought her vp carefully, as if she had bin his owne; afterwards being growen, by reason of her beautie, and good behauiour, she came to the knowledge of king Ninus, hauing holpen him by her dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teritie to take the Citie of the Bactrians; so that he fell in loue with her, and maried her: Yet was not her death lesse admirable then her strange nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment; for after she had made great Conquests, buylded sumptuous edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, assailed the Indians with an armie of three Millions of foote, fiue hundred thousand horsemen, and a hundred thousand chariots, (as hath bin said) and at her returne giuen order for gouernment of her kingdom, she vanished away, and was transported sodainlie (as hath bin beleeued) amongst the Gods. Some faine, that she was turned into a Pigeon, and that she flew away with a great number of birdes, which came into her chamber. Desiring to match, or to goe beyond her husband in glorie and magnificence, shee vndertooke also to buyld the Citie of BABYLON, assembling artisans from all partes: as Cutters, Caruers, Masons, and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maisters for this effect; and making prouision of stuffes necessarie for so great a buylding; which to make vp and finish, shee caused from all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to come to the number of three Millions of men; and built her Citie on both sides of the riuer Euphrates, which passed thorough the midst of it; ouer which shee made a bridge halfe a mile in length, and of thirtie foote in bredth, and two palaces at the two endes thereof: The walles were fortie fiue miles round about, hauing many towers of equal distance one from
<pb facs="tcp:13829:45"/>
the other, which were three-score and one fadome in height; and a hundred gates all of brasse, with their hinges and pillers. The Citie was diuided into streets, the most part straight, full of houses of three and fower stories high, of palaces, castles, and temples, correspondent to such greatnes and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, with altars, statues, tables, and other ornaments of incredible riches: which the succeeding kings augmented, vntill the vsurpation of the Persians, which took away part, and ouerthrew the rest. Herodotus affirmeth, that it was the greatest and strongest of all others next after Niniuie; and that it was the fairest that euer he saw. By such works of Ninus and Semiramis it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that Architecture, and all manual sciences were then in great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and estimation. BELVS the father of Ninus was the first obseruour of the Starres in those parts, and ordayned the Priestes, Naturalists and Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers. ZOROASTER king of the Bactrians, whom Ninus ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came in battaile, was the authour of Magick. And according to the suppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Eusebius, ABRAHAM was the first founder of true Religion, the first that fulfilled the Law of nature, and thought of the diuine Law; the first that perswaded men to worship one onely God against the Pagans, and Idolaters; &amp; the first that draue away the darknes of errour, &amp; vndertook warres against the wicked: for this cause he receiued so much honour, that God spake vnto him, and promised to multiplie his posterity, aboue the starres of heauen, and sandes of the sea, and that in his seed all Nations should be blessed; comming thereof the redeemer of the world, which before was vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly lost and ouerthrowen: of which promise, both the Mosaical and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Law took their beginning: And Mahomet himselfe to couer his deceit, and win the more people, said; that he preached no other thing, but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of Abraham, which he pretended to restore.</p>
               <p>BVT young NINVS their sonne, taking the kingdom after them, and making peace with all his neighbours, liued in pleasure, and idlenesse out of the sight of men, shut vp for the most part in his pallaice: But for the safetie of his kingdom, and that he might be feared of his subiects, he leuied euery yeare a certaine number of souldiers, and out of euery prouince ordayned them a Captaine. And when all his armie was assembled without the Citie of Niniuie, he appointed ouer euery Nation an other Captain of the wisest and skilfullest of those that were about him. The yeare being ended, he sent home his first souldiers to their houses, and had others out of the prouinces: whence it came to passe, that his subiects were the readier to obey for feare, which they had of the souldiers remayning alwaies in the field: And if any had failed of their duetie, or rebelled against him, they were readier also to make satisfaction for feare of punishment. Thinking also that such changing from yeare to yeare, might serue to this end, that his souldiers and Captaines might not so readily knit themselues together to conspire against him: for to be continually in the field exercised in the art militarie, maketh the souldiers harder and stronger, and the Capitains wiser, which hath often bin an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to them of departing from the obedience of their common wealth, or
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:13829:45"/>
seruice of their Prince: which point was ill considered of the Romains, when they liued in a common wealth; and afterward by their Emperours. For the prolongation of generall charges in warre, by succession of time distroied the common wealth by two inconueniences: The one, that by this meanes lesse number of people was exercised in militarie charges, and offices; and by consequence the reputation restrained to fewer persons: The other, that one man alwaies commanding ouer an Armie, made it partiall and affectionate vnto him, so that in time it forgot the Senate, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged no head but him: So did Sylla, and Marius find souldiers to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them against the publike weale: So Iulius Caesar by the continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which was made him of his charge in Gaule, had meanes to seize on his owne Countrey. Likewise the ordinarie armies which the Emperours in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertayned, aswell neere vnto Rome, as on the frontiers of the Empire, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrew many of them, and the Empire also; setting vp Caesars, and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them downe at their appetite, hauing sometime chosen many of them in diuers places, at the selfe same time; whereof great warres arose. This king then, to the end to prouide for such inconueniences, established (as hath bin said) the Captaines of his armie, the Gouernours of prouinces, the Stewards of his houshold, and other officers of his house; and also the Iudges of euery prouince, and other charges of his estate: thinking as for the rest, that the Prince his vnknowen maner of lyuing, made his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures secrete, and that none dared to blaspheme him; as if he were God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisible.</p>
               <p>Wherein he was followed by the other succeeding Kinges, euen till SARDANAPALVS, in whose time this kingdome was translated to the Medians. He was the most effeminate that euer was borne, so that he abode alwaies amongst women, handing the distaffe, and spinning in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manish apparell; more wanton in lookes, in apparell, and gesture, then the most wanton of them; to whom he diuided their workes, cloathing himselfe sometime with a crimson gowne, and sometimes with fine Tissue: He painted his face, and his whole bodie, and counterfaited his speach after the imitation of women: He did not onely desire to haue euery day meates and drinkes to prouoke him to lust, but gaue himselfe wholly to pleasure, abusing sometimes the office of a man, and sometimes of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; without all honestie, without regard of sexe, or of shame; in such sort, that beeing altogether drowned in delights, he scarse shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe abroad at any time. These fashions were the cause, that two of his Lieutenants, Beloch the Babylonian, and Arbaces the Median, had him in disdaine; and conspiring against him through contempt, made warre against him, after they had diffamed him as loose, and effeminate: who at last presented himselfe against his will in battaile in the field, with his effeminate companie, without order: but hauing had the worst, he withdrew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe hastily into his royall pallace, in the which he caused to be raised in

a back and secret roome, a peece of timber work; being of great peeces of wood, fower hundred foote high, in maner of a Pyramis, and within left a great space void: In such sort, that in the midst there was an other place made of Carpenters worke, furnished with great and long tables, and was large a hundred foote square, which is fower hundred foote round: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>within he caused to be set fower hundred couches of gold, which serued to make magnificent bankets, after the old sashion; and aboue ouer against them as many tables of gold. But the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ower was girt in such sort, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed with great and heauie stuffe, that there was no going out, nor opening, but onely to haue light from the top: This being done, he made his wife, and his Concubines, and the women of his Court which he loued best, to enter into it; not knowing, nor doubting any thing what he meant to do; then went he in himselfe, and there caused himselfe to be shut in, without hope of euer going out: But before, he had caused to be brought thither a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand myriades of gold, and a myriade of myriades of siluer, and a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of royal vestures, and precious stones. Then his Chamberlaines, and Eunuches (in whom he put all his trust, and of whom he had taken oathes to do it) put fire in this pile, which endured fifteene daies: So Sardanapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus burned himselfe with all his riches, doing in that thing onely the act of a man. Budeus valuing it all after our maner, accounteth that he spoyled the earth, or would haue spoyled it, of the value of fiftie Milions of gold. These two Lieutenants diuided afterwards the Monarchie betwixt them; Beloch was king of Babylon; and Arbaces of the Medians. Aristotle in his politicks, doubting of the end of Sardanapalus, and of the Kingdom of Assyria, saith, that if that had not hapned vnto him, which is reported, yet that it might befall to any other king, gouerning himselfe after that sort. Moreouer, the Chaldees in Assyria were appointed to haue care of holie things; and did nothing but studie all the time of their life, being reputed verie skilfull in Astrologie. Many among them did prognosticate things to come, as if they were Prophets, and were wont to know how to diuert euill fortune com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming towards men, and to bring them good by sacrifices, and praiers. Besides they expounded dreames, soothsayings, and prophecies: wherein they were verie expert, as hauing bin brought vp therein; and taught by their fathers; still continuing and perseuering in the same: for dwelling in plaine coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, where the aire is commonly without clouds, or raine, and where there are no hills to hinder the sight of the heauens, they had meanes to applie themselues wholieto contemplation of the Starres, obseruing their mutual concursions; how they approach or recoile thone from thother; what are their conjunctions and oppositions, and what becommeth of them, in what seasons, and how they are hid, and then appeare againe; the signes of good or ill fortune to come, which they bring in particular to euery person, and in generall to townes, and to peoples. In which obseruations they affirmed that they had imploied CCCC lxxiij. thousand yeares: from the time when they began them, vntill Alexander the great went vp into Asia: which space is
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:13829:46"/>
incredible. Neuertheles, all agree in this, that the Chaldees were most skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the doctrine of the heauens, because they had continued the studie thereof longest. Plato in his Epinomides, acknowledgeth Astrologie to haue bin begun in Syria, and Egipt, where by the serenitie of the summer season, almost all the starres are cleerely seen; and that time out of mind the obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of starres had bin there continued, and there hence brought ouer to the Greeks. Notwithstanding, Simplicius a Greek Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentator on Aristotle wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth, that Aristotle did write vnto Calisthenes, being in the armie of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander, that while others were busied about the spoile, and pillage of Babylon, he should diligently inquire of the antiquitie of the Chaldees; and that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listhenes answered, that after hauing imploied all diligence therein, he found their historie not to exccede the terme of one thousand nine hundred and three yeares. Others do not onely attribute to the Chaldees the praise of Astrologie, but also of many other Arts; and that Prometheus of that nation, for hauing showed the mouings of the Planets, and opened the misteries of nature, was accounted vnder the couerture of a fable, to haue stolne out of heauen the sacred fire of Pallas; and to haue giuen a soule vnto man, which he had fashioned before of earth: After that in reuenge herof, and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this boldnes, he was had by Mercurie to the high mountain Cauca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, and fastned to a great rock: signifying his great assiduitie in contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Heauen, and of nature. Now the Chaldees held opinion, that the world had alwaies bin, that it had no beginning, and should haue no end; the order and forme of all things being made by the diuine prouidence: and that the celestial affaires are not casually or naturally guided; but by the firme and determinate will of the Gods: saying, that the greatest force, and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of heauen, doth consist in the planets; and that the knowledge of such euents is knowen, aswell by their ascendents, as by their colours. Sometimes they showed visiblie, to peoples and countries, to kings and priuate persons, such things as might helpe them, or harme them; gathering the certaintie therof by the windes, or by the raines; sometimes by the heats, and by the Comets, by the Eclipses of the Sunne, and Moone, and by many other signes seruing greatly for the birth of men, to haue good fortune or bad; and that by their nature and proprietie, especially by their aspect, one might easily know things to come: hauing told vnto Alexander, that he should fight with Darius; and after to Antigonus, Nicanor, Seleucus, and other Kings; and likewise to priuate persons so euidently, that which was to happen vnto them, that it seemed a miraculous thing, and aboue the vnderstanding of man. But when the raigne of the Assyrians failed, the Medes on the one side, and the Babylonians on the other, ruled in Asia: who followed the maners and customes of those which were their Lords before; hauing no peculiar singularitie either in armes or letters: and therefore I will dwell thereon no longer. Besides that, these affaires are so auncient, and so far from vs, that many esteeme as fabulous whatsoeuer is written thereof: Wherefore I will come to the Persians, who are better knowen; and to the raigne of Cyrus
<pb facs="tcp:13829:47"/>

               </head>
               <p>THE PERSIANS were first shepheards, bornin a hard countrie, which made them strong; inabling them to remain in the open field, to watch and trauaile in the warres: They did eate nothing ordinarily but bread and herbes, with some venison; hauing neither figgs, nor any other fruit, by reason of the rudenes, and barrennes of their countrie: They drank no wine, but contented themselues with water, euery one carrying his dish to drink it in, when thirst came vpon him. They took no refection nor repast, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing of some exercise before, which was principally hunting: Their children went to schoole to learne Iustice; as they do in other Countries to learne Letters. All their habit or rayment was of skinns; aswel for their leggs as for the rest of the bodie.</p>
               <p>HERODOTVS bringeth in ARTEMBARES speaking thus to the Persians; Seeing that Iupiter hath giuen you the Monarchie, and to thee CYRVS, power to distroy Astyages; go yet further: for the land which we hold is little, hard, and barren; and we must go from it, to win a better els<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. There are many neere about vs, and many farther remoued from vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the which, if we once possesse but one; we shall be admirable to many others. And surely men that rule, ought to think on these things: for when shall we haue better occasion, then when we are Lords ouer many men, and ouer all Asia? CYRVS hearing these words, commaunded they should be put in execution: but in commaunding, warned them also to prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues not to rule; but to be ouerruled: for it is so, that soft Countries make soft people; because it is not proper to one land, to beare both delectable fruits, and valiant warriours: Then the Persians repented them, chosing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to rule dwelling in an vnfruitfull land, then to serue others, sowing and labouring of the faire fieldes. The same CYRVS in Xenophon, showeth his people, that watching, and trauayling, enduring of labour, and vsing of diligence, had enriched them: Wherfore saith he, it behoueth also that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after you be vertuous; holding for certaine, that great goods, and great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments will come vnto you, by obedience, constancie, vertue, paines-ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and hardines in vertuous, and perilous interprises. CYRVS then is he, which first put the Persians in reputation, making them Lords ouer the Medes; whose vassals and tributaries, they were before.</p>
               <p>But as in all the great effects of nature, and notable mutations of mankind, God raiseth vp ordinarily great, and excellent Princes, adorned with rare vertues, lifted vp in great aucthoritie, to found Kingdomes, and Empiers; to bring in good lawes, and maners of liuing in Religion, and politike gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and to further the arts and sciences: whose birth and death are foretold
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:13829:47"/>
long time before, by oracles, prophecies, and signes in Heauen and earth: and after their death, reuerenced with diuine honours. So GOD mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning then to establish in Asia a most mightie Monarchie, and to bring Philosophie into the world, at the same time; he raised vp CYRVS, as praise-worthie a Prince, as any other hath bin either afore, or after him. It is he alone amongst all the great Lordes and Captaines, of whom hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories do make mencion, that could obserue modestie in all his prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and victories; and bridle his absolute power and aucthoritie, with equitie and clemencie. But from whence may wee haue a more certaine testimonie of his excellencie, then from the Propher <hi>Esay,</hi> where he was named two hundred yeares before he was borne; and is called of GOD his king, promising to hold his right hand, that hee might take stronge Townes, and subdue mightie Nations, and humble the great Kings of the earth. And he chose him amongst all the Princes of the Gentils, to reedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Temple of Ierusalem, and deliuer the Iewes from the Captiuitie of Babylon, in the which they had long remayned; restoring them to their full libertie, and vse of the true Religion.</p>
               <p>The words of <hi>Esay</hi> are these. <hi>The Lord saith thus to CYRVS his anoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: I haue taken the right hand, that I may subdue the Nations before his face, and that I may weaken the raines of Kings, that the dores may be opened before him, and that the gates be not shut. I will go before him, and make the crooked waies straight. I will breake the gates of brasse, and will bruse the barres of yron, and will giue the treasures laied vp, and the thinges hid in secret places: that thou maist know that I am thy Lord the God of Israell, calling thee by thy name, for my seruant Iacobs sake, and for Israell my chosen. I haue named thee by thy name, though thou neuer knowest me.</hi> But though fortune were verie contrarie to him at the beginning; yet did GOD neuer forsake him: but following the prophecie, deliuered him from many dangers, and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences. ASTYAGES king of the Medes had a daughter called Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dana, of whom he dreamt in his sleepe, and it seemed vnto him that he saw her make water in such abundance, that she filled all the Citie of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batane, and from thence watered and ouerflowed all Asia: He proposed this vision to some of his Mages, expounders of dreames, and was afraied with that which he learned of them: Wherefore, when Mandana was of yeares to be maried, hee would not giue her to any Median Lord, but gaue her to a Persian, whom he found of a good house, and of sweet and peaceable maners; though he esteemed him lesse then a Median of meane estate. Mandana beeing maried to this Persian, called Cambyses, the first yeare of their mariage Astyages had an other vision, and dreamed that he saw a Vine comming out of the wombe of his daughter, and spreading ouer all Asia: which he proposed to the deuiners, as before, and hearing them, sent into Persia for his daughter, being alreadie with child; who being come, he commaunded she should be carefully kept, purposing to put her child to death: because the Mages had told him, that the sonne of
<pb facs="tcp:13829:48"/>
his daughter should one day raigne in his place. Wherefore, as soone as she brought forth a child (who was called CYRVS) he appointed Harpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus his greatest fauorite, and trustiest seruant, to put him to death; who gaue him to a Shepheard, to be exposed for a pray to wild beastes: which the shepheard did, and left him in the midst of a forest, wrapped in a blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket of cloth of gold, and a mantle of diuers colours: whither retourning afterward, he found a bytch by the child, which gaue him suck, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended him from the beastes. Wherefore, beeing moued with the same pitie which moued the bitch, he brought the cradle into his Cabin, and nourished the child as his owne, till he was ten yeares of age; when he was chosen king amongst the children: In which charge, bearing himselfe more brauelier then the estate of a shepheards sonne yeelded, in appointing to euery one their offices, and estates; some to buyld him houses, and castles; others to be of his gard; one to be as the eye of the king; another ordayned to make report vnto him of the gouernment of his affaires; and chastising roughly such as disobeyed him; he became knowen, and was brought back againe to Astyages: who brought him vp, thinking his dreame to be accomplished in this childish royaltie.</p>
               <p>But being woxen greater, he became most warlike; and hauing at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his conquests but thirtie thousand fighting men; afterwards as he increased in Lordships, he augmented his forces, and gathered togither sixe hundred thousand footemen, sixe score thousand horsemen, and aboue two thousand chariots, armed with hookes: His Empire being the greatest and the fairest that euer king had in Asia: bounded towards the East with the red sea, towards the North with the sea Euxinus; on the West with Cypres and Egipt; and on the south with Ethiopia. He conquered first the Countrie of the Medes, and the Hircanians, which yeelded themselues vnto him of their owne free will; then subdued by force the Assyrians, the Arabians, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padocians, the inhabitants of thone, and thother Phrygia; the Lydians, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, Phenicians, and Babylonians: He ouercame the Bactrians, Indians, and Cilicians: Moreouer also the Saques, Paphlagonians, Magadides, and many other Nations. Likewise he made himselfe Lord of the Greeks dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in Asia; and passing the sea, he vanquished the Cyprians, and Egiptians. He besieged and tooke Babylon, which, it was incredible that it might either be built by mans workmanship, or distroyed by humane power: And neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse, he assailed it as an enemie, spoiled it as vanquishour, and disposed of it as Lord. He brought vnder his obedience so many Nations, which were not of his language, nor vnderstood not one an other: and stretched his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion ouer so many Regions, by the feare of his name: In such sort, that he astonied all the world, and none durst resist him. This notwithstanding, he made himselfe so much beloued, that they desired neuer to haue any other Lord; and they reuerenced him as a father, gouerning so great an Empire, and of such largenes, by a meruailous order which he set downe when he was in peace: Prouiding for his residence, counsail, audiences, his gards, the estate of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:13829:48"/>
his house, the seruice, exercise, and health of his person; the traine and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of his Court; diuision of his prouinces, and gouernments of garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in fortresses, and frontiers; his reuenew, iustice, and souldiery: Showing himselfe religious, venerable, magnificent, liberal, and worthie to be imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in all actions, by the Princes that followed after him. It is said that <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> hauing found the sepulcher of Cyrus vncouered and defaced; caused him to be put to death which had done it: And hauing read the inscription, which was in Persian letters, and words; he willed hit also to be written in Greeke vnderneath; and the substance of the inscription being this: <hi>O Man whatsoeuer thou art, and whence soeuer thou comest, (for I am assured that thou wilt come,) I am Cyrus, he which conquered the Empire for the Persians, and I pray thee, do not enuie me this little earth, which couereth my poore bodie.</hi> These words moued greatly the hart of Alexander to compassion, when he consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the vnstabilitie of things.</p>
               <p>XENOPHON vnderstanding <hi>Cyrus</hi> to haue bin a Prince so admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in his deedes, and excellent in gouernment of men, he chose him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse in his person the image of a iust and moderate raigne, writing of his institution: which is one of the best bookes that is to be read in Greeke. Plato acknowledging him for a worthy and valiant Prince, said that he failed greatly in bringing vp of his children: for beginning from his youth to make warre, and being busied all his life therein, he neuer thought on the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his house; but left his two sonns, CAMBISES and SMERDES to the Ladies of the Court, and to the Eunuches to bring vp: who brought them vp as children that were borne happie, not suffering any to gainsay them in any sort; and constrayning all to praise whatsoeuer they did or said. As <hi>Cyrus</hi> then was a Maister of a great multitude of men and beasts, and of many other things, he did not consider that they to whom he was to leaue so many good things, were not brought vp in the auncient Persian discipline, but in the corrupt discipline of the Medes: which was the cause of making them such, as commonly they are, which are brought vp with so much liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Succeeding their father then after his decease, first thone slew the other, not being able to endure an equal, and then like a mad man through dronken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and ignorance he lost his estate, by reason of the contempt which men had of his follie.</p>
               <p>Then DARIVS the first of that name, came to the Empire, who was no kings sonne, nor brought vp in Courtly delights: who gouerned himself by the Lawes, bringing in a common equalitie, and making friendship amongst them all, whom he won with good deedes: So being beloued of his subiects, he conquered no fewer Countries then Cyrus had left him; ordayning tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough out all the Countries, landes, and Lordships, vnder his obedience, twentie gouernments, called in the Persian language Satrapies; and taxing the annuall tributes, which euery of them ought to pay in siluer, after the waight of the Babylonian talent; or in gold, according to the Euboick: for du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the raigne of Cyrus, and his sonne Cambyses, there was no tribute impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
<pb facs="tcp:13829:49"/>
but the Countries brought certaine presents, and gaue certaine gratuites and giftes to the king: by reason of which imposition, the Persians said, that DARIVS was a Merchant, CAMBISES a Lord, and CYRVS a father: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that Darius was too good a husband, &amp; drew profit out of euery thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cambises proude and cruel; but Cyrus soft, kind, gentle, and gratious: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing procured all good things vnto the Persians.</p>
               <p>The first Satrapie comprehended the Iouians, the Magnetians which are in Asia, the Eolians, Car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ans, Lycians, Melyans, and Pamphylians: all which made but a tribute of fortie talents of siluer. The second was of the Mysians, Lydians, Alysonians, Cabalians, and Higennians, which paied fiftie talents of siluer. The third of the Hellespontins, Phrygians, Paphlagonians, Marian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines, and Syrians, taxed at CCClx. talents. The fourth of the Cilicians, which were bound to furnish euery yeare CCClx. white horses: which was for euery day in the yeare a seueral horse: paying moreouer fiue hundred ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, wherof a hundred and fortie were appointed for the finding of the said horses; and the other three hundred &amp; three score went into the kings cofers. The fifth began at the Citie of Possidea, situated in the mountains of Cilicia, and Syria, and stretched out vnto Egipt, except Arabia which was exempted: This parcel of land wherin were comprehended Phenicia, Palestina, and the Isle of Cypres, yeelded CCCL. talents. The sixth consisted in all Egipt, and the bordering Africans, with Cyrene, and Barce, which contributed with them: so that the annual reuenew was of seuen hundred Talents; besides the fishing of the poole Meris; and without reckoning of the Wheat which was prouided for six score thousand Persians, and their auxiliaries keeping garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son within the white wals of Memphis. The seuenth was of the Sattagidians, Gaudarians, Dadiques, &amp; Aparites, which was Clxx. tale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. The eight contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the towne of Sourses; and an other portion of the Cysses, yeelding CCC. The ninth consisted in the Citie of Babylon, and the rest of Assyria, finding a thousand talents of siluer, &amp; fiue hundred gelded boies. Of the tenth ordained for Ecbatane, &amp; the rest of Media, with the xj. consisting of the Paricanians &amp; Orthocorimbantes, were receiued CCCCL. talents. The twelfth reached from the Bactrians to the Egles, and was charged with CCClx. talents, The thirteenth began at Pactica with the Armenians, and other bordering lands; and was bounded with the greater sea, being taxed at CCCC. talents. The fourteenth consisted in the Sagarties, Sarangres, Thamanees, Thiries, Meces, and in the people of the Islands of the red sea: the tribute amounting vnto six hundred talents. In the fifteenth were the Saces and Caspians, which yeelded CCL. In the sixteenth the Parthians, Chorasmians, Sogdians, &amp; Arians: taxed at CCC. In the seuenteenth the Paricanians, &amp; the Ethiopians of Asia CCCC. In the eighteenth the Manineans, Sarpites, &amp; Atlarodians CC. In the xix. the Mosches, Tibarenes, Macrosians, Mosinicians, &amp; Mardians CCC. In the xx. were the Indians; which because they were a verie great multitude, paied more tribute then al the other nations: namely, CCClx. talents of gold. Al these sums which were paid in the Babilonian talent of siluer, being referred to the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:13829:49"/>
Euboick talent, came to nine thousand, fiue hundred, and fortie talents: And the gold of the myne being multiplied by thirteene; to fower thousand, six hundred, and fower score Euboick talents: and was leuied on Asia, and some part of Africk. Then he raised an other tribute on the Isles, and Nations of Europe; hauing stretched out his dominion as far as Thessalie. Persia was freed from all payments; and the Ethiopians sent onely certaine presents: as from three yeares to three, a bushell of gold from the myne, two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fagots of Ebony, fiue hundred blacke boies, and xxij. Elephants, the greatest that could be found. The Cholchois and Caucasians, from fiue yeares to fiue, one hundred young boies, and as manie girles. The Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, euery yeare a present of incense, weighing a thousand talents. The meanes which he vsed to keepe his Treasures, was thus: He caused the gold and siluer to be melted, and cast into earthen barrels; then when the vessell was full, he made it be remoued vp and downe with his Court: and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer he wanted money, he broke, or cut out therof as much as he would. Touching his husbandrie, and care for the intertayning of such power, and riches: first this king was most carefull of Armes, ordayning himselfe in each gouernment, both the victuals, and paies, which were to be distributed to his souldiers, aswell strangers, as his natural subiects, thoroughout his garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: and seeing the musters in person. Where such as were found to haue fulfilled the appointed number of their men; and had best mounted, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished them with armes, were aduanced in honours, and inriched with great gifts: On the contrarie, he chastised such as failed, or were giuen to picory; putting others in their charges: Moreouer, he visited himselfe (as much as he might) the Countries vnder his obedience, endeuouring to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand their estate, and those which he could not see, he caused to be visited by some trustie persons, sent for that purpose. Where he found the Countries well peopled, and the lands diligently husbanded, full of corne, trees, and fruits; he rewarded the Princes, or Gouernors, with great gifts, and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented their charges: But those whose countries were found desert, or euill inhabited, by reason of their rudenes, insolencie, or negligence; he puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed or discharged them: being no lesse carefull to haue his Countries, well ordered by the inhabitants, then to haue them kept in safetie by the garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; and caring no lesse for his reuenewes then his armes; and proposing as great a reward to the diligent labourers, as to the valiant warriours.</p>
               <p>We read, that then when the king of Persia was in his greatest glorie, and reputation, that his Maiestie was highly exalted, and magnificently ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with august and venerable aucthoritie; that his royall seat being esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished at SVSA or ECBATANA, he retyred himselfe out of the sight of men into his pallace, being verie faire and richly decked, with gold, sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, yuorie, and other exquisite things: In the which were many galleries and halls, one within an other, many dores compassed betweene them, and separated by spaces, and the commings to them shut and closed with gates of brasse: That there were many Princes and Lords appointed in their seuerall

Herodotus showeth by iourneis and lodginges, that from Sardes in Lydia, to Susa in Mennonia, which was the Kinges seat, it was three Monethes iourney. It is written also in the booke of <hi>Hester,</hi> that ASSVERVS king of Persia raigned, euen from the Indies vnto Ethiopia, ouer an hundred twentie and seauen prouinces, writing to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie prouince according to the Stile thereof, and to euerie people in their owne language. In the meane time the king termed by them, their Lord and God, saw and vnderstood all things, by meanes of postes ordayned in all the Countries vnder his obedience; and spies dispersed here, and there, and secret Intellegencers: so that being so many Officers, they did euery one in his charge indeuour himselfe in such sort, that their Lord knew incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently whatsoeuer new thing hapned, euen from the frontiers of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment to the place of his residence: which was in the midst of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, dwelling the winter in Babylon, because the aire there is verie mild and temperate; the three monethes of the Spring-time, in the Towne of Susa; and the two monethes of great heat in the Citie of Ecbatana: In such sort, that by this changing of Countries, what season of the yeare so euer it were, he was alwaies in a time like vnto the spring. He was warned euery morning when he waked, to feare God, and to see to those affaires which God hath committed to his charge.</p>
               <p>The intertainment of the Queene was correspondent to this greatnes, and magnificence: for many prouinces were allotted her for the furnishing thereof, which were called diuersly, according to the vse whereunto they were appointed: As one was the Queenes girdle; an other her vaile: and so likewise the rest, according to those ornaments which they furnished. As soone as his first sonne, which was to succeede in the Crowne was borne, all his subiectes celebrated this day; and afterwardes euery yeare thorough out Asia, they solemnized the feast of his natiuitie. Then the child was giuen to be nourished to the Eunuches, which held verie ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable places in the Court; and their principall charge amongst others was, to make him faire, and well proporcioned, by composing and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering his partes conueniently. Then when he was come to seuen yeares, hee learned to ride, and began to goe on hunting. At the fourteenth yeare of his age, hee was instructed by Masters called the royall Paeda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues or Tutours, which were fower chosen amongst all the Persians, the chiefest of age and sufficiencie, that is, the most wise, iust, temperate, and valiant: The first taught hym the Magicke of ZOROASTER, consisting in the seruice of the Godds, and kingly manners. The second
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:13829:50"/>
warned him to bee all his life true, and veritable. The third, that hee should not bee supplanted by any cupidity or desire. The fourth, was to make him without feare, to the end he should not be subiect to cowardise and pusillanimitie.</p>
               <p>But howbeit these things were well, and religiously instituted; yet were they ill obserued. For after Darius his sonne XERXES comming to rainge, which had bin brought vp in the same Kingly delicacies as Cambises, hee likewise fell into the like inconueniences. For possessing togither what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer Cyrus and Darius his father had gotten, and seeing himselfe excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding riche and mighty, hee purposed to conquere Greece, and came thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with an inestimable army, hauing by Sea fiue hundred and seuenteen thousand, sixe hundred men; by land a milion and seuen hundred thousand foote, and fourescore thousand horsemen, with twentie thousand Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Africans; vnto whom there ioyned of Europe three hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand; the whole multitude comming to two milions, sixe hundred &amp; seuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d fighting me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: the greatest that euer was in field after those of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus and Semiramis: at the least, of which we haue knowledge by histories. Insomuch that we need not to maruaile, at that which is sayd, that running ryuers were dried vp by the infinite number which dranke of them, and that there were so many sailes that one coulde not see the Sea, by reason of them. But therein the riches of <hi>Xerxes</hi> was more to bee admired, then his conduct to bee commended; because he was alwaies seen to bee the first in flying, and the last in comming to fight: being fearefull in daungers, couragious and stoute in security, and before hee came to the hazard of the warres. Trusting in his forces, as if he had bin Lord ouer nature, hee leueled mountaines with the plaines, filled and raised vp vallies, passed ouer armes of the Sea on bridges which he caused to bee made, and tourned the course of others by newe channels to saile at his pleasure. But by how much more his comming into Greece was terrible; his departure thence, was so much the more dishonourable: For being astonyed by the discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitures of his people, both by Sea and lande, hee went backe into Asia, euen almost alone, in a fisherboate. Which retraite deserueth well to bee considered with admiration, for knowledge of the trueth of mens deeds: to see him hidden in a little Schiffe, whom, but a little before the whole Sea could not suffice; and to see him destitute of seruants, whose armie all Greece coulde scarse intertaine. In this manner Xerxes who had bin the terrour of the worlde began to bee despised of his owne people: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had bin so vnhappy in the expedition of Greece. In so much that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabanus an Hircanian a man of great credite with him, and Captaine of his Guarde slue him, and Darius his eldest sonne after him; hoping to make himselfe King: but setting vpon Artaxerxes the second sonne, and hauing giuen him a stroke with his sworde, ARTAXERXES feeling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe wounded, but not to death, est soones tooke his sword in hand for his defence, and stroke Artabanus such a blowe that he fell dead to the ground.
<pb facs="tcp:13829:51"/>
So ARTAXERXES being almost miraculously saued, and hauing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so therewith auenged the death of his father succeeded him in the kingdom, and Empire of Persia, where there hath not bin since any king that hath bin great in deed as Plato sayth: nor of any reckoning or renowne. For taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the people to much of their liberty: &amp; introducing a more absolute authority of ruling ouer them, then was conuenient, they lost the amitie and communion of the state. Which things being lost, the Princes looked no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the profit of the subiects, or of the people: but for the conseruation of their authoritie, whatsoeuer little profit was offered them, they razed the townes, and consumed with fire the nations that were their friends: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting spitefully, and without mercy; they were hated in like maner. And when it was needful that their people should fight for them, they fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d them not of accord, to hazard them selues willingly, and to fight: but ruling ouer almost innumerable men, they made them vnfit for war; and as hauing need of men, they hyred others; thinking to preserue themselues, and their state by mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary and straunge Souldiors: who likewise forgat themselues, shewing by their deeds that they preferred riches before vertue. The tyrannies which they vsed towards their subiects for their pretended conseruation are recited by Aristotle in his Politicks, but not approued: as to abase and pull downe the highest, and to take away the most couragious, not to permit their ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, assemblies, disciplines, nor any such thing: but to take heed to whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is wont to ingender these two; highnes of minde, and confidence: to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid them Schooles, and all other companies and meetinges; and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide in any case that they came not acquainted one with another: conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that knowledge and acquaintance maketh men to haue more affyance one in another. That all the archers of the Guard being straungers, should shew themselues in the streets, and walke before the doores of houses; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that which the subiectes imagined or practised, should not be kept secret: and they would come to haue lesse courage by being continually kept vnder. Moreouer to endeuour to discouer what they said and did, and to haue spies, listeners, and referendaries, dispersed thorough out the Countries, and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer there were any assemblies: for they become lesse hardy by fearing such maner of people, and if they should waxe hardy, they be yet lesse secret. Also that they should accuse and slander one an other, and friends fall to debate with friends, the common people with the Nobles, and the riche amongst themselues. And to impouerish the subiects, serueth that they be not constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to keepe a guard; and that being euery day busied, they may haue no leasure to conspire; and that being vrged with some war they may alwaies haue need of their king; as their head and Chiefetaine. Not to suffer about him graue persons, and free of speech; because that such diminish the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, and authority of the Lord: which would only seeme to be such a one himselfe. All which meanes, and such other like, being drawen out of the gouernment of the Persians; are tyrannicall, and most pernitious; gathered by Aristotle, not to the end to teach them vnto others; but rather to beware of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:13829:51"/>
them by knowing the misery of tyrants which are constrained to fly to such euils, thereby to assure their parsons, and estates: which when they thinke by these meanes to bee surest and safest, are then soonest ouerthrowen at vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares thorough the hate which their tyrannies haue engendred.</p>
               <p>By which rough and hard vsage the Persians being degenerated, suffred them selues to bee ouercome in many partes of Asia, bordering on the Sea; and hauing passed into Europe, they were beaten backe; some of them peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing miserably, and others flying shamefully; as they were worthy, and had wel deserued. For it is impossible (saith Isocrates in his Panegyrick speaking of them) to finde in people so brought vp, and gouerned, any vertue or prowes to triumphe ouer their enemies. How should there be amongst such maners, either valiant Captaine, or good Souldiour; the greatest part of them being but a confused multitude, and not accustomed to perills; being too soft for warre, and fitter to make slaues and drudges then our owne seruants? The most honourable amongest them neuer liued equally, familiarly, or ciuilly, but continue all their life to doe outrage vnto some and seruice vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others; as people of depraued natures. By their aboundance of riches, they decke their bodies magnificently, hauing their mindes base and vile, by their Monarchie: And being resident in Court, they learne to humble them selues, and to haue a cowardly hart, worshipping a mortall man, and calling him God; and making lesse account of Gods then of men. Those also which inhabite towardes the Sea who are called Satrapes, doe not dishonour the Persian discipline, but perseuer in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, behauing them selues disloyally towardes their friendes, and cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly towardes their enemies; and humbling themselues on one side, and swelling on the other, they dispise their allies; and honour their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries.</p>
               <p>XENOPHON comparing the raigne of Cyrus, and of his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours, and rendring a reason of the chaunge of manners which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in that nation; sayth that before time; not onely the king, but all pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate men also were wont to keepe faithfully, and constantly their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, made either by oath, or by touching of handes, yea euen to those which had done some offence worthy of death: but this faithfulnesse was afterward lost. For before, if any one had hazarded himselfe in perils for the King, had subdued some nation, taken a Towne, or done any vertuous exployte, the King raised him vnto honour: but sithence; traitours, and such as to creepe into fauour kept neither promise nor faith; were most reckoned of in Court. After whose example all the inhabitants of Asia, haue run into all iniustice, and impiety. Also afterward they became more licentious in ill doing, and more couetous, and so consequently more wicked. For they raunsomed and constrayned to pay money, not only such as were culpable of crimes, and guilty of great misdeeds; but also those which had not done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny iniust or dishonest act: wherhence it came to passe that not onely male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factours, but al those of the richer sort were in continuall feare, and would
<pb facs="tcp:13829:52"/>
not yeeld themselues to the most mighty; and durst not approach or trust to the king; neither be of his bandes of ordinance; neither go to warre vnder him. By meanes whereof it was more then lawfull for those which made warre on them, to forrage and spoile their Countrey without fight; and to the people to reuolt without feare of punishment: as well for their impiety toward the Gods; as for their iniustice towardes men. Moreouer they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more faint of courage, and vntoward of mind and disposition, not vsing any discipline either of body or mind: hauing lost and left off that maner of exercising themselues which was commaunded them; and all rules of good life. For before there was a law amongst them, that they should not spit nor blowe their noses; which was not ordained to make them retaine the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours within their bodies; but to thend that by exercise all those humours should be consumed, and they haue their bodies stronger, and liuelier: now the custome not to spit, nor blow their noses, remained still; but to take paines at any labour or exercise, there was no such matter. They had also an other Law to eate but once a day, to thend to haue the rest of the time free to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe on their busines; and it is true that they did eate but once a day; but they began it early in the morning, and so continued eating and drinking til night when they go to bed. Before, they dranke no wine, and abhorred all dronkennes; but sithence, they gaue themselues to wine; and thought it no shame to be dronke. They were wont to go so oft on hunting, that it suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to keepe them in breath, and their horses also: but they left off that, as they did other good things. Moreouer the order for their children to frequent the Court remained; but the discipline of ryding horses, and vaulting was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither lost. And whereas in times past the children learned iustice, by seeing causes iudged according to right and reason; that was altogither abolished: because that none ouercame in iudgement, but those which gaue most mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. They vsed before in their liuing, the discipline, and continence of the the Persians; and did onely weare the magnificent habit of the Medes: but they afterwards suffered the Persian constancy to be extinguished; and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued curiously the delicacy of the Medes. It suffised them not to haue their beds made very soft; but their feet also trode vpon tapistry: lest their going on the pauement should make any noise: The seruice of the Table, and things inuented for magnificence, were augmented from day to day with new licou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rousnes, and delicacies. In the winter it was not enough for them to haue their head, body, and feete couered; but they vsed to weare double gloues: In Summer the shadowes of the trees could not content them, but they had men about them, which inuented other kindes of shades to coole them, after a strange fashion. Their auncient custome was to be alwaies on horseback, and neuer on foote; to thend to make them good men at armes: but now they had more clothes and couerings on their horses, then on their beds; and cared not so much for matter of armes and horsemanship, as to be sat at their ease. How should they not then become more effeminate, and faint in matters of war, then they were before? For then it was the custome of the Countrey,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:13829:52"/>
for those which held lands to furnish men at armes, and to send them forth to seruice; likewise to giue good pay to garrisons, whensoeuer there was occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for defence of their countrey: but since that time porters, cookes, bakers, cupbearers, tasters, waiters on the bathes, seruants of the table, ryders, hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers, such as carry and recarry meate, groomes of the Chamber for their downlying and their vprysing, barbers, and trimmers, persumers, and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and others of such like occupations, were they which the rich men sent in steed of men of armes to the warre, to thend that they should bring them their pay. Euen those which seemed the best, shewed themselues cowards, knowing the euill recompence which they were to looke for. And finding in themselues their owne cowardise, they went about no expedition with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Greeks, whether it were to make warre in their Countrey, or that the Greekes assailed them; thinking that they could not ouercome without their helpe: and that which is more, they holpe themselues, with the Greeks them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, to make warre against the Greekes.</p>
               <p>They were indeed a great multitude, but vnprofitable in fight; as it was clerely knowen by the valiancy and hardines of the Macedonian ALEX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ANDER, who with xl. or l. thousand fighting men at the most, ouercame three times DARIVS the last King of the Persians, who led fower or fiue hundred thousand, and brought him into such extremity, that thinking to reunite himselfe in the third ouerthrow, he was traiterously taken by BES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS gouernour of Bactria, which had the principall charge vnder him, who put him in a golden cage, and cast him on a chariot, meaning to carry him to Bactria; then seeing that Alexander approached, caused him to bee killed with darts and Iauelins; and left him dead in the midst of the way. Such was the end of a king so mighty in people, in possessions and reuenews; who called him selfe Lord of all the world from the East vnto the West: hauing raigned onely sixe yeres in all delicacies, exceeding the common magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of Princes. Which luxurious maner of liuing was cause of his vtter ouerthrow: as humane things being variable haue their fatall inclination, so ordained by the diuine prouidence to fall then, when they are mounted high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est; and that the Lords thinke themselues to be most assured, sleeping there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in carelesnes and ouerweening conceits. For he suffered himselfe to slide so farre into deliciousnes, and superfluous riches, that he slept alwaies in a chamber betweene two great chambers, most richly furnished: in such sort that the Kings bed being sumptuously spred in his chamber, and couered with a vine of gold, in manner of a grate or lettis, enriched with precious stones gathered togither in manner of hanging clusters of grapes; the beds head was placed towards the wal of one of the great chambers, in which ther was fiue thousand talents of gold; and this great roome was called the kings beds head: whereunto right opposite was the wall of the other great cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, against his beds foote, in the which there was alwaies three thousand ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents of siluer; and was called the kings beds foote: which summes are estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med after our maner to be worth thirty millions of Crownes. Going to war
<pb facs="tcp:13829:53"/>
he caried with him in his host, for his pastime, and delight cccxxxix. women, as Concubines, singers, dauncers, and such as were skilfull in all kinde of Musicke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> xlvj. workmen to set flowers in order, and to make garlands, nose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaies, chapelets, and other sweete smelling things; cclxxvij. cookes, xxix. pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, making euery day vessels of earth to serue the kitchin; xiij. bakers of tarts and such other licorous, and delicate bakemeates: Cellerers, cupbearers, bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and minglers of wines, makers of spiced cupps, and of all artificiall ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours, and drinkes; xvij. of thone sort, and lxx. of the other. Perfumers and makers of sweete smelling sauours, and odours, both wet and dry; xl. If then the king of Persia vsed so much delicacy being in warr, and nourished him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with so many delights in the field; what did he whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he remained in peace at Persepoli, or in Babylon a city abounding in all superfluities, and in all vices that proceed of great plenty? Yet notwithstanding in the flower of his fortune, he being dronken with prosperity and aboundance of goods, was spoyled of his riches, which had bin heaped togither by many kings his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessours; losing his life, and his kingdome; which was clymed to the top of the worldy power and felicity: where ariseth the spring of pride, arrogancy, ouerweening, and extreme insolency. And there is the slippery path where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on standeth the enuy of fortune, and where soueraigne felicity falleth head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into great calamity.</p>
               <p>By this so magnificent victory ouer him, ALEXANDER brought vnder his obedience almost al the countries of the East: and transported the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy out of Asia into Europe. So the Macedonians tooke away the Empire of the East from the Persians; and the Parthians from the Macedonians by the conduct of Arsaces a Captaine of an vncertaine birth, but of a most approued vertue; and no lesse memorable amongst them, then Cyrus among the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians: and Alexander among the Macedonians: by whose name they called the succeeding Kings, because of the reuerence which they bare vnto him. They became so mighty that for a time they ruled ouer all Asia, possessing not onely the vnmeasurable plaines, but also the abrupt dounfals of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines; and placing the bounds of their Empire, where either the heate or the cold staied them with snowes, or immoderate, and burning heates. They pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed eighteene kingdomes, deuiding in this maner their prouinces, as hauing respect to the two Seas, that is the red Sea towards the South, and the Caspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an toward the North: where of eleuen which were called the superiour or higher, began at the confines of Armenia, and at the bankes of the Caspian Sea, extending euen to the Scythians: Thother seauen were termed the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour or lower. They seemed to diuide the world with the Romaines, thone ruling in the East; and thother the West. Their dominion from ARSA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CES to ARTABANVS, endured cccc. yeres, which was brought backe againe into Persia by ARTAXERXES, and after cccxviij. yeres, was taken againe from the Persians by the Arabians or Sarazens.

Their king is called SOPHI, which is as much to say as wise, and the Interpreter of God: because that ISMAEL, the first that was so named, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the colour of expositions, &amp; new ceremonies brought in by him into the religion of Mahomet, got no longe time since, a great Empire in the East, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing driuen away the race of Vsun-Cassanus king of Persia, to whom he was allied by his mothers side; and made many Princes, and Lords of the East his vassals or tributaries. The chiefe prouinces vnder his obedience were Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia the great, Persia, Media, &amp; Assyria: with iiij. capital or head Cities, <hi>Tauris<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

There are gentlemen amongst them after the maner of Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, France, &amp; Spaine, which vse barded horses in the wars: vnto which they go welarmed, bearing great lances and good cymeters; being also very good ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers. The Sophi is opposite on the one side to the Ottoman, &amp; to the Zaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thain on thother. Thus haue the kingdoms of Asia &amp; of the East varied.</p>
               <p>But before we go out of this quarter, we must speak of the MAGES, which were far different from other natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in their religion, &amp; wisdom. They had no temples, Images, nor altars; neither was it permitted by their law to make any; esteeming them fools which had them; &amp; accounting it impiety to inclose the Gods within wals, which ought to haue al open &amp; free; &amp; whose temple and house was the whol world. For this cause they perswaded Xerxes warring in Greece to burne al the Temples, which he should find there. And when they would sacrifice, they went vp into high mountaines; where it was not lawful for him that sacrificed to pray onely for himselfe; but hee must also pray for the prosperity of the king, and generally of all the Persians: being himselfe by this means comprised in the praier. Euery one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when they would sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, brought his offering into a place that was not contaminated; then hauing his attire on his head made for the most part of mirtle, he called on that God to whom he sacrificed. They would neither, pisse, spit, nor void their noses in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the riuers, but reuerenced them aboue all things. They suffered their dead bodies to be bitten, &amp; praied on by doggs, and birds, before they would bury them; others anointed them ouer with waxe, &amp; then put them into the earth. They and the Egyptians did not burne them, because the Persians said it was not fit that a God should feed on a dead man; &amp; the Egyptians thought the fire to be a liuing creature, eating, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>suming whatsoeuer he seased on; &amp; dying with his meat whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was ful: &amp; in their Law it was not permitted to cast the dead bodies to birds and beasts to deuoure them, or to any liuing Creatures: and therefore they embalmed them with salt, that they should not be eaten of wormes. The Egyptians would neuer kill any thing that had life: The Mages
<pb facs="tcp:13829:54"/>
killed with their handes euery liuing creature, sauing man: whom also the DRVIDES of Gaule did not spare to kill, and sacrifice; diuining by south<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayings as the MAGES, whom they resembled in many thinges: shewing themselues so cerimonious in obseruing of Magick, that they seemed to haue taught it to the Persians; and not to haue learned it of them, as Pliny sayth. These Mages gaue out that the Gods appeared vnto them, and foretold them of things to come; affirming that the aire was full of spirits, which did sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly insinuate themselues into mens eyes: that there were two princes; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one good God which they called Herosmades: and the other euill whom they termed Arinan. They clothed themselues with white garments, liued of herbes, cheese, and course bread, slept on the ground, caried canes or reades, in steed of staues: They assembled in a holy place to communicate, and talke togither. Their authority was so great that Cambises when he went out of Persia left the gouernment of his house to one of them, who in the absence of the king conspired with a brother of his against him, and went about to make himselfe king. Their Magicke consisted wholy in the religion and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the Gods; To whom they offered praiers, vowes and sacrifices, as if they onely were exalted; beleeuing the resurrection of men, and that they should be immortall: Aristotle witnesseth that they were auncienter then the PROPHETS of Egypt; &amp; Clearehus affirmeth that the BRACHMANES, or GYMNOSOPHISTS of India came from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. ZOROASTER with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt was the first inuentor, whom somethinke by the etimologie of his name, to haue bin an obseruer of the starres; and to haue vnderstood natural things. Plato in his first Alcibiades, saith that the Magick of ZOROASTER is a knowledge of diuine mysteries, which was wont to bee taught vnto the children of the kings of Persia; to thend they might learne by example of the whole worlds common wealth, to gouerne their owne. And in his Charmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, he sayth that the Magick of ZAMOLSIS was the physick of the minde causing it to vse temperance; as the other is cause of bodily health. Pitha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras, Empedocles, Democritus, and the same Plato, sayled and went far to learne it; and hauing learned it, did celebrate it at their retourne, and kept it secret: and many other vertuous amongest the auncients haue trauailed carefully therein; getting great authority, and reputation thereby. For ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing by it, the meruailes hidden in the secretes of the world, in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some of Nature, and mysteries of God, they haue discouered the concords of the world, and agreement of the heauen with the earth; accommodating the superiour thinges to the inferiour, after they had once knowen their vertues howe they agree in doing and suffering; which the Greekes call <hi>Sympathies,</hi> and <hi>Antipathies:</hi> which hath moued Plotinus to call such MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GES making profession of naturall MAGICKE, the ministers of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It is at this day much vsed in CHINA and CATHAY which are Countries inhabited by most ingenious and industrious people; where they are not permitted to come to Offices, and Honours in the Common wealth without being learned, namely in this MAGICKE: which
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:13829:54"/>
signifieth to speak simply according to the auncient Persian language, perfect, and soueraigne wisedome, and MAGVS an expounder, and obseruer of the diuinity. Sithence that, men haue abusiuely transferred this name to inchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who do wickedly abuse the simple; making them beleeue that they know the secret and future things, by strange words, by signes, and characters, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelish deceits and impostures, and other superstitious obseruations of Necro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantie, Geomantie, Hydromantie, Aeromantie, Pyromantie, &amp; such other of long time reproued both by diuine, and humane lawes. Wherhence may be vnderstood that there are two sorts of MAGICK, thone natural, &amp; thother superstitious. The natural in contemplating the vertues of celestial, and terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall things, &amp; considering the conuenances &amp; contrarieties, discouereth the powers which are hidden in nature; &amp; mingling thone with thother in due proportion, &amp; vnder certain constellation, and applying the actiue to the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue, draweth them one to another by the similitude of nature. So the elements do draw thone the other; so the loadstone draweth the yron to it; amber the chaffe; and brimstone fire; the sunne many flowers, &amp; leaues; the Moone wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; &amp; Mars the winds; many herbes drawe vnto them many liuing creatures, and haue meruailous secret properties, by the which this Magicke naturally worketh great miracles. The other superstitious Magick is by inuocation of euil spirits; which is a manifest Idolatry; and hath alwaies bin forbidden by wel ordered common weales. Such were the MAGICIANS of PHARAO which counterfeited diuelishly whatsoeuer MOSES &amp; ARON diuinely had wrought, til such time as the rod of MOSES turned into a serpent did eate vp theirs which they had tourned also into serpents. Such was SIMON MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GVS, and such the Pythonisse was that called vp the soule of Samuel the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, such also was Circe, &amp; such a one was Medea. Plutarch writeth that the spirit of Antony being bound by magicall verses, and loue drenches; that his liberty being lost he was fixed in the face of Cleopatra. The Euthydemus of Plato compareth Oratorie, and Magicke or Enchauntery togither, and sayth that as Oratory is a delighting and appeasing of the Iudges, and assemblies of men, so that Enchanting is an asswaging of vipers, spiders, scorpions, &amp; other venimous, and cruel beastes; as also of diseases. The vanity of this superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Magick appeared especially in the Emperour Nero, who gaue him selfe to it as much as euer any man did, hauing neither want of goods, of power, nor of vnderstanding: and desiring nothing more then to command the Gods, and the dead. Notwithstanding after he had called vnto him, Tyridates king of Armenia, who excelled in Magick, to learne it of him; and had employed long time, great labour &amp; infinite treasure theron (not omitting also to do such abhominable superstition as was presciibed him) yet in the end he found all false which had bin told him, and so gaue it ouer. This notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding it hath bin dispersed throughout the world which is so diuers in other things; vnder the colour of faire, but yet vaine and friuolous promises, associating it self with religion, Phisick, and Mathematicks; which three haue a meruailous power ouer the vnderstandings of men: And thus being fortified with a threefolde
<pb facs="tcp:13829:55"/>
vertue, it could neuer yet be altogither exterminated, &amp; rooted out; but there remaine here and there stil some relicks, and remainders thereof: but in secret notwithstanding, for feare of the punishment which is appointed for it; and the shame which commeth vnto those that abuse themselues therein.</p>

               <p>THE Monarchies of the Egyptians, Assyrians, Medians, Persians, &amp; Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, agree in this, that they haue bin established chiefely in the fertile and temperate countries of Asia; where the men are gentle and tractable, or naturally seruile; as Hyppocrates and Aristotle affirme. For the inhabitants, which are remoued from al temperature, wil not easily be brought vnder sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, and cannot well be gouerned; not enduring any long or durable go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, except it be altogither tyrannical: as is that of the MOSCOVITE in the north; and of the ABYSSINE in Ethiopia; where the great KNES

commaundeth thone, and PRESBITER IOHN the other most rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronsly; to thend to keepe their subiects in obedience: who are all generally of opinion, that whatsoeuer their Princes do, they do it by the vnchangeable wil of God.</p>
               <p>The circuite, and compas of their Monarchies were very great; SESOS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRIS the Egyptian conquered all Arabia, and a great part of Lybia; Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia, with all the Isles of that countrey; al the sea coasts euen to the Indies; pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the riuer Ganges running hither and thither, euen to the great Ocean, and ouer came all the nations of the Scythians, euen to the riuer Tanais: &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into Europe, went through the countrey of Thrace; where he made an end of his enterprise, &amp; retorned into Egypt. NINVS brought vnder his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience all the nations, which inhabite on the sea-coast toward the East, and their neighbors, as the Egyptians, Phenicians, those of the inner Syria, Cilicia, Pamphilia, Lycia, Caria, Phrygia, Mysia, Troada, and the other Phrygia which is on Hellespont, the countrey of Propontida, Bythinia, Cappadocia, and other barbarous nations which inhabite on the greater sea, euen to the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Tanais: He added more ouer to his estate the Cadusians, Tapyres, Hirca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, Dranges, Deruices, Caramanians, Coronians, Rombes, Vuocarnians, the Parthians, Persians, Susians, Caspians, and Bactrians. SEMIRAMIS his wife the greatest part of Lybia, and Ethiopia. The limits of the Empire of CYRVS, were on the East-side the red sea; on the North the sea Euxinus; towards the west Cyprus &amp; Egypt; on the south Ethiopia: CAMBYSES his sonne added Egypt, &amp; Ethiopia. And DARIVS the first of that name subdued no fewer countries then the two former had conquered: &amp; consequently the others which came after, augmented and enriched it from hand to hand; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that kingdome one of the greatest, most mighty, &amp; most renowmed that was euer in the worlde. The PARTHIANS possessed xviij. kingdomes, wherof the xj. which were called the superiour, began at the Confines of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia, and bankes of the Caspian sea, and reached vnto the Sythians: the other seuen inferiour kingdomes, stretched out euen to the red sea, diuiding their Prouinces, as respecting the two seas, the red sea toward the south; &amp; the Caspia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on the north. As the spaciousnes of these Monarchies, was very large, so the reuenew was also great; the riches infinite; and power incredible. SE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SOSTRIS erected two square pillers of hard stone, ech of them thirty sadom high; in which he commaunded to be pourtrayed the greatnes of his Empire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the value of his demeine, and reuenew engrauen: adding thereto the number of the nations which he had ouer come. He gathered an army of sixe hundred thousand foote, foure and twenty thousand horse-men, eight and twenty thousand chariots fit for war: and foure hundred ships on the red sea. The riches, and power of the Assyrian Monarchy, is knowen by the great and magnificent townes that were built by NINVS, and SEMIRAMIS; and by the wonderfull armies which they had: namely NINVS going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Bactrians, with seuenteen hundred thousand foote, two hundred thousand horsemen; ten thousand and sixe hundred armed chariots. SEMI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAMIS
<pb facs="tcp:13829:56"/>
against the Indians with three Millions of foote, fiue hundred thousand horsemen, one hundred thousand chariots, and two thousand ships: vnto which STAVROBATES then King of India, opposed like for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or greater. Moreouer the vnreasonable riches of Assyria, appeared in the end of Sardanapalus, who would haue consumed with himselfe by fire, a thousand Myriades of gold; that is to say, a thousand milions: and a myriade of myriades of siluer, which are a hundred milions: endeuouring to spoile the earth of so great quantity of golde, and siluer; comming to forty Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Crownes in our money: besides the beds, and tables of golde, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious stones, garmentes of purple, and other royall mouables, and stuffe that was there: and besides three thousand talents of Gold, which he had sent before with his children to bee safe kept, to the King of the City of Niniuy.</p>
               <p>Concerning the PERSIAN Monarchy, CYRVS who founded it, had infinite wealth, hauing spoiled all Asia; where he got fiue hundred thousand talents of siluer; which is the greatest summe or quantity of siluer, that was euer found gathered togither at one time: rysing to three hundred millions of crownes, and a sixth part ouer, which are fifty milions. And it is not to be meruailed that he had so much; for he got into his power, the treasure of CRESVS; of DAVID and SALOMON; the auncient riches of As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syria; which were translated into Media; and of many other Countries. As DARIVS the first of that name ordained the tributes, they might come to ten milions of gold euery yere; besides the gifts of great value, which were giuen by the nations subiect vnto him: and without speaking of such as were exempted. The Queene had certaine townes and prouinces assigned her, for her intertainment: one furnished the attire of her head, another this or that ornament: which wealth was alwaies augmented by the Kinges that followed, euen to Darius the last: in so much that in his raigne it was already become intollerable in destiny, and to luxurious; and was therefore the ruine of him and of his estate. For in the conquest which Alexander made, hee founde meruailous great Treasures in diuers Countries, of his kingdome; namely at Susa, and Persepoli (as Quintus Curtius writeth) one hundred and seuenty thousand talents of siluer in masse; sixe thousand in Damasco; an other summe in Babylon; and fifty thousand talents of purple. Strabo writeth that the most common opinion was, that there were found forty thousand talents in Persia, besides that which was elswhere; and that some esteemed the whole at nine-score thousand talentes: which is an incredible summe: and as great as hath euer bin numbred or gathered after that foresaid treasure of CYRVS. For the hundred thousand talents are esteemed at three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score milions of Crownes; and the fourescore thousand remaining woulde come by this estimation to more then forty millions, which would be in al a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a hundred millions. This king vsed to make bankets to such as were of best reckoning in his Court, to the number of fifteen thousand; and for euery supper, he appointed in expence of table, fower hundred talents, valued at
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:13829:56"/>
twelue score thousand Crownes. The bed wheron he slept was sumptuously set forth, and couered with a vine of gold, in maner of a grate or lettice enriched with precious stones, hanging like clusters of grapes: He had at his beds-head in treasure fiue thousand talents of gold; and at his beds-foote al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies three thousand talents of siluer. Such was the dominion, and riches of the Persians; whereunto their power was correspondent: for CYRVS as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled an armie of six hundred thousand fighting men on foote; six thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand on horseback, and about two thousand chariots of warre. DARIVS the first of that name, going to fight against the Scythians, led eight hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men. XERXES came into Greece, hauing by sea fiue hundred and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenteen thousand, six hundred men; by land a Million, seuen hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand foote, and fower score thousand horsemen: with twentie thousand Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans &amp; Arabians, to whom there ioyned of Europe three hundred thousand; the whole multitude comming to aboue two Millions six hundred seuenteen thousand fighting men. Since that time the PARTHIANS obtayning the Empire of the East, and ruling ouer all Asia, between the red sea, and the Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian, came not to so great riches and power, as the PERSIANS (for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test force which I find they euer had, was of Cxx. thousand men on foote, and horseback) notwithstanding they found themselues so strong, that being in three warres assailed by great Romain Captaines, in the vigour and flower of their Empire, amongst all the Nations of the world, they not onely remained equall; but also were sometimes superiours.</p>
               <p>The length of all INDIA from the East vnto the West, is of seuenteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Leagues; and from the North to South of two thousand Leagues. It ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celleth aboue all others in beautie &amp; fertilitie; being diuided into many parts, by the riuers which do water it: Where is found great quantitie of Gold, Siluer, Brasse, precious stones; and all other things concerning riches and delicacies. STAVROBATES raigning there in the time of SEMIRAMIS (who inuaded it) indeuoured to exceede the forces of the ASSYRIANS, opposing as mightie an Armie against her, as she had brought with her; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing three Millions of foote, and fiue hundred thousand horsemen; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayned her to retire, with great losse of her people, and without doing any thing. The ETHIOPIANS beleeued, that by reason of their deuotion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Gods, they were neuer wholy ouercome by any straunger: and therefore remaine alwaies free. At this day PRESBITER IOHN raigneth there farre and wide; hauing fortie kings tributarie: and commaunding ouer infinite people of diuers colours; of whom shalbe spoken hereafter in due place. The SCYTHIANS faine, that in old time in their Countrey there was borne of the earth a virgin, which was a woman from the nauel vpward, and the rest a snake; who begate a sonne called SCYTHA, which named the SCYTHIANS after his owne name, hauing made himselfe the most tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant Prince of all that euer were before him: And that amongst the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors of this king, there were two brothers of great vertue, who did many thinges worthie of praise; whose lyne being long time greatly increased,
<pb facs="tcp:13829:57"/>
by vertuous acts, and militarie aduentures, subdued the Countries beyond the riuer Tanais, euen vnto Thrace. And turning afterward their armies on the other side, came as farre as the Nile of Egipt, making themselues Lords of all the people between them: &amp; stretching out their dominion from the great Ocean, which is toward the sunne rising; euen to the Caspian sea, and to the poole Meotis. Of these people thus fortified and increased, many Nations haue discended, and amongst the rest the Sares, Massagetes, Assyrians, Medes, and Parthians: Then the Lordship of the SCYTHIANS, fayling through length of time, that the women called AMAZONS began to raigne there: whose power and vertue was so great, that they subdued not onely the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons neere vnto them, but also a great part of Europe, and of Asia.</p>
               <p>The greatest, fairest, and most magnificent Cities of the world, were NINIVIE, and BABYLON in Assyria: THEBES, and MEMPHIS; and afterwardes ALEXANDRIA in Egipt. But the Medians transferring to them selues the Empire of the Assyrians, destroied and razed the Citie of Niniuie; carying to ECBATANA a citie of Media, all the gold and siluer, and other ornaments which they found there. In like sort the Persians, taking the Empire from the Medes, caried away all the riches which they found in Babylon: and the castels, palaces, and other ornaments and singularities were either distroied by them, or consumed by succession of time. The same Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians in the time that Cambyses conquered Egipt, did not onely transport the ornaments of the singularities of Egipt into Asia, but also their artisans, by whose industrie they built their magnificent palaces, both in PERSEPOLI, and in SVSA. And the Macedonians vnder Alexander, burned Persepoli to the ground, and tooke away all the treasures, precious, moueables, &amp; other ornaments of Persia.</p>
               <p>But as these great Lordships were begun, and maintained by vertuous Princes, accompanied with men at armes on horseback, and on foote; hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto all labours, accustomed to watch, to endure hunger and thirst pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, to drink water, being skilfull and exercised in armes: so ended they vnder loose and voluptuous Lords; hauing their subiects depraued and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by deliciousnes, proceeding of too much riches. NINVS interpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Conquest of Asia, exercised the strongest and lustiest young men of his kingdom, long before vnto armes, to the perils and dangers of warre, and to endure paciently all paines and trauailes. The father of SESOSTRIS, being aduertised by reuelation, that the sonne which should be borne vnto him, should be King of the whole world, gathered together out of all Egipt, all the children that were borne the same day that he was; and caused them all to be taught and brought vp in the same discipline, and exercises; accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming them to paine, to make them endure it continually; and to abstain from eating and drinking; and to make them by such bringing vp, both stronger of bodie, and hardier of courage then the rest: of whom as being from their youth giuen to vertuous things, he was in all his conquests serued valiantly, with fidelitie and affection. CYRVS being by nature noble and valiant, was
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:13829:57"/>
brought vp after the auncient Persian maner, with the young Persian gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (called <hi>Omotimes,</hi> because they were all equall in honours) in all sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and laborous exercises: afterwards when he went to warre, making choise of them to accompanie him, they were a great helpe vnto his greatnes. ARSACES being accustomed to liue on pray in the mountaines and forests, with people of like bringing vp; established the kingdom of the Parthians.</p>
               <p>Such were the Authors or promotours of these Monarchies, alike in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and education: euen as they also in whose raignes they ended, resembled one another in pleasure and pusilanimitie, and died wretchedly. SARDA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAPALVS burning himselfe; with all his treasures. ASTYAGES van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished and taken in warre; afterward bound with chaines of gold. DA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RYVS the last, hauing lost three great battailes; and seen prisoners, his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, his wife, and two daughters; as he thought to gather together his forces, taken prisoner by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in whom he had most confidence, being in pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie; then miserably slaine with iauelins, and left dead in the way.</p>
               <p>As then these later Princes ran by their vices into most piteous fortunes, and little differing thone from thother: so the other by their vertues got great praises. NINVS was the first that established the greatnes of that domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was gotten by continuall possession; where the former sought not the Empire for themselues, but for the glorie of their people: and being content with the victorie, let alone the Lordship and Seignorie. CYRVS is thought alone amongst all the Lords that haue sodainly growen great, to haue knowen how to obserue modestie in his prosperities; and to bridle his absolute power and aucthoritie with equitie, and clemencie. SESOS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRIS was so braue and haughtie, that whensoeuer he went to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or any whether in publike, he caused his chariot to be drawen by fower tributarie kings, or other great Lords, in steed of horses: shewing thereby that none of the other Kings or Captaines was to be compared to him in vertue and prowesse. Also the goings of CYRVS out of his pallace, which haue since bin imitated by the kings his successors, were most mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent: and seruing much to the honour of a Prince, and his gouernment. SEMIRAMIS as soone as she was borne, was cast out into a desert place, and full of rockes, where there was great store of birds, by whom through the will of God, she was nourished almost a yeare, then found by the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards, and brought vp by them. In like maner CYRVS, euen in his cradle was exposed to the beasts, and left in the midst of a forest; where a bitch gaue him suck, and kept him, till such time as a shepheard finding him, brought him to his Cabin. SEMIRAMIS purposing to conquer the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; and knowing how great an interprise it was, and that to put it in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution it behoued her to leuy great forces; she assembled an armie of three Millions of foote, fiue hundred thousand horsemen, and one hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand chariots: with which going into India, she was put to flight, and lost many of her people, returning without doing any thing. XERXES also going out of Asia into Greece with two Millions three hundred seeuenten
<pb facs="tcp:13829:58"/>
thousand fighting men, (whereof there were fower score thousand on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, fiue hundred seuenteene thousand on sea) was constrained shamefully to retire himselfe, seeing his Armie discomfited in many places. Likewise DARIVS his father assailed the Scythians, accompanied with eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand men; without reaping any praise of that voiage. And CYRVS warring against the Massagetes, was by THOMYRIS their Queene dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited with two hundred thousand Persians, and slaine the thirtieth yeare of his raigne. SEMIRAMIS and THOMYRIS, amongst the women of this former age, deserue to be accounted chiefe; thone hauing ruled the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Assyria, thother, that of the Massagetes: and they hauing surmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in glorie and great deeds, all other Queenes that euer were.</p>
               <p>SESOSTRIS diuided Egipt into six and thirtie Prouinces; establishing in each of them a Gouernour, aswel to receiue the reuenewes of the Crowne and royal tributes, as to take careful heed of the affaires concerning the good, and conseruation of them. DARIVS the first diuided the kingdom of Persia into twentie Satrapies; and in euery of them established a Satrape or gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: parting betweene them his yerely tributes, where, and how the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution should be made. This Darius going about to set vp his statue aboue that of Sesostris, in the Citie of Memphis, was put back by the high Priest, saying, that his deeds were not yet equall vnto those of Sesostris. The armies of Cyrus and Sesostris were equall in number of footemen, each of them hauing six hundred thousand: But Cyrus exceeded Sesostris in horsemen, assembling together six score thousand, where Sesostris had but fower and twentie thousand: but he had xxviij. thousand armed Chariots; whereas Cyrus had but two thousand.</p>

               <p>IN auncient time Religion onely was counted wisdom; and there were no other esteemed wise, but such as deliuered, and interpreted it vnto men: for ordinarily three things follow each other, RELIGION, WISDOM, and POWER: and little would either Lawes or Armes preuaile, if they were not holpen by Religion; which is the foundation, establishment, and conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of euery common wealth. RELIGION imprinteth, and retaineth in mens harts, the reuerence of GOD, and loue of their neighbour; ruling the exposition of the holie books, and the charges of persons appointed for diuine seruice. POLICIE conducteth the affaires of peace, and warre; in the which would not be found any iustice or fidelitie, without the feare of God, and loue towards men; which are especially commaunded in all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions. Wherfore in all Lordships, both auncient and moderne, the first care hath alwaies bin of Religion, and diuine seruice; and such as haue had the chargethereof, haue alwaies bin reputed the chiefest in aucthoritie, much

honoured and well intertained; being both they, and their children exempted from subsidies, and militarie labours.</p>

The Roialtie was mingled with sacrificing, and none could be king, but he were also a PRIEST, as Plato saith in his Politiks.</p>
               <p>The CHALDEES in Assyria and Media, had such aucthoritie, as the Egiptian priests in Egipt, being reputed most skilfull, and expert in Astrologie; by which they did prognosticate of things to come: and by sooth-sayings, and sacrifices, turned away euill fortunes, and made good to come.</p>
               <p>The BRACHMANES amongst the Indians held the chiefe place, to whom great honour was borne; and great giftes were giuen: as to men that were acceptable to the Gods; and thought to know whatsoeuer was done in Hell. They foretold at the beginning of the yeare, droughts, raines, windes, and diseases: And they indure still at this present in those parts, perseuering in the cerimonies of their auncient Religion; and holding the chiefe places in honour: calling themselues BRAMINS, which go before the NAIRES, that is to say, the Nobles. The King of <hi>Calecut</hi> is their high Priest, and head of his Religion, going for this cause before all the kings of India, and being called SAMORY, that is God in earth.</p>
               <p>The MAGES gouerned the Religion and estate of the Persians with such aucthoritie, that they interprised sometimes to vsurpe the kingdom, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Cambyses his absence in his voiage of Egipt; and to make one of them king. It was the custome also, that the king of Persia should learne their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke, without the which he might not raigne.</p>
               <p>The DRVIDES of Gaule being ministers of Religion, and of iustice, discoursed of the starres, and of their mouings; of the nature of things, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie of soules; as also of the diuine aucthoritie and prouidence: being greatly respected of all the rest, and verie well intertained.</p>
               <p>At Rome the SACERDOTES, ARVSPICES, AVGVRES, FLAMINS, SODALES, and virgins VESTALES, which kept the eternall fire, the high Priest, and inferiour Priests super-intende<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of their cerimonies, sacrifices, and supersticions, had knowledg of the Ciuil law; and managed the publike af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires. The first kings of Rome were sacrificers, and the Emperours to make their greatnes &amp; aucthoritie more venerable; called themselues high Priests.</p>
               <p>The PRIESTS both men and women ordained both in Greece and els<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, to see to the obseruation of the pagan Religion, founded on Oracles, were in great aucthoritie, and receiued mightie offerings. The Roialtie in Lacedemon was a superintendence in warre; and preheminence in sacrifices.</p>
               <p>The LEVITES in Iurie, separated from the other Iewes, to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise sacrificing; and the office of Priesthood in the race of AARON;
<pb facs="tcp:13829:59"/>
receiued dueties of inestimable value.</p>
               <p>The THALISMANS, PARACADIS, CADIS, Priests, and Iudges in the Law of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> MENITSSMARLS, and IMANS were wel priuiledged &amp; freed from all subsidies. At the beginning the CALIPHES in that religion were Kings and Priests, one in <hi>Bagdet,</hi> another in <hi>Caire.</hi> Sithence the <hi>Sultans</hi> haue taken the royal aucthoritie, and haue brought in the MVPHTIS, accounted as Patriarches, in steed of the CALIPHES super-intendents of the Religion, and iudging soueraignly in matters of the Law: by which are not onely occained the praiers, and diuine ceremonies; but also the politike and militarie affaires.

               <p>The ECCLESIASTICAL persons throughout Germanie, Fraunce, Poland, England, and Hungarie, hold at this day the chiefe places in the counsaile of Kings, and administration of iustice.

                  </hi> For considering that the Archbishops, and Bishops, are esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished amongst the people, as messengers of God, and interpreters of the Law, and will of God: to their aucthoritie being great in it selfe, haue bin added great honours in the common wealth; to the end that the publike cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailes, and constitutions, should by their presence be made more venerable. The POPE commaundeth ouer the temporall of the Church called S.

               <p>But before we make an end of this matter, we will set downe, the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and differences, which were betweene the Egiptian Priestes, and the Chaldees, Mages, Brachmanes, and the Druides. The EGIPTIANS and BABYLONIANS, dwelling in spacious plaines, and hauing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to hinder them from the whole view of the Heaueri, bestowed great studie in obseruation of the starres; in the which both thone and the other were most skilful, and expert. The Egiptians said that the CHALDEES came out of Egipt, and had learned Astrologie of them. The MAGES and BRACHMANES agreed in sobrietie and austeritie of life; and the Brachmanes were thought to haue discended of the Mages. There was also
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:13829:59"/>
the like similitude betweene the MAGES and DRVIDES, namely those of great Britaine, that they seemed to haue deliuered Magick to the Persians, and not to haue learned it of them. The bodies of the MAGES when they were dead, were left to the doggs and birds to pray vpon, before they were buried. The BRACHMANES voluntarily ended their liues by fire. The CHALDEES and EGIPTIANS had faire, great, and magnificent Temples: The MAGES had no temples, altars, nor images. The Mages were common both to the Persians, and Parthians. The CHALDEES to the Assyrians and Medes. The EGIPTIANS and the PERSIANS beleeued the Resurrection, and that men beeing raised from the dead, should be immortal: euen as the CHRISTIANS and SARAZENS beleeue.</p>

               <head>OF THE NOBILITIE AMONGST <hi>the Egiptians, Persians, Assyrians, Indians, Scythians, Thracians, and other auncient and moderne Nations.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THey indeed were reputed noble, in Egipt, Persia, Scythia, Iberia, Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, India, Thrace, and other auncient Nations, which made profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Armes; and medled not with mechanicall arts: to whom accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the qualitie of the Countrie, were appointed lands, rents, and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes, out of the publike, for their honest intertainment: and to the end they might not be constrained by want, to exercise any other questuarie, gainfull, and base maner of liuing. It was not lawful in EGIPT for men of warre called <hi>Culasyres</hi> and <hi>Hermotiuies,</hi> to vse any other art, but militarie: which they taught, and deliuered from hand to hand, and from the father to the sonne. LICVRGVS forbad the LACEDEMONIANS, all Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical arts and occupations; yea, euen merchandize and traficks: accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting such vocations to belong to bondmen, or strangers, or to men of base condition; and putting Armes onely in the hands of his Citizens, whom he would haue altogether free, and truely militarie. HER ODOTVS wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that the PERSIANS honoured valiant men of warre, more then all other Nations; and that they made no account of marchandise. Moreouer, that not onely the Persians, but also the Egiptians, Thracians, Scythians, Lydians, and almost all the barbarous Nations esteemed artisans, the basest of all men; yea, euen their children, and their whole race: That the GREEKS also, and aboue all, the Lacedemonians and Corinthians made little recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the artificers. And Plato in the second and eight booke of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, and in the beginning of his Timaeus, willeth the Nobles and men of warre, to abstaine from tilling the ground, and from Mechanicall artes, and other questuarie occupations. At this day the ARABIANS do vtterly detest all Mechanicall sciences: And the Nobilitie or Gentlemen of FRANCE are forbidden by the auncient ordinances of the Countrie, to exercise merchandize, or any other questuarie art, on paine of beeing
<pb facs="tcp:13829:60"/>
depriued of their nobilitie, and to pay taxe, as those of the common sort.</p>
               <p>The like do the NOBLES and Gentlemen of Spayne, Lumbardie, Naples, England, Germanie, Hungarie, and Poland: holding it a thing not onely vnworthy of Nobilitie; but also to be an act derogating from the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge thereof, to exercise in steede of Armes, a mechanicall art; or to vse trade of marchandize, if it be not of things of their owne growing; of which the traficke is permitted them. The Nobles of Persia vse it in like maner, possessing fees, and vnderfees, with vassals relieuing of them: also landes, castels, townes, and Countries, which they hold either by succession of their parents; or by giftes and benefites of the SOPHI their Prince: for the which they are bound to serue him in his warres; furnishing a number of men, according to the value of their reuenewes. And in INDIA, the Naires are held in such reputation, as the Gentlemen in these parts; being constrayned ordinarily to beare swords, targets, bowes, lances, and such other armes vsed amongst them: otherwise they should lose the name, and priuiledge of nobilitie.</p>
               <p>In TVRKIE there is no distinction of Nobilitie drawen from the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestours; but he onely amongst the Turkes is reputed noble, who in matter of warre hath giuen many proofes of his valiancie. When the OTTO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAN conquereth any Countrie, he extinguisheth the great ones, and the nobilitie, and sendeth thither his <hi>Sangiacques, Subassis,</hi> and <hi>Spachis;</hi> giuing them the fruites of the fees, and appointing rents on the reuenew of his lands, which are called <hi>Timarly.</hi> Euery SPACHI is bound to haue so many horses and men, as he hath fiue or six <hi>Aspers</hi> a day to spend, both of his pay, and of his <hi>Tymar,</hi> or yearely rent. They cannot make ouer the fees which they hold to their children, without the expresse permission of the great SIGNOR. And none enioyeth the nobilitie of any father, whose sonne he is, vntill by industrie he represent the person of his father, and not in word. None there possesseth any villages, castles, or townes, after the maner of the Persians, or of vs: or inhabiteth strong houses, or dareth to build aboue one storie, or higher then a douecote.</p>
               <p>In ENGLAND at this day, the Nobilitie do not dwell in castels or houses of strength, closed with motes and diches: neither haue they any iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction ouer men: which is in the kings hand, be it high, base, or meane. The dignities themselues, as Dukedomes, Marquisats, and Earledomes, are but titles which are giuen at the kings pleasure: whereas they which haue them, possesse nothing oftentimes in those places whereof they beare the name: but haue their lands lying elswhere.</p>
               <p>The Gentlemen in FRANCE possesse, in high, base, and meane iustice, villages, boroughes, townes, castels, fortresses, Baronies, Earledoms, Marqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sats, Dukedoms, Principalities, and Peereships patrimoniall: with vassals hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and vnderholding of them, bound by faith, and homage: which iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction notwithstanding dependeth on that of the king; and aunswereth at the last appeale to his soueraigne Courts, or Parliaments.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:13829:60"/>In the ROMAIN EMPIRE, the lands were first giuen in reward of seruice, to the men of warre, for terme of their liues; as they are at this day in Turkie: after they were made, and became patrimoniall and hereditarie to their children. And because they were giuen them to liue on in recompence of their seruices, they were termed benefits; and they which were recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced in such sort, were said to be beneficed, or benefited. Then by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the Church comming to be rich by the almesdeeds and foundations of Princes, and great Lords, they called the Archbishopricks, Bishopricks, Abbeies, Priories, and Cures; by the name of benefices: because the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical persons possessed them, after the same maner as the auncient men of warre did their fees, and benefices. The Emperour ALEXANDER SE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERVS, was the first that permitted the heires of those men of warre to inioy theis fees: prouided that they followed Armes, and not otherwise; or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayning most expresly, that such heritages should neuer fall, but into the hands of such as made profession of armes. And a while after him CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANTINE the great, at the beginning of his Empire, gaue to his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Captaines, and to those by whose meanes he thought most to preuaile against his aduersaries, a perpetuitie in the lands which were assigned them: Whereby one may know, that the estate of the Turke resembleth in many things the Romain Empire, and the auncient kingdom of Persia: in which the whole gouernment was in the disposition of one onely Lord; seruing himselfe with meane fellowes, which may without danger easily be aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to great charges, and honours; and without tumult or enuie abased, withdrawen, or put to death. But the FRENCH king is placed in the midst of an auncient Nobilitie, and companie of Princes, Earles, Barons, and other gentlemen; hauing subiects peculier to themselues, and holding their preheminence in the kingdom, of which they can hardly be depriued without sedition. The estates also of lands which were but for life, were made perpetuall vnder the last kinges of the race of Charlemaigne; and shortly vpon the comming of Hugh Capet. Then such Lords as held the great fees of the kings, they subdiuided them to other persons, of whom they expected seruice: and both thone and thother gaue their lands to the pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants, with dueties of rents; and with condition to receiue iustice of them. Wherehence are come the termes of fees and vnderfees, of vassals and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vassals, for a difference from them which relieue directly, and without any meane of the king; Consequently of <hi>Ban &amp; arriereban,</hi> and of liege or bond men, who without exception do promise all duetie of fidelitie to their Lords; and of those which are not bond or liege, which do onely promise a duetie, by reason of superiour estate or fee, of which theirs which is infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour dependeth. And although at the beginning it was not lawfull for any <hi>Roturier</hi> or common person, to possesse any fee simple, but to meddle onely with his traficke, tillage, or husbandrie; and to pay his Lords dueties: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding by succession of time, the fees (contrarie to their first and aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient institution) fell without any difference or distinction into the hands of
<pb facs="tcp:13829:61"/>
men of armes, and such as were estranged from the exercise of armes: of noble, and vnnoble, of gentlemen, and vngentle; as merchants, practicio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and other rich commoners, that had meanes to buy them. Moreouer, whereas many fees with their dueties were giuen by Kings, Princes, Lords, and Gentlemen, to Bishoprickes, Abbeies, monasteries, couents, priories, chanonries, commaunderies, hospitals, spittels, and to other Ecclesiasticall persons, which are people of Mortmaine; and altogether estraunged from armes; the <hi>Ban &amp; arriereban,</hi> hath bin much weakned thereby, and at length is so low brought, and so dispised; that euen they which are bound there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto thinke themselues dishonoured, if they appeare there: and so send thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their seruants, or other mercenarie folkes; the most part so euill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and in such poore equippage, that it is a mockerie to see them: whereas in times past, the chiefest of Fraunce accounted it a great honour to be there themselues in person. So farre haue these sees and vnder fees straied, or so ill bin imployed; which were erected and ordained for the safetie of the Countrie: to the end that such as held them, should in all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currents of businesse, be readily furnished with armes, men, and horses, in such number and order as is requisite; either to resist the approches of the enemie, or to set vpon him if need were. By reason whereof, the forces of the kingdom are lessned; and the Lawes militarie by little and little brought to naught: in such sort, that the Kings haue bin constrained to ordainè those companies of waged men of armes, called ordinances: and for their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, to impose on the people taxe and tallage.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, it is seuen or eight hundred yeres, since the Nobilitie hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp the vse of Armes, and scutchions, with figures of beastes, and other things, blazoned with diuers colours; with termes fitting therunto: to thend to discerne and make difference betweene them of their Nobilitie, and the antiquities thereof; their alliancies, and kinreds. Which maner was not in vse before CHARLEMAIGNE, and hath not gon out of EVROPE, being yet vnknowen throughout AFRICKE and ASIA: where their Religion forbiddeth them, to make the pourtraitures of beastes. The Armes in the which ther are Lyons, Leopards, Tygers, Eagles, Kytes, Faulcons, and other rauenous beastes, are accounted more noble, then those which haue but trees, flowers, starres, barres, files; or which are onely distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with colour; or taken from the names of families: because they seeme not to haue bin gotten by militarie prowesse; or any other vertue. To make them, correct, and expound them, are appointed the Herauldes, and kings of Armes; curiously discoursing of the figures, and colours which are in them: euen to the mingling, and accomodating (according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of their vnderstanding and knowledge) both Physicke, Astrologie, and Diuinitie.</p>

Then the Artisans there wrought their workes seuerally euery one by himselfe; and not indifferently mingling one occupation amongst the other. The like did the husbandmen, fishermen, and huntsmen: and it was not lawfull for one to exercise many trades. As then they applied not themselues, but vnto such workes as were permitted by the law; and which they had learned of their fathers: continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same all their life, they became excellent therein.

The Egip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, Babylonians, Indians, Mages, and Druides, applied themselues to such contemplation, as hath bin shewed heretofore; Then the GREEKS pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely obscuring their writings with numbers and figures, to thend, that (by being too much communicated) they should not be dispised of the vulgar sort, or wrapping them vp in couers of fables, or vsing measured verses, to make them more durable, by the delectation of fables, and sweetnesse of verses.</p>
            <p>And when as they that were skilfull in such thinges, and all such as were ought seen in any thing, would arrogantly be called <hi>Sophoi,</hi> that is to say wisemen: PITHAGORAS was the first, who by singular modestie tooke the name of a Philosopher, signifying a louer of wisedom: For com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming one day to Phliunta, and hauing learnedly and grauely talked with Leon Prince of the Phliases about certaine affaires: This Lord admiring the vnderstanding and eloquence of PITHAGORAS; demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of him, what Art he professed; by whom he was aunswered, that he was not skilfull in any Art, but that he was a Philosopher. Leon won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering at the noueltie of this name, asked him what Philosophers were; and what difference there was betweene them and others. PITHA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GORAS said, that the life of man seemed vnto him, to resemble one of those assemblies which were made at the publike playes of GREECE: where some by strength, agilitie, and exercise of bodie; or by running of horses, sought the price of the victorie, and the glorie proposed in races; others went thither to make their profite in buying and selling: but that there were some of a more generous spirite, which neither sought ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause, nor gaine; but came thither onely to see: Euen so men in this life, as in some famous faire, comming thither, and being of different nature and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, some sought after honour; others after profit; and others (which are the fewer and rarer sort) omitting or lettle esteeming all these thinges;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:13829:62"/>
considered diligently the nature of thinges: whome hee termed louers of wisedome; that is to say Philosophers. And as in these assemblies it was a goodly thing to see and beholde without seeking after gaine; so that in this life contemplation, and knowledge is to bee preferred, aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occupations. But PITHAGORAS was not onely the inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of the name, but also brought first (as hath bin said) this learning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to GREECE; which he augmented and beautified much: instructing his followers, called after him PITHAGOREANS, by whom he was singularly respected; and no lesse honoured of others thorough out the worlde: euen the memorye of him remaining at this present most renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and reuerenced thoroughout all nations; and will alwaies so remaine as long as learning endureth. Being borne at Samos, after hee had much profited in learning, he went first into Egypt; after into Babylon, to learne the course of the starres, and the nature of the worlde: And returned af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes by Crete, and Lacedemon, where he learned the Lawes of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos, and Lycurgus; which were then in great veneration: and finally ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing knowen all the foresaide thinges, hee came to <hi>Crotona;</hi> where hee withdrewe the people by his authority from luxuriousnes, and idlenesse, whereunto they were giuen, to good maners and honest life: hauing lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for the women separate from that which was for men, and for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren diuers from that which was for parents. For he taught women how they ought to liue chast, to be obedient and seruiceable to their husbands, and to children how they ought to be modest, and to learne knowledge: and to all people he gaue counsaile to liue soberly, as a thing of which all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues had their beginning. After hee had dwelled twenty yeeres at <hi>Croto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> hee went to <hi>Metapont,</hi> where he dyed; and the inhabitants of <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pont,</hi> after his decease had him in such reuerence, that they consecrated his house as a temple: and worshipped him as a God.</p>
            <p>In this time also were those seuen which were called, and reputed the wise men of Greece, namely <hi>Solon, Thales, Pittacus, Bias, Cleobulus, Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> and <hi>Periander;</hi> all which except <hi>Thales</hi> were either Law-makers, or gouernours of states: and got, that renowne and reputation of wisedome for being onely well skilled in matter of gouernment, and such thinges as are in the common vse of men. The other learned men of this age, and they also which succeeded them, were Astrologers, naturall Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and Physicians; as Democritus, Heraclitus, Hippocrates, Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docles, Parmenides, Melissus; and in the same age are also reckoned, Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sichorus, Simonides, Alceus, Sapho, Theognis, Anacreon, Archilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus, Alcmeon, and Epicharmus, who were Poets; Epimenides, a deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of Candie, Anacharsis the Scythian, Charondas, and Zaleucus Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers: Daniel, Aggee, Zachary, Ieremy, and Sophonie, prophets of the Hebrues.</p>
            <p>SOLON gaue Lawes to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> whereby he got great reputation, and excelled in al knowledge, especially in Poetry; wherunto if he had who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:13829:63"/>
giuen himselfe, he had bin no lesse reckoned of then <hi>Homer,</hi> and <hi>Hesiodus,</hi> or any other of the most excellent auncient Poets; as Critias witnesseth in Platoes Timeus. He being desirous to trauaile, went into Egypt to the king Amasis, and from thence came backe vnto Sardis, to CRESVS the riche and mighty king of Lydia: who for this cause thought himselfe the most happy man of the world. But hauing caused his treasures and worldly felicity to be shewed to SOLON; he asked him his opinion: who without flattery aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered him, that none ought to be iudged happy before his ende; Because that many in this present life after great felicities, fall into extreme miseries &amp; calamities: as eft soones it befel vnto Cresus, who being ouercome in war, and made captiue by CYRVS was bound, and set on a pyle to be burnt. Then he remembring the speech of SOLON named him thrice, with sigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and CYRVS vnderstanding the reason thereof had remorse; thinking how he being a man made an other to be burned quicke in the fire, which not long sit hence was no lesse happy, then him selfe. So fearing the diuine punishment, and considering that there is nothing stable in humain things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he commaunded that the fire should be forthwith extinguished, and Cresus be vnbound. By this meanes came Solon to the knowledge of Cyrus, and by his wife aduertisment saued the life of Cresus.</p>
            <p>EPIMENIDES was a familiar friend of Solons, and holpe him to make his Lawes; he was excellent in inuenting of diuers new things; and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in diuination. He foretold the comming of the Persians into Greece, a long time before they came: and that they should retourne without doing any thing.</p>
            <p>THALES a famous natural Philosopher and Astrologer, was the first amongst the Greekes that diuided the yere into ccclxv. daies: and found out the pointes of the Solstices, and Equinoxes; the little beare, and the starres a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him. He foretold the eclipse of the sunne in the raigne of Astyages the vncle of Cyrus, by his mothers side: and kept back his citizens the <hi>Milesians</hi> from entring into league with Cresus against Cyrus, which counsail was the cause of their safety after the victory. Aristotle in his Politicks writeth of him, that he foresaw by Astrology, the aboundance of oliues that was to come; wherin he might haue gained much: showing that it were easy for Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers to enriche themselues, if they would; but it is not their study and profession. And Plato in his Theaetetus telleth that as he beheld the starres, and looked vpwards, he fell into a diche: whereof he was reprehended by his maide (who was pleasant, and witty) that he woulde endeuour to know what was in heauen, being ignorant of that which was in earth, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his feete.</p>
            <p>DEMOCRITVS is called by Seneca in the seuenth of his naturall questions, the most subtill of the auncients; and in his booke of the shortnes of life, he reckoneth him amongst the chiefe and most excellent masters of the sciences. Cicero in his first Booke of the ends of good and euill, calleth him a man learned and perfect in Geometrie: and recommendeth his stile or maner
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:13829:63"/>
of writing; vnto Brutus in his Oratour; saying that albeit it be estraunged from verse; yet because it is eleuated and enriched, with most cleare lights of words, that it seemeth rather to be a poeme, then the verses of Comick Poets. Plinie telleth howe that hee and Pythagoras, trauailed into Persia, Arabia, Egypt, and Ethiopia, to the end to learne Magicke; and that they two were the first that did celebrate it in these parts. And in an other place, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest (saith hee) that DEMOCRITVS, a wise man otherwise, &amp; profitable vnto life; hath erred through too much desire which he had to be helpful vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And in his vij. Book; he promised saith he to reuiue others which hath not raised vp himselfe. He was so exceedingly giuen to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>templation, that his citizens the <hi>Abderites</hi> counted him franticke, and sent for Hippocrates to heale him: who, when he came to <hi>Abdera,</hi> found him only wise amongst them all. Seneca writing of the diuine prouidence, saith that he abandoned riches, thinking them to be burden som to a good wit. Some say that willingly with a burning glasse, he depriued himselfe of his sight, that he might see more clerly with his vnderstanding. Tully in his fifth Tusculane; DEMOCRITVS (saith he) hauing lost the sight of his eies, could not discerne white &amp; black; but wel could he the good, and euil; iust and vniust; honest and dishonest; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and vnprofitable: And could liue wel and happely without the sight of colours; but not without the knowledge of things. This ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thought the sight of the mind to be hindred by the sight of the eies. And as others did not see oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that which was before their feet; so he wandered throughout al infinity without consisting in any extremity. Plutarch in his treatise of curiosity affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it to be false. Seneca in his second Booke of Anger, saith that HERA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CLITVS going out of his house, and seeing about him so many liuing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil, or rather dying in euil, he had pity of them all, and wept: on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry DEMOCRITVS was neuer seene but laughing.</p>
            <p>HIPPOCRATES had his honor, to haue bin the first that did write perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuously of Physick, &amp; of the rules therof. Plutarch witnesseth of him, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing written touching the seames or ioinings of mans head in Anatomy, and afterwards finding that he had failed in somwhat, he did publickly declare his fault, for feare lest others might fall into the like errour. Saint Augustin after him hath bin the only man that hath publickly corrected himselfe, by setting forth his retractations. Others are commonly so ouergon with glory, and so opinatiue; that they had rather dye, then yeld in any thing.</p>
            <p>EMPEDOCLES the <hi>Agrigentine,</hi> a famous natural Philosopher, wrote in verse vj<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> books of the knowledg of nature: wherof Aristotle maketh often me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, especially in his Poetry; where he saith that Homer &amp; Empedocles had nothing one like thother, but their verses: and that the one is a right Poet, and thother ought rather to be called a naturall Philosopher, then a Poet. And in his Metaphysicks speaking of him and of Anaxagoras, he witnesseth that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naxagoras was superior in age to Empedocles, but inferior to him in works. And he saith in his problemes, that he was of melancholick co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plexion. Plinie saith that he trauailed far to learne Magick; as did Pithagoras &amp; Democritus.
<pb facs="tcp:13829:64"/>
And Horace in his art of Poetry, that being desirous to leaue an opinion of himselfe that he was a God, and was vanished secretly out of the sight of men; he cast himselfe into the burning and smoking hole of the hil Etna: and that this deed was afterwardes discouered by one of his slippers, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made of bras, was cast vp by the vehemency of the fire and wind.</p>
            <p>ANAXAGORAS a <hi>Clazomenian</hi> gentleman, became a very excellent Philosopher, and was called by those of his time <hi>Nous</hi> (which signifieth the minde or vnderstanding) were it for admiration which they had of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and vnderstanding which appeared to be great, especially in naturall Philosophy; or els because he was the first which added the intelligence vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the matter; and appointed vnto naturall things, for their beginning, and first cause of their distinction and ordinance, the intelligence. Plinie writeth of him, that by knowledge of the starres hee foretolde, that within certaine daies after, there would fall a stone from heauen: which happened in the parts of Thrace, in the day time. He was the first that published books writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by him, and liued in the time of Democritus.</p>
            <p>In auncient time in Greece they which did write first of diuine, celestial, naturall, morall, politicke, and military matters were the Poets: and they were commonly Priests, Theologians, Musicians, Astrologians, and Physicians; as Linus, Musaeus, Orpheus, and Amphion. LINVS the sonne of Apollo, and of Terpsichore being very skilfull in Musick, was the master of Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, of Tamyras, and of Orpheus. They say that he brought the knowledge thereof out of Phenicia into Greece; as did Atlas the Astrology out of Lybia. Museus was reputed as a Prophet hauing deliuered many Cerimonies to the Grecians: of whom Virgill giueth a very honourable testimony, in the sixth Booke of his Aneids, calling him an excellent Poet in great perfection: and making him to seeme in the Elysian fields the most eminent amongst all the men of honour, and learning that were there; which haue had a memorable name in all ages. ORPHEVS and AMPHION were such excellent musicions, that they were said by their sweete Songes to moue trees, and stones; to stop the course of riuers, and to tame the fiercenes of wild beasts. ORPHEVS first instituted in Greece the Initiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the Gods, the purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of sinnes, remedies of diseases by charmes, and Inchauntmentes; and meanes to appease the wrath of the Gods. They say that of him and of Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roaster as fathers and authors, came al the ancient wisedome. Iamblicus affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that Pythagoras followed Orpheus his diuinity as a paterne; on the which he framed, &amp; formed his Philosophy; &amp; which is more that the words of Pythagoras, had not bin esteemed holy or sacred, but for being deriued from the precept of Orpheus. That from thence came the secret doctrine of numbers, and whatsoeuer is admirable in the Philosophy of the Greeks, which secrets he folded vp in fables, and hid them vnder a poeticall couer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Demosthenes in his oration against Aristogiton calleth Orpheus the authour of the sacred cerimonies which the Grecians vsed. He was accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted holy after his death, and euery yere there was a solemne feast dedicated vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:13829:64"/>
him, as to the most learned which was euer in Greece, as wel in the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and diuinity of those daies as in Poetry.</p>
            <p>Vnto these succeeded HOMER, and HESIOD, who were of the same time, or neer one to another: &amp; got by different vertues very great, &amp; du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable praises. Homer wrote the Iliads, and Odyssees; Hesiodus left precepts of husbandry and Astrology, entermingled with aduertisments of good life, and the fabulous genealogie of the Gods. Homer without controuersie hath gotten the first and chiefe place amongst all the Poets of al Nations; and ages which euer were. And Plinie giueth him the chiefe praise of humaine vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, in so great diuersity of natures, multitude of disciplines, variety of actions, and of exercises, and workes; hauing deserued it as well by the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of his poesie; as by the good happ of his argument so luckely handled. First that which he writeth, he seemeth not to say it; but to represent it before our eyes. Such is the dexterity in him not onely to expresse the bodies; but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the hidden motions of the mindes: in such sort that his poesie seemeth as an Image of the life of man. He is so conformable to common sense, and hath so aptly accomodated his wordes to the things, that after so great mutation come to passe, in the maners, and customes of men, from the time wherein he liued vntill this present; ke keepeth still from age to age, and from countrey to countrey the same grace, as if he came from being newly made; retayning not only the authority of antiquitie but also the pleasure of nouelty: as if there were in him some spirit continually renewing, and waxing yong, and a soule neuer waxing old which kept him alwaies in this vigour. Such force haue the writings which come neere vnto nature, that they neuer decay: but so much farther as they go, so much more grace they gaine, and so much more authority they obtaine. Amongst his singuler praises this of all other is most veritable, that he is alone in the world who hath neuer glutted or cloyed his readers; shewing himselfe alwaies altogither of an other sort vnto them, and still florishing in newe delectation: for as much as he leadeth them from one tale to another; and by his variety keepeth them from being weary at any time to heare his fine verses, flowing from him of their owne accord with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paine or constraint; euen almost with a diuine felicity, and naturall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility: which notwithstandieg he hath so conducted, that he obserueth gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity in great affaires; and propriety in small matters; and a tempered de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency in those of the middle sort: with a delectable variety thoroughout in his narrations; similitudes, orations, amplifications, arguments, examples, and digressions; in wordes, sentences, figures, and in the continuation of his purpose, such disposition; that one may well say there was neuer his like. Aristotle, and Cicero thinke that he could not possibly come incontinently to such perfection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that therefore there were others before him: seeing that nothing is perfect at his birth, and first beginning. The Greeks had him in such admiration that they attributed to him the knowledge of all things; and thought that all Artes, and all sects which were amongest them, were
<pb facs="tcp:13829:65"/>
issued from his fountaine. The most renowmed Captaines red him, finding in him the best that belongeth to art military; The most eminent Philosophers alleaged him, prouing their reasons by his verses: others founded in him the state politicke, and oeconomicke, the art of husbandry, the contempt of humaine vanities, and the deuotion due vnto religion. For this cause (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he being far from ambition had concealed his original) many nations clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him to be their Citizen: as the Colophonians, Rhodians, Chiotins, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laminians; and Smirnians, who erected a temple vnto him in their City; and many others contended for him amongst themselues. But he iudged best, who considering so many vertues and graces in him, thought it not possible that he could be ingendred of man; but that the heauen was his father and Calliope the chiefe of the Muses his mother.</p>
            <p>Touching HESIODVS (which holdeth among the Greek Poets the second place, after Homer) he gaue men to vnderstand, that he became such without study; and that in his yong yeres being sent by his father to keepe the beastes, he fell a sleepe on the hill Parnassus: During which sleepe, the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses appeared vnto him, and inspired him diuinely with Poesie. Afterward he was the Priest and Curate of the Muses in Helicon; and wrote of Astrology, and Husbandry. Plutarch telleth how he being wrongfully slaine and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, and then cast into the sea; was taken vp by a flote of Dolphins, which caried him to the head of Rhion neere the towne of Molicria: where being knowen by reason that he was but newly killed; the Molycrians because of his great renowme, buried him honourably; and nothing in more recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, then to send presently euery where to enquire of this murther: which they did with such diligence, that the murderers were found out: whom they cast quicke into the botome of the sea, and razed their houses.</p>
            <p>But the wise men, and religious of that time, did blame the impertinent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles which Homer, and Hesiod and thother Poets had written of the Gods, proposing their formes, ages, sexes, transformations, vestments, ornaments, banquets, laughters, desires, complaints, lamentations, displeasures, angers, hatreds, differents, discords, combates, warres, and battailes; not onely when diuers Gods defended contrary armies of thone side, and thother; but also when they warred themselues against the Titans, and Gyants: their whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, adulteries, incests, bonds, companies with mankinde, and mortal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred of the immortall; and many other such things transferd to the simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of humaine fragility, and contrary to good maners, and to pietie. Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras said that he had discended into hell, and had seen there the soule of Hesiodus, hard bound to a piller of bras; and that of Homer hanged on a tree: both of them bearing the punishment of that which they had foolishly fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and inuented of the Gods. Isocrates affirmed, that although they had not yet bin sufficiently chastised for these impieties; yet not withstanding that they remained not altogither vnpunished: some of them hauing bin vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds and beggers; others of them blinde; and others banished their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; and that Orpheus the chiefe authour of such fables was slaine and rent
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:13829:65"/>
in pieces; and his members dispersed here and there thoroughout the fields. Plato allowed them no place in his common wealth by reason of such absurd impieties; but woulde haue those onely receaued there, which made diuine hymnes, or moral aduertisments. And therefore I meruail at the Poets of these times, who that they may seeme the more to resemble the auncients by ymita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, endeuour to bring into vse such pagan fictions: not considering the Christian religion, in the which they are brought vp, free from all such su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition; &amp; the maners of their time: whereunto al writers both in prose, and verse ought especially to accommodate themselues.</p>
            <p>After the said Poets, came the PHILOSOPHERS, which began in the raigne of Cyrus, as hath bin touched heretofore: and they wrote at first al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most al in verse, as the former; and diuided themselues into two sects, thone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called <hi>Ionicques,</hi> thother <hi>Italiques.</hi> Thales being born at Miletum in Ionia, was the author of the Ionian sect; Pythagoras the Samian dwelling at Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tona, in that part of Italy which was called great Greece, instituted the Italia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whose sectaries, &amp; folowers were called of him Pythagoreans: teaching their doctrines by numbers, and figures. After Thales succeeded Anaximander, and after Anaximander, Anaximenes; to him Anaxagoras, to Anaxagoras, Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las; &amp; to Archelas, Socrates. On thother part to Pythagoras succeeded his son Telanges, to him Xenophanes; after him Permenides, after him Zenon the Eleatian, and Melissus; To Zenon, Leucippus, to Leucippus, Democritus, &amp; to Democritus many: amongst whom are celebrated Nauciphanes, and Nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides: and other renowmed in both sects euen to PLATO, and ARISTO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TLE; who abolished these sects, bringing in others of the <hi>Academicks,</hi> and <hi>Peripateticks:</hi> &amp; supplanting the renowne of those which had begon them: as the Macedonian Alexander supplanted the glory of Cyrus, and of the kings his successours, by ouerthrowing the Persian Monarchy.</p>
            <p>But the greatest glory of the GREEKS began, at the expedition which XERXES king of Persia had vndertaken against Greece; who by his inesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable power which he brought with him, amazed it much, and put the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians in the greatest feare, that euer they were; knowing wel that this war was vndertaken against them to bring them al in bondage: and seeing that already all the Grecian cities seated in Asia were become subiect, and seruile; they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that those of Greece should not escape with any better condition. And on the contrary the war hauing had a far other end then was looked for, they not only found the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues out of danger of seruitude; but got great glory ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: and there was neither towne nor city but was become so rich, that all the world wondered how things were so come to passe, contrary to that which euery one expected. For from that time fifty yeres forwards, Greece alwaies increased meruailously in felicity: &amp; their prosperity and wealth made arts to florish. In such sort that we find, that the most excellent workmen that euer were in the world, liued in that time there. Also the sciences, &amp; namely Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy, went then wonderfully forwards. Eloquence also was much aduanced throughout all Greece; but especially in <hi>Athens.</hi> For in that time were these

            <p>Concerning the <hi>Art Militarie,</hi> Philip, &amp; Alexander of Macedonia, did not only surpasse al the great Captains of their time, in knowledge, &amp; experience of war, prowes, magnanimity, fortune, &amp; succes of conquest: although there were many famous me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their age; as Epanimondas, &amp; Pelopidas, Thebans; Timotheus, Conon, Chabrias, &amp; Iphicrates, Athenia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; &amp; not lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g before, Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanias, Lysander, &amp; Agesilaus, Lacedemonians; &amp; Timoleon of Corinth: but also those of the times of the Persian &amp; Median wars: as Themistocles, Aristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, Cymon, &amp; Miltiades; &amp; afore them Conon, Myronides, Pericles, &amp; some other Grecians: and in Sicilie Gelon, the sonne of Diomenes. For who so wil compare the vertues of al them, with the deeds &amp; glory of Philip, and Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander; he shal find their vertue, and renowne more excellent then of thothers: and that they haue left them a great space behinde. PHILIP at his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, hauing but smal meanes; made in the end his kingdome more mighty and more redoubted, then any other Lordship of his time in all Europe: and finding at his comming to it, the kingdome of Macedon, handmaid, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butary to the Illyrians; he made it ere he dyed, Lady and mystresse of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Cities, diuers Countries, and Nations, bordering about her. He made
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:13829:66"/>
himselfe by his owne vertue to be chosen Chiefetaine general of all Greece; the Grecian Cities voluntarily submitting themselues to his gouernement. And after he had ouerthrowen by force of armes those which had sacked, and spoiled the temple of Apollo at Delphos; and had made free, the accesse of the Oracle: he obtained a place, and voice in the Counsaile of the States of Greece called the <hi>Amphictyones:</hi> which was giuen and graunted him for reward of his vertue and deuotion showed towards the Gods. Then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing subdued to his will the Illirians, Pannonians, Thracians and Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians; hee vndertooke to ouerthrowe the Empire of Persia. Following which deliberation, he sent his army before into Asia; where he set at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the Greeke Cities that were seated there: But being ouertaken by death he could not make an end of his enterprise; but left to his sonne, and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour Alexander such, and so great power, that de had no need afterwards else where to seeke any ayde or succour to ruinate the Empire of Persia. All which great things he did not with the fauour of fortune; but by his owne onely vertue; being a very wise Prince, especially in matter of warr; valiant of his person, affable, and as liberall as any prince might be.</p>
            <p>Touching his sonne ALEXANDER, hee did in a little time many great things; and by his good wit, and valure excelled all the kings that were euer renowmed for their great deedes, since the world was first a worlde. For in the space of twelue yeres which he raigned and no more, he conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a good parte of Europe; and euen almost all Asia thoroughout: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he got of good right exceeding great glory, and not inferiour to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Princes of auncient time: who for the greatnes and excellency of their deedes and vertues haue bin reuerenced by their posterity as demy Gods. From his childhood he gaue euident tokens of his greatnes, to ensue; Hee tooke no pleasure in women, nor in plaies, nor any other kind of pastime: but his whole and onely delight was in armes. And the more he sawe his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Philip to prosper, the more sory he was; saying that hee would leaue nothing for him to doe. When the other yong Lordes of his age inuited him to goe to the Olympian games; he aunswered them that he would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly goe, if hee thought he shoulde finde any Kings there, with whome he might combat and iust. The Ambassadours of the king of Persia hauing talked with him, said that they founde in him more magnanimity then his age could beare. King Philip being desirous to knowe who should be his successour, sent to the Oracle of Apollo, at Delphos; where hee had aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere that he should succeed him in his kingdome, and enjoy the empire of the whole world, whome the horse Bucephalus would suffer to get vp on him: The which fell out to be true in Alexander. For this Bucephalus was a horse of singuler beauty, but fierce, and not to be ruled by others; which showed himselfe so tractable vnto Alexander, that hee might doe with him what he would: who kept him long, reseruing him for battails, or daungerous passages. But such was the hap of Alexander, that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer sought battaile but he wan; and neuer besieged fortresse, but he tooke it.
<pb facs="tcp:13829:67"/>
While he was yet but yong and euill-furnished with money, and hauing but thirty fiue, or fortye thousand men of warr; he was so hardy and aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous as to passe the sea, and to goe into Asia to assaile the king of Persia, the greatest, and most mighty king of the world, very farre into his owne kingdome: whome he discomfited three times, putting to flight the armies of his aduersarie; whereof the least was of foure or fiue hundred thousand fighting men. After which ouerthrowes, the king of Persia offred him two thousand talents, and a part of his kingdome, to raunsome his mother, his wife and his daughters: but he would not restore them; giuing a magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous aunswere, that as the worlde could not be guided by two sunnes; so that there could not be two soueraigne kingdomes; while the habitable earth remained. Hauing conquered the whole estate of Persia, he marched with his army euen to the extremities of the East, thorough such rough and long waies for the most part, and amongest so many different nations; that with great difficulty might one goe thithen being lightly furnished on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe or on foote: besides the daunger of fighting. Then retourning out of India to Babylon, he was saluted king of all the world, being about xxxiij. yeares of age; by Ambassadours, sent from Carthage, and from the rest of Africke: from the Spaynes and Gaules, from Sicilie, Sardigna, and Italy. Such was the terrour of his name, and the reputation of his greatnesse, and felicity. And hauing ouercome the East, he threatned Carthage; preparing great armies both by sea, and land to conquere the West; hauing purposed to marche thorough Africke euen to the pillars of Hercules; and to passe at the straights into Spaine; then from thence to retourne by Gaule, and Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into Greece, when he dyed in the midst of his enterprises and victories. He was so ambitious, that vnderstanding how the Philosopher Democritus affirmed that there were many worldes; he lamented that he was so long in getting of this one: and was sory that he could not sooner inuade the rest. He called himselfe the sonne of God, and would be worshipped accordingly; And after he was dead, his body remained seuen daies without stinke or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: which confirmed the opinion that was held of his diuinity.</p>
            <p>Thus much touching the excellency of armes that was then: and it shal not be besides our purpose to treate a little of that of learning; which wil be found to be no lesse in Plato, and Aristotle according to their quality.</p>
            <p>These two then set Philophy as high as euer it was; and haue surmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not only the other former Philosophers both Greeks and straungers; but also had neuer since their equals. In so much that the world holdeth of them at this present; the most part of that knowledge which it hath: those books of theirs which remaine, being translated into all languages; and disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed into all nations: They haue knowen whatsoeuer it was possible to know in their time, and whereunto the vnderstanding of man could then attaine. There is no liberal knowledge, nor art, nor science whatsoeuer; wherof they haue not spoken pertine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly &amp; properly. There is nothing in the heauen, in the earth, nor in the sea, which they haue omitted. Wherunto the better to attaine
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:13829:67"/>
they chose a maner of liuing quiet, and peaceable, fit for learning, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation: which as neerest approaching to the heauenly life, they thought worthiest of a wise man. They shunned publick charges, full of enuy, and of trauailes: seeking rest that they might study, and write.</p>
            <p>PLATO, after he had long time conuersed with Socrates, and hauing bin in Italie, Sicile, and Egypt; although he loued well his Countrey, and vnderstoode well matter of gouernement; yet notwithstanding would not meddle with the common wealth, because hee sawe the people of Athens euen to dote with old age; and to be neere their end: but employed all the time of his life, in learning, and seeking of truth; showing by wordes, by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and by deedes, the way of vertue to those that would follow it. There is such maiesty in his speach, that it hath bin thought, if God would haue vsed the language of men, that he would not haue spoken otherwise, then as Plato did. And Cicero calleth him the Father not onely of knowledge, but also of speaking well: hauing a stile in a meane betwixt prose, and verse; yet som-what neerer approching to that of Homer. And where the Greeks went before into strange countries to study; the strangers began in his time to come to Athens to learne knowledge.</p>
            <p>Likewise, ARISTOTLE was honourably sent for by King Philip, who esteemed it much, that he had such a person borne in his owne kinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and in his time; And especially for the instruction of his sonne Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander: where hauing remained eight yeres, howbeit he had great credit in the Court of Macedon, and might haue come to great Offices, and riches: he retired himselfe notwithstanding to Athens, to spend there the rest of his life in learning. And whereas in any one particuler science, one shall hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attaine to any excellency, though he vse no other exercise all his life; he excelled in whatsoeuer he would apply himselfe vnto: and neuer vndertooke to intreate of anything, but he brought it almost to his soueraigne perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: wherein he was much holpen by the quicknes of his wit, and sharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of his vnderstanding, his inclination to learning, and perseuerance: the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent learning of his master Plato, whose auditor he was by the space of xx. yeres; the happines of that age wherein he was borne, ful of good bookes, and rich in all arts: and the liberality of his scholer Alexander; who supplied him with goods, to come to his intention.</p>
            <p>Many debate, who was euer of greatest vnderstanding amongst men; the which is difficult to be decided. Notwithstanding if we consider it wel, we shall not finde any more admirable, then ARISTOTLE: for the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the workes which he hath composed; and the worthynes of the matters of which he hath intreated. PLATO hath not giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> himselfe so much to natural Phylosophy, as ARISTOTLE, but hath bin very curious of <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Politick:</hi> and excellent in <hi>Metaphysick:</hi> Thone hath intreated of the creation of the world, of the figures, qualities, &amp; motions of the foure ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: of which the world is compounded. He set downe three principles, God, the <hi>Idea</hi> or for me, and the first matter; being the nurse of all generation.
<pb facs="tcp:13829:68"/>
Thother goeth about to proue that the world is eternall, setting downe also three principles, yet different from thother: namely, matter, forme, and priua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He disputeth of place, of voide, of time, of motion, of generation, and corruption; of the foure elements; of mutations happened in the aire: he hath declared the birth, liues, figures, parts, inclinations, affections, and actions of all liuing creatures. His scholer Theophrastus, hath shewed the natures, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and reasons of plants; &amp; other things growing on the earth. Both of them haue written of the soul. But PLATO speaketh more certainly of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality therof, then ARISTOTLE. PLATO hath discoursed of a perfect common wealth, of lawes, and of vertues, largely. ARISTOTLE also hath composed many books in Morall philosophy, deducing al the parts thereof euen to the <hi>Economick.</hi> Moreouer he hath gathered the institutions, and disciplines, of the Common weales and kingdomes of his time, and of such as florished before him. Thone and thother haue shewed the changes which happened in them, and the meanes how to remedy them. As concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Logick;</hi> Aristotle attributeth to himselfe the inuention, and perfection thereof. He hath also spoken of <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> and of <hi>Poesie</hi> so exactly, that there is none found better in these professions. Moreouer PLATO hath written in dialogues: in the which commonly he bringeth in SOCRATES, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring nothing; but disputing much of things both affirmatiuely, &amp; negatiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: enquiring of all things, and asking the opinion of the assistants or standers by; without saying his owne, or resoluing of anything. Which maner of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting hath great efficacy; and maketh things more intelligible: as if they were then doing, and were not taken from else-where, obseruing the dignity of the persons introduced; &amp; accomodating of apt speach vnto euery one according to the variety: which causeth an exceeding pleasure. In doing wherof, he hath folowed an elegant maner of writing, magnificent, ful of maiesty; and grauity both in words, and sentences; enriched with translations, allegories, and other colours of Rhetorik; without obseruing, any certaine methode of teaching. But ARISTOTLE hath endeuoured to write methodically; hee expresseth himselfe according as the matter requireth properly, &amp; without any exquisite ornament of words: That which he vndertaketh to treate off, he pursueth it from the beginning vnto the end, not digressing any waies; &amp; leaueth nothing vndecyded. Many haue blamed him for hauing made himselfe purposely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure; and ambiguous, in many places: and that he did it of craft; fearing least some should handle him in such sort; as he had handled others. PLATO is more copious, ARISTOTLE more pithy; Thone hath mingled many stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge opinions in his books, as of the transmigration of soules out of one body into another; of the communion of wiues, of children, and of goods: Thother hath more conformed himself to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon life; &amp; to ciuil actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. Thone hath chiefly stood on intelligible things; &amp; thother on things se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sible. Thone hath searched throughout for <hi>Ideas,</hi> &amp; formes; thother made but a iest therof; as of the former opinions which he hath sharply reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded: notwithstanding many haue bin of opinion, that there was no differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce between the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in sentences<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in words
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:13829:68"/>
only: &amp; haue assaied to reconcile them. Finally, the Greeks reckoned the one diuine; and his doctrine hath bin much honoured, both whiles he liued, and after his decease. Thother hath bin held for a wonderfull man, of great iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and incomparable knowledge; singularly respected and reuerenced of all that haue sithence giuen themselues to learning. In briefe, ARISTO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TLE learned all the good which he knew, of PLATO, and it was a meruailous great happines vnto him, to haue bin both a scholler of the most excellent philosopher that hath euer bin knowen; and Master of the greatest King of the world.</p>
            <p>It were not reasonable here to omit DEMOSTHENES, who was a diligent hearer of Plato, and a friend vnto Aristotle: being so accomplished in eloquence, that he is accounted the law, and the rule of peroring, and spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king well. There is such force in his words, and he hath so well disposed them; that one cannot well add any thing to them, or take ought from them. It is not possible in those causes which he hath handled, and in the Orations which he hath written, wisely to inuent, or subtilly to expresse any thing; but he hath well vnderstood it: Neither on the contrarie, to find any thing more stately, more graue, or more beautified; then that which he hath said, and written. For he was so studious and laborious, that euen till the fiftieth yeare of his age, there was neuer found any Artisan in Athens more diligent to rise early then he. And although he had many imperfections of nature; as being subiect to stammering in his speach, short breathed, and timerous: he ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came by diligence and industrie, all his hinderances. And vsed himselfe in such sort, that there was no Oratour in his time (albeit there were then many excellent) that pronounced more cleanly and distinctly, or spake longer, and bolder then he. Moreouer, he was no smal personage: but had while he liued great authoritie throughout Greece, being feared and redoubted by the king of Macedon, honoured by the great Signor of Persia, who managed long the affaires of Athens, where he was borne. By reason whereof, he well vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood matters of state, the mutations which happen in Lordships, and the causes wherehence they proceede: and there is not any thing necessarie for publike gouernment; but some apparance therof is found in him; his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailes tending not onely vnto profit, but to honour, and honestie. In somuch, that Plato, and Aristotle, haue not better plaied the Philosophers in their schooles; then he did in publike assemblies, and iudgements.</p>
            <p>But as this age was admirable in power and wisdom, and in all arts: so was it also full of wickednes, &amp; extraordinarie changes: As if it had bin of necessitie, that the same age must bring forth horrible monsters, &amp; notable wonders: for it is commonly seen, that where mens wits are most excellent, there are found together men notably vicious, &amp; vertuous; the authours of great good things &amp; of euil: as if vertue and vice (which are things so contrary &amp; repugnant) had their extremities neer one an other: In such sort, that where thone is, the other estsoons accompanieth it; &amp; they leaue not one the other: for euen as noble &amp; generous natures being duly instructed becom perfectly good, &amp; are causes of
<pb facs="tcp:13829:69"/>
great good things; In like maner those that are euill brought vp, become ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding euill, and do great mischiefes: by reason that the exorbitant wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse, and extreme vices proceede not of weake, and simple natures; but of the noble and generous, being depraued by institution. As appeared in this season, replenished with all good artes, and excellent wits, by the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie mutations which happened therin: Wherof the Orator AESCHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NES complayning, cried out, that they led not then the life of men; but that they seemed to be born to that end that their posterity might tel of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> strange and vnlooked-for maruailes: And DEMOSTHENES answering him, acknowledged the fortune of his time to be verie aduerse, and hard; and that there was neither Greeke nor Barbarian, but had suffered much: for not onely euery one in particuler; but publickly the kings, Cities, and Nations receiued great calamities: First of all, what troubles raised king Philip tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough out all Greece; corrupting by giftes the Magistrates and Gouernours of Townes; and nourishing amongst the Greekes diuisions and parcialities? In such sort, that he himselfe confessed, that he had much more inlarged his kingdom by gold and siluer, then by armes. And albeit the Athenians hauing alwaies in suspition his greatnes, were exhorted continually by DEMOS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THENES, to take vpon them the protection of the common libertie; and to punish with death those Citizens whom they should find to go about to betray the common wealth: Notwithstanding, this great Orator could not with all his diligence refraine the euill inclination of some particulars; which sought but how to sell their Countrie: Such abundance of Traitours there were found in that season. Afterwards as Philip being become proud by many prosperities, for the greatnes of his power, placed himselfe amongst the twelue Gods, he was killed by Pausanias a Macedonian gentleman, to whom he had denied iustice; at the mariage of his daughter Cleopatra, which he solemnized with great triumphe, beholding the plaies which were made: and euen in the midst of his guard, betweene the two Alexanders, the one being his sonne, and thother his sonne in law, whom he had made king of Epirus. The fault of which murther, was for the most part imputed to the Queene Olympias, who being diuorced from him, stirred vp the youngman boyling before with anger to do it. But there was also some suspition which touched Alexander, doubting least he would leaue the kingdom to an other: Who likewise after he had turned all topsie turuie in Europe, and in Asia; because of his insolencie, was poisoned by his most familiar friends. Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pias, wife of the one, and mother to the other, was massacred by Cassandra for the great arrogancie which was in her; and cruelties which she had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. Seneca calleth Alexander a furious young man; hauing in steed of vertue, a fortunate temeritie; and that from his youth he was a theese, and a distroier of people: being the ruine both of his enemies, and friends; who placed his soueraign felicitie in astonishing, and making himselfe feared of all men. Furour saith he, stirred vp the wicked man to vndoe other men; and made him to march thorough vnknowen places: Account you him wise that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:13829:69"/>
began with the ruines of Greece, in the which he had bin bred and brought vp; taking from euery one that which was his good? He constrained Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demon to serue, and Athens to be silent. Not content with the ruine of so many Cities, which Philip either bought or ouercame; he ouerthrew others also; and beareth armes thorough out the world, without satisfying his cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: after the maner of sauage beastes, which bite being not pressed with honger. He hath alreadie gathered many Kingdomes into one; alreadie the Greekes, and Persians do feare one king; and notwithstanding, passing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Ocean, he is sorie and loath to bound his victories by the footsteps of Hercules, and of Bacchus: but will force nature; and can not stay; as heauie things which do not cease to roule, vntill they meete with some stop or hinderance. He saith, that Philip and Alexander, and other such like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed, thorough the ruine of people, haue bin no lesse plagues vnto men, then the deluge, by which the earth was drowned: or then the burning which consumed by heat, and drougth, a great part of lyuing creatures. Lucan thinketh, that he gaue a pernicious example to the world; shewing the meanes how to reduce so many Countries vnder one Lord; calling him the fat all euil of the world; and a lightning which strook all Nations: whose insatiable ambition could not be staied, but by death. Therefore the Scythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans spake thus vnto him; What neede hast thou of riches, which constraine thee alwaies to desire? Thou art the first, which of abundance hast made indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence: to the end that by possessing more, thou mightst more earnestly desire that which thou hast not. Who would euer haue thought that the Greekes should haue ruled Asia? and that so meane a king, as that of Macedon, could haue ouerthrowen the Monarchie of Persia, of inestimable largenesse and power, both by land and sea?</p>
            <p>In like maner, the Lordship of DIONISE in <hi>Sicile,</hi> was ouerthrowen by DION with little meanes, against the opinion and expectation of all the world: which was the greatest and mightiest that was then in Europe: for who could haue beleeued, that he which arriued in Sicile onely with two ships of burden, should haue ouercome a Lord, that had in his disposition fower hundred vessels with oares, a hundred thousand foote, and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand horsemen; with prouision and munition, of armes, corne, and money, as much as was needfull for intertainment of so great power? and who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all the forenamed things, had vnder his obedience one of the greatest, and most mightie Cities, which was then in all Greece: which had-so many ports; so many arsenals, or store-houses so many impregnable castles? and who besides all this, was allied with many great and mightie confederates? But that which gaue DION the victorie in this interprise, was principally his magnanimitie, and greatnesse of courage: with the loue and good will which was borne him, of those whom hee came to set free: And that which holpe him yet more then all the rest was, the small valure; and the cowardize of the Tyrant: with the hate and euill will which was borne him of all those, whom he vniustly detained in bondage, and seruitude.
<pb facs="tcp:13829:70"/>
All which causes at the same time concurring together; made these things come to effect, which would be otherwise incredible.</p>
            <p>Was it not a strange case to see the Athenians and Lacedemonians, who had so long time sought for the superioritie; to come themselues into the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection of the Macedonians, who before was tributarie to the Illyrians? And the Citie of Thebes, which had sometimes aspired to that principalitie, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, rased, and distroied in one day; and the Citizens thereof sold as slaues, and brought into bondage? On the other side, there was not then any man excellent in knowledge, but indured much. SOCRATES the father both of moral and politike Philosophie, falsely accused of not beleeuing in the Gods, &amp; of corrupting youth, was condemned and executed by poyson: But his condemnation being found vniust, the people repented it soone after; considering how great a personage they had wrongfully put to death; and were so mutinous against them which were the cause thereof: that finally they put them all to death also; without hearing their defences and allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. PLATO was sold by pyrats: and in danger of his life in the Court of Syracusa. XENOPHON was banished Athens. ARISTOTLE constrained to depart, fearing least they would deale with him, as they did with Socrates. DEMOSTHENES poisoned himselfe with the poison which he caried in his ring: because he would not yeeld himselfe to the mercie of his enemie Antipater. DEMETRIVS the Phalerian, retired himselfe to the king of Alexandria, where he died of the byting of an Aspe. EVRIPIDES into Macedonia, where he was deuoured by mastifes.

Aristotle in the first of his Politicks, alleageth the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:13829:70"/>
Poets which said, that the Greekes should rule ouer the Barbarians: as if a Barbarian were the same by nature that a seruant is. And Demosthenes in his third Olynthiack; that it was fit, that the Barbarians should be subiect to the Grecians.</p>
               <p>Plutarch saith, that Alexander did not as Aristotle his Master counsailed him; which was, that he should show himselfe to the Greekes as a father; and behaue himselfe towards the Barbarians as a Lord: And that he should haue care of the one, as of his friends and kinsfolkes; and serue himselfe of the others as of plants, or of beasts: which if he had done, he had filled his Empire with banishments; which are alwaies secret seeds of warres, and factions: and verie dangerous partialities. But he accounting that he was sent from Heauen, as a common reformer, gouernour, and reconciler of the world; those whom he could not bring in by perswasions of reason, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained them by force of armes; and assembled the whole world of many estates into one; and mingling together the liues, maners, mariages, and kinds of liuing; he commaunded all men liuing, to account the habitable earth their Countrie; and his Campe to be the castle, and dongeon: all the good folkes to be of kin one to the other; and the euill, and wicked onely to be straungers: And moreouer, that the Greeke and the Barbarian should no more be distinguished by their cloake, nor by the fashion of their target, nor by the high hat; but should be marked and discerned; the Greeke by vertue, and the Barbarian by vice: reputing all the vertuous to be Greekes, and all the vicious Barbarians: accounting moreouer the garments common; the tables common; as also the mariages, and maners of liuing; being all vnited by the mixtion of bloud; and communion of children. Strabo in the first of his Colmographie is of the same opinion, that this difference ought rather to be made by vertue and vice; because there were many Greekes wicked and euill; and many Barbarians good and ciuil: as the Romains, and Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians, who gouerned very well their common weales. Plato in his Epino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mides affirmeth, that the Greekes inhabited a Region most apt of all others for vertue; and that the praise thereof consisteth chiefely in this, that it is in a meane, betweene heat and cold. Whereunto Aristotle agreeth, saying in the seuenth of his Politicks, that the Greeke nation is both couragious, and ingenious; as inhabiting in a meane, betweene the North and the South: which made it to perseuer in libertie; and to be well gouerned: and that it might commaund the whole world, if it had but one gouernment. We will compare it then vnto the former: and first of all in power; then afterwards in learning: and other excellencie, in many arts, and workmanships.</p>

Philip the sonne of Amyntas; shall find it a long time: during which, they fought more amongst themselues for ambition of rule, one ouer the other, then they did against straungers to augment their Empire, and to preserue their libertie. And some of them for couetousnes of getting a new Lordship in Sicile, ouerthrew themselues; some others which went into Asia to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, got no great thing there; but returned soone againe. And in deed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the power of the Greekes hath bin trauailed in many great warres, yet did it neuer firmely establish any Empire out of Greece. The Grecians for a time were mightie enough, and made proofe of their forces for keeping of their libertie; and to shew themselues inuincible. But in the time of the said Philip, and his sonne Alexander, their estate and affaires began to decline. Before the deeds of the Macedonians were little esteemed; and they were subiect alwaies for the most part to other nations. And although Philip by his trauailes and labours magnified them greatly: notwithstanding his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie neuer went out of the countrie of Greece. Touching the Empire of Alexander it is most certain that it was glorious and excellent, both for the greatnes thereof, as also for the celeritie of his conquests: But after it was once come to an infinite degree, and impossible to imitate; it diuided it selfe soone into many parts: Euen as a flash of lightning which giueth sodainly a great light, and runneth hither and thither, and then is extinguished. But if the great God (saith Plutarch) which sent the soule of Alexander here below, had not sodainly called it vnto him againe; peraduenture there had bin but one only law, which had gouerned all men; and all this world had bin ruled vnder one selfesame Iustice: euen as by one light.

He was more religious then Diomedes, who was readie to fight with the Gods them selues; and he accounted, that all his victories and happie successes, came vnto him by fauour of the Gods. He was more charitable to his parents then Vlisses, whose mother died for sorrow: whereas the mother of his enemie for loue and good will which shee bore vnto him, died with him for griefe of his death. Solon ordained at Athens an abolishment of all debts; Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander paied his souldiers debts to their creditors. Pericles hauing taxed the Greekes, of the money which came of this taxe, beautified the Citie of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens with faire Temples, especially the castle: on the contrarie, Alexander hauing taken the treasure of the Barbarians; sent into Greece the summe of six Millions of gold, to build temples for the Gods, in steed of those which they had ouerthrowen. Brasidas got great reputation of valiancie amongst the Grecians, because he trauersed, and passed thorough the enemies host, from thone end to the other, being incamped before the Towne of <hi>Methona</hi> along the sea shore: whereas the meruailous leape which Alexander made in the Citie of the <hi>Oxydraques,</hi> to those which heare it told, is incredible, and to those which saw it, most terrible; when he threw himselfe from the height of the walles into the midst of his enemies, who receiued him with darts, and arrowes, pikes, and swords: Whereunto might one compare this deede, but vnto the flash of lightning, which breaketh forceably out of the cloude, and being caried by the wind, striketh on the earth: euen as an apparition shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out of flaming armour. Insomuch, that those which saw him at the instant, were so frighted therewith, that they retired back: but when they saw that it was one man alone, assailing a great many; then they returned to

make head against him. That which led Alexander against all Nations, was nothing but a desire of glorie, and of rule, hauing proposed vnto himselfe by iealousie and emulation, to surpasse the deedes of Bacchus, and of Hercules; by making his armes to be seen yet farther then they had made theirs. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, it was a great happines vnto him, and such as neuer hapned to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Monarke; to haue in his time the most excellent men in all knowledge, and the best worke men that euer were; towards whom he was verie liberal: as also to them it was a great aduantage to haue such a beholder, who knew most ingeniously to iudge of that which they had done; and to recompence it most liberally. For euen as the humanitie, the honour and liberalitie of the Prince, is that which prouoketh and setteth forward the aduancement of arts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of good inuentions: so on the contrarie, all that languisheth, and is extinguished, by the enuie, and nigardnes of those that rule.

He gaue charge vnto Aristotle, to reduce into wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, the natures of all liuing creatures; and for this effect caused to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered to him eight hundred Talents; comming to CCCClxxx. thousand Crownes of our money: commaunding many thousands of men thorough out Greece, and Asia, as hunters, fowlers, fauconers, fishers; and all those which had charge of parkes, pooles, or birdhouses, to bring him beasts and liuing creatures; or to make faithfull report of their natures. He gaue to the Philosopher Anaxarchus to set vp his Schoole, a hundred talents; and to Xenocrates, a man of great account, fiftie. He did singularly admire the Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie of Homer, which he had alwaies at night vnder his beds-head with his dagger; and accounted much of philosophie, wherein he had bin instructed by the said Aristotle: esteeming no lesse to surmount others in the knowledge of good, and excellent arts, then in power and force of armes. Wherefore he desired aboue all, that his deedes might be recommended to posteritie, by worthy writers: as in like maner he would not be pourtraied but by Apelles; neither haue his statue made but by Lysippus: which were two the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent workmen, that Greece euer bare; thone of them a Painter; and the other a Statuarie.

               <p>PLato in his Timaeus saith, that the Countrie of Greece, by reason of the temperature of all the seasons of the yeare did bring forth wisemen; and in the fourth of his Common wealth; that the Grecians, by the situation of their countrie, were naturally giuen to the studie of wisdom: attributing in his Menexemus this propertie principally to the territorie of Athens, which he vpholdeth to be most apt for the breeding of good arts; as in trueth there haue bin more Grecians, and namely Athenians learned, and eloquent, then of all the other Nations of Europe. Yet so is it, that the same au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour in his Epinomides acknowledgeth, that the sciences came first from the Barbarians to the Grecians, but that they amended and bettered whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they receiued of others. And Solon in the beginning of the said Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeus confesseth, that the Grecians vnderstood nothing of antiquitie, in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the Egiptians. And affirmeth, that by one of their Priestes it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched vnto him: that the Grecians were alwaies children: that there was none in Greece that was old: in as much as they were all yong of vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; without hauing any opinion taken from antiquitie, nor any hoarie and aged science.</p>
               <p>Iosephus against Appion the Grammarian, meaning to shew that we ought not amongst the Greeks to seek for the knowledge of antiquitie; but amongst the Egiptians, and Chaldees, whose Priests were carefull to write histories: saith, that he meruaileth at those which attributed all to the Greekes, therin; it being most certain, that the Greecians came into the world, not onely after it was come to his full groweth, but euen when it was waxing old; and that all their inuentions, maners, lawes, arts, townes, and cities are but new. Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus affirmeth, that Diuination and Geometrie, were brought out of Egipt into Greece: and that the Greekes learned of the Babylonians the eleuation of the Pole, the vse of the quadrant, and the diuision of the day into howers. Moreouer, that the Egiptians found out the diuision of the yeare, &amp; diuided it into twelue Monethes, by the knowledge which they had of the starres; where in it seemeth to him, that they behaued themselues better then the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians: for asmuch as the Greekes, to place the time that was super-abundant, were constrained from three yeares to three, to put betweene them an odd moneth: And on the contrarie, the Egiptians allowed thirtie daies to euery moneth, adioining to each yeare fiue daies, ouer and aboue; in such sort, that the reuolution of the time, came alwaies to one point, and was found good. Herodotus also writeth in his fifth booke, that the Phenicians which came with Cadmus to inhabite Beotia, brought with them many arts &amp; learnings, planting there the knowledge of letters; which the Greekes had not before: And confesseth, that all the Phenicians vsed them before the Grecians; but that sithence by succession of time, the sound of the said letters was changed together with the words. The learned men which went out of Greece into
<pb facs="tcp:13829:73"/>
Egipt, to learne their Lawes and sciences, were Orpheus, Musaeus, Mélam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus, Homer, Lycurgus; and after them, Solon, Plato, Pythagoras, Eudoxus, Democritus, and Inopis, which learned in Egipt, all that made them worthy of admiration. For Orpheus brought therehence the hymnes of the Gods; the festiuals; the punishments, and rewards of the dead; &amp; the vse of statues. In like maner, Licurgus, Plato, and Solon, brought to their common weales, many lawes and constitutions; which they had taken from the Egiptians.

The Egiptians en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoured to proue, that the Athenians were discended of a Colony of Scytes, a people of the countrie of Egipt; as is told in the Timaeus of Plato; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed by Diodorus the Sicilian: because that in the townes of Greece, the people was diuided into three parts, according to the custome of Egipt. For the first order of the citie was of the nobles, who being giuen aboue all others to the sciences, were the more esteemed; being therein like to the Priests of Egipt. The second was of those to whom lands had bin diuided, and assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to thend they might the better giue themselues to armes, for defence of their Countrie; like vnto those of Egipt, who were inuested with fees; and which did wage the souldiers for the warres, at their charges. The third or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was of the meaner sort of people, and of Artisans, who being giuen alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to Mechanicall arts, furnished many necessarie workes for the whole Communaltie.</p>

               <p>THe Artisans of Greece were no lesse excellent in their workes, then the learned in their professions; and many of them did write of their miste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: of whom the most famous in diuers arts haue bin before recited. Neuertheles, Herodotus in his second booke, speaking of the Labyrinth of Egipt, and of the Pyramides, saith: that if any one would make comparison, of the buildings, fortresses, &amp; works, which were then in Greece, he should find that they were all of lesse labour and expence, then this labyrinth. And albeit the Temple of Ephesus; and that of Samos, deserued to be reckoned of: yet the Pyramides exceeded tongue, and pen: considering that one of them was equall to all the buildings of the Greekes; and yet notwithstanding, the Labyrinth surmounted the Pyramides. But that the artificial poole of Meris, neer vnto which it was seated, yelded yet greater meruails. Moreouer Diodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus the Sicilian affirmeth, that the best cutters, &amp; caruers of Images that were
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:13829:74"/>
in Greece, learned their measures and dimensions of the Egyptians: who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst al other nations did not measure the composition of statues by the eie; but did them by compas: to thend that the statue might be made of many and diuers stones gathered into one body; obseruing the measures &amp; proportions. A thing in deed worthy of admiration: namely, that many Artisans in diuers places, should so well agree in one measure; that one onely Image entier, and perfect, should be made by them being separated one from another; somtimes of twenty, somtimes of forty stones.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E will now come to the ROMAINS; who in their time obtained the excellence in armes, in learning, and in all workmanships: But euen as after the going of Xerxes into Greece (which put the Grecians in the greatest feare that euer they were) the war hauing had an other end then was expected, they not onely found themselues out of danger, but also got great glory thereby; growing meruailously from that time forward in all felicity, riches, and excellency of all arts: So the Romains after the second Punick warr, and voiage of Hani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal into Italy; which troubled them much, remayning there sixteene yeres with a mighty army, in which time he wan many battails on them, and came euen to the gates of Rome, where he might also haue entered, if he had kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen how to vse the victory: the Romains then being brought to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test extremity, that euer they were (being vanquished by the Carthaginians, and seeming to haue giuen ouer the glory of armes vnto them) yet this long, and cruel war hauing taken an other end then was looked for; and the chance being tourned to the aduantage, and honour of the Romains; by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy, and good counsaile: from that time forward for the space of three and fiftye yeres (as Polybius saieth) they became exceeding strong both by land and by sea, commaunding not onely ouer all Italy, but also ouer the better part of the world; stretching their Empire to the rest of Europe, into Asia, and into Africke; which they made greater then any other that had bin
<pb facs="tcp:13829:75"/>
before, or hath bin after them: increasing in all felicity &amp; aboundance; which togither with idlenes, made the Arts and sciences to come in reputation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them: as it had before in Greece. For after they had vanquished, and ouerthrowen the Carthaginians, destroied Numantia, and razed Corinth to the ground; reduced into prouinces, the kingdomes of Macedonia, Bythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, Suria, Pontus, Capadocia, Numidia, Mauritania, and Egypt: conquered the Spaynes, and the Gaules: subdued Germanie, and great Britaine; obtained the Lordship of the sea, and Isles thereof: there was not found any more suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient power to resist them, then that of the Parthians on the East; which seemed to haue parted with them the Empire of the world, possessing seuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene kingdomes. In so much that sithence that time, both military, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticke discipline, was better in Italy then it had bin before in any part of the worlde.

waxed olde; and seemed as if in short time it woulde decay and come to nought: as by order of nature it falleth out with all other thinges. Horace witnesseth that in his time the Romains were come to the height of fortune; and that they did all workes better then the Grecians. Seneca writeth that all whatsoeuer Italy may oppose or prefer vnto Greece, flourished about the time of Cicero: and that all good wits which haue giuen light to Latin let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were borne then. Solinus speaking of Augustus, saith that his raigne hath bin almost the onely time wherein armes haue ceased; and good wits, and sciences florished.</p>
            <p>To such authority, magnificence, &amp; state came the Romain Empire; whose beginning in deed was small and difficult, but yet miraculous: as promising some greatnes in time to come. And first the generation, birth, and education of Romulus (who by beginning the buildings of the city of Rome laide the first foundation of this estate) was meruailous. For it is said that his mother lay with the God Mars; and it was then beleeued, that Hercules, was engendred in a long night, the day hauing bin withheld, and the sun staied co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the course of nature; so was it also beleeued that in the conception of Romulus the sun was eclipsed: and that there was a true coniunction of the Sun with the moone; when Mars (who was a God according to the Pagan credulity) coupled with Syluia being a mortal woman; and that the same happened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to Romulus the same day that he departed this life, vanishing out of sight when the sunne was in eclypse. And then when he and his brother Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus were borne, Amulius (who had constrained their mother to make her selfe a votarie or Nun, and to vow perpetuall chastity, shutting her vp with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the wood of Mars, where she became with child) seeing that they were two, and meaning to make them die, commaunded they should be exposed, and cast forth; and their mother shut vp close: whereof she died. But fortune (which a far off beheld the birth of so great a city) prouided for the two chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; by means of a kind and gentle seruant, who hauing charge to cast them out, would not put them to death: but laid them on the bank of a riuer, ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to a faire green meadowe, and shadowed with little trees neere vnto a wilde figgtree: and then a shee-wolfe, which had lately brought forth young ones and had lost them, hauing her teats so full of milke that she was readie to burst, seeking to ease herselfe came to these children, and gaue them sucke; as if she had brought foorth a second time, in being deliuered of her milke. And then the bird which is consecrated to Mars called a hickway or wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecker comming thither, and approching to them, amd with her foote, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening gently the childrens mouthes one after another; fed them with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle crommes of her owne food: which being perceiued by the shephearde Faustulus, he caried them there hence, and brought them vp poorely among his beasts; no man knowing who they were; neither that they were the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Syluia, and nephewes to Numitor, and to the king Amulius. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after this maner brought vp amongest the shephards, they became strong and hardy: in such sorte that oft times they defended their beasts from being
<pb facs="tcp:13829:76"/>
taken of thee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es. It fell out that after they had many times done so, Remus was taken, and accused vnto the king of theft, from which he had often kept others; and that it was he which set vpon the beastes of Numitor. And then was he deliuered by the king vnto Numitor to take auengement of him; or to be recompensed by him for the robberies which he had done: who see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the yong yeres of Remus; and considering well the markes of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; togither with the time, when his daughters children were cast out; began to suspect that he was one of them, by his age so well agreeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. And being in this doubt Romulus and Faustulus came vnto him; by whom he was aduertised of the trueth of all. Then being auenged of Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius (whom they slew) they placed Numitor in the kingdom; and afterwards founded the citie of Rome. ROMVLVS then the first Prince, authour, and founder thereof, hauing composed it of Countrey people, and nea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards, had many trauailes in doing thereof; and found himselfe intangled with many wars, and many daungers: being constrained to fight with those that opposed themselues to the rising and foundation of this City; and to the increase of this people newly planted. Then afterwards as his natiuity, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation, and nourishment had bin maruailous; his end was no lesse. For as he spake vnto the people, sodainly the weather was ouer cast, and the aire was horribly chaunged; The sunne lost entierly his light, and there were terrible thunders, impetuous winds, stormes and tempests on euery side, which made the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon people to hide themselues here and there in corners: But the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours kept themselues togither. Then when the storme was past, the day clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and the weather become faire, the people assembled againe as before; and went to seeke their king, and to aske what was become of him. But the Lords would not suffer them to enquire any farther; but admonished them to honour, and reuerence him, as one that had bin taken vp into heauen; and who thence forward insteed of a good king, would be a propicious, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable God vnto them. Moreouer Iulius Proculus, one of the Patricians accounted a very honest man, (who also had bin a great familiar friende of Romulus) affirmed that as he came from Alba he met him on his way; grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and fairer then euer he had seen him; armed all in white armour, bright, &amp; shyning as fire: and that being afrighted to see him in such sort, he asked him wherefore he had abandoned his orphane city in such infinite sorowe: To who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Romulus answered; <hi>It pleased the Gods, from who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I came, that I should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main among men, as long as I haue remained, &amp; that after I had built a city (which in glory, and greatnes of Empire, shall one day be the chiefe in the world) I shoulde returne to dwell in heauen, as before. Wherefore be of good cheere, and say vnto the Romains, that in exercising of prowes, and temperance, they shall attaine to the height of humaine power: and as for me I will be henceforth a God, Protector, and Patron of them whom they shall call</hi> QVIRINVS.</p>
            <p>The auncients recited many such meruailes, in the which there is no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parance of trueth, endeuouring to deifie the nature of man; and to associate him, with the Gods. It is is very true saith Plutarch, that it were euil, and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:13829:76"/>
wickedly done to deny the diuinity of vertue; but yet to mingle earth with heauen were great foolishnes: being a thing most certaine, that after death the soule (which is the ymage of eternity) remaineth only aliue, and retour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to heauen wherhence it came; not with the body; but rather when it is farthest remoued, and seperated from the body; and when it is cleane and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and holdeth nothing any longer oft he flesh. Therefore it is not necessary to go about to sende against nature, the bodies of vertuous men with their soules vnto heauen: but we ought to thinke, and firmely beleeue that their vertues and soules, according to nature and diuine Iustice, become saincts of men; and of saints demy-Gods: and of demy-gods (after they are perfectly as in sacrifices of purgation cleansed, &amp; purified, being deliuered of al passibility, and mortality) they become (not by any ciuile ordinance, but in trueth, reason &amp; liklyhood) entier &amp; perfect Gods; receiuing a most happy &amp; glorious end.</p>
            <p>But NVMA the second king, succeeding vnto Romulus, had time and leasure to establish Rome, and to ensure the increase thereof, by meanes of the long peace which hee had with all his enemies; which was to Rome as a store-house of all munition for the wars which folowed after: and the people of Rome hauing exercised themselues at leasure, and in quiet and rest, by the space of xliij. yeres, after the wars which they had vnder Romulus; they made themselues strong enough, &amp; sufficient to make head against those which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards opposed themselues against them. Considering that in all that time, there was neither plague, nor famine, nor barrennes of the earth, nor intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratenes of winter or sommer that offended them: as if all these yeres had bin gouerned not by humane wisdome, but by the diuine prouidence. For he gaue out that the goddesse <hi>Egeria</hi> was in loue with him; &amp; that lying with him, she taught him how to rule and gouerne his common wealth. Numa then taking the city of Rome, as in a turbulent tempest, and in a sea tormented, &amp; troubled with the enmity, enuy, and euil wil of all the neighbor nations, and bordering peoples; and moreouer exercised in it selfe with infinite troubles, and partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; he extinquished and asswaged all angers, and all the enuies, as euil, and contrary windes: giuing meanes to the people being but newly planted, and scarcely yet established, to take roote and to fasten their footing, by augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting leasurely in al safety; without wars, without sicknes, without peril, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare, or any other hinderance whatsoeuer. For in all his raigne there was neither war, nor ciuil sedition, nor attempt of nouelty, in gouernment of the common wealth; &amp; yet lesse enmity or enuy perticularly against him; or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy against his person forgreedines of rule. And not only at Rome was the people softned, &amp; reformed after the example of the Iustice, clemency &amp; good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the king; but in all the Citie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> also round about, began a meruailous change of maners no otherwise then if it had bin a sweete breath of some wholsome and gracious winde, that had breathed on them from the side of Rome, to refresh them and there stole sweetly into the harts of men, a desire to liue in peace, to labour the earth and to bring vp their children, in rest and tranquility, and to serue and honour the Gods.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13829:77"/>After these two raigned fiue kings at Rome: and in TARQVIN the last, for hate of his pride, and not of the royall authority was the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment chaunged: Rome being from that time foorth gouerned by two annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all CONSVLS, and by the SENATE vnder the authoritie of the people.</p>
            <p>Then from the Consuls it came to the rule of TEN MEN, from whom it retourned back againe to the CONSVLS. And whereas there were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed vnto them two military TRIBVNES of equall power: they were within the yere deposed, and gaue place to the CONSVLS. And albeit they vsed in the great affaires of the common wealth to create a DICTA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TOVR with absolute authority for the time; neuerthelesse the Consula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry administration remained still; and vnder it Rome prospered most; aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting meruailously in power, till it came to the Empire of the world. And it seemeth discoursing by reason on the augmentation therof, that it was gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and gouerned by the diuine Conduct: and that the true God (though he were not knowen nor worshipped of them;) because of their iustice, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, valiance, and good discipline, exalted them: to the end to represse, or to chastise the great, and exceeding vices raigning at that time, amongst ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny nations? It was hee that fauoured them continually, by land, by sea, in war, and in peace; against the Italians, against the Greekes, against all stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Barbarians; giuing them meanes to ioine trophees to trophees; tryumphes vnto tryumphes; and conquest vnto conquest; of kingdoms sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, nations ouercome; Islandes and Continents brought vnder sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection: which came all vnder the shadowe of the greatnes of this Empire. He permitted that by one onely battaile Philip of Macedony should be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That by one onely blow Antiochus should yeld them Asia; That the Carthaginians by one only ouerthrow should lose Lybia; That POM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PEY at one aduenture, and one onely voyage should conquer them Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, the kingdome of Pontus, Syria, Arabia, the Albanians, the Iberians; and euen to the hill Caucasus, and to the Hircanians; and to the Ocean which enuironeth the world; which at three seuerall times, and three diuers places saw him victorious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he should represse, and beate backe the Nomades in Africk, euen to the bankes of the meridional Ocean; that he should subdue Spaine, which was reuolted with Sertorius, euen to the Atlantick sea: and should pursue the Kings of the Albanians, euen to the Caspian sea.

God I say caused Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal, to run and consume out of Carthage into Italie, euen as an impetuous raging streame; permitting that by the enuy, and malignity of his enuious fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low citizens, no reenforcement nor succour shoulde bee sent him from his countrey. He permitted that the armies of the Cymbrians, and of the Teutons
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:13829:77"/>
should be separated by great distance of places, and times; to thend that MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIVS might be able to fight with them, and to ouerthrowe them both one after another: and to hinder that CCC. thousand fighting men should not ioyne togither at the same time to ouerrun all Italy with inuinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men, and forces vnresistable. He permitted that Antiochus should hold him still, whiles they had wars with Phillip; and that Phillip hauing bin already beaten, should dye when Antiochus was in danger of the losse of his estate. He permitted that the Bastarnick, and Sarmatick wars should hold the king Mithridates occupied, whiles the Marsick warre burned, and foraged Italy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That Tigranes, whiles Mithridates, was strong and mighty, should di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust, and enuy him; which kept him from ioyning with him: and afterwards when he was ouerthrowen, should gather vnto him, that he might also pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish with him. He permitted that the Romains after the great discomfiture which they had receaued of the Gaules neer to the riuer of Allia, should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite themselues; and that the said Gaules beseeging the Capitoll, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing surprized it by night should bee discouered by geese: without which warning, both the place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the estate, had bin lost. He permitted that Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander the great should die before he came toward the west: who being ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uated by many great victories and glorious conquests, began already to darte the flaming beames of his armes euen into Italy. In such forte that all these hinderances being taken away by the diuine permission, the Romains had meanes to growe; and with time to establishe an Empire of greater com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe both by land and by sea, then any whereof there is any memory; and at whose incomparable power Plutarch admiring in the raigne of Traian, thought, vertue and fortune (which ordinarily doe neuer agree togither) had with one accord accomplished, the greatest and goodliest worke, that eu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Fabians, Scipioes, Metelles; and those of his time, or somewhat afore him, as Sylla, Marius, the two Luculles; and Pompey himselfe, whome Plinie dareth to compare, not onely with Alexander the great, but with Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, and Bacchus; recounting the victories happely obtained by him in all partes of the worlde, with his titles and tryumphes: Hee shall finde that the deedes of Caesar, in all military vertue, and precedence in matter of warre, surmount them all entierly: the one in the vneasinesse of the places where he made his Conquests; the other in the largenesse and circuit of those countries, which hee added to the Romain Empire; another in the multitude and strength of the enemies whom he defeated; another in the roughnesse and sharpenesse of men with whom he had to deale; whose manners hee afterwardes polished, and softened; The other in clemency towardes those whome hee had taken; another in liberality, and great benefice towardes those which fought vnder his charge in the warres: and all of them in the number of battailes which hee wan; and multitude of enemies which he slew in battaile. For in lesse then in ten yeares (which the warres of the Gaules endured) hee tooke by assault or by force eight hundred Townes; subdued three hundred nations; and hauing had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times in battaile before him three Millions of armed men; he slew one Million of them, and tooke as many prisoners. Moreouer he made himselfe so well beloued of his people, who were so earnestly affectioned to doe him seruice, that albeit they were but as other men when they fought for any other; yet when the question was of the honour or glory of Caesar, they were inuincible, and ran headlong on all daunger with such furye, that none was able to abide them. And being borne to do all great things, and his hart being by nature desirous of great honour, the prosperities of his passed prowesses, and conquestes, did not inuite him to be desirous to enioy in peace the fruict of his labours: but rather kindeled him, and encouraged him, to bee willing to vndertake others, engendring alwaies more and more, an ymagination in him of greater enterprises and a desire of newe glory; as if that which he had already had bin wasted and worne out. Which passion was nothing else but a iealousie and emulation of himselfe, as if hee had bin some other man; and an obstinate desire al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to ouercome himselfe: the hope of that which was to come fighting still with the glory of what was passed; and the ambition of that which hee desired to doe, with that which hee had all ready done. For hee had purposed, and already made preparation to goe fight against the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, and after he had subdued them, to passe thorough Hircania, and to enuiron the Caspian sea, and the mountaine Caucasus; and returning to win the kingdome of Pontus, that hee might afterwarde go into Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia, and hauing ouerrun, all the Countrey and bordering prouinces of great Germany, and Germanie it selfe, to retourne in the end thorough Gaule into Italy, and so to spread the Romaine Empire round about: in such fort that it
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:13829:78"/>
should on eche side be bounded with the great Ocean. That great fortune, and fauour of heauen, that had accompanied him all his life long, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the auengement of his death; pursuing by land, and by sea, all those which had conspired against him: insomuch that there remained not one vnpunished of all those, which either in deed or in counsaile, were parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the conspiracy of his death. But of all things which haue happened to men on earth, the most wonderful, was that of Cassius; who after he had bin defeated, &amp; lost the day in the battaile of Philippi, slue himselfe with that very sword, wherewith he had stricken Caesar. And of those which happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in heauen the great comet which appeared, was euident for seuen nights continually after his death: and shortly after also the darkening of the light of the Sunne, the which in sight of all that army arose alwaies pale; and neuer with his sparkling and shyning brightnesse; whereby his heate was also very feeble, annd weake; and the aire consequently all the yeare long very darke, and thicke by reason of the imbecillitie of the heate which could not resolue, and clarifie it: which was the cause that the fruictes on the earth remayned vnripe and vnperfect, perishing before they were rypened, by reason of the coldnes of the aire. But aboue all, the vision which appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Brutus, shewed euidently that the slaughter was not acceptable to the Gods. Suetonius also witnesseth that at <hi>Capua</hi> was found in the sepulcher of <hi>Capys</hi> a Tablet of brasse, signifying the death of Iulius; the maner howe he shoulde die, and be slaine: which sepulcher, and tablet had bin made a thousand yeres before. The people sorowed much for him after his death; because he was most skilfull and experienced how to rule: and caused his body to be brought into the midst of the market place; building a Temple for him neere vnto the place where hee was buried, and worshipped him as a God.</p>
            <p>OCTAVIAN his nephew, and successour, had such hap, that of a simple Citizen, or Knight of Rome, hee obtained the Empire of the whole worlde; which hee ruled about fiftie and sixe yeares; being whiles heeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and after his death honoured as a God: by consecrating of Temples vnto him, erecting of statues, and ordayning of Priestes with great foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations to doe seruice there. Before he was borne, it was foretolde by Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Marathus vnto the Senate and people of Rome, that nature shortly would bring them forth a King. And P. Nigidius a very learned Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Philosopher, hauing knowen his natiuity, affirmed that there was a Lorde of the worlde borne. Which Cicero foresawe in a dreame; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vnto him that the children of the Senatours were called vnto the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitoll; because Iupiter had appointed to shewe which was he, that should one day bee head and Prince of Rome. And that all the Romaines of a great desire which they had to know who he should be, were all come round about the Temple; and that all the children were likewise attending there in their purple garments: vntill that sodainly the gates of the Temple were opened, and then the children arose one after another, and passed along
<pb facs="tcp:13829:79"/>
before the statue of Iupiter; who looked vpon them all sauing the young Caesar, to whom when he passed before him, hee reached out his hand, and said, <hi>Ye Romaine Lordes, this child here is he, that shall make an end of your ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill warres when he commeth to be your head.</hi> It is said that Cicero had this vision while he slept; and that he imprinted firmely in his memory the forme of the childs countenance; but that he knew him not: And that on the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row he went of purpose into the field of Mars, whither, the yong folke were wont to goe to play and sport themselues; where he found that the child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren hauing ended their exercises, were retourning home-ward: and that amongest them the first which he perceiued, was he whom he had seen in his dreame, and he remembred his fauour well. Whereof being yet more asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, he asked him whose child he was; who aunswered that he was the sonne of one Octauian; a man not much renowmed, and of Actia, the sister of Iulius Caesar: which Iulius Caesar hauing no children made him by testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his heire, leauing him his goods, and his house. It is told of him that soone after he began to speake being not farre from the citie in a house of his fathers, where the froggs did nothing but crie and trouble men with their noise, he commaunded them to cease, and be still; which they did, and neuer afterwards were heard in that place. He was a gentle, gracious, and ciuil per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage, proper, comely, and faire throughout all his body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But especially his eyes; which shined as faire starres when hee moued them. In such sort that they which looked on him, winked as at the sun-beames: And when a certaine Souldiour tourning away from his face, was asked why he did so; hee aunswered because hee coulde not abide the shyning of his eyes: and wee doe yet doubt that there bee from aboue certaine personages ordained to rule and commaund ouer mankinde, and to do great, and strange maruailes.</p>
            <p>But IVLIVS CESAR hauing ouercome his Citizens, made himselfe the first Monarck of the Romain empire: to whom Augustus succeeded, who gouerned it most happely after he was absolute Lorde thereof. In such sort that there is not found any time wherein it hath bin so wealthy, and well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and established in peace, and obedience as it was in his time. And according to the forme of gouernment, which he brought into the state of his house, the traine of his Court, into the Senate, or counsaile, the course of Iustice, managing of his reuenewes, administration of prouinces, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of forces both by sea, and by land, that Empire long maintained it selfe, and prospered meruailously therewith. Being then in his greatest glorie, and power, hee held first of all in the Brittaine Ocean manye partes; and on the other side from the pillars of Hercules, all the Islandes and Portes, peoples and Nations which are in this Sea, as farre as it is nauigable, on the one side, and the other. Of which Nations the first on the right hande, are Mauritanians bordering on the Sea; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Countrey of Lybia, euen as farre as Carthage: After them hygher, and farther of the Numidians, and the Countrey of Numidia;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:13829:79"/>
and beyond them all the rest of Lybia, which stretcheth out vnto the Syrtes; togither with the City of Cyrene. Then are the Marmarides, the Ammoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and those which hold the marish of Marienna; &amp; consequently the great citie of Alexandria; togither with all the whole countrey of Egypt euen to the easterly Ethiopia: and going downe along the riuer of Nile by Pelusium vnto the sea. And after retourning along the banke thereof, the countrey of Suria, Palestina; and yet higher, a part of Arabia, and the Phenicians; and farther into the land the Cilisyrians bordering on the riuer Euphrates. Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the sea, the Palmyrians amongest sandie deserts which are on the said riuer of Euphrates; And yet farther the Cilicians neighbours to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Cappadocians with a part of Armenia, the lesser: Moreouer all the nations dwelling neer the sea Euxinus all along the coast. In regard of mediterranean, or vpland countreys towards Armenia the great; the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains ruled not ouer them, neither imposed any tribute on them: but gaue and confirmed their kings vnto them. Therehence comming from Cappado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia: &amp; euen to the Ionian sea is the great Chersonesus, in the which are on the right hand the prouinces, and nations of Pontus, and Propontida, of Helles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pont, and the Egean sea: On the left hand, the sea of Pamphylia, and of Egypt. And beyond those the Pamphilians, Lycians, Phenicians, and Carians euen to Ionia; Moreouer the Galathians, Bythinians, Phrygians, and Mysians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aboue the Pontick sea; and farther into the maine land, the Pysidians and Lydians: al which nations were subiect to the Romains. And passing yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Hellespont, they ruled ouer the Mysians dwelling in Europe: and the Thracians on the sea Euxinus. Neer vnto the countrey of Ionia, there is the gulfe of the Egean sea; and that of the Ionian; then the sea of Cilicia, and the Tyrrhen sea, reaching euen to the pillers of Hercules: within which reach, which is from Ionia, vnto the Ocean sea, there are many nations and prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which were subiect to the Romains: that is to say, the whole countrey of Greece, Thessaly, Macedony, and all the other quarters belonging to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince of Thrace; the Illyrians, Peonians, and the territory of Italy; which is for the most part enuironed with the Ionian, &amp; Tyrrhene seas; and stretcheth it selfe by land vnto the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey of the Gaules, hauing on the one side the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean or midland sea; on another the northern Ocean; and on thother the riuer of Rhene: and yet farder is all the countrey of Spaine, all along the Atlantick sea, euen to the pillars of Hercules. In regarde of those which are farther into land; they passed not into that part of Africk which hath on the one side the west Ethiopia; &amp; on thother the desert countrey of Lybia: which is not inhabited for the exceeding heate, and hath nothing but monsters, and wild beasts, vnto the East Ethiopia. These were the limits of the Romain Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire on the side of Ethiopia, and of Africk. On the side of Asia the riuer Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates, the mountaine Caucasus, the beginning of Armenia the great, and the Cholches dwelling neer the sea Euxinus, &amp; the rest of the Euxine sea. On the side of Europe the riuers of Rheine, and of Danubius: wherof the one that is the Rhene entreth into the Ocean; the other into the Euxin sea. And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
<pb facs="tcp:13829:80"/>
the Romains also ruled ouer some nations dwelling aboue the Rhene; and ouer the Gethes which dwelled beyond Danubius; and were called Dacians. Touching the Isles: all those which are within the mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean sea, which are called Cyclades, Sporades, Hyades, Echinades, Tyrthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides; or others whatsoeuer they are, about Lybia, Ionia, Egypt, or elswhere on the sea, which the Greeks call the great Islands; as Cypres, Candie, Rhods, Lesbos, Euboe, Sicilia, Sardignia, Corsica, Maiorca, Minorca; and all other great or little were subiect to the Empire of Rome: And on the coast of the northren sea, they held vnder their obedience, the greatest, and the best part of the Isle of Britayne.</p>
            <p>So many nations, &amp; prouinces did they subdue vnto their obedience, by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of discipline, good counsail, strength, courage, vertue, pacience, and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance of the Italians; when they taught to fight with the best military disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline in the world; which they vsed in rising, incamping, marching, &amp; figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, wel armed &amp; ordered; resolute to ouercome, or to die. Especially the footmen; in which they had more confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, then in their horsemen; fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding their principal strength on then. Then for the maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of their Empire, &amp; safety; they had 200000. men ordinarily intertained; xl. thousand horse, CCC. Elephants apt for war; two thousand Chariots furnished; and ouer and besids iij. hundred thousand harnesse of prouision: which is for their force on land.</p>
            <p>Touching that on the sea, they had about two thousand ships; a thousand and fiue hundred galleis, of fiue, and sixe oares, with furniture according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; eight hundred great Vessels for pompe, and to cary their Emperours guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and richly wrought, both at the forecastle and sterne: an inestimable quantity of gold, and siluer in treasure; hauing almost an infinite reuenew, consisting in yerely rents, in customes, and subsidies; and in tributes which we call taxes, and tallages: which they leuied, on so many Countries, lands, and Seigniories. Of which reuenew it is not possible to make any certaine estimate, or account; no more then of other Empires and kingdomes abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute: wherof the reuenewes increase or diminish, according to the dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their affaires; and will of the Soueraigne Lords, imposing and taking away subsidie at their pleasures.</p>
            <p>Such was the excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy of the Romains in arms. Touching that of <hi>Learning,</hi> CICERO without controuersie deserueth to be the first named amongst them: who giuing himselfe to ymitation of the Grecians; hath represented in his writings the vehemency of Demosthenes, the abundance of Plato, and good grace of Isocrates: hee not onely got by studye that which was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in eche of them; but of him selfe also hath produced many vertues, or rather all, by the most happy felicitye of his immortall vnderstanding; borne by some guift of the diuine prouidence, to the end that Eloquence in him might showe all her forces. For who coulde teache more dily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, or moue more earnestly; who was euer more pleasant? in such sort that one woulde thinke that he obtained that which he intreateth by force. And albeit by his vehemencie he transporteth the Iudge; yet seemeth he
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:13829:80"/>
not to be drawne himselfe: but to followe of his owne accorde. Moreouer, there is such authority in whatsoeuer he saith, that it seemeth a shame to gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say him; not bringing with him the diligence of an aduocate, but the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of a witnes, or of a Iudge: all these things notwithstanding flowing from him without constraint or labour; amongst the which each of them stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing particularly, yet with great difficultie excelleth each other. And there appeareth in his speach a happie facilitie, goodly to heare. Wherfore he was not without cause accounted by those of his time to raigne in iudgements; and hath gotten amongst posteritie the name, not of a man; but of eloquence. Plinie giueth such testimonie of him. But what errour were it for me (saith he) to omit thee M. Tullie, or what excellent praise shall I giue thee? but euen that which hath bin bestowed on thee, by the common voice, and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall suffrage of all the people of this nation: in taking out of all thy life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the works onely of thy Consulship? when you spake, the Tribunes refused the law Agrarie: that is to say, their foode and sustenance. When you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded; they pardoned Roseius<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the authour of the law Theatral. When you perored and pleaded; it was permitted vnto the children of banished persons to seeke for honours, and magistracies. Catiline flyeth from thy wisdome; Thou hast proscribed and banished Mark Anthony: I salute thee the first that hath bin called the father of the Countrie; the first that hath deserued in a gowne, the triumph of the Crowne of lawrell, by speaking well; parent of the Latine language, and elegancie: and (as Cesar the Dictator was wont to say of thee) hauing the prerogatiue of all triumphes: for asmuch as it is more to haue aduaunced the bounds of the Romain learning, then of the Empire.</p>
            <p>The same Plinie writeth thus of M. VARRO. The statue of him alone whiles he liued, was placed by Asinius Pollio, in the librarie, which he first of all others erected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the spoiles gotten of the enemies; which I esteeme no lesse glorie, proceeding of a principall Oratour and Citizen, in that mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of good witts that then was; and giuing this crowne to him alone: then when Pompey the great, gaue him the nauale Crowne, for hauing wel behaued himselfe in the warre against the pirates, where he was his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. Cicero dedicating to him his first Academick, saith: Thou hast decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the age of the Countrie, the descriptions of time; the rights of holy things, and of Priests; the discipline of peace, and of warre; the situation of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and places; the names, kinds, offices, and causes of all, both diuine and humane affaires; bringing great light to our Poets, and generally to Latine words, and letters: and hast in many places begun Philosophie enough to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken men, though little to teach them. And in his second Philippick; M. Varro (saith he) would that this place should be the house of his studies: what matters were handeled therein, and what written? The rights of the people of Rome, the monuments of the auncestours, the reason and doctrine of all wisdome. And writing vnto him in his Epistles, he saith: I haue alwayes esteemed you a great personage, especially that in these troubles are almost alone in quiet; and receiue the fruites of learning,
<pb facs="tcp:13829:81"/>
which are great; considering and treating of things, the vtilitie and delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof ought to be preferred before all the actions, and pleasures of theis others: Surely I account this abode, which you make at Tusculum to be the true life; and would willingly leaue all riches to all men; that it might be permitted me without any hinderance, to liue after this maner. Lactantius dareth to affirme, that there was neuer any more learned amongst the Greeks and Latins. S. Augustine calleth him the sharpest of all men, and without doubt the most learned: who hath read so many things, that it is a wonder he had any leasure to write of ought; and yet hath written so much, that it is scarce credible, that any one could read it all: for he wrote CCCCXC. books. Also, who hath more curiously searched out this then Marcus Varro; or more learnedly found it; or more attentiuely considered it; or more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly distinguished it; or written more diligently and fully of it? who albeit he be not so sweete in speach; aboundeth notwithstanding aswell in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and sentences; as in all doctrine, which we call secular; and they libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall: he can aswell teach the studious of things, as Cicero delight the curious of words.</p>
            <p>Cicero, in his booke of the world, giueth such testimonie of P. NIGI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DIVS. This personage was adorned with all liberall arts; and a diligent searcher of things which were hidden, and folded vp in nature. And I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thus of him, that after the noble Pythagorians, whose discipline was in a maner extinct: hauing florished many yeares, in Italie and Sicilie, he hath renewed it.</p>
            <p>The same Cicero saith of SERVIVS SVLPITIVS a Lawier: his admirable, incredible, and almost diuine knowledge in exposition of the lawes, and declaration of right and equitie, shall not be forgotten. If all those which euer in this Citie had vnderstanding of the Lawes, were assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together in one place; yet were they not comparable to Seruius Sulpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius: for he was not so well seen in law, as in Iustice; wherefore he referred alwaies to facilitie and equitie, the deeds proceeding of the rule of right, and of the Ciuile Law: And did not take so much paines to set downe the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and pleadings of causes; as to take away the doubts of matters and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of controuersies.</p>
            <p>The same Cicero of GALLVS AQVILIVS, an other Lawier; I say one could not to much esteeme the aucthoritie of such a man; whose wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome the people of Rome hath knowen, in taking heed to himselfe; and not in deceauing of others. Who did neuer seuer the reason of Law from Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; who so many yeares hath readily imployed his wit, labour, and fidelitie for the good of the people of Rome: who is so iust, and so good, that he see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be a Lawier by nature, and not by discipline; so learned and prudent, that he seemeth to be not onely a naturall knowledge; but also a certain good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the ciuile Law: whose vnderstanding is so good, and such his fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; that whatsoeuer is drawen from thence, is found to be pure and cleere.</p>
            <p>Before this time the Latine Poesie was rude, which was then polished, and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:13829:81"/>
brought to perfection, especially by VERGIL; whom Quintilian witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, among all the Heroicke poets, both Greeks and Latins, to haue come neerest vnto Homer: in whom notwithstanding he acknowledgeth, that there was more of nature. These are the most notable personages that flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed then both in armes, and learning.</p>
            <p>But IESVS CHRIST defaced all their excellencie; who in the raign of Augustus, discending out of Heauen here on earth, and clothing himselfe with the shape of a man, was borne of the Virgin, and came forth of her wombe, both visible Man, and God inuisible; promised by the Law, and the Prophets; the master of trueth, and cleanser of Idolatrie; correctour of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and renewer of our depraued nature: to thend, to restore such as belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in him to their auncient puritie, and innocencie; corrupted by the forfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the first man. He gaue sight to the blind; speach to the dumbe; straight going to the lame; healed incurable diseases; cast out euill spirits; fedd with fiue loaues, and two fishes, fiue thousand persons; turned water into wine; went safely on the waters, as on the land; commaunded the sea, the winds, and the tempests; raised the dead to life; and liued himselfe againe, after he had bin wrongfully crucified, and killed by the Iewes. By which miracles he shewed himselfe to be the sonne of God: establishing his Church and christian Religion; in steed of the Mosaical, and Pagan. Which hath alreadie endured more then fifteene hundred yeares, and shall neuer haue end; hath passed alreadie to the Antipodes; and hath bin manifested to the East and West Indians; yea, euen amongst the sauages lately discouered towards the South, which before were vnknowen to all antiquitie: and among the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest people of the North, by meanes of the Sueuians, and Moscouites. In somuch, that at this day we may affirme, that his word hath bin heard in all parts of the habitable earth; as he had ordained vnto his Disciples, enduing them with the grace of the holy Spirite, and power, to do miracles, as he had done before, and with the gift of tongues; with perseuerance, pacience, and constancie, against all torments and persecutions. A thing indeed admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; and the like whereof neuer hapned to any King, Law-maker, or Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher, Grecian, or Barbarian: who contented themselues to set downe, and cause to be receiued in their countrie, and language, the institutions and Lawes, which they esteemed good and profitable. But Iesus Christ, not as a mortall man; seruing himselfe with poore fishermen for his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: (whom he would haue from that time forward to bee fishers of men) hath manifested his Gospell by them thorough out the whole world; and before all people: inioyning them to shew from him, the true way of saluation; and of beleeuing in GOD the Creatour of all thinges. Such was the progresse and aduauncement, which they made in their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie; that in a little time they induced the Nations by their preaching, to leaue their auncient idolatries, and to receiue Christ as GOD: they established schooles, and auditories of the Christian doctrine: and then were Temples buylt to the Apostles, and Martyrs, in the most famous
<pb facs="tcp:13829:82"/>
Cities of the world; at Rome, Alexandria, and Antioche; thorough out Egipt, and Lybia, Europe, and Asia. Beginning then, when the Romain power was come to his soueraign greatnes, and glorie, vnder Augustus the peaceable ruler of innumerable Nations; when the kingdom of Egipt was extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, which had endured almost time out of mind; and the nation of the Iewes, brought vnder bondage and subdued; and the Lordships of the Syri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Cappadocians, Macedonians, Bythinians, Grecians, Illyrians, Africans, Spaniards, and Gaules, were vnder the Romaine Seigniorie: which we must think did so fall out, by the diuine prouidence of God, to the end to make the same worke the more easie; which otherwise must needes haue bin verie difficult: if all these Nations had remained in diuision and discord. But by meanes of the vnion of them vnder one great Monarchie, they accomplished with lesse feare and danger their proposed enterprise: God preparing them their way, and brideling the harts of the superstitious, by the terrour of that most mightie Empire. Cornelius Tacitus writeth, that such had bin the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of men, that it was contained in the auncient learning of the Priests, that about this time the East should preuaile; and that such as came out of Iewrie should raigne: which was verified in the spirituall raigne of Iesus Christ; whose Ghospell, doctrine, and religion, hath bin preached thorough out the world.</p>
            <p>God then seeing malice infinitely increased, and the worshipping of false Gods dispersed thorough all the whole world: in such sort, that his name was alreadie almost out of the memorie of men; and that the Iewes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues (to whom onely his diuine mysteries had bin reuealed, and promises made of his holy alliance) giuen ouer to vaine superstitions; hauing left the true Religion; whereunto they refused to returne, being reprehended, and admonished by the Prophets: at this time ordained for the redemption, he sent his sonne, the Prince of the Angells vnto men, to thend to diuert them from wicked and vaine worships; and to induce them to know, and to reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence the true God; bringing back their soules from folie vnto wisdom, from iniquitie to iustice, and from impietie to a right beleefe. Such and so notable at this time was the mutation both in gouernment, and in Religion.</p>
            <p>BVT as the Romains were climed to the top of humane power and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, by labour &amp; industrie: so were they straightwaies corrupted by riches, and ouermuch libertie; degenerating from the former integritie, prowesse, learning, and eloquence: Whereof I can not render any better reason then by their owne authours; men of good credit, and aucthoritie. To thend (saith Seneca) that ye may vnderstand, how much the witts of men do euery day decay; and by I know not what iniquitie of nature, and procliuitie vnto vice, eloquence is gon backe: All whatsoeuer the Romain eloquence hath to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose vnto proud Greece, it florished in the time of Cicero; All the good wits which brought any light vnto our studies, were borne then. Sithence that time it hath alwaies impaired: either by the loosenes of the time, which is most pernitious vnto good wits; or that the reward which was proposed for
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:13829:82"/>
so goodly a thing being lost, all the trauaile and paines hath bin bestowed on dishonest exercises; or els by some destinie, whose enuious law is perpetuall ouer all things; so that being come to the highest, they returne to the lowest, faster then they went vp. The good wits of slouthfull youth doe languish, and do not applie themselues to any honest exercise. Slouth, and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and dexteritie in things that are pernitious (which is worse then either sleepe or negligence) haue possessed their mindes. The delight of singing and dauncing holdeth the effeminate, and of dressing their haire, and fitting their speach vnto womanish daliances; and exceeding of women in corporal delicacies, and tricking themselues with vncleane cleanlynes: which is the brauerie of our youth. Who is there among the yong folkes ingenious, or stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious enough, or rather man enough? Being softned and effeminated; they remaine of necessitie as when they were first borne; corrupting the chastitie of others, and negligent of their owne. The Gods will not suffer so much euill, as that eloquence should come to such people: which I would neuer so much admire; if she did not make choise of the minds on which she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed her selfe. Cornelius Tacitus writing of famous Oratours saith: Tell me the cause why we are so farre from the former eloquence: since it is but six score yeares from the death of Cicero to this present. And a little after; who knoweth not that eloquence, and the other arts are fallen from their auncient glorie, not for want of men; but by the slouthfulnes of youth, and negligence of parents, and ignorance of teachers, and forgetfulnes of the auncient customes, Which euils being first begun in the Citie; haue bin eft soones dispersed thorough Italie: and all the prouinces. The elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent men of this time commit foule, and shamefull faults in euery woord of their ordinarie speach shutting vp eloquence into little sence, and smal sentences, as if she were banished from her kingdome: Whereas in times past, being richly deckt with all arts, she filled the breasts; now being clipt; and curtailed, she remaineth without ornament, without honour; and as if she were without ingenuitie; and is learned but as some base discipline. This we account to be the chiefe, and principall cause, why we are so far gon backe from eloquence. And the same author againe in the xvij. of his Annales saith: Before, the affaires of the people of Rome, were written with like eloquence, &amp; libertie; but sithence the battaile of Actium that the benefit of peace required all things to be reduced vnder the power of one; then ceased these great witts, and the trueth was vtterly lost: first by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the state of the common wealth, which was strange vnto them; then by flatterie, or hatred of those that ruled. Plinie in his second booke; I mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile (saith he) that the world disagreeing, and being diuided into king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, that is to say, into parts, so many persons haue imploied themselues to search out things which are so difficult to find: In such sort, that at this day euery one in his countrie knoweth some thinges more truely by the bookes of such as were neuer there, then by aduertisement of the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries. And now that we inioy so happie a peace, and haue an Emperour
<pb facs="tcp:13829:83"/>
that taketh so great pleasure in the sciences, and in new inuentions; men are so far off from inuenting any new thing, that they scarce learne the inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the auncients. The rewards were not then bestowed in greater abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance by the greatnes of fortune; and yet more men imployed themselues in searching out of these things, not expecting any other reward then to help their posterie. But mens maners are waxen old, and not the rewards. And the sea being open on all sides, and safe landing in all coasts, many do nauigate; but it is to gaine, and not to learne: whiles the mind being blinded, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether giuen ouer to auarice, doth not consider that it may more surely and safely be done by learning. The same Authour saith in his thirteenth booke; As the world is communicated by the maiestie of the Romaine Empire; who would not think the life of man accomodated by the intercourse of things; and by the societie of a happie peace? And yet notwithstanding, there are found but few which know that which the auncients haue left: So much the greater was their studie, and their industrie more fertile. About a thousand yeares past, shortly on the beginning of Letters; Hesiodus gaue precepts vnto husbandmen; who hath bin followed of many, which hath increased hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandrie amongst vs: for as much as it is good to consider, not onely that which hath bin sithence inuented; but also that which the auncients inuented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; the memorie whereof is lost by our sluggishnes: whereof we can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage no other causes, then those that are publick of the whole world. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, other customes are come in sithence; and mens witts are busied about other exercises: They are onely giuen to questuarie, and gainfull arts. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Empires of nations were shut vp in themselues, and therefore were they constrained by the necessitie of fortune, to exercise the gifts of the mind. Innumerable Kings were honoured by the Arts; and preuailed by them, thinking by them to obtaine, aide, and immortalitie: wherefore both the rewards and works abounded. The inlargment of the world, and plentie of things, hath bin hurtfull to posteritie. Sithence the Senatour began to be chosen by his reuenew; the Iudge to be made by the reuenew; and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hath so much commended the Magistrate and Captain, as his reuenew: Since that corrupting bribes were authorized, &amp; the purchase of offices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came very gainful; &amp; that the only pleasure was in possessing much: the prises of life are vanished; and the arts called liberall, of the great benefit of libertie haue fallen out to the contrarie: and men haue begun to profit onely by serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and slauerie; some worshipping of it in one sort, and some in an other: yet all notwithstanding, aspiring to the same hope of profiting. The chiefest haue rather respected the vices of another, then their owne vertues. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pleasure hath begun to liue; and life is perished. And the same in his xxv. booke; I can not sufficiently admire the diligence of the auncients, who haue left nothing vnsearched, and vnexperimented; not retayning to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, that which they knew to be profitable to posteritie: on the contrarie, we indeuour to hide, and to suppresse their labours; &amp; to depriue those good things of life, which are gotten by others. So certainly do they hide it, which
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:13829:83"/>
know any thing; being enuious of others: And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eaching it vnto none, do think thereby to authorize their knowledge. So far are these maners from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenting any new thing, wherwith to be helpful to life: the chiefest and soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine labour of good wits being come vnto this; to reserue to themselues the deeds of others, and to let them perish.</p>
            <p>Which is not to say, that there haue not bin sithence any learned, and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent men: but that they are much differing from the former in proprietie, puritie, facilitie, and elegancie of speach; not comparable to them in vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, iudgement, and knowledge. As in Italie, Seneca called by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour Claudius, sand without lyme, and a besome vnbound: The two Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; the Vnkle accounted the most learned of his time; and the Nephew a famous Oratour; who were men of great credit, and authoritie.

About the same time the <hi>Mathematickes</hi> arose vnto their soueraigne excellencie; by the industrie of Claudius Ptolomeus a <hi>Mathematician</hi> of incomparable know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and the best that euer was in this profession, who hath surpassed all the auncient Egiptians, Chaldeans, Persians, and Grecians; and hath not had his like sithence: hauing expounded more diligently then any other, the whole discription of heauen, of the earth, and of the sea, correcting the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the former, and their instruments; and declared the whole, with verie likely arguments, and euident demonstrations.</p>
            <p>The Romains for a time were verie good, both in peace and in warre, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest, iust, and valiant: especially after the warres which they had against the Tarentines, and the king Pyrrhus, vntill the third Punick warre. There was not then amongst them any dissention of the Nobles, or commotion of the
<pb facs="tcp:13829:84"/>
people. All there care was to augment, and increase their Empire, without respect of their particular profit. At what time there florished in the common wealth, Curius, Fabricius, Coruncanus, Metellus, Fabius, Scipio, Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, Paulus, and Lepidus: whose magnanimitie, and prudence in warre; and moderation in peace was admirable. Then the common wealth was verie good and holy; for asmuch as pouertie and sparing were then in estimation: and the three kinds of gouernment, were found there so equally ordained, and established so conueniently; that one could not say whether the state were an Aristocratie, or a Democratie, or a Monarchie. The power of the Consuls was manifestly monarchical and royal; that of the Senatours Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratical; and the popular estate wholy Democratical: And there was such an agreement, and band between them against all fortune, that one could not any where find a better estate of a common wealth. For if any common feare came from abroad, and forced them to succour one an other, then the power of this common wealth was so great, and such, that they wanted nothing for their defence; and they applied themselues all both in publike and priuate, to execute in due season their deliberated enterprises: In such sort, that they were sometimes reputed inuincible. On the contrarie, if being deliuered from the publike feare of strangers, they became insolent by domestical peace, and abundance of goods; &amp; accustomed themselues to idlenes, and delights; and that by this means, the one part would be Masters ouer the others, &amp; rule beyond reason: They had so well prouided a remedie for it, by the mutuall bridle and hinderance, which they were one to another, that no one could break out of rank, or lift vp himselfe aboue the rest: but were euery one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to remain in his charge. But after that by labour and iustice, they were increased; &amp; had ouercome the cruel. Nations, and mightie kings: They were eft soones corrupted, peruerting the order wherin they liued before; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming proud, and auaricious; exceeding in gluttonie, and whordom; and dissolute in al superfluities &amp; delicacies. And then they were diuided into par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialities, and factions; by occasion wherof they caried armes &amp; weapons into the temples, &amp; publik assemblies: killing sometime the Tribunes; somtime the Consuls; and other principal persons of the city. Wherhence ther arose disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest quarrels &amp; without order: &amp; therhence followed the contempt of lawes and of iudgments. And reenforcing the euil day by day, they began to plot ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest enterprises against the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth: &amp; to bring the great armies force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably into the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth, which were gathered of fugitiue, &amp; condemned persons. And although by their saying, they did it but against their aduersaries; neuertheles, in very trueth it was against the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth: because they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaded the city as enemies, &amp; cruelly killed such as they met; or persecuted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with banishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, &amp; abominable proscriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, not omitting any detestable deed</p>
            <p>Which seditions began by the two Gracches, Saturnin, and Drusus, furious Tribunes; then were diuers times renewed between Sylla and Marius; Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey and Cesar; and continued by Mark Antonie, Octauian, and Lepidus, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>assius, and Brutus: and finally being raised againe betweene M. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonie, and Octauian, who were brothers in law, caused the change of the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:13829:84"/>
common wealth into a Monarchie; the stoutest amongst the Romains being either slaine in battailes, or by proscriptions: and the others, being wearied with the ciuile warres, and greeued with the gouernment of the Senate, and of the people; thorough the dissention of the Lords, and auarice of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates. For as this age nourished most excellent persons in all vertue, and knowledge: so did it also bring forth more vicious then any time before; and authours of execrable mischiefes.</p>
            <p>The age of Cato (saith Seneca) brought forth many worthy to be borne in Cato his time: as there were then as wicked as euer were; and vndertakers of the greatest mischiefes. It was requisite that there should be of the one, and the other: To thend that Cato might be knowen, it behoued there should be some good men to approue and allow of him; and some euill, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst whom he might proue his force, and vertue. The same Seneca, saith: No age hath bin without blame; and if one consider the libertie of euery age, I am ashamed to tell it: but men neuer sinned more openly, then afore Cato. The same Authour; M. Cicero (saith he) betwixt the Catilines and Clodians; betweene the Pompeyes, and the Crasses; whiles he is tossed vp and downe with the common wealth; and the gouernment failing, he was caried away; and perished therewith. Cicero writing of Pompey, and of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar; Thone and thother (saith he) hath sought to make himselfe Lord, and not to make the Citie happie, and honest; and Pompey neuer left the towne till he could no longer keepe it; nor abandoned Italie till he was driuen out of it: but he thought at the beginning to moue all lands and seas; to stir vp the Barbarian kings; to draw into Italie the cruell nations armed. Do you not think there might be some agreement made betweene them? yes, now it might be done; but neither thone, nor thother hath this end, to make vs hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie: They would both of them raigne. And the same Authour; Certainly both the one and thother is miserable; who haue alwaies had lesse regard, to the safetie and dignitie of their Countrie; then to their owne domination and priuate commodities: And in the same place; whose alliance, and fidelitie in wicked agreement, you see what mischiefe it hath brought forth. The same Cicero saith, that Cesar was by nature and inclination cruell; but that he counterfaited clemencie, because that vertue seemed popular. And Seneca; Neither vertue nor reason (saith he) perswaded Pompey to vndertake either foreine, or ciuile warres: but being caried away with a foolish desire of his owne greatnes, he caried armes now into Spaine against Sertorius; now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Pyrates, vnder colour of pacifying the sea: He pretended these cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, to thend he might continue his power. What led him into Africk, and into the North against Mithridates; and into Armenia; and against all the kings of Asia; but onely an infinite desire of increasing in greatnes, seeming only to himselfe, that he was not great enough? What did put Iulius so far forward into these publike euils? glorie, and ambition, and a desire which he had without measure to excell aboue others. He could not suffer one to be before him; where the common wealth endured two. What? think you that Marius
<pb facs="tcp:13829:85"/>
being once Consul indeed, hauing taken away by force the six other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulships, when he defeated the Theutons, and the Cymbrians; and when he pursued Iugurtha, thorough the deserts of Africa; did aduenture these dangers by the instinct of vertue? These men mouing all things, were also moued themselues; after the maner of whirle-winds, which carrie away whatsoeuer they catch: and thereby become more impetuous, and can not be stil. Hauing then bin mischieuous vnto many, they finally feele in themselues their pernicious mischiefe; whereby they haue bin hurtfull vnto many. The same Seneca; It is all one (saith he) whether Cato ouercome, or be ouercome in the battaile of Pharsalia. The good being in him which could not be van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished when his partie was ouercome, was equall with the good which he should haue caried victorious into his Countrie; &amp; haue pacified the affairs. Wherefore should it not be equall? seeing that by the same vertue euill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune is ouercome, and good fortune well ordered. The vertue can not be greater nor lesser; It is alwaies after one sort. But Pompey shal lose his armie; but the honest pretence of the common wealth, and the Senate, with the chiefest Lords of Rome, following the part of Pompey, being placed in the first rank of the battaile, shall be ouerthrowen in one onely battaile; and the ruines of so great an Empire shall be dispersed ouer all the world: one part shall fall into Egipt, an other into Africk, an other into Spaine. This mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable common wealth can not all fall at one time; Let them do all they can. The knowledge of the places doth not help the king Iuba in his kingdom; nor the obstinate vertue of his subiects: and the fidelitie of the Vticians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broken with so many euils faileth. And should Scipio be abandoned in Africk, of the fortune of his name? It was already prouided that Cato should receiue no harme: And yet he was ouercome. Certainly the calamities were verie great in that conuersion of the world; and there were strange aduersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties mingled with the prosperities. There was neither Countrie, Citie, Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, or personage any whit renowmed; but endured much. The ruine of Carthage first presenteth it selfe, which Citie seuen hundred yeares after it was founded, had bin so flourishing, and excellent in all things; had borne rule ouer so many seas, and lands, and Islands, and ships; and so much riches; and so many armes, as n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ne more: and had courage more then any other. Fourteene yeares after, the Numantines being besieged by Scipio AEmilian, seeing that for want of victuals they were not able any longer to endure the siege, themselues burned thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Citie of Numantia; and killed themselues, part by the sword; part by fire; &amp; part by poison. Cicero nameth Carthage and Numantia, the two astonishments of the people of Rome. Shal I tel how Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racusa was spoiled; Corinth rased; Antioch, and Hierusalem taken; Athens besieged and sacked; Mars<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>illes borne in triumph? how Rome saw her Senate flying; &amp; her treasures taken away? Alexandria found Cesar fighting in her; and her king the yong Ptolomey dead? how Thebes in Egipt was destroied; Thirteen towns in Peloponesus swalowed vp with an earthquak, wherwith Caria &amp; Rhodes also were shaken? How ther came extraordinary inundations
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:13829:85"/>
of the sea; of riuers and of raines; of tempestuous winds? Monsters hideous in all nature, signes in the aire, comets, eclipses of the sun, and of the moone; and other horrible things in the celestiall motions: whereof ensued famins, plagues, and other diseases, which were before vnknowen. Cicero writeth, that there appeared then, not onely fierie impressions by night in the heauen, flashes of of lightning, and tremblings of the earth: but moreouer, that the thunder fell on the high towers of the Temples; many Images of the Gods were remoued out of their places; many statues of famous men throwen downe; the tables of brasse, wherein the Lawes were ingrauen, were melted. The Image also of Romulus the founder of Rome, (who was made as he were sucking, and waiting at the tears of the wolfe) striken with thunder. Shall I tell of fower-score thousand Romains, and their allies, defeated by the Cymbrians; and a hundred fortie thousand Cymbrians slaine by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains? the armies of the Heluetians, and Germains ouerthrowen? the bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men vp in armes, and allies mutining? And not onely the good townes, and mightie armies did suffer, but also the rich seignories, and noble kingdomes were distroied: the free nations either trauailed with warres, or were brought vnder subiection. As the Spanish, French, British, Germain, Pannonian, Illyrian, Armenian, and Thracian. Italie it selfe, after it had about some fiue hundred yeares valiantly defended it selfe, was in the end subdued. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, there were scarce any famous men, either in armes or learning, but either receiued notable iniuries; or suffered violent death. Scipio Africanus being returned out of the Senate, was found the next day stifled in his bed: which was thought to haue bin done by his neerest kinred. Hannibal being driuen out of Italie, and banished Africa; poisoned himselfe in the Court of king Prusias. The king Mithridates being besieged by his sonne Pharnaces, slew himselfe; and Pharnaces was in a moment ouercome by Cesar. Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus the great was depriued of the greatest part of Asia; whereof he thanked the Romains. And the king Prusias cald himselfe their slaue. Perseus the last king of Macedonia was ouercome, led in triumphe, and died in captiuitie; and one of his sonnes was the scribe of the magistrates. Tigranes king of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia, prostrated himselfe before Pompey, and asking pardon, he lifted him vp; and put the Diademe on his head, which he had throwen downe. Ptole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mey king of Cypres, threw himselfe head-long into the sea; knowing that by the instance of Clodius the Tribune, Cato was sent thitherto carie away his treasures. Syphax, Iugurtha, and Iuba, being great kings in Africke, ended vnhappely.</p>
            <p>Sertorius was slaine by treason; Marius flying from Rome in extreme dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his life, hid himselfe in the marish about Minturnes, and went to sea in a squiffe without victuals, to the fortune of the windes, and the waues: afterwards being returned, he died, being three score and ten yeares olde, and almost mad. His sonne slew himselfe at Preneste. Sylla died eaten with wormes, and lyce. Crassus being ouercome beyond Euphrates by the Parthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, was slaine as he parlied on safeguard. Pompey was beheaded in the
<pb facs="tcp:13829:86"/>
shore of Alexandria. Cesar murdred in the senate-house. Cato, Brutus, Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius, &amp; Antonius, were slain by their owne hands. Cleopatra the last Queene of Alexandria, was strong to death with an Aspe. Cicero twice banished, and his head, and hand cut off, with which he had written his Philippicks. Mark Varro proscribed. Nigidius exiled. So many horrible things came to passe at that time, that the verie remembrance of them striketh feare and horrour into me.</p>

               <p>THE Romaines then (which for a time had meruailously profited) liuing in libertie, after that by the factions, into which they were fallen, they were brought into seruitude vnder the rule of one Monarch; they waxed worse and worse; by little and little decreasing the exercise of Armes, and studies of learning. And howbeit by the vertue of some good Princes, the Empire seemed in some sort to rise againe; yet was it the more brought low, and afflicted afterwards by the loosnes of others: the honour and venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble excellencie of this soueraine dignitie, being transferred from the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent families of Rome, to strangers of all nations: yea, euen to certaine base and vicious persons; who came to it by force, and by corruption: of whom the most part were slaine by the greedie souldiers which had created them; and others were ouerthrowen by themselues. Which disorders continued till such time, as the Empire fatally approching to his end; was abandoned for a pray to the barbarous Nations. For, these Emperours vnaduisedly think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to fortifie themselues by the mercenarie and auxiliarie armes of strangers, whom they sent for to their succour and seruice; weakning the proper and naturall forces of the Empire, which their auncestours had vsed in the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it: they drew, ere they were ware of it, many of the Northren nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into the countries, lands, and seigniories of their obedience. Moreouer, by transporting the principal forces, and riches, from Rome to Bizantium, diuiding of the Empire into the East and West; they weakned much. In such sort, that the West was first distroied, and then at length also the East; which remayning vnited, might haue long, and almost perpetually resisted all inuasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Then was lost the puritie and elegancie of the Latine tongue; the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians leauing to speak Latin: and in like maner the disciplines written therin came to contempt, and ignorance; and all liberall and Mechanicall arts were corrupted: as is easie to iudge by the workes of this time, yet remayning of diuers sorts. And although in this mingling, there fell out great things, and strange meruailes; yet met they not with men to gather them diligently, and to write them worthely: but they whole remained either buried in the darknesse of ignorance, or wrapped vp in confusion; or depraued by barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risme, which endured in Europe about a thousand yeares.</p>
               <p>But howbeit, that common weales haue their naturall conuersions, fatall
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:13829:86"/>
periods, and prefixed times of continuance: It seemeth notwithstanding that the chiefe cause of the ruine of the Romain Empire, ought to be attributed to CONSTANTINE surnamed the great; who transported the seate thereof out of Italy, where it was begon, and growen vp; chaunged the fourme of gouernement, in which it had bin maintained sithence Augustus time; casserd the Pretorian souldiours; made the fees hereditary, which the men of armes before possessed onely for a time, or during their life at most; created newe Magistrates; and ordained newe Lawes, altering in a little time all the auncient forme of gouernement. For, Dioclesian being dead, Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian, Maxencius, and Licinius slaine (who had bin all Emperours at the same time with Constantius associated by them) when this CONSTAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TINE (the sonne of this Constancius, and his successour in the Empire) sawe himselfe alone peaceable Monarch, he bethought him for the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuating of his memory, and celebrating of it the more, to build vpon the straight of the sea, and the farthest part of Europe next vnto Asia, in the place where Byzantium stood before, a great citie equall in all things vnto Rome; which he beautified with the same priuileges, liberties, dignities and honors: To the end that by the force thereof the Empire toward the East might bee vpheld against the Persians; whose power at that time was great, and terrri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; as in the west it was maintained against the Germains by the meanes of auncient Rome. He would that these two cities should be reputed as one; and that the citizens of thone as of the other, should in like maner be chosen Consuls; of whom thone should be resident here; and thother there. He or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained that there should be foure prefectures of the pretorie, or Courts of soueraigne authority, next vnto the imperiall; by which all the affaires of the Empire should be ordered: two for the west, of Italy, and of Fraunce; two for the East, of Ilyrian, and of the Orient. And in liew of the fifteene legions ordained by Augustus, and intertained by his successours for defence of the Empire on the Riuers of the Rhene, and of Danubius; he there built cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Castles, and Fortresses, putting in them but weake garrisons: yet think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neuerthelesse that they woulde bee strong enough to stop the courses of the Northren nations; which he tooke to be altogither ouercome by the great victories which he had obtained ouer them. Wherin he was greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued; for as much as these barbarous people seeing the frontiers of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire weake, and euill garded, stayed not long from winning them; entering into the prouinces of the Empire, which they ouerran and inuaded mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably: namely the Ostrogoths, and Lombardes of Italie; the Visigoths, Aquitaine and Spaine; the Frenchmen, and Burguignons, the countrey of Gaules; the Vandales, Bethicke, and Africke: Finally Rome, which was called before the head and light of the worlde, and subduer of countries, was besieged, taken, spoyled, and destroyed many times. Which euils (according to the saying of Ezechiel) came out of the North; which hath alwaies bin so fertile of men, that not onely it hath filled with inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitantes the wast wildernesses, and huge Forestes of that quarter; but also
<pb facs="tcp:13829:87"/>
hath accustomed to cast out innumerable people; which haue possessed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia, and Europe, ouerthrowing the auncient estates to establish new.</p>
               <p>But I retourne to the Empire which THEODOSIVS the first of that name held last entierly both in the East and West; &amp; afterwards deuided it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his two sonnes HONORIVS, and ARCADIVS: vnder whom began the foresaid afflictions, by the disloyalty and blinded ambition of Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finus, and Stilicon their gouernours. THEODOSIVS the second, son of Arcadius, was the last that may truely be called Emperour of the west, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till Charlemaigne. Whiles Martian, and Valentinian raigned, GENSE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RICVS the <hi>Vandale</hi> who had intelligence with ATTILA king of the <hi>Hunnes,</hi> made him come out of Pannonia into Gaulewith fiue hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men; where he was fought with by the Romains, Goths, and French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. It is not red that there were euer two greater armies any where oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed one against the other, nor which fought more obstinately; in such sort that there were slaine a hundred and fourescore thousand; and amongest o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Theodorick king of the Gothes. ATTILA being retourned into Pannonia after this ouerthrow, leuied a new armie; and came furiously into Italy, where he forced, sacked, and burned <hi>Aquileia,</hi> and many other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And as he purposed to goe to Rome the Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the first of that name came vnto him, and did so much by his intreatie that he not onely changed his purpose of going to Rome; but also leauing Italy he retourned into his owne countrey. He was a fatall Tyrant vnto Europe, and became in a little time very mighty; calling himselfe arrogantly the scourge of God: but his power was estsoones lost by the discord of his children.</p>
               <p>On the other side GENSERICVS, king of the <hi>Vandales</hi> went out of Spaine into Africk, where he made no lesse wast then Attila had done in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope: he tooke <hi>Carthage,</hi> and <hi>Hippona,</hi> of whence Saint Augustine was Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, who dyed there during the siege, lamenting the ruine of the Empire; and distruction of the Churches. Therhence he sailed into Italy with a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie army, and went vnto Rome, which hetooke, and spoiled: And being won by the praiers of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> (who before had appeased Attila) he did not put it to fire and sword. Whereby it appeareth that the Empire toward the west was very weake: which many Emperours of small renowmne held one after another; who dispatched one another by treasons, and secrete practises, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remaining long. Amongest whom there was a certaine AVGVSTV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LVS, who voluntarily quitted the Empire; and led a priuate life. His name seemeth to haue bin fatall, because that the Empire which began at AV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GVSTVS ended in him at Rome.</p>
               <p>At the same time ODOACER RVGIAN went with a great army of <hi>Herulois</hi> into Italy, where he obtained the gouernment. Against whome ZENON the Emperour sent <hi>Theodorick</hi> king of the Ostrogoths, who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercame him in two battailes; and in the end slew him, remaining Master of Italy: which he and his successours enioyed about threescore yeres, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hence the Emperor IVSTINIAN thrust them out entierly by the Eunuch
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:13829:87"/>
                  <hi>Narses,</hi> as he draue the Vandales out of Africk by <hi>Bellisarius.</hi> From that time forth the Greek, and Lombard HEXARCHES tore, and mangled Italy, till they were put downe by the Frenchmen, and that by the prowes, and feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of CHARLEMAIGNE, the peace was there restored.</p>
               <p>But by reason of these inuasions made by so many diuers nations one vpon an other; there came wonderfull mutations into the world; of tongues, buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, habits, customes, lawes, Magistrates, offices, maners of liuing, publick, and priuate, of the military discipline, of armes, engines, &amp; instruments: with their words and names. This notwithstanding, and although learning and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence diminished by little and little; there were many learned men both Greeks and Latins; such as the estate of that wretched and troublesometime could bring vp. Namely those which are called the doctours of the Church, as GRECIANS, Eusebius, Athanasius, Cyrillus, Gregorie Nazianzen, and Basil the great; being Bishops, both of them noble, and brought vp togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as fellow Scholers at Athens: Theodoret, Gregorie of Nicene, Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, Nectorius, &amp; Iohn Chrysostome Patriarches of Constantinople; Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linarius of Antioch, and Damascen all <hi>Thelogians</hi> or <hi>Diuines.</hi> Before whome were Clement of Alexandria, Iustin Martyr, Aristides, and Athenagoras: there florished moreouer Appian and Dydimus, <hi>Grammarians;</hi> Libanius a <hi>sophister.</hi> Plotinus Iamblichus, Maximus, Porphyrius, and Proclus <hi>Philosophers.</hi> Oriba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius, Paulus Egineta, &amp; Etius <hi>Physicians:</hi> Procopius, Agathias, Philostratus <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Symmachus was an <hi>Oratour,</hi> Boe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius a <hi>Philosopher,</hi> who was exercised in al parts of Philosophy, and in Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, so happy both in verse and prose; that it is hard to iudge whether he were the last that spake Latin, or the first that did vndertake to restore learning and eloquence decaied. Laurentius Valla calleth him the last of the learned men. For sithence we haue not had any but Saint Gregory, Beda, and Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardus Clareuallensis. In so much that learning remaineth as it were dead, the world going into a great silence, and ignorance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13829:88"/>The troubles also and varieties were no lesse in matter of religion then of Empire. For wheras sithence the resurrection of IESVS CHRIST those which made profession of his Gospell, had bin by the space of three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeres, cruelly persecuted with diuers sorts of horrible torments by the Emperours, Nero, Domitian, Traian, Seuerus, Maximinus, Decius, Valeria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Aurelian, Dioclesian, and Maximinian: Finally CONSTAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TINE embrasing our religion, vndertooke against his brother in law, Lici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Caesar for the protection thereof a great war, and more important then was that betweene Pompey and Caesar; or between Octauian, and Antony. In which the question was not onely of Empire, as in the other; but also of religion: namely, whether the world from that time forward should be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect and obedient to Christian Emperours, who would ouerthrow the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Gentils; or els vnto the Emperours of the Gentiles who would vtterly roote out Christianity: whereof ensued one of the chiefest mutations that euer was; CONSTANTINE thorough the grace of God remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning victorious: who caused the worshipping of false Gods to cease, &amp; shut vp their temples, and set the Christians in security; permitting them freely and publickly to pray vnto the true God, and to build Churches: vnto which he assigned reuenewes for the maintenance of Preachers and Ministers, and would haue them receaued vnto honours, and magistrácies notwithstanding their profession.</p>
               <p>This quarrel being scarse appeased, the heresie of <hi>Arrius</hi> arose, the most pernitious that euer was: for the rooting out of which, CONSTAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TINE assembled that famous counsaile of <hi>Nicene.</hi> But yet two yeres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death at the perswasion of his sister <hi>Constance,</hi> hereuoked <hi>Arrius</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine out of banishment. The which was cause of great scandal, especially betweene his sonnes the Emperours CONSTANS, and CONSTAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIVS: of whom the one was an <hi>Arrian,</hi> and the other an <hi>Orthodoxe</hi> or true Christian. Amongst whom thus disagreeing, there were counsailes held a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst counsailes, and the one disanulled by the other: confessions against con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions: creedes against creedes: two Bishops different in euery city; and dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble seruice in the churches, double mutining continually, accusations, defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, banishments, and martyrdomes. Which disorder endured a long time, this discord being spread far and wyde thoroughout the world, yea euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Gothes, Vandales, &amp; Lombards: who vnder this pretence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted execrable cruelties, and innumerable spoiles.</p>
               <p>On this scandal happened an other yet worse then the former. For IV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIAN their cosin, and successour, comming to the Empire, when Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiandome seemed cleane deliuered of <hi>Paganisme,</hi> he set it vp againe, denying the faith of IESVS CHRIST, whereby he got the surname of an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postata.</hi> He took away the reuenews graunted by <hi>Constantine,</hi> to the churches of the Christians; and forbad the schooles vnto children: depriuing both the teachers, and learners of their maintenance. He killed many that made profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of christian Religion; depriued others of their charges, as <hi>Iouinian; Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian,</hi>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:13829:88"/>
and <hi>Valens;</hi> tooke away their goods from others, saying in mockery that by making of them poore, he made it easier for them to go into paradice: because it was written in their bookes. <hi>Blessed is the poore, for vnto such belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the kingdome of heauen.</hi> He exhorted the Iewes to restore their maner of gouernement for hatred of the Christians; and to reedifie the Temple. Hee wrote bookes against the Christian doctrine which he said was repugnant to common sense; and did take away the bands of humaine society: but his furie passed as a cloude; for he raigned onely nineteene monethes, dying of a hurt in the war, which he made against the Persians. In whose place IOVINI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AN was chosen Emperour by the armie, who brought matters into a better state. The destruction of the <hi>Iudaick,</hi> and <hi>Delphick</hi> Temples happened at that time, which portending the ruine of both those religions, abated much the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solence of the Iewes, and of the Pagans; and assured, and comforted the good Christians.</p>
               <p>Afterwards the <hi>Gothes, Vandales, &amp; Lombardes,</hi> Arrianizing (as we haue said) afflicted Europe and Africk, almost two hundred yeres, &amp; ruinated the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the West. Which they that were reputed wise men amongst the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles seeing, said that this desolation proceeded of the changing of the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent religion, wherein the Empire had bin nourished, increased, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained long; and that the Gods being angrie sent such calamities, for reuenge of their contempt. Against whom S. Augustin opposed him selfe, writing his bookes of the city of God to refute them. On the other side, the Nestorians, Eutichyans, and Manichees, troubled all the East. The Persians destroyed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia, and Africk: their king <hi>Cosroe</hi> publishing an edict, that whosoeuer would saue his life, should renounce that God that was crucified. Then the Sarasens entierly exterminated the Persians with their language, and religion. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer the Emperours of Constantinople, beating downe the Images, and sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the temples, were excommunicated by the Popes of Rome: Who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad them thoroughout Italy to pay them any tribute, or to put their pictures in their coine, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded that their names should be omitted in their masses, and publick praiers; &amp; refused their edicts, commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts &amp; letters; making them to lose that which they had remaining in the west: &amp; to assure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues against them and aganst the Lombards, who had seazed on the Hexarchat of Rauenna, they sent for <hi>Charles Martel, &amp; Pepin,</hi> who were Frenchmen, &amp; of the house of <hi>Austrich</hi> to their succour: whose strength, authority, &amp; renowme at that time was great. And consequently they created, consecrated, &amp; crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned CHARLEMAIGN Emperor of the west; calling him <hi>Augustus, &amp; Cesar</hi> three hundred and twenty yeres after the Emperors were ceased in Italy. He deliuered Italy from the <hi>Lombards,</hi> Germainy from the <hi>Hongarians,</hi> &amp; Gaule of the <hi>Sarasens:</hi> with the victories which the grand-father and his Father wan of them. He went twice into Spaine; and ouercame the Saxons. And as he was learned in Greeke and Latin, being no lesse a fauourer of learning then a louer of armes, he ordained the Vniuersitie of Paris, which hath bin si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence the most famous of the worlde, and most florishing in all Artes:
<pb facs="tcp:13829:89"/>
hauing serued for a refuge for the studies of learning, which are waxen cold in Asia, vtterly lost in Greece, decaied in Italy, and driuen out of Egypt, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick. So this magnanimous, and victorious prince ioyning togither the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test prouinces of Europe, was a Monarch, protector of the peace, religion, lawes, iudgements and disciplines.</p>
               <p>By such occasion was the Empire restored to the west; which had first his seat in France; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Germany, where from hereditary it is become electiue; and in proces of yeres by euill ordering is so much diminished, and impoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished, that there remaineth nothing but the shadowe of a great name, and vaine title: The princes <hi>Electours</hi> holding the imperial lands with their rents, reuenewes, customes and commodities horded vp; and the principall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes being franchised by the Emperours, who haue giuen them priuileges to gouerne freely their common weales. Concerning Italy which was the chiefe and ancient patrimony of the empire; it is either possessed by the Popes which hold Rome that was wont to be the proper seat of the Emperors, and many other places; or by the kings of Naples, or by the Venitians, or by the dukes of Milayne, Florence, Ferrara, Mantua, Vrbin, and other potentates sequestred from the empire. The Isles of <hi>Sicilie, Sardigna, Corsica, Maiorca, Minorca,</hi> and <hi>Sauoye</hi> also are cut off. Thus hath the Empire by succession of time bin distracted, and dissipated: Sithence the ruine whereof the world hath not had his vertue so vnited. But many kingdoms are lifted vp ech in his countrey: as towards the west that of France, Spaine, and Portingale. In the North England, Denmarke, Sueden, Moscouy, Polonia, Hungaria. In the East Persia, Narsingue, China or Cathay. In the South that of the Soudan, of Presbiter-Iohn, Tuniz, and Fez; and elswhere many seigniories and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, which acknowledge none but themselues.</p>

meanes of which singularities, and prerogatiues they got in auncient time, the greatest Empire that euer was; and yet not of such largenesse that it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended the whole worlde: which neuer happened hitherto; neither is euer possible to come to passe. For on the North side they neuer ruled ouer all Germany and great Britaine; neither ouer Norway, Sweueland, Mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couia, Lituania, and Scythia; Neither towards the south ouer Ethiopia, and the higher Africk, where the Blackmores inhabite; neither in the East ouer India, China, Catay, Giapan, and Taprobana; which Easterly parte hath the riuer Tygris for a fatall bound; without speaking of the lands lately dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered in the West: in so much that looking considerately thereon, it wil bee founde by true reason of Cosmography, that they neuer possessed the twelfth part of the earth. ZENON the first authour of the secte of the Stoickes, ymagined an vniuersall forme of gouernement, tending to this, that all men should not liue by townes, peoples, and nations; being separated by particular lawes, rightes, and customes: but that they should account themselues fellow citizens; and that there was but one sorte of life, as there is but one world; no otherwise then as if it were but one flocke, feeding vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one shepheard, in common pastures. PLATO also wished that there were on earth but one king, as there is in heauen but one God; to thend that the humaine gouernement might therein resemble the diuine: which Lord of the world as a true shepheard of mankind, should loue al men indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as his naturall subiectes; maintayning them with good maners, lawes, iudgements, and assured entercourse both by sea, and lande: so great a prince not bearing enuy to any person; and hauing no occasion to enlarge his fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers by ambition: which would be the cause of ceasing so many enmities, warres, slaughters, spoiles, and robberies, happening amongst men through the pluralitie, and dissentions of gouernements. Which matters being by them grauely and magnificently propounded, are much more easie to bee wished then effected: considering the diuersity of tongues, dissimilitude of maners, and customes, varietie of sects, and vanity of opinions that raigne amongest men; and make them to lose that loue which is wished amongest them: hindering the establishing of one vniuersall common wealth of all; and consequently a Monarchie, of people so much differing in estimation of diuine and humaine right, and the religion and seruice of God. One man alone can not possesse all the earth, the greatest part of it being drowned by the sea; and in some places where it is vncouered of waters, being vnhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table thorough excessiue heate or cold: And if he should possesse it, hee would straight forget himselfe in so great authoritie and libertie; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come proud beyond measure, waxing tyrannicall and insupportable: as it happened to Cambyses, to Nero, to Sesostris, to Attila, to Tamberlan, and to Alexander the great; who thorough extreeme ouerweening would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted and called the sonne of God; and for his insolencie was poisoned by his most familiar friends: and as it happened to OCTAVIAN AV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GVSTVS, who suffered Temples to be consecrated to him, and diuine

honours to be giuen him in his life time: Considering also that there is a certaine measure, and proportion of greatnes in Townes, Cities, and States: euen as in liuing creatures, plantes, and instruments: which when it excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth; loseth his nature and vse.

               <p>AMongest the great auncient kingdomes, the ASSYRIAN was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in nobility, mighty in armes, large in compasse of land, and in continuance admirable: which being augmented by Belus, Ninus, and Semiramis; and enlarged by the spacious countries of Asia; was the first that amongest all other Empires (which it farre exceeded) obtayned the name of an established Monarchie: and for the space of a thousand three hundred and threescore yeres, vnder thirtie eight kinges florished greatly. After followed that of the MEDES, which vnder nine kings continued CClxj. yeres: well gouerned in peace, and warre. Then raigned the PER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIANS, who hauing added Egypt vnto their dominion, and increased their strength and riches, when they had prospered two hundred and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeres; they lost their state vnder <hi>Darius</hi> their fourteenth king. From that time forwarde the MACEDONIANS by the successe, and conduct of <hi>Alexander,</hi> obtained the rule ouer Asia; which they lost one hundred and twenty yeres after, giuing occasion by their ciuill dissentions, to the Parthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in the East, and to the Romaines in the West to increase, and grow great. Then the Romaines towardes the West seasing the Macedonian Seigniorie (which though it were great indeed, yet was but weake by the diuision of the princes who had parted it betweene them) established the greatest and fairest Empire that euer was. For if all the famous Monarckes amongest the straungers bee compared vnto the Romaine Emperours, there will not bee founde any amongest them, that haue done greater thinges either in peace or warre: or that haue more enlarged their Empire; and longer main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it.</p>

Against whom some in the Citie of Athens, whiles they yet beheld before their eies the smoking ruine of Thebes, supplanted by the armes of the Macedonians; dared in full assemblies to speak freely, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the writings of their Oratours: would none amongst so many Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine Lords haue spoken freely? Let his greatnes be of so great reckoning: yet shall it be but the greatnes of a man; gotten by the felicitie of little more then ten yeares. And they which extoll him, for asmuch as the people of Rome, hauing not bin ouercome in any warre, yet hath had the worst in sundrie battailes; and that Alexander had the better in all: they do not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that they compare the acts of one man, being yet yong; with those of a people which hath alreadie warred for the space of eight hundred yeares? Do we then meruaile, if on this side be more ages, then yeares on the other; that fortune hath bin more variable in this long space, then in the time of thirteen yeares? Let vs rather compare the fortune with fortune, of one man with another; and of Captaine with Captaine. How many Romain Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines can I name, that neuer had contrarie fortune in battaile? One may see in the Annales of the Magistrates, and in the Calenders, the battailes of the Consuls, and of the Dictatours; whose vertue, and fortune neuer brought any displeasure to the people of Rome: And they are more admirable then Alexander, or any other king; hauing not bin Dictatours some of them aboue ten or twentie daies; and none aboue a yeare. The leuies of men haue bin hindered by the Tribunes; they went often to warre after the season, and haue bin sent back againe before it, by reason of the Comices or Parliaments. The yeare hath bin spent in preparations for enterprises; The temeritie or malice of a Collegue hath caused hinderance, or domage; and when mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters haue bin euill managed, he hath bin succeeded by another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They haue taken new or ill disciplined souldiers.

Then at that time by the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber taken of the Citie, they were found two hundred and fiftie thousand heads. Wherefore in the reuolt of the allies from the name of the Latines, there were leuied well neere ten legions of Citizens. Often times there were fower or fiue armies at a time in Hetruria, and Vmbria; the Gaules being also their enemies: They made warre in Samnia, and against the Lucans. Then afterwards he should haue found all Italie, with the Sabines, Volsces, Eques, and all Campania, and a part of Vmbria, and Etruria; the Piscenians, Marsians, Pelignians, Vestines, Apulians, and all the coast of the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, inhabiting on the inferiour sea, from the Thracians vnto Naples, and Cannes: and from thence to Antia, and Hostia; either mightie with the Romains; or subdued by them. He should haue passed the sea with his old Macedonian souldiers, not exceeding the number of thirtie thousand on foote, and fower thousand on horseback, almost all Thessalians: for this was his strength. If he had ioyned with them the Indians, and other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; they would rather haue bin a hinderance, then any helpe vnto him. Moreouer, the Romaine armie in their owne countrie might easily haue new supplies; and the armie of Alexander would haue waxen old: as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned afterwards vnto Hannibal.</p>
               <p>The armes of the Macedonians were the buckler, and the iaueling, called Sarissa: The Romains vsed a shield, which was greater to couer the bodie, and a speare somewhat rougher, either to strike or throw then the pike. The footemen both of thone, and thother keeping firmely their rankes: but the vnmoueable Macedonian phalange was of one sort; and the Romain squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron manyfold, and compounded of many parts; easie to sunder or ioine, as neede required. Touching their work, there is none like to the Romain, nor better to endure trauaile. Alexander if he had bin ouercome in one bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, would haue made an end of the warre; But what armes could haue quailed the Romain, whom Candie and Cannes could not quaile? Surely, if he had prospered in the first encounter, he would haue bin gon to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians, and Indians, and to the cowardly nations of Asia: as the brute is, that Alexander the king of Epirus, feeling himself wounded to death, said; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the state of the warres made in Asia by this yong Prince, with his.</p>
               <p>When I call to mind, how in the first Punick warre they fought twentie and fower yeares against the Carthaginians, with mightie fleetes by sea; I then think that the age of Alexander could not haue suffised for one war: and peraduenture the Carthaginian state being allied with the Romain by aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient lyne, and the feare being alike against a common enemie, might haue ioyned two such mightie Cities in armes, and men; and then he might

               <head>A COMPARISON OF IVLIVS <hi>Cesar, with Alexander the great, according to Appian.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>ALEXANDER, and IVLIVS CESAR, were both of them verie ambitious, and warlike aboue all others; readie and diligent to execute all enterprises: and impetuous in dangers, euen to the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their owne liues. And their fortune and audacitie was no lesse help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to them both, then their militarie discipline: Of whom thone, namely ALEXANDER, went in the summer season, and thorough countries destitute of waters, to the god Hammon: and hauing passed the gulfe of the sea of Pamphylia, by great hap, and felicitie, he got the countrie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For in his passage ouer the sea, it seemed that fortune with-held, &amp; appeased the raging therof. Afterwards at the beginning of winter, being on his way, he went thorough the rough seas: euen to the Indies. Moreouer, being at the siege of a Towne, he was the first that got vpon the wall, and then leaped downe all alone amongst his enemies; and hauing receiued thirteen wounds; yet remayned notwithstanding inuincible in all things. He subdued many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Europe; and conquered the Greekes by armes, which were a verie warlike nation, and desirous of libertie; and who were neuer accustomed to be subiect vnto any other: till such time as vnder colour of presidence, they were obedient to Philip, the father of Alexander, as to their Protectour. He vanquished almost all Asia; and as one might say, ouercame all that he saw. And finally, as he purposed in his mind to conquer the rest of the world, he died in the flower of his age.</p>
               <p>Touching IVLIVS CESAR, in the sharpest of winter, the Ionian sea was calme, and nauigable vnto him. He sailed also in the Ocean sea ouer against the Isle of great Britaine: and albeit he had not any knowledge of the coast, yet he commaunded his Pilots, who kept a loose off, to put in with their shippes. And in an other place, hauing by night time alone in a little boate espied the passage, hee bid the Master of the shipp set saile to the winde; and to put more confidence in the fortune of CE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SAR, then in the sea. He entered oftentimes all alone on his enemies, when all his people quaked and trembled for feate. He fought in pitched
<pb facs="tcp:13829:95"/>
field against the Gaules thirtie times, and subdued all that Nation: which was so terrible to the Romains; that whereas by the law of the Priests, and of the Auncients, they gaue immunities to the men of armes from seruice, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies added, except it were against the Gaules; in which case there was no excuse, neither for Priest, nor aged person. Moreouer, CESAR fighting neere vnto Alexandria, and seeing himselfe on a bridge, abandoned of all his people, and enuironed on all sides with his enemies; he cast his purple garment on the ground, and then leaped into the sea. And because his enemies pursued him in the water, he kept a long time at the botome, without showing himselfe, sauing now and then, to take breath; till he drew neere to one of his ships: and then stretching out his hand, he made himselfe knowen; and by that meanes was saued. In the ciuile warres (for feare as he said, but in trueth for ambition) he had against him many great and valiant Captaines, of many great armies, not onely of Barbarians, but of Romains also: and he ouer came all his enemies (which had surmounted all others in vertue and felicitie) in one onely battaile, or two. But yet notwithstanding, his armies were not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies inuincible, as those of Alexander: for his Pretors, Cotta' and Titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, fighting against the Gaules, were shamefully defeated; and in Spaine, Petreius, and Afranius, inclosed his armie in such sort, that they were in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner besieged. Also at Dyrrhachium, and in Libia, they were about to run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: and againe in great feare of the yong Pompey. But in as much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the person of <hi>Cesar,</hi> he was euer without feare; and in the end vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious. He inlarged the Romain Empire both by sea, and by land; from the Ocean sea, euen to the riuer Euphrates; aswell by force and vertue, as by his clemencie, and benignitie. His Empire was more firme &amp; better founded then that of Sylla; for he shewed himselfe in effect a king to those which would not haue had it so, although he abstained from the name: and hauing vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken a new warre, he died; as did Alexander. Both of them had armies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most alike: for their men were quick and hardie; louing their chiefes; sharpe and fierce in fight; often disobedient, and readie to mutine against their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours; because of their continuall labour: and notwithstanding, after they were dead, they lamented, and bewailed them greatly; and iudged them wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be honoured as Gods. They were both strong of bodie, and excellent in beamie; both discended of the line of Iupiter; Thone of AEacus, and of Hercules; and thother of Anchises, and Venus. Both of them were conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and rough to such as prouoked them; but easie to be reconciled: pitiful and gracious to their prisoners, and to those which they had ouercome; and liberall toward all people; without couetousnes of any thing, but of the victorie. By such vertues and conditions, they both attained (howbeit by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers meanes) to such great principalitie. For when <hi>Alexander</hi> began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, he had alreadie a kingdom, which Philip had greatly increased<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But <hi>Cesar</hi> of a priuat Citizen (though of a noble race) without any great patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, and without money, attained to this great glorie. Both of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned the great signes that appeared of their death; and notwithstanding,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:13829:95"/>
towards those that foretold their mishap, they shewed no tokens of displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: and their end was almost after one sort; because that both of them had twice together infortunate prognostications; &amp; were either of them at both times in great danger. For ALEXANDER in the Countrie of the Oxydra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, hauing gotten vpon the wall of the enemies, before all the Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, seeing himselfe alone, and abandoned of all, (because the ladders were broken) of a great audaciousnes leaped downe into the Towne amongst his enemies: where being grieuously hurt in the stomack, and the neck, euen as he began to fall, was succoured by his people; who for feare of losing him had broken the gates. CESAR also being in Spain against the yong Pompey; and seeing his men afraied in such sort, that they durst not fight; ran alone into the midst of his enemies: and hauing receiued in his shield aboue two hundred shot, sustained the brunt, till such time, as his men for shame, and feare of him, came to succour and reskue him. And after this maner, their first euill prognostication put them in danger of death: But the second, made them both to die outright. For Apollodorus fearing the force of Alexander, and of Hephestion; Pythagoras, (who was a great diuiner) after Apollodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus had made sacrifice, hauing beheld the entrailes of the beast that was sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed, bad him that he should not stand in feare of them, for both of them should die within a little time. And after that Hephestion was dead, Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus fearing least some should practize the death of Alexander, reuealed vnto him the prognostication; whereof he made but a sport, and demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of Pythagoras, what was signified by that which he had seen; who aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered him, that it betokened death: whereat laughing as afore, he praised Apollodorus as his friend, for that he gaue him warning; and the diuinour for the confidence and assurance which he had in his art. The like almost hapned vnto CESAR as he went vnto the senate, where he was slaine; for when it was told him, that his infortunate sacrifice signified death; he aunswered, that the like befel him, when he was in Spaine: the diuinour then replying, that he was then also in great danger; and that now the signes were more mortall, then they were then; to shew, that he had some confidence in the diuinour, he set him to sacrifice againe, till such time as he saw, that he taried ouerlong in doing thereof, and then all angry he went into the Senate; where he was slaine. The like hapned also to ALEXANDER, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming back with his armie out of the Indies into Babylon; for as he drew neere the Citie, the Chaldees warned him, that he should forbeare for that time to enter into the Citie; to whom he aunswered, reciting a verse to this effect; <hi>Who is the good deuinour, that thinketh well?</hi> Afterward being admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished by the Chaldees, that if (whatsoeuer be fell) he would needs go into the Citie with his armie, he should not turne his face toward the West; but should go round about the Towne, turning on the East side; he was content to please them therin: But finding a marish in his way, that hindered his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, being angry, and mocking at them, he turned towards the West, and went into the Towne: out of which being afterwards gon forth, and come
<pb facs="tcp:13829:96"/>
in a boat on the riuer Euphrates, and after on that of Pallacora, into which Euphrates falleth, to certaine great lakes which are at the mouth of these two riuers; in such sort that they make the land of Assyria almost all nauiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, purposing to inclose the mouth of those said riuers with a wall; he iested (as is said) at the prognostication of the Chaldees; because he was come out of the citie, and had nauigated safe, and sound: But neuerthelesse, being entred into it againe, he ended his daies there shortly after. So hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it vnto CESAR, who meeting in the morning the verie same day that he was slaine with the diuinour, which had foretold him that he should not escape the day of the Ides of March; said to him laughing, that the Ides were come and yet notwithstanding, he was slaine the same day. By this meanes both of them made no account of the prognostications; and yet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the prognosticatours they shewed not any anger: and died both ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their prognostications. Moreouer, they were both verie studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of vertues, and of the sciences; both in the Greeke, Latine, and strange languages: ALEXANDER took paines to vnderstand the learning of the Brachmanes, who are reputed the most learned amongst the Indians; as the Mages are among the Persians. CESAR also going thorough the kingdom of Egipt with Cleopatra, laboured to vnderstand, &amp; to know the sciences of the Egiptians: whereby he afterwards ordered many things wisely at Rome. For the course of the yeare which was il ordained (by reason of the odde monethes and daies called <hi>Intercalares</hi>) because they tooke it according to the course of the Moone, he altered it by the course of the Sunne, as did the Egiptians. It hapned also vnto CESAR, that none of those which conspired his death escaped, but were slaine all by his successours; as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEXANDER had also done to them that had slaine his father.</p>

               <head>A COMPARISON OF THE ROMAIN <hi>warfare, with the Parthian, Carthaginian, and Assyrian.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE militarie exercise of the Carthaginians was principally in matter of the sea; By reason whereof they made little reckoning of footmen; but gaue some order for horsemen: because they were serued by stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and mercenaries. The Parthians vsed not any footmen, neither fought in any order; but by skirmishes confusedly, and vncertainly. On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, the principall force of the Romaines consisted in their footmen, and they fought close in rank and order; neuer forsaking that place wherein they were appointed: resolute to ouercome, or to die. The great cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paignes and large countries, which the Parthians inhabited far from the seas, and where there are but few riuers, being far distant one from an other, were verie fit for their horsemen to run swiftly, from one side to thother: Where on the contrarie, the Romaines being laden with armes, could not keeping their order, make hast without damage, in such places where they found neither vittailes nor waters. Who by militarie discipline and exercise surmounted the multitude of the Gaules, the greatnes of the Germains, the strength of the Spaniards, the riches and cauteles of the Africans; the wisdome and subtelties of the Grecians: albeit they were lesse in all things then these Nations, sauing in the art, and exercise of warre. And hauing gotten the seignorie of a great part of the world, when their Empire was mounted vp to the highest of the wheele, in the time of Augustus; it began then to turne, and to go downwards: when the Citizens of Rome were left out of the hostes which the Emperours gathered; and that they relied on the force of the mercenaries; and of such as they had before ouercome. And howbeit the great vertues which were in Augustus, and his good wit, preserued and vpheld the Maiestie of the Empire, as long as he liued; yet his successours learned of him to intertaine others in pay, besides the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines; as Gothes, Lombards, Germains, Frenchmen, Spaniards, and others; whereof came the ruyne of Rome: for asmuch as the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours following kept an host of strangers, called the <hi>Pretorian,</hi> neere the walls of the Citie of Rome: which maner, albeit at the first it seemed for their aduantage; yet in the end it was their ouerthrow. For this number of souldiers disposed of the Imperiall dignitie at their pleasure; beeing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the place against naked, and vnarmed people. Also the other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies which were in Gaule, Germanie, Pannonie, Suria, Africke, and els<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, would be of aucthoritie; whiles thone of them named one to be Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and an other named another: in somuch that there were sometimes two or three prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding at one time: who thinking ech to consume the other,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:13829:97"/>
consumed the Empire; which had cost so much in the obtaining. But consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that almost all the Emperours were of strange Nations; as also the souldiers which had created them: that made them to care lesse for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing of it, then if they had bin borne of the Citie. Then aswel those which were elected Emperours, as they which had chosen them, marched against the Citie, with the same mind, as they would against their enemies: doing in these changes many spoiles and murthers; aswell on the Emperours them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues; as on the Senatours, and other great persons. Whereas if the institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which the Romains had, in the time whiles their vertue liued, had bin still maintained, (which was to make their warres with their owne people, and not to hire strangers; nor to admit their neighbours or allies into their campe in greater number then they were themselues) their Empire had not bin diuided; neither transported out of their hands: neither their Citie many times destroied and abandoned, as it hath bin. For by maintaining their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer maner of fighting, they should haue auoided all these inconueniences; and haue comen alwaies happely to a good end of all their enterprises: as they did as long as they were serued of their owne Citizens.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, the Romains failed greatly in the intertaining of their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie armies; and prolonging of general militarie charges: which fault was a great furtherance to the ouerthrow of the common wealth, and destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Empire. But the kings of Assyria changed euery yeare their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and their Lieutenants generall: prouiding wisely by such changing, that the souldiers and Captaines, could not so readily vnite themselues one with the other, to conspire against them. For the people that are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally exercised in armes, and hardned vnto labour, are more couragious; and the Captaines which commaund alwaies ouer the same armies, make them partial to themselues; and draw them oftentimes from the obedience of their common wealth, or the seruice of their Prince: as it hath bin discoursed more at large before, speaking of the Assyrians.</p>
               <p>Besides, they yet made an other fault, no lesse then the former: changing the simplicitie of the Romains, into the proud ceremonie of the barbarous kings. For whereas the first Emperours accomodated themselues to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine libertie, not differing from other Lords, but by aucthoritie, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which was borne towards them: went vnto the warres; conducted their armies; conquered Countries; tooke fortresses; bearing all trauailes indifferently with their men of armes; whom they called fellow-souldiers: the later thinking, that to liue in delights and idlenesse, was the soueraigne blisse and happinesse, shut vp themselues in their pallaces; and separated themselues as much as they could from the sight of men; seeing and hearing little; making of themselues Gods inuisible, or seldom seene; and would be worshipped for such; to the end to be more venerable, after the maner of the kings of Assyria, Persia, and Parthia: and tooke a crowne of lawrel, a diademe of gold, a seat and scepter of Iuorie, hose, girdles, and other ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell laden with precious stones; and going forth in this pompous habite,
<pb facs="tcp:13829:98"/>
enuironed with xxiiij. Lictours with fagots, and axes, and with the traine of their pretorian souldiers, they caused a torch or firebrand to be caried before them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and gold land which was brought from far, to be sowed in their way where they should passe, disdayning to touch the bare ground, whereon other men did tread: In such sort, that desiring to seeme more then men, they became lesse then men; their arrogancie on the one side making them odious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their cowardize on the other side contemptible: and by the euill opinion which was held of their life, and little power, they gaue occasion to men to conspire against them, to kill them, or driue them away.</p>

As learning then came first from the Barbarians to the Grecians; and from the Grecians to the Italians; by occasion hereof the Italians in the deep sciences, haue alwaies vsed the inuentions of strangers: or if of themselues they haue written any thing, there hath bin but little soundnes therin. PLINIE writing his natural historie, put his trust in those autors, of whom he receiued the matters: without verifying of them. COR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NELIVS CELSVS a man of reasonable vnderstanding, hauing written of al sciences, hath onely caried away this praise, to be reputed to know al things: and in that which he hath written of Physicke, there is nothing to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of, but the Latin, such as was in his time. The most that is prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in SENECA is, that he sharply reprehendeth the vices; showing himselfe for the rest little Methodical; and somewhat negligent in those matters which hee handleth: relying on such as gathered them; for the trueth of them. CICERO, who boasteth that he hath ioyned Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie, and eloquence of pleading together (which no Grecian had done before him) he is reckoned a better Oratour, then a Philosopher: hauing handled certaine places of philosophie rather for ostentation, then for doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine or institution. And MARC VARRO (who is held the most lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the Romaines) began Philosophie, more to stir vp others, then to instruct them: as the same Cicero witnesseth.</p>
               <p>VIR GIL modestly aduowing the Greekes to be better Oratours, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, Painters, Statuaries, and wrestlers; and the Chaldees, and Egiptians bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Astrologers, Geometricians, and Arithmeticians; and that other strangers did excel in other disciplines: he affirmeth, that the true art of the Romaine is, to subdue the proud<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to be pitifull to those that submit themselues.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:13829:98"/>
Cicero speaketh more brauely, not consenting to make the Latins equal with the Greekes and others: but preferreth them in many things, as in the preface of his Tusculans, where he writeth thus. My Iudgement hath alwaies bin that our men either haue of themselues better inuented then the Grecians; or haue bettered whatsoeuer they borowed of them: for we haue their maners, and fashions of life, their domestical, and familiar affaires better, and seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier ordered. And touching the common wealth, our auncestours haue fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and gouerned it with much better Lawes and institutions. What shall I say of warfare? in which vertue our men haue much excelled; and yet more in good discipline. In regard of other things which they haue gotten by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and not by learning; they ought not to bee compared neither with the Greeks; nor with any other nation. Where was euer such grauity, such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy, such courage, honesty, faith, and such excellent vertue in all kinds, as may be compared to that of our auncestours? Greece surmounted vs before in learning, and all kind of knowledge: wherein it was easie to ouercome such as made no resistance. For the Poets being the most auncient in learning amongst the Grecians (considering that Homer, and Hesiodus were before the building of Rome; and Archilochus in the raigne of Romulus) we haue Poetrie more lately. For about foure hundred and ten yeres after Rome was built, Liuie published a comedy, when C. Claudius the son of him that was blind, and Mark Tuditan were Consuls; a yere before the birth of Ennius: who was auncienter then Plautus and Neuius. The Poets then were but of late knowen, and receaued of vs: although it bee written in the originaries, how people being at the table, were wont to sing to the flute the vertues of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed parsons. Notwithstanding the oration of Cato showeth that this thing was but of small account; wherein he reproched vnto Marcus Nobilis that he caried with him Poets into his prouince: because this Consul had En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius with him into Etolia, as we know. Wherefore by how much the lesse ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour they gaue vnto Poets; their studies were so much the lesse. But this not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding; if any endewed with great wits haue giuen themselues therun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, they haue no lesse aunswered the glory of the Greeks. If Fabius a man of great nobility had bin praised for painting wel; it is to be thought ther had bin amongst vs many Polycletes, and Parrhasies. Honour nourisheth arts, and all are stirred vp to study with glory; and those things alwaies remain vntouched which of al men are reproued. The Greeks esteemed much of the knowledge of singing, and playing on Instruments: wherefore it is said that Epaminon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das (in my opinion the first man of Greece) could very wel play on the Lute. And Themistocles some yeres before hauing refused the harpe, was accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the more ignorant: Then the Musicians florished in Greece, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one learned Musicke; and he which was ignorant therein, was accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the lesse learned. Geometry was in great honour amongest them; and therefore there was no thing more respected, then the Mathematickes: But wee haue moderated these arts by the vtility of numbring, and measuring. On the contrary wee haue eftsoones receaued the Oratour; howbeit not
<pb facs="tcp:13829:99"/>
learned at the first; yet apt to speake: and afterwards learned. For it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that Galba, African, and Lelius were learned; and Cato studious, who was before them. Then Lepidus, Carbo, and the Gracches. And finally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to our age; we haue had such stor<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of learned men, that we yeeld not much, or rather nothing at all, to the Grecians. Philosophy hath bin omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vntill this time (hauing not yet receaued any light from Latin letters) which we must beautifie, and bring to light: wherein we ought to take so much the more paines, because it is said that there are many Latin bookes written inconsiderately, by good and honest parsons; but yet not sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learned.</p>
               <p>The same <hi>Cicero</hi> in his fourth Tusculane; As in many places (saieth he) I haue accustomed to admire the good wits and vertues of our men; so I chieflly admire them in these studies: which being very lately desired of them, haue bin transported out of Greece into this Citie. For the auspices, ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, comices, appellations, counsailes of the fathers, the orders of foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and of horsemen, and of the whole warsare being from the beginning of the citie by royall lawes, and institutions diuinely ordained: Surely then when the common wealth was deliuered from the domination of kinges, it made an admirable increase, and an incredible course in all excellence. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering then the studies of learning; many reasons make me thinke that they haue also bin brought from else-where: and not onely bin desired; but also conserued, and refined. How many and what excellent Poets haue here bin in a little time? and what Oratours? In such sort as it appeareth that our men haue easily attained to all things when they haue bin desirous of them. The studie of wisedome hath bin of auncient time amongst them: Yet doe I not find any that may be called wise-men before the age of Lelius, and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio. While they were yet but yong, I see that Diogenes the Stoick, and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neades the Academick, were sent Ambassadours by the Athenians to our se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; and how that neither of them before had handled any publick affaires; and thone was a Cyrenian, &amp; thother a Babylonian: and that they neuer had bin take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the scholes &amp; chosen vnto this charge; if at that time there had bin any learning in those that were chief of the citie. Who writing in diuers professions, some of them handled ciuile Lawe; others made Orations or Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories, representing the doctrine of good life; the most venerable of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: and more by example of life then by writing. Then in this true, and elegant Philosophy (which began in Socrates, and hath remained amongst the Peripateticks and Stoicks, which say the selfe same thing, but after a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers maner, and the Academickes endeuouring to decide their differents) there are not any Latin writers; or if there be some, they are but a small num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: as well by reason of the greatnesse of the matters; as of the hinderan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of men; or because they thought them not to bee approued of the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant.</p>

               <head>A COMPARISON OF THE LATIN <hi>authours, with the Greeke: and namely of Cicero with Demosthenes.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>QVintilian who came after Cicero, comparing the Latin authours with the Greeke: First touching Heroicall poesie, he giueth the seconde praise vnto Virgil, singularly admiring the happie, and easie natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall vaine of Homer; and in Virgil his diligence, and curious ymitation. In an Elegie he liketh wel of Tibullus and Propertius, whom hee compareth with the Greeke Elegiacks. Concerning the Lyrickes, he accounteth Horace the chiefe of all the Latins, and almost alone deseruing to be read. He confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, Pindarus is not ymitable. That the Latin Tragedie attaineth not to the grauity of Sophocles, and Euripides. And the Comedy yet lesse to the Attick grace, and eloquence. No Latin Poet hath made any Iambicke or Dithyram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicke worke. The Satyre is altogither Latin.</p>
               <p>The Latins were happier in Historie, then in Poesie: Salust being nothing inferiour to Thucydides, and Liuie to Herodotus.</p>
               <p>But touching <hi>Eloquence</hi> Cicero maketh this iudgement of Demosthenes, and himselfe. Demosthenes perfecteth many things; and I begin them. You may iudge that he is able, and that I am willing and that he declareth him selfe according as the matter requireth. But he was excellent, and succeeded vnto excellent personages; and there were many great Oratours in his time. Wee should haue done very much in comming in any sort to that which wee pretended, in the place where as Antony thought, neuer any eloquent man had bin heard.</p>
               <p>It is certaine that these two Oratours, were very like in their Inuentions, and dispositions; keeping the same order, and the same maner of diuiding, preparing, and prouing: But they were different in elocution, and in affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. One is more strict, the other more abundant: The one concludeth in fewer words; Thother disputeth more at large. Thone is more sharpe: and the other for the most parte graue. One can take nothing from thone; nor add any thing to the other. In briefe, there is more diligence in Demosthenes: and more nature in Cicero. It was forbidden in Athens to vse any proemes or epilogues; and it was not lawful in peroring to moue affections; By rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son wherof Demosthenes herein is inferiour: But the Greek tongue which he vsed, is richer and pleasanter then the Latin.</p>
               <p>Moreouer he that would enquire what personages they were, and howe they liued; he shall finde their liues, and fortunes very like. First of al, both the one and the other came from meane place, to great authoritie. They were both banished their cities; and after called backe with great honour. They vndertooke quarrelles against mightie Lords; into whose hands they fell: and died with the libertie of their Citizens. The excellent Poets liuing at rest and solitarie, being remoued from publicke affaires, haue ended more
<pb facs="tcp:13829:100"/>
happely. But besides their foresaid similitudes, and differences; I finde that Demosthenes employed wholly al the sence and science which he had either of nature, or gotten by art of Rhetorick; and that he surpassed in force, and vertue of eloquence all the Oratours of his time; and in grauitie, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence of stile, all those which wrote onely for showe, and ostentation; and in exquisite art, and diligence, all the Sophisters of Greece, and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Rhetorick. And that Cicero was as well seen in many sciences, as a statesman might be; being often emploied in priuate, and publicke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ciuile, and criminali affaires: as may be knowen by many Philosophicall bookes which he hath written of his owne inuention; after the maner of the Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demick Philosophers: and seene by his Orations; in which he sought occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, as he went, to show that he was learned. Also in their stiles may be found some shadowe of their natural disposition; for the stile of Demosthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes hath nothing tending to sport or mirth; but is euery where stricte; and there is nothing in it but pricketh to the purpose, sauouring of great trauaile, with austerity and sharpenes of nature: whereas Cicero vsed oftentimes to iest, euen almost like a Iester or pleasant companion; and tourning in his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings matters of consequence into game, and laughter, because it came som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to his purpose; he sometimes forgat the duetie belonging to a perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of grauity, such as he was. Moreouer, one may see in their workes and compositions, that the one speaketh soberly in his owne praise, so that none could take offence thereat; and neuer but on iust occasion, in regard of some matter of consequence; and is otherwise very modest and sparing to speake of him selfe: Contrariwise the vnmeasurable repetitions of the selfe same things which Cicero vsed commonly in his orations, showed an excessiue desire of glory. And moreouer he praised not only his owne deedes; but also the ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which he had written or pronounced: as if he had bin to contest with some scholasticall Rhetorician; and not to redresse and reforme the people of Rome. For to desire glory for his faire speaking, or (which is worse) to beg it, is an act of a base minde. And therefore in this part, we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that Demosthenes is more graue, and more magnanimous: who him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe said that al his eloquence was but a rote gotten by long exercise; which had yet need of Auditours that would heare it paciently: and that he esteemed them foolish and impertinent (as indeed they are) which glorifie themselues.</p>

               <p>ALl the Latin authours haue complained of the want of their tongue, confessing it to be poore in respect of the Greeke: in the which more persons had written &amp; of mo things.

Theodore Gaza (a Greek by nation,
<pb facs="tcp:13829:101"/>
but very well seene both in the Greeke, and Latin tongues, as any that hath bin sithence the restitution of learning) affirmeth that the Latin tongue is sufficient to represent euery Greeke word and sentence; and that they which cannot tourne the Greeke into Latin, doe indeuour to shadowe their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance by the poorenes of the tongue. Notwithstanding Quintilian doth not dissemble that scarsitie whereinto the auncients were falne; by the scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous seueritie, which they vsed in their speach: And without difficultie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth Latin, to bee rougher in pronounciation; and harder to ioine or deriue wordes: wherein the Greeke is happy and pleasant. The Greeke, and the Latin, haue their sillables long and short; and versification alike: which other tongues haue not so well. The Greeke hath articles; and the Latin hath not: but vseth names without any welt or garde (as one may say) or any kind of addition: and we must not meruaile thereat, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that Homer (who in verse excelleth all others) put articles vnto few names: as if they were handles for vessels that had need of them, or plumes vpon morions. Cicero in his Oration for the Poet Archias, sayth that the Greeke writings were read amongst all nations; and the Latin were shut vp in very straight limits: On the contrary, Plutarch in his Platonicall questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons affirmeth that in his time, almost all the world vsed the Romain language: The Cardinall Adrian, who hath written of the Latin tongue, giueth it foure times; the most auncient, the auncient, the perfect, and the vnperfect: fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the most auncient from the beginning of Rome, to the time of Liuius Andronicus; and the auncient from this Liuie, vnto Cicero, in whose time it was perfect; And the vnperfect, after Cicero; for incontinently vnder Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus it began to lose his naturall puritie, and elegancy; and perished by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little with the maiesty of the Empire: Till at last they left speaking it, &amp; in steed therof succeeded the Italian, which is spoken at this day. Likewise the Greeke florished, with the learning and power of Greece, till the time of Philip, and Alexander: when it fell from his natural propriety, and elegan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: diminishing from that time forward with the liberty of the countrey: and engendring by proces of yeres the vulgar Greeke of this present, being mingled with the Romaine, Turkish, and Arabian: si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence that the countrey hath bin possessed by the Turkes Mahometists: whereof we haue largely spoken in the discourse of Tongues.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S the progresse which armes, learning, and pietie, haue had hitherto, hath bin summarily declared in the two last bookes: hence forwarde shall be another proposed, of the religion, power, knowledge, and other excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Arabians or Sarasens; which requireth no lesse deduction then the former. In the meane time whiles the Empire was afflicted by the barbarous nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Christendome troubled with heretickes; the Sarazens transported to themselues the honour of armes, and of learning. For whereas the church deuided by the Arrians, Nestorians, Manichees, Donatists, and Pelagians; had lost much of her integrity: Then the Empire in the East being vexed by the Persians; in the West, and South, by the Gothes, Vandales, Alanes, Hunnes, and Lumbards; and consequently the light of learning extinguished: in such a confusion the people grieued, and wearied with so many troubles; harkned the more easily vnto Mahomet, when he began to publish his law. Which was so plausible, in hatred of the former contentions, that it was eft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soones receaued into many regions. In so much that the followers thereof haue by succession of time possessed both Asia, and Africke, and a great part of Europe; making them-selues Masters of the best Countries of the world; out of which they banished the ghospell, to giue place to their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran: which the greatest part of mankinde now followeth; speaking the Arabian tongue in the affaires of religion, and the disciplines, euen as Latin is vsed in these partes. So hauing ended so many conquestes, and subdued, innumerable nations, they applied their selues to learning; becomming by the quicknes &amp; sharpnes of their wits: very learned in philosophy, Phisick, Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, Geometry, &amp; other arts. By meanes wherof they got in their tourne great reputation, in the exercise of armes, &amp; knowledge of learning. And as that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>measurable power of theirs extended into diuers countries; so haue they had many valiant Captaines and famous princes for the conduct of their affaires. But there is none more renowmed then MAHOMET, the authour of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran,</hi> and founder of the Sarazen Empire; who being borne of an obscure, &amp; poore pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage, came to great riches, power, &amp; authority, making himselfe the law-giuer of mankind; &amp; making the people beleeue, that he was the prophet and messenger of God. His successors were Eubocara, Homar, Odmen, Hali, Alharen, Moaui, Iesid, &amp; the Caliphes, who prospered merueilously in a little time with those beginnings which Mahomet had giuen them; spreading far &amp; wide togither with their dominion, the Arabian language, &amp; religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
<pb facs="tcp:13829:102"/>
in those countries which they conquered, the Greek, Latin, Punick, &amp; Persian: which was a wonderfull strange mutation. And as they haue bin ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent warriors; so haue they bin no lesse studious; &amp; learned. For they haue had Auicen, a man most learned in thir <hi>Theology</hi> and in all sciences: Auerrois, an expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der of Aristotle; whom those of his time, and which haue come after him, haue had in such admiration, that they haue almost equalled him with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle himselfe; giuing him by excellency the name of the <hi>Commentatour:</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uempace, Algazel, Benbitar, Abaren, and Siphac <hi>Philosophers:</hi> Mesue, Rasis whom they cal Almansor, Serapio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; Zoar surnamed the wise, <hi>Phisitians:</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bumasar, Auenzoar, Gebber, Alpharab; Alphragan, Hali, &amp; Rodoan, <hi>Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</hi> All which florished almost at one time, &amp; haue bin followed by many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as Persians, Syrians, Egiptia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, Africans, &amp; Spaniards writing in the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian tongue: which remaine vnknowen to vs by ignorance of the tonge, &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersity of their religion. They say that <hi>Rhetoricke</hi> is not needful, because that nature plainly, &amp; in few words declareth her conceyts: &amp; albeit they haue (as other nations) many <hi>Historiographers,</hi> yet they make but smal account of histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, especially the Turkes; saying that men dare not write the truth of princes while they are liuing, and that after their decease the memory of them is lost. There are few <hi>Architects</hi> amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, because they giue not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues much to building, the most part of them dwelling vnder tents &amp; pauilions. The others build no houses aboue one story in height like to doue-houses, as in Turkie, mocking at Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that ar so curious in their houses, as if they were to dwel in them perpetually: or if they do build, they are te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples, bridges, stoues, baths, hospitals, &amp; other such like publick edifices: caring little for the priuat, which they comonly make of wood, &amp; of earth, &amp; seldom of squared stone: such va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity being reproued by their Law. They haue yet fewer painters, statuaries, cutters, grauers, &amp; caruers of images, for feare of Idolatry (which they abhor) detesting by reason therof the pictures &amp; counterfeits of all liuing creatures. They haue Poets enough, which paint out their amarous passions, &amp; such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fantasies. The <hi>Alcoran</hi> it selfe is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in meeter, &amp; is altogither poetical. On which is grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded not only their religion, but their politick gouernment, Iustice, &amp; warfare is ruled thereby. Wherfore al <hi>Talismans, Basis, Subasis, Cadis, &amp; Cadilesquets</hi> are bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to vnderstand it, &amp; as neer as they can to accomodate their sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces therunto. The princes themselues haue <hi>Muphtis, &amp; Patriarches</hi> neer vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to take heed to their decrees, &amp; ordinances; &amp; to repeale them if they be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to their religion. For other things, they folow the laws of the <hi>Sultans,</hi> &amp; the customes of the countrey, by reason wherof they haue no other ciuil law, nor Lawiers. The christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which haue writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> against Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, do cal him a diabolical magician, a lier, a deceiuer; &amp; say that he was the son of a Pagan; &amp; borne of a Iew; a theefe, a whore-monger, &amp; a cunning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triuer: an idolater of religion; poore of fortune; presu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptious of vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding; ignorant of learning; &amp; renowmed for vilanies. That at his beginning he was a Marchant, &amp; a driuer of Camels; &amp; afterwards being enriched by the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of a rich widow, became a Captaine, &amp; had charge of the Arabians vnder the Emperor Heraclius. In which seruice he found meanes to get him power
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:13829:102"/>
and authoritie. For whereas the foure thousand Arabians, which serued He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclius had required to haue the military garment giuen them, as wel as to the other men of war; an Eunuche who was Treasurer at this vnhappy time an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered them, that the garment which was reserued for the Romain Souldior ought not to be giuen to doggs. Which they taking in scorne, fel to mutinie, and with the same disdaine incensed the rest of that nation. To whom Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met ioyning him selfe prouoked them farther, and confirmed them in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion. Then was he chosen the chiefetaine by one parte of them, as in sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions they are wont to be chosen, that support the multitude in their euill counsels, and blame their superious. Many despised in him the basenes of his stock, and pouertie of his former life. But to warrant himselfe from this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt (as it is easie towards the simple, and ignorant multitude,) he vsed from that time forward a pretext of diuinity in his actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; calling himselfe no more a Captaine chosen by military fauour, but the prophet and messenger of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God: to thend that vnder colour of this imposture, al men should obey him the more willingly. And whereas he fell oftentimes of the falling euil, to excuse himselfe of this disease, he affirmed that the Angell Gabriel spake vnto him, and brought him the Law: which he published, as spoken by the mouth of God, and reuealed from aboue; albeit it be ful of iniquitie and of lies. He gaue men to vnderstand that God first sent Moises vnto mankinde, then IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS CHRIST with miracles, and because they had not obeyed him, that he sent at that time Mahomet with strong hand, to the end that such as were not moued by miracles should be constrained by armes. And that the Mosai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and Christian law being to rigorous, he was sent to soften them, by the publication of more easie precepts. That there should come no other messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and that he was the last, that was foretolde by Christ in the ghospel. And so hath established a new sect and most pernicious, mingled of the old, and new testament, whereof he hath peruerted many places, endeuouring to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert the holy Trinity, and to abolish the diuinity of Iesus Christ, and the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of his death, passion, and resurrection.</p>
            <p>But those of his side, which wilbe called <hi>Musulmans</hi> doe speake much o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, and do exalt him infinitely: as the most excellent parsonage of the world, hauing maliciously inuented many lies of his pretended excellency, to make him the more admirable, and to drawe the more people to his beliefe. Amongst others they haue dreamed of a prophetical light, which appeared first in Adam, then was continued from prophet to prophet, vntil Mahomet: shyning in their faces euen as the sun in faire weather, and the moone when it is full. That as soone as a new prophet was conceiued, it passed from the husband to the wife, and the child borne of her; and remained with him, til being waxen great he had ingendred another. As soon then saith he, as Adam was created, as he stood vp his braine shaked, and made a noise as the leaues do which are shaken with the wind; and that Adam wondring thereat, God said vnto him; The sound which thou hast heard, and whereat thou meruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest, is the signe of the prophets, and messengers which shall preach my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements:
<pb facs="tcp:13829:103"/>
and therefore thou shalt take heed, that the same seed of light be not put, but into a cleane wombe. And when he had ingendred Seth (who is the father of the prophets, and the chiefe of the messengers of God) at the instant that light passed from the face of Adam, into the face of Eue; who while she was with child, shined in such sort<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the birdes of the aire, and beastes of the earth, wondered at the beauty and brightnes of her face. Adam himselfe was astonied therewith. Euery day the Angels saluting her, brought her odours of Paradice, till such time as shee brought forth Seth alone; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that afore shee alwaies had two at a burden, male, and female; bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and sister. Seth being borne, caryed in his face the shyning of that light, which before his mother bare: which light remained straight betweene heauen and earth, the Angels descending thereby vpon Seth, and crying al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies; <hi>Reioyce thou earth worthy of the light of Mahomet: on him bee the praier of God, and the saluation.</hi> When his father Adam drew neere to his end, he declared vnto him by his Testament the mystery of the light; and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogie of the prophetes. Then descended Gabriel accompained with lxx. thousand Angels, bearing euerie one of them a white leafe, and a pen which signed the writing, saying that, <hi>His voice was exalted, and that the will of God was, that the order of the propheticall generation should be continued.</hi> So Seth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the writing signed, and was clothed by the Lord, with a doublered garment shyning as the sunne, and soft as the violet floure. They affirmed that this light passed after this maner from Adam to Seth, from Seth to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch; and from Enoch by continuall succession to Noe, and Sem; then to Abraham, at whose birth two lights comming out of the East, and the west, met togither in the middest of the earth, enlightning the whole world in one: and the Angels were heard singing, that it was the light of the Prophet Mahomet, who should be borne of his seede; whose word should be in the vertue of God. This light passed from Abraham to Ismael, and from Ismael to Amofre, to whom it seemed, that their grew forth of his loines a tree, whose branches shyned, and reached vnto heauen: and that by the boughes thereof there went white men vp and downe. He vnderstood of the deuinours, that this high tree signified a great lignage, which should lighten the earth, and clime vp into heauen. From Amofre it came to Abdamutalib the Graundfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Mahomet, a personage replenished with all vertue; and when there was any drought, as soone as this light shined on the earth, it presently rained there. An elephant prostrated himselfe before him, &amp; speaking with the voice of a man said: (Saluation be on you, and on the light that shineth out of your reines. Dignity, fame, honour, and victory be on you, and that there shoulde proceede forth of him a king greater then al the kings of the earth. An other time sleeping on the stone which was placed by Abraham in his Oratorie at Mecha, he dreamed that there issued out of his reines a chain parted in foure, on one side stretched toward the East, on thother side towards the west; vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards as high as heauen, and downewards to the botome of the depth: and that sodainly it was all wound vp togither, and then changed into a great
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:13829:103"/>
herbe, greene and florishing, such as was neuer seene amongest men. That in the meane time there stood by him two olde men; towards whom tourning he asked them who they were; and they confessed that the one of them was Noe, and thother Abraham, prophets of the most high God; and tolde him that out of his reines should come a man, by whome the heauen and earth should beleeue, and all nations should be conuerted vnto Iustice and trueth. The Magicians Sorcerers, &amp; deuinours conspired against Abdalle the sonne of Abdamutalib, and father of Mahomet, for to kill him: because that al their practise was to be ouerthrowen by his seed: and to him was giuen a Tutour, as a defender; who seemed as a man, but was none: who perpetually watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ouer him, tourned away al their mischieuous deuises. Also the Iewes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired against him, and he was preserued from them by lxx. Angels, which seemed men, and were not. Leauing all other women he wedded Emina; and when the time was come which God had foreseen, and prescribed, to put finally into the worlde the light of the prophet Mahomet, the voice of the Lorde was heard, saying: <hi>The gates of Paradise should be opened, and the inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of his secret manifested: for it pleaseth me this night to transport the light of my prophet from the reines of Abdalle into the wombe of Emina, and that it come into the world.</hi> This being done, as Abdalle the Iudge and Lord of the Arabians, went vnto the house of praier, he perceiued a great light, to ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten from his house vp towardes heauen: and by and by he dyed; leauing his wife with childe. And within twelue daies after, Mahomet was borne; Then all Idoles fel, and became blacke. All kingdomes were destroied from the East vnto the West, and not one stood vpright. Lucifer was cast into the bottome of the sea where he remained fortie daies; and with much a doe came out therehence: then calling all his fellowes he shewed them that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet was borne; who would take away all their power: and therefore they should determine to corrupt the worlde with hypocrisie, riotousnes, and pleasure. At the same hower God made it to bee vnderstood thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out heauen and earth that hee had a faithfull, and happy friend borne vnto him. His mother witnessed, that in bearing and bringing him forth in her child-birth she felt not any paine at all; and that from aboue there were sent to nourish him, flockes of birdes, with beakes of Emerauldes, and winges of hyacinth, who lifting vp their eies from the East toward the West, and looking towards the child, perceiued that he was almost fledged; and helde out his handes, as it were to pray vnto God. There came also a man clothed in white rayment, presenting him with three keies like vnto pearles; which hee tooke, namely the key of victory, the key of the lawes and the key of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy: And afterwarde came three persons with their faces shyning; of whome the first caried a cawderon of Emeraudes, with foure handles of pearles well appropriated; and offering it vnto him said: <hi>This is the world and his foure corners; East, West, North, and South.</hi> Mahomet accepting it all it was foretolde him, that hee should commaund ouer all the worlde: And when this man had washed him thrice, hee kissed his forehead, speaking
<pb facs="tcp:13829:104"/>
thus; <hi>Be glad O Mahomet; for that is reserued for thee, which hath bin deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto the prophets; which surmountest all in wisedome, and magnanimity: And the key of victorie being especially giuen thee, thou shalt be without feare; and there shall bee none remayning in the worlde but shall tell of thy name:</hi> And then assembled all sorts of birdes, the cloudes, and the windes, and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the companies of Angels striuing for the nourishment of the child. The birdes said that they were fittest: considering that they could gather fruites from diuers places. The windes, that they could fill him with odours. The cloudes that they would nourish him most conueniently; hauing meanes to imparte vnto him the sweetenesse of waters. The Angels being angred said, that there remained nothing for them: But a voice from aboue appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the debate; declaring that he should not be taken out of the handes of men; and that happie shoulde bee those brestes which shoulde giue him sucke; happie the handes which should handle him; and happie should be his house and his bed. An asse being almost famished with honger, kneeled downe to worship him; and hauing him on her backe, lift vp her head, and went beyond the others, which had gotten before her: And when as euery one meruailed thereat, the asse answered for her selfe speaking in the voice of man; <hi>Thus hath God restored me as I perished, and hath raised me from death to life: O if you knew what I beare: It is the seale of the prophets, the Lord of the messengers, better then all the former friends of God.</hi> Three men caried him vp to a mountaine, and ript vp his belly, without griefe or harme. The first opened him from the brest vnto the nauell, and washed his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trailes with snowe; The seconde cleaued his harte in the midst, and tooke out thereof a blacke graine, saying it was the portion of the deuill; The third clensing the place, made him whole againe. Hee was then thus nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished according to their fabulous saying; and grewe in such sorte, that hee neuer gaue any cause of trouble or griefe to those which nourished him. Seraphin kept him three yeares; and Gabriel ninteene; who gaue vnto him the Lawe in the fortieth yeare of his age; and caried him to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: Wherehence being descended, and associated with Eubocara, Haly, and Zaid, hee calleth him selfe the prophet of God; preaching publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie. And not onely maketh himselfe beleeued by his worde; but also by force, (considering that the sworde preuaileth more with people, then reason) fighting often against his aduersaries: in so much that they rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon twentie and two expeditions of his; hauing bin present in person at nyne; and in his life time giuen eighteene battailes in which hee obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned victorie: conquered <hi>Mecha</hi> with the places rounde about; and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed the rest of Arabia. Then seeing himselfe fortified, hee wrote to the Princes of other languages, as to the King of Persia, the Emperour of the Romaines, the king of Ethiopia, and others; that they would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receaue his Law.</p>
            <p>They haue forged many other lies of him like vnto these, which I wil pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely omitt, fearing tedious prolixity: and least in reciting of scandalous
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:13829:104"/>
blasphemies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I should offend Christian eares. As touching his death, they say he died of a Plurisie, or of the falling euill, the Lxiij. yeare of his age: and that hauing foretold in his sicknesse, that the third day after his death he should be caried into Heauen; the people expecting it, kept him so long, that by the stinch of his carion, they were constrayned to burie him at <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina,</hi> surnamed since of the Prophet.</p>
            <p>Such then was the beginning of the Algier of MAHOMET<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is to say: of his raigne, which endured ten yeares; after the which his followers do recken their yeares, as we do ours after the Natiuitie of Christ. His pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and successours (continuing the enterprise) haue persisted till this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, in the publication of that Lawe, by preaching, and by force: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their power verie great; and spreading with their Empire, the Arabian religion, and language, almost in all parts of the habitable earth. Then the Mahometists made at the beginning great conquests, vnder the gouernment of one only Lord called the <hi>Caliphe,</hi> which was king &amp; priest together, hauing the superintendence, and conduct of all their affaires: concerning not onely pietie and iustice; but also armes and reuenewes; all possessions, sacred or prophane; libertie, and bondage; life and death. But as they increased in countries, so they entred into partialities; and while this schisme endured, they created in <hi>Egipt</hi> an other Caliphe: leauing him of <hi>Bagdet,</hi> as too super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious, and rigorous; who excommunicated them, and declared them He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks. The Caliphe of <hi>Bagdet</hi> commaunded in all the East. And thother of <hi>Egipt,</hi> who diminished his authoritie, had but little lands at the first: But he conquered in proces of time all Barbary; and a great part of Spaine. For the Saracens vnder his obedience passed into Africk; where they tooke Carthage, Maiorca, Minorca; and following their good fortune<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> marched as far as Mauritania: And still endeuouring to increase, they passed into Europe, at the perswasion of an Earle a western Gothe, called Iulian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who (beeing much moued with the outrage done by King <hi>Rodericke</hi> to his wife) caused them to passe ouer the streight of Sebi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>a, and to come into Spaine: where at their first coming they gaue many battailes to the Visigoths; and in the last slew all their Nobilitie: In such sort, that Spaine came into their possession, all except Esture, and Biscay.</p>
            <p>The other Saracens sailed into Thrace, and held Constantinople three yeares besieged; which they were constrained to abandon, being consumed by famine and pestilence.</p>
            <p>An other time they came into Italie, and hauing seized on Apulia, they ouerran the countrie, as far as the port of Hostia; and entring into Rome, burned the Churches of the Apostles, possessed the coast of Tuscane, of Prouince, and Languedock; spoiled Genua, Auignon, and Narbona; went into the gulf of the Adriatick sea; where they ouercame the fleete of the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians. After so many conquests they promised the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues the entier Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie of the whole world. For hauing vanquished the East, subdued Africk,
<pb facs="tcp:13829:105"/>
ouercome Italie; and tamed Spaine; they did not think there were any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or kings on the earth, which durst vndertake to resist them: making account to subdue all others in short space, by the onely feare of their name. Ten yeares after they had bin in Spaine, they determined to passe farther: and taking for a good presage, the request which Eudon the Duke of Aquitaine made vnto them, (thinking to find a better, and fairer countrie) they went to the number of fower hundred thousand into Gascony; carrying with them their wiues, and children, as if they had the victorie already assured. For see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things at the first to succeed vnto them prosperously, they became so proud, that they vtterly disdained the Christians. They had already ouerrun and spoiled all the countrie, as far as <hi>Tours;</hi> whither being come with their great armie, they were encountred by CHARLES MARTEL, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the forces of France and Germanie; where he discomfited CCCLxx. thousand; hauing lost but fifteen hundred of his. It is not remembred that the Saracens were euer better chastized; or lost so many braue men, and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Captaines: All passed the edge of the sword, euen women and little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Whiles the Saracens wasted and ouerran the Gaules, two Comets ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in heauen, for the space of fourteen daies; whereof the one was seen in the morning before the sun-rising; and thother in the euening after the sun was set: which flaming looked towards the North. There remained of these Saracens euen to our time, holding the kingdome of Granado: where hence they were driuen out about a hundred yeares sithence; and cleane ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished Europe by king FERDINAND. Others remayning in Africk, and hauing lost their domination, are diuided into many Seignories; and into two sorts of people: whereof thone inhabite the plaines, &amp; the Cities; the other wander continually on the mountaines: They are much fallen from their former power and militarie reputation; and likewise from their excellencie in learning.</p>

And they attributed them vnto the diuinitie vnder different names, according to the opinions of the Countries where they were; as Zoroaster the Lawgiuer of the Bactrians, and of the Persians, to Horosmades; Trisme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistus of the Egiptians, to Mercury; Zamolsis of the Scythians, to Vesta, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rondas of the Calcides, to Saturne; Minos of the Candians, to Iupiter; Numa of the Romains to Egeria; and such other personages: who hauing to deale with rude and rough people, and intending to bring in great nouelties into

the gouernments of their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries, fained that they had communication with the Gods: as if that fiction had bin profitable to those whom they made so to beleeue. So Mahomet, purposing to giue Lawes to the rude and grosse Arabians, liuing for the most part of robberies on the mountaines, made them beleeue, that he receiued them from God by the Angel Gabriel; to make them obey them the more willingly.</p>
               <p>And as Pythagoras had made an Eagle tame, which was vsed to come downe to him by a certain voice; as she flew in the aire aboue his head: and as he passed thorough the Olympian games, suffered his thigh to be seen, which seemed all of gold; and many such other deuises which are told of him, seeming to be miracles: So Mahomet had tamed and taught a pigeon, which came to eate corne out of his eare; which to deceiue the people, he said was the holie Ghost, who inspired him with these precepts. Almost all founders, or reformers of common weales, and kingdomes, going about to bring in new lawes, and maners, seized on the soueraigne force and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; to the end to feare, and to refraine such as would oppose themselues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it: knowing that such alteration could not be made without violence, and force; and that otherwise, they should neither haue bin heard, nor fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed: So Mahomet, calling himselfe the Prophet, and messenger of God, sent to giue the Law vnto men, made himself beleeued, not onely by word, but also by force; and fought oftentimes against his aduersaries. Lycurgus referred all his Lawes to the warre, and to victorie: And Mahomet all his discipline to fighting, and commaunding; placing the felicitie of man in great power, and largenes of Empire. Pythagoras was of opinion, that the first cause was not sensible, nor passible; but inuisible, &amp; incorruptible, and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intelligible. And Numa following him, forbad the Romains, to make the forme of God, like to any man, or beast: in such sort, that at the beginning, there was not at Rome any Image of God, neither painted nor molten. And a long time they had not in their Temples any statue or figure of God; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting it sacriledge to seek to represent heauenly things by the earthly: (as Plutarch saith) considering that it is not possible any way to attaine to the knowledge of the diuinitie, but by the vnderstanding. For the same reason, Mahomet saith, he forbad all images, and figures of things that haue life; not suffering in his <hi>Mosgedes,</hi> or Temples, any corruptible thing whatsoeuer: sauing lampes burning on high all in a rank; and matts below to kneele vpon; that comming thither barefoote, they should not hurt themselues with cold.</p>
               <p>Solon did write in Greek verse, the Lawes which he gaue to the Athenians; and Mahomet his Alcoran in Arabian meeter, which is altogether poetical. The Assyrians inuented many fictions of their Queene Semiramis, which had built Babylon. The Persians of Cyrus, who founded their kingdome. The Romains of Romulus, who began Rome, and the Romain Empire; to the end to make them more admirable. But the Mahometists haue exceeded the fables of all the rest in their Mahomet; exalting him infinitely: as the most

               <p>PLinie speaking of the Arabians, saith: that they were not inferiour to any people of the world. They receiuing the law of Mahomet (who was of their nation) were called Saracens, who in little time after they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued this Religion, atchieued great conquests, subdued many Regions, tooke, and ruinated Townes, wasted countries, ouerthrew kingdoms, and namely the Romain Empire in the East. But as they increased sodainly in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, so they entred into partialities, and diuided themselues vnder two Caliphes: whereof the one was established at <hi>Bagdet</hi> in Assyria, commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ouer all the East, thother in <hi>Egipt,</hi> who conquered all the rest of Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie with Spaine.

               <p>AS the learning of the Greekes and Romaines augmented with their power; so did that of the Arabians, or Saracens. And when they were the most mightie of the world, then they became most learned: espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

in the demonstratiue sciences. Amongst whom Auicenna, Albumasar, Gebber, and Auerrois, got the first praise. Auicen hath bin the most vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall of them all; being eminent in philosophie, in the Mathematics; in their Theologie; &amp; in the Arabian poesie: who writing also in Physick, hath verie well handled (according to the iudgement of the most learned in this art) the signes and causes of diseases; accomodating vnto them many remedies not vnderstood, nor practised, by the Greeks and Italians. Auerrois hath lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly expounded all Aristotle. Abumasar vnderstood perfectly al the celestial motions, and their effects: hauing inuented the great coniunctions, and many other goodly things which remained vnknowen vntill his time.

And others in diuers sciences haue inuented many new things, or reformed those that were inuented before: both Persians, Syrians, Egiptians, Africans, and Spaniards, writing in Arabian; which possessed the schooles of the West, before the restitution of the Greek and Latin. Which I thought good to speak of by the way; that it might be knowen, that all lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is not comprised in these two languages, &amp; that the Arabian ought not to be dispised; which comprehendeth a good part. They got such reputation in the Mathematicks, that Alphonsus king of Castile, going about to make his Astronomical tables, had his principal recourse to them; because that only they at that season could teach and restore such sciences: to whom he made great presents, to the value of fower hundred thousand Crownes: Imitating therein the liberalitie of Alexander, who disbursed the like summe, to haue the natures of liuing creatures truely represented by Aristotle.

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>N the different which was between the Caliphes; The TVRKS comming out of the Northeast of Scythia, went into Asia, about the hundreth yeare of the Algier of Mahomet; and after they had a long time wandered, they staied in Persia: whither they came, being called by the Persians against the Arabians, and others of the new Religion, which oppressed them. But finding at their comming the kingdom of Persia vanquished, aswell by armes, as by religion; and seeing it was not possible for them to resist against the conquerers, they confederated with the Arabians, receiuing their Religion. And anon after on the occasion which they took hold of, they rebelled and seized the Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat of <hi>Bagdet,</hi> which they a long time held. Their power was growen and increased in such sort, that at such time as the Frenchmen, vnder the conduct of <hi>Godfrey of Bouillon</hi> went to recouer the holy land, they ruled alreadie ouer the better part of Asia: Wherehence they were driuen out after many victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries gotten on them by the Latin Christians, by the Georgians, &amp; Armenians.</p>
            <p>After the departure of the Turks, the CORASMIANS seeing the kingdome of Persia disfurnished of defence, inuaded it; and created their Seignior, Emperour of Asia: Then vndertaking to possesse Turkie, they were
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:13829:107"/>
beaten back; losing their Emperour, who was slaine there: and they could not rise againe, but were by little and little defeated.</p>
            <p>And they being destroied, the TARTARIANS began to be celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Asia; who came from the same quarter, wherehence the Turkes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had come, as appeareth by their language, and similitude of maners: whose beginning, progresse, victories, and conquests, are more admirable, then of all the Nations that euer were before, or after; in greatnes of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, celeritie of expeditions, successe of battailes, largenes of Seignories, foundations of Empires, and maner of liuing, much different from others. First they inhabited that part of Scythia, which is beyond the great moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of Belgian, towards the Indies: to which place came the armes of the Macedonians vnder the conduct of Alexander. And being a beastlie people without maners, without learning, without religion, liuing on beasts which they kept, and nourished, wandring from place to place, following the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie of pasturage; vnfit for armes, dispised of all, and tributaries to their neighbours: yet they increased so much, that they were diuided into seuen principal peoples; and began to liue vnder Captaines, who had the conduct of them, and of their affaires; remaining notwithstandtng vnder the subiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others: vntil such time as a poore old man, a Smith by his occupation, (who as they beleeue was ingendred of the sun-beames) was diuinely ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their first CHAM, and Emperour. For he saw in his sleepe a man of warre, clothed all in white, and mounted on a white horse, which called him by his name, and said vnto him, <hi>Changuis, The will of the immortall God is, that thou be the gouernour of the Tartarians, and ruler ouer the seuen Nations: to the end, that by thee they may be deliuered out of the bondage wherein they haue long remayned, and receiue the tributes which they haue bin accustomed to pay.</hi> CHANGVIS was verie glad when he had heard the word of God; and told vnto euery one this vision. But the Captaines and chiefe men amongst them would not harken to it; but made a ieast thereof: Till themselues the night following saw the white man of armes, and had such a vision, as he had declared vnto them; who were commaunded from the immortall God, to be obedient to CHANGVIS, and to accomplish his commaundments in all things. Then being assembled together, they did their obedience and reuerence vnto him, as to their naturall Lord: Then they spred in the midst of them a black couering on the ground, and a seat on it, wheron they placed CHANGVIS, calling him the first CHAM, and doing him solemne reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with kneeling. Which custome (though it be base) hath bin sithence obserued by them in confirming of their Emperours: albeit they haue gotten many kingdomes, and infinite riches, hauing inuested themselues of Asia, and Europe; euen to Hongary, and Austrich. CHANGVIS being thus esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished Emperour, by the consent of all; would make triall whether they would obey him faithfully; commaunding them many things: And first that they should all beleeue in the immortall God, by whose grace he was come to the Imperiall dignitie. Secondly he ordained, that there should be made a
<pb facs="tcp:13829:108"/>
generall view of all such as were able to beare armes; and that the muster being made, there should be appointed a Captaine ouer ten; ouer a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand; and ouer ten thousand: making the regiment of this assembly. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer he commaunded the foresaid seuen Captains, to bereaue themselues first of their charges, and dignities: Thother commandment was yet more strange, by which he inioyned them to bring euery one his eldest sonne, and ech to cut off his head, with his owne hand. And albeit that seemed cruell and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust; yet was there not any that refused it: forasmuch as they accounted him to haue bin appointed their Lord by the diuine prouidence. When he had knowen and proued their good wills, and that they were readie to obey him, euen to death; he assigned them a certaine day to march forward. And from thence he went against many Nations; which he incontinently sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued: and possessed all the lands on this side of the mountain <hi>Belgian,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioined them without any gain-saying, vntill such time as he had an other vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: seeing the same white armed man againe, which said vnto him: <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis Cham; The will of God is, that thou passe ouer the mountaine Belgian, and go toward the West, where thou shalt conquer kingdomes, seignories, and lands, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing many Nations vnto thy Empire. And that thou maist be assured that it is true, and proceedeth from God, which I tell thee; arise, and go with thy people towards that mountaine, to that part which ioyneth on the sea: There thou shalt kneele downe nine times, and worship God nine times; and he which is almightie will show thee the way which thou maist go conueniently.</hi> According to this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, Changuis reioicing arose, and without any doubt (because the first vision being found true, assured him of the rest) he gathered together all his people: commaunding them to follow him with their wiues and children, and all that they had. Then they went so long, till they came where the great and deepe sea toucheth the mountaines; and there appeared no way nor pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage for them. Changuis as was commaunded him from the immortall God alighted off his horse (as did also all the rest) and kneeling towards the East, worshipped God, asking mercie, and grace of him, and that he would show them the way to go. They remained that night in praier; and arising in the morning, they saw the sea retired nine foot, and that it had left a spacious way. Being all astonished with this miracle, they thanked God deuoutly: and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the West, they went men and women, beastes, and chariots, a great and terrible multitude.</p>
            <p>The yeare before this their discent, which we reckon of Christ, M.CCxj. in the moneth of May, appeared for the space of eighteen daies a Comet, burning ouer the <hi>Polaques,</hi> the riuer of <hi>Don</hi> or <hi>Tanais,</hi> and the Countrie of <hi>Russia,</hi> the taile thereof directed towardes the West: which signified the discent of the Tartarians, which hapned the next yeare following. If this be true, it resembleth much the going of the Hebrewes out of the lande of Egipt, vnder the conduct of Moses; to whom the redd sea opening it selfe, gaue passage; and drowned the Egiptians pursuing after them. Iosephus writeth also, that the Sea of Pamphylia opened vnto Alexander the Macedonian, when hee marched with his Armie against
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:13829:108"/>
the Persians. But the Tartarians being passed ouer: their Cham fell sick and died, hauing before commaunded concord between his twelue children, by the similitude of arrowes which could not be broken altogether; but being separate, they brake them easilie, saying to them: that as long as they agreed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their Empire should endure; and should be ouerthrowen as soone as they were diuided. And before his death made his eldest sonne called HOCO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TA, the best and wisest of them to be receiued as their Lord, and his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour; who purposing to march further, wan the Caspian gates being pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced there, and continually kept and shut vp: to the end to stop the passage into Asia of infinite people dwelling beyond it, as it were in an other world. Afterward he dispatched three armies, and gaue them to three of his sonnes: commaunding Iacchis being the eldest to go toward the West; Batho toward the North; and Tagladais toward the South. He himself abounding in men, marched with a mightie armie into the East, conquering all the Countrie as far as Catay: where he established that most mightie and rich Empire, which is there at this present, and held by those which discended of him. He ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came also the kingdome of Persia: in which voiage the Tartarians learned the knowledge of letters, the vse whereof was before vnknowen amongst them. He fauouring the Latin Christians which raigned at Hierusalem came to succour them: But being preuented therof by their ouerthrow, before he came; he drew towards Bagdet, where he took the Caliphe being a Turk by nation, whom he made to die of famine and thirst; hauing shut him vp into the chamber of his treasures, as a man vnworthy to possesse that riches, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he could not help himselfe. TAGLADAIS going into the South, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried armes euen into Ethiopia; where he had euill successe: for being ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in battaile by the Ethiopians, and driuen into desert countries, he lost there the greatest part of his people. Then he turned him towards the West, and ioyned with his brother IACCHIS; who had much afflicted the estate of the Turkes in Persia, Assyria, and Mesopotamia. The voiage of BATHO was more succesful, &amp; renowmed; who hauing in a great battail ouercome Gonata king of the Turks; he supplanted eft soones by armes the whole raigne of that nation. He vanquished the Rosullanois, Lapiges, Pola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques, Lithuanians; and pierced euen into Hongary, Austrich, and Germanie: putting all wher he went to fire and sword. Such were in a little time the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible expeditions of the TARTARIANS in the North, South, East, and West, thorough the great emotion and mutation of humaine things. Wherefore the Christian Princes, and the Pope especially, fearing their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, sent Ambassadours to their Emperour, to thend to pray him that he would acknowledge and worship the GOD of all, and Iesus Christ whom he had sent; and vse no more such crueltie against the Christians, as he had done in Polonia, Hongaria, and Morauia: He aunswered, that in fiue yeares he would not molest them. After the departure of the Ambassadours of the Christians, came those of the Saracens, to perswade the Tartarians to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the law of Mahomet: as easier, &amp; more conuenient for militarie people;
<pb facs="tcp:13829:109"/>
Saying, that the Law of Christians was of idle effeminate idolaters, and worshippers of Images<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that theirs was full of all commodities, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, a conquerer of other religions by force, and armes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with beating down the proud imposed tribute on such as were humbled. That pleased well the barbarous people, being of nature couragious; and giuen to sensualitie: And so they receiued the Law of Mahomet, which they obserue at this day. They hold much land in Europe, ioyning to Russia, Lithuania, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia: In Asia all that lieth from the riuer Tanais, and the bounds of Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus and Bacchu, vnto Cathay and Chyna.</p>
            <p>The ZAGATHAINS confining on the Persians, are more ciuile, sowing, planting, buylding, traficking, being gouerned in a kingdome; and haue for the seat of their king called CVSILBAS, enemie to the Sophi, the Citie of <hi>Smarcand,</hi> being meruailous great, faire, and rich: situated in the riuer Iaxartes, fower daies iourney from the Caspian sea, where the great Tamberlain was borne, of whom we will speak hereafter.</p>
            <p>The great CHAM of Catay is also a Tartarian, discended of the race of Ghanguis, of whom seeing it commeth to purpose, we will here intreat; albeit he be no Mahometist: but hath a religion separate, and different from the Mosaical, Christian, and Saracen. It is not without cause that he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led great; for he exceedeth in politike gouernment, power, wisdome, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenew, and magnificence, all the Princes of Europe, Asia, and Africk; yea, euen the Turk himselfe. And if all the Christian and Saracen Seigno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were reduced vnder one obedience; yet could they not be compared vnto his. He commaundeth ouer more then seuen hundred leagues of Countrie, well inhabited and peopled: full of faire buyldings, after our maner; villages, boroughes, castels, rich and strong townes, abundance of vittailes of all sortes, and exquisite Artisans. The CATHAYANS or men of CHINA, haue such an opinion of themselues, that they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count themselues to be the chiefe men of the world; thinking other men to be but halfe sighted, as if they sawe but with one eye: and that they only see cleerely with both eyes; by reason of their subtilitie and dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, making such perfect, and liuely workes, that they seeme not to be made by mans hand, but by nature her selfe. They haue learning and the sciences in singular recommendation, honour, and estimation; recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing none to the soueraigne dignitie, nor to publike offices, but such as are learned: Considering that in the distribution of their offices and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracies, they respect not nobilitie, nor riches; but learning and vertue onelie.</p>
            <p>OTTOMAN the first authour of the familie of the OTTOMANS, and founder of the Turkish Empire, which is so mightie at this day, hauing againe set vp the name of the TVRKS, which before was abolished, serued in the warres at the first vnder the great Cham: He came but of meane place, and was poore in possessions; but strong of bodie, and of courage audacious. Thinking that he had some wrong done him, he parted from the Tartarians,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:13829:109"/>
and accompanied only with fortie horses, he seized on some straight in the mountains of Cappadocia; Then being holpen by the commoditie of place, and opportunitie of time, he began to make rodes in the plaines adioyning, getting great spoiles: To whom there ioyned many theeues; multiplying from day to day. Then seeing himselfe reenforced with men, he did manifestly and in open warre, that which he did priuily, and by stelth before; conquering townes, people, and countries, without any great resistance: In such sort, that in short space he got a great Seignorie in Asia: which hath bin valiantly and happily maintained by his successours discending of him, and bearing his name; which haue alwaies augmented it, vntill the thirteenth which raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth at this present; hauing one after an other from the father to the sonne, gathered together two Empires, aboue twentie kingdoms, and a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Cities in Asia, and Europe; gotten aswell on the Mahometists, as on the Christians; without euer losing any thing that they had taken. They hold all that was in old time called Arabia, Egipt, Suria, Mesopotamia, Chaldea, part of Persia, and of Media, Assyria, Adiabena, part of the greater Armenia, and all the lesser, and a part of Cholches, which they call Mengrelles; All Asia the lesser containing Cilicia, Cappadocia, Pamphylia, Galatia, Caria, and Phrygia: And in Europe, a part of the Sarmatians, or Getes; the Dacians, Mysians, Thracians, Macedonians, Greeks, Albaneses, Dalmatians, Pannoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Hongarians, Iaziges, and Metanastes: In Africk, Argier, Tripoli, and Tunez. This vnmeasurable power so renowmed, and terrible at this day vnto all the world, is growen vp from so small a beginning, as hath bin said, to such heigth, and reputation, in the space of two hundred and sixtie yeares; by their wise conduct in peace, and in warre, by sobrietie, patience, obedience, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, diligence, order, valiancie, abundance of men, horses, and armes; and by meanes of the good, militarie, and politick discipline, which they carefully obserue: which hath made them to prosper with the hinderance of their neighbours, being loose, and corrupted, or infected with seditions. Perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture they are not entirely such as they haue bin (as all impaire with time) and being inriched with their victories gotten on the Persians, are become more pompous in their apparell, and harnes, then they were before: as pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie and riches depraueth people. But as they change their maner of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, so their fortune also will change; and whereas they now beat others, they wil also be beaten: as they haue begun to be, not many yeares sithence, at the battaile which they lost at Lepanto, against the Venetians; which is the greatest aduersitie that euer they receiued, sithence they passed into Europe.</p>
            <p>Likewise, VSVN-CASSANVS was a souldier vnder Tamberlain; who restored this new kingdome of Persia. He being aduertized that there was in his countrie a Lord called <hi>Harduel,</hi> of the race of the Prophet; and the bruit, that ran among the Persians of his holines, and learning, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the law whereof he was a Doctour; and in Astrologie, wherein he meruailously excelled; he gaue him his daughter to wife: of which mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age came the SOPHI ISMAEL. <hi>Harduel</hi> then being more assured and
<pb facs="tcp:13829:110"/>
hartned by this royal alliance, tooke vpon him with the aide of <hi>Techel Cusil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas,</hi> to bring in new expositions and ceremonies into the Alcoran; follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Haly,</hi> who was preferred by them before <hi>Mahomet.</hi> Whereat IACOB the sonne and successour of Vsun-Cassanus being angry; banished him and his sonne: because he feared, that by the fauour of his adherents, vnder co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of reforming the Religion, he aspired to the estate. When the SOPHI (who at the time of his banishment with his father, was but a child) was waxen great, hereturned by force into Persia, setting vp the Sect which was begun by his father, and was afterward left off for feare. And vnder this pretence he drew much people to his part, and conquered in few yeares the Seignorie, not only of Persia; but also of Media, Armenia, and Assyria: finding at his returne <hi>Aleuant,</hi> and <hi>Morat-Champ,</hi> the sonnes of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and his cozins at warre together; whereof thone he slew in battaile; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained thother to flie into Arabia: wherefore he remained peaceable pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessour of of the state. But because his vncle <hi>Iacob</hi> was deceased before he might be reuenged of him, he burned his bodie: Of which inhumaine deed being reprehended by his Mother, he put her to death; or killed her him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. And notwithstanding, was called SOPHI, which is asmuch to say as holie, hauing gotten not by any merite of his owne, but by the goodnes of his father this name, which hath remained to his heires, being reputed heires by the Turkes. This SOPHI by the sodain successe of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests, put all the East in feare; spreding his renowme ouer all the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table earth: To whom the Tartarian Zagathain opposed himselfe, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring continually against him: and Selim Ottoman, who assailed him with a mightie armie, a good waies within his owne kingdome, tooke and spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Tauris</hi> his chiefe Citie; and wan the memorable battaile of <hi>Chalderan:</hi> where<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were slaine many, both of the one side and thother; and the two chiefes were hurt; the Turkes remayning victorious, only by reason of their artillerie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which at that time was vnknowen to the Persians. After Selim defeated in an other battaile the Souldan, who would haue holpen the Sophi; which were the two greatest victories that hapned within these fiue hundred yeares. <hi>Sultan Soliman</hi> following the footsteps of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, returned thither, and got on the Sophi <hi>Damasco</hi> in Assyria, and the imperiall Citie of <hi>Bagdet,</hi> being the auncient seat of the Caliphat of Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea, ouerthrowen by the Tartarians: as also that of <hi>Caire</hi> hath bin distroied by the Souldan. For they which beare the name now in both Cities, haue but the titles, putting the SVLTANS in possession, without medling at all with the state; who doing thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> receiue because of their pretended right three thousand <hi>Seraphes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:13829:110"/>So by the ruine of the Latin kingdome in Hierusalem, and of the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Caliphat, the estate of the SOVLDAN began in Egypt and Suria, insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by Syrracon and Saladine; which was hereditarie, vntil Menescala: who ordained the MAMMELVCS, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst whom it hath long time bin electiue. Neuer was there seen nor heard a more strange or detestable kind of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then that of the MAMMELVCS, being al Christians reheaged, and of seruile condition, which tyrannically commaunded ouer the Egyptians and Surians being free; vsing miserable indignities, and cruelties towardes them. In so much that such power deserued rather to be called seruitude then Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. The MAMMELVCS then were taken when they were little boyes from the countrey of the Circasses, neere to the <hi>Temerinde</hi> or black sea: then brought and sold as slaues into Egypt. Where some selected of them were nourished and hardened vnto paine and trauaile, by continuall exercise of armes: And such as were found to bee the best were enrolled in the order of the Mammelucs, and to them succeeded from hand to hand, not the sonnes of the Mammelucs deceased; but others nourished and chosen after the same maner, to whom pertained the honours and profits of the state; which they deuided among them: not committing the gouernments of prouinces, and conductes of armies, but to those that were experienced, whose vertue was knowen; and who had passed all the military degrees: and by them, and from amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g them, was the SOVLDAN chosen. They held in most straight sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection all the people of Egypt, and of Suria, forbidding them to haue any weapons or to ryde on horsebacke. They were not aboue sixteene thousand; but they intertained many seruants vnder them: and being men of great force, and hardynesse, they had not only tamed many bordering nations, and beaten the Arabians; but also made many warres against the Turkes; enuying their prosperitie; of whome they remained often victorious, and were seldome or neuer vanquished by them. But when as they were deuided, and bandded in partalities, Selim the Turke defeated them in two battailes, killing in the first the SOVLDAN SAMPSON, who was gone into Suria with an armie to helpe the Sophi: then prosecuting his victory, he went into Egypt against him that was chosen SOVLDAN, in steed of him that was dead; whom hee tooke, and made him ignominiously to bee caryed on a poore Camell with his face backwardes all alonge the great streete of <hi>Cair,</hi> and to bee hanged at the gate of that Citie: doubling his power by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of such a state, much reuerenced by those of the religion of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet; and redoubted because of the valyance of the MAMMELVCS, whoe were massacred in suche sorte that there name is almost extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished.</p>
            <p>There remayne yet other great kingdomes of this time as of NARSIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GVE in the Indies; and of PRESBITER IOHN in Africke, called <hi>Lac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Touching PRESBITER IOHN, he commaundeth ouer innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable nations different in colours: and hath vnder him forty kings tributary. His landes and seigniories extende toward the West more then twenty daies iourney; and he hath gold shut vp in a caue, enough to buy the moitie of the world: and the quantity is euery day increased, and multiplied without taking any thing from it. In the spacious kingdome of Ethiopia being so large neuer did the kings sonnes or brothers moue any sedition for the state, nor defiled their hands in one anothers bloud: but the line of the bloud royall is alwaies conserued by rare hap; and neuer yet communicated to any other kingdome whatsoeuer, Christian, Hebrew, Sarazen, or Pagan. They say it was once reuealed to one of their kings in a dreame, that if he desired to haue his kingdome long maintained in peace, and vnity, he must locke vp all his children (which were a great number) on a mountaine; and that he must keep onely him that he would haue to succeed in his kingdome: and this custome remained eternally to his posterity, as a thing ordained of the heauens. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, that one part of Ethiopia (which is so large) would come to reuolt against the heire; and put him in danger of his life, and of his state. The king being awaked was meruailously astonished with this nouelty: not knowing where he might finde this mountaine. Wherefore he had another vision, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealing vnto him that he shoulde marke thorough out al his countrey, where he should see goates, on the top of rockes so high that they seemed readie to f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ll: and this should bee the place where he should shut in his children. Which the king hauing put in execution, the mountaine was found to be of a meruailous height and greatnesse, wherein the children of Presbiter Iohn were locked vp, and carefully kept; for there is no lesse paine to them that come out therehence, or which drawe therehence any of those that are shut vp, then death; hee onely remaining free that ought to raigne by his birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right; or which seemeth the most capable to succeed in that dignity. Those which are shut vp doo neuer come forth, except it so fall out that Presbiter Iohn depart without heires of his body to inherite the crowne. For then they take out him that is next it, whome they know to be the worthiest.</p>
            <p>Also the great KNES or king of Moscouie is a great landed man in the North; whose dominion is about three monethes iourney in compasse of ground<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he possesseth innumerable people, nations, prouinces, duchies, principalities and seigniories; which the Emperours of Moscouia haue got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten one after another by armes, or by other meanes offered them from time to time; as Wolodimeria, Nouingorod, Plescouia, Smolenk, Tuner, Iugaria, Permia, Viakia, Belgaria, the lower Nouogorodia, Ceruigenia, Rozar, Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lokde, Rezomia, Rostomi, Cazan, Ostrakan, and others; which it woulde be tedious to recite because of the rudenes of their names.

He exceedeth in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerity and rigour of commanding all the Monarches of the worlde; hauing gotten such authority ouer his subiects as well ecclesiasticall as secular, that he may dispose at his pleasure of their liues, and goods: no man daring to gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say him in any thing. They confesse publickly, that the will of their prince is the will of God; and that all whatsoeuer he doth, is done by the diuine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence.

By this meanes is he become so mightie, within a little time, that all his neighbours which are the Tartarians, Sueui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Polonians, Liuonians, yea and the Turkes themselues doe redoubt him.

extinguished. Wherin by the industrious perseuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, of diuers learned men, the matter hath had such good successe, that at this day our age may compare with the most learned that euer were. For now we see the tongues restored; and not onely the deeds, and writings of the auncient brought to light; but also many other goodly things newly inuented. Sithence this time Grammar, Poesie, History, Rhetorick, and Logick haue bin beautified with innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble expositions, adnotations, corrections, and translations. The Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks were neuer better knowen; nor Astrology, Cosmography, and Naui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation better vnderstood. Naturall Philosophy and Physicke, were not in greater perfection among the auncient Greekes, and Arabians; then they are at this present. The military armes, and instruments, were neuer so forceable, and impetuous as they are now: nor the dexterity so great in the vse of them. The arts of painting, grauing, cutting, caruing, and building are almost brought to their perfection. And men haue so much laboured in knowledge of Law, and eloquence; that it is not possible, to doe more. The art of Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke gouernement comprehending, and ruling them all (which seemed as it were laide aside) hath lately receiued great light. Moreuer Theology or Diuinity the worthiest of al, which was much obscured by the Sophisters, hath bin very much lightened by the knowledge of the Greeke and Hebrew; and the auncient Doctors of the church, which lay in obscurity in the libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries haue likewise bin brought to light: Vnto which worke the Art of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting hath bin a great helpe; and made the encrease thereof much easier. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then that by course of things, and succession of time we are come to this age, we wil henceforth consider it not by the particular excellencies of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; but by the memorable things done or happened, during this space of time, thoroughout Europe, Asia, Africke, and the New-found lands, in the East, West, North, and South: and by such graces, as it hath pleased God to imparte, to speciall parsons, in this season, thoroughout the seuerall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of the habitable earth.</p>
            <p>And as we haue marked thother ages by some famous warriour, and nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble power that hath bin in euery mutation; so it seemeth that the meruailes of this age ought to begin at the great and inuincible TAMBERLAN, who affrighted the world with the terrour of his name, about the yere of Christ 1400. and by the incredible army which he led of twelue hundred thousand fighting men, trained vnto warlike discipline, got the Empire of Asia: pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing (if the pestilence had not come into his host) to haue gon into Europe: and to haue entierly subdued it, as farre as Spaine; wherehence he woulde haue crossed into Africke; and thorough it haue retourned into Asia. Being then predestined vnto great things, because that in his former pouerty there appeared in him some generosity aboue the rest, he was in sport chosen king of his companions; But he taking it in good earnest (as one that promised already great enterprises in his minde) he tooke oaths of them, &amp; hauing all sworne to doe what he would haue them, and not to forsake him; he made himselfe their Captaine, and commaunded them to leaue their shepheardes

life, as a base thing; and to small purpose, for the getting of glorie and riches; and that they should arme themselues and follow him: That by this meanes they might from that poore and base estate wherein they liued contemptible, come to great &amp; vnlooked for felicity. With this company descending out of the mountains into the plaine countrey, and prospering from day to day; as he increased in Lordship, he augmented in power. First he got the kingdome of his owne countrey; then obtained Parthia, and Persia: On the North side yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to him the Hircanians, Bactrians, Sogdians, Saces; &amp; other innumerable people inhabiting on this side the mountain <hi>Ismaus,</hi> which are called the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. Consequently entering farther into Asia towards the East, he made him selfe Lord of Bythinia, of Pontus, &amp; of al the countrie called at this day Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolia; with the coast of the sea Euxinus, Propontis, Marais, Meotis, and the Cimmerian Bosphorus: Moreouer going on the right hand, he conquered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite townes &amp; prouinces; ouer comming the kings &amp; tyrants which he met withall. And passing his forces ouer the riuer <hi>Tygris</hi> both horse and man, he inuaded the Vxians; whom he subdued, with the Susians: and all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey euen to the Persian sea. From thence going ouer the mountaine <hi>Tauris,</hi> he went into Mesopotamia, then into Media, which he conquered: bringing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, the Cadusians, Armades, Tapirdes, &amp; Circitians. And tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning toward the south, he passed ouer the mountaine <hi>Amanus,</hi> &amp; went down into Suria, &amp; Comagena, bordering on the riuer <hi>Euphrates:</hi> which he ouerran, as far as Arabia, and neer to Hierusalem. He subdued the Lydians, Phrygians, Capadocians, Paphlagonians, Misians, Ionians, Dorians, and Eolians; not lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing finally any people or nation between the hil <hi>Ismaus,</hi> &amp; the Ocean, Caspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, &amp; red sea, vntamed or vnsubdued by armes.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand men: and hauing taken him, caused his hands to be bound be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind his back; and shewed him in that piteous case to his people that were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome; to thend that from that time forth he might be accounted the abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute king ouer all Asia.

This great victory astonied not onely al the inhabitants of Asia, but also the other nations which Tamberlain had neuer troubled, nor meant to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with war: In such sort that the Moscouites being separated by the riuer of <hi>Rha,</hi> from the Tartarians, payed him tribute, and sent him fresh men; The Mossinois, Cercetures, Leucosyrians, and all the nations that are betweene the Caspian sea and the riuer Tanais, yeelded vnto him of their owne free will; and the Corasmians, Dacians, and Sacians, dwelling beyonde the riuer Tanai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And when a certaine Italian (whom for the dexterity which he found in him, he had made of a meane Marchant ouerseer of his reuenewes) admonished him to ioine clemency with his vnmeasurable power, and felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; he answered him with a frowning looke, and sparkling eies; that he was the wrath of God, and the deadly destruction of the depraued age. To ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that intreated him to take pity on Baiazet, who was lately so great a king; he sternely aunswered, that hee did not chastise a King renowmed for many victories: but a cruel and vicious tyrant, who had put to death Solyman his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eldest brother, and depriued him of his Kingdome. And to the Emperour of Constantinople offering him his person, his city, and seigniory, as vnto him, to whom God had adiudged all the Empire of the East; and by whose bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, al men acknowledged Greece to be deliuered from that cruell tyrant Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iazet; he said, that he would not bring into bondage, the most faire, renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and riche citie of all others, which had so lately bin saued out of the handes of the Turkes: Adding moreouer that he was not entred into this war for execrable ambition, or insatiable couetise of conquering countries, or enlarging his dominions; but to the end to succour the Emperour and the Lords of Greece; and to maintaine it in liberty, as he vnderstood it had remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: That the tyrant being taken, and bound, endured the punishement of his wicked deeds, receiuing the same measure which he meaned to haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto others. Moreouer whereas he ouerthrew, and burned all that was between the South and the East; he suffered none to meddle with the temples which he left entier: and for reuerence of their prophet, he entred not into Arabia; moued with some feare of God, and reuerence of the religion. Yet fortune hauing allwaies fauoured him, without euer hauing bin contrary vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; seemeth among so many admirable euents, which exceed the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry course of Conquerours, to haue denyed him an Historyographer of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent learning, and eloquence; agreeable to his vertues: to celebrate them worthily.</p>
            <p>During the raigne of TAMBERLAN, began the restitution of the tongues; and of all sciences. The first that applyed himselfe to this worke was Franciscus Petrarcha, opening the Libraries which til then were shut vp;

for pleasure also, and ornament of this life, hath bin reserued to this age.

By reason hereof, the books which before were rare and deare, are now become more common, and easier to be had: For it seemeth to haue bin miraculously inuented to make learning and good letters to liue againe; which were in a manner dead. The inuention thereof is attributed to the <hi>Germaines,</hi> and began at <hi>Mentz,</hi> therehence it was caried to <hi>Venice;</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes spread ouer all Christiandome; and so brought vnto his perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by Nicholas Genson, Aldus, the Iuntes, Frobenius, Badius, Robert Stephens and others. Notwithstanding the Portugues traficking about the farthest of the East and of the North, into <hi>China, &amp; Catay,</hi> haue brought therehence bookes written in the language, and writing of that countrie: saying, that they haue vsed it there a long time. Which hath made some to thinke that the inuention thereof was brought therhence thorough Tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, and Moscouia into Germany; and so communicated to thother Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: to whom by the diuine prouidence hath bin especially reserued the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation of diuine, and humaine wisdome. The Mahometists depriued of this grace do vtterly reiect printing, not vsing it amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst them, neither suffering any to bring them bookes written of their affaires in Arabian, and printed else-where.</p>
            <p>The second praise ought to be giuen to the inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion of the <hi>Sea-mans com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pas,</hi> consisting of a <hi>Rose,</hi> and a needle of steele, which being touched or rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed with an adamant or loadstone, showeth alwaies the point which is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to the place where wee ymagine the pole Artick. Aristotle vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood not this propertie, nor Galen, nor Alexander, Aphrodiseus, nor Auicen, the most curious obseruers of natural things: For if they had knowen such a miracle of nature, and so profitable a meanes of sayling, they would sure haue made mention thereof in their bookes; hauing stood so much vpon others of much lesse importance. It was also vnknowen to the Romains, who suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red so many shipwrackes, fighting on sea against the Carthaginians: and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Octauian they lost a great fleete of Vessels against Sextus Pompeius. By means hereof al the Ocean hath bin sailed ouer, innumerable Isles found out, and a great part of the continent or maine land discouered towards the west, and the south; vnknowen before of the Ancients; and hath therefore bin cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the new world; and not onely bin ouercome, but also conuerted by the Christians.

Whereof some haue bin swallowed vp into the huge sea, not being yet thoroughly knowen; and others eaten by the Cannibals; leauing a piteous remembrance of their audacious enterprises. But there are three that hauing had more fauourable fortune, haue made famous discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: namely Cortese of the kingdome of Mexico, and of the great Citie The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistiten seated, builded, and peopled, like vnto Venice; Pizairus of Peru, and Cuscu riche in golde; and Magellan of the Moluccaes where the spices grow.

From whence setting saile to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the North, they went to China and Catay; where they made an ende on this side of their Nauigation, entering into amity and confederacy with the great Cham, to thend to haue liberty to traficke with safety in his countrey; which before was not accessible, but with apparant daunger of death vnto strangers: In such sort that by our industry al the world is at this day knowen, wherof a great part that had so long remained vnknowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; &amp; the vttermost parts of the East, West, North, &amp; South do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate togither: the men that are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated with so many seas so distant and different, visiting one another, by meanes of nauigation, being made safer and easier by this Inuention.</p>
            <p>I would willingly giue the third place, to great ORDINANCE, and ARTILERY; (which hath made all other auncient military instruments, and engines of war to cease, al which it exceedeth in impetuosity, violence, &amp; quicknes.) were it not that it seemeth to haue bin inuented rather for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, then the profit of mankind: being an enemy to generous and coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious vertue, which it spareth no more then the rest; but breaketh and bruseth whatsoeuer it encountreth. First it was inuented in Germany by a blower in Alchimie; wherhence it hath bin transported ouer al the world; &amp; seemeth at this day to be brought almost to his perfection; sithence the meanes is found to discharge by volies many pieces togither; which batter, and beat downe al places, how strong soeuer they are in situation, height, or thicknes of wals, &amp; rampires. The Canon at the first was called a <hi>Bombard,</hi> for the noise which it maketh; and <hi>Morter</hi> which was of yron bound with many pieces heauy and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:13829:116"/>
vnweldie; shooting huge bullets of stone, with a great quantitie of powder made of salt-peter; sulpher, and willow coales proportioned: the inuention whereof hath bin no lesse admirable, then of the Canon it selfe. After in steed of yron succeeded brasse; whereof at first were made great peeces laied on wheeles, yet more maniable, then was the mortar; (giuing them bullets of yron) vnto which haue bin guien names of birds, and other liuing creatures, which haue apparance of terrour: as Coleurines, Serpentines, Basilisks, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres, Faulcons, and other appellations imposed according to the diuersitie of their measures, formes, and cariages; at the pleasure of those that made them, or of the Princes which commaunded them. Sithence there haue bin made some lesser, lighter, and maniable, to shoote with bullets of lead: as muskets, caliuers, harquebuzes, pistoles, and pistolets. But because the noise and violence of the Canon, hath bin fitly expressed by the Poet <hi>Fracastorius,</hi> I will here insert his Verses.

            <p>This age hath brough forth many great and notable inuentions: on which notwithstanding I will not stand, because they are rather accessarie to the auncient things; then exceeding the vnderstanding of our forfathers: all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie hauing not any thing to compare vnto these three. But amongst the meruailes of our age, there haue bin manifested new and strange maladies, vnknowen of the Auncients, and not treated of by any Greek, Arabian, or Romain Phisitian: as if there were not enough alreadie dispersed ouer the world, to the number of three hundred, and more; without speaking of the inconueniencies hapning euery day, by the excesses which men do vse.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, there are risen Sects in many Countries, which haue much troubled the publicke peace, and cooled the mutuall charitie of men: Whereof some more curious will attribute the cause to the celestiall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For as we haue obserued in times past, in the notable mutations of
<pb facs="tcp:13829:117"/>
mankind, where nature hath showed her greatest forces: that extreme euill, and wickednes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath met with excellent vertue; and extraordinarie calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties haue accompanied great felicitie: so could not one imagin any kind of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happinesse or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>in afflicted, changed, or destroied; and euery where the Religion troubled with heresies. Not only all Europe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but also the farthest regions of Asia, and Africk; the inhabitants of the new found lands, and of the East and West Indies being innumerable in multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and dispersed into infinite places, haue bin troubled with foreine and ciuile warres, long continued: wherehence hath followed the excessiue price of all things, with often famines and pestilences. We must think that God being angrie with men, sendeth such calamities generally, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, to correct our vices; and to bring vs to a greater knowledge, and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of him: For there was neuer in the world more wickednes, more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie, or more disloialtie; Deuocion is quenched; simplicitie and innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie mocked at; and there remayneth but a shadow of Iustice. All is turned vpside downe, nothing goeth as it ought. But the most notable aduersities and prosperities of this age, are elegantly represented by <hi>Fracastorius</hi> in these goodly Verses.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE excellencie of this age being briefly declared; we will hence forward compare it with the most famous of the former; in matter of Armes, Artillerie, Captaines, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, Battailes, Sieges, Empires, and other States; voiages by sea, and by land, discoueries of Countries, riches, maners, and sciences: to know wherein it is superiour, or inferiour, or equall vnto them; beginning with the comparison of the warfare of these daies with the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Greeke and Romaine. It is said, that CYAXARES king of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians was the first that distributed the men of warre of Asia into Bandes, Squadrons, and Companies; and ordayned that the horsemen and foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men should haue their quarters apart; and should no more march confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly as they were wont to do. The ROMAINS accounting more of their Infanterie, then of their Caualerie; and founding on it all the des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seignes of their power; diuided their footmen into those that were heauily,
<pb facs="tcp:13829:118"/>
and such as were lightly armed, whom they called <hi>Velites:</hi> vnder which word were vnderstood, all such as vsed slings, darts, and bowes; the greatest part of whom (as Polybius saith) were armed with a caske, and to couer themselues, had a shield or target on their arme, and fought without kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping any rank or order, a good way from the heaule, or maine armie. The men that were heauily armed had a salade, which couered their head, and came downe as far as their shoulders. There bodie was armed with cuirasses, which with the tases couered their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>highes, as far as their knees. They had moreouer their leggs, and their armes couered with greues, and vantbrasses, and caried also a shield of fower foote long, and two and a halfe broad; which had a circle or plate of yron aboue, to sustaine the blowes the better, and to keepe it from cleauing; and an other plate of yron vnderneath, which kept the shield from being wasted, and worne, with leaning it on the ground: which might be compared to a pauois, prouided that the pauois had in the verie midst thereof a bosse of yron, well set on, and close ioyned, as their shieldes had; the better thereby to endure the blowes and strokes which should fall thereon. Besides they had a sword girt on their left side, and on their right side a short dagger: They had a dart in their hand, which they called <hi>Pilum,</hi> and threw it when they began their fight. Some w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>te, that besides their pauois, they caried also a pike, namely the Greek souldiers. But that seemeth impossible, because they must needes haue enough to do to help themselues with one of these weapons apart; and to vse them both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether were an vneasie, and a verie difficult thing: for the pike alone requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth both hands; and the pauois on thother side serueth only for defence to couer themselues, because it was not verie maniable. And the target also could not well be handled, but would be in a maner vnprofitable: except at the beginning of the battaile they holp themselues with their pike, hauing their target at their back; and that comming so neere together, that the pike serued them to no farther vse, then they abandoned it to take their Target; wherwith, and with their sword, the souldiers holp themselues in the presse.</p>
            <p>The GREEKS did not lade themselues with such heauie armour as the Romains, but they gaue themselues therwithall much more to carrie the pike; especially the Macedonian <hi>Phalanges,</hi> which carried pikes called <hi>Sarisses,</hi> of ten cubites long; wherwith they assaied to break the rankes of their enemies without going out of their owne. But seeing that the RO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAINS conquered all the world, we may well think that they were the best armed of all.</p>
            <p>The fashion of this time is, to arme the footman with good Curets, and a cask or headpeece: which seemeth to be sufficient for the defence of a man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and is better then the harneis of the auncients. Touching weapons to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, we carrie a sword somewhat longer then theirs: Our other armes are the pike, the halbard, partisan, harquebuze; and many others not so vsuall amongst souldiers; and the target: although there is little reckoning made thereof, except it be for an assault; and besides there are few that vse it but
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:13829:118"/>
the Captaines. The Harquebuze hath bin found out but few yeares sithence; and is verie good, so it be handled by such as are skilfull and readie: yet now adaies, euery one will be a harquebuzier, whether it be to get the more pay; or to be the lesseloden; or els to fight the farther off. The Halbards are a new kind of weapon lately inuented by the Switzers: which are verie good if they be strong, and will cut well; and not light ones such as the Italians vse. And in like sort are their Partisans; which being stronger and better steeled then they are, would serue well against naked men: but against those that are armed can do no great seruice. Amongst other armes which are lesse in vse are the long bow, and the crosbow: which may do verie great harme to men that are not well armed: both by reason of their readines in shooting, which is verie sodaine; and also for the surenes of their blowes, which are seldome in vaine. Concerning the Pike, if the Switzers haue not bin the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentours therof; yet at least wise they haue first brought it in vse: because that they being poore at the first, and desirous to liue in libertie, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to fight against the ambition of the Princes of Germanie; who by reason of their riches and power, intertained many horsemen, which the Switzers could not do; and for this cause made their warres on foote. Then were they constrained (to defend themselues against the Cauallerie of their enemies) to hauerecourse to the auncient maner; and therhence to chose some kind of armes for defence against horsemen: which necessitie, made them either to maintain, or bring in vse againe, the orders of the time past; without which, footmen are altogether vnprofitable: wherefore they took pikes as verie seruiceable weapons, not only to sustaine the assault of men at armes; but also to ouercome them. By meanes of which armes, and by the affiance which they haue in their good order; they haue taken on them such boldnes, that fifteen or twentie thousand of them, durst vndertake to stand against a world of horsemen. The example of the force which these people haue showed to be in armes of footmen, are the cause that sithence the voiage of king Charles the eight, other Nations haue imitated them: namely the Spaniards, and Almaines; then the Italians, and Frenchmen, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the order which the said Switzers keepe, and the maner of the armes which they beare; but for order, there are few like vnto them. We must labour then to gett this order; or if it be possible, to forme or finde out some more safe: by meanes whereof we may defend vs from euery one, and be preferred before all others. To do this it seemeth to such as are most expert in this matter, that we ought verie well to arme the bodies of our souldiers, to the ende that the rankes may be so much the harder to be broken: especially such as serue before in steede of a wall, or vant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure; and all the rest (if it be possible) euery one according to his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon. And it must not be thought strange, that we lode these men with so much Armour; for it is to arme them surely in such sort as they ought to be armed, that meane to stande to it: and not as they which arme them selues lightly; who beeing euill couered and armed, thinke rather
<pb facs="tcp:13829:119"/>
on flying, then of ouercomming: taking example by the Romaines, who armed their souldiers which were ordered in batalions, as heauily as possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly they could, to make them the firmer against their enemies; and that feeling their bodies so loden with harneis, they should not looke to saue themselues by flight; but either to die in the place, or to get the victorie. Vegetius com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playneth of the souldiers of his time, that they went too lightly armed, and followed not the Auncients: which were alwaies wont to ouercome their enemies, because they were euermore well armed; and that such as were ill armed were ordinarily ouercome in all their battailes. The souldiers also must harden their bodies vnto paine, learne to helpe themselues with those armes and weapons which they beare, to keepe their order in marching thorough the Countrie, and the maner of encamping, or lodging together in a campe: which are the principall points that an Armie ought to know.</p>
            <p>The Nations which heretofore haue had ordinances, or companies of footmen, haue alwaies made one principall number of the men which they leuied; which although it hath bin diuersly named, yet hath it bin euer almost equal in number: because they haue all ordained it of six or eight thousand men; which number by the Romains was called a <hi>Legion,</hi> because they le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uied their men by election; of the Greekes <hi>Phalanx;</hi> of the Gaules <hi>Caterue;</hi> of the Switzers and Almaynes <hi>Hourt;</hi> that is to say, a <hi>Battalion:</hi> which the Italians and Spaniards do also vse; But they haue of late began to call it a <hi>Regiment.</hi> The greatest disorder that they can commit which ordaine a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talion, is in this, that they take no heed, but only to make the head strong; in which they place the Captaines, and all the valiantest, and best armed of all the bands; taking no care of prouiding for the back, for the sides, and the innermost rankes: as if the formost rankes were the whole hope of the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; and that the rest serued only to make vp a number. For by this meanes they hazard the whole on two or three rankes; as if they were immortal, or suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient alone to make resistance, without the help of the rest which are behind them: which is directly contrarie to that order which the Auncients obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; which was, to receiue one rank into another, and one battaile into an other; and to fight obstinately euen to the last. For without this maner it is not possible to succour or to defend the first: nor yet by withdrawing them within their rankes, to come to fight in their place.</p>
            <p>With which meane the ROMAINS knew how to help themselues often, and to this end they parted their Legions into three maners of men which were called <hi>Hastarii, Principes,</hi> and <hi>Triarii.</hi> The <hi>Hastarii</hi> made the front, and had their rankes furnished with good store of men. The <hi>Principes</hi> made the second battaile, and were aranged with thinner rankes then the first. The <hi>Triarii</hi> made the third and last; with their rankes so thin, that when need was, they could receiue within them both the former battailes. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer they had their <hi>Velites,</hi> which were lightly armed; who did such seruices as the harquebuziers do with vs: and were placed in the winges between the batalion, and the horsemen. These being lightly armed began the battaile:
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:13829:119"/>
And if it hapned that they ouercame their enemies, they pursued the victorie: but if they were beaten back, they retired into the flankes of the Battalion. After whose retreat, the <hi>Hastaries</hi> or pikemen came to fight with their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and if they found themselues to weake, to withstand them, and that the enemies ouercame them, they retired then by little and little into the thin rankes of the <hi>Princes,</hi> with whom they renewed the battaile. And if it so fell out, that againe they were beaten; then both the one, and the other withdrew themselues within the <hi>Triaries:</hi> with whom they altogether be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the fight a new<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And if these three sorts of souldiers were ouerthrowen, they had then no farther remedie to relieue themselues. Which maner of repairing themselues three times, seemeth to be inuincible: because that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune must thrice abandon vs; and there with also our enemie must fight with vs, and ouercome vs three times.</p>
            <p>The GREEKES with all their <hi>Phalanges,</hi> had not this meanes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing themselues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and although in them they had many chiefes, and many rankes; yet notwithstanding of all together, there was made but one head, and one bodie. And the maner which they had to succour one another, was not to retire the one rankes into the other; as the Romains did: but for one souldier to step into the place of another; and this they did in the maner as followeth. The <hi>Phalange</hi> was ordred by rankes, as is our <hi>Battalion;</hi> yet was it not confusedly: for euery band knew his owne place; and the <hi>Decuries,</hi> that is to say, the chambers or squadrons were aranged in such sort, that the souldiers followed one another; and were in file, and not in front, as we place ours. Whereof the first was called the <hi>Deane,</hi> or <hi>Decurion,</hi> whom we may call the Chiefe of the Chamber; and the last was called the Guide of the back. The second was called <hi>Substes,</hi> and the former <hi>Prestes:</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the rest called on the other <hi>Substes,</hi> and <hi>Prestes,</hi> euen to the said guide, which made vp the end. Of these rankes there were a good many and more; in somuch that one <hi>Phalange</hi> had two hundred fiftie and six men in front: and Lxiiij. rankes in length. True it is that they were diuided vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der fower Colonels: which marched all in front; with certaine spaces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. But let vs put the case, that in each rank there were CCLvj. men, and that they came to encounter with their enemies; if it came to passe that in going, or in fighting, any one of them were slaine or ouerthrowen, he that was in the second rank, and right against the place of the man that was falne, namely his <hi>Substes</hi> est soones aduanced himselfe, and stepped into the place of the former. And by this meanes the men of that rank remayned alwaies complete, and full. And to fill vp the second rank, they of the third namely the <hi>Prestes,</hi> stepped forward, and put them selues into the void pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and those of the fourth furnished the third: and so successiuely, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most at one instant, the latter rankes supplied, and filled vp the former: In such sort, that the first rankes were alwaies whole and entier; and there was no place that remayned voide sauing in the last rank, which consumed it selfe, hauing none behind to fill it vp; in such sort, that the domage which the
<pb facs="tcp:13829:120"/>
first rankes receiued, was the cause of consuming the last: So these <hi>Phalanges,</hi> by meanes of their order might sooner be consumed; then broken: for to ouerthrow them was to difficult a thing, by reason of their great number.</p>
            <p>The Romains vsed <hi>Phalanges</hi> at the beginning, and had their legions also ordered after the Greeke maner; but that order afterwards misliked them: Wherfore they diuided their men into many bodies; as namely into <hi>Cohortes,</hi> and <hi>Manipulos,</hi> accounting that the bodie which had most soules, must haue most life; being also compounded of most members.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Battalions</hi> of the Switzers, Almaines, Frenchmen, and others, do imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate at this time in some part the maner of the <hi>Phalanges</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> aswell in that they arange a great number of men together; as also in that they place them in such sort, that one may step into the place of another. But that this maner is not so good, as that of the Romains; many examples of the Romain legions do tell vs: because that whensoeuer the Romains fought against the Greekes, their <hi>Phalanges</hi> were consumed, and ouerthrowen by the Romain legions; for the difference of the armes, which these Nations did vse, and also the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main maner of relieuing themselues three times, was of more force, then the great number and the soliditie of the Grecian <hi>Phalanges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ordering a BATALION then after all these examples, it were good to retaine in part the armes and fashions of the Greek <hi>Phalanges;</hi> and in part of the Romain <hi>Legions,</hi> and of our modern men of warre: Wherefore in one <hi>Legion</hi> now adaies, there should be three thousand, and fiue hundred ordinarie pikemen, to make the bodie of the <hi>Batalion;</hi> and fower hundred and twentie for the flankes; one hundred and seuentie extraordinarie, for the forlorne hope, which are the armes of the <hi>Phalanges:</hi> Besides the pikemen were requisite fiue hundred Halebardiers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which are weapons found out in our time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and moreouer, CCCCxx. Harquebuziers, for the flankes; DClxxx<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the forlorne hope. The bodie of the Batalion is diuided into ten bands; as the Romans parted their <hi>Legions,</hi> into ten <hi>Cohortes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> The Harquebuziers are ordained to begin the battaile, and for skirmishes; as the Romains had their <hi>Velites.</hi> And as the armes are taken of diuers Nations; so must also these bandes participate with the orders of many sundry people. The men of all these bandes are six thousand, and seuentie: besides which, there ought to be in euery <hi>Legion</hi> a Generall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> chiefe aboue the Captaines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whom they call a COLONEL hauing for his officers these which follow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> namely, a Marshall of the Campe, a Sergeant Maior, a Prouost, and vnder the Prouost, some men of knowledge, to assist him in his iudgements; and to counsaile him concerning matter of Iustice. He must also haue a muster Master, and some Sergeants, and Clarkes of bandes; and a master of high Iustice, or executioner. Moreouer, it is necessarie that the said Colonel, haue one, or two religious Parsons, to say the diuine seruice, and to administer the Sacramentes, to those of his Legion, or Regiment. He must also haue a Phisitian, an Apothecarie, some Surgeons, some ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of fire-workes, and of powder<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and some Armorers. The ouerplus
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:13829:120"/>
to the full number of thirtie, ought to be reserued for his guard.</p>
            <p>The Ensignes at this time serue rather to make a great show of people, then for any militarie vse: but antiquitie vsed them for guides, and to know the better how to bring themselues in order. For euery one as soone as the Ensigne made a stand, knew where his place was about it, and how to put himselfe in it presently. They knew in like maner that if it moued or staied, that they were accordingly, either to moue, or stand still. Therefore it is requisite, that in one Campe there should be many bodies, that is to say, bandes; and that euery bodie haue his Ensigne, to guide those that are of the same bodie: for in hauing it, the campe hath more armes, and by consequent more life. The souldiers then ought to order themselues according to the Ensignes; and the Ensignes according to the sound; which being ordained as it ought, commaundeth the whole Legion: which if it march in such sort, that their places be correspondent to the beating of the Drumms, will easilie keepe this ordinance. And to these ends the Auncients had flutes, and fifes, and sounds perfectly agreeable. For as he which daunceth according to the falles of the Musick doth not erre; so also that Batalion which marcheth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the sound of the Drumme, can not fall in disarray. And therfore when they were disposed to change their place, or according as they listed to kindle, or appea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e, and assure their souldiers, they likewise changed their sound; and as the sounds were variable, so the names of them were diuers. We haue in our time the Drummes for the footmen; and the Trompets for the horsemen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both which instruments haue their seuerall bearings, and sounds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to incourage the souldiers when it is needfull: and to this end are they inuented to commaund<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to make themselues vnderstood a far off. But I beleeue verilie, that the Drummes were also inuented to serue to keepe measure for the souldiers in their marching: for all the times and diuersities of their beatings are true cad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> faile. The Drummes also ought
<pb facs="tcp:13829:121"/>
to be readie to beate, according to the sound of the Colonel his Trompets; by which they are directed in all their beatings. The Colonel his Trompet must be expert in all kind of soundings; and doe them so loude and shril, that he make not one thing vnderstood for another: but know how to expresse as appertaineth, the commaundment of the Colonel; about whom he ought alwaies to be, and neuer to forsake him. The cause why Trompets are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for footmen, is because they be much better vnderstood then the Drummes, if there be a great tumult, and that the sound must be varied: for it is by the Trompets that they are gouerned, whose sound is higher then is the beating of Drummes: Which the Switzers, (who haue bin the inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of Drummes) haue knowen: And for these purposes haue Trom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets before their batalions; by which the chiefes doe signifie what the Batalion is to doe. And it is no long time sithence they vsed great Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netts.</p>
            <p>And forasmuch as the ARTILLERIE is conducted, and garded by the footmen: we will speak thereof, as far foorth as concerneth the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of auncient things with moderne; before we come to intreat of the horsemen, or men of armes. The name of <hi>Artillerie</hi> was before, that <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonrie</hi> was knowen, comprehending all engines of batterie, and defence; which by excellencie, remaineth only to the Canon; all other auncient mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie instruments fayling: as <hi>Balistes, Catapultes, Rammes,</hi> and all others. Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus the Sicilian writeth of an engine of batterie called <hi>Helipolis,</hi> which Demetrius surnamed Poliocritus vsed against the Towne of Salamis in Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus. This engin was Lx. cubits broad of all sides, and Lxxx. in heigth: and therewith had nyne stages, separated thone from thother with plankes of wood; and yet notwithstanding was all sustained with fower great wheeles of one Cubite in height. He had moreouer many engines called <hi>Rammes</hi> to batter the wals: and to succour them two other mightie engines or fences of bordes, couered with hairecloth, or with raw hides, which serued against fire or stones; vnder which they might safely assayle the walls. He placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and in the first storie, many engines to shoote great and heauie stones; in the middle storie, there were other engines shooting long and sharpe shot; and in the highest stories, others shooting lighter shot, and smaller stones: And euery where was a sufficient number of men, to handle and vse those engines; about two hundred in all. Polybius showeth the fashion of an other engine of warre called <hi>Sambucas,</hi> which the Romains vsed against the Citie of Syracusa: &amp; it was after this sort. They had readie in their ship a ladder of fower foote broad, that when they landed, they might set it against the wal; on the sides wherof they fastned things to hold by, and armed it with a couer of defence, setting it a crosse those holds which held the ships together; in such sort, that it stood agood way beyond the fordeck of the ship. To the top of the masts were fastned polies with cordes, &amp; there when necessitie required, they drew those that were at the hind part of the ship by the polies with cordes, to the top of the ladder. Thother also which were at the forcastle, made fast the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:13829:121"/>
engine with stages; and then they drew neere vnto the wall, comming on land by the sayling of the ships, which was easily done by meanes of the two decks made on the outside. At the top of the ladder there was a plank, of a good breadth, and fenced with shieldes: on which fower souldiers got vp, and fought against those which out of the fortresses did hinder the approch of the <hi>Sambuque:</hi> And when as by the approch of the ladder they had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the wall; disarming the sides of their shieldes, they got vp into the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresses, or towers: and the rest followed them by the <hi>Sambuque,</hi> by meanes of the transporting of the ladder, out of one vessell into an other, by the cordes and pullies. Which engine was with good reason termed a <hi>Sambuque;</hi> for when it was so perfected and erected, the figure of the ship, and the lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der together resembled a <hi>Sambuque;</hi> being an instrument of Musick, which we call a Shagboote. The Romains then thought to come to the wall with this engine thus prepared: But Archimedes with other engines, cast from the top of the wall a great stone of the waight of ten kintalls, then a second, and afterward a third, one after an other; which falling on this engine, with a wonderfull thundering and tempest, broke downe all the foundation; dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring, and disseuering those things which ioyned the gallies together, and vpheld it. And going about to come neerer to the wall, to auoide the blowes of the stones, and the shot, which they thought would haue gone ouer their heads, and could not haue hurt them, when they were neere; they were beaten back by other engines, whose cariage was proportioned for all distances: and many holes and arches being neere one an other on the wall, where there were many crosbowes to shoote neere at hand, being in such places, that the enemies without could not see them; when they were about to come neerer, thinking to be vnder couert, and to remaine out of sight, they were all astonished, finding themselues againe receiued with an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of shot, and beaten downe with stones, which fell directly on their heads: for there was no place of the wall, but shot at them. By reason wherof they were constrained to retire back again from the wall; but when they were then farther remoued, the shott, stones, and arrowes, that flew on all sides, found them out, and hit them where they were; in such sort, that there were many men spoiled, and many of their vessels brused, and battered: they not being able to take any reuenge on their enemies; because that Archime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des had prepared the most part of his engines behind and vnder couert, and not vpon the wall. All which inuentions are subtile, and ingenious: but yet not comparable to the Canon in these daies; which breaketh and battereth whatsoeuer it encountreth.</p>
            <p>I come now to the CAVALERIE, which is vsed diuersly in diuers Regions. Some vse that called of the Auncients, <hi>Cataphracte</hi> of barded hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses with lances, and curtelasses; Others vse light horses with swordes and pistoles; And others ryde naked or vnarmed, with short lances, as horsman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staues, or bowes and arrowes, or harquebuze. The Cataphracte Caualerie of France, hath alwaies bin much regarded, carying the name aboue all others,
<pb facs="tcp:13829:122"/>
both for exploit, and equipage; and especially sithence the time of king Charles the seuenth: who reduced it to a certain number of lances, and men of armes, of his ordinances, ordinarily paied, and continually exercised in armes, being diuided into garrisons in his frontier places. He diuided them into bands, and companies, furnished with Captains, Lieutenants, Ensignes, Guidons, men of armes, Marshals of the lodgings, quarter Masters, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingers; treasorers of the warres, and paymasters of companies, commissaries, and controllours: committing the charge of them to chosen Lords of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and magnanimitie: as to the Constable, and Marshals of France; and other men of qualitie.</p>
            <p>The MAMMELVCS being taken the most of them out of the countrie of <hi>Circasse,</hi> were instructed by Masters of fence, and continually exercised in armes; hardning them to labour, to honger, and to thirst, and to lie on the ground; or on some poore peece of tapistry. They which were found the most valiant, were inrolled in this order; receiuing from that time forward good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, and salarie. Wherefore hauing no other care, but of armes; and being strong of disposition, and accustomed from their infancie vnto paine; they gaue themselues the chiefe praise for warre, aboue all other Nations: thinking that there were not in the world any, whom they could not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by armes.</p>
            <p>The PERSIANS are Cataphractes, hauing strong barded horses; and are verie valiant men of armes: in such sort, that fiue and twentie thousand of them, do not feare a hundred thousand Turks; which fight vnarmed vpon light horses. The Nobilitie of the countrie are bound to go to the warre, by the fees, and vnderfees which they possesse; as in France, Spaine, Lombardy, Naples, England, Germanie, &amp; Poland: and to find a certain number of armed men, according to the reuenew of their lands which they hold, either by suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession from their parents; or by benefit of the Prince. The richer sort are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly verie well armed; the others content themselues with salets, and coates of mayle: and being couered with shields, they fight somtimes with the lance, and sometimes with the bow. Those of <hi>Scyras</hi> are accounted the best; then the Assyrians; with whom are mingled, the Medians, and Parthians the best archers of Asia after the Tartarians. The ARMENIANS like better to fight on foote, and are ordered in batalions; fortifying themselues with great pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoises, pitched in the ground against their enemies: vsing short pikes, &amp; axes, and slings. Their allies are the Georgians, &amp; Mengrelles; which are Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans after the Greeke maner; and reputed most warlike.</p>
            <p>There is great reckoning made of the ALBANESES of Greece, of the HOVSSERONS of Hongarie, &amp; of the REISTERS of Germanie. But the Turks at this day seem to be the chief warriours, hauing ouercom the French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the battail of Nicopoli; ouerthrowen the Mammelucs; &amp; vanquished the Persians in their owne Countrie; subdued the Albaneses, and the Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garians; entred, &amp; wasted Germanie. Wherof none ought to wonder, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their discipline, in the which they haue many things most co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:13829:122"/>
obserued with Iustice and seuerity; in such sort that they excell therein the auncient Greeks, and Romains. The first is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, nor cards, nor any other plaies of hazard, for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: neither do they blaspheme God in any sort; but name him at al times with great reuerence. The two cases which they punish most greeuously are quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, and thefts. Marching thorough the countrey in the summer season, they dare not for their liues to go amongst the come, &amp; spoil it. They despise death, thinking that it is predestinate vnto euery man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the day of his death writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his forehead; which it is not possible to auoid: which maketh them more bold and aduentorous; as also the punishment &amp; recompence which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent for them that do well or euil. For whereas punishment, and reward, doe vphold al co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weals (as Solon said) &amp; honor, &amp; reproch are the two wings of vertue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> presently amongst them after the fight is done, he that hath acquited himselfe wel, is rewarded by increasing of his pay; and he that hath done euill hath his head cut off; or els remaineth for euer dishonored. They neuer lodge in the townes; neither when they come neer them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do they permit any to goe lye there; for feare of iniuries and seditions: obseruing military discipline very strictly; to thend, that while they are in ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe, they be not vsed vnto delicacies, which in times past haue destroied mighty kingdoms; and corrupted the most warlike Nations. Moreouer to auoide ydlenes, the Othoman Princes haue accustomed, from two yeres to two yeres, to make wars in some place; to the end to exercise their men of war: which otherwise being dispersed here and there in the prouinces would consume, and come to be of little worth: There is no nation with whom the Turkes haue had any different, but they alwaies ouer came them; besides the Tartarians. Notwithstanding although the great Seignior aboundeth in men, and in all things requisite for warres, more then any other Monarch of our time; yet for all that he aduentureth nothing rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and obtaineth more victories by dexterity, and taking opportunities, then he doth by force.

All the Turkes goe, with such courage, order, and alacrity to the warre, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when it is for defence of their religion; that when they assemble to go thither, one would thinke they were rather going to a mariage, then to the campe. Scarsely, and with much a doo will they stay for the prefixed time of marching but doe commonly preuent it. It dislyketh them much to remaine at rest without warr; accounting themselues happy when they die not in their houses, amidst the teares of their wiues; but in fight amongest the Lances, and arrowes of their enemies: not lamenting for the losse of those which die in that maner; but reputing them holy, and praying for them in all their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies.

When AMVRATH the second, (whome they account a Saint, and who was very valiant and fortunate in armes) went to the Temple to praier, he went out of his palace without any pompe, accompanied onely with two seruants; and woulde not bee saluted nor flattered with accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations: and being in the Temple had no heauen spred ouer him, nor any other magnificence; and before he died gaue ouer the Empire to his sonne, and withdrew himselfe to a religious solitarines. Hee was affable in speach, wise in iudgement, and liberall in almes. His sonne MAHOMET had very fauorable fortune; resembling Alexander the great, in courage, in witt, and desire of glorie. Hee tooke Constantinople by assault at the age of twentie and two yeares: And complayned notwithstanding that Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander at the same age, with so little power, had conquered the Empire of the worlde: and hee which had no lesse hart, then he, and was so mightie in men, in horses, armes, and reuenewes, could not haue his will of one part thereof; although that by his great deeds he got the title of great vnto his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>family.

               <p>ALthough TAMBERLAN were no Kings sonne as was Ninus, yet notwithstanding by especiall fauour of the heauens he attained to the whole Empire of Asia, as thother had done; and led an armie not much lesser then his.

Attila was fatal to Europe, and the West; Alexander and TAMBERLAN to Asia, and the East; Iulius Cesar to the common wealth of Rome, Hannibal to Italy, and the countrie of Lybia. TAMBERLAN brought the Turks to a piteous state; out of which they soone arose, and became more mighty then before: as the Greekes and Romaines oppressed by Xerxses and Hannibal; when they thought themselues vtterly ouerthrowen, came to greater glory.</p>

               </head>
               <p>IT is mencioned in the holy scripture how Nabuchodonosor saw an Image of an exceeding greatnes; the head whereof was of gold, the brest and armes of siluer, the belly and thighes of brasse, the leggs of yron, the feete part of yron, and part of earth: And when he was awaked, because he could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his dreame, and yet founde himselfe sore troubled and fryghted therewith, hee called togither his deuinours before him; whom he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to expound vnto him what his dreame was, and the meaning thereof:
<pb facs="tcp:13829:125"/>
and if they failed herein, he threatned to put them to death. Which being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood by Daniel a yong man that had bin brought thither as a Captiue from Hierusalem, he made it knowen that he could fulfill the kinges desire; and being presented to the king, he declared first what the king had dreamed; and then interpreted the meaning of his dreame: saying, that the Image signified the foure soueraigne Empires of the world, which should succeed in order one after another; namely the Babylonian, Persian, Greeke, and Romain. Thereupon he spake vnto the king in such termes; <hi>Thou art certainly the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den head of this Image; thou I say whom God hath decked with supreme power, and glorie; to whom he hath giuen dominion ouer all men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ouer the beastes of the field and the birds of the aire. And after thee shall come another kingdome of sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, that is to say, worse then thine which is present; The third shall be of brasse which shall be stretched out farr and wide: the fourth of yron, for as yron bruseth and ouercommeth al things, so likewise this fourth shal bruse all the rest, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due them to it selfe.</hi> The power of Nabuchodonosor is compared to a high tree reaching vnto heauen, and couering the vniuersall world with the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow thereof; whose leaues are singularly faire, and the fruit so plentiful, that all beastes are fed and fatted therewith: In whose boughes and branches all sorts of birdes do build their nestes, and make their resorte. Whereby the scripture signifieth the Assyrian Monarchie, which was augmented vnder this King, and exalted to the highest. Daniel also sawe in a dreame foure beastes comming out of the sea, a Lyon, a Beare, a Leopard, and the fourth being terrible and horrible to behold. The Lyon signifieth the raigne of the Assyrians; and the two winges which hee giueth him are as the two members of this Empire, Babylon and Assyria. By the Beare is meant the kingdome of Persia, by which that of Babylon was destroyed: The three ribbes which he sayth were betweene his teeth, are the principall Kings of this Monarchie, Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes, excelling aboue the rest; which haue eaten much flesh; that is to say, haue ioyned many nations to their dominion. The Panther or Leopard is the Empire of Alexander the great, or of the Grecians: The foure winges and heades are the foure king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, issued out of this Monarchie after the death of Alexander. The fourth and last beast is the Romain Empire: the ten hornes are the members or parts thereof, Syria, Egypt, Asia the lesser, Greece, Africke, Spayne, France, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Germany, and England: for the ROMAINS ruled ouer all these Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Amongst these ten hornes ariseth and groweth vp another little horne, which taketh away three of the otherten; whereby is vnderstood, the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of MAHOMET or of the TVRKES: which being risen from a small beginning in the Romaine Monarchy, hath seized the three princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall partes thereof; Egypt, Asia, and Greece. Moreouer this little horne hath eies, and is iniurious against God; for Mahomet proposed new Doctrine, hauing the appearance of wisedome; which is signified by the eies: and yet notwithstanding blasphemeth God, abolishing the Christian doctrine, and outraging of his Saincts; vntil such time as the Auncient which hath neither
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:13829:125"/>
beginning nor ende, commeth vnto Iudgement. Whereby is euidently to bee vnderstood, that the course of this world, shal end in this Empire; &amp; that there shal not folow any other. But that al principalities of the world being aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, that euerlasting kingdome shal come, whereof CHRIST is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and conductour. Thus haue some Diuines expounded Daniel.</p>
               <p>Others accommodate it onely vnto Babylon; which fell vnder the domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Persians, Medes, Greeks, and Parthians; which hath bin often deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and finally ouerthrowen; not thinking it good to reduce all Empires vnto foure; considering there haue bin others of great power, and largenes. As of the Medes, who supplanted the Assyrians; of the Parthians which ouercame the Macedonians, &amp; oftentimes vanquished the Romains; &amp; as hauing parted the world with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, obtained the East, &amp; ruled al Asia between the red sea, and the Caspian; &amp; a good way toward the Indies: Of the Egyptians, whose kings excelled in praise of valiancy, &amp; deeds of armes al other nations; which would blot out &amp; deface, the great &amp; excellent victories of the Persians, Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, &amp; Romains; if the long course of yeres would permit their renown to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure till this time, the rest no way surpassing them, but in the happines of their Historiographers (who are more read) &amp; by a fresher memory of their anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie; Of the Arabians or Sarasens, which possessed Persia, &amp; Babylon, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying the Romain Empire in the East; and enioyed a great part of Asia, Africke, and Europe; planting there not onely their armies and seigniories, but their religion also, and their tongue: Of the Gothes who inuaded not onely the prouinces of the Romaine Empire in the West, but tooke, and sacked Rome the seate of the Empire; raigning in Italy lxx. yeres: although Alexander who ouerthrewe the kingdome of the Persians, raigned but twelue yeares; who like a lightening thunder leaped into diuers parts, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his state to many successours disagreeing amongst themselues who lost it incontinently: Finally of the Tartarians who may be compared with all the former; who won Bactriana and Sogdiana; the prouinces of the Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonian, Persian, and Parthian Empire; and destroied Babylon it selfe vnder the conduct of their Lord Halao.</p>
               <p>At this day there are great estates, namely toward the East: Of Cathay or of China, in the Northren India; and of Narsingue in the Southern, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the Persian is neere: That of the Moscouite in the North, and the Abys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin or Ethiopian in the south. In the West the Spanish, and French. The Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish is as it were in the middest of all very great and riche: which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing is not to be compared to that of the Romaines, who ruled from the Orcades and Thule on the one side; Spaine, and Mauritania on the other; as far as the hill Caucasus, and to the riuer Euphrates, and the higher Ethiopia; trauersing the countrey of Egypt and of Arabia, euen to the East sea: their Empire hauing bin almost the onely one that hath vntill this present made the East, &amp; West, the North, and South, their limits; hauing endured xij. hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeres longer then any other kingdome or common wealth, which hath bin either before or sithence, except the Assyrian. For the Turkes hold little in

Africk, &amp; nothing in Italy, Spaine, France, Germany, &amp; England; neither yet passing toward the East &amp; the south, the auncient bounds of the Romains.</p>
               <p>The common wealth of VENICE being principally <hi>Aristocratical;</hi> by the senate, and colledge of wisemen, hath these parts so well tempered togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and proportioned, that it hath bin a long time preserued from sedicions within it selfe, and mutations, which at leastwise were of great importance; and outwardly hath maintained it selfe against the assault of many mighty princes: hauing already continued aboue twelue hundred yeres, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny violence of inward wars, and without falling vnder the yoake of any fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne power, or changing the first ordinance wherein it was founded. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny auncient common weales haue exceeded it in greatnes of Empire, in mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie discipline, and renowme of great exploictes: But there is none to bee compared to it in gouernment, and lawes for good, and happy life; neither any to be found that hath raigned so long; no not among the auncients, the Romaine, Carthaginian, Rhodian, Athenian, Lacedemonian, and Marsilian; or amongst those of later age, the Florentine, Senoise, Lucoise, and Genuoyse: the state being in deed gouerned in the most accomplished communalty, that hath bin seen or red of. The <hi>Democratie</hi> of the SWITZERS likewise is well tempered by the counsailes established in euery Canton; which preserue it from such vices and inconueniences, vnto which the common people are most ordinarily subiect; &amp; haue made it to prosper hitherto. And in as much as there are mongst them thirteene cities confederate; they represent the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient leagues of the Toscans, Ionians, Eolians and Acheians: which exceeded not much the number of twelue or thirteene townes. For being come to such a number that they haue meanes to defend them selues, they endeuour not to increase their state: as wel because that necessity constraineth them not to seeke to get greater power; as also because that being common in their conquestes they make no lesse reckoning of them; &amp; that otherwise by augmenting in so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties &amp; confederacies, the multitude would come to some confusion.</p>

               <p>SOme nations are better by land; and others by sea. Polybius writeth of the CARTHAGINIANS, that they were best on the sea, and could there best furnish an equippage, for as much as this exercise was hereditarie, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient vnto them, and that they traficqued on sea more then any others: but that the ROMAINS holpe themselues best with their footemen; &amp; gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues wholy vnto it. The Phenicians, Cilicians, Egiptians, Rhodians, &amp; Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silians were in times past much esteemed for marine matters. The situation of VENICE is more fit for warre by sea then by land: seeing that one could not there in any sort accommodate any companies of horsemen; or bandes and squadrons of footemen. Moreouer the most simple, and couragious
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:13829:126"/>
nations seeke not to fight but by prowes, and vertue; blaming all subtelties, and surprises: such as the Gaules &amp; Heluetians were in old time. The others as the Greekes, Spaniards, Persians, Egiptians, and Africans which are crafty, and cautelous of nature, care not by what meanes they get the aduantage on their aduersaries: not thinking any kind of deceight to be reprochful against the enimies; so that they ouercome them. And therefore they do ordinarily vse ambushes to entrap him; and do rob and spoile their townes at vnawares: endeauouring to vanquish them by skirmishes, and sodaine surprizes, when they find them vnprouided; rather then by battailes determined, and prepared at a prefixed day. Polybius saith that the Cretenses or Candians are the nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest people of the worlde, both by sea, and by land, for ambushes, robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and spoiles; for surprises by night, and all maner of deceipts: but that in a pitched field they are feareful, and cowardly without seruice; vnto whom the Acheians, and Macedonians are quite contrary. Iustin telleth of the Parthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that by flying or running away they deceiued their enimies; and that when one would think them to be ouercome, they were the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> most dangerous. The Turkes (who are reckoned so mighty) get more victories, by policie, and opportunity; then by force: neuer aduenturing or hazarding battaile, but to their aduantage.</p>
               <p>Concerning armies; Asia at all times by reason of the vnmeasurable large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes thereof hath bin most populous; and therfore hath set forth armies of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible greatnesse, and power: as we haue said of Ninus, who led an armie of seuenteene hundred thousand footemen, two hundred thousand horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ten thousand and sixe hundred chariots, armed with hookes: Of Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramis his wife who went into India with thirtie hundred thousand foote, fiue hundred thousand horsemen, a hundred thousand chariots; and made a bridge on the riuer of <hi>Inde</hi> of two thousand boates: of Cyrus; who gathered togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sixe hundred thousand footemen, and sixescore thousand horsemen, with two thousand armed chariots: Of Darius the first; who assailed the Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, with eight hundred thousand fighting men: Of Xerxes going into Greece; who had by sea fiue hundred seuenteene thousand men, and by land a Million, seuen hundred thousand footemen, and fourescore thousand hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; with twenty thousand Arabians, and Africans: vnto whom there ioined of Europe three hundred thousand: the whole multitude comming to two millions, sixe hundred and seuenteene thousand fighting men. Attila in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope assembled fiue hundred thousand men of warre; on horsebacke, and on foote. We wil compare TAMBERLAN vnto them, who had togither and entertained long twelue hundred thousand souldiers: and those which haue diminished this number, yet gaue him no lesse then sixe hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand footemen, and foure hundred thousand horse. The two greatest armies, which haue bin seene in the West by land; within these thousand yeres, were that of Sultan Soliman when he came the second time to <hi>Vienna,</hi> and of the Emperour Charles the fift, going to defend it against him. Where if they had fought, the question had not bin only of <hi>Vienno,</hi> but of the Empire almost of
<pb facs="tcp:13829:127"/>
all the world: to bring it into his ancient estate. But the winter comming on, they parted without doing any thing worthy of remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, fearing one the other. In the Turkes armie there were fiue hundred thousand fighting men; and of Artillery, three hundred field pieces. In that of the Emperour xc. thousand foote, and thirtie thousand horsemen; Almaignes, Flemings, Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians, Polaques, Hongarians, Spaniards, Italians, Bourguignons, Namurois, and Hannoniers; with incredible preparation of al sorts of artillery: the whole number of all those that were in the armie when it was full, comming to cclxxx<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thousand parsons. The other militarie assemblies that haue bin seene in the West of long time, do resemble robberies, or playing at barriers, rather then true warres (if we beleeue Blondus Flauius the Historiographer) mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie discipline being all obserued in these partes; and men effeminated by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightes; and blynded by their mutual and friuolous dissentions, diminishing from day to day their valiancy and reputation.</p>
               <p>As touching battailes, Herodotus affirmeth that of all those which were euer fought by the Barbarians, the sharpest and most furious, was betweene TOMYRIS the Queene of the Massagetes, and CYRVS: where was ouerthrowen a great part of the Persian armie, and Cyrus himselfe slaine. Xenophon reckoneth for great battailes, those two which Cyrus obtained against the Assyrians and the Lydians; in which thone King was slaine, and thother taken. We may also put amongst the principal battailes, those three which ALEXANDER wan of DARIVS King of Persia; Those which were betweene SCIPIO, and HANNIBAL; and betweene POMPEY and CESAR at <hi>Pharsalia:</hi> Between ATTILA king of the Hunnes on the one part, and the Romaines Frenchmen and Gothes on tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the playne of <hi>Chaalons,</hi> where remained a hundred and fourescore thousand parsons in the place: That which CHARLES MARTEL had at <hi>Tours</hi> against the Sarazens, where were slaine three hundred and three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score thousand. Vnto which wee may compare that which TAMBER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAN gaue to BAIAZET OTTOMAN, where were slaine two hundred thousand Turkes: AMVRATH to LANCELOT King of Poland and Hongary, at <hi>Varne;</hi> where he was slaine: The two which SE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIM got on the SOPHI at <hi>Calderan,</hi> and on the SOVLDAN in <hi>Suria:</hi> the most renowmed that were fought these thousand yeres.</p>
               <p>The most memorable auncient sieges of places are, that of TROY by the Greekes, where they continued ten yeres, and in the end tooke it in the night time by deuice: of BABYLON by Cyrus, and by Darius: of MES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SENE by the Lacedemonians; where they remained likewise ten yeres: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing bound themselues by oath not to depart, til they had taken it. Herodotus writeth that <hi>Psamneticus</hi> king of Egypt, held AZOTVS a citie of <hi>Suria</hi> be sieged for the space of ninteene yeres; and was so obstinate in his purpose that he would not depart til he had taken it: The same Authour saying, that of all the townes that he had euer knowen, it had endured the longest siege. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer Alexander besieged Tyre, Marcellus Syracusa; Hannibal Sagunt;
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:13829:127"/>
Scipio, Carthage, and Numantia; Numantius, Corinth; Iulius Cesar, Vxel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodun, Alexia, Auaric, Gergobie, and Marseilles; Vespasian, and his sonne Titus, Ierusalem; Alaricus, Attila, and Gensericus, Rome. Wee may put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the new sieges, which we will compare with the auncients, that of CONSTANTINOPLE by Mahomet, accompained with two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand Turkes: who tooke it by assault, when hee was but two and twentie yeres old: of GRANADO by king Ferdinand, and Queene Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, where they continued seauen yeres before they could take it on the Moores: of RHODES by Sultan Soliman, compassing it with three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand men, who finally obtained it by composition: of BELGRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DO at the entrance of Hongary, a very strong citie; and of MALTA also by him, which he coulde not take, although his men did their vttermost: but conquered Signet in Hongarie when he died. It is not long sithence Florence sustained a siege a whole yeare togither, before the common wealth was brought into a Dukedome.</p>
               <p>But the sieges of Rhodes and Malta were more by sea, then by land, and may be compared to the sieges of Tyre, Syracusa, Carthage, Numantia, and Marseilles: which in like maner were rather on sea, then on land. The battaile by sea which the VENETIANS got not long sithence of the Turkes doth not yeld any whit to the most renowmed of the auncients: as that of the ROMAINS against the ARMORICANS that of DEMETRIVS the sonne of Antiochus king of Suria, and PTOLOMEY king of Egypt; Betweene PHILIP king of Macedonia, and ATTALVS king of Pergamus; betweene OCTAVIVS CESAR, and MARCVS ANTONIVS before <hi>Actium:</hi> It is true that the ancients were more mighty by sea then wee: but for want of vnderstanding and skill in nauigation they made infinite ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrackes, and receiued inestimable losses. The onely citie of Athens kept som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times three hundred gallies. And nowe the Turke who is so riche, and so mighty cannot rig forth, set to sea, and maintaine so many. Xerxes when hee went into Greece had three thousand vessels. Alexander when he died caused a thousand to be prepared to go into Africk, and to assaile Carthage. The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, and Carthaginians in the warres which they had long time togither lost an infinite number of ships. Dionise the tyrant of Syracuse had foure hundred vessels with oares.</p>
               <p>Moreouer the auncients made gallies of v. vj. vij. viij. ix. &amp; x. oares in a seate, yea euen to xxx. Those of this time are but of iij. and at Venice it hath bin a difficult thing to build one of fiue oares. These fiue hundred yeres the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, and Genuoises haue bin Maisters of the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> sea, and haue fought sharpely thereon one against the other, for the chiefe superintendance thereof: The Venetians at length haue had the better, and are mighty theron at this day. In the Ocean the Portugales, Castilians, and Englishmen by dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teritie, knowledge, and skill of nauigating hold the chiefe commendation in this exercise: hauing excelled the Tyrians, Egyptians, Phenicians, Rhodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Romaines, Carthaginians, Marsilians, Armoricians, and all others that
<pb facs="tcp:13829:128"/>
euer medled with long voiages, and discoueries of landes that were before vnknowen; hauing gon round about the world by their nauigations: which the auncients neuer did, nor could, or durst vndertake to doe.</p>

               <head>A COMPARISON OF THE RICHES <hi>of the time present, with that of the times past.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT is certaine, that this age hath bin much enriched and accomodated with many new things, seruing not only for necessitie, but also for pleasure, ornament, and magnificence; by the foresaid nauigations, and discoueries: For besides the sugers, pearles, spices, strange and medicinable herbes, trees, and fruites; there haue bin found many mynes of fine Gold towards the South; especially in the countrie of PERV, where all the vessell, and vten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siles of houshold, are of gold: which hath bin brought into Spaine, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed afterwards ouer all Europe. But there is no smal difficultie in iudging whether the riches of this time, be comparable to that of the time passed. For it seemeth that the Auncients were richer, when we call to memorie the vnmeasurable quantitie of gold, which SARDANAPALVS the last king of the Assyrians consumed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at his departure out of the world; the riches of the kings, MIDAS, and CRESVS; of PYTHIAS the Bythinian, who at his owne charges feasted the Armie of Xerxes, and presented him with a great Vine of gold; the great treasures found by ALEXANDER in the conquest of Persia. The abundance of gold that was in <hi>Iewry,</hi> in the time of SALOMON; the excessiue expenses of ANTONIVS and CLEOPATRA; the wealth of CRASSVS a Citizen of Rome, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting no man rich, if he could not intertaine an Armie with his reuenew: the spoiles which IVLIVS CESAR got in the Gaules; and the giftes which he gaue vnto many, to draw them to his side: The prodigalitie of the Emperours, Claudius, Caligula; and Nero: The possessions of Pallas, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listus, and Narcissus bondmen; And of SENECA the Philosopher: who being but priuate men, exceeded the publike reuenew of many kings, at this day accounted to be verie rich. Notwithstanding we vnderstand, that the great CHAM of Cathay, and PRESBITER IOHN, vse a kind of husbandrie neuer before practized, togather gold and siluer vnto them, and to keepe that, which they haue gathered; &amp; do continue togather, in so great quantitie, that they haue enough to buy all the rest of the world: For thone, not vsing money made of any Mettall, but either peeces of paper, or the rinds of Mulberie trees, marked with his Emperial marke; The other, graines of salt, or pepper cornes, (which they cause to be valued as money) they draw to themselues all the gold, and siluer of the Countrie; and cause it to be melted, and then lock it vp in strong places, without diminishing of it at any time: In such sort, that they seem to exceed in wealth, all other Princes, both auncient &amp; modern, that were euer renowmed for their riches. The kings of PERSIA were not so good husbands, which gaue money his course to and fro, both of gold, &amp; siluer in their Countrey, &amp; that which they drew vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, they caused to be melted &amp; cast into earthen barrels; and when the vessels were ful, they made them to be caried vp &amp; down to follow their Court; &amp; when they
<pb facs="tcp:13829:129"/>
had any need, they broke as much as they had vse of. They say that the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new of the great SIGNOR, amounteth to twelue or fifteen Millions of gold; wherwith he intertaineth so many men on horseback, and on foote, by land and by sea, in his Court, and on his frontiers; which do neuer want their pay: and yet notwithstanding, by good husbandrie laieth vp euery yeare great store of gold and siluer, in his treasure house, and in the seuen towers of Constantinople. Of long time there hath not bin any Lord richer vnder the degree of a King, or an Emperour, then COSMVS de MEDICIS, the first of that name being a Florentine.</p>

               </head>
               <p>IT is an old complaint, that maners waxe euery day worse and worse. If it were so, then men should ere this haue come to the heigth of iniquitie; and there should now be no more integritie in them: which is not true. But we must think that there is a vicissitude, and an interchangeable course be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween vice and vertue; which arise and fall by turnes, and are oftentimes opposed one against an other, as contraries: that they may be the better knowen, and more easilie discerned. <hi>Inest enim rebus omnibus quidam velut crbis, vt quemadmodum temporum vices, ita morum vertantur: nec omnia apud priores meliora (inquit Tacitus) sed nostra quoque aetas multa laudis et artium, lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danda posteris tulit.</hi> It is credible, that this complaint hath first proceeded
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:13829:129"/>
from old men: who hauing passed the flower of their age (which was full of ioy, and gladnes) when they come to their extreme old age (wherin is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but sorow, and sadnes,) they wish againe for the pleasures of youth; seeing their sences become feeble; and all their members weakned. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times also being dispised or neglected of those that erst had honoured them; and deceiued by a false opinion which they haue of things; they think there is no faith, nor friendship, nor honestie, remayning among men: telling to the yonger sort many wonders of their former age. To whom it hapneth no otherwise then it doth vnto those, that embarke themselues on the sea, and beginning to saile, according to the measure as they are distant from land, it seemeth vnto them, that the bank, or shore, the hills, trees, and houses do leaue them: thinking in like maner that in their old age, both pleasure, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie, and iustice do forsake them, and vanish away. Moreouer, those which are extremely vicious, being not able to go any farther, nor yet to stand at a stay wherethey be; are constrained to returne by little, and little, either for shame (which is naturally in men) or els for necessitie; because that in such manifest wickednes, they are eschewed of all men: or els by the diuine prouidence; which bringeth them back againe. For in the auncient histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are found such execrable vices, as there can not be more; which haue raigned for a time, and haue afterwards bin detested: in whose place haue suoceeded most commendable vertues. Whereon we will resolue with <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca,</hi> speaking thus to this purpose. <hi>Hoc maiores nostri questi sunt (ait) hoc nos querimur, hoc posteri nostri queruntur; euersos esse mores, regnare nequitiam, in deterius res humanas, et in omne nefas labi: At ista stant loco eodem, stabunt que paululum duntaxat vltro citroque mota; vt fluctus quos aestus accedens longius ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulit, recedens maiore littorum vestigio tenuit.

and therefore the more admirable. To the attayning whereof, there is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site a happie nature, a laborious diligence, &amp; a constant perseuerance; which must be aduaunced, honoured, and rewarded by the Princes: who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing commonly haue small care of learning, and fauour it slenderly. The students, if they be poore, they applie themselues to questuarie, or gainfull arts; wherby to haue meanes to liue, when they haue reasonably profited in them. The rich giue themselues to pleasure, seeking the easie and superficial apparance; and not the painfull profoundnes, and depth of knowledge. The greatest part of Teachers vse but rehersings, and repetitions by rote, acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themselues lightly of their charges. They which write for the most part, do nothing but tye together, and all heape one on another Grammars, Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toricks, Logicks, Institutions, Introductions, Abridgements, Annotations, Corrections, Translations, Epistles, Orations, Eclogues, Dialogues, Common places, Elegyes, Odes, Vulgar rymes, and such other versifications. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, we must learne out of bookes in the schooles, the Latin, Greek, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, Chaldiack, and Arabian; which were mother tongues amongst the Auncients, &amp; they learned them from their cradle, when they began to speak: In which we must now consume much time, and the best of our age; which were better emploied in the knowledge of things, and vnderstanding of the sciences. Besides there is one inconuenience in learning, which is not smal; that they are all their life time brought vp in the shadow of schooles, without knowing of their behauiour amongst men; and without hauing experience of matters; although knowledge without practize be vnperfect. Which is the cause that we haue not at this day such eminent persons in <hi>Philosophie,</hi> as Pythagoras, Thales, Plato, Aristotle, and Theophrastus; In <hi>Eloquence,</hi> as Demosthenes, and Cicero; In <hi>Phisick,</hi> as Hippocrates, Galene, and Auicen; In <hi>Law,</hi> as Seruius Sulpicius, Papinian, and Vlpian; In <hi>Historie,</hi> as Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Thucydides, Polybius, Salust, Liuie, and Tacitus; In the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> as Euclide, Eudoxus, Archimedes, and Ptolomeus: albeit there haue bin in them verie excellent men of this age. For sithence they were extinguished in Egipt, and left off by the Greeks, and Arabians; they were neuer more famous then they are at this present: especially <hi>Astrologie,</hi> and <hi>Cosmographie;</hi> for the Auncients scarcely vnderstood thone halfe of heauen, of the earth, and of the sea; knowing nothing in the West beyond the <hi>Canaries;</hi> and in the East be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>Catygare.</hi> At this day all lands and seas are knowen, and sayled.</p>
               <p>Thales, Pythagoras, Aristotle, Hipparchus, Artemidorus, Eratosthenes, Strabo, Plinie, Macrobius, Capella, Virgill, and generally all the auncient Authours; saue Ptolomey, Auicen, and Albertus magnus, thought that of the fiue Zones of heauen, there were but two inhabited: and that the three others by excessiue heat, or extreme cold remained desert. At this day there is nothing more certain, then that they all are inhabited. Plinie, Lactantius, and S. Augustin, thought there were no <hi>Antipodes:</hi> But now we rule ouer them, and trafick with them ordinarily. They which in times past beheld the heauens, found but few mouings, and could scarce perceiue ten; But now (as
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:13829:130"/>
if the knowledge, both of the one, and the other world, had bin by some destinie reserued for our age) they haue bin obserued in greater number, and more admirable: and two other principall ones added vnto them, to serue for a certaine demonstration of many things appearing in the starres; and to discouer the hidden misteries of nature. <hi>Cosmographie,</hi> and <hi>Astrologie,</hi> are so beautified, that if Ptolomey the father of them both were aliue againe, he would scarce know them, being increased in such sort by the late obseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and nauigations.

Crinitus speaking of him, and of MARVLLVS his disciple, affirmeth, that both the one and thother is absolute in his kind; and that they two may be compared with the Auncients: deseruing verie well to be taken for good example, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as notable relicks of antiquitie. <hi>Fracastorius</hi> giueth such testimonie of PONTANVS.

               <p>But it is now time to make an end of this discourse; by which is euidently showen the vicissitude in all humane affaires, armes, learning, languages, arts, estates, lawes, and maners: and how they cease not to arise and fall; amending or empairing by turnes. And if the memorie and knowledge of that which is past, be the instruction of the present, and aduertisement for that which is to come: it is to be feared, least the power, wisedome, sciences, bookes, industrie, workmanshipps, and knowledges of the world, being come to so great excellencie; doe fall againe, as they haue done in times past,
<pb facs="tcp:13829:131"/>
and come to decay: by confusion succeeding after this order and perfection; rudenesse after ciuisitie; ignorance after knowledge; and barbarousnes after elegancie. I foresee alreadie in my mind, many strange Nations, differing in fashions, colours, and habites; rushing into Europe as did in old time the Gothes, Hunnes, Lombardes, Vandales, and Saracens; which will distroy our Townes, Cities, Castles, Palaces, and Temples: will change the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, lawes, languages, and religion; burne the Libraries, spoiling whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer good things they shall find in these Countries inuaded by them: to the end to abolish the honour and vertue thereof. I foresee warres arising in all Countries, both ciuile and foreine; factions, and diuisions springing, which will profane both diuine and humane whatsoeuer; famines, and pestilences threatning mortall men; the order of nature, the rules of the celestiall moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the agreement of the elements breaking off; deluges, and inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons comming on the one side; and excessiue heates, and violent earthquakes on the other: and the world drawing towards an end; bringing with it a confusion of all thinges, and reducing them againe to their auncient and former <hi>Chaos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But howbeit, theis things proceed (after the opinion of the <hi>Naturalists</hi>) from the fatall law of the world; and haue their natural causes: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, the euents of them do principally depend on the pronidence of God; who is aboue nature, and who alone doth know the prefixed time, wherein theis things shall come to passe. Wherefore, men of good mindes ought not to be amazed or astonished therewith; but rather to take courage vnto them, trauailing carefully, euery one in that vocation whereunto he is called; to thend to preserue to their power so manie goodly things lately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented, or restored; whose losse would be almost irrepairable; and to deliuer them ouer to such as come after vs; as we haue receiued them of our aunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours: and namely GOOD LETTERS, as long as it shall please God that they endure. Whom we will pray to preserue from indignitie, such as make profession of them worthily; that they may perseuere in this honest studie: amending the Arts, and clearing of the trueth, to his praise, honour, and glorie. For this occasion, the better to encourage them, shalbe added an Inquisition on that common saying of men, wherby they haue alwaies main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and do maintaine; that <hi>nothing can be said, which hath not bin said here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore:</hi> that thereby they may vnderstand, that the trueth is not wholy disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered; nor all the learning taken vp by our forefathers.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE beginnings of the Artes haue bin small, and the greatest difficultie, was in the first inuenting of them; then by the industrie of the learned, they were by little and little augmented; Correcting such thinges as were euill obserued, and supplying such as were omitted: but yet, without making any thing entierly absolute; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto there might nothing be added. Nothing is begon and ended at one time; but by succession of time, things are increased, amended, and become better polished. Almost all the Artes haue bin inuented by Vse and Experience; and afterwardes gathered and made by obseruation and reason: and then consequently reduced into better forme, and more certain, by Diuisions, Definitions, Argumentations, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations; by generall precepts and rules drawen from nature, not from opinion, and tending to the same ende: not by staying and resting on that which men had formerly done, said, or written; nor by only imitating of them, after the maner of slouthfull, and cowardly persons: but by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of somewhat of their owne, by some that came after, according as the matters from time to time discouered, and cleared themselues; the honour commonly remayning to the last commers, as the most exquisite, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished. By whose example we ought to trauaile courageously, with hope to make our selues better then them; aspiring continually to perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which as yet is not seene any where: considering that there remayne more thinges to be sought out, then are alreadie inuented, and founde. And let vs not be so simple, as to attribute so much vnto the Auncients, that wee beleeue that they haue knowen all, and said all; without lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing anything to be said, by those that should come after them. They haue not bin so arrogant, as to looke that none should meddle, or deale with those matters which they had handeled: But on the contrarie, considering
<pb facs="tcp:13829:132"/>
the difficultie of knowledge, and the weaknes of mans vnderstanding, they haue exhorted others to trauaile therein; speaking rather to stir them vp, and prouoke them thereunto, then to keepe them back, or stay them from writing. Let vs not thinke that nature hath giuen them all her good gifts, that she might be barren in time to come: but that as she hath in times past brought foorth certaine notable personages, who haue manifested many of her secrets; so she can againe bring foorth, such as by the influence of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and a singular inclination, by liuelynes of vnderstanding, and perseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of labour, shall attaine thither; whither long experience, diligent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation, and subtilitie of reason, haue not pierced till this present. She is the same that she was in the former famous ages: The world is such as it was before: The heauen and the time keepe the same order which they did; The Sunne, and thother Planets, haue not changed their courses; and there is no starre remoued out of his place: The Elements haue the same power; men are made of the same matter, &amp; in the same sort disposed as they were in old time. And were not the maner of lyuing corrupted, which we vse, preferring idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse before diligence, pleasure before profit, and riches before vertue; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would let, but this age might bring foorth as eminent personages in Philosophie as were Plato, and Aristotle; in <hi>Physick</hi> as Hippocrates, and Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len; or in the <hi>Mathematicks</hi> as Euclide, Archimedes, and Ptolomey. Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the help which we receiue of their books, the examples wherwith antiquitie hath instructed vs, so many obseruations, and inuentions si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence their time, and so long experience of all things: In such sort, that (if we consider it well) there was neuer age more happie for the aduancement of learning, then this present; if weying the shortnes of mans life, we resolue to employ our whole endeuour &amp; industrie, on the studie of true knowlege. Wisdom hath not fulfilled her work; much remaineth, and will alwaies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine: and there will neuer be wanting occasion to add therunto. Trueth doth offer her selfe to all those that wil seek her, and are of capacitie to receiue her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> albeit Democritus complayneth, that she is hid in a place as deep as a well, wherhence (in his opinion) it is not possible to draw her foorth. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer giueth himself to it in good earnest, shall find alway somewhat to do therin. All the mysteries of God and secrets of nature, are not discouered at one time. The greatest things are difficult, and long in comming. How many are there, not yet reduced into art? How many haue bin first knowen and found out in this age? I say, new lands, new seas, new formes of men, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, lawes, and customes; new diseases, and new remedies; new waies of the Heauen, and of the Ocean, neuer before found out; and new starres seen? yea, and how many remaine to be knowen by our posteritie? That which is now hidden, with time will come to light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and our successours will won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that wee were ignorant of them. M. Varro witnesseth, that in the space of a thousand yeares, the Arts were inuented, and augmented; which yet vntill this time are not perfected, and accomplished: But if the perfection of them hath not hitherto bin found, it followeth not therof, that it cannot
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:13829:132"/>
be found. For those things which at this day are held to be the greatest, and most admirable, had a time of beginning: and that which is now verie good, was not so at the first; but is increased by little and little, amending from time to time. Certainly, the excellencie in all thinges is slow, diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, and rare: seing that there is scarcely found in many hundreds, and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of yeares, amongst an infinite number of Students, one man wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of admiration; beeing learned and eloquent indeed; that with a good naturall wit, liuelynes and sharpnes of vnderstanding, experience and vse of things, hath the constancie and pacience to perseuere, which are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to such an interprise. This notwithstanding, we ought not to faint, or to dispaire; for if there be but small hope to excell and go beyond the best; yet is it an honour to follow them: and if there be no meanes to reach them; yet is it commendable to be second, or third vnto them. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conuenient to applie our industrie to the searching out of the trueth, as they haue done; and to endeuour to augment the doctrine of the Auncients: without so much subiecting our selues to antiquitie, that we do nothing for our age; and haue no care of our posteritie. Moreouer, many things inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Auncients, are lost. The wisdome of the Egiptians, Persians, Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and Bactrians, hath not come vnto vs; many good Greek and Latine Authours are not found; And amongst those that remayne, there are few agreable to the present maners, and affaires. We do not build now adaies af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fashion of Vitruuius; neither tyl the ground, nor plant, according to Varro, or Columella; nor take foode or physick after the ordinance of Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates, and Galen: We iudge not according to the Ciuil Law of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines; neither plead we as did Demosthenes, and Cicero; or gouerne our common wealthes, by the Lawes of Solon, and Lycurgus; or following the politicke precepts of Plato, and Aristotle. We sing not as did the Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients; neither warre we according to Vegetius: the art militarie being changed; and all kind of armes, both offensiue, and defensiue. Ptolomey in his Cosmographie, doth aduertize men to beleeue the latest trauaylers, touching the longitude, and latitude of places. Aristotle saith, that the <hi>Quadrature</hi> of the <hi>Circle</hi> may be knowen; but that it is not yet found out. Plato affirmeth, that Geometrie was vnperfect in his time, and that <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reometrie,</hi> and the <hi>Cubike</hi> wanted. The <hi>Calculations</hi> of the Heauens are not all found true. Vesalius curiously obseruing <hi>Anatomie,</hi> hath found manie pointes therein omitted by Aristotle, and Galen. Plinie, boasteth that he hath added in the <hi>Historie of liuing Creatures,</hi> that which Aristotle was ignorant of. Leonicenus reproueth Plinie of lyes, and errours in manie places. Auenreis hath written agaynst Galene; Galene against Aristotle; and Aristotle against Plato. There is no Authour so accomplished or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, in whom one may not finde somewhat wanting, or worthie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe. And that which is worse; there are some men so giuen and so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate to antiquitie, that they are ignorant, or haue very smal knowledge,
<pb facs="tcp:13829:133"/>
of the Countrie, and time wherein they liue. They know in euery point how Athens, Lacedemon, Carthage, Persia, &amp; Egipt were gouerned, not knowing the affaires of their owne Countrie; wherin they are strangers: As there are found many among vs, discoursing of the assembly of the <hi>Ariopagites,</hi> &amp; of the <hi>Comices</hi> of the Romains; vnderstanding nothing of the counsaile of France, the handling of the reuenewes, and the order of the Parliaments. Is it not then an abusing of studie, and of learning, to dwell continually among the Auncients,; and not to endeuour to bring foorth new inuentions, agreeable to the maners, and affaires of this time. When wil we leaue taking of grasse for corne; the flower for the fruit; and the rind for the wood; doing nothing but translate, correct, expound, or abridge, the bookes of the Auncients? who if they had bin also of this mind, not setting themselues to write; or to say any thing, but that which had bin written, or said before; no Art should haue bin inuented: or at least, they had all remained in their beginnings, without recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing any increase. The perpetuall Imitatours, or alwaies Translatours; or Commentatours, hyding themselues vnder the shadow of others, are verie slaues; and haue no generous courage in them: if they dare not once to do, that which they haue so long time learned. They alwaies distrust themselues; and follow the first in those things, wherin the later haue not agreed with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; namely, in those which are not yet sought out: and will neuer be found, if we content our selues with that which is alreadie inuented; without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any thing therunto. By occasion whereof, I will aunswere them hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward which obiect, that there are too many bookes.</p>
            <p>Certainly, if all that hath bin written by the auncient Philosophers, Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographers, Oratours, Poets, Physitians, Diuines, and Lawiers, had come to our hands, all had bin full of bookes; and we should haue had no other moue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables in our house but bookes: we should be constrained to go, sit, and lie vpon bookes. And yet there remaine so many, and are made from day to day, that the age of man could not suffice to read, not onely the writings in many disciplines; but in one particuler: and seldome are the Inuentories found per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. The great number serueth rather for charge, then for instruction; and it is much better to read some few that be good; then to wander thorough many which are euill. <hi>Lucian</hi> blameth an ignorant person, which boasted that he had many bookes; and <hi>Martial</hi> mocketh an other, who thought thereby to be accounted learned. Seauen hundred Volumes were found in the Librarie of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which were all burned together by a mischance of fire. The learned caried their books thither from all parts, as to the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of learning; and they read them in the <hi>Museum</hi> which was there, at the plaies ordained for the honour of Apollo, and of the Muses: the vanquishers receiuing great gifts, in the sight and knowledge of all the world; In somuch that none were reckoned learned, which had not won some prize there. <hi>Liuie</hi> calleth that great Librarie, a worthy work of kingly care, and magnificence: But <hi>Seneca</hi> saith, that it was neither care, nor magnifice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; but a studious pompe or superfluity: &amp; yet not studious; because the K<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. Ptolomeyes had not erected
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:13829:133"/>
it to serue for study, but for a shew and spectacle. As we see many priuate men also which haue gathered many togither, wel printed, bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, &amp; gilded: to serue onely for ornaments, which they neuer looke in themselues, nor suffer others for feare of fouling them. Also king ATTALVS assembled at <hi>Pergamus</hi> in emulation of the Ptolomeyes, two hundred thousand volumes which were giuen by Antonius to Cleopatra, &amp; so vanished. There were in the Library of the GORDIANS xl. thousand: and a great number of exquisite ones in that of LVCVLLVS, and AVGVSTVS. There are some at this present very wel furnished; both amongst the Christians, and the Mahometists.</p>
            <p>But going by the professions, I haue read that DIDYMVS a <hi>Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> composed foure thousand books: APPIAN sixe thousand; who was so arrogant, as to say, that he made them immortall, to whom hee dedicated his workes. CICERO said, that if his age were doubled, yet would it not suffice to read all the <hi>Lyrick Poets. Seneca</hi> thinketh as much of those that haue written of <hi>Logick.</hi> There is no people, nation, citie, common-wealth, seigniorie, cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, kingdom, or empire; but hath his Cronicles and Histories. In <hi>Greece</hi> one only war of <hi>Marathon,</hi> found three hundred Historiographers, &amp; <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his liues alleageth more then two hundred of them. SALVST, and LIVIE are come to vs vnperfect, and faulty: as are also many others of lesse reckoning both Greekes and Romaines. It is not possible to recken the books that are made of <hi>Phisicke,</hi> which hath many times bin changed, and diuided into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers sects. ARISTOTLE the Philosopher composed iiij. hundred volumes: and VARRO the most learned amongst the Romains as many. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour IVSTINIAN by the excessiue multitude of books which were of the ciuil Law, was constrained to cause the <hi>Pandects</hi> to be made: on which contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his edict haue bin heaped innumerable co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentaries. S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list saith, that the world is not able to receiue all the books which should bee written of IESVS CHRIST: as appeared in the time following, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were infinite written in many languages, concerning the Christian religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and the exposition of the old and new Testament. ORIGEN alone hath written sixe thousand bookes. The Gothes, Vandales, Alanes, Hunnes, Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards, Sarazens, Turkes, and Tartarians brought an inestimable losse to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries, and corruption to the languages.</p>
            <p>Bookes are different also according to the disposition of the times, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the countries wherein they are made: euen as wines are diuers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the territorie, qualitie of the aire, and disposition of the yere; the nature of the vine, &amp; industry of the keeper. Euery age hath his peculiar kind of speech; Euery nation and age his phrase: the Greekes and Latins writing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one sort; the Hebrewes, Chaldees, and Arabians after an other. All are not of continuance: and as many are lightly and easily made; so they are est<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soones and incontinently lost. Some are left off for the obscurity, and to affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted subtilty and barbarousnes which is in them: Others despised, or neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as vnprofitable; or consumed by length of time; or destroied by warres, changes of tonges, and of religions; or by being euil written and copied out;
<pb facs="tcp:13829:134"/>
or corrupted, &amp; depraued: In others there is nothing but tedious repetitions; by changing the order, and the words. <hi>Plinie</hi> a man of great reading, saith that in conferring and comparing of authours, he hath found the old written out word for word by those that were next after them, concealing their names; and choosing rather to be taken in their theft, then to acknowledge the debt. Those which are respected here as holy; are burned elswhere, as abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The affected to some certaine sect, religion, or profession, are red onely by people of the same sect, religion, and profession. The poemes, orations, epistles, chronicles, histories, comedies, and tragedies, are not loked on; but by such as vnderstand the tongue wherin they are written: &amp; out of it they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly lose their grace. There are not any which please and satisfy al peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; or which are receiued in al places; except they be aduisedly made, with great iudgment, &amp; profound learning, by a singular grace of God, and a rare goodnes of nature: resisting against enuious old age, &amp; warranting themselues from the silence of obliuion. Such as seeme to be those of <hi>Plato, Aristotle, Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates, &amp; Ptolomey<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> who not content with the images of things, and shadows of opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, haue sought the truth directly; &amp; haue therfore escaped the iniury of time, of fire, of water, &amp; of wars; among so many nations, &amp; contrary sects, translated into diuers languages; yet keeping stil the same grace, as when they were newly made. For as time abolisheth the opinions that are not wel grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; so it also co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmeth the infallible iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of a wise &amp; vnderstanding na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, augme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting alwaies the reputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of those writers which haue best obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, &amp; vnderstood it. The iudgment of time discouereth in the end the secret faults of al things; who being the father of truth, and a iudge void of passion, hath alwaies accustomed to giue a iust sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, of the life or death of writings.</p>
            <p>But seeing that the arts &amp; sciences begin, &amp; grow; are changed and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by care, diligence, remembrance, &amp; meditation, and are lost by neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, slouth, forgetfulnes, and ignorance; it being a thing most requisite that trueth should remain amongst men: It behoueth of necessity that the first being abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, others should come in their places; and that the old bookes being lost, there should be made new. For as other things being subiect to mutatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, haue need of continuall generation to renew themselues, and to maintaine eche of them his kinde: So must learning also be prouided for, by seeking of new inuentions, in steede of those that are lost, by changing that which is not well; and by supplying that which is wanting: to the end that it be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed; but amended from day to day. For the worlde being made of two things, whereof the one are perpetuall, and others mutable and corruptible: It is certaine that those which are perpetuall, as the heauen, the sunne, the moone, and thother starres, remain, constantly alwaies in one selfe same estate: But they that are moueable doe begin, and end; are borne, and die; do increase, &amp; diminish vncessantly; endeuouring notwithstanding (as much as they may) to come neere and participate of eternity: not by remaining alwaies one and the same (as doethe superiour and diuine thinges) but by continuing their kindes by the meanes of generation; which is an immortall worke in this
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:13829:134"/>
mortalitie. So the plants, and all liuing creatures which cannot endure long, by the necessity of the matter whereof they are made, renew themselues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually; procreating by budds, and seeds, their like. In such sort that by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of nature the yong do alwaies succeed vnto the old, and the liuing to those that are deceased; their kinds by this meanes remayning immortall. But men being indewed with a diuine and immortal soule, do aspire more to such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity and immortality; endeuouring to remedy that infirmity which they know in themselues: Namely such as haue their bodies most fruitful, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting of children, by whom they hope to perpetuate their name, and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage; Others that haue their minde better instructed, by bringing forth such fruits as are proper thereunto; as vertues, sciences, learned and elegant wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges, and other such fruits more noble, more admirable, and more dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then those of the body; which they prefer before children; and for which they voluntarily expose themselues to all labours, and dangers; neither spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their parsons nor their goods. Therhence ariseth in good wits the insatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble desire of honor, stirring them vp day and night, not to content themselues with base, and casual things: but to seeke by vertuous deeds, to recompence the shortnes of this life, by the memory of all posterity. Therehence procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the wonderfull desire of making themselues knowne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of leauing a good opinion of them, and getting an immortal renowne. And by how much the better they are, the more they striue to come to this point of immortalitie; which they do so long for. For those most excellent personages, woulde not haue trauailed as they haue done in times passed; without the hope which they had to be praised, and renowmed, as now they are. Such were the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Poets, Oratours, Historiographers, Physicians, Philosophers, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines; who haue brought forth so many bookes, which bring them immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall glory; as they themselues being immortall, do teach vnto others pietie, iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, &amp; equitie; declare the secrets of nature, both in heauen, &amp; in earth; teach the disciplines; containe Histories ful of examples; giue remedies against ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies; and other innumerable helpes, and meanes: without which we should liue worse then beastes; hauing neither religion, learning, nor ciuility. Such were the LAWMAKERS, who begat LAWES, and maners of gouernment, giuing to people, honest and durable maners of liuing. Such were the LAW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>IERS who haue ordered the busines, contracts, and Cases of particular par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; expounded the Satutes, and ordinances; showing the reason of them; aduertising how they ought to be kept, renewed, or abrogated. Such were the valiant CAPTAINES who did heroycall deedes for the defence, and libertie of their countrey; founded Empires, and monarchies; and builded ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: forgetting all other pleasures, to the end to leaue an immortall memory for the time to come. Such were many notable parsonages; who for hauing showed excellent inuentions, and exercised al vertues, haue bin greatly admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: euen to the deifying of some of them. And if we mislike barennes in the body, with greater reason ought we to detest it in the minde; and aspire to the like immortality, and renowme: the desire whereof is naturally giuen to all

parsons, to serue for a spur to prick them forward vnto honest actions. The husbandman hateth the fruitles ground; and the husband a wife that is barren: And all doe commende him more that by husbandry augmenteth his good, then him wich maintaineth it only in that estate which is falne to him by suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession. So in like maner it suffiseth not to know by the book without bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth something of our selues, whereby to helpe the truth. <hi>Plato</hi> saith that the <hi>Greekes</hi> haue bettered that which they receiued from the <hi>Barbarians. Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> is of opinion, that the <hi>Italians</hi> haue of themselues better inuented then the <hi>Grecians,</hi> or made that better which they borowed of them. And why should not we endeuour to do the like; amending that which the <hi>Barbarians, Greekes, &amp; Romaines</hi> haue left vnto vs? There is no want of good wittes, so that they be wel instructed. Peraduenture there are more in one place then in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but there are found some euery where; as in this countrey of ours, where nature hath shewed her selfe as fauorable as any where els: creating vs not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to any others, in situation, fertilitie, &amp; commodity of countrey, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of wits, ciuility of maners, equity of Laws, gouernment, and continuance of Monarchie; dexterity both in liberall and mechanical sciences, variety of all things either growing within the countrey, or brought from other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; multitude of publicke schooles well priuiledged, and richly founded for the institution of youth, and intertainment of Professours, and Teachers.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, if all men do thinke that the future belongeth vnto them; they that are Learned must not be neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in obtaining of that by the durable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of Learning, which others do pretend and seeke by workes of small continuance. But they ought to trauaile to their power, if not in respect of men (who show themselues oftentimes ingrateful towards their benefactors, and enuious of the present vertue) yet at the least for the honour of God: Whose wil is, that we should carefully preserue the arts and sciences, as also all other things necessary for life; and deliuer them ouer from time to time to our posterity, by learned, and elegant writings in good matters: giuing light to the obscure, credit to the doubtful, order to the confused, elegancy to the vnpolished, grace to such as are left of, noueltie to the old, and authoritie to the new.</p>
