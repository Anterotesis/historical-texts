         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and put to death in the Weſterne Indies by all ſuch meanes as
barbarouſneſſe it ſelfe coulde imagine or forge vpon the anueld
of crueltie. They haue deſtroyed thriſe ſo much lande as chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome
<pb facs="tcp:5172:3"/>
doth comprehende: ſuch torments haue they inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
yea ſo great and exceſſiue haue their trecherie been, that the
poſteritie ſhall hardly thinke that euer ſo barbarous or cruell a
nation haue bin in the worlde, if as you woulde ſay we had not
with our eyes ſeene it, and with our hands felt it. I confeſſe that
I neuer loued that nation generally, by reaſon of their intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
pride, notwithſtanding I can not but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend &amp; loue ſundry
excellent perſons that are among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Howbeit, God is my wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
hatred procureth me not to write thoſe things, as alſo the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
of the booke is by nation a Spaniard, and beſides writeth
farre more bitterly then my ſelfe.</p>
            <p>But two reaſons haue moued me to publiſhe this preface,
which I do dedicate to all the prouinces of the Lowe countreys:
The one, to the end, awaking the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelus out of their ſleep, may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to thinke vpon Gods iudgements: and refraine from their
wickednes and vice. The other, that they may alſo conſider with
what enemie they are to deale, and ſo to beholde as it were in a
picture or table, what ſtay they are like to bee at, when through
their rechleſneſſe, quarrels, controuerſies, and partialities them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
haue opened the way to ſuch an enemie: and what they
may looke for. Moſt me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do ground their opinion vpon the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of their cauſe, concluding, that in as much as God is iuſt,
he will graunt victorie to the right, and will ouerthrowe the
wicked. This was Iobes friendes diſputation, where they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
that for that Iob was afflicted, vndoubtedly he was wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.
Which reaſon is drawen out of a certaine rule, which it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
that nature hath printed in our hartes, that is, that God
puniſheth the euill, and in mercie rewardeth the good deedes.
There vpon did the inhabitants of Malta report that Gods ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
would not permit S. Paul to liue, when after he had eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
ſo dangerous ſhipwracke, the Viper leaped vpon his hande.
Howebeit notwithſtanding this rule be certaine and true, yet
do manie therein diuerſely deceiue them ſelues, concluding
thereby that GOD ſendeth no affliction but to the wicked,
as if hee laide not his croſſe alſo vpon the good: As Iob, the
Prophetes, and Martyres: yea, his owne ſonne Ieſus Chriſt,
and that for the mortifiyng of the fleſhe, and more and more to
quicken man in good liuing: and for his ſonne, to the ende in
him to puniſh our ſinne which hee tooke vpon him. Others doe
<pb facs="tcp:5172:3"/>
beleeue that God wil neuer ſuffer ſinne to bee long vnpuniſhed,
notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hauing long waited patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly for our repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
his clemencie is at length conuerted into iuſtice. Some againe,
that it is vnpoſſible for the wicked to gette the vpper hande in
an euill cauſe, notwithſtanding wee dayly ſee it fall out contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
vndoubtedly the Turkes victories &amp; conqueſtes in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
haue no foundation, but conſiſt vpon meere tyrannie and
vſurpation. For although Chriſtians ſinnes, eſpecially the great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe
in Gods ſeruice, haue bin the cauſes of our puniſhment, yet
muſt we confeſſe that the chriſtians, what errors ſoeuer ſome of
them do in their doctrine maintain, are not neuertheles ſo farre
deuoid of the truth, as are the Turkes, and yet do we ſee howe
mightily in few yeres they haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quered &amp; encroched vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtendom.
Alſo before the comming of the Turkes, namely ſoone
after the time of <hi>Mahamet,</hi> there came ſuch a flock of Sarazins,
that they deuoured firſt <hi>Egypt,</hi> then all <hi>Affrick,</hi> &amp; rooting out
Chriſtianitie out of the ſaid countries ſeazed vpon al Spaine: yea
proceeding forward, they camped in <hi>Aquitain</hi> vpon the riuer of
<hi>Toyre:</hi> inſomuch that it was to be doubted y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they might ſoone
haue caught hold vpon France, &amp; ſo vpon the reſt of chriſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dom,
had not God raiſed vp that mightie Duke of <hi>Brubant, Charles
Martel,</hi> who defeating them, driue them beyond the Pirenean
mountaines. But if we liſt to conſider the examples contained
in the holy Bible, whoſe reaſons are more exactly expounded by
the prophets, we do find that in the time of K. <hi>Hezechias,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the head citie, namely Hieruſalem, was not forced, yet
the leſſer townes being taken by the enemie, the flatte countrey
ſpoyled, the K. and the princes of <hi>Iuda</hi> had no more left them
but the bare walles of Hieruſalem. Alſo, albeit God did maruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
ſtrike the armie of <hi>Senacherib,</hi> and that his own children
flew him in his gods temples: yet were not gods people free from
ſuffering much, and from ſeeing the enemie enioy the moſt part
of their law: their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons did beare that which nowe we know,
&amp; more then we would, that is what an enemy entring by force
of armes into a land is able to do. But Nabuchadnezers victories
were far others, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he tooke, burned, &amp; ſacked eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the head ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
together with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very temple of Hieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; took their K. P.
&amp; hie P. priſoners, &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lu pulled out y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eies, &amp; fettered ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
forcing the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons during the ſiege to eate their own dong &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:5172:4"/>
Who is hee therefore that dare accuſe God of wrong, ſith ſuch
tyrants be called the Axe in the Lordes hands, as the executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of his iuſtice? Further wee ſee, that thoſe that haue the moſt
right are by the wicked robbed, ſlaine, &amp; murdered, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe
Gods doing. For it is ſaid: Curſed be he that doth the
Lordes worke negligently, in which place the holy ſcriptures do
ſpeake of ſuch miniſters and inſtruments of God. In this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of <hi>Don Bartholomew de las Caſas,</hi> wee do finde a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
example. For I pray you what right had the Spaniards ouer
the Indians: ſauing that the Pope had giuen them the ſaid land,
and I leaue to your iudgemente what right hee had therein:
for it is doubtfull whether his power doe ſtretch to the diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of worldly kingdomes. But admit hee had that authority,
was there therefore any reaſon that hee ſhould for crying in the
night, <hi>There is a God, a Pope, &amp; a King of Caſtile who is Lord
of theſe Countries,</hi> murder 12. 15. or 20. millions of poore rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
creatures, created (as our ſelues) after the image of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
God: Heere doe I, as in the beginning I ſaid, ſee a bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
depth of Gods iudgements. For it is a ſmall matter to ſay
that the wicked doe moleſt better men then themſelues, for the
cauſes aforeſaide: but to ſee a whole nation, yea, infinite nations
periſh ſo miſerablie, and as it ſemeth, without any cauſe, is it that
maketh moſt men to wander, yea euen aſtoniſheth ſuch as do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
theſe effects by the rule of their owne reaſons. Howebeit
we haue two examples in the Bible, though not altogether like,
yet very neere. It is ſaide in the ouerthrowe of Sehon: <hi>In thoſe
dayes wee tooke all his townes, and deſtroyed men women and
childen in the ſame, neither left we any thing remaining.</hi> The
like ſentence is there alſo of <hi>Og</hi> king of <hi>Baſan,</hi> yea, Moſes ſone
after alloweth all that was done, commaundeth <hi>Ioſua</hi> to doe as
much to all the other kinges in his iourney as was done
to thoſe two. If wee ſeeke the cauſe of ſuch executions,
man will bee as it were at his wits ende and ſtande mute. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
if men ſhould conſider the example of king Saule whom
God reiected, becauſe he did not wholy diſcomfit <hi>Amelec,</hi> but
ſaued their king, and reſerued the fatteſt of their cattell for
the ſacrifices, their vnderſtanding woulde giue ſentence cleane
<pb facs="tcp:5172:4"/>
contrarie to gods. What will they ſay, was it not a come<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ndable,
yea, a noble minde, for a king to ſpare his brother, either for an
Iſraelite to ſpare the cattell to the ende to ſacrifice them to the
God of Iſrael: yet was Gods ſentence pronounced by <hi>Samuel</hi>
cleane repugnant thereto, God <hi>loueth obedience better then
ſacrifice.</hi> And not long before God had commaunded both,
namely, that the Cananites and Amalekites ſhoulde bee rooted
out: and therefore hee was to bee obeyed, and for their diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
the Cananites remained thornes in the eyes of Iſrael,
and the king of <hi>Amalec</hi> whome <hi>Samuel</hi> neuertheleſſe hewed
in peeces, was the ſubuerſion of Saule and his royall familie, But
here may expreſſe reaſons be alleadged for ſuch iudgements of
God, which ſeeming ſeuere to man are neuertheleſſe, in that
they proceeded from God, meere iuſtice. Moſes ſaith, when
the Lord thy God hath reiected them before thy face, think not
in thine hearte, ſaying: The Lorde for my righteouſneſſe hath
cauſed mee to enter poſſeſſion of this lande, ſeeing hee hath for
their wickedneſſe rooted out theſe nations before thy face.
For thou art not through thy righteouſnes and vprightneſſe of
heart come to inherite their land, but it is for the abhominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
of theſe people, whom the Lord thy god hath expelled before thy
face.</p>
            <p>True it is, that as in a cleeare ſunnie light we may more eaſily

            <p>Thoſe whiche haue goe them out of Spaine into that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
bearing them ſelues as Chriſtians, haue kept two generall
and principall wayes to eradicate and aboliſhe from off the face
of the earth thoſe miſerable nations: The one is their vniuſt,
cruell, bloodie and tyrannicall warre. That other maner is, that
they haue ſlayne all thoſe which coulde any kinde of wayes ſo
muche as gaſpe, breath, or thinke to ſet them ſelues at libertie, or
but to withdrawe them ſelues from the tormentes whiche they
endure, as are all the naturall Lordes, and the men of valour

thoſe very ſame with the moſt cruel, dreadful, and hainous thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

            <p>The cauſe why the Spaniſhe haue deſtroyed ſuche an inſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite

ſcope and marke to gette golde, and to enriche them ſelues in
a ſhort tyme, and to mount at one leape to very high eſtates, in no
wiſe agreeable to their perſons: or, for to ſay in a word, the cauſe
hereof hath been their auarice and ambition, whiche hath ſeaſed
them the exceedingeſt in the worlde in conſideration of thoſe
landes ſo happie and rich, and the people ſo humble, ſo patient,
and ſo eaſie to be ſubdued. Whom they haue neuer had any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,

               <p>IN the Ile Hiſpaniola, which was the firſt (as we haue ſaid)
where the Spaniardes arriued, beganne the great ſlaughters
and ſpoyles of people: the Spaniardes hauing begunne to
take their wiues and children of the Indies, for to ſerue their
turne and to vſe them ill, and hauing begunne to eate their vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualles,
gotten by their ſweate and erauell: not contenting them
ſelues with that which the Indians gaue them of their owne
good will, euery one after their habilitie, the which is algates
very ſmall, foraſmuch as they are accuſtomed to haue no more
ſtore, then they haue ordinarily neede of, and that ſuch as they get
with litle trauell: And that which might ſuffice for three houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdes,
reconing tenne perſons for eche houſholde for a moneths
ſpace, one ſpaniarde woulde eate and deſtroy in a day.</p>
               <p>Nowe after ſundry other forces, violences, and tormentes,
which they wrought againſt them: the Indians beganne to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,
that thoſe were not men diſcended from heauen. Some
of them therefore hid their victuals: others hid their wiues and
children: ſome others fledde into the mountaynes, to ſeparate
them ſelues a farre off from a nation of ſo harde natured and
ghaſtly conuerſation. The Spaniardes buffeted them with
their fiſtes and baſtouades: preſſing alſo to lay handes vpon the
Lordes of the Townes. And theſe caſes ended in ſo great an
hazarde and deſperatenes, that a Spaniſhe Captaine durſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture
to rauiſh forcibly the wife of the greateſt king and Lord
of this Ile. Since whiche time the Indians began to ſearche
meanes to caſt the Spaniardes out of their landes, and ſet them
<pb facs="tcp:5172:12"/>
ſelues in armes: but what kind of armes? very feeble and weake
to withſtand or reſiſt, and of leſſe defence (wherfore all their wars
are no more warres then the playings of children, when as they
play at Iogo di Canne or Reedes.) The Spaniardes with their
Horſes, their ſpeares and launces, beganne to commit murders,
and ſtraunge cruelties: they entred into Townes, Borowes,
and Villages, ſparing neyther children, nor old men, neither wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
with childe, neyther them that lay In, but that they ripped
their bellies, and cut them in pieces, as if they had been opening
of Lambes ſhut vp in their folde. They layed wagers with ſuch
as with one thruſt of a ſworde woulde paunche or bowell a man
in the middeſt, or with one blowe of a ſworde woulde moſt redi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and moſt deliuerly cut off his head, or that woulde beſt pearce
his entrals at one ſtroke. They tooke the little ſoules by the
heeles, ramping them from the mothers dugges, and cruſhed
their heades againſt the clifces. Others they caſt into the riuers
laughing and mocking, and when they tombled into the water,
they ſayde, nowe ſhift for thy ſelfe ſuch a ones corpes. They put
others, together with their mothers and all that they met, to the
edge of the ſword. They made certayne Gibbets long and low,
in ſuch ſort, that the feete of the hanged on, touched in a maner
the ground, euery one enough for thirteene, in the honour and
worſhip of our Sauiour and his twelue Apoſtles (as they vſed
to ſpeake) and ſetting to fire, burned them all quicke that were
faſtened. Vnto all others, whom they vſed to take and reſerue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue,
cutting off their two handes as neere as might bee, and ſo
letting them hang, they ſayd: Get you with theſe letters, to carry
tydinges to thoſe which are fled by the mountaines. They mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
commonly the Lordes and nobilitie on this faſhion: They

that there were two or three of theſe gredirons, garm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed

infinite. And foraſmuch, as all the people which coulde flee,
hid themſelues in the mountaynes, and mounted on the toppes
of them, fled from the men ſo without all manhood, emptie of
all pitie, behauing them as ſauage beaſtes, the ſlaughterers and

dogs, to teare them in peeces at the firſt viewe, and in the ſpace

at the fourth watch in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> morning, the poore innocents, ſleeping

marking them with a hot iron, ſo after the fire being out &amp; quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
they go ſeeke the golde in their houſes. This is then the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portement
in theſe affayres of this miſchieuous perſon, with all

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5172:19"/>
The Byſhoppe alſo, which was the chiefe in the Realme,
hee ſent his ſeruauntes to haue his ſhare in the bootie: They
ſpoyled more golde within the tyme, and in this realme, as farre
foorth as I am able to recken, then woulde amount to a million
of Ducates, yea, I beleeue, that I make my reckoning with the
leaſt. Yet will it bee founde, that of all this great thieuing, they
neuer ſent to the king ought ſaue three thouſande Caſtillans,
hauing there about killed and deſtroyed aboue eyght hundred
thouſande ſoules.</p>
               <p>The other tyraunt gouernours which ſucceeded after, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the yeere thirtie and three, ſlue, or at leaſt wiſe conſented, for
all thoſe which remayned to ſlay them in that tyrannicall ſlaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</p>
               <p>Amongſt an infinite ſorte of miſchiefes, which this gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noure
did, or conſented vnto the doing during the time of his
gouernment, this was one: To witte, that a Cacike or Lorde
giuing him, eyther of his good will, or whiche is rather to bee
thought for feare, the weight of niene thouſande Ducates: the
Spaniardes not content withall, tooke the ſaide Lorde, and tyed
him to a ſtake, ſetting him on the earth, his feete ſtretched vp, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the which they ſet fire to cauſe him to giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome more
golde, The Lorde ſent to his houſe, whence there were brought
yet moreouer three thouſand Caſtillans. They goe a freſhe to
giue him newe tormentes. And when the Lorde gaue them no
more, eyther becauſe he had it not, or becauſe hee woulde giue
them no more, they bent his feete agaynſt the fyre, vntill that the
very marrowe ſprang out and trylled downe the ſowles of his
feete: ſo as hee therewith died. They haue oftentimes exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
theſe kinde of tormentes towardes the Lordes, to make
them giue them golde, wherewith they haue alſo ſlayne them.</p>
               <p>An other tyme, a certayne companie of Spaniardes, vſing
their theftes and robberies, came to a mountayne, where were
aſſembled and hid a number of people, hauing ſhunned thoſe
men ſo pernicious and horrible: whom incontinent entring vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they tooke a three or foureſcore, as well women as mayds, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
killed as many as they could kill.</p>
               <p>The morrowe after, there aſſembled a great companie of
<pb facs="tcp:5172:19"/>
Indians, to purſue the Spaniardes, warring againſt them for
the great deſire they had to recouer their wiues and daughters.</p>
               <p>The Spaniards perceiuing the Indians to approche ſo neere
vpon them, would not ſo forgo their pray, but ſtabd their ſwords
thorowe the bellies of the wiues and wenches, leauing but one
alone aliue of all the foureſcore. The Indians felt their hearts
to burſt for ſorrowe and griefe which they ſuffered, yelling out
in cries and ſpeaking ſuche woordes: O wicked men, O yee
the cruell Spaniardes: doe yee kill <hi>Las Iras?</hi> They terme <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi>
in that countrey the women: as if they woulde ſay, To kyll
women, thoſe be actes of abhominable men, and cruell as
beaſtes.</p>
               <p>There was a tenne or fifteene leagues from Ioanama, a
great Lorde named Paris, which was very riche of golde: The
Spaniardes went thither, whome this Lorde receiued as if they
had been his own brethen, and made a preſent vnto the Captaine
of fiftie thouſand Caſtillans of his own voluntarie accord. It ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
vnto the Captaine and the other Spaniardes, that he which
gaue ſuch a great ſumme of his owne will, ſhoulde haue a great
treaſure, which ſhoulde be the ende and eaſing of their traueyles.
They make wiſe, and pretende in wordes to depart: but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
at the fourth watch of the morning, ſetting vpon the towne
which miſtruſted nothing, ſet it on fire, whereby was burnt and
ſlayne a great number of people, &amp; by this meanes they brought
away in the ſpoyle fiftie, or threeſcore thouſand Caſtillans moe.</p>
               <p>The Cacik or Lorde eſcaped without being ſlayne or taken,
and leuied incontinent as many of his as he coulde. And at the
ende of three or foure dayes, ouertaketh the Spaniardes whiche
had taken from him an hundreth and thirtie, or fourtie thouſande
Caſtillans, and ſet vppon them valiantly, killing fiftie Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes,
and recouering all the golde whiche they had taken from
him. The others ſaued them ſelues by running away, beyng
well charged with blowes and wounded.</p>
               <p>Not long after, diuers of the Spaniſhe returne againſt the
ſaide Cacik, and diſcomfite him with an infinite number of his
people. Thoſe which were not ſlayne, they put them to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diuarie
bondage: in ſuch ſort, as that there is not at this day, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

or ſo much as one man alone borne of woman within thirtie

               <p>THe yeere a thouſande, fiue hundred, twentie and two, or
twentie three, this tyraunt went farder into the lande: to
bring vnder his yoke the moſt fertile prouince of Nicaragua, &amp;
ſo in thither hee entred in an euill houre. There is no man which
is able worthely and ſufficiently to ſpeake of the fertiltie, health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeneſſe,
proſperitie, and frequencie, of thoſe nations that
there were.</p>
               <p>It was a thing wonderfull to beholde, howe well it was peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled,
hauing townes of three or foure leagues in length, full of
maruilous fruites, which fruites were alſo the cauſe of the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quencie
of the people. Theſe people, for as muche as the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
was flatte and leuell, hauing no hilles where any might
hide them, and for that it was ſo pleaſant and delectable, that the
natiue inhabitauntes coulde not abandon it but with great heart
griefe and difficultie, for which cauſe they the rather endured and
ſuffered grieuons perſecutions, ſupporting as muche as they
coulde, the tyrannies and ſeruitudes, inflicted by the Spaniſhe.
Alſo for that by their nature they were verye ſofte natured and
peaceable people, theſe (I ſay) this tyraunt with his mates
made to endure (that which hee had vſed alſo to doe to deſtroy
likewiſe other realmes) ſo many dammages, ſo many murders,
ſo many cruelties, ſo many ſlaueries and iniquities, that there is
no humane tongue is able to diſcipher them. He ſent fiftie horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and cauſed to ſlay all the people of this prouince, (which is
greater then the countye of Roſſillon) with the ſwoorde: in
ſuch ſort, as that he left aliue, nor man, nor woman, nor olde, nor
<pb facs="tcp:5172:20"/>
young for the leaſt cauſe in the world: as if they came not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
at his commaunde: or if they did not bring him ſo many
load of Mahis, which ſignifieth in that country bread corne: or if
they did not bring him ſo many Indians to ſerue him and others
of his company: for the countrey lay leuell, as was ſayde, and no
creature coulde eſcape his horſes and diueliſhe rage.</p>
               <p>He ſent Spaniardes to make out rodes, that is to ſay, to go
a thieuing into other prouinces: and gaue leaue to thoſe rouers,
to carrie with them as many Indians of this peaceable people
as they liſted, and that they ſhoulde ſerue them, whome they put
to the chayne, to the ende they ſhoulde not giue ouer the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
of three or foureſcore poundes weight, wherewith they lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them, whereof it came to paſſe oftentimes that of foure thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Indians, there returned not home to their houſen ſixe on
liue: but euen fell downe ſtarke dead in the high way: and when
any were ſo wearie that they coulde march no farther for the
lieaft of their burdens, or that ſome of them fell ſicke, or fainted
for hunger or thyrſt, becauſe it ſhould not neede to ſtande ſo long
as to vnlocke the chaine, and to make the ſpeedier diſpatch, hee
cut off the head from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhoulders, and ſo the head tumbled downe
one way, and the bodie another. Now conſider with your ſelues,
what the other pore ſoules might thinke the whiles, Certainely
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he vſed to ſpeede out ſuch voiages, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Indians knowing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
none in a maner euer returned home again, at parting one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
they would weep and ſigh, ſaying: ſuch waies are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame
where as we were wont to ſerue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chriſtians, &amp; howbeit we tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueiled
ſore there: yet that notwithſtanding we came home again
to our houſen, our wiues and our children: but nowe wee goe
without hope euer to returne againe to ſee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; to liue together
with them.</p>
               <p>At a time when he woulde make a newe ſharing forth of the
Indians, becauſe his pleaſure was ſuch, yea men ſay that it was
in deede to ridde the Indians, as thoſe to whome hee meant no
good at all, but to giue them away to whome he ſawe good: hee
was the cauſe that the Indians ſowed not their groundes one
whole yeeres continuance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5172:21"/>
So as nowe, when they wanted bread, the Spaniards tooke
away from the Indians their Mahis, which they had in ſtore for
prouiſion, to nouriſhe them and their children: whereby there
dyed of famine, more then twentie or thirtie thouſande ſoules.
And it came to paſſe, that a woman fallen madde with the famin,
ſlue her ſonne to eate him.</p>
               <p>Foraſmuch as euery towneſhippe, and all other places in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited
that the Spaniardes had in their ſubiection, was none
other then a very garden of pleaſure (as hath bin ſayd) they kept
them ſelues euery one forſooth in the place eſcheated to him in
partition (or as they vſe to ſpeake) giuen him in commaund, and
did their affayres, nouriſhing themſelues with the goods and
prouiſions of the poore Indians. In this wiſe did they take the
landes and inheritaunces perticuler wherewith they ſuſtayned
themſelues, ſo as the Spaniardes kept in their owne houſes, all
the Indians, Lords, old men, women, and children, cauſing them
to ſerue them day and night without reſt, euen to the infantes
as ſoone as they coulde but goe, to put them to the greateſt thing
they were able to doe: yea and to greater thinges then they were
able to doe. And thus haue they couſumed and aboliſhed, and
doe yet euery day vnto this preſent, conſume and aboliſh the few
remayning behind, not permitting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to retayn houſe nor ought
els that is their owne. Wherein they may vaunt to haue ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
them ſelues, in their owne iniquities and vnrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
by them wrought in Hiſpaniola.</p>
               <p>They haue diſcomfited and oppreſſed in this prouince a great
number of people, and haſtened their death in cawſing them to
beare boordes and tymber vnto the hauen thirtie leagues di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
to make ſhippes with: and ſent them to goe ſeeke honnie
and waxe amiddeſt the mountaines, where the Tigres deuoured
them: Yea they haue laden women with childe, and women new
deliuered or lying in, with burdens enough for beaſts.</p>
               <p>The greateſt plague whiche hath moſt diſpeopled this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince,
hath beene the licence which the gouernour gaue to the
Spaniardes, to demaunde or exact of the Cacikes and Lordes of
the countrey ſlaues. They did giue them euery foure or fiue
moneths, or as often times as euery one coulde obtayne licence
<pb facs="tcp:5172:21"/>
of the gouernour fiftie ſlaues: with threatninges, that if they
gaue them not, they woulde burne them aliue, or cauſe them to
bee eaten with dogges.</p>
               <p>Nowe ordinarily the Indians doe not keepe ſlaues,
and it is muche if one Cacike doe keepe two, three, or foure:
Wherefore to ſerue this turne, they went to theyr ſubiectes, and
tooke firſt all the Orphelius, and after wards they exacted of him
that had two children one, and of him that had three, two: and in
this maner was the Carike, fayne to furniſhe ſtill to the number
that the tyrane impoſed, with the great weeping and crying of
the people: for they are people that doe loue (as it ſeemeth) ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
their children. And for becauſe that this was done con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually,
they diſpeopled from the yeere 23. vnto the yeere 33.
all this realme. For there went for ſixe or ſeuen yeeres ſpace,
fiue or ſixe ſhippes at a time, carrying foorth great numbers of
thoſe Indians, for to ſell them for ſlaues at Ioanama and Peru:
where they all dyed not long after. For it is a thing prooued
and experimented a thouſande times, that when the Indians
are tranſported from their naturall countrey, they ſoone ende
their liues: beſides that theſe giue them not their ſuſtenance,
neyther yet dimmiſh they of their toyle, as neyther doe they buy
them, for ought elſe but to toyle. They haue by this maner
of doing drawen out of this prouince of the Indies, whome they
haue made ſlaues, being as free borne as I am, more then ſiue
hundreth thouſande ſoules. And by the diueliſhe warres which
the Spaniſhe haue made on them, and the hidious thraledome
that they haue laid vpon them, they haue brought to their deaths,
other fiftie or threeſcore thouſande perſons, and doe yet dayly
make hauocke of them at this preſent. Al theſe ſlaughters haue
been accompliſhed within the ſpace of fourteene yeeres. There
may be left at this day in all this prouinces of Nicaragua, the
number of a foure or fiue thouſande perſons, whiche they alſo

thouſande houſeholdes, which is called Cholula: that is, that,
comming before them the Lords of the countrey and places nere

ſolemnitie and reuerence, ſo conducting them in the middeſt of
them, towardes their lodgings in the citie, in the houſen and
place of the Lorde, or other principall Lordes of the Citie: the
Spaniardes aduiſed with themſelues to make a maſſarre, or a
chaſtiſe (as they ſpeake) to the ende, to raiſe and plant a dread
of their cruelties in euery corner of all that countrey.</p>
               <p>Nowe this hath been alwayes their cuſtomary maner of
doyng, in euery the regions which they haue entred into, to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
incontinent vpon their firſt arriuall, ſome notable cruell
butcherie, to the ende, that thoſe poore and innocent lambes
ſhould tremble for feare whiche they ſhould haue of them: in this
wiſe they ſent firſt to ſommon all the Lordes and Noble men of
the citie, and of all the places ſubiect vnto the ſame citie: who
ſo ſoone as they came to ſpeake with the captyne of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niardes,
were incontinent apprehended before that anye bodye
might perceiue the matter, to bee able therevppon to beare ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges

fiue or ſixe thouſande Indians, to carry the loadings and carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of the Spaniardes: which Indians came forth with, and
were beſtowed into the baſe courtes of the Houſen. It was a
pitifull caſe to ſee theſe poore folke, what time they made them
redy to beare the carriages of the Spaniarde. They come all
naked, onely their ſecrete partes couered, hauing euery one vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their ſhoulder a nette with a ſmall deale of victuall: they
howe them ſelues euery one, and hold their backes cowred down

at the gates to hemme them in, whiles the reſt put theſe poore
ſheepe to the edge of the ſworde and the ſpeares, in ſuch ſort, that

all hewed in peeces.</p>
               <p>All the Lordes whiche were aboue and vnderneath were all

But the Spaniards, whoſe handes nothing can eſcape ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

O yee euill men! O ye euill men! What diſpleaſure haue wee

They ſiue here with the ſharpe of the ſword, an infinite number
of people, with great circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtances &amp; particularties of cruelties.</p>
               <p>From Cholula they went to Mexico. The king Motenſuma
ſent to meete them a thouſande of preſentes, and Lordes, and
people, making ioy and mirth by the way.</p>
               <p>And at the entry of the cawſie of Mexico, whiche reacheth two

great number of honorable Lordes, bearing with them rich pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents,
gold, ſiluer, &amp; apparell: &amp; at the barres of the citie, the king
in perſon with all his great court, came to receiue them, beeing
carried in a lighter of golde, and them accompanied vnto
the palace which hee had cauſed to bee made ready for them.</p>
               <p>The ſelfe ſame very day, as ſome haue tolde me the which were
then and there preſent, they tooke by a certayne diſſimulation
the great king Moteuſuma, as he miſtruſted nothing, and ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
foureſcore men to keepe him. Afterwardes, they put giues
on his feete. But letting all this paſſe, in the which there were
notable poyntes to ſpeake of, I will onely rehearſe one which
was ſinguler wrought by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe tirantes. The Captaine general
of the Spaniſhe was gone to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſea porte to take another Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhe
Captayne, which came againſt in warre: and hauing lefte
another vnder captayne in his roome, with a fewe more then an
hundreth men to keepe the ſayde king Motenſuma: theſe ſame
aduiſed with them ſelues to doe another thing woorthy the note,
to the ende, to encreaſe and augment more and more in all thoſe
regions, the awe which they had of them: a practiſe and ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geme
which (as I ſayde before) they haue often vſed. All this
meane while the Indians, the common people, and the Lordes
of the whole Citie ſought none other thing, ſaue onely to ſhewe
pleaſure and paſtime to their Lorde which was deteyned priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
And amongeſt other ſportes which they made him: were
their friſkes and daunces whiche they made in the euening tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe
out all the high ſtreetes and markette places, which daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
they call <hi>Mitotes,</hi> as in the iles they call them <hi>Areytos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The do weare in theſe friſkes all their riche furniture, their
beſt gorgious attyre, and their iewels, deſpiſing them ſelues to
<pb facs="tcp:5172:24"/>
liking in all thinges, for theſe are the greateſt ſignes of ioy and
feſtiuitie that they doe vſe. Nowe at this time, the nobilitis alſo,
and princes of the blood royall, eche one after his degree kept
their reuels and feaſtes at the neereſt vnto the houſe where was
deceyned priſoner their ſoueraigne. Ioyning vnto the walles of
the ſaide palace, were there more then two thouſande youthes,
Lordes children, which were the flower of the nobilitie of all the
ſtate of <hi>Morenſuma.</hi> Againſt thoſe made out the captayne of the
Spaniardes with a troupe of ſouldiers, ſending the others vnto
other places of the citie where the friſks and daunces were kept,
and all making wiſe onely to go ſee them. The captayne had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
in charge, that at a certayne appointed houre, they ſhould all
caſt them vpon thoſe dauncers, and hee himſelfe for his own part,
caſting himſelfe into the thronge, the Indians miſtruſting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but onely intending their diſport, hee ſaith: <hi>Saynttiago,</hi> let
vs amongſt, them, &amp; vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſirs. And thus their arming ſwords
in their fiſtes, they began to rip theſe bodies naked and delicate,
and to ſhed that blood gentle and noble, in ſuch ſort, as that they
left not a man aliue. The others performed the like in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
a thing which ſet all thoſe realmes and nations in a fright &amp;
extreme deſperation, and whereof as long as the world ſhall laſt,
they will neuer lin (if themſelues do not decay) to lament, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde
in their Areytos &amp; ſolemne meetings, as in rime theſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities,
and the ſpoile of the ſpring of their ancient nobilitie, of
the which they are wont to vaunt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues &amp; glory very much.</p>
               <p>The Indians ſeeing ſo great an iniquitie, and a crueltie ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
heard of the like, made againſt ſo many innocentes without
any cauſe: ſpecially hauing put vp quietly the impriſonment &amp;
that no leſſe wrongfull of their ſoueraigne Lorde, who alſo had
commaunded them not to make warre vpon the Spaniardes: all
the citie put them ſelues in armes, whervpon the Spaniards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aſſaulted and many of them hurt, with much a do might they
eſcape, but ſet a dagger on the cheſt of the breſt of the priſoner
Motenſuma to kill him, if he laied not him ſelfe out at a gallery
or winddowe, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand the Indians that they ſhould not beſet
the houſe, &amp; they ſhould keepe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quiet. The Indians taking no
care as then of obeying, aduiſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to chuſe a L. &amp; captayn from
<pb facs="tcp:5172:25"/>
amongſt them ſelues to conduct their battals. And for as much
as the Captayn which was gone to the hauen, was returned vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious,
leading with him more Spaniardes then he had carried
foorth, and for that hee was nowe neere at hande, the combate
ceaſed about a three or foure dayes, vntill ſuch time as hee was
entred the towne.</p>
               <p>Then the Indians aſſembled an infinite number of people
out of all the countrey, and ſkirmiſhed in ſuch wiſe, and ſo long
a ſeaſon, that the Spaniſh thought they ſhould al die on the place,
wherefore they deliberated to abandon the citie for one night.
That which their diſſeighu being knowen to the Indians, they
ſlewe of them a great number vppon the bridges of the Marſhes
in a warre moſt rightfull, and moſt lawfull for the cauſes moſt
righteous which they had as hath been ſaide: the whiche euery
reaſonable and true dealing man will mayneteyne for good.
Soone after, the Spaniſhe hauing realied themſelues, the
combat with the Citie renewed, where the Spaniardes made an
horrible and ghaſtly butcherie of the Indians, and ſlue an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
of people, and brent aliue the great Lords.</p>
               <p>After theſe great and abhominable tyrannies committed
in the Citie of Mexico, and in other cities, and the countrey
renne, fifteene, and twentie leagues compaſſe of Mexico: this
tyrannie and peſtilence aduaunced it ſelfe forwarde, to waſte al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
infect, and lay deſolate the prouince of Panuco. It was a
thing to bee wondered at of the worlde, of people that there
were, and the ſpoyles and ſlaughters there done. Afterwarde
they waſted alſo after the ſelfe maner, all the prouince of Tutte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peke,
and the prouince of Ipelingo, and the prouince of Columa:
eche prouince conteyning more grounde then the realme of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
&amp; of Caſtile. It ſhoulde bee a thing very difficulte, yea, impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to ſpeake or recount the diſcomfitures, the ſlaughters, and
the cruelties, which they there committed: and woulde cauſe a
great remorſe vnto the hearers.</p>
               <p>Here is to be noted, that the title wherewith they entred,
and beganne to make hauocke of all theſe harmeleſſe and ſilly
Indians, and haue diſpeopled that countrey, which ſhoulde haue
cauſed a great reioycing to all thoſe which ſhoulde bee in trueth
<pb facs="tcp:5172:25"/>
Chriſtians, beyng ſo peopled as they were: was to ſay that they
ſhoulde come and put them ſelues in ſubiection, to ſerue the
king of Spain, otherwiſe that they woulde kill them, or make
them ſlaues. And thoſe which came not incontinent to ſatiſfie
their demaundes ſo vniuſt, and did not put them ſelues into the
handes of men ſo vniuſt, cruell, and beaſtly, they called them
rebelles, as thoſe which had lift vp them ſelues agaynſt the
kinges Maieſtie, and for ſuch they accuſed them to the king our
ſoueraigne Lorde: the blinde vnderſtandings of thoſe which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned
the Indians, beeing not able to comprehende nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
this much, which in their lawes is more cleerely taught
then any other principle of Lawe, that is, that none can bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
a rebell, if firſt hee be not a ſubiect. Nowe let Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and thoſe which haue any perceyuerance conſider with
them ſelues, if ſuche caſes can prepare and informe the mindes
of any nations whatſoeuer liuing in their countrey in aſſurance,
and not thinking to owe any thing to any perſon, hauing their
owne naturall liege Lordes whom they ſerue and obey, ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to come and tell them tydings:</p>
               <p>Put you vnder the obeyſance of a king a ſtranger, whom
ye neuer ſawe, nor neuer hearde of before: otherwiſe knowe yee
that wee will rent yee incontinent all to peeces, ſpecially when
it is knowen by experience that they doe it in deede as ſoone as
it is but ſayde. And that which is farre more frightfull, they
take thoſe, which doe yeelde them ſelues to obey, to put them
into a moſte grieuous bondage, in the whiche there are
toyles incredible, and tormentes greater and of longer continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
then thoſe ſame of them which are excuted by the ſwoorde,
for in the ende they periſhe, they, their wiues, their children, and
their whole generation.</p>
               <p>And put the caſe, that through the threates and frightes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaide,
thoſe peoples, or any others whoſoeuer doe come to
obey and acknowledge the dominion of a ſtraunger king: doe
not theſe blunderers ſee, being altogether benummed with am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
and deueliſh couetouſnes, that they winne not a mite of
right, foraſmuche as ſo it is, that it is cauſed vpon frightes and
terrours which might bee able to ſlake men the conſtanteſt and
<pb facs="tcp:5172:26"/>
the beſt aduiſed: and that by the lawes of nature, man, and
God, it hath no more force then a handfull of winde, to make any
thing auaylable to any purpoſe whatſoeuer, ſauing the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and obligation which abideth them in the bottom of hel. I
paſſe ouer the loſſes and dammages which they doe to the king,
when as they ſpoyle his realmes, and bring to nought (as much
as in them lyeth) all the right which they haue in the Indies.</p>
               <p>Theſe are nowe the ſeruices, whiche the Spaniardes haue
done, and as yet doe at this houre vnto the aforeſaide kinges, and
ſoueraigne Lords, vnder the colour of this gallant title, ſo right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and ſo ſmoothly garniſhed.</p>
               <p>This Captayne tyraunt, with this gorgeous and pretended
title, diſpatched two other Captaynes, as very tyrauntes and
farre more cruell, and leſſe pitifull then him ſelfe, into greate
realmes moſt flouriſhing, and moſt fertile, and full of people, to
witte, the realme of <hi>Guatimala,</hi> which lieth to the ſeawarde on

called Guaymura, which coaſteth on the ſea on the North ſide,
confronting and confining the one with the other, three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

and the other by ſea: both the one and the other carried with
them a maynie of trowpes to ſerue on horſe backe and a foote.</p>
               <p>I ſay the trueth, that of the miſchieues which theſe two
haue wrought, and principally hee whiche went to Guati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mala
(for that other dyed ſoone after of an euill death,) there
might be made a great booke, of ſo many villanies, of ſo manie

them to peeces. They came to one borrowe great &amp; migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
which helde it ſelfe more aſſured then any other, becauſe of
their innocencie: whome the Spaniſhe layde deſolate in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
all whole, in the ſpace of two houres, putting to the edge of
the ſword, children, with women, and aged perſons, and all thoſe
which could not eſcape by flying.</p>
               <p>The Indians ſeeing that by their humilitie, by their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentes
and patience, they could not pacifie nor mitigate the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moode,
and enraged heartes of their enemies, and that without
any reaſon, or ſhewe of reaſon, they were hackt in peeces: and
ſeeing likewiſe that they were ſure to die ere long: they deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to aſſemble and realye themſelues to die all in warre, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge
themſelues the beſt that they could vpon, enemies ſo cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
and diueliſhe: knowing alſo well enough them ſelues with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
weapons, ſtarke naked, weake, and on foote, and ſuche as
coulde by no meanes preuayle or carrie away the victory, but
that in the ende they ſhoulde be deſtroyed: they aduiſed between
them to digge certayne ditches in the middeſt of the wayes, to
make their horſes tomble into, and pearcing their bellies with
pikes ſharpned and brent at one ende, there beſtowed of purpoſe,
and couered ouer ſo orderly with greene turfe, that it ſeemed
<pb facs="tcp:5172:28"/>
there was no ſuch matter.</p>
               <p>There fell in horſes once or twiſe: for the Spaniardes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes
coulde beware of them. But nowe to auenge them,
they made a law, that as many Indians as might be taken aliue,
ſhoulde bee flong into the ſame pittes. Hereuppon they caſt in
women with child, and women newe deliuered of childbirth, and
olde folke as many as they coulde come by, vntyll that the dit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
were filled vp. It was a lamentable thing to beholde the
women with their children ſtabbed with theſe pickes. All be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
they ſlue with thruſt of ſpeares, and edge of ſwoorde. They
caſt of them alſo to fleſhe fraunching dogges, which tare them
and deuoured them. They brent a Lord at a great fire of quicke
flames: ſaying, they woulde herein doe him honour. And they
perſiſted in theſe butcheries ſo vnnaturall, about ſeuen yeeres,
from the yeere 24. vntill the yeere 31. Let any eſteeme, what
may bee the number of people: whome they might haue
ſlayne.</p>
               <p>Amongſt an infinite of horrible actes which this curſed
tyraunt did in this realme with his bandes of ſouldiers, (for his
vnder captaynes were no leſſe miſchieuous and inſenſate then
himſelfe, and withall likewiſe thoſe that were vnder them again
to ſerue their turne,) this one was notable: That where as in the
prouince of Cuzcatan, where is at this houre, or neere there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boutes
the citie of Saint Sauiour, a countrey very fertile with
all the ſea coaſte on the Southe, contayning fourtie or fiftie
leagues: and likewiſe in the Citie of Cuſcatan the mother Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the prouince, there had been made him a very great enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynement,
of more then twentie or thirtie thouſande Indians
attending him, all laden with poultrie and other victuals: this
Captayne arriuing, and hauing receiued the preſentes, hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
that euery one of the Spaniardes ſhoulde take of this
great number of people, ſuch as ſhoulde pleaſe him, to ſerue him
all the time that they ſhoulde make their abode there, and that
they ſhoulde conſtrayne them to beare for them, of their carriage
all that ſhould bee needefull.</p>
               <p>Euery man tooke vnto him other an hundred, or fiftie, or as
<pb facs="tcp:5172:28"/>
many as it ſeemed ſuffiſed him to bee well ſerued. Theſe poore
lambelike innocentes ſerued the Spaniards with all their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
that there wanted nothing, vnleſſe they ſhoulde doe vnto
them godly honour. Meane while this captayne demaunded of
the Lordes very much golde: for they were principally commen
for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The Indians anſwered that they were ready to giue them
all the golde they had: and layed together a great furniture of
batchets of copper and gylt, where with they ſeruè their owne
turnes, the ſame reſembling golde, as in deede it hath in it ſome
litle deale. The Captayne cauſeth to put to the touch: and as
he ſawe it was copper, hee ſayde to the Spaniardes, nowe the
diuell take ſuch a countrey: let vs bee gone hence, ſeeing here is
no golde heere: and euery man put the Indians whiche hee hath
retayned to ſerue him, to the hotte irons, and ſo to marke them
for ſlaues.</p>
               <p>That which they did, branding with the kinges marke all
that they might. I ſawe the ſonne him ſelfe of the principall
Lorde of this citie, to bee ſo branded. The Indians which eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
with all other of the Countrey ſeeing all the miſchiefes of
the Spaniſhe, beganne to aſſemble, and put them ſelues in
armes: wherevppon the Spaniardes woorke great diſcom fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and ſlaughters, returning to Guatimala where they buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
a citie, the which God of a iuſt iudgement hath renuerſed
with three ouer whelmings falling all three together: the one
was with water, the other with earth, and the thirde with ſtones,
of the bigneſſe of tenne or twentie oxen. By ſuche like meanes
all the Lordes and the men that were able to beare armes being
ſlayne: thoſe which remayned, were reduced into the diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
ſeruitude afore ſaide, being made tributaryſlaues or villayns
regardant, but giuing for their tribute ſonnes and daughters,
for they will haue none other kind of bondimen. And ſo the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards
ſending whole ſhips laden with them to Peru to ſell the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their other ſlaughters, haue deſtroyed &amp; laide deſert an whole
<pb facs="tcp:5172:29"/>
Realme of an hundred leagues ſquare or about, a countrey the
moſt bleſſeful, and peopled the moſt that might be in the worlde.</p>
               <p>For the tyraunt him ſelfe wrote hereof, that it was more peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
then Mexico: and herein hee ſayde the trueth. Hee hath
done to death, with his conſortes and confrayryes, more then
foure or fiue Millions of ſoules in fifteen or ſixteen yeeres ſpace,
from the yeere twentie foure, vnto the fourtieth yeere: and yet
at this houre they ſlay and deſtroy thoſe that remayne.</p>
               <p>This tyraunt had a cuſtome, when as hee went to make
warre vpon any Citie or Prouince: to carrie thither of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
alreadie vnder yoked, as many as hee coulde, to make
warre vpon the other Indians: and as hee gaue vnto a ten or
twentie thouſande men which he ledde along no ſuſtenaunce, he
allowed them to eate the Indians whiche they tooke: And ſo
by this meanes hee had in his campe an ordinarie ſhambles of
mans fleſhe, where, in his preſence they killed and roaſted chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
They killed men, onely to haue off from them their handes
and their feete, which partes they helde to be the dayntieſt mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels.
When the nations of other countreys vnderſtoode of all
thoſe vnnaturall doings, they could not tel what to do for fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe.</p>
               <p>He was the death of an infinite ſorte of the Indians in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of ſhippes, the which hee carried from the North ſea vnto
the South, which are an hundred and thirtie leagues. He tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
after this rate great ſtore of artillerie, which he loded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſhoulders of theſe poore folke going naked: whereby I
haue ſeene very many fall downe in the high way, by reaſon of
their great burdens.</p>
               <p>Hee vndid whole houſholdes, by taking from the men their
wiues and daughters: the which afterwardes hee diſperſed in
gyftes to his marriners and ſouldiers to pleaſe them withall,
who led them along with them in their nauies. He ſtuffed all
the ſhippes with Indians, where they dyed for thryſt and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.
Certaynely if I ſhoulde ſtande to tell the particularities of
theſe cruelties: I ſhoulde make a great booke thereof, whiche
ſhoulde aſtoniſhe the worlde. Hee made two nauies, eyther of
<pb facs="tcp:5172:29"/>
a great number of ſhippes, with the which hee conſumed as with
fire and lightning flaſhing from heauen all thoſe peoples: O
howe many poore children hath hee made fatherleſſe Orphans.
howe many men and women widowers and widowes, beree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo of their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>! How many adulteries, whoredoms
and rapes, hath he been the cauſe of! How many hath he of free
made villanyes: Howe many anguiſhes and calamities by him
haue nombers ſuffered: Howe many hath hee cauſed to ſhedde
teares, ſighes and groninges: Of how many deſolations hath
he been the occaſion in this life, and the meanes for others to ſall
into euerlaſting damnation in the life to come, not onely of the
Indians which are innumerable, but of the miſerable Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes,
with whoſe ayde he hath ſerued himſelfe in villanies ſo
exceſſiue, and ſinues ſo enormous, and abominations ſo execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:

               <p>And it hath come to paſſe in his tyme, that there hath been

there had not been prouided with all ſpeede a court of audience,

yeere thirtie three, which are ſeuen yeeres, deſolating and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peopling
thoſe Countries, and killing the people there without
pitie or mercie, vntill the time that the newes came of the riches
of <hi>Peru,</hi> and that thereupon the Spaniardes hyed them thither,
by occaſion whereof this Diueliſh tyrannie ceaſed for a ſeaſon.
A few dayes after, his men returned, to doe and commit other
haynous enormities, as robberies, &amp; wrongful impriſonments,
with offences great againſt God: neither doe they ceaſe as yet
at this day to doe them, but haue laide deſart and diſpeopled all
thoſe three hundred leagues, the which were as well repleniſhed
and peopled, as hath been ſaide.</p>
               <p>There is no man that can beleeue, or rehearſe the caſes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler
of the cruelties, which were of them committed. I wyll
onely rehearſe two or three, comming to my remembraunce at
this inſtant. As theſe curſed Spaniards, went with their mad
dogges a foraging by the tracke, and hunting out the Indian
men and women: An Indian woman beeing ſicke, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſhee coulde not eſcape their dogges, that they ſhoulde not
rent her as they did others: ſhee tooke a corde and hanged her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
at a beame, hauing faſtened at her foote a childe ſhee had
of a yeere olde, and ſhee had no ſooner done: beholde theſe
Curres, whiche come and diſpatche this infaute, howe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
that before it dyed, a Religious man a Fryar baptized
it.</p>
               <p>When the Spaniſhe parted out of this Realme, one amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
others ſaide, to a ſonne of a Lorde of ſome Citie of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince,
that hee ſhoulde goe with him: the boy aunſwered,
and ſayde, hee woulde not forſake his Countrie. The
Spaniarde replyed: Goe with mee, or els I will cutte off
thine eares. The young Indian perſiſted in his firſt ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that hee woulde not forſake his Countrie. The Spaniarde
drawing out his dagger, cut off firſt one, &amp; then his other eare.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5172:33"/>
The young man abyding by it ſtill that hee woulde not leaue
his countrey: hee mangled off alſo his noſe, with the vppermoſt
of his lippes: making no more ſcrupuloſitie of the matter, then
if hee had giuen him but a phillip.</p>
               <p>This damnable wretch magnified him ſelfe, and vaunted
him of his doynges villauouſly vnto a reuerende religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
ſaying: that hee tooke as much paynes as hee coulde, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gette
the Indian women in great numbers with childe, to the
ende, hee might receiue the more money for them in ſelling them
great with childe for ſlaues.</p>
               <p>In this realme, or in one of the prouinces of newe Spaine,
a certayne Spaniard went one day with his dogs on hunting of
veuiſon, or els conies, and not finding game, hee minded his
dogs that they ſhould be hungrie, and tooke a little ſweet Babie
which hee bereaued the mother of, and cutting off from him the
armes, and the legges, chopped them in ſmall gobbettes, giuing
to euery dog his liuery or part there of, by &amp; by after theſe morſels
thus diſpatched, hee caſt alſo the reſt of the body or the carkaſe to
all the kenell together.</p>
               <p>By this ye may ſee how great the dull heartednes of the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes
is in that countrey, and howe God hath deliuered them vp
into a reprobate ſenſe; and what accoumpt they make of thoſe
ſame nations which are created after the image of God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
with the blood of his Chriſt. We ſhal ſee here after more
notable matter.</p>
               <p>Leauing nowe the cruelties infinite, and neuer hearde of
the like, which in this realme were done by thoſe which call the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
ſelues Chriſtians, and ſuch as no iudgement of man can ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
imagine them: I will conclude with this ſame: That is,
that being nowe departed the realme all the diueliſh tyrantes,
blynded with the couerouſnes of the riches of Peru, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> reuerend
father, fryer Iames, with foure other religious of S. Frauncis,
was moued in ſpirite to goe into this realme to pacifie them, and
for to preach to them, and to win vnto Ieſus Chriſt thoſe which
might bee remayning of the butcheries and tyranuous murders,
which the Spaniſh had bin perpetrating ſeuen continuall yeres.</p>
               <p>And I beleeue that theſe ſame were thoſe religious perſons,
<pb facs="tcp:5172:33"/>
the which in the yeere 34. certaine Indians of the Prouince of
<hi>Mexico,</hi> ſending before them meſſengers in their behalf, reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
them that they woulde come into their countrie, to giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
knowledge of that one onely God, who is God, and very Lorde
of all the worlde: and for whoſe occaſion the Indians helde a
councel ſundrie times, parlementing and informing themſelues
in their folke motes: to wit, what kinde of men thoſe might be,
which were called by the ſpeciall name of fathers and brethren,
and what it was that they pretended, and wherein they differed
from the Spaniardes, of whom they had receiued ſo many out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages
and iniuries: according in the ende to admit them with
condition, that they ſhould enter themſelues alone, and not the
Spaniardes with them, that which the religious promiſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
For it was permitted them, yea, commaunded them ſo to doe, by
the Viceroy of new Spaine, and that there ſhoulde no kinde of
diſpleaſure bee done vnto them by the Spaniardes. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
men preached vnto them the Goſpell of Chriſte, as they
are accuſtomed to doe, and as had been the holy intention of the
kinges of Caſtile, that ſhoulde haue been done. Howbeit,
that the Spaniardes in all the ſeuen yeres ſpace paſt, had neuer
giuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any ſuch notice of the truth of the Goſpel, or ſo much
as that there was any other king ſauing himſelfe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſo tyranniſed
ouer them, and deſtroyed them. By theſe meanes of the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
after the ende of fortie dayes that they had preached vnto
them, the Lordes of the countrie brought vnto them, and put into
their handes their idols, to the end that they ſhoult burne them.
After alſo, they brought vnto them their young children, that
they ſhould catechiſe them, whom they loue as the apple of their
eye. They made for them alſo Churches, and Temples, and
houſes. Moreouer, ſome other prouinces ſent, and inuited
them, to the ende that they might come to them alſo, to preache,
and giue them the vnderſtanding of God, and of him whom they
ſaide to be the great king of Caſtile. And beeing perſwaded
and induced by the religious, they did a thing which neuer yet
before hath been done in the Indies. (For whatſoeuer the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants,
ſome of thoſe which haue ſpoyled thoſe Realmes, &amp; great
Countries, haue contriued to blemiſhe and defame the poore In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
<pb facs="tcp:5172:34"/>
withall, they are mockeries and leaſings:) twelue or fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
Lordes, which had very many ſubiecets and great domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
aſſembling euery one for his owne part his people, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
their aduiſe and conſent, of their owne voluntarie motion,
yeelded themſelues to the ſubiection, and to bee vnder the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of the kinges of Caſtile: admitting the Emperour as
king of Spain, for their liege Soueraigne. Wherof alſo they
made certaine inſtrumentes, by them conſigned, which I keepe
in my charge, together with the teſtimonies thereunto of the
ſaid religious.</p>
               <p>The Indians being thus onwarde in the way of the faith,
with the great ioy, and good hope of the Religious brethren,
that they ſhoulde bee able to winne vnto Ieſus Chriſte all the
people of the Realme that were the reſidue, beeing but a ſmal
number of the ſlaughters, and wicked warres paſſed: There en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
at a certaine coaſte, eighteene Spaniarde tyrantes on horſe
backe, and twelue on foote, driuing with them great loades of
Idols, which they had taken in the other Prouinces of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians.
The Captaine of thoſe thirtie Spaniards, called vnto
him a Lorde of the countrie there aboutes as they were entred,
and commaundeth him to take thoſe idols, and to diſperſe them
throughout al his countrie, ſelling euery idol for an Indian ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
or an Indian woman, to make ſlaues of them, with threatening
them, that if hee did not doe it, hee woulde bidde them
battaile. That ſaide Lorde beeing forced by feare, diſtributed
thoſe Idols throughout all the countrie, and commaunded all
his ſubiectes, that they ſhould take them to adore them, and
that they ſhoulde returne in exchaunge of that ware Indies and
Indiſſes to make ſlaues of. The Indians beeing affeard, thoſe
which had two children, gaue him one, and he that had three gaue
him two. This was the ende of this ſacrilegious trafficke:
and thus was this Lord or Cacick, faine to content theſe Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards:
I ſay not Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>One of theſe abhominable chafferers, named <hi>Iohn Garcia,</hi>
beeing ſicke, and neere his death, had vnder his bed two packs
of Idols, and commaunded his Indiſh maide that ſerued him,
<pb facs="tcp:5172:34"/>
to looke to it that ſhe made not away his idols, that there were
for Murlimeus, for they were good ſtuffe: and that making
bent of them, ſhe ſhould not take leſſe then a ſlaue for a peece
one of them with another: and in fine, with this his Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and laſt will thus deuiſed, the caytife dyed, buſied with
this deep goodly care, and who doubteth but that he is lodged in
the bottome of hell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Let it nowe bee conſidered, and well weyed, what kinde of
aduancement of religion it is, and what are the good examples
of Chriſtianitie of the behalfe of the Spaniſhe, that ſayle to
the Indies? What honour they doe vnto God, how they paine
themſelues to haue him knowen and adored of thoſe nations:
what carke and care the haue of the doing of it, that by their
meanes the rather the ſacred faith ſhoulde bee diſperſed, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed,
and enlarged in the free paſſage thereof, amongeſt
thoſe ſilly creatures? And let it with all bee diſcerned, if the
ſinne of theſe men be any whit leſſe then the ſame of <hi>Ieroboam,
<hi>Which made Iſrael to ſinne,</hi>
                  </hi> by making two golden Calues
for the people, to fall downe before, and worſhippe: or otherwiſe
if it bee not like to the treaſon of Iudas, and which hath cauſed
more offence.</p>
               <p>Theſe bee the ieſtes of the Spaniardes, whiche goe to the
Indies, whiche of a truth very many times, yea, an infinit ſort
of times, for couetyſe, and to ſcratche golde, haue ſolde and do
ſell: haue reneaged, and do reneage as yet hitherto, and at this
preſent day: Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
               <p>The Indians perceiuing that, that, which the religious
had promiſed them, was as good as nothing: namely, that
the Spaniardes ſhoulde not enter thoſe Prouinces: and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Spaniards whiche had laded thither idols from other
places, there to make vent of them, they hauing put al their idols
afore into the handes of the Fryars, to the ende they ſhoulde bee
burned, and to the ende the true God ſhoulde bee by them ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
all the Countrie was in a mutinie, and a rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the religious Fryars, and the Indians comming vnto
them, ſay:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5172:35"/>
Why haue you lyed vnto vs, in promiſing vs by deceites that
there ſhould not enter any Spaniardes into theſe Countries?
And why haue you burnt our gods, ſeeing the Spaniards doe
bring vs other gods from other nations? Were not our gods
as good, as the gods of other prouinces? The fryars pacified
them in the beſt maner that they could, not knowing what to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere
them: and went to ſeeke out thoſe thirtie Spaniards, to
whom they declared the euill which they had done, praying the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to get them thence. That which the Spaniards would not doe,
but ſaide to the Indians, that thoſe religious men had cauſed
them to come thither themſelues of their owne accorde, whiche
was rightly an extreeme maliciouſneſſe. In the end the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
deliberated to kill the religious men: By occaſion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
the Fryars fled away in a night, hauing aduertiſement of the
caſe by ſome of the Indians. But after that they were gone, the
Indians better infourmed of the innocencie of the religious me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and of the vngraciouſneſſe of the Spaniardes, the ſent meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
after them, neere hand fiftie leagues of, beſeeching them to
come againe, and crauing pardon of them. The religious, as
the ſeruants of God, and zealous for the winning of their ſoules,
beleeuing them, returned to them, and were receiued as it had
been Angels. And the Indians doyng them a thouſand ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
abode with them foure or fiue monethes. And for becauſe
the Spaniards would neuer departe that Countrie, and that
namely the Viceroy with all that he could doe, could not draw
them thence, newe Spaine beeing farre of, howbeit, hee had
cauſed them to bee proclaimed traitours: And for as muche as
they neuer ceaſed to commit their outrages, and griefes accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
amongſt the Indians, the religious perceiuing that ſooner
or later they ſhould ſmell of the ſmoke, and peraduenture the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
light vpon their heades: and ſpecially that they coulde not
preach vnto the Indians with quiet, and aſſurance of the India<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
&amp; of themſelues, by reaſon of the continuall aſſaultes and lewde
deportments of the Spaniſh, they deliberated to leaue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> realme:
which in this maner was deſtitute of the light and the doctrine:
and thoſe ſoules, abode vnder the darkneſſe of ignorance, and in
the miſerie they were in, the remedie, and the watering of the
<pb facs="tcp:5172:35"/>
knowledge of God being bereaued them, alreadie euen at their
beſt, and when as they began to receiue it with exceeding wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingnes:
altogether like as if one ſhould withdraw the watring

               <head>Of the Prouince of Saint
Martha.</head>
               <p>THe prouince of Saint <hi>Martha,</hi> was a countrie where the
Spaniardes gathered golde in all plentie: the land bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the regions adiacent very rich, and the people induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to drawe out the golde. Wherefore alſo from the yeere one
thouſand, fiue hundred, fortie two, infinite tyrants haue made
thither continually with their ſhips, ouerrunning, and raunging
along the countrie, killing and ſpoyling thoſe the inhabitants,
and ramping from them that gold that they had, with ſpeedie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
euer to their ſhips, which went and came oftentimes. And
ſo wrought they in thoſe prouinces great waſts, and ſlaughters,
and cruelties horrible, &amp; that moſt commonly on the Sea coaſt,
and certaine leagues within the countrie, vntill the yeere one
thouſand, fiue hundred, and three. At what time there wente
Spaniſh tyrants to inhabite there. And for as much as the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
was exceeding riche as hath been ſaid, there euer ſucceeded
Captaines one in anothers roome, euerie one more cruell then
other: in ſuch ſort that it ſeemed that euerie one inforced him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
for the maſterie in doing of euilles and cruelties more
haynous then had been done by his predeceſſour. Wherefore
herein is the rule verified that we haue giuen before. The
yeere one thouſande, fiue hundred, twentie and nine, there went
a great tyrant, very reſolute, with great troupes: but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any feare of God, or compaſſion of the nature of man, who
wrought ſuche waſtes, and ſlaughters ſo greate, that hee excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
all others that had gone before him, himſelfe robbing for
<pb facs="tcp:5172:36"/>
the ſpace of ſixe or ſeuen yeares that he lyued, great treaſures:
ſaue after beeing deceaſed without confeſſion, and fledde from
the place of his reſidence: there ſucceeded him other murdering
tyrantes, and theeues, which made an ende of the reſt of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
whome the embrewed handes with blood, and the caruing
ſwoordes of the tyruntes his forerunners, coulde not extyrp.</p>
               <p>They ſet themſelues ſo forwarde in the countrey, in inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and laying deſolate very manye prouinces, with killing,
and taking priſoners thoſe people, after the faſhion before prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed
in other Prouinces, cauſing the Lordes together with
their Subiectes to ſuffer grieuous torments, both to make them
diſcouer the golde, and the places where golde might bee had:
ſurmounting as is ſayde euery way in number of miſchieuous
doinges, and in the maner of dooing, all that had paſſed before:
that from the yeere one thouſande, fiue hundred, twentie and
niene, vnto this day, they haue reduced into a wilderneſſe in
thoſe ſame quarters more then foure hundred leagues of lande,
which was no leſſe peopled then the other countreys which wee
haue ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>Verily if I had to make a bedrolle of the vngraciouſneſſes,
of the ſlaughters, of the deſolations, of the iniquities, of the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies,
of the maſſacres, and other greate inſolencies whiche
the Spaniardes haue done, and committed in thoſe Prouinces
of Saint <hi>Martha</hi> agaynſt God, the king, and agaynſt thoſe
innocent nations: I ſhoulde write an hiſtorie very ample.
But that maye bee done if God ſpare mee lyfe, hereafter in his
good tyme: onely I will ſette downe a fewe woordes of that
which was written in a letter by a Byſhoppe of this Prouince
to the king our Soueraigne: and the letter beareth date the
twentieth of May, 1541. The whiche Byſhoppe amongſt
other woordes, ſpeaketh thus: I ſay, ſacred Maieſtie, that the
way to redreſſe this countrey, is that his Maieſtie deliuer her
out of the power of Stepfathers, and giue vnto her an huſbande
whiche may intreate her as is reaſon, and according as ſhee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth:
otherwiſe, I am ſure hereafter as the tyrauntes
whiche nowe haue the gouernment, doe torment and tormoyle
her, ſhee will ſoone take an ende, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5172:36"/>
And a little belowe hee ſayeth: Whereby, your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie
ſhall knowe clearely, howe thoſe whiche gouerne in thoſe
quarters doe deſerue to bee diſamounted, and depoſed from
their gouernment, to the ende, that the common weales maye
bee relieued. That if that be not done, in mine aduiſe, they
can neuer be cured of their diſeaſes. His maieſtie ſhal vnderſtand
moreouer, that in thoſe regions, there are not any Chriſtians but
diuels, that there are no ſeruantes of God and the king, but trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors

               <p>The Indians in that countrey haue accuſtomed to ſay, if

they happen to fall downe, and to fainte for feebleneſſe, and for

they publiſhed among the Indians by proclamations,
and other publike ſonmo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that they ſhould come and dwell and
liue with them in that Ile. The Indians receiued them as their
owne bowels and babes: and as well the Lordes as ſubiectes
ſerued them with exceeding readines, bringing them to eate fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
day to day, as much as might ſuffice to feede, as manie moe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
For this is the liberality of all theſe Indians of the new
world, to beſtow on the Spaniards of al that they haue in great
abundance. The Spaniſh build a great houſe of timber, in the
which the Indians ſhould dwell all together: for the Spaniſhe
would haue it ſo, that there ſhould be one only houſe for all, and
no more, to compaſſe that, which they had alreadie premeditate to
do, &amp; did it. When they laid the thetch vpon the binding ſlaues
or ſparres, and had alreadie couered to the height of two mens
length, to the end that thoſe that were within might not ſee thoſe
that were without, vnder colour to haſten forward the woorke,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it might be the ſooner diſpatched, they ſet a great number of
people within, the Spaniards deuiding themſelues, the one part
of them being beſtowed without, compaſſing the houſe round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
with their weapons, becauſe of thoſe that might get forth,
the other part of them preſſe into the houſe: Thus laying hands
on their ſwordes, they began to threaten the Indians naked as
they were, to kill them if they did ſtirre, and then bound them.
And thoſe which fled they hewed them in peeces: Howbeit ſom
of the Indies which fled, both of the hurt &amp; not hurt, with others
that had not come within the houſe, toke their bowes &amp; arrowes
and aſſembled themſelues in another houſe, about an hundred or
two hundred perſons: And as they kept the gate, the Spaniards
ſet fire on the houſe, &amp; burned them aliue. After with their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe,
which might bee of an hundred or foureſcore perſons of
them which they had bounde: they get them to the Ile of ſaint
Iohn, where they ſolde the one moitie, and thence to the Ile of
Hiſpaniola: where they ſolde the other moity. As I reprehended
the captaine for this notable treaſon, at the ſame time, and at the
ſame Ile of Saint Iohn, hee made an anſwere: Syr, quiet your
<pb facs="tcp:5172:38"/>
ſelfe for that matter. So haue they commanded me to doe, and
giuen me inſtruction which ſent mee: that if I coulde not take
them by warre, I ſhoulde take them vnder countenance and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of peace. And in truth the Captaine tolde mee that in all
his life, he neuer had founde father nor mother, but in this Iſle
of the Trinitie, in reſpect of the friendly courteſies the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
had ſhewed him. And this hee ſpake to his owne greater co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
and aggrauating for the ſurcharge of his owne offences.
They haue done other things ſemblable vnto theſe infinite, in
this firme lande: apprehending the poore people contrary to
the ſafe conduct promiſed. Let it now be weighed, what maner
of doings theſe are, and whether the Indians in this wiſe taken,
might iuſtly be made ſlaues.</p>
               <p>At another time, the religious Fryars of ſaint Dominicks
order, being determined to goe preache, and to conuert thoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
who had not the light of the doctrine for to ſaue their
ſouls, as is the caſe at this day of the Indians: they ſent a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
man licentiate in diuinitie, a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vertuous &amp; holy, with a laie
man of his order his companion, to the ende hee ſhoulde take a
viewe of the Countrie, to trauerſe acquaintance with that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and ſearch out a place commodious to builde monaſteries.
The religious being arriued: they receiued them as Angelles
commen from heauen: and hearde with great affection, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and willingneſſe ſuch wordes as the religious at that time
were able to giue them to vnderſtand, more by ſignes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
for they knew not the tongue. It came to paſſe that there
arriued there another ſhip, after that the ſhip in whiche the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
men came was departed thence, and the Spaniſh in this
veſſell, keeping their diueliſh cuſtome, by ſuttelty without the
knowledge of the religious, carried away the Lord of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
called Alfonſo: were it y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Friars had giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him this name, or

they know any thing, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they may be baptized. They induced
fraudile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly this Don Alfonſo to come aboord their ſhip with the
lady his wife, &amp; other perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, making ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to go about to feaſt
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. In the end there entred ſeuenteene perſons, together w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the
<pb facs="tcp:5172:39"/>
Lord and his Lady: the Lord truſting that the religious perſons
being entred into his Countrie, woulde keepe the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes
from doyng any wrong: for otherwiſe hee woulde neuer
haue put himſelfe in the handes of the Spaniſh. The Indians
therfore thus being in the ſhip, the traiterous Spaniards hoyſed
ſayles, and away they went to Hiſpaniola with them, there ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them for ſlaues. All the Countrie ſeeing that their Lorde &amp;
ſoueraigne Lady were carried away, they run to the religious
men, purpoſing to kill them. The poore men ſeeing ſo great a
villany, were of themſelues at apoint to dye for ſorrowe: and it
is well to be beleeued of them, that they woulde rather haue gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
their lyues in the quarrell, then to haue accorded that anye
ſuch iniury ſhould haue been committed: ſpecially conſidering
that was enough to hinder the courſe begun, ſo as thoſe poore
Heathens ſhould neuer, neither heare, nor hearing beleeue the
worde of God. Howbeit, they appeaſed the Indians in the beſt
maner they could, ſaying that they woulde write to them at Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaniola
by the firſt ſhip that went, &amp; would take ſuche care and
order in the matter, that their ſoueraigne ſhould be reſtored them
againe with thoſe that were in his companie. God ſent imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
vpon a ſhip thither, no doubt for the greater confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the damnation of thoſe which there gouerned, and they
wrote to the Spaniſhe religious men that were in the Iſle of
Hiſpaniola. They cry out, and call heauen and earth to witneſſe
againſt them, both firſt, &amp; ſundrie times after: But the Iudges of
the audience, would neuer giue them audience to do the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iuſtice,
for becauſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues had part in the bootie of the India<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which
the tyrants had ſo againſt all right &amp; reaſon take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, The two reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
men, which had promiſed the Indians of the countrie, that
their Lord Don Alfonſo, with others ſhold come home<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the
reſt within foure moneths, ſeeing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they came not neither in 4.
nor 8. made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues redy to the death, &amp; to giue their life, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
they had gaged before they came out of Spaine, if neede
ſhoulde bee, and in that ſort the Indians tooke vengeance on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in killing them iuſtly, notwithſtanding that they were innocent:
for becauſe that they thought that the religious men had beene
the occaſion of this treaſon, and for becauſe they ſawe that,
that whiche they had certified and promiſed them, tooke not
effect: to witte, that within foure monethes they ſhoulde haue
<pb facs="tcp:5172:39"/>
home their Lorde: and for that, at that time they knewe not, and
nowe as yet they knowe not in that countrey, that there is any
difference betweene the religious well diſpoſed: and the tyrants,
theeues, and robbers the Spaniardes. Thoſe religious men
therefore right happie, ſuffered vniuſtly, and for the wrong ſo
ſuffered, there is no doubt but they are very martyres, and doe
raigne at this day with God in the kingdome of heauen in bliſſe,
who woulde that by their obedience they ſhoulde be ſent thither,
and ſhould haue an entent, to preache and ſpredde the holy faith,
and ſaue all thoſe ſoules, and ſuffer thoſe afflictions, and death
it ſelfe when it ſhoulde be preſented vnto them for Ieſus Chriſte
his ſake crucified.</p>
               <p>An other time, by reaſon of the great tyrannies and execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
actes of the curſed ones, bearing the name of Chriſtians, the
Indians ſlewe other two religious men of Saint Dominickes
order, and one of Saint Frauncis. Whereof I ran be a good
witneſſe for that I eſcaped at the time miraculouſly from the
ſame death, of the which it ſhoulde be a harde matter to entreat,
and woulde bee to amaſe men, by reaſon of the grieuouſnes and
horibleneſſe of the caſe. Wherefore I will not lay it abroad (for
being too tedious) vntil his tyme, and at the day of iudgement it
ſhall bee more euident, when God ſhall take vengeance of the
theeueries ſo horrible and ſo abhominable as are doone by thoſe
which beare the name of Chriſtians againſt the Indians.</p>
               <p>An other tyme in thoſe Prouinces at the Cape of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dera
(as they call it) there was a towne, the Lorde whereof
was named Higueroto, a name eyther proper to the perſon,
or it may bee common to the Lordes of the place. This Lorde
was ſo bounteous, and his people ſo vertuous and ſeruiceable,
that as many Spaniardes as came thither by ſhippe, they founde
there good entertaynement, meate, lodging, all cheering, and
refreſhing. This ſaide Lorde had alſo deliuered many from
death of thoſe which were fledde thither out of other Prouinces,
where they had ryoted and tyranniſed, and come thither ſicke,
and halfe dead for hunger: whom they refreſhed, and afterward
ſent them away ſafe, to the Ile of Perles, where there were
Spaniardes, and might haue ſlayne them if hee had woulde,
<pb facs="tcp:5172:40"/>
without that euer any ſhoulde haue knowen it. And ſhortely
to ſay the Spaniſh did call the Subiectes of Higurroto, the
houſe and harbour of euery bodie. A caytife tyraunt aduiſed
him ſelfe to outrage that people alſo, when as they thought
them ſelues ſure enough: and getting him to a ſhippe, hee had
there inuited a greate number of people to come a boorde her
as they were accuſtomed to doe, and to truſt the Spaniardes.</p>
               <p>A great nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of people being entred into her, men women,
and children, hee hoyſed ſayles, and went to the Ile of Saint
Iohn, where hee ſoulde them all for ſlaues.</p>
               <p>I came at the ſame inſtant to the Ile of Saint Iohn, and
I ſawe the tyrant, and vnderſtood what he had done. Hee had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
all that towneſhip: whereby he did great harme to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his fellow tyrants, wonted to rob, and roue all along thoſe
coaſts, inſomuch as they had in abomination this act ſo hydeous,
being bereft thereby of their harbour, and houſe of retire, as ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
&amp; familiar vnto them as it had bin their own home &amp; houſe.</p>
               <p>I deport me to recount the miſchieues infinite, and caſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable,
which haue bin vſed in that countrey, and are vſed as
yet.</p>
               <p>They haue ſingled out at times from all this coaſte, the which
was very wel peopled, vnto the Iles of S. Iohn &amp; Hiſpaniola,
aboue two millions of ſoules, ſeaſed vpon by their purchaſes in
thieuing and robbing: which alſo euery one of them they haue
ſlaine not long after, by thruſting them into the minerals and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
tormoyls, beſides the great numbers there were there alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
before time, as we haue aboue ſaid. And it is a pitifull thing,
and able to make any heart to cleaue, were it neuer ſo harde, to
ſee all this coaſt of a countrey moſt fertile, to bee lefte all naked
and emptie of people.</p>
               <p>It is a tried caſe, that they neuer conuey away their ſhippings
of Indians ſo robbed &amp; purchaſed, as I haue ſaid, but that they
caſt the third part into the ſea, beſides thoſe which they ſlay, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
they will ſort the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues for their chafer. The cauſe is, that
when as they will by all meanes atteine to the ende which they
haue propoſed to them ſelues: they haue need of a great number
of people, for to draw a great deale of money, according to the
<pb facs="tcp:5172:40"/>
quantitie of the ſlaues: &amp; they prepare but a very ſmall deale of
ſuſtenance and water, to ſerue but a few perſons: to the ende that
thoſe tyrants whom they call purueyghours of the ſhips ſhould
not ſpend them much. And there is but euen ſcarſe enough, ſaue
to ſerue the Spaniardes turne which go a rouing and robbing:
and there is alwayes wanting for the poore Indians. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
alſo they die for hunger and thirſt: and then there is none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
remedie but to caſt them ouer the boord into the ſea. And ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
a man among them did tell me, that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Ile of Lucayos,
where had been wrought great ſlaughters in this maner, vnto
the Ile of Hiſpaniola, which are a threeſcore, or ſeuentie leages,
there trended a ſhip all alongſt, without that it had either com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
or mariners carde, being guided onely by the tracke of
dead Indians carkaſſes, flotting vppon the ſeas, of them whiche
had been caſt in.</p>
               <p>And after they be landed in the Ile, whither they bring them
to make ſale of them: it is to make an heart to yearne of whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
haue he neuer ſo litle compaſſion, to behold them naked and
famiſhed, fall downe and faint for hunger and thirſt, women, and
aged men, and children.</p>
               <p>Afterwardes they ſoone after they ſeparate them, as it were
Lambes, the fathers from the children, and the wiues from the
huſbandes, in making troupes of them of tenne or twentie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and ſo caſt lottes on them, to the ende, thoſe curſed pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueighours
ſhould take their ſhare, which are thoſe who do equipe
or rig, and furniſh two or three ſhips for the nauy of thoſe tirants,
pirates, and rouers, robbing by ſea &amp; land, ſeaſing vpon all they
come by, and pulling the poore men out of their owne houſen.
And looke when the lot falleth vpon the flock where there were
amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any old or ſick perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tyrant to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame eſcheated,
would ſay: That the diuell take the olde graybeard, why doeſt
thou giue him mee, to the ende I ſhoulde goe burie him? And
this ſicke raſcall, what haue I to doe that hee ſhoulde fall out
to my lotte: to the ende, I ſhoulde bee his Phiſition to cure him?
Hereby a man may ſee, in what eſtimation the Spaniardes haue
the Indians, and howe they accompliſhe the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God, touching the loue of their neighbour, of the which
<pb facs="tcp:5172:41"/>
dependeth the lawe and the Prophetes. The tyrannie whiche
the Spaniſhe exerciſe ouer the Indians, to fiſhe for Pearles,
is one of the cruelleſt and curſedest thynges that is in the
worlde.</p>
               <p>There is no hell in this life, nor other deſperate ſtate in this
worlde, that may be compared vnto it: although that the trade
of golde finding, be in his kinde, very grieuous, and very miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
They let them into the ſea, three, or foure, or fiue fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
forth downe right vnder water, from the morning vntyll
ſunneſette, where they are continually flitting without ſtint, to
plucke oyſters, in the which are engendred the pearles. They
ſurge vp aboue the waters, with a nette full of oyſters to take
breath: where ſtandeth readie a Spaniſhe tormentor, in a little
cocke boate, or a brigantine, and if the poore wretches ſtay neuer
ſo litle while, to reſt them ſelues: they all to bee buffet them with
their fiſtes, and draw them by the haire into the water to returne
to their fiſhing. Their ſuſtenaunce is fiſhe, and the ſame very
fiſh which contayneth the pearles, and the bread Cacabi, or ſome
Mahis, which are the kindes of bread of that countrey: the one
of very ſlender nouriſhment, the other is not eaſie to bee made
into breade, of the which alſo, they neuer giue them their belly
full.</p>
               <p>The beddes that they lodge them in a nights, is to ſet them
by the heeles, their bodies requoyling on the coulde grounde, in
a payre of ſtockes for feare of running away. Sometymes
they are drowned in the ſea, and at their fiſhing and trauayle of
piking of pearles, and neuer riſe vp agayne aboue the water:
becauſe the Bunches and Whirlepooles (they call them <hi>Tube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rones</hi>
and <hi>Maroxos</hi>) two kinde of monſters of the ſea moſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell,
which deuour a man all whole, and thoſe doe kill them and
eate them.</p>
               <p>Let it nowe here be conſidered, whither in this purchaſe
of Pearles, the commaundements of God, touching the loue of
God, and our neyghbours be kept, or not: when they throwe
thoſe people into daunger of bodyes and ſoules. For they ſlay
their neighbours by their couetouſneſſe, without that they
receiue, or fayth, or ſacramentes, or els they prolonge
<pb facs="tcp:5172:41"/>
them in a ſtate of life ſo horrible, that they bring them to their
ende, and conſume them in a few dayes. For it is impoſſible, that
men ſhould be able to liue any long ſeaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder the water with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
taking breath, the continuall cold percing them: &amp; ſo they die
commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly, parbraking of blood at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mouth: becauſe of the kitting
together of their cheſtes, or bulke of the breaſt ariſing thereof,
that they are ſo continually without breathing vnder the water,
and of the blooddy fluxe, cauſed by the cold. Theyr haires, which
by nature are cole blacke, alter and become after a branded ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſette,
like to the haires of the ſeawolues. The ſalt peeter breaketh
out of their ſhouldiers, in ſuch ſort, that they ſeeme to bee a kind
of monſters in the ſhape of men, or els ſome other kinde of men.

               <p>The Almain tyrant gouernour, commaunded to take ſuche

for his wife, and ſo much for euery polle of his children. And yet
to preſſe them the more, he commanded to giue them nothing to
eate, vntil ſuch time as they had perfourmed the quantity of gold
inflicted them for their raunſome. Many ſent to their houſen
for golde, and bought out themſelues as they were able, and
thoſe ſame were deliuered, and went abroad about their buſines
to get their liuing. The tyrant ſent certain Spaniſh thieues &amp;
robbers, to go take them againe the ſecond time, after they had
bin redeemed. They are carried to the percloſe, and there wrung
with hunger and thirſt, to the ende, that they ſhoulde yet once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayn
pay for their freedom. And there were many amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt them,
which were taken and ranſommed two or three ſundry times.
Others which had not to giue, for becauſe they had all they had,
he let them within the toyſe dye for hunger.</p>
               <p>And in this maner hath bin deſtroyed a prouince very riche

This Tyrant reſolued with himſelfe to pearce farther into
the countrie, with a great deſire to diſcouer on that ſide, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame
hill of Peru. By occaſion of which accurſed voyage both hee
and others carried foorth with them, Indians infinite, loden
with two or three quintalles weight, and beeing enchained. If
any were weake or wearie, fainting for hunger, or trauelling,
they cut incontinent his head off euen with the coller of the
chaine that yoked them: becauſe they ſhoulde not neede to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamper
the others that went with the ſame collers aboute their

and beſtowed vpon others. To tel of the Prouinces, whiche hee
hath layed deſart, and the townes and places which hee hath
brent, for all the houſes are thetched, and to number the nations
which hee hath ſlaine, and the cruelties, and murders particuler,
which hee hath committed by the may, it would be a thing ſcarce
credible: howbeit very true and wonderfull. In this ſame ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
courſe and ſteppes marched ſithence the other tyrants, who
came from the ſaid Veneſuela, and others of the Prouince of S.
Martha, with the ſelfe ſame holy intention to diſcouer the ſame
ſacred golden palace of Peru: and founde the whole countrie in

ſpoyled, hauing been before moſt notablie peopled and moſt fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till,
as hath been ſaid, that themſelues as very tyrantes and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage

the ſame councell: and yet haue they neuer burnt aliue, any of
thoſe execrable tyrants. And this is nothing of all that whiche
hath beene proued, of the great outrages and miſchieues which
theſe haue committed. For as much as the miniſters of iuſtice,
which vntill this time haue him in the Indies, by reaſon of their
great wilfull and damnable blyndneſſe, haue neuer troubled
themſelues to examine the offences, ſpoyles, and murders, which
<pb facs="tcp:5172:44"/>

ſo many thouſande Caſtilians in rent, and this little verdict o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
general and confuſed, muſt ſuffice for the diſclaime of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
villanies. And yet that litle which they take vpon them, they
doe not auerr, nor deuiur vpon, as they ought to do. For if they
had regarde of their dutie to God and the king, it woulde bee
founde, that thoſe Almaine tyrants haue robbed the king of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
three thouſand Caſtillans of gold. For thoſe prouinces of
Veneſuela with the others which they haue laid waſte, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peopled
more then four hundred leagues forthright, as hath bin
ſaide, is a region the moſt bliſfull, and the richeſt of golde, and
was the beſt peopled of any in the worlde: in ſuch ſort, that they
haue diſturned from the kinges cofers, and occaſioned the loſſe
in this Realm of aboue two millions of rent, within ſeuenteene
yeeres ſithence by paſt, that theſe enemies of God and the king

infinite, which hath been done in all this coaſt of this firme land

which had of long tune beene exerciſed in all kindes of cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and murders, which had beene wrought in the firme lande
ſithence the yeere one thouſande fiue hundred, and ten, hee tooke
encouragement to accrewe in cruelties, murders, &amp; robberies:
beeing a man without loyaltie and truth, laying waſte Cities
and Countries, bringing them to nought, and vtterly vndoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
them by ſlaying the inhabitaunts, and beeing the cauſe
of all the euils, whiche enſued in that Countrie: that I am
right well aſſured, that there is not a man that can recounte
them and repreſent them to the eyes of the Readers, as is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite,
vntill ſuch time that wee ſhall ſee them and knowe them
at the day of iudgement. As touching my ſelf, if I woulde
take vppon met, to recounte the deformitie, qualitie and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of ſome one, I were not able to decipher them,
acording to that which is conuenient.</p>
               <p>Hee ſlue and laide waſte at his firſte arriuall with a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe
certaine boroughes, from whome hee pillaged a greate
quantitie of Golde. In an Ilande neere to the ſame prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
named Pagna, well peopled and pleaſant, the Lord there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
with his people receiued them as it had been Angels from
heauen: and ſixe monethes after, when as the Spaniſhe had
eaten vppe all theyr prouiſion: They diſcouered alſo vnto them
the corne whiche they kept vnder grounde for them ſelues,
their wiues, and their children, againſt a drie time and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren:
making them offer of all, with teers plentiful,
to ſpende and eate at theyr pleaſure. The recompence in
the ende whiche they made them, was, to put to the edge of the
ſworde and launce, a great quantitie of thoſe people. And thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:5172:47"/>
whom they could take aliue, they made them ſlaues: with other
cruelties great and notable which they committed, diſpeopling
as it were all that Ile.</p>
               <p>From thence they make to the pronince of Tumbala, whiche
is in the firme lande, where they ſlay and deſtroy as many as
they coulde come by. And becauſe all the people were fled as
affrighted by their horrible acces, they ſayde that they made an
inſurrection, and rebelled againſt the king of Spayne. This
tyraunt had this policie, and kept this order of proceeding, that,
vnto all thoſe whom hee toake, or vnto others which preſented
him with golde or ſiluer, or other thinges which they had: hee
commaunded them to bring more, vntill ſuch time as hee percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
that either they had no more, or that they brought him no
more. And then hee woulde ſay, that hee accepted them for the
vaſſals and lieges of the kinge of Spaine, and made muche of
them: and woulde cauſe it to bee proclaymed at ſounde of two
trompettes, that from thence forth they woulde take them no
more, and that they woulde doe them no maner harme at all:
ſetting it downe for good and lawfull, all that whatſoeuer hee
had robbed from them.</p>
               <p>And that hee put them in feare with newes ſo abhominable
which hee ſpredde amongſt them, before hee receiued them into
the ſafegarde and protection of the king, as though that after
they were receiued vnder the protection of the king, they woulde
not oppreſſe them, robbe them, lay them waſte and deſolate any
more, yea and as though he had not deſtroyed them.</p>
               <p>A fewe dayes after, the king &amp; Emperour of thoſe realmes,
named Atabaliba, came accompanied with a number of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
people, bearing their ridiculous armour, not knowing ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
howe ſwordes did carue, nor ſpeares did pearce, nor horſes
did runne, nor who or what were the Spaniardes: who if the
diuelles had any money, woulde ſet them ſelues in enqueſt to
goe robbe them. Hee commeth to the place where they were,
ſaying: Where are theſe Spaniardes? Let them come, I will
not ſtirre a foote, till they ſatiſfie mee for my ſubiectes whome
they haue ſlayne, and my boroughs which they haue diſpeopled,
and for my wealth, which they haue bereeued mee.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5172:48"/>
The Spaniardes ſet againſt him, and ſlue and infinite
ſorte of his people: they tooke him alſo in perſon, who came ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in a litter born vpon mens ſhouldiers. They treat with him,
to the ende that hee ſhoulde raunſome himſelfe. The king offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
to perfourme foure millions of Caſtillans, and performeth
fifteene, they promiſe to releaſe him: notwithſtanding in the
ende, keeping nor faith nor trueth (as they neuer kept any in the
Indies vnto the Indians) they layed vnto his charge altogether
vntruly, that by his commaundement the people aſſembled.</p>
               <p>The king anſwered, that in all the countrey there mooued
not a leafe of a tree, without his good will: that if there aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
any people, they were to beleeue that it was by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement,
and as touching himſelfe that hee was priſoner,
and they might ſlay him.</p>
               <p>All this not withſtanding, they condemned him to bee brent
aliue: but at the requeſt of ſome certayne, the Captayne cauſed
him to bee ſtrangled: and beeing ſtrangled, hee was burned.</p>
               <p>This king vnderſtanding his ſentence, ſayde: Wherefore
will you burne mee? What treſpaſſe haue I done yee? Did
not you promiſe mee to ſet mee at libertie, if I gaue you the
golde? and haue I not performed more then I promiſed? See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges
you will needes haue it ſo? ſende mee to your king of
Spayne: ſpeaking other thinges, to the great confuſion and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation
of the great wrongfulneſſe that the Spaniardes vſed,
whom in the ende they burned. Here let be conſidered the right
and title of this warfare, the impriſonment of this prince, the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and the execution of his death, and the conſcience, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they poſſeſſe great treaſures, as in deed they haue robbed in
thoſe realmes from this king and other ſeuerall lordes infinite.</p>
               <p>As touching the innumerable cruelties, and notable, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes
and enormities withall committed in the rooting out of
thoſe peoples by them, who call them ſelues Chriſtians: I will
here rehearſe ſome certayne, the which a fryer of S. Frauncis
order ſawe at the beginning, and the ſame certified vnder his
name and ſigne: ſending them into all thoſe quarters, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
others into this realme of Caſtile, whereof I retayne a
copie in my keeping in the which it is thus written:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5172:48"/>
I Frier Marke, of the order of Saint Frauncis, commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
ouer the other friers of the ſame order in the prouinces of
Peru, and who was one of the firſt religious men, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> entred into
the ſaide prouinces with the Spaniardes: doe ſay, bearing true
teſtimonie of certayne things, the which I haue ſeene with mine
eyes in that countrey, namely, concerning the entreating and
conqueſtes made ouer the naturall inhabitaunts of the countrey:
firſt of all, I am an eyed witneſſe, and haue certayn knoweledge,
that thoſe Indians of Peru, are a people the moſt kinde hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that hath been ſeen among all the Indians, beeing curteous
in conuerſation, and friendly vnto the Spaniardes.</p>
               <p>And I ſawe them giue to the Spaniſhe in abundaunce, golde,
ſiluer, and precious ſtones, and all that was aſked them, and
that they had, doing them all kinde of ſeruice lawfull. And the
Indians neuer yee ded foorth to warre, but kept them in peace
ſo long time, as they gaue them not occaſion, by their euill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating
of them and their cruelties, but contrariwiſe receiued
them with all amitie and honour in their boroughes, in giuing
them to eate, and as many ſlaues mankinde and women kind, as
they demaunded for their ſeruice.</p>
               <p>Item I am witneſſe, that without that the Indians gaue
occaſion: the Spaniſh as ſoone as they were entred the lande,
after that the greate Cacike Atabaliba, had giuen to the
Spaniſh more then two millions of gold, and had put into their
power the whole countrie without reſiſtance, incontinent they
burned the ſaid Atabaliba which was Lord of the whole countrie.</p>
               <p>And after him they brent his captayne generall Cochilima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,
who had come to the gouernour in peace with other Lords.
In the like maner, alſo a fewe dayes after they burned a great
Lorde named Chamba, of the prouince of Quito, without any
fault at all, and without hauing giuen the leaſt occaſion that
might bee.</p>
               <p>In like maner they burned vniuſtly Schappera Lorde of
the Canaries. Alſo they brent the feete of Aluis a great Lorde
amongſt all thoſe which were in Quito, and cauſed him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
ſundrie other torments, to make him tell where was the
gold of Atabaliba: of the whiche treaſure as it appeared, hee
knewe nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5172:49"/>
Alſo they brent in Quito Coſopanga, who was gouernour
of all the prouinces of Quito, which vpon the requeſt to him firſt
made by Sebaſtian of Bernalcaſar Captayne vnder the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
was come to them in peace: and onely becauſe hee gaue
them not golde ſo much as hee demaunded of him their burned
him with very many other Caciks and principall Lorde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And for
ought that I can vnderſtand, the intente of the Spaniards was,
that there ſhoulde not bee lefte aliue one Lorde in the whole
countrey.</p>
               <p>Item I certifie, that the Spaniardes cauſed to aſſemble a
great number of the Indians, and ſocked them vp in three great
houſen, as many as coulde be pored in, and ſetting to fire, they
burned them all, without that they had done the leaſt thing that
might bee, or had giuen to the Spaniſhe the leaſt occaſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
whatſoeuer. And it came to paſſe, that a prieſt, who is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Ocanna, drewe a young boy out of the fire, in the which hee
burned, which perceiuing an other Spaniarde tooke from out
of his handes the boy, and flunge him into the middeſt of the
flames, where he was reſolued into aſhes together with others.
The which Spaniarde returning the ſame day to the campe, fell
downe dead ſuddenly, and mine aduice was hee ſhould not bee
buried.</p>
               <p>Item I affirme, to haue ſeene with myne owne eyes, that
the Spaniſhe haue cutte the handes, the noſes, and the eares of
the Indians, and of their women, without any other cauſe or
purpoſe, ſaue onely that ſo it came into their fantaſie, and that
in ſo many places and quarters, that it ſhoulde bee too tedious
to rehearſe. And I haue ſeene, that the Spaniſhe haue made
their Maſtiues runne vpon the Indians to rent them in pieces.
And moreouer, I haue ſeene by them brent ſo many houſes, and
whole borughes, or towneſhippes, that I am not able to tell the
number. Alſo it is true, that they violently plucked the little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
from the mothers dugges, and taking them by the armes,
did throwe them from them as farre as they coulde: Together
with other enormities and cruelties without any cauſe, whiche
gaue me aſtoniſhment to behold them, and woulde be to long to
rehearſe them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5172:49"/>
Item, I ſawe when as they ſent for the Cacikes and other
principall Indians, to come ſee them in peace, and aſſuraunce
to them made, promiſing them ſafe conduct: and incontinent
as they were arriued, they burned them. They burned
two whiles I was preſent, the one in Andon, and the other in
Tumbala: and I coulde neuer preuaile with them to haue them
deliuered from burning, preached I vnto them neuer ſo muche.
And in God and my conſcience, for ought that euer I coulde
perceiue, the Indians of Peru, neuer lift themſelues vp, nor
neuer rebelled for any other cauſe, but for the euill entreating of
the other ſide, as is manifeſt vnto euery one, and for iuſt cauſe:
the Spaniardes deſtroying them tyrannouſly againſt all reaſon
and iuſtice, with al their countrey, working vpon them ſo many
outrages, that they were determined to die, rather then to ſuffer
much an other time.</p>
               <p>Item I ſay, that by the reporte of the Indians themſelues,
there is yet more golde hidden then is come to light, the whiche
becauſe of the vniuſtices and cruelties of the Spaniardes, they
woulde not diſcouer, neyther euer will diſcouer, ſo long as
they ſhall bee ſo euyll entreated, but will thoſe rather to die
with their fellowes.</p>
               <p>Wherein GOD our Lorde hath been highly treſpaſſed
agayinſt, and the kinges Maieſtie euill ſerued, hauing beene
defrauded in that, that his highneſſe hath loſte ſuche a countrey,
as hath been able to yeelde ſuſtenaunce to all Caſtile: for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie
of which countrey, it will be a matter of great difficulty,
diſpence, and charges.</p>
               <p>All theſe hitherto are the formall woordes of the ſayde
religious perſon: the which are alſo ratified by the Byſhoppe
of Mexico, which witneſſeth that the reuerende father hath to
his knowledge affirmed all the aboue ſaide.</p>
               <p>It is heere to bee conſidered, that the good father ſayeth,
that he ſawe thoſe thynges. For that, that hee hath beene
fiftie, or an hundred leagues vp into the conntrey, for the ſpace
of niene or tenne yeeres, and that at the very beginning, when
there were not as yet but very fewe of the Spaniardes: but at
<pb facs="tcp:5172:50"/>
the ringing of the golde, there were quickly gathered and flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
thither foure or fiue thouſande, which ſhedde themſelues
foorth ouer many great realmes and prouinces, more then fiue
hundred or ſixe hundred leagues, the whiche countrey hath
beene throughly deſtroyed, they executing ſtill the ſelfe ſame
practiſes, and others more barbarous and cruell.</p>
               <p>Of a veritie from that day vnto this preſente, there
hath beene deſtroyed and brought to deſolation moe ſoules
then hee hath compted: and they haue with leſſe reuerence
of GOD or the King, and with leſſe plttie then before, abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
a great part of the linage of mankinde.</p>
               <p>They haue ſlayne vnto this day in theſe ſame realmes
(and yet dayly they doe ſlay them) moe then foure millions
of ſoules.</p>
               <p>Certayne dayes paſſed, they pricked in ſhooting with
dartes of reedes to death a mightie Queene, wife of Eling, who
is yet King of that Realme, whom the Spaniardes by laying
handes vpon him compelled to rebell, and in rebellion hee perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth.</p>
               <p>They tooke the Queene his wife, and ſo as hath beene
ſayde, ſlue her againſt all reaſon and iuſtice, beeing greate
with childe as ſhee was, as it was ſaid onely to vexe her huſband
withall.</p>
               <p>If it ſhoulde bee expedient to recounte the particularities
of the cruelties and ſlaughters that the Spaniſhe haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
and yet dayly doe committe in Peru: without all doubt
they ſhoulde bee ſo frightfull, and in ſo great number, that all
that wee haue hitherto ſaide of the other partes of the Indies,
woulde bee ſhadowed, and it woulde ſeeme a ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the reſpecte of the grieuouſneſſe and greate number
hereof.</p>

               <p>VVIthin the yeere 1539. there tooke their flight toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſundry tyrantes, flocking from Veneſuela, from
Saint Martha, and from Carthagene, to ſearch for the Perous:
and there were alſo others which came downe from Peru it

found from beyond S. Marthas and Carthagene, 300. leagues

full of infinite people, kinde hearted like the reſt, and verye

               <p>Vnto the whiche Prouinces they gaue the name of Newe

               <p>I will recounte ſome one or other of an infinite whereof
they are giultie, as doone by them within theſe three yeeres,

               <p>The witneſſes doe depoſe in the ſame enquirie, that the ſaide
whole realme was in peace, the Indians ſeruing the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,
giuing them to eate of their laboure, and labouring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually,

The ſayde king, who was named Bogata, for feare which they

hoping that hee ſhoulde eſcape out of the handes of him whiche
tormented him. And hee ſent Indians which ſhoulde bringe

great quantitie of golde and precious ſtones. But bec auſe the
king did not giue an whole houſe full of golde, the Spaniardes

               <p>For the great feare of the notorious cruelties, that one of the

vnto the mountaines, in flying ſo great crueltie, a great Lorde
named Daytama, with many of his people. For this they
holde for their laſt remedie and refuge, if it might haue preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
them ought: and this the Spaniardes call inſurrection and
rebellion. Which the Captaine head tyrant hauing knowledge
of he ſendeth ſupplie of ſouldiers vnto the ſaid cruel man: (for
whoſe cruelties ſake, the Indians that were peaceable, and had
endured great tyrannies and miſchiefes, were nowe gone into
the mountaines:) to the ende hee ſhould purſue them. Who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

               <p>

Another time manie Indians beeing come to ſerue the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niardes,

chopping off the hands and noſes of many perſons, aſwell men
as women, and deſtroying very much people.</p>
               <p>Another time the captaine ſent the ſelf ſame cruell man with
certaine Spaniardes into the Prouince of Bogata, to bee infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by the inhabitants what Lorde it was, that was ſucceſſour
vnto the chiefe Lorde, whom he had made to die y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cruell death
in thoſe torments ſpoken of before: Who running along the
countrie throughout ſundrie places, tooke as many Indians as
he could come by: And for that he could not learn of them, what
he was that ſucceeded that Lorde, he mangled off ſome handes,
he bid caſt others, men and women vnto hungrie maſtiues, who
rend them in peeces. And in this maner haue been deſtroyed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
many Indies, and Indeſſes. One time at the fourth watch
of the night, he went to ouerrunne Caciks or gouernours of the
lande, with many of the Indians, which were in peace, and helde
themfelues aſſured (for he had giuen them his faith, &amp; aſſurance
that they ſhoulde receiue no harme nor damage) vpon credit
<pb facs="tcp:5172:52"/>
wherof, they were come foorth of their holes in the mountains,
where they had been hid, to people the plaine, in the which ſtoode
their citie: thus being commen without ſuſpition, &amp; truſting the
aſſurance made, he tooke a great number, aſwell men as wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and commanded to holde out their handes ſtretched againſt the
ground, &amp; himſelfe with a woodknife cut of their hands, telling
them that he did on them this chaſtiſement, for that they woulde
not confeſſe, where their new Lorde was, which had ſucceeded
in the charge of gouernement of the Realme,</p>
               <p>Another time for that the Indians gaue him not a cofer
full of golde, that this cruel captaine required them: he ſent men
to warre vpon them: who cut off the handes and noſes of men
and women without number. They caſt others before their dogs
being hunger bitten, and vſed to the feate of feeding on fleſh, the
which diſpatched and deuoured them.</p>
               <p>Another time the Indians of that Realme perceiuing, that
the Spaniards had brent 3. or 4. of their principall Lordes, they
fled for feare vp into a mountaine, from whence they might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende
themſelues againſt their enemies ſo eſtraunged from all
humanitie. There were of them by the teſtimonie of the
witneſſes a foure or fiue thouſande Indians. This aboue ſaide
Captaine ſent a great and notable tyrant, which exceeded farre
moſt of thoſe to whom he had giuen the charge to ranſacke and
waſte, together with a certaine number of Spaniardes, to the
ende that they ſhould chaſtiſe the Indian rebels: as they would
ſeeme to make them for that they were fled from a peſtilence &amp;
ſlaughter ſo intollerable: and as though it apperteined vnto
them, to chaſtice and puniſh them as malefactors themſelues in
deede being worthie of all torment without that any body ſhould
haue of them pitie or compaſſion, being ſo deuoid thereof, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
by the handling of thoſe poore innocents of that faſhion.
Well, ſo it is that the Spaniſh by force preuailed to get vppe to
the mountaine: for the Indians were naked without weapons.
And the Spaniardes cryed peace vnto the Indians: aſſuring
them, that they would do them no harme: and that they of their
partes ſhoulde not war any longer. Streight way as the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
ſtinted from their owne defenſe, the vile cruel man <hi>ſent to</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5172:53"/>
Spaniardes to take the fortes of the mountaine, and when they
ſhoulde get them to encloſe within them the Indians. They ſet
then like vnto Tigers and Lions, vpon theſe lambes ſo meeke,
and put them to the edge of the ſworde, ſo long that they were
faine to breath and reſt themſelues. And after hauing reſted a
certaine ſeaſon, the captaine commaunded that they ſhoulde kill
and caſt downe from the mountaine, the which was very highe,
the reſidue that were aliue: that which was done. And theſe
witneſſes ſay, that they ſawe as it were a cloude of the Indians
caſt downe from the mountaine, to the number by eſtimation
of ſeuen hundreth men together, where they fell battered to
peeces.</p>
               <p>And to atchieue all his great crueltie, they ſearched al the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
that were hid amongſt the buſhes: and hee commaunded
to cut of their heads, at blockes ends: and ſo they ſiue them and
caſt them downe the mountaine: yet coulde not hee content him
ſelfe with thoſe ſaide thinges ſo cruell but that hee would make
himſelfe a litle better knowne, augmenting his horrible ſinnes,
when as hee commaunded that all the Indians men and wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
which ſome priuate perſons had taken aliue (for euery one in
thoſe maſſacres is accuſtomed to cull out ſome one or other
mankinde and womankind, to the ende to become his ſeruants)
ſhoulde be put into a ſtrawen houſe, ſauing and reſeruing thoſe,
which ſeemed neceſſarie to bee employed in their ſeruice, and
that there ſhoulde be put to fire: thus were there burned fourty
or fiftie. Hee cauſed the reſt to bee flong to the carrion kinde
dogges, which rende them in peeces, and deuoured them.</p>
               <p>Another time the ſelfe ſame tyrant went to a Citie called
Cotta, and tooke there a great number of Indians, and cauſed
to be diſmembred by his dogs, a fifteene or twentie Lords of the
principal, and cut the handes of a great multitude of men &amp; wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:
which ſaide handes hee hanged one by another on a pole,
to the ende the other Indians might ſee that, which he had done
vnto them. There were ſo hanged one by another threeſcore and
ten payre of hands. He ſlyſed off beſides from many women and
children their noſes.</p>
               <p>No creature liuing and reaſonable, is able to decipher the
<pb facs="tcp:5172:53"/>
miſchiefes and cruell dealings of this fellowe, enemie of God.
For they are without number, neuer otherwiſe hearde of, nor
ſeene: thoſe, I meane, which he hath done in the lande of Guati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mala,
and all about where he hath become, for there are a good
many yeres paſſed, in the which he hath bene profeſſed in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie,
to bereaue that land, &amp; thoſe people.</p>
               <p>The witneſſes ſay for a ſurcharge, that the cruell dealings &amp;
ſlaughters which haue beene committed, and are yet in the ſaide
Realme of new Grenado, by the captaines themſelues in perſon
and by their conſents giuen vnto all the other tyrants, waſters,
and weeders of the nature of man, which were in his company,
and the which hath laid all the countrie wilde &amp; waſte, are ſuche
and ſo exceſſiue, that if his maieſtie doe not take ſome order
therein in ſome time (albeit that the ſlaughter and diſcomfiture
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Indians is done only to bereaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their gold, the which
they haue none of, for they haue ſurrendred all that which they
had) they wil in a ſhort time make an end of them ſo in ſuch ſort,
that there will bee no more Indians to inhabite the lande, but
that it wyll remaine in a wilderneſſe without beeing manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>Nay, wee muſt note heere the cruell and peſſilent tyrrannie
of theſe curſed tyrants, howe raging and diueliſh it hath beene,
that in the ſpace of two or three yeeres, ſithence that this realme
hath bene firſt diſcouered (which as they ſay both thoſe that haue
been there, and thoſe which depoſe as witneſſes, was the moſte
peopled of inhabitantes, as poſſiblie might bee any Countrie in
the worlde,) they haue raſed and emptied it with ſlaughters, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
themſeues ſo farre remooued from pittie, and the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
feare of God and the Prince, that the opinion is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the preſent ſuccour of his Maieſty, to ſtay theſe vnnatural &amp;
diueliſh tyrannies, there wil not remaine as muche as one man
aliue, &amp; I verily beleue it. For I haue ſeen with mine own eyes
that in theſe parts, they haue deſtroyed and diſpeopled in a ſmall
time, great countries.</p>
               <p>There are other great Prouinces, which bounde vpon the
ſaide Realme, of newe Grenado, which they call Popay an and
<pb facs="tcp:5172:54"/>
Cali, and three or foure others, which containe more then 500.
leagues of ground, which they haue deſtroyed and deſolated in
the ſame maner, as they haue done others, robbing and ſlaying
with torments, and the enormities afore ſpoken of. For the land
is very fertile, and thoſe that come from thence now dayly, dot
report, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is a rufull thing to ſee ſo manie goodly townes bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and ſayd deſolate, as they might behold paſſing vp &amp; downe
that way: ſo as there, where there was wont to be in one towne
a thouſand or two thouſand houſeholdes, they haue not founde
fiftie, and the reſt vtterly ranſacked and diſpeopled. And in ſome
quarters they haue found two or three hundred leagues of lande
diſpeopled and burned, &amp; great cities deſtroyed. And finally, by
that, that ſi thence into the Realmes of Peru, of the Prouince
ſide of Quito, are entred farre into the Countrie ſore and fel ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants,
as far as to the ſaid Realme of Grenado, &amp; of Popayan,
&amp; of Cali by the coaſt of Carthagene, and Araba, &amp; other accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
tyrants of Carthagene haue gone to aſſault Quito, and more<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ouer,
afterwards of the riuer ſide of S. Iohn, which is on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſouth
ſide, all the whiche haue met to ioyne handes together in this
exployte: they haue rooted out and diſpeopled aboue ſixe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
leagues of land, with the loſſe of an infinitie of ſoules, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſtill the ſelfe ſame to the poore wretches that remain behind,
howſoeuer innocent they appeare to be.</p>
               <p>Thus then is the rule which I ſet down at the beginning, by
them verified: that is, that the tyrannie, rage, and vngraciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the Spaniſhe, hath alwayes proceeded encreaſing in
their crueltie, vnnaturalneſſe, and miſchiuouſnes amongſt thoſe
ſo ſweete lambes. That which is continued at this preſent day
in thoſe Prouinces, amongſt other their doings worthy the fire
and torment, is this which followeth.</p>
               <p>After the ends of the ſlaughters and maſſacres of the warres,
they bring the people into the horrible bondage aboue ſaide, and
giue them to the commaundment of Diuels, to one an hundred
Indians, to another three hundred. The ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunder Diuel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth,
that there come before him an hundred Indians, which
incontinent preſent themſelues like lambes. He cauſing a forty
or fiftie amongeſt them to haue their heads cut off: ſaith vnto the
other there preſent, I will ſerue you of the ſame ſauce, if you
<pb facs="tcp:5172:54"/>
doe not mee good ſeruice, or if ſo be, that you goe out of my ſight
without my leaue.</p>
               <p>That for the honour of God, all they that haue read this peece
of worke, or ſhall giue it a reading, conſider nowe, whether this
act, ſo hideous, fell and vnnatural, doe not exceede all crueltie
and iniquitie, that may bee imagined, and whether the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes
haue any wrong offered them when a man calleth them
Diuels, &amp; whether were better, to giue the India<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to keep to the
diuels in hel, or the Spaniards which are at the Indies.</p>
               <p>After this I will rehearſe another diueliſh part, the which I
cannot tell whether it be leſſe cruell &amp; deuoide of manhood, then
are thoſe of ſauage beaſtes: that is, that the Spaniſh which are
in the Indies, doe keepe certaine dogges moſt raging, taught
and trayned wholy to the purpoſe, to kill and rende in peeces
the India<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. That let all thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are true chriſtians, yea, and alſo
thoſe which are not ſo, behold, if euer there were the like thinge
in the whole worlde: that is, to feed thoſe dogs, they led about w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
them whereſoeuer they goe a great nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of Indians in chaines
as if they were hogs, and kill them, making a ſhambles of mans
fleſh. And the one of them will ſay to another, Lend mee a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of a villaine, to giue my dogs ſome meate, vntill I kyll one
nexte, altogether as if one ſhoulde borrowe a quarter of an hog
or mutton. There bee others which goe foorth a hunting in
the morning with their curres, the which being returned to eat,
if another aſke him: Howe haue yee ſped to day, they aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere,
very well: for I haue killed with my dogs to day, fifteene
or twentie viliacoes. All theſe Diabolicall doings, with others
like haue beene proued in the ſutes of law, that the tyrants haue
had one of them againſt another. Is there any caſe more ouglie
or vnnaturall?</p>
               <p>I will here now deport me of this diſcourſe, vntill ſuch time,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there come other newes of things, in vngraciouſnes more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
and remarkable (if it ſo be, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there can be any more gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous)
or vntill ſuch time as wee may returne thither to beholde

yeeres continually with mine owne eyes: Proteſting in a good
conſcience before God, that I doe beleeue, and I holde it for
<pb facs="tcp:5172:55"/>
certaine, that the damages and loſſes are ſo great, with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
and ouerthrowes of Cities, maſſacres and murders,
with the cruelties, horrible and ougly, with the rauins, iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and robberies, all the which things haue beene executed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt
thoſe people, and are yet dayly committed in thoſe
quarters: that in all the things, which I haue ſpoken and deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phered,
as I was able the neereſt to the truth: I haue not ſaide
one of a thouſande, of that which hath beene done, and is dayly
a doyng at this preſent, be it that you conſider the qualitie, or bee
it, that ye conſider the quantitie.</p>
               <p>And to the end that all Chriſtians haue the greater compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of thoſe poore innocents, and that they complaine with mee
the more their perdition and deſtruction, and that they deteſt the
greedineſſe, loftineſſe, and felneſſe of the Spaniſh: that all doe
holde it for a moſt vndoubted veritie, with all that hath beene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
ſaide, that ſithence the firſt diſcouery of the Indies vntyll
nowe, the Indians neuer did harme vnto the Spaniſhe in any
place whereſoeuer, vntill ſuche time, that they firſte receiued
wrongs and iniuries, being robbed and betrayed: but indeede
did repute them to be immortall, ſuppoſing them to bee deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from heauen, and they receiued them for ſuche, vntill ſuche
time as that they gaue it forth manifeſtly to be knowen by their
doings, what they were, and whereto they tended.</p>
               <p>I will adioyne heerevnto this, that from the beginning vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this houre, the Spaniardes haue had no more care to procure
that vnto thoſe people ſhoulde bee preached the faith of Ieſus
Chriſte, then as if they had been curre dogs, or other beaſtes: but
in lien thereof, which is much worſe, they haue forbidden by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
meanes the religious men to doe it, for becauſe that that
ſeemed vnto them an hinderance likely to bee, to the getting of
their golde, and theſe riches which their auarice foreglutted in.
And at this day there is no more knowledge of God throughout
the Indies, to wit, whether hee bee of tymber, of the ayre, or the
earth, then there was an hundred yeeres agoe, excepting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

I brother Bartholomewe <hi>delas</hi> Caſas or Caſaus, religious
of the order of S. Dominicke, which by the mercie of God am
come into this courte of Spayne, to ſewe that the hell might hee
withdrawen from the Indes, and that theſe innumerable ſoules,
redeemed by the blood of Ieſus Chriſt, ſhoulde not periſhe for

               <p>After hauing couched in writing the premiſſes, I vnderſtood
of certayne lawes and ordinaunces, whiche his Maieſtie hath
made about this time at Barcellone, <hi>Anno.</hi> 1542. in the moneth
of Nouember, and the yeere following at Madrill: by the which
ordinaunces, there is order ſet downe, as the caſe them ſeemeth
to require: to the end, to cut off the miſcheieues and ſinnes whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
are committed againſt God and our neighbours, tending to
the vtter ruine &amp; perdition of this new world. His Maieſtie hath
made theſe lawes, after hauing holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many aſſemblies of perſons
of authoritie, of learning and conſcience, and after hauing had
diſputations and conferences in Valladolyd: and finally with the
aſſent and aduiſe of al thoſe others which haue giuen their aduiſe
in writing, and haue been founde neereſt approching vnto the
law of Ieſus Chriſt, and withall free from the corruption and
foyle of the treaſures robbed from the Indians: the which trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
haue ſoyled the handes and much more the ſoules of many,
ouer whom thoſe treaſures and auarice haue got the maiſterie,
and where hence hath proceeded the blinding, which hath cauſed
ſo to marre all without remorſe. Theſe lawes being publiſhed,
the creatures of thoſe tyrantes, who then were at the court, drew
out ſundrie copyes thereof (for it grieued them at the hearts: for
that it ſeemed them that thereby there was a doore ſhut vp vnto
them agaynſt their rauine and extortion afore rehearſed) and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed
them into diuers quarters of the Indies. Thoſe which had
the charge to robbe, roote out, and conſume by their tyrannies,
(euen as they had neuer kept any good order but rather diſorder,
ſuch as Luſifer himſelfe might haue helde) as they read thoſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
before the new iudges might come to execute their charge,
knowing it (as it is ſayd, and that very exediblie) by thoſe who
vntill this time haue ſupported and mayntayned their crimes
and outrages, to be likely that ſuch execution ſhoulde bee vſed of
thoſe laws: they ran into a mutinie in ſuch wiſe, as that when
the good Iudges were come to doe their duties, they aduiſed
with them ſelues (as thoſe which had loſt the feare and loue of
God) to caſt off alſo all ſhame, and obedience which they owe to
the king, and ſo tooke vnto them the name of open and arrant
<pb facs="tcp:5172:56"/>
traytours, behauing them ſelues as moſt cruell and graceleſſe
tyrantes: and principally in the realme of Peru, where preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this yeere 1442. are committed actes ſo horrible and fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
as neuer were the like, neither in the Indies, nor in all the

alſo betwixt themſelues by a iuſt iudgement of God, who hath
permitted that they ſhoulde bee the butchers one of an other of
them. By meanes of the ſupport of this rebellion, none of all the
other partes of this newe worlde would obey thoſe lawes: But
vnder colour of making ſupplication to his Maieſtie to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,

not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the countrey ſhoulde bee inhabited and
peopled (as had been conuenient ſhoulde haue
<pb facs="tcp:5172:57"/>
been done) but robbing from the Indians all their victuals they
had, the inbornes of the countrey were reduced to ſuche an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie,
that there were founde great numbers dead of famine
in the high wayes. And the Indians comming and going too
and fro the coaſt, laden with the carriage of the Spaniardes, hee
was the death by theſe meanes of about ten thouſande. For not
one that arriued at the very coaſt eſcaped death: by reaſon of
the exceſſiue heate of the countrey.</p>
            <p>After this following the ſame tract and way, by the whiche
Iohn of Ampudia was gone, hee ſent the Indians which hee
had purchaſed in Quito, a day before him, to the ende they ſhould
diſcouer the bourges of the Indians, and ſhoulde pillage them,
that when hee came with his maynie, hee might finde his boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
readie.</p>
            <p>And thoſe Indians were his owne mates: of the whiche
ſuch a one had two hundred, ſuch a one three hundred, and ſuche
a one a hundred: according to the haggage that euery one of
them had: which Indians came to yeelde them ſelues to their
maiſters with all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they had robbed. At dooing whereof they
committed great cruelties towarde young children and women:
and ſo had hee vſed before to doe in Quito, in burning the whole
countrey, and namely the garners where the Lordes kept their
Mahis in prouiſion.</p>
            <p>Hee ſuffered to bee done great outrages, in ſlaying the
ſheepe with the which they nouriſhed and entertayned for the
moſt part, both the Spaniſhe, and the naturall inhabitauntes of
the countrey. And onely to haue the braynes and the ſewet hee
permitted that there ſhoulde bee killed two or three hundred
wethers, of the whiche the fleſh was fayne to bee caſt away.
And the Indians friendes to the Spaniardes, and the whiche
went with the Spaniardes, onely to eate the ſheepes hearts, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a great number, for as much as they eate none other thing.</p>
            <p>And two men in one prouince, named Purua, killed 25. we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and ſheep fit for carriage like our horſe, &amp; the which were
worth amongſt the Spaniardes twentie, and fiue and twentie
duckates a peece, only to haue to eate the braines, and the ſewet.
So as by this diſorder of exceeding ſlaughter of beaſtes, haue
<pb facs="tcp:5172:58"/>
been loſt aboue an hundred thouſande head of cattell. By occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whereof alſo, the countrey came into a great neceſſitie: the
natiue of the lande miſerablie dying of famine. And Quito,
which was furniſhed of ſo great ſtore of Mahis, that it can not
bee well ſpoken, was by this meanes ſo aſſaulted with famaine,
that a ſtrike or buſhell of Mahis, was rayſed to the priſe of 10.
duckets, and a ſheepe to as muche.</p>
            <p>After that the ſayde Captaine was returned from the coaſt,
hee determined to depart from Quito, and to goe ſeeke the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
Iohn de Ampudia, leauing thereto moe then two hundred
of foote men and horſe men, amongſt whome were a great many
inhabitauntes of the citie of Quito. Vnto thoſe inhabitaunts the
captaine gaue licence to carrie with them the Cacikes, that were
eſcheated them in ſharing, with as many Indians as they would.
That which they did: and Alfonſo Sanches Nuita caried forth
with him his Cacike, with moe then an hundred Indians beſids:
and in like maner Peter Cibo and his couſin: and they led out
more then an hundred and fiftie with their wiues: and ſundrie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
ſped out their children, becauſe that in a maner euery one died
for hunger. Alſo Moran inhabitant of Popaian, caried out moe
then two hundred perſons. And the like did all the reſt, citizens
and ſouldiers, euery one after his abilitie: the ſouldiers crauing
that they might haue licence giuen them to captiue thoſe Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
men and women, which they carried forth: the which was
graunted vnto them vntyll the death of the ſayde captiues, and
thoſe deceaſed, to take as many more: for if the Indians were
ſubiectes of his Maieſtie, ſo likewiſe were the Spaniardes that
died in the warres as well as they.</p>
            <p>And after this maner departed the ſayde Captayne of Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
going to a citie called Otaba, the which he held at that houre
for his ſhare: and demanded of the Cacike, that there ſhoulde bee
giuen him fiue hundred men to lead to the warres: which were
giuen him with certayne principall perſons of the Indians. Hee
departed ſome of thoſe people amongſt his ſouldiers, and ledde
forth the reſt with him, ſome laden, and ſome chayned, and ſome
vnbounde to ſerue him, and to bring him meate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5172:58"/>
Thus carried hee his ſouldiers ſome pinniond in chaynes,
and ſome in coardes. When they departed out of the Prouince
of Quito, they carried out moe then ſixe thouſande Indians, men
and women, and of al thoſe there neuer returned home into their
countrey twentie perſons. For they dyed all thorough the great
and exceſſiue trauell, which they made them endure in thoſe br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
countreys contrary to their nature. It happened at that
tyme that one Alfonſo Sanches, whom the ſaide Captayne ſent
for chieftayne ouer a certayne number of men into a Prouince
there, met with a good company of women, and young boyes
laden with victuals: who ſtayed wayting for them without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
from the place to giue them of that which they had, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
ſo done, the captaine commaunded that they ſhould bee put
to the ſharpe of the ſworde. There happened here a mayuailous
thing: which was, that a ſouldier ſtriking an Indeſſe woman, his
ſworde brake a two in the middeſt, at the firſt blowe, and at the
ſeconde blowe there remayned nought in his handes, but the
pomell hauft without that the woman was hurt. And an other
ſouldier, willing to ſtrike another Indeſſe woman, with aſquare
dagger he had, the dagger brake at the firſt choppe, the length of
foure fingers, and at the ſeconde, there remayned vnto him no
more ſaue the hauft.</p>
            <p>At the ſame tyme the ſayde Captayne yeeded foorth of Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and drewe out a great number of the naturall inbornes, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marriyng
them, and giuing their young wiues vnto his Indians
whom hee ledde along, and the others wiues hee gaue to others
which remayned in the citie, for that they were too olde.</p>
            <p>There followed out of Quito a woman with a litle childe
in her armes, crying after him, and entreating him, that her
huſbande might not bee forced to goe with him, for that ſhee
had three little children, the whiche ſhee coulde not nouriſhe
but were ready to dye for hunger:</p>
            <p>And as the Captayne gaue her a churliſhe anſwere at her
firſt ſute, ſhee returned the ſeconde time with greater cries, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that her children dyed for hunger.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5172:59"/>
And ſeeing that the Captayne gaue her the repulſe, and that
hee woulde not reſtore her, her huſbande: ſhee beat the childes
head agaynſt the ſtones, and ſlue it.</p>
            <p>It came to paſſe alſo, that at the tyme that the ſayde
Captayne came into the prouice of Lili, to a towne called Palo
neere vnto the great riuer, where hee founde the Captayne
Iohn de Ampudia, which was gone before to diſcouer, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie
the countrey: the ſaide Ampudia kepte a citie by him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
of a garriſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the name of his maieſty, and of the marques
Frauncis of Pizarro: and had ſet ouer them for gouernours or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie,
one Petre Solano of Quennoues, and 8. counſellours,
&amp; all the reſt of the countrey was in peace &amp; ſhared out amongſt
them. And as he knew that the ſayd captaine was in the ſaid ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
he came to ſee him with a great number of the inhabitantes
of the countrey, and peaceful Indians, laden with victuals and
fruites. Shortly after alſo all the neighbour Indians came to
ſee him, bringing him food. There were the Indians of Xamun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di,
and of Palo, and of Soliman, and of Bolo.</p>
            <p>Nowe becauſe that they brought no Mahis which he would
haue, hee ſent a great number of Spaniardes with their Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
to go ſearch for Mahis: commaunding them to bring ſome
whereſoeuer they founde any. So went they to Bolo, and to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,
and founde the Indians men and women in their houſen in
peace: and the ſayd Spaniards with thoſe that were with them,
tooke them and robbed their Mahis, their golde and couerings,
and all that they had, and bounde many.</p>
            <p>The Indians ſeeing that they entreated them ſo euill, went
to complaine vnto the ſayde Captayne, requeſting that all which
had been bereft them, might be reſtored them: But the Captain
woulde reſtore them none, and forbidde them to come at him any
more. Notwithſtanding foure or fiue dayes after the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes
eſtſoones returne to fetche Mahis, and to pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladge
the Indians natiue of the ſoyle as before time.
Wherefore, they ſeeing that the Captayne kepte no faith with
them: all the Countrie aroſe and reuolted from the Spaniſhe,
whereof enſued greate dammage, and GOD and the
<pb facs="tcp:5172:59"/>
kings maieſtie offended: and by this meanes the countrie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
diſpeopled: for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Olomas &amp; the Manipos their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
which are mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine people, &amp; warlike, deſcended dayly to
take and rob them, when they perceiued the citie and places of
their abode left deſtitute. And amongſt them, hee who was the
ſtronger, did eate vp his fellowe, for all dyed for famine. This
done, the captaine came to the citie of Ampudia, where hee was
receiued for generall, and ſeuen dayes after from thence hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
to goe towards the harbour of Lili and Peti, with more
then two hundred horſmen and footemen. After this, that ſaide
is, the ſaide chiefe gouernour ſent his captaines of one ſide and
other, to bid cruell battayle to the natiue India<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: ſtaying a great
number of them as wel men as women: burning alſo their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and ſpoiling their goods. This indured a good many dayes.
And the ſaide captaine was gone towardes a citie named Yee,
withall the Indians whome they had taken in Lili, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſing
any one: and beeing come to the ſaide Yee, hee ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continent
Spaniardes to pilladge, take and ſtay all the Indians
men and women, that they coulde take: thus they burned moe
then an hundred. From this place they goe to a Citie called
Tukilicui, from whence the Cacike of the place yeeded foorth
incontinent in peace, a number of Indians going before him.
The captaine demaunded golde of him and of his Indians. The
Cacik told him that hee had but a ſmall deale, and that whiche
he had ſhould be giuen him: &amp; immediatly al began to giue him
all that they had. Whereupon the ſayde captaine gaue vnto
euery of them a ticket, with the name of the ſaide Indian for a
teſtimoniall that hee had giuen him golde: affirming that hee
which ſhoulde haue neuer a ticket, ſhould bee caſt to the dogs
to bee deuoured, becauſe hee gaue him no golde. Whereupon
the Indians for feare y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were put in, gaue him all the gold
that they were able: &amp; thoſe which had none fled into the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
and other townes for feare to be ſlaine. By reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
periſhed a great number of the natiue inhabitants of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie.
And ſhortly after the ſaid captaine commanded the Cacike
to ſende two Indians to another citie named Dagna, to will
them that they ſhoulde come in peace, and bring him golde in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance
<pb facs="tcp:5172:60"/>
bundance. And comming to another citie, he ſent that night ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Spaniardes to take the Indians, and namely of Tulilicui.
So as they brought the next morrow aboue an hundred perſons:
and all thoſe which could beare burdens, they tooke them for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
ſelues, and for their ſouldiers, and put them to the chaine, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they dyed all. And the ſaide captaine gaue the little children
vnto the ſaid Cacik Tulilicui that hee ſhould eate them: and in
truth the ſkinnes of thoſe children are kept in the houſe of the
ſaide Cacik Tulilicui full of aſhes: and ſo departed hee from
thence without an interpreter, and went towardes the Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Calile, where he ioyned himſelfe vnto the captaine Iohn
de Ampudia, who had ſent him to diſcouer another way, dooing
both of them great outrages, and much miſchiefe vnto the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of the countrie where they became. And the ſaid Iohn
de Ampudia came vnto a Citie, the Cacik and Lorde whereof
called Bitacur had cauſed to make certaine ditches to defende
himſelfe, and there fell into the ſame two horſes, the one of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonie
Rodondos, the other of Marc Marqueſis. That of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos
Marquis died, the other not. For which cauſe the ſaid Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudia
commaunded to take all the Indians men and women
that might be: And therupon tooke &amp; laid together more then an
hundred perſons, whome they caſt aliue into thoſe ditches and
ſlue them, and brent withal more then an hundred houſes in the
ſaid citie. And in that maner met in a great Citie, where with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſommoning (the Indians being at peace, and without anye
ſpokeſman to goe betweene them,) they ſlue with their ſpeares
a great number of them, making on them mortall warre. And
as it is ſaid, ſoone after they were met, the ſaide Ampudia tolde
the Captaine what hee had done in Bitaco, and howe hee caſt ſo
many into the ditches: and the ſayd captaine aunſwered, that it
was well done, and that he for his part had done as much at the
riuer of Bamba when hee entred the ſame, which is in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince
of Quito, and that hee had flong into the ditches moe then
two hundred perſons, and there they ſtayed warring on all the
countrie. Soone after hee entred into the Prouince of Bitu, or
Anzerma: in making cruell warre with fire and blood till they
<pb facs="tcp:5172:60"/>
came as farre as vnto the ſalt houſes. And from thence hee ſent
Frauncis Garcia before him to pilladge, who made cruel warre
on the naturall inhabitants of the Countrie as hee had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him. The Indians came vnto him two and two, making
ſignes, that they demaunded peace on the behalfe of the whole
Countrie: alleadging that they woulde afoord him, all that hee
coulde reaſonably demaund, were it golde, or women, or victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
only that they woulde not kill them, as indeede it was a
troth. For themſelues afterwardes confeſſed it to be ſo. But the
ſaide Frauncis Garcia, bid them get them packing: Telling
them moreouer that they were a ſort of drunkardes, and that he
vnder ſtood them not, and ſo returned hee to the place where the
ſaide Captaine was, and they made a complot, to ouerrunne all
the Prouince, making cruell warre on all the Countrie, in ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
robbing, and ſlaying all: and with the ſouldiers, which hee
brought with him drewe thence moe then two thouſand ſoules,
and all thoſe dyed in the chaine. Before departing the place
which he had peopled, they ſlue moe then fiue hundred perſons.
And ſo returned to the Prouince of Calili. And by the way if
any Inde or Indeſſe were weary, in ſuch ſort that they could not
paſſe any further, they did incontinently head them, paring it off
from the ſhoulders euen with the chaine, to the ende not to take
the paines to open the locke thereof: and to the end that others
which went the ſame way ſhoulde not make wiſe to be ſicke, and
by this meanes dyed they all: and in the high wayes were lefte
all thoſe people which he made his purchaſe of out of Quito, &amp;
of Paſto, and of Quilla Cangua, and of Para, and of Popayan,
and of Lili, and of Cali, and of Anzerma, and a great number
of people dyed. Alſo immediately vpon theyr returne vnto
the great Citie, they entred into it, ſtaying all that they could:
taking in that day moe then three hundreth perſons.</p>
            <p>Hee ſent from the Prouince of Lili, the ſaide Captaine
Iohn de Ampidia, with very manye ſouldiers vnto the lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynges
and peopled places of Lili: to the ende that they
ſhoulde take all the Indes and Indeſſes they coulde: And
that they ſhoulde bring them vnto him to ſerue for loadyng:
<pb facs="tcp:5172:61"/>
for becauſe that al thoſe which he brought him before time from
Anzerma &amp; from Alli, were dead, whiche were great numbers.
And the ſaide Iohn de Ampudia brought moe then a thouſande
perſons, and ſiue very many. The captaine thus tooke as many
as he needed to ſerue his turne, and gaue the reſt vnto the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
which confined them to the chayne in whiche they dyed.
So diſpeopling the ſaid citie of Spaniardes and inbornes of
the countrie, both in ſo great a number, as appeareth by the few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the folke, that are remanent: he departed thence to goe
to Popayan, &amp; left in the way a Spaniarde named Martine A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guirr,
who was not able to follow the reſt. And beeing come to
Popayan, he placed there a garriſon, and began to root out and
rob thoſe Indians there, in the order that he had kept elswhere.
And hee erected there a mynt royall, melting all the golde hee
coulde come by, with all that, that Iohn de Ampudia had before
he came vnto him, and without keeping any other audit or recko<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning, and without giuing any part to any ſouldier, taking the
whole to his owne vſe, except a little as came in his head to giue
vnto ſuch as had loſt theyr horſes. And this done, bereauing the
kings Maieſtie of his fift part, ſaid he went to Cuſto, there to
giue in his account and audit vnto the gouernour. But in deede
he went to Quito, taking by the way very many Indians, men
and women, which all dyed by the way, or at the place at Quito.
Ouer and beſides that, he altered the coyne royall of the mynt,
which he had made. Here is to be remembred a word, which this
man ſpake of himſelfe, as one not ignorant of ſo many euils and

<pb facs="tcp:5172:62"/>
they ſay they doe ſuſteine, is, that after the Indians are taught &amp;
become Chriſtians, they take vppon them as maſters, pretending
more knowledge then they haue, &amp; therefore will not be ſo ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiceable
as afore.</p>
               <p>The Spaniards require no more of the Indians but authority
to commaund them, and that they worſhip them as Gods.</p>

doe they poſſeſſe the Indians. One appointeth them to labour a
peece of lande: another ſendeth them to the mines loaden like
beaſtes: another hyreth them by two and two as they were
moyles to carry burdens thirtie, fortie, fiftie, a hundred or two
hundred miles out right. And this haue we ſeen to be a daily vſe:
heereof commeth, it that the Indians cannot heare Gods word,

very ſtrange bondſlaues. They haue ſubuerted and diſperſed
great townes, and a whole worlde of people, ſo as they haue not
left any houſes ſtanding together, no not ſo much as the children
with the fathers. The Spaniards make no more account, neither
haue any more regard of conuerting the Indians, then if al thoſe

that trauaile to the Indies, howe noble or valiant ſo euer

trauaile to the Indies for any other purpoſe but to ſatisfie their
owne deſires and couetous affections, being for the moſt Parte
vicious, corrupt, vnhoneſt, and diſordinate perſons: ſo as he that
would way them in an equal ballance, &amp; compare them with the
Indians, ſhoulde finde the Indians without compariſon, more
vertuous and holy then them. For the Indians what infidels ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

haue foureteene or more, which Gods commandementes
do forbid. The Indians deuoure no mans goods, they doe no
man wrong: they doe not vexe, trouble, or ſlay any, where them
ſelues doe ſee the Spaniardes commit all ſinnes, iniquities, and
treacheries, that man can commit againſt all equitie and iuſtice,
To bee briefe, the Indians doe not beleeue any thing, but doe
mocke at all that is ſhewed them of God, beeing in trueth fully
rooted in this opinion of our God, that he is the worſt, the moſt
vniuſt and the moſt wicked of all Gods, becauſe he hath ſuch ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants:
alſo concerning your maieſtie, they thinke you the moſt
vniuſt and cruell of all kinges, becauſe you doe both ſende thither

doth feed vpon humane fleſh and blood. We know theſe things
to be very new and ſtrange to your highnes, but yet there they
be very vſuall and auncient. Many like matters which with our

Lords of the towns and countreys, he parted them among thoſe
to whom he wiſhed moſt wealth and commoditie, vſing in his

had any breath in their bodies. He gaue leue to take away maried
men, and to make them drawe golde, ten, twentie, thirtie, fourty,

houſes and graunges, in great labours about gathering of great

to heape together the earth whiche they doe digge, and rayſe
foure handfull hie, and twelue foote ſquare, that is a giaunts la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,

about him whome hee called Viſitors, vnto whome alſo beſides

townes were the greateſt executioners, as being more cruel then
the reſt, before whom <hi>Athuaziles del campo</hi> brought all ſuche
as had bin taken in this chaſe. The accuſer, hee that had them in
commaund, was preſent, and accuſed them, ſaying: <hi>This Indian
or thoſe Indians are dogs, &amp; wil do no ſeruice, but do dayly run
to the mountaines, there to become loyterers &amp; vagaboundes:</hi>
And therfore required they might be puniſhed. Then the viſitor
with his own hands bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to a pale, &amp; taking a pitched cord,
in the Gallies called an Eele, which is as it were an iron rod, gaue
them ſo many ſtripes, &amp; bet them ſo cruelly, that the blood run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
downe diuers parts of their bodies, they were left for dead.
God is witneſſe of the cruelties committed among thoſe lambs:
I am perſwaded that of the thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d part I can not rehearſe one,
neither can any other tell it as it ought. The labour that they
were put vnto, was to drawe golde, whereto they had need haue
men of iron. For they muſt turne the mountaines 1000. times
vpſide downe, digging and hewing the rockes, and waſhing, and
clenſing the gold it ſelfe in the riuers, where they ſhall continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ſtand in the water vntill they bruſt, and rent their bodies e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in pieces. Alſo whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Mines peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture doe flow with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
then muſt they alſo beſides all other laboures, drawe it out
with their armes. To be briefe, the better to comprehend the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
that is emploid about gathering golde and ſiluer, it may
pleaſe your Maieſtie to conſider, that the heathen Emperours (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
to death) neuer condemned the Martyres to greater tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
then to mining for mettall: ſometimes they were kept
a whole yeere at the mines: but afterward perceiuing howe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
periſhed there, they decreed that they mine for golde but
fiue moneths, which was fourtie dayes in melting, during which
time they tooke ſome reſt.</p>
               <p>And what was their reſt? They during thoſe fourtie dayes,
made heapes of that which they ſhoulde eate, that is, they dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the earth, and caſt it on heapes as is aforeſaide, whiche la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
doeth exceede, dreſſing of vines, or tilling of the earth.
<pb facs="tcp:5172:67"/>
Throughout the yere they neuer knew holiday, neither might be
ſuffered from labour little or much. Beſides that during all this
toyle, they neuer had ſufficient food, no not of <hi>Cacabi</hi> whiche is
the common countrie bread, and being made of rootes doth but
ſmally nouriſh except there be ſome fiſh or fleſh to eate withal.
Moreouer, they gaue them of that countrie pepper, and <hi>Aies,</hi>
which be rootes like vnto nauetes, roſted or ſodden. But ſome
Spaniarde, peraduenture meaning to ſeeme liberall in their
diet woulde weekely kill a hogge for 50. <hi>Indians,</hi> whereof the
<hi>Aliniero</hi> would conſume two quarters, and part the other two
among the <hi>Indians,</hi> giuing daily to euery man as great a peece as
the <hi>Iacekins</hi> doe giue of holy bread in their Churches. Some
there were that through nigardlineſſe wanting meate to giue
them, woulde ſend them two or three dayes abroade into the
fieldes and mountaines, to feed where they might ſatisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
with ſuch fruite as hang on the trees, and then vppon the
force of that which they brought in their guttes, woulde force
them to labour two or three dayes more without giuing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any
one morſell to eate. For the loue of God therefore, let your
Maieſtie thinke what ſubſtance or ſtrength thoſe bodies naturally
ſo delicate and feeble, and nowe almoſt conſumed and oppreſſed
with theſe trauailes, could gather of this food: alſo how it were
poſſible for thoſe that liued ſo ſorowfull, heauie and woeful alife,
in ſuch labour without food ſhoulde liue long. The gouernour
commanded they ſhoulde bee paide their day wages and expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
for any labour or ſeruice that they ſhoulde doe to the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arde,
and their wages was three blanckes euery two dayes, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
in the yeere amounted to halfe a <hi>Caſtelin,</hi> that is worth 225
<hi>Maruedies:</hi> wherewith they might buye a Combe, a looking
glaſſe, and a paire of blew or greene beades. Yea, many yeeres
they had nothing at all paide them, but hunger and ſtripes did ſo
abound, that the <hi>Indians</hi> regarded none of this, neither ſought
any more but euen once to get a good meales meat, or to die for
all, as wiſhing to forſake ſo deſperate a life. He depriued them of
their libertie, ſuffering the Spaniards to keepe them in ſuch bitter
bondage and priſon as no man that had ſeene it, would or coulde
once thinke for: not leauing them any thing in this worlde free
<pb facs="tcp:5172:68"/>
to vſe at their pleaſures: yea, notwithſtanding the beaſtes haue
ſome time reſt, and bee ſuffered to feede abrode in the fieldes, yet
woulde not theſe Spaniards that we ſpeake of, graunt the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
any time or leaſure ſo to doe: but the gouernour himſelfe
would force them to an obſolute, perpetuall, forced, &amp; vnwilling
bondage. For they neuer had their free wil to do any thing at al of
themſelues, becauſe the Spaniards couetouſnes, crueltie and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie,
was ſtil forcing them to ſome labour, not as captiues, but as
beaſts, that are led bound to do whatſoeuer man will appoint. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
if at any time they were ſuffered to depart to their houſes
to reſt them, then ſhould they there find neither wife, children,
nor food: as alſo although they had there found any meat, yet
ſhould they not haue had time to make it readie: ſo that there
was no remedie but death. Thus grew they into ſicknes through
long and grieuous trauailes, and that was ſone caught among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
as being (as is aforeſaid) of a very delicate and tender co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plection,
&amp; much againſt their nature it was to be thus ſodenly, contrary
to their wont, &amp; vnmercifully put to ſuch labours, &amp; to be beate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
with ſtaues, &amp; ſpurned at, beſides the calling of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at euery word
<hi>Villacos,</hi> &amp; vpbraiding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they counterfeated ſickneſſe like
loytering loſels, becauſe they would not labour. When the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards
perceiued the ſicknes increaſe, ſo as there was no profit or
ſeruice to be looked for at their hands, then would they ſend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
home to their houſes, giuing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſpend in ſome 30 40. or 80.
leagues trauaile, ſome halfe doſen of Radiſh or <hi>Refortes,</hi> that is a
kinde of nauet roote, &amp; a little <hi>Cacabi,</hi> where with the poore
men trauailed not far before they ſhold deſperately die, ſom went
2 or 3. leagues, ſome 10. or 20. ſo deſirous to get to their owne
home there to finiſh their helliſh life that they ſuffered, that they
eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fel down dead by the waies: ſo as, many times we haue fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
ſom dead, others at deaths doore, others groning &amp; pitifully to
their powers pronouncing this word, <hi>hunger, hunger.</hi> Then the
gouernour ſeeing that the Spaniard had in this wiſe ſlaine, half or
two 3. parts of theſe Indians, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had giuen them in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund,

the ſoueraigne and vniuerſall principalitie ouer the Indians: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,

propoſitions, deuoid of all other proofe then what eache of them
in it ſelfe did conteine, the one of neceſſitie following the other,
becauſe I was driuen to ſend them to his maieſtie vnder pretence

I haue ſo indeuoured my ſelfe (moſt mightie Lord) that now
I haue ſet in hand the proofe of the ſaid 30. propoſitions &amp; ſome
more, comprehending the whole in this brief ſummarie, which
<pb facs="tcp:5172:70"/>
is taken out of a greater volume, wherein euery article is more
perticulerly expounded: herein ſetting in ſight only the 17. and
18. propoſition, becauſe the whole ſubſtance of this matter may
be reduced to theſe two propoſitions as to the principles &amp; ends.</p>
               <p>The title here of ſhould in my opinion haue been: <hi>A proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie
tretiſe of the ſoueraigne Empire, and vniuerſal principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
which the kings of Caſtile haue ouer the Indies:</hi> As preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
that it is manifeſt &amp; proued, in that the Apoſtolike ſea
hath graunted it, and that there needeth no other opening of the
reaſons whereupon the graunt of this empire conſiſteth.</p>
               <p>I purpoſe in this treatiſe chiefly to diſcharge my conſcience,
vſing that meane which it ſeemeth that Gods prouidence hath
appointed me. My great age (for I am aboue 50.) being the cauſe
of my large knowledge and eye experience of the Indian affaires,
alſo to giue notice of that which paſſed in theſe partes, as alſo
what was to be done, euer referring my ſelf to the like deſire that
the diſorders that I haue there ſeen practiſed might be redreſſed.
And the rather becauſe thoſe that hinder this redreſſe &amp; are moſt
hurtful to thoſe la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, are ſuch as being deuoid of truth &amp; iuſtice,
do indeuout by counteſeating and mingling that which is falſe &amp;
vntrue, and withall ſeeming to doe it for your maieſties ſeruice,
eſpecially colouring your right to this new worlde, are in trueth
altogether withſtanders of your ſeruice &amp; weale, either ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
or temporall (as euery true chriſtian &amp; wiſe man wil graunt)
The other benefite that I hope to obteine and reape by this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe,
is, that I ſhall detect and vnfold thoſe mens errours, who
raſhly dare affirme that the right and principalitie of the kinges
of <hi>Caſtile</hi> ouer the Indians is, or ſhoulde conſiſt of armes and
great force, entring vpon them euen as <hi>Nemrod</hi> who was
the firſt hunter and oppreſſour of mankinde did euer, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhe
his principalitie, as the holy ſcripture teſtifieth: either as
great <hi>Alexander</hi> and the Romans, and all other cotable and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
tyrants, doe lay the foundation of their Empires: alſo as
the Turke doth nowe adaies inuade, trouble, and oppreſſe chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome:
and yet haue not any of them once approched the
ſpaniſh tyrannies.</p>
               <p>How far thoſe men that do pronounce ſuch a ſentence do euill
<pb facs="tcp:5172:71"/>
ſeruice, and offend the ſincertie and loue of the king of <hi>Caſtiles</hi>
iuſtice, is here very eaſie to be iudged.</p>
               <p>Who for proofe of their matters doe commit error vpon er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
and ſo doe heape together other things both abſurd, wicked
and vnworthie to bee once hearde from theſe men which bee
taken either for Chriſtians or for reaſonable perſons. For vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ſuch as ſtray from vertue and truth, in excuſing one fault, or
mainteining one errour, doe runne headlong into many. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
there are that do colour them with fairer &amp; honeſter titles,
who alſo deſerue to be reiected, reproued, &amp; laughed at: as thoſe
that ſay, becauſe we haue more wit, or that we border neereſt vp
on them, either for that the Indians are infected with ſuche and
ſuch vices, we may ſubdue them: with other like colours wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they bee ſo far from vpholding or confirming that which
they weene to ſtrengthen and fortifie, that finally they lay all in
the duſt. To the end therefore that his maieſtie may bee cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
of all aforeſaid, and as a moſt Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and iuſt prince, may
diſcerne betweene the pure and corrupt: alſo betwene right &amp;
wronge, and withall that he may knowe who ſerueth him faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
and thoſe that hange vppon him only to ſatisfie their owne
affections: and for their priuate profit doe inuent and deuiſe new
titles for his Indies, which be neither probable nor of any effect,
&amp; ſo do hope to come to do their duties before that I were able.
Further for that offering this treatiſe to your highnes, his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie
ſhall bee ſerued thereby, ſith himſelfe ſhall haue ſuch lettes
there as he goeth, I doe moſt humbly beſeech your highneſſe in
his name to accept it: alſo to examine, diſcerne, and vnderſtande
it with ſuch wiſedome and clemencie as you holde of his maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie,
and as himſelfe would doe, ſeeing it is ſo, that Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
hath appointed your highneſſe to inherite, as we doe hope
the ſame right in the empire &amp; principalitie of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: beſides if it
ſeeme neceſſary to be publiſhed in other places out of this realm
I will, if your highnes ſo command me, put it in latin: &amp; although
it ſhould not deſerue to bed ſperſed either in latin or otherwiſe,
yet were not the loſſe great, in that I cauſed it to be printed onlie
to the end your highneſſe might with more eaſe reade the ſame,

Fryer Bartlemewe de las Caſas or Caſaus, and

               <p>DOctor Sepulueda the Emperors chronographer hauing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
&amp; being perſwaded by certayne of thoſe Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niardes,
who were moſt guiltie in the ſlaughters and waſtes
committed among the Indian people, wrote a booke in Latine in
forme of a Diologue very eloquently, and furniſhed with all
floures, and precepts of Rhetoricke, as in deede the man is verie
learned and excellent in the ſaide tongue, which booke conſiſted
vpon two principall concluſions: The one, that the Spaniardes
warres againſt the Indians, were as concerning the cauſe and
equitie that moued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thereto, very iuſt: alſo that generally the
like war may &amp; ought to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued. His other concluſion, that
the Indians are bound to ſubmitte them ſelues to the Spaniards
gouernment, as the fooliſhe to the wiſe: if they will not yeelde,
then that the Spaniards may (as he affirmeth) warre vpon them.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the two cauſes of the loſſe and deſtruction of ſo infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
numbers of people: alſo that aboue 2000. leagues of the
maine lande, are by ſundrie newe kindes of Spaniſh cruelties
and inhumaine dealinges bin lefte deſolate in the Ilands: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by conqueſtes and commaundes as he nowe nameth thoſe
which were wont to be called Partitions.</p>
               <p>The ſayde Doctor Sepulueda coloureth his treatiſe, vnder the
pretence of publiſhing the title which the kinges of Caſtile and
Leon doe chalenge in the gouernment and vniuerſall ſoueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of this Indian world, ſo ſeeking to cloake that doctrine whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
he endeuoureth to diſperſe and ſcatter as well in theſe lands,
as alſo throughout the kingdomes of the Indians. This booke he
exhibited to the royall counſaile for the Indies, very earneſtly
and importunately lying vpon them for licence to print it, which
they ſundry times denied him in reſpect of the offence, dangers,
&amp; manifeſt detriment, that it ſeemed to bring to the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5172:72"/>
The Doctour ſeeing that heere hee coulde not publiſhe his
booke, for that the counſaile of the Indies woulde not ſuffer
it, he delte ſo farre with his friendes whiche followed the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
court, that they gotte him a patente, whereby his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie
directed him to the royall counſayle of Caſtile, who knewe
nothing of the Indian affaires: vpon the comming of theſe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
the court and counſaile being at Aranda in Duero, the yeere
1547. Fryer Bartholomewe de las Caſas or Caſaus, Biſhoppe
of the royall towne of Chiapa, by happe arriued there, comming
from the Indians, and hauing intelligence of Doctor Sepulueda
his driftes and deuiſes, had notice alſo of the contentes of his
whole booke: but vnderſtanding, the authours pernitions blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,

printing of this booke, with might &amp; maine withſtood it, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering

whereto it pretended.</p>
               <p>The Lordes of the royall counſell of Caſtile, as wiſe and
iuſt iudges, determined therefore to ſende the ſayde booke to
the Vniuerſities of Salamanca &amp; Alcala, the matter being for he

to examine it, and if it might be printed, to ſigne it: which Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities

tearmed Apoſtolike, eyther the ſoueraignetie of any Chriſtian

the true title and right of a king is loſte and periſheth, as euery
wiſe and Chriſtian man may eaſily gather by that which Doctor
Sepulueda him ſelfe hath propounded.</p>
               <p>This title and right is not founded vpon the entrie into thoſe
countries, and againſt thoſe people to robbe, ſlay, and tyrannoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to rule ouer them, vnder pretence of preaching the faith, as
thoſe tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts entred &amp; haue done, who by an vniuerſallmaſſa cre
and ſlaughter, haue murdered ſuch a multitude of Innocentes:
But it conſiſteth of a peaceable, louing, and gentle preaching of
the Goſpell, and of an vnfaigned introduction and foundation
of faith, and of Chriſtes principalitie. Yea who ſo euer goeth
about to giue our Kinges and Lordes any other tide, whereby to
obtayne the ſoueraigntie and principalitie ouer thoſe Indians, is
ſtarke blind, offendeth God, is a traitour to his king, and an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie
to the Spaniſh nation, whom he abuſeth and moſt perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly
