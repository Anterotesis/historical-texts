            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:65691:3"/>
it my duty to acquaint my People of that place with my duty and theirs to our Sovereign Lord the King, which accordingly I prosecuted several dayes from that Text, and in the same method and expressions as they now lie before your Lordship.</p>
            <p>Since that time it hath pleased the wise and just pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, to suffer my self, with many hundreds more, and more deserving, to be laid aside as dead men; save only that (through a merciful connivance of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority) those dead men did speak now and then to smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler numbers of the People, where it might be done with least noise and appearance of contempt to Authority, (which we heartily bless the Lord for, and give thanks to Authority for their moderation. In this condition (my Lord) I had thought I should have lain, being upon the sixty eighth year of my age, till God should call me off the stage of this world: but in the midst of dying thoughts, and under the stroke of a civil death, of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

How joyful this hath made the Hearts of Thousands of His Majesties Loyal Subjects, both Ministers and others, it is hard to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press. Vpon this good news, (my Lord) amongst others, I applied my self, with the first, to petition His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Licence; which being obtained, I did without delay fall upon my work, to winde up the bottom of my dayes in the service of my Master, and for the Souls of Men.

amongst us solemnly to observe the Day, the preaching of the Sermon in the Sermon in the afternoon (the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation having been at the Parish-Church in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) was by my Brethren made my Province. I submitted to their determination, knowing that I had a Sermon in readiness to serve the occasion. When the day came I did address my self to the work, (though much indisposed, by reason of an arrest of the Gout, which had siezed upon me in the interim) hoping that when my Sermon was done, my work had been ended; but contrary to my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, when the Sermon was preached, I fell under an honest rape, (I dare not give it worse language) and was beset from all quarters by those that were Hearers, to Print the Sermon; and was told plainly upon my refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal, that if I would not part with my Notes, they would amongst themselves gather up the fragments of what they had taken, and Print them without my leave. My Lord, I was I thought fixedly resolved, having once escaped the Press, never to come there again, there being so many in this learned Age, able to serve their genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all purposes, with the Artillery of their Pens, which I never durst think my self in the least measure accomplished for: but (my Lord) who can withstand a torrent? I am forced with an unwilling willingness in this storm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to throw my goods over-board to prevent a wrack; what will be the fate of this poor Sripling, thrust into the wide World, I know not, if innocency in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and charity in the interpretation do not procure its pass, it is like to suffer; however, it must to the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in an Ark of Bulrushes, and take its lot.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> There are divers things implied, though some make more, some fewer: They are such as these.</p>
               <p>First, Reverence: and this is both inward in the heart, in the high estimation of them, and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing awful and reverential thoughts towards them, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.17. and Chap. 19.27. the contrary for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden <hi>Eccles.</hi> 10.20. And as it is inward in the heart, so it ought to be outward in the expression, in speech, gesture, action, as there is occasion to express it.</p>
               <p>One gives us six particulars whereof this Honour of Reverence is made up.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Divinae ordinationis agnitio,</hi> the owning of Gods Ordinance and Institution, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13.</p>

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Honorifica Magistratus compellatio,</hi> such honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able titles as may best express the reverence that is in the heart, as the Woman of <hi>Tekoah</hi> and <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> did, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.27. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.17. Yet here we must take heed of flattery, and unjust praises, least they prove a temptation to them, and a provocation in God's eye, as in the case of <hi>Herod, Acts</hi> 12.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Honorifica coram Magistratu inclinatio</hi>; such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65691:7"/>
gestures of body, as carry the fairest sign of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect and reverence to Authority, as it was observed of <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s Brethren to <hi>Ioseph,</hi> as Lord of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.6. in <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 23. and in <hi>Bathsheba</hi>'s Mother 36.31.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Infirmitatum condonatio,</hi> or rather <hi>obtectio:</hi> I shall render it, the charitable covering of their infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. They are Men in respect of infirmities, not An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, though, in respect of Dignity, as Angels among Men; they have their <hi>naevi</hi> as well as their Subjects. They do but flatter them that ascribe perfection to them, and will undertake to justifie every thing that a Prince doth, because he doth it that is a Prince; as if the very place did alter the nature of the action: this is to call evil good, which hath a woe denounced to it, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 5.20. We may endeavor to cover the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of others; this common charity requires to our Brethren, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.12. and 17.9. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. much more to our Rulers, because their places are higher, and their temptations greater; but we must not justifie them, least we make our selves partners. Doubtless it is a fault to inhance, to aggravate, and much more to divulge and spread with an evil inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the <hi>errata,</hi> especially of those that are chief; every thing should be construed in the better part, that may bear a better construction. There may be many things that we know not of to excuse <hi>a tanto,</hi> either <hi>ignorance, provocation, evil counsel,</hi> or want of those that should and would deal faithfully with them: and such things considered would make them objects of our pity and grief, rather then of anger and displicency.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:65691:7"/>6. The last is <hi>Vitatio detractionis, Exod.</hi> 22.28. <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</hi> 10.20. but this I take to be included in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, which will not stand with detraction.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The next thing implied in this duty of Honour, is obedience; and this is a singular way of honouring: And therefore the general in the fifth Commandment, which is couched under the name of Honour, when it comes to be taken in sunder, and the duties of Inferiours to Superiours particularly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, it makes obedience a special part of this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, <hi>Wives</hi> must <hi>obey,</hi> Ephes. 5.22, 24. <hi>Children obey,</hi> Ephes. 6.1. Col. 3.20. <hi>Servants obey,</hi> Col. 3.22. <hi>People obey</hi> their <hi>Ministers,</hi> Heb. 13.17. and it cannot be imagined it should be less to the Prince, and chief Ruler of the People, from his Subjects, but rather to be strengthened by the eminency of his place; the greatness of his Authority, the necessity of subjection for the common good. To the Magistrate is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the power of Rule by God, and therefore they have their name <hi>Rulers,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.3. <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.28. And if of right it belong to them to Rule, it must needs follow that it is the Subjects duty to obey; for these two, <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Subjection,</hi> are relatives: He doth not rule, that hath none of right to yield him subjection and obedience. But for this the Scripture is clear, and is not questioned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>Titus</hi> 3.1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.40. <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.8, &amp; 14. <hi>Iosh.</hi> 1.16, 17, 18.</p>
               <p>The command of God, <hi>Titus</hi> 3. the celsitude and dignity of Magistra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. the utility and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> comes to subjects by the vigilant ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e of Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65691:8"/>
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. the necessity of subjection, because it cannot be denied without sin, and danger of Gods displeasure, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.2, 5. <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.21. There be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples enough of the judgments of God, upon those that have rebelled against Authority, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.3, 29, 30, 31, 32. And we need not to go far for the proof of it, if we have been observers of God's provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in our own times. Obedience is certainly a duty from the Subject to the Soveraign; but we must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it of lawful commands, where the command of the Magistrate doth not clash with the commands of God. It obedience be required to things unlawful, we must flie to that of the Apostle, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.19. &amp; 5.29. <hi>Whether it be lawful to obey God or Man, judg ye.</hi> In such cases, though we may not resist, yet we may and ought to suspend our act, using the best lawful means to qualifie the Superiour power. As</p>
               <p n="1">1. To offer our protestations, that we refuse not out of perverseness, but conscience.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To use the mediation of Friends to beget a right understanding.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Humble Petitions to the Magistrate for his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, that our Consciences may be kept pure, and our God at peace with us.</p>
               <p>If this will not serve, we are bound to yield up our selves to the penalty of the Law, and to compensate the want of active, by a passive obedience, chosing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction rather then sin, mourning that we should be put upon it to suspend our active obedience to our Superiours for the preventing of God's wrath, and the security of our own peace and happiness. I am
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65691:8"/>
not unprovided altogether to solve the cases that bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der upon this Doctrine, but did foresee it would cut off all the rest of my work. Besides, we are under the sense of the warm and benevolent beams of our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick Sun, who hath given the world to know, that he carries tender bowels towards his Subjects tender consciences, who must be convinced by Arguments, rather then forced by penalties. And therefore by an act of grace; he hath pleased to suspend the execution of the paenal Laws against such, and to indulge his Subjects of different perswasions, a liberty to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God as they are fully perswaded in their own minds that they ought to worship him. <hi>And for this grace and favour, as we bless the disposer of hearts for inclining his Majesties heart to afford us this gracious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, so we trust we shall never cease to bless his Majesty, and to give him thanks who hath prevented our petitions to him, and given what we impetuously longed for before we asked: And we do profess our selves for ever obliged, not only to acknowledg this superlative favour, but to endeavour to the utmost to walk worthy of it, that it may never repent our Soveraign that he hath thus warmed our hearts with his Indulgence. And shall ever pray that he may never want mercy from our gracious God, that hath so freely shewed mercy to us, in setting both our hearts and tongues at liberty to utter the high praises of the eternal God, and to pay the largest ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments of our gratitude to our gracious King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Another duty incumbent upon Subjects, is the free and chearful payment of tribute and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes, according to Law. I shall neither trouble my
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65691:9"/>
self nor you with the <hi>etymology</hi> of the words, <hi>tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, vectigal, redditus,</hi> nor with the several distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that some of the Learned do give, in reference to the persons, whether <hi>urbani</hi> or <hi>rustici,</hi> or from the matter whence they arise, whether <hi>de mobilibus,</hi> or <hi>immobilibus, de exportatis,</hi> or <hi>importatis</hi>; whether <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatum</hi> or <hi>publicum, ordinarium</hi> or <hi>extraordinarium.</hi> I take in all the just payments due to the Magistrate, of what kind soever, whether <hi>hereditary</hi> or <hi>voluntary,</hi> and which way soever to be raised according to Law.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For this duty the Scripture is clear: 1. We have the command of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.6, 7. <hi>Render therefore to all their dues, tribute to whom tribute, and custome to whom custome is due.</hi> And this was the determination of the case by our <hi>Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> when he was maliciously set upon by the Pharisees, sending the glavering Herodians by propounding a Question to get an advantage in the Answer; the Question was, <hi>Whether lawful to give tribute to</hi> Caesar <hi>or not?</hi> ushered in with a subtile insinuation, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22, 11, 16, 17. Christ though well aware of their wicked hypocrisie, though he rebukes them sharply, yet refuseth not to resolve the Question: And you may see how wisely, and how justly he determines the case, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.19, 20, 21. <hi>Render unto</hi> Caesar <hi>the things that are</hi> Caesar's, <hi>and to God the things that are God's:</hi> Which is in effect, let <hi>Caesar</hi> have his due, but let him see he neither deny, nor incroach upon God's right.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Christ himself he might have challenged free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, yet to avoid offence did himself pay tribute,

                        </gap>d</hi> in <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.26.</note> 
                  <hi>Didrachma,</hi> which was of the value of fifteen pence, when it was demanded, as you see <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.24, 25, 26, 27. for <hi>Peter</hi> was sent to the sea to take a Fish, in whose mouth he should find a piece of Money, <hi>i. e.</hi> a Stater, which was half an ounce, to serve for them both; by which, though to avoid offence he sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the payment of tribute, yet in doing it, he shewed himself a greater Lord, then he was for whom tribute was required of him, Lord of the Seas, that could command his tribute from the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational Fishes; yet how great soever, tribute he payes: and in paying of it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, who might so justly have pleaded his freedom, (being of the Royal stock) he gives us a pattern, and puts it out of doubt as our duty, who can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to no such immunity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Apostle gives a special reason for this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of tribute and custome, because they are the <hi>Ministers of God, that do continually attend upon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this very thing,</hi> Rom. 13.6. It is the imployment of Princes to wait upon Government, as the Ministers of God; and therefore since it is their work, it is reason, as in cases inferiour, and far different, they should have the recompence of their work, and a recompence answerable to the dignity of their place, and nobleness of their employment. Shall the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of Men in the lowest services be rewarded,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65691:10"/>
and taken care for, and shall it be worse with the Ministers of God in so great a service? <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.6.</p>

There lies a necessity upon it, for the service of the Common-wealth; the great things that do lie upon the hands of Kings and Princes, cannot be managed without a great charge: <hi>Tributa illa sunt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namenta pacis, subsidia belli &amp; nervi Reipub.</hi> And <hi>Cicero</hi> saith, <hi>Impossibile est ut sacris tributis non illatis, alioqui Respublica conservetur.</hi> How shall the just splendor and magnificence of Princes be upheld; Ministers for Embassies, Negotiations, Counsels, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence be provided for, military Forces, whether for Sea or Land, towards the defence of Kingdoms be maintained, Palaces of Princes raised or repaired, besides many other Publick services, <hi>nisi tributa sisco Magistratus inferantur?</hi> I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For though it be true that some Christian Princes, have indulged great Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges to the Churches Servants in the Ministry, yet its as true, those liberties, especially amongst the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Clergy, have been abused to the contempt of Magistracy, to Pride, Sloth and Luxury, and the great injury of the Commonwealth. And it is as true, that the priviledg not being of Divine right, it is no less in the power of succeeding Princes, to require both tribute, obedience and service from them, then in others to give it way; especially where the abuse of a priviledg calls for the retraction and abrogation of such Indulgence.

                  <q>We Christians do pray for the safety and prosperity of Emperors to the eternal God, to the living God, whom the Emperors themselves do desire to find propitious to them, besides others, and before all others: And therefore we do pray for all Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, that they may have long Life, a secure Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, a safe House, valiant Armies, a faithful

be acquainted with Scripture, to know what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoveful for them; and to enquire after them and their government, to know what is meet for us in our capacities to know of the state of their persons and affairs, that we may suitably make our appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to God for them. But I shall hint some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It concerns us much to pray for the health, welfare, safety and preservation of the King's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that he may be kept from sickness, weakness, or any thing that may disable him from the free and chearful attendance upon his duty, and most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious management of his government; that he may be kept from all Treasonable plots<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and Bloody attempts against his Person, such as have been endeavoured or practiced against other Princes. That God would lengthen out the thread of their lives, grant them long and many happy dayes, It hath been the ancient Vote of the People, <hi>Vivat Rex,</hi> Let the King live<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and great reason, because it is threatned as a Judgment to have many Rulers, <hi>i. e.</hi> to have the Seat of Government often changed by a multiplied succession of Princes, whether taken away by God's hand immediately, or by the violent hand of Traytors; seldom is there a change of the person, without some shaking of the Seat and Government it self: Be earnest therefore with God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

that the Name of the God of <hi>Iacob</hi> might defend him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Because the Kingly Office (and so of other Rulers) doth require high endowments, special qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications, and a greater measure both of natural, moral, and supernatural accomplishments, then is necessary for other men; therefore God is to be sought earnestly to bestow all such gifts and graces upon them, as may serve to accomplish them for their high and weighty employment; by observing what the Scripture directs to, as qualifications in Persons to be chosen to, or set apart for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; or what the Scriptures do commend in such as were called to Government, in the management of their places, or what any have prayed for for themselves or others for them, that may and should we pray for our Princes and Rulers. It is an honest ambition for People to desire that their own present Governours might be equal to, yea, if it were the will of God, might out strip the best of those that have gone before them in any Kingdom.

And thus we may do for a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing upon all Counsels, Negotiations, Embassies, which have Gods warrant for them, Gods approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them. We may and ought to pray in a special manner, that God would keep the King, and all Rulers, from every evil way, and from all evil coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, because both themselves and their Kingdoms are subject to a great deal of hazard and mischief thereby; but if they do sin, whether it arise from their own inclination, or the provocation of evil Counsellors, (<hi>and who is it that lives and sins not? Eccles.</hi> 7.20. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.40.) then it is our duty to be instant with God, for the pardon both of his and their sins, that the guilt of them may not remain upon the Throne, <hi>Lev.</hi> 4.22, 23, 24, 25, 26. We may also, and ought to pray as the Church doth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>3, 4, 5. that God would fulfil &amp; grant him all his righteous desires and petitions, that the King may be a <hi>Iedidiah</hi> to God, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.24, 25. that God may singularly delight and take pleasure in his Anointed, and that God may be to him his Crown and Glory.</p>
               <p>Finally, Let us pray to God to bless his Majesty with a numerous and great People, because the glory of a King consists much in the multitude of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.28. and that therefore nothing may be done on either part to provoke the jealousie of God, by any sweeping judgment to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The miscarriage of Princes is dangerous, not to themselves only, but to the People; as the Peoples sins may occasion much evil to the Prince, especially where his neglect hath given any life to the breathing out of their sins. So on the other hand, the sins of the Rulers may entail a judgment upon the People, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.28, 29, 30. and 14.15, 16. because for the most part the Peoples sins are the imitations of the Rulers mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages; the danger is mutual, and therefore there is need of mutual prayers, that neither the Prince may suffer for the Peoples, nor the People for the Princes sins. Prayer is God's Ordinance, and it is a mighty Engine by which the poorest Peasants amongst men do go forth, and commence Princes with God, as it is said of <hi>Iacob, Gen.</hi> 32.28.
