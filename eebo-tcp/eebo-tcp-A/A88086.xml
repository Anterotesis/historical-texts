            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ome have been curious in obſerving
the reſemblance between the ſtate
of Iſrael, and this of our land.
Truly, Gods great mercies and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances
towards us, have no ſmall
affinity with theirs; and our ſins and
ingratitude towards Him, doth but too unhappily
maintain the compariſon betwixt us.</p>
            <p>But (me thinks) there cannot be a paſſage in all
Hiſtories, prophane or ſacred, that more ſuits to the
preſent fate of our Kingdom, then what befell Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
by that unhappy King <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> 1 <hi>King. c.</hi> 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
2 <hi>Chron. c.</hi> 18.</p>
            <p>Although Compariſons-run not <hi>quatuor pedibus,</hi>
yet in this the Paralel holds ſtrange: The cauſe of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:113755:5"/>
that great rent in the ſtate of Iſrael is rendred, that
<hi>Rehoboam</hi> refuſing the councel of the old men, and
following the councel of the young men. I wiſh
this were not too apparent in our preſent caſe.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty (it will be objected) ever expreſſed
himſelf willing to eaſe our yokes,<note place="margin">Obj.</note> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>His willingneſſe could not otherwiſe better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,<note place="margin">Anſ.</note>
then to hearken to his Old men, his Councel,
his Parliament: And what ſemblances ſoever were
caſt in our eyes, had the Lord permitted us to have
had the deſert of our ſins, and to have let the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament
have been maſtered and deſtroyed, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all fair words and promiſes, we ſhould ere
this, in ſtead of <hi>whips</hi> have felt <hi>ſcorpions. KINGS
act not by their proper Minds and Perſons, but by their
Inſtruments and Councels; and wofull experience hath
taught us the truth of this, whereof we would be incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous,
when the Parliament gave us timely notice of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have often muſed, what magick and enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is in the name <hi>KING:</hi> I confeſſe we
ſhould behold them as a kinde of viſible Deity,
but not make them a Deity; And do we leſſe,
when in the point of this War we pretend Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
toward the King, and nothing at all toward
God? What was there more common in blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
mouths, to warrant them in their barbarous
murthers,<note place="margin">Though <hi>Gods anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> there, doth not ſignifie Kings.</note> then thoſe words of holy Scripture,
<hi>Honour the KING, Touch not GOD'S Anointed?</hi>
How conſcientious would they be (forſooth) of
theſe words, and make no bones of any other words
of holy Scripture whatſoever. I wiſh they would
have taken the words in their order, and put <hi>Feare
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113755:5"/>
God,</hi> before <hi>Honour the King;</hi> And adde to <hi>Touch not
mine Anointed,—Do my Prophets no harm.</hi> Never
was there more cauſe to cry out, <hi>O tempora! O mores!</hi>
I am not ſorry that men are ſo prone to render their
duties to the King, but am ſorry they make ſo little
of rendering any thing to God, <hi>(Horreſco referens)</hi>
What more common then Blaſphemies againſt
GOD and his Truth? It is but our ſport to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
his Eſſence, and to deride the ſimplicity of his
holy Word, yea prefer ſome humane peeces before
it, making our Tables even merry with ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes:
And let there be but reproof for ſuch mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous
tenets, Oh, then all is for triall of wit, and
arguments ſake; Whereas ſuch pleas ſhould not
hold againſt earthly Monarchs. It was amongſt
Heathens a rule, <hi>Impia conſuetudo contra Deum diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putandi,
ſive ſeriò, ſive ſimulatè.</hi> I have read, that
<hi>Remigius</hi> explicating the hiſtory of the Paſſion unto
King <hi>Clodoveus</hi> after his baptiſme, he was ſo moved
thereat, that he put his hand to his ſword, and ſpake
in anger, That had he and his French been by when
his maſter was ſo uſed, he would have revenged it.
With what more generous impatience ſhould every
Chriſtian heart be tranſported, when ſuch affronts
and indignities are offered to the name and honour
of Almighty God: I wiſh we may not be ſo alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
intent upon the Papiſt, as to overlook the
hatefull Atheiſt. It is known, holy Martyrs ſhould
not be ſuffered to ſpeak gracious words, but have
been gagged, and iron bals put into their mouths:
Oh that wicked Atheiſtical mouths were ſealed to
eternall ſilence! In the Act that was for Vnifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113755:6"/>
of Common-Prayer, what care was there
taken againſt the leaſt traducement and contempt
to be offered unto it; and it would grieve, that Gods
holy Name ſhould be left ſo naked, that every im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
tongue may touch it as it pleaſe. As the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and name of God is concerned, and ſuffers di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution,
I could beg accordingly there were ſuch
Lawes provided to reſtrain ſuch wicked licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and diſcourſing of His Holineſſe. I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
the Parliament, whom the whole world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
as the <hi>great Champions of his name and glory,</hi>
will in due time vindicate it, and recompence the
remiſneſſe of former Lawes, with thoſe that ſhall
have more edge and teeth with them.</p>
            <p>Reader, not to trouble thee further with this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt;
only note, when ſuch damnable monſters as
theſe may be lurking in this Kingdom, marvel not
at the dreadfull judgements of God upon it. I am

as <hi>Shadrach, Meſach,</hi> and <hi>Abednego,</hi> having eſcaped

the <hi>Preface</hi> to this great work. Next, (ſuch was the

to obtain it, (ſuch obſtacles and tyranny reigning
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:113755:7"/>
among our ſelves, that ſcarce we durſt once name it)
Being once got, it was ſcarce a year old, but <hi>Rome</hi>
and <hi>Hell</hi> began to ſtomack it, till at laſt it was high
time to look to it ſelf; His Majeſty parts, and leaves
them,<note place="margin">In his ſpeech</note> having formerly reſolved wholly to caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

notwithſtanding they forbore not by all humble
meanes to deſire his preſence and concurrence:
witneſſe. their numberleſſe Declarations and Meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
in that kind. But to all motions His Majeſty was
ſtill deaf, and rather (ſtill to hold to our firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance)
did, like <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> hearken to the councel of
the <hi>Young men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 13.</note> and anſwered <hi>roughly.</hi> In the interim
all eyes are fixed upon the King, and the charm of
his Name works powerfully upon all Countries,
yea upon the very Houſe it ſelf, ſo far, that it was
like to prove its own <hi>felo de ſe.</hi> Thoſe that framed
and conſented to the XIX Propoſitions, flinch from
their own Act, and fly to the King, (which is an
eternall ſcar upon their Honour:) Poor feares and
tumults they pretended; but indeed, their ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
with the King, and the thought they had of
the utter diſſolution of the Houſe, was all. Moſt
part of the Nobility and Gentry now gone, there is
only left a thin and inconſiderable number in the
Houſe, and thoſe (if you can brook the ſtile) a
factious Roundhead party: But whatſoever they
are, theſe, and no more, muſt ſtand the brunt. In
the mean time, what preparations and ſtrength of
Arms, with all induſtry, both at home and abroad,
are levied againſt them? What plots and practiſes
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:113755:7"/>

            <p>2. The <hi>Progreſſe</hi> will repreſent unto you the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
Houſe in arms, neceſſitated to it for the preſervation
of their very being; they have Armies on foot, and
ſeek holds in ſeverall places of the Kingdome: the
King hath, and doth no leſſe, his name makes room
for him in all places, and that which (to humane
judgement) nothing could prove more diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
unto them, at firſt their ſucceſſes were but
ſlender, Victory moſt hovering over the head of
their Enemies: The then Earl of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant

and thoſe fatall Pair, <hi>Rupert</hi> and <hi>Maurice,</hi> like <hi>Oreb</hi>

To ſay no more, call but thy thoughts to the ſiege
of <hi>Gloceſter, (Briſtol</hi> and <hi>Exeter</hi> being newly taken)
and behold the Parliament, to the gueſſe of man,
quite down and ſinking. But here (good Reader)
with holy awe admire the incomprehenſible wayes
and power of God; the Parliament muſt be broken
in their outward power, that the work may more
ſenſibly appeare to have only proceeded from God:
For ever ſo it is, when He would be ſeen in a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
He knowes our proneſſe to rob him of his
honour, and to beſtow it upon externall meanes:
therefore they muſt be leaſt in ſight, when he will

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> I have lead thee to the Parliaments tropick of
<hi>Capricorn,</hi> and utmoſt Declination; The Degrees
whereby the hand of God hath advanced it to this
preſent greatneſſe, affords variety of rich matter of
the mercy and power of God. It ſtands not with
my intended brevity, or ability, to venture upon it,
it deſerves the labour of a golden pen: But becauſe
I will not leave thee without a taſte (Reader) thou
mayeſt remember, upon the relief of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> (an
Act alone ſufficiently obliging us to honour the
name of the Noble Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and the glorious
City of <hi>London)</hi> the Parliament again began to take
a little breath, and to lift up the head, and ſucceſſes
a little adding ſome life unto them; Forſooth, as
the only Engine as would not fail the buſineſſe,
they reare a <hi>lack-a-lent, a Mock,</hi> or rather as His
Majeſty termed it, <hi>a Mongrel Parliament</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi>
only to confront and ecclypſe, if not utterly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh
the Parliament in <hi>London;</hi> it conſiſting of
the Members that forſook the Houſe, and with all
their gall rendring in their Declaration the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
of their departure, omitting nothing that all
wicked art or malice could invent, to impaire the
credit of the Parliamennt. To all humane gueſſe,
this was like to prove a notable ſtratagem for their
ends, and they built no ſmall hopes upon it; But
what came of it? There it appeared like a <hi>glaring
Meteor</hi> for a while, and unawares vaniſhed to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
the memory whereof, even to themſelves,
ſavours no better then a <hi>ſnuffe:</hi> Since which time
the Lord was pleaſed to bleſſe the Parliament with
famous Victories, eſpecially thoſe two cardinal
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:113755:8"/>
Battels of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Naſeby.</hi> And which is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
even theſe were at ſuch nicks, when the main
and hazard of all ſtood upon them. The mercies
of God herein will appear the more admirable, if
you will look upon them through theſe few Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
following.</p>
            <p>About this time twelve-moneth,<note place="margin">1645.</note> the wiſdome of
the Parliament thought good to imploy Victorious <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> in this preſent great ſervice, the
Noble Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> being ſuperſeded. What ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
and mountains did the Enemies promiſe
to themſelves? They bruted abroad, that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
Army, hereat diſcontented, came by thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
in unto them, their army ſwelling (as they ſaid)
with its greatneſſe, advanceth to the North; as
they paſſe, all Countries ſtoop unto them, <hi>Leiceſter</hi>
they gain, <hi>Gerard</hi> afreſh tyrannizeth in <hi>VVales,
Pembroke</hi>-men beaten, and reduced almoſt to their
firſt handfull. By this time (you will ſay) all was
again at hard hazard; And as if this were not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
out comes about this very time into our
Countries the noiſe of the <hi>Directory,</hi> which gave but
more and more matter to their former exultations
and hopes; my own eares being able to witneſſe
that it was ſaid, That the comming out of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory</hi>
at that time, was as if the Parliament had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
40000 men upon the King. Here now they
ſeem to be at the heighth: But, O the wonderfull
mercy and power of God! what becomes of all
theſe vaunts and hopes? Juſt like a ſtatue of glaſſe
hanging in the aire by a ſmall clue, ſuddenly fals
and breaks to flitters. They had ſuch a ſtunning blow
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:113755:9"/>
at <hi>Naſeby,</hi> that ever ſince they have had the <hi>Staggers;</hi>
and like a torrent, the favours of God have broke in
upon our Armies, that the very Enemies are forced
to acknowledge, that they do in legible characters
read <hi>Digitus Dei.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. It is not unworthy our obſervation, that the
very means the King moſt truſted in, <hi>viz.</hi> his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery,
proved at laſt moſt advantagious to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
the Divine Will having given them over to
ſuch inhumanities and vileneſſe, and all Countries
diſtaſting them as Monſters; by the holy appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God, they proved no ſmall meanes of the
Parliaments preſent height and happineſſe.</p>
            <p>3. And though the laſt, yet it is not the leaſt thing
with wonder to be obſerved, How the Lord pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
Foraign forces: It was ever their ſtrongeſt
fancy, That all <hi>Kings</hi> would be ſenſible of the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and what would not they do? And this with
great probabilities did they preſſe upon generall
apprehenſions; But behold the hand of God as
active for them abroad, as at home! And that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
wiſdome may be abaſhed, rather croſſe to
their expectations, God diſpoſeth things: They
look for all <hi>Kings</hi> to be rouſed, and it is more likely
to prove, all <hi>Subjects</hi> have a reflection upon the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and are taught their way to their liberties
and happineſſe.</p>
            <p>By theſe, and the like contemplations, as by ſo
many Proſpectives, we may perceive the hand of
God even viſible in this great work, whence we
may inferre (as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> of his time, <hi>Neſcio quid
magni Mundus parturit)</hi> That doubtleſſe the Lord
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:113755:9"/>
hath ſome <hi>great thing</hi> or other a hatching, and to
bring into the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if ſo, what can the world
behold more likely for ſuch a deſigne, then this
<hi>awefull Engine,</hi> the <hi>Parliament of England?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am no Prophet, but I dare ſay with confidence
and modeſty, that this</hi> great thing, the Parliament
of England, <hi>may be</hi> a meanes that God hath ordained
in his eternall wiſdom, not only to ſhake <hi>Rome,</hi> but even
the <hi>Turkiſh Empire;</hi> and put up the Kingdom of His
Son Ieſus Chriſt in all the world.</p>
            <p>Thou (Reader) mayeſt laugh at this as a fancy of
an idle brain: But let me beg thou ſuſpend thy cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
till thou peruſe the Probabilities following.</p>
            <p>1. I preſume it will be eaſie to make thee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe,

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:113755:11"/>
before his ruine, and it will be at leaſt a good means
to procure peace &amp; charity among Chriſtians, which
is ſeen to be but too miſerably wanting. Remember,
that <hi>in our God, the Lord Iehovah,</hi> is <hi>everlaſting

            </p>
            <p>But for thy ſatisfaction (good Country-man) in
the preſent point, I do think that our loyalty and
obedience to Kings, is alwayes <hi>ſubordinate</hi> to God,
and we ſhould <hi>through them</hi> alwayes <hi>looke upon</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:113755:13"/>
him, and rather be accounted Traitors to the one,
then the other, eſpecially when <hi>His Glory is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
aſſerted.</hi> I marvell this Doctrine was ſo
ſtrange, when even the very <hi>Common-Prayer book</hi> did
teach it, as in that Collect for the King. <hi>Almighty
God, whoſe kingdom is everlaſting, &amp;c. So rule the heart
of thy choſen ſervant</hi> Charles <hi>our King, that he above
all things may ſeek thine honour and glory, and we his
Subjects duly conſidering whoſe authority he hath, may
faithfully ſerve, honour and obey him,</hi> in Thee, and for
Thee, according to Thy bleſſed Word and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
            <p>If now (good Country-man) thou yeeldeſt to the
Intereſt <hi>Gods glory</hi> hath in us,<note place="margin">COVE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NANT.</note> thou wilt come eaſily
to digeſt the <hi>Covenant,</hi> concerning which nothing
needs be more ſaid to ſatisfie thee, then what the
learned <hi>Aſſembly</hi> have in their Inſtructions. But leſt
thou haſt neither ſeen, or well underſtood them, let
me tell thee, that this is not a ſlight <hi>Oath</hi> deviſed for
temporall and politick ends, but a moſt pious and
ſolemn Covenant, whereby Gods honour being at
ſtake, thou doſt liſt thy ſelf for his ſervice. And
think not this a new trick or invention, but a meer
imitation of the people of God in their extremities,
as in the times of <hi>EZra,</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah;</hi> Read thoſe
holy Books, and throughly ponder and underſtand
them, and I will warrant thee, thou wilt not ſtick at
the <hi>Covenant.</hi> It is not unworthy thy noting, how
that the enemies there ſtill make uſe of the <hi>King</hi> to
fruſtrate the good works. <hi>EZra,</hi> cap. 4. you ſhall ſee
<hi>Rheum</hi> the Chancellour, with the malignant party,
begin,<note place="margin">ver. 13, 14.</note> 
               <hi>Be it known unto the</hi> King, <hi>that the Iews are come
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:113755:14"/>
up to Ieruſalem, building the rebellious &amp; bad City: And
be it known unto the</hi> King, <hi>that if this City be builded,
they will pay no cuſtom unto the King; and it is not meet
for us to ſee the Kings diſhonour: therefore we will ſend
to certifie the King.</hi> So that here you ſee nothing but
<hi>King,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Neh. 6. 6.</note> and <hi>King.</hi> And wicked <hi>Sanballat,</hi> he doth the
like to good <hi>Nehemiah: The</hi> Iewes <hi>think to rebell, for
which cauſe thou buildeſt the wall, that thou mayeſt be
their</hi> King. So that if any deſigne be on foot for
GOD, the only means to daſh it, muſt ſtill be <hi>King.</hi>
But theſe good Worthies go on in their good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes,
though ſubject to heathen Kings, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
their ſinnes to be the cauſe of their
miſeries.<note place="margin">Neh. 9. 28.</note> 
               <hi>And becauſe of all this, we make a ſure</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
<hi>and write it, and our Princes, Levites, and
Prieſts, ſeal to it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You underſtand the ground of the <hi>Covenant.</hi> Now
to ſatisfie you for your common objections, I ſay
firſt:<note place="margin">Obj.</note> As for the <hi>Oath of Allegiance,</hi> it doth fortifie
and confirm it, principally providing ſtrict Clauſes
for loyalty and obedience to His Majeſty. And for
<hi>Miniſters</hi> who have ſworn to maintain the former
Church-government, &amp;c. the <hi>Inſtructions</hi> tell them
that an Oath binds,<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> 
               <hi>tantum licitis &amp; honeſtis;</hi> and
where the lawfulneſſe of an Oath ceaſeth, the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
alſo ceaſeth. Conſtant practiſe ſhewes, that
Magiſtrates take oaths to maintain all the lawes of
the land, and many lawes afterward may be abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated;
the meaning of the Oath being to maintain
Laws, while they are Laws; but when they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed
by the Power that made them, they are wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
out of his charge &amp; oath. And withall, is it not
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:113755:14"/>
all one now in this caſe, as it was in the beginning of
Reformation, <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. All the Clergy were formerly
bound to maintain the Popes Supremacie, and the
Doctrine of <hi>Rome;</hi> but when the impiety and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulneſſe
of it appeared, might not they be well
diſcharged of their oath? And who can better
judge of the unlawfulneſſe and corruption of the
<hi>Prelatical government,</hi> then the wiſdome of the
<hi>Parliament?</hi> and they adjudging it unlawfull, what
oath ſoever thou haſt taken to maintain it, is but
<hi>vinculum iniquitatis,</hi> and ſo abſolutely void; And,
<hi>Qui jur at in iniquum, obligatur in contrarium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you are not ſatisfied,<note place="margin">Obj.</note> becauſe the King is not
with the Parliament.</p>
            <p>I muſt tell you,<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> it is no new invention to aſcribe to
the King, a Capacity differing from his perſon, and
in that capacity and Kingly power he is virtually
preſent in the Parliament: In this ſenſe, thou haſt
heard ſay, that the King is <hi>immortall;</hi> and where
thou haſt ſeen his Patents and Commiſſions, he is
ſaid to be preſent.</p>
            <p>Another thing thou canſt not well brook in the
<hi>Covenant,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Obj.</note> is the mention of the Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed I muſt confeſſe it hath got the ſtart of us
for that <hi>Honour;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> If we call them <hi>Brethren,</hi> they have
<hi>Iacob</hi>-like robbed us of that <hi>Bleſsing;</hi> If we call her
our <hi>Siſter-Kingdom,</hi> ſhe hath <hi>Mary</hi>-like, before us,
<hi>choſen the better part:</hi> And, alas, all this through our
own fault. God hath again and again offered us
this <hi>Honour,</hi> ever ſince the firſt Reformation, ſtirring
up godly men, who have by all meanes and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities

but in ſtead of being heard, have been requited only
with contempts, and all diſcouragements Prelatical
greatneſſe could load them withall. But for thy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
underſtand, the <hi>Covenant</hi> propounds no
Church unto thee as a pattern, but only the Word
of GOD to be thy <hi>rule</hi> and <hi>pattern.</hi> It were much
to be wiſhed, the <hi>Covenant</hi> were tendred as piouſly
and ſolemnly as the Parliament hath preſcribed,
and not ſuddenly and violently preſſed upon ſome,
and mincingly given unto others in corners. To be
brief (Country-man) if thou wouldeſt endeavour to
underſtand the <hi>Covenant</hi> as the Parliament intends it,
thou wouldeſt never ſtick at it, it tending only to no
more, but to procure a <hi>better World,</hi> and thy ſelf to
become a <hi>better Man.</hi>

            <p>But this is not all; it was not ſo void of guilt as
this, though after a cloſe manner, and not ſenſible
to all, it was very prejudiciall, and a ſhrewd enemy
to the Goſpel. You know there was a neceſſity of
reading it; As for the <hi>Preaching of the Word,</hi> let
it get its place and eſteem as it could: And this <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity</hi>
of the one rather then the other, drew gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
the credit to that which ſeemed moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary;
Mans nature is moſt contented with the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieſt
way of ſerving God, and Publike Government
countenancing thus the <hi>Common-Prayer book,</hi> rather
then the other. By this means, whatever tended to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:113755:16"/>
the <hi>more effectual knowledge,</hi> and <hi>reall ſervice</hi> of
God, was accounted but <hi>Preciſeneſſe, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Me thinks that were ſufficient reaſon to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
it, even to ſatisfie the Conſciences of our <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
brethren,</hi> and ſo peace, and better communion
might be betwixt us. Our Chriſtian brethren are
offended out of meer <hi>conſcience,</hi> and we will needs
retain it out of meer <hi>fancy.</hi> No doubt but many
thouſands, in the beginning of Reformation, were
as loth to forgoe the <hi>Maſſe-book,</hi> who upon better
experience bleſſed God to be rid of it. We are
hardly pleaſed with the form of ſuch Manſions, as
our Anceſtors a hundred yeares ago were well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with, and it is our <hi>opprobrium gentile</hi> daily to
change the faſhion of apparels; and yet to be ſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
wedded to a kind of Divine ſervice ſo appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
prejudiciall to the Goſpel, even againſt farre
better means, ſeems a ſtrange <hi>Delirium.</hi> I appeale
to thine own experience (Country-man) haſt thou
not obſerved that the better, &amp; moſt godly kind of
Miniſters, have been ever moſt malecontented at the
<hi>Common-Prayer</hi> book; and the moſt unworthy ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous,
and corrupter kinde, have been moſt main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers
and patrons of it? Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> its beſt cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion,
ſayes,<note place="margin">Eccl. Pol. lib. 5.</note> That if the <hi>Miniſter powres not his ſoule
in prayer, and ſpeaks not as</hi> Moſes, Daniel, <hi>and</hi> Ezra
<hi>did for their people, the ſervice of the Common-Prayer
book avails but little.</hi> Then judge thou, how happy
have we been, and are in <hi>Wales,</hi> that heare it from
ſome that ſcarce can read it.</p>
            <p>I muſt cleer an error which hath been obtruded

            </p>
            <p>This I have often ſeen, and eſpecially under the
hand of a Miniſter, accounted learned in our own
country, (among other wide Elogies) to a moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding

            <p>I deny not but ſome of thoſe that compiled it

the peace and conveniency of the Church ordained
Orders to abſtain from things <hi>ſtrangled,</hi> and from

they confirmed with their blood, <hi>all,</hi> the uſe
whereof they did ordain and tolerate in the Church

No, be not deceived, I know not that it was ever
confirmed with blood, unleſſe it was in theſe <hi>our

glad they had gained ſo much as to have the Divine

one trick of the Biſhops: The <hi>Common-prayer,</hi> though
it was the publick ſervice, yet they would permit
the uſe of it in families, which rather then no ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

againſt it.</p>
            <p>Good Country-man, I have been over-tedious; Therfore
in a word, ſuppoſe the <hi>Common-Prayer book</hi> like the
<hi>Moon,</hi> which in its proper motions and ſeaſons is a
goodly beneficent creature; but if it interpoſes betwixt us
and the <hi>Sun,</hi> it becomes an opacous diſaſtrous body. In the

            <p>2. But this is not all; if we mark, we may ſee his

In ſome places of <hi>Wales</hi> the Goſpel doth

<hi>only way to introduce the Goſpel among us, is the pitching
upon a courſe and meanes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to advance the Miniſtery:</hi>
which cannot be better, then by founding ſome ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
places in <hi>Wales</hi> for the profeſſion of the more
neceſſary kind of Arts and good Literature, (all
which may be without the leaſt injury or diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the <hi>Vniverſities)</hi> Such a courſe would prove
a notable encouragement to our Countries, ſo that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:113755:20"/>
I dare ſay, three for one would mind Schooling for
their children, than there hath or doth, being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
by the charge and diſtance of, the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities;
and without doubt, through the bleſſing
of God, few yeares would afford us a goodly num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
fit to <hi>ſerve at the Altar.</hi> It could never have been
ſaid truer, then of us in <hi>VVales,</hi> The <hi>Harveſt truly is
great, but the Labourers are few.</hi> We can nothing but
pray the <hi>Lord of the harveſt,</hi> that he would incline
and direct the heart of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> that <hi>He</hi>
through them would <hi>ſend forth Labourers unto the
harveſt.</hi> Such an act as this, would be an honour to
our Age; and thoſe that are yet unborne, and like
little <hi>Levies</hi> as yet lie hid in the <hi>loyns</hi> of their grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers,
will have their mouths filled with bleſſings
for ſo Chriſtian and noble a work; when they ſhall
conſider, that when their <hi>bodies</hi> were not borne,
the <hi>bleſt Parliament</hi> was then caring for their <hi>ſoules.</hi>
For ſomething of this nature, or leſſe, we know what
an Elogie was given of the <hi>Centurion</hi> to our bleſſed
Saviour; <hi>He is worthy for whom thou ſhouldeſt do this,
for he loveth our Nation, and hath built us a Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue.</hi>

Well (good Country-man, or any other Reader)
I will now part with thee: If any paſſage hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
thee, I muſt tell thee, I intended only
well, and at the moſt would do but as he that <hi>ſlew the
Serpent, not touching the body of the Child twined up in
the folds.</hi> And if thou haſt miſtaken the <hi>Parliament,</hi>
ſmite thy breaſt, and ask God forgiveneſſe for it,
for I hope by this time thou perceiveſt it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more, then once thou thoughteſt it was.</p>
            <p>Good luck have thou with thine Honour; Ride on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the VVord of Truth, of Meekneſſe, and of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
and thy right hand ſhall teach thee terrible
things. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 4.</p>
