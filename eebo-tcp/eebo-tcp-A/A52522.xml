            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>To the Right Honourable</hi> CHARLES <hi>Earl of</hi> MACCLESFIELD, <hi>LORD PRESIDENT of</hi> WALES, <hi>And one of His MAJESTY's Moſt Honourable PRIVY-COUNCIL.</hi>

               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SINCE the Great <hi>Grotius</hi> and Sir <hi>Matthew Hales,</hi> ſometimes ſoftned their ſeverer Studies with Verſe; I hope Your Lordſhip will not think a plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> Preface the more unworthy of Your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage, becauſe of the Rhimes that follow it.</p>
            <p>Certainly we are bound by the moſt Sacred Ties, to uſe all Means in our Power for the Preſervation of the preſent Government, with which the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> throughout <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> may expect to flouriſh or fail, as to its viſibility. And as Your Lordſhip's Sword is ready, under our Glorious King <hi>WILLIAM,</hi> again to do Wonders, whenever this Noble Cauſe ſhall draw it; permit me in the mean while, under Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips Banner, to offer this Earneſt of my utmoſt either natural or acquir'd Force in its Service, againſt a ſort of Enemies below Your Lordſhips In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation.</p>
            <p>Some of them, being Men of Letters, will yield to no Authority, but what they find in Books; and were it not for the Invention of Printing, would almoſt have been depriv'd of the uſe of Reaſon: For theſe, I hope, I have brought both Weight and Meaſure, and prov'd to them, that our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is as Legal, as it may be Happy, if they pleaſe; and, I doubt not, will be, whether they pleaſe, or no.</p>
            <p>With others, no Arguments are of any moment, but as they work upon their Hopes or Fears; and Reaſon in them is always ſubſervient to Senſe or Intereſt: Theſe, if they have not Religion, at leaſt are Superſtitious, and as the <hi>Poet</hi> has it,<q> are the Men who tremble and look pale at every Flaſh of Lightning:</q> Every croſs Accident is with them a Preſage of more, and <note place="margin">Hi ſunt qui trepidant &amp; ad omnia ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gura pallent.</note> diſpoſes them to change their Side; and time was, when by looking up to the Fane over the Horſe-Guards, one might know who they were for. If theſe Men can be perſuaded, that the wonderful Succeſſes which his preſent Majeſty has met with, have been plainly foretold, and that no leſs are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd yet to come; if they do not aſſiſt, they will not dare to oppoſe: And till they can either fix an Imputation of Forgery upon the Predictions here collected, or evade their Agreement with known Events, the Government has them ſure.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs, I believe it will never be well with this divided Nation, till Men act, like Your Lordſhip, upon more generous and ſteady Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. Whoever eſpouſes Truth only while it is proſperous, is beholden to Chance for his Honeſty, as ſome have been for their miſtaken Loyalty, with
<pb facs="tcp:62495:3"/>
which ſpecious Pretence, they have varniſh'd over a long Series of the moſt <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> the Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> and Sir <hi>Ro. Arkyns</hi> upon the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s Trial, and Mr. <hi>Hawles's</hi> Remarks upon that and others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> illegal and barbarous Actions, that ever were the Reproach of any Civiliz'd Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder that Rage Your Lordſhip ſuffer'd; and not to have ſuffer'd, would have been enough to have brought Your Fame in queſtion; when it was hardly poſſible for one of ſo great a Figure to live in ſafety, without ſuch ſhameful Compliances, as our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Spirits were never guilty of in the darkeſt Ages of Popery.</p>
            <p>Theſe things, I am confident, Your Lordſhip would be loth to remember againſt any, now likely to repreſent themſelves fair to a Prince newly come from abroad, were it not for the manifeſt Tendency, I may ſay, Effects, of their Principles: And till they either publickly repent of, or condemn thoſe Doctrines, upon which ſuch Actions are grounded, Your Lordſhip may well apprehend a Relapſe into the former State.</p>
            <p>The Abſurdity of their Notions is not a more proper Subject of Laughter, than the Guilt is of Puniſhment; yet had they the Ingenuity, by a free Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, to ſtop the ſpreading Contagion, I dare ſay, few would have the ill Nature to upbraid them with their Faults.</p>
            <p>I am ſenſible that I have rais'd many Enemies, by the Freedom which I have taken with them; yet methinks that Caution and Diſcretion which has with-held others more able, who look more at Times and Seaſons than Things, is little leſs than Criminal; at leaſt, they deſerve no Praiſe, who will not make or enter a Breach, till cover'd with Crowds. Sure I am, many la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented Worthies have been condemn'd in Form of Law, and cenſur'd by the thoughtleſs higher and lower Vulgar, becauſe of the Puſilanimity or Treachery of others, or fatal Lethargy of <note place="margin">—Sed quid Turba Romae? ſequitur fortunam ut ſemper, &amp; odit Damnatos—</note> the Times; in ſhort, have been thought Fools and Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, becauſe they could not Propheſie.</p>
            <p>Yet, as Your Lordſhip has declin'd no Danger, where the Cauſe of Your Religion or Country call'd, permit me, tho' not to aſpire to the Imitation, to profit by the Example.</p>
            <p>Many Men above Fears, are Slaves to Ambition or Gain, perfect Merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, and fight for Pay; they think the World but a Stage to ſcramble on, and he that gets moſt, tho' to the ruine of Thouſands, is with them the Braveſt Man. If Your Lordſhip had been of this Mind, Your Valour might have carv'd out a Fortune enough to have bought a Nation to Your Side.</p>
            <p>But that Truſt which His preſent Majeſty has repos'd in Your Lordſhip, is more valuable, than the <hi>Indies</hi> given by unthinking <hi>Multitudes</hi> or <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs;</hi> and I doubt not but Your Lordſhip will, in Execution of ſo high an Office, ſhew that Bravery of Nature, Fidelity by Principle, and Skill both in Civil and Military Affairs, from a long well-improv'd Experience, as may ſufficiently ſatisfie all reaſonable Men in the difference between the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of the laſt Reign, and This.</p>
            <p>For my own part, ſince my early Zeal for the Service of Your Lordſhip and the Publick, in truth, of the Publick in Your Lordſhip, has entred me of Your Retinue, permit me the Glory of declaring to the World, that I am</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AFTER thoſe Great and Glorious Things which His pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Majeſty <hi>William</hi> III. has done for this Nation, had we not made His Government our Choice, as His Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was our Refuge; the Ingratitude would have been as ſignal, as our Deliverance has been, thro' His auſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conduct. And whoever oppoſes this, may be thought to fight againſt thoſe Providences and Predictions, which give as it were a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Unction, and Deſignation of His Perſon, to the Supremacy of Power among us. Yet how plainly ſoever this ſeems to have been deſign'd by Heaven, I muſt own, That alone will not authoriſe En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors to this End, unleſs it can be done without Injuſtice to any: For otherwiſe we ſhould make God the Author of thoſe Sins of Men, which have often been foretold.</p>
            <p>But in order to ſatisfie thoſe who queſtion what is their Duty at this time, either for Acting or Acquieſcing, I ſhall ſhew that we have been Grateful without being Unjuſt, and may chearfully act under the preſent Government, in ſure and certain hope that thoſe great Things which are already come to paſs, according to plain Predictions, are the happy <hi>Omens</hi> and Earneſts, of greater yet to come, being equally promis'd. For which end I ſhall conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whether we may not, by comparing the following Predictions, reaſonably conclude, That as the Crown of <hi>England</hi> has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin'd for the late <hi>Prince of Orange,</hi> the better to qualifie him for the executing God's Purpoſes for the Benefit of Mankind; ſo it has been long ſince foretold?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether the People of <hi>England</hi> have not a rightful Power to contribute towards their Accompliſhment?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Whether that Power has not been duly exercis'd in the preſent Aſſembly of Lords and Commons?</p>
            <p>Many, I know, <hi>deſpiſe Propheſies,</hi> and laugh at the Obſervers of thoſe <hi>Hand-writings</hi> from above; and others, tho' they own that ſome Beams of Divine Light had viſited the dark Ages of the World, before the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs</hi> appeared, and that they were more frequent during its abode upon Earth, and for the two or three firſt Centuries after: Yet they will have it, that ever ſince God has kept his Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to himſelf, without communicating any Notices of it to <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Noſtredamus Natus Anno</hi> 1503.</note> Mankind. Be their Opinions as it will, 'tis not unlikely that many, who have been doubtful what Courſe to ſteer in their Endeavours for <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Denatus Anno</hi> 1566.</note> the Publick, will attend to theſe Divine Admonitions.</p>
            <p>But that <hi>Noſtredamus,</hi> either thro' Judicial Aſtrology, or Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, <note place="margin">The Edition here chiefly followed, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> 1568.</note> or both, as himſelf profeſſes, did foretel many things which have come to paſs, muſt not be denied by any body who reads him; <note place="margin">

            <p>In two Particulars I have taken a Liberty with <hi>Noſtredamus,</hi> which I cannot but think allowable. 1. Where his Words admit of different Senſes, if I have not left them <hi>in aequilibrio,</hi> equally applicable to either, I have determin'd them to that which beſt agrees with Events: For if he has truly foretold any thing without ambiguity, we are to believe, that in others, he, or the Spirit which dictated to him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended what has fallen out, if the Words will bear it. 2. Whereas the Stanzas of his Predictions are ſcatter'd up and down, like ſo many Sybilline Leaves, I have gather'd and ſorted them together, according to paſt Occurrences, or that relation to the future which they ſeem to
<pb facs="tcp:62495:4"/>
bear; and certain it is, that God's Holy Spirit foreſaw all things in their true Order. I muſt own, that the like Perſons and Actions may come upon the Stage more than once; wherefore of many, every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is left to his own Conjecture; but in others, the Parallel is ſo exact between <hi>Noſtredamus</hi> his Deſcriptions, and what has come to paſs in the whole or in part, that where a Connection of Events ſeems to be pointed at, 'twill be as difficult not to entertain warm Expectations of the Accompliſhment of the Whole, as to deny that Part is fufilled: And many Perſonal Characters, tho' given in diſtant <hi>Stanzas,</hi> have that mutual Reſemblance, that they look like ſeveral Parts, or Lineaments at leaſt, of the ſame Face, and may without blame be drawn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>

            <q>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>If God permit,</hi> becauſe all things are ſubject to the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and Will; nor is it in any Man's power to provide againſt future Accidents: Wherefore he who did what lay in him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what he promis'd, has diſcharg'd his Oath.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Things remaining as they now are,</hi> Whence he who ſwore to marry any Woman, is not oblig'd, if he diſcovers that ſhe is with Child by another.</p>
               <p>Theſe two Exceptions ſufficiently warrant Submiſſion to ſuch Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as God in his Providence ſhall permit, notwithſtanding Oaths to a former King: And if he ceaſe to treat his People as Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, the Obligation which was to a Legal King determines, before his actual Withdrawing from the Government.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>As far as we may;</hi> as if one ſwear indefinitely to obſerve all Statutes and Cuſtoms of any Community, he is not oblig'd to obſerve them farther than they are lawful and honeſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Saving the Power of a Superior:</hi> Whence if a Son in his Father's Family ſwear to do a Thing lawful in it ſelf, but the Father not knowing it, commands another thing, which hinders the doing that which is ſworn; he is not bound by his Oath, becauſe by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Natural Law he is bound to obey his Father. And he who has ſworn not to go out of his Houſe, being cited to appear before a Lawful Judge, is bound to go out, notwithſtanding his Oath; the Reaſon is, becauſe the Act of one, ought not to prejudice the Right of another.</p>

            </p>
            <p>This I think I may ſay, with warrant from Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> That no Man is bound by this Oath to act againſt Law, under colour of the <note place="margin">Vid. infra.</note> King's Commiſſion; nor to permit ſuch Actions, if it be in his power to hinder them; the Common Fundamental Law being in this Caſe the Superior which he is to obey, and which is to explain and limit the <note place="margin">

            <p>But I ſhall ſtop their Mouths who object theſe Statutes, and maintain, That according to what themſelves receive for Law, the Parliaments which enacted theſe Declarations, had no power ſo to do; and then the Law muſt ſtand as it did. For this let us firſt hear Mr. <hi>Sheringham,</hi> whoſe Authority few of theſe Men diſpute.</p>
            <p>
               <q>They that lay the firſt Foundation of a Commonwealth, have <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sheringham</hi> of the King's Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, <hi>p.</hi> 41.</note> Authority to make Laws that cannot be alter'd by Poſterity, in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that concern the Rights both of King and People: For Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations cannot be remov'd, without the Ruine and Subverſion of the whole Building.</q> Wherefore, admit the Acts had been duly made, according to him, they would be void, if the Fundamental Law were as I have ſhewn.</p>
            <p>However, I am ſure I can irrefragably prove to them who will not have a Nation ſav'd without ſtrict Form of Law, That the Parliament which made thoſe Acts, had no Power at the time of making them, being by the expreſs Words of a former Statute repeal'd.</p>
            <p>The Triennial Act, 16 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. provides in a way not eaſily to be defeated, not only for holding a Parliament once within Three Years at leaſt, but that all Parliaments which ſhall be Prorogu'd or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ'd, <note place="margin">16 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. <hi>Nota,</hi> There was no at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal this till 16 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 1.</note> or ſo continued by Prorogation or Adjournment, until the Tenth of <hi>September</hi> which ſhall be in the third Year next after the laſt Day of the laſt <hi>Meeting and Sitting of the foregoing Parliament, ſhall be thenceforth clearly and abſolutely diſſolv'd.</hi> Now, ſay I, that Parliament which enacted theſe Laws, had ſat beyond that Time; <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe were made in the Parliament next after the Convention which brought in the King, which they, I am ſure, will not call a Parliament: Wherefore we muſt go back to the firſt Long Parliament, which, upon their own Rule, <hi>Rex eſt caput &amp; finis Parliamenti,</hi> was diſſolv'd by <note place="margin">

            <p>And perhaps its own breaking up in Confuſion before, was in Law <note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:62495:11"/>
of the laſt Parliament of <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, which was the next forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Legal Parliament, according to ſtrict Form; for the Parliament which brought in <hi>C.</hi> 2. <hi>Anno</hi> 1660. was not ſummon'd by the King's Writs; conſequently, the Parliament 1661. having no Power, after it had continued as above, whatever was the Ancient Law in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, remains as it did before thoſe Laws.</p>
            <p>If it be Objected, That the Neceſſity of the Times had diſpens'd with the Letter of the Triennial Act, as to this Particular:</p>
            <p n="1">1. They who would plead theſe Statutes, cannot urge it, ſince they will not allow of greater Neceſſity to authorize the Maintaining and Reſtoring the Conſtitution: But ſurely however Neceſſity might ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port other Laws, it ſhall not ſuch as alter the Conſtitution, but every Legal Advantage ſhall be taken for reſtoring it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Neceſſity was not abſolute; for the Firſt Parliament of <hi>Charles</hi> the Second might continue together as long as they could ſit without Prorogation or Adjournment, and be good for a day at leaſt, time enough to have repealed the former Statute as to that part, and to qualifie themſelves for a longer Continuance.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, They with whom our Diſpute is, are either for the Unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terableneſs of Fundamentals, according to which, what I have ſhewn remains, notwithſtanding all Efforts to the contrary; or elſe, all of a ſudden, they have a mighty Zeal for the ſtrict Letter of the Law, by which that Parliament, which endeavour'd to alter the Fundamental Contract, was <hi>ipſo facto</hi> diſſolv'd before ſuch Attempt: However, ſince the Queſtion is not about a Coercive Power over Kings, but barely concerning Allegiance to them, whenever he who was King cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <note place="margin">

            <p>And I believe no Man can ſhew me any more than Two ſince the reputed Conqueſt, of whom it can be affirm'd, with any ſemblance of
<pb facs="tcp:62495:13"/>
Truth, that they came in otherwiſe than upon Election, expreſs'd by the Hiſtorians of the Time, or imply'd, as they had no other Title, or elſe a late Settlement of the Crown, either upon themſelves imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, or in Remainder. The Two upon which I will yield ſome Colour, are <hi>R.</hi> 1. and <hi>E.</hi> 1. which ſingular Inſtances will be ſo far from turning the Stream of Precedents, that unleſs the Form or Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Recogniſing their Rights as Hereditary be produc'd, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption is ſtrong, that the Declarations of the Conventions of thoſe Days, or the People's acquieſcing upon the Queſtion, Whether they would conſent to the King in nomination, or both, made even their Caſes to be plain Elections. And of theſe two Inſtances, perhaps, one may be ſtruck off; For tho' <hi>Walſingham</hi> ſays of <hi>E.</hi> 1. They recogniz'd him for their <hi>Leige-lord,</hi> that does not neceſſarily imply a Recogniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">

               <hi>Kingdom by Right of Inheritance;</hi> yet the very Word <hi>promoted</hi> ſhews ſomething that he was to be rais'd to, higher than that Right alone would carry him; which he fully expreſſes in the Succeſſion of <hi>E.</hi> 2. which, he ſays, was <hi>not ſo much by Right of Inheritance, as by the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Aſſent of the Peers and Great Men.</hi> Which ſhews, that ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily <note place="margin">

            <p>But this is farther obſervable of <hi>R.</hi> 1. That he was not called King here, but only <hi>Duke of Normandy,</hi> till he was Crown'd; which, <note place="margin">

So <hi>Hoveden, f.</hi> 656.</note> next to the People's Choice, was in great meaſure owing to his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Diligence: For he being abſent at the Death of his Father, his Mother, who had been releas'd out of Priſon by his means, to ſecure the Succeſſion to him, went about with her Court from City to City, and from Caſtle to Caſtle, and ſent Clergy-men, and others of Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, with the People into the ſeveral Counties, by whoſe Induſtry ſhe obtain'd Oaths of Allegiance to her Son and her ſelf, from the People in the County-Courts, as it ſhould ſeeem; notwithſtanding which, the Archbiſhop charg'd him at his Coronation, not to aſſume <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bromton, f.</hi> 1159.</note> the Royal Dignity, unleſs he firmly reſolv'd to perform what he had ſworn: To which he anſwered, That by God's help he would faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obſerve his Oath. And <hi>Hoveden</hi> ſays, That he was Crown'd by the <hi>Counſel and Aſſent</hi> of the Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Earls, Barons, and <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hoveden, f.</hi> 656.</note> a great number of <hi>Milites,</hi> which Word was then of a large extent. Wherefore I ſubmit it to Conſideration, whether theſe are any Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the General Rule, or are not at leaſt ſuch as confirm it.</p>

               <hi>their true Duty and Service of Allegiance to their Prince, or Sovereign Lord for the time being;</hi> that is, to the King <hi>de facto,</hi> as appears by the Occaſion of the Law to encourage the Service of <hi>H.</hi> 7. who had no Title but from his Subjects; and there is a Proviſion, That <hi>any Act or Acts, or other Proceſs of Law to the contrary, ſhall be void:</hi> Which being built upon the Suppoſition, That according to the Fundamental Law, the People's Choice gives ſufficient Title, perhaps is not vain and <hi>illuſory,</hi> as the <hi>Lord Bacon</hi> would have it; but argues ſtrongly, <note place="margin">Lord <hi>Bacon</hi>'s Hiſt. of <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>f.</hi> 145.</note> that the Parliament then thought the Monarchy Elective, at leaſt with that Reſtriction to the Blood, which I yield. And if this be part of the Fundamental Contract, for which it bids very fair, then perhaps no body of any other Stock may be King within this Statute.</p>
            <p>To what I have offer'd on this Head, the following are all the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections of ſeeming weight which have occurr'd to me.</p>
            <p>The Maxim in Law, That the King never dies; or, to uſe the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1. <hi>Finch</hi>'s Deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the Common-Law <hi>French, Ed. An.</hi> 1613. <hi>f.</hi> 20. <hi>b. &amp;</hi> 21. <hi>a.</hi> The ſame made uſe of Reflections upon our late and preſent Proceeding, <hi>p.</hi> 10.</note> Words of <hi>Finch,</hi>
               <q> The Perpetuity which the Law aſcribes to him, having perpetual Succeſſion: and he never dies; for in Law it is called the Demiſe of the King.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, 1. That neither that Book, nor any Authority <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> there cited, is ſo ancient as the Settlement of the Crown above ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd; and that the Death is but a Demiſe or transferring the Right immediately to a Succeſſor, may be owing to the Settlement, but is no Argument of any Right otherwiſe. 2. Even where there is an Election, tho' never ſo long after the Death of the Predeceſſor, yet by way of Relation, 'tis as if there were a Demiſe or Tranſlation of Intereſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <hi>Interregnum,</hi> as it was reſolved by all the Judges 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> of which the Words of <hi>Lord Dyer</hi> are, <q>The King who is Heir or Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dyer, f,</hi> 165.</note> may write and begin his Reign the ſame day that his <hi>Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor or Predeceſſor</hi> dies;</q> with which agrees the <hi>Lord Anderſon.</hi> But <note place="margin">

            <p>'Tis urg'd, That the Hereditary Right contended for, has not been interrupted by the People's Elections, ſo oft as it ſhould ſeem by the Breaches in the Succeſſion; for that many who came in before them who ſtood next, were <hi>Teſtamentary Heirs</hi> of the Appointment of the Predeceſſor, which argues an Inheritance in him that diſpoſes. And Dr. <hi>Brady</hi> thinks he produces an Example, where <hi>the Election of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Brady</hi>'s Hiſt of the Succeſſion <hi>f.</hi> 8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>was bound and limited by the Nomination of the Predeceſſor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if he had duely weigh'd the Preſidents of this kind, he might have underſtood, that an Election without a Nomination had full ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> while a bare Nomination had none; and he might have learnt from <hi>Grotius,</hi> that among the <hi>Germans,</hi> from whom we deſcend, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Grotius de jure Belli &amp; Pacis, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 60.</note> did not uſe to paſs by Will, and that Wills were but <hi>Recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations to People's Choice, but not Diſpoſitions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I find it urg'd, That as anciently as the time of <hi>E.</hi> 3. the Realm <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 3.</note> declar'd,<q> That they would not conſent to any thing in Parliament, <note place="margin">

If any Colour of Evidence can be produc'd, that the Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> ſo early as that, ſwore Allegiance to the King and his Heirs, <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> this were to the purpoſe. Indeed, I find, that before this, 24 <hi>E.</hi> 1. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Knighton, f.</hi> 2482.</note> a Foreign Prince, the King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> Feudatory to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> did Homage to the King and his Heirs; but the like not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exacted of the Subjects of <hi>England</hi> till particular Acts, whereby the Crown was ſetled, it argues ſtrongly, as indeed appears from the Subject Matter, that the Homage paid by a Foreign Prince was due to none but the preſent King, and his Succeſſor to the Kingdom, whoever was next of Blood: And by parity of Reaſon, the Diſheriſon of the King, and him, her, or them who ſucceeded to the Crown, was all that could be referr'd to, when they urge the Obligation of their Oath to the King and his Heirs, or the Crown, which appears farther, not only from the old Oath of Allegiance, to which <note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>Nor is this Learned Man more fortunate in mentioning the <hi>Salvo,</hi> which <hi>Littleton</hi> tells us is to be taken to the Oath of Homage to a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, <note place="margin">Sir <hi>P.

Wherefore the plain meaning muſt be, that no Man who departs from his Duty of Allegiance to the preſent King, ſhall ſave himſelf by pleading, that he had been in Arms, or had done him any ſignal Service. In ſhort, this was to be no <hi>Corban,</hi> to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for any following Departure from Duty.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I think I have, with due regard to all colourable Objections, made <note place="margin">That the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> were lately reſtor'd to a qualified Choice.</note> it appear, That Allegiance may in ſome Caſes be withdrawn from one who had been King, till the occaſion of ſuch Withdrawing, or Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon it.</p>
            <p>And this I have done, not only from the Equity and reſerved Caſes neceſſarily implied, but from the expreſs Original and continuing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract between Prince and People; which, with the Legal Judicature impowred to determine concerning it, I have likewiſe ſhewn, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified, by the Cuſtom of the Kingdom, both before the reputed Conqueſt, and ſince: And have occaſionally proved, That tho' Oaths of Allegiance may reach to Heirs according to ſpecial Limitations, as was 26 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. yet in common intendment, by Heirs of a King or Crown no more is meant, than ſuch as ſucceed to it according to the Law poſitive, or implied: And that whoever comes to the Crown upon either, Allegiance is as much due to him by the Law of God and Nature, as it was to the nigheſt in Blood: Or, to uſe the Words of <hi>Biſhop Sanderſon,</hi> 
               <q>Dignity varies not with the change of Perſons: <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sanderſon de Obligatione Juramenti, Lect.</hi> 4.</note> Whence if any Subject or Soldier ſwear Fidelity to his King or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, the Oath is to be meant to be made unto them alſo who ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to that Dignity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And when the Crown continues in the Blood, this, eſpecially by what I have above ſhewn, puts the Obligation of Allegiance to the King in being, out of controverſie, unleſs it can be made appear, that the Right of the former King remains; or that there is ſome Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Crown yet in force, which ties it ſtrictly to the next.</p>
            <p>I come now to prove, That the People of <hi>England</hi> are actually diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from their Oaths of Allegiance to <hi>J.</hi> 2. and were lately reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to that Latitude of Choice which I have ſhewn to be their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Right.</p>
            <p>The Lords and Commons having a Judicial Power in this Matter, as hath been prov'd at large; their Exerciſe of this Power in the nature of the thing determines the Right, unleſs an Appeal lies from them to ſome higher Court in this Nation. But that no Power can legally que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion them, or any of them, in this Matter, appears more particularly, in that there is no Statute now in force, (nor was ſince the Death of
<pb facs="tcp:62495:15"/>
               <hi>Car.</hi> 2.) which makes it Treaſon to conſpire to Depoſe a King, or actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <note place="margin">

But this is of the Nature of thoſe Common-Law Treaſons, which are left to the Judgment of Parliament: And they who are the only Judges of their own Actions, have a pretty large Liberty in them, eſpecially according to them who would infer the Abſolute Power of Princes, from the Suppoſition of no conſtituted Judges of their Actions. Wherefore the Defence of their Proceedings might juſtly ſeem to be ſuperſeded, were it not for an ungovernable ſort of Men, who either cannot, or will not, judge according to the Rules of right Reaſoning: but as they will hardly admit of any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine as true, for which they have not the Deciſion of ſome <hi>Father</hi> or <hi>Council;</hi> will believe no Action, not proceeding from their imperious Dictates, juſtifiable, even in Caſes of the utmoſt neceſſity, for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the true Religion and juſt Laws, for which they have no Warrant from the Examples of their Forefathers, or Opinions of Men whoſe Books have paſt with their Allowance: Which often drives me to the ſeeming Pedantry of Quotations, to confirm the moſt obvious Conſiderations, to which my own Thoughts led me.</p>
            <p>The either open, or more covert Matters of Fact, inducing the Declaration of Lords and Commons, That <hi>J.</hi> 2. has broken the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Contract, I need not now enquire into. All People muſt own, that <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

'Tis likely to be ſaid, That this out of the Civil Law is improperly applied to the Prince, who, according to that, is exempt from all Laws.</p>

            <p>That <hi>J.</hi> 2. had before his Departure broken the Fundamental Laws, and that now he not only ceaſes to Protect, but is in a Kingdom which foments and ſtrengthens a Rebellion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> part of the Dominions belonging to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crown, I think no body will deny. Nor till they can anſwer what I have ſhewn of the mutual Contract, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued down from the firſt Erection of the Monarchy here, ought they to deny, that he has thereby broken the Original Contract which bound the People to him, and him to them. What reſults from this Breach, is now more particularly to be conſidered. That it is a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge from all Allegiance to him requir'd by any Law, and confirm'd by any Oaths, is evident, not only from the former Authorities, but from the Condition going along with ſuch a mutual Contract as I have prov'd to be with us between Prince and People.

            <p>If it be ask'd, how he could have a Right of Inheritance, when the Daughter of <hi>E.</hi> 4. and his own Mother were alive?

            </p>
            <p>Be this as it will, the Lords and Commons ſo far regarded King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Claim, that they not only receiv'd him for King, but it was enacted by the Authority of the then Parliament, <hi>That the Crowns of the</hi>

               <hi>H.</hi> 8. enjoy'd the Crown not as Heir to his Mother, but under the Settlement upon <hi>H.</hi> 7. Nor can it be ſaid, that he was in by Remitter, ſince that Act under which his Mother ſhould have deriv'd, was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal'd: And had it ſtood in force, yet it would not have made the Title more Sacred; unleſs it can be ſhewn, that the Mother had a Title <hi>prior</hi> to the Act of Settlement 39 <hi>H.</hi> 6. the contrary to which appears by the former Account from Law and Hiſtory.</p>

And the ſame Power is given of Diſpoſing by Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, or by Will, as by the Statute 28. for which a memorable Reaſon is given in both Acts; <hi>Leſt if ſuch Heirs ſhould fail, and no Proviſion</hi>

And in this the Parliament ſeems rather to provide for the Honour of her Deſcent, than (as Dr. <hi>Brady</hi> would have it) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the <hi>Succeſſion to be in Inheritance by Right of Blood.</hi> Whatever <note place="margin">Hiſt. of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, <hi>f.</hi> 34.</note> might be the ſecret Intention, I am ſure there is no ſuch Authoritative Declaration: And the Acts 28 <hi>&amp;</hi> 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. ſeem to ſay quite the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. 1 <hi>&amp;</hi> 2 <hi>P.

               <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> without Iſſue; there remaining no Heirs of the Body of <hi>H.</hi> 8. in the Judgment of two Parliaments, the Realm was deſtitute of a <hi>Lawful Governour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, according to the Act of Recognition, 1 <hi>J.</hi> 1. the Crown <note place="margin">1 <hi>Jac.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 1.</note> came to him, being <hi>lineally, rightfully, and lawfully deſcended of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the moſt Excellent Lady</hi> Margaret, <hi>the eldeſt Daughter of the moſt Renowned King</hi> Henry <hi>the Seventh, and the High and Noble Princeſs Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>his Wife, eldeſt Daughter of King</hi> Edward <hi>the Fourth: The ſaid Lady</hi> Margaret <hi>being eldeſt Siſter of King</hi> Henry <hi>the Eighth, Father of the High and Mighty Princeſs of Famous Memory,</hi> Elizabeth <hi>late Queen of</hi> England.</p>
            <p>Tho' this pompous Pedigree, to avoid all Objections, goes as high as <hi>E.</hi> 4. the Derivation of Title, as appears above, can be no higher than from the Settlement 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. Nor does this Act 1 <hi>J.</hi> make any additional Proviſion; but indeed ſeems to flatter the King into a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that there was no need of any; telling him, That they made that Recognition as the <hi>Firſt-fruits of their Loyalty and Faith to him, and his Royal Progeny and Poſterity for ever.</hi> But neither then, or ever after, till that in this preſent Parliament, did the People make any Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Crown, but it continued upon the ſame Foot as it did 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. when it was entirely an Act of the People, under no Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but from their own Wills. And if we ſhould uſe Sir <hi>Robert Filmer</hi>'s Authority,<q> Impoſſible it is in Nature for Men to give a Law unto themſelves, no more than it is to command a Mans ſelf in a <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Robert Filmer</hi>'s Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Kings, <hi>f.</hi> 1.</note> Matter depending of his own Will. There can be no Obligation which taketh State from the meer Will of him that promiſes the ſame.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore, to apply this Rule: Since the People that is now, in <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid. Pufend. de Interregn. ſup. p.</hi> 288, 289.</note> common preſumption is the ſame with that which firſt ſettled the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, and ſo are bound only by an Act of their own Will; they have yet as arbitrary a Power in this Matter, as Sir <hi>Robert</hi> and his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers contend that the Prince has, whatever Promiſes or Agreements he has entred into.</p>
            <p>But not to lean upon ſuch a broken Reed; nor yet to make thoſe many Inferences which this plain State of the Settlements of the Crown might afford; Three things I ſhall obſerve:</p>
            <p n="1">1. If the Settlement made 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. who was an Uſurper, according to the Notion of Dr. <hi>Brady</hi> and his Set of Men, was of no force; then, there being no Remainders ſince limited by any Act but what are ſpent, of neceſſity the People muſt have had Power of Chuſing, or there could have been no lawful Government ſince Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, when was the laſt Settlement, except what is now made.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Declarations of two Parliaments, 28 and 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. fully bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance the Declaration 1 <hi>Jac.</hi> 1. if they do not turn the Scales; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that the Judges in the later Times ſeem to have had leſs Law or Integrity than they had in <hi>H.</hi> the Eighth's. I will not take upon me to determine which was the Point of Two that they might go upon. 1. That a Government ſhall not paſs by Implication, or by reaſon of a dormant Remainder. But there having been ſo many Alterations ſince the Settlement 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. and the whole Fee once diſpoſed of, nor ever any expreſs Reſtitution of the Settlement 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. the People were not to think themſelves obliged to a Retroſpect: 'Tis evident, at leaſt, that
<pb facs="tcp:62495:19"/>
they did not. Or, 2. Perhaps they might queſtion, whether they were oblig'd to receive for Kings the Iſſue of Foreign Princes, ſince there was no means of being ſufficiently inform'd of the Circumſtances of the Birth, neither the Common, or any Statute-Law affording any Means of proving it, as appears by the Statute 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. which for the <note place="margin">25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Stat.</hi> 2.</note> Children of Subjects only, born out of the King's Allegiance, in Caſes wherein the Biſhop has Conuſance, allows of a Certificate from the Biſhop of the Place where the Land in queſtion lies, if the Mother paſs'd the Seas by the King's Licenſe. But if our Kings or Queens ſhould upon any occaſion be in Foreign Parts, 'tis to be preſum'd, that they would have with them a Retinue ſubject to our Laws, who might atteſt the Birth of their Children, and be puniſh'd if they ſwear flalſly.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 'tis declar'd to be <hi>the Law of the Crown, That</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Stat.</hi> 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>ſup.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>the Children of the Kings of</hi> England, ENFANTZ DES ROYS, as the Record has it, <hi>in whatever Parts they be born, be able, and ought to bear the Inheritance after the Death of their Anceſtors.</hi> Yet this is moſt likely to be meant of thoſe private Inheritances which any of the Kings had, being no part of the Demeaſns of the Crown; ſince the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Crown was not mentioned, nor, as has been ſhewn, was it ſuch as the King's Children were abſolutely entitled to in their Order.</p>

            <p>Farther, the very Statute of which the Queſtion is, cuts off the Deſcendants from Females out of the number of a King's <hi>Children,</hi> when among other <hi>Children</hi> not of the Royal Family, it makes a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Proviſion for <hi>Henry</hi> Son of <hi>John Beaumond,</hi> who had been born beyond Sea; and yet <hi>Henry</hi> was by the Mothers Side in the Fourth De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree <note place="margin">

            <p>But in truth, conſidering the Purview of the Statute which we are here upon, <hi>Children</hi> in it ſeems to be reſtrain'd to Sons and Daughters, without taking in the Deſcendants from either; the Occaſion of the Law being the Births of ſeveral <hi>ENFANTZ</hi> in Foreign Parts, which could be but Sons or Daughters to the immediate Parents, whether Kings or Private Perſons.</p>

But there are two Extremes oppoſite the to late Election made by ſuch an Aſſembly. The firſt is of them who would have all things go on in the ſame Form as under a Monarch, which was impoſſible; and therefore the Supreme Law, the Publick Safety, muſt needs ſupply the want of Form, nor can be juſtly controverted, till the Lawfulneſs of the End is diſprov'd: For all Means neceſſary to ſuch an End are allowable in Nature, and by all Laws. But if this ſhould ſtill be diſputed, all their darling Laws made by the Long Parliament, which met after that Convention <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> 1660. will fall to the Ground, according to the ſtrict Application of the Statute above-mentioned, 16 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. nay, the Attempt of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing that Statute, being in a Parliament which had been actually diſſolv'd before, by that very Law which it went about to Repeal, that Form which was uſual before, is, in default of King and Officers, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by another Proviſion, for the Regular Meeting of Lords and Commons. And what hinders, but the People had as much Power to vary from the common Form, when there was no King, and that Form could not be obſerv'd, as when there was a King, and a poſſibility of having that Form?</p>
            <p>Others ſuppoſe, the Conſequence of a Diſſolution of this Contract to be a meer Commonwealth, or abſolute Anarchy, wherein every body has an equal Share in the Government, not only Landed Men, and others with whom the Ballance of the Power has reſted by the Conſtitution, but Copy-holders, Servants, and the very <hi>Foeces Romuli,</hi> which would not only make a quiet Election impracticable, but bring
<pb facs="tcp:62495:20"/>
in a deplorable Confuſion. But this <hi>Dilemma</hi> they think not to be anſwer'd:</p>
            <p>Either the old Form, as under a Monarch, remains, or it does not: <note place="margin">Object.</note> If it does, the late Action of the <hi>Lords and Commons</hi> was irregular: If it does not, all the People are reſtor'd to their Original Rights, and all the Laws which fetter'd them are gone.</p>
            <p>Here we muſt diſtinguiſh upon the word <hi>Form;</hi> for if it be taken of the Form of Proceedings or Adminiſtration, 'tis no Conſequence <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> that the Form of Government or Conſtitution ſhould fail, becauſe we admit that the other does.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> indeed holds,<q> That when a Monarch for himſelf and his <note place="margin">

Wherefore when the Power has not been conferr'd on a King by Right of Inheritance, or that he may diſpoſe of the Succeſſion at pleaſure, it is to be underſtood to be <hi>at leaſt tacitly agreed</hi> among them, That preſently upon the Death of a King they ſhall meet together, and that in the Place where the King fix'd his Dwelling. Nor can there well be wanting among any People ſome Perſons of Eminence, who for a while may keep the others in order, and cauſe them as ſoon as may be to conſult the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Author of a late Paper in relation to theſe Times, has this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, not to be neglected.</p>

               <q>All Power is originally or fundamentally in the People, formally in <note place="margin">A Letter to a Friend, advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in this exttaordinary Juncture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> the Parliament, which is one Corporation, made up of three conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuent eſſentiating Parts, King, Lords, and Commons; ſo it was with us in <hi>England:</hi> When this Corporation is broken, when any one eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiating Part is loſt or gone, there is a Diſſolution of the Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the formal Seat of Power, and that Power devolves on the People: When it is impoſſible to have a Parliament, the Power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to them with whom it was originally. Is it poſſible to have a Parliament? It is not poſſible; the Government therefore is diſſolv'd.</q>

            <p>Hence he would argue a neceſſity of having a larger Repreſentative of the People, <hi>that the Convention may be truly National.</hi> But had this Ingenious Perſon obſerv'd <hi>Pufendorf</hi>'s two diſtinct Contracts, by the <note place="margin">

him the Honour to own him to be the firſt who would make the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons to have no Perſonal Right, but what depends upon a King in being; for he allows none to have Right of coming to Parliament, but ſuch only <hi>to whom the King has thought fit to direct Writs of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons:</hi>

               </note> Yet, I dare ſay, no Man of ſenſe, who has read that Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, believes him. But were his Aſſertion true, it might be granted, that the Barons would have no more Perſonal Right to be of any Convention, upon the total Abſence or Abdication of a King, than they would have of coming to Parliament without his Writ. Yet ſince the Right of the People in Perſon or Repreſentation, is indubitable in ſuch a Caſe, what hinders the Validity of the late Choice, conſidering how many Elections of Kings we have had, and that never by the People diffuſively ſince the firſt Inſtitution of the Government? And the Repreſentations agreed on (tho' I take them to be earlier ſettled for Cities and Burrough, than for the Freeholders in the Counties) yet have ever ſince their reſpective Settlements been in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as now; at leaſt, none have, ſince the firſt Inſtitution, ever come in their own Perſons, or been Electors, but what are preſent, perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally or repreſentatively, and their own Conſent takes away all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Error.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, That they ought to have been ſummon'd Forty days before the Aſſembly held; That is only a Privilege from the King, which they may wave, and have more than once conſented to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented upon leſs than Forty days Summons.

Tho' this ſeems parallel to the preſent Caſe, yet in truth ours is the ſtrongeſt: For the King then having been only King <hi>de jure,</hi> no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority could be receiv'd from him, nor could any Act of his be regarded in Law, thro' defect either of Juriſdiction or Proof, if not both: Accordingly, as not only the Reaſon of the thing, but the Lord <hi>Coke</hi> ſhews, a Pardon from one barely King <hi>de jure,</hi> is of no force. <note place="margin">3 <hi>Inſt. f.</hi> 7. <hi>ſup. in Marg.</hi>

And yet in this Caſe the Defect ſeems greater, being the Power is collated by one inhabil, and ſo a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial <note place="margin">ſponte tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acta.</note> Form is wanting: Wherefore in this part there ſeems no difference between the Inhability of the Elector, or the Elected.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And if ever the Common Utility or Publick Good, might warrant Actions out of the common Courſe, certainly this could never have been pleaded more forcibly than in the Caſe of this Nation; which, unleſs it had declared for <hi>King WILLIAM</hi> and <hi>Queen MARY</hi> (which they did in the moſt regular way that the Nature of the Thing would bear) had in all likelihood, by <hi>French</hi> Forces, by this time been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to the miſerable Condition of the poor Proteſtants in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who are by no means beholden to the nice Obſervers of unneceſſary, and impracticable Forms.</p>
            <p>I cannot think that I have followed Truth too nigh at the Heels for <note place="margin">Concluſion.</note> my Safety in the preſent Government, which I take to be built upon this ſtable Foundation; and that <hi>Proteſtant</hi> fondly flatters himſelf, who thinks to retain his Religion and Security upon any Terms, at a return of the former, which ſome, who were Inſtruments in ſetting up this, ſeem madly to contend for. But could Men hope to find their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Accounts in ſuch a Change, yet ſurely the diſmal Proſpect of Common Calamities to enſue, ſhould induce them to ſacrifice ſuch low Ends to the Intereſt of their Religion and their Country.</p>
            <p>I am not ſenſible that I have miſrepreſented any Fact or Authority, tho' I have not urg'd them with that ſtrength which might have been by a better Pen. Perhaps what I have offer'd may give another No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Succeſſion, than what many have imbib'd, who will think I violate what is Sacred. I have not urg'd the Illegitimation of the Children of <hi>E.</hi> 4. by <hi>Richard</hi> the Third's Parliament, becauſe, tho' he
<pb facs="tcp:62495:22"/>
was a King <hi>de facto,</hi> if the Character fix'd on him be true, he was a Tyrant, as well as Uſurper upon the innocent Prince <hi>E.</hi> 5. in whoſe Name he firſt took the Government upon him, and either terrified or cheated the People into a Compliance with his Pretences.</p>
            <p>Tho' I have not the vanity to believe, that any thing of my own can weigh with them who have thought otherwiſe before; eſpecially if they have liſted themſelves on a Side contrary to that, which no Diſadvantages can make me repent of: Yet I cannot but hope, that the Authorities which I have produc'd, will occaſion ſome Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, till they are either evaded, or diſprov'd. And being all Legal Objections are anſwer'd, nor can any Scruple of Conſcience be here pretended, without, much leſs againſt Law; What hinders, but that we ſhould exert our utmoſt, in the Service of that Lawful Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from which we receive Protection, and may expect Rewards for Vertue, at leaſt the Defence of it, if we do not ſtrengthen the Hands of them who have hitherto made that the greateſt Crime? Wherefore, for us now to look back, after we have ſet our Hands to the Plough, would be not only to diſtruſt that Providence which has given ſuch a wonderful Encouragement to Perſeverance; but were enough to tarniſh all our Actions with the Imputation of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Publick Intereſt a Pretence for carrying on our own. 'Tis an happineſs indeed when they are twiſted and thrive together: But the Cauſe is ſuch as a Man ought not to fear to die, nay, to ſtarve for it. And how improſperous ſoever a Man's Endeavours for this may prove, yet it may be a Comfort to have ſown that Seed which may grow up for the Benefit of future Ages. Nor ought he to repine, becauſe another Man hath gilded over his Name by what he has got by the Ruine of his Country, or may have inſinuated himſelf again into Opportunities to betray it: Let it be enough for him, how much ſoever ſlighted and contemn'd while he lives, to embalm his Memory, by a ſteadineſs to Truth, and the Intereſt of his Country, not to be ſhaken by croſs Accidents to himſelf, or the Publick Cauſe. Let him ſtill act uniformly, while others live in perpetual Contradictions or Varieties; their Actions and their Principles thwarting themſelves, or each other, or varying with the State-Weathercocks. Let them vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Laws, out of Loyalty; unchurch all Proteſtant Churches but their own, out of Zeal againſt Popery; narrow the Terms of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, to ſpread the National Religion; confine all Advantages to that Communion, for the Publick Good; make their King the Head of a Party, to ſtrengthen his Hands againſt his Enemies; deliver up Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and retake them gelt of their Nobleſt Privileges, in performance of their Oaths to preſerve them; fight againſt their King, and yet urge the Obligation of Oaths requiring an unalterable Allegiance to his Perſon; aſſert that the Power is inſeparable from him, and yet may in his abſence, without his Conſent, be transferr'd to a Regent, not to be reaſſum'd when he ſhould think fit to return; grant that he has bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Contract, yet contend that he retains that Power which he receiv'd from the Contract; or that, tho' the Contract is broken, the Throne is not vacant; or, if it be vacant, yet an Heir has a Right; and ſo it is vacant, and not vacant, at the ſame time: Or that after one has broken a Condition, upon which he took an Eſtate to himſelf and his Heirs in Fee-ſimple or Tail, another ſhall enjoy it as Heir to
<pb facs="tcp:62495:22"/>
him, and that in his Life-time; invite a Deliverer, yet reject the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance.</p>
            <p>Upon ſuch Principles as theſe, I find an eminent <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prelate cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd <note place="margin">Letter to B. <hi>L.</hi>
               </note> as a Deſerter of his Church, for going about, according to his great Learning, to juſtifie the Oaths taken to the preſent Government: And thus the Cauſe of <hi>J.</hi> 2. is made the Cauſe of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Certain it is, whatever is now pretended, 'tis more difficult to juſtifie the taking up, or promoting Arms againſt a Deliverer, than an Oppreſſor. And if Arms againſt the laſt were lawful, even with the Proſpect of involving Thouſands in the Miſeries of War; much more are they, in Defence of that Power which has reſtor'd thoſe Liberties which the other invaded, and reaſſur'd the Publick Peace. And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever firſt engag'd, and now draw back, not only brand themſelves for Traitors, but make it evident, that Ambition, Revenge, or ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous Deſign, animated their Undertakings. And as I doubt not but they will meet with their due Reward; perhaps that Succeſs which <hi>Noſtredamus</hi> and others foretel to our preſent King, may go further with ſuch Men, to keep them to their Duty, than the moſt demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative Proofs of Right, which they generally meaſure by the Event. And as no Cauſe or Action is Juſt in their Eyes, which is not Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; they, in the Language of the <hi>Poet,</hi> are always on the Side of <note place="margin">Victrix cauſa Diis placuit, ſed victa Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni.</note> the <hi>Gods:</hi> But few are in this Point ſuch Philoſophers as <hi>Cato.</hi>
