            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <note place="margin">In prefa. no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ui teÅ¿tamen.</note> 
               <hi>Å¿o in this reÅ¿pect of making for vs or againÅ¿t vs, vve allovv the greeke as much as the latin, yea in Å¿undrie places, more then the latin, being aÅ¿Å¿ured that they haue not one, and that vve haue many aduantages in the greeke more then in the latin.</hi> And this is there manifeÅ¿ted by Å¿undrie and verie euident examples, touching traditions, prieÅ¿thode, iuÅ¿tification by workes,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:15996:193"/>
the real preÅ¿ence, faÅ¿ting, freewil, the myÅ¿tical Å¿acrifice, and againÅ¿t their on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith and aÅ¿Å¿urance of Å¿aluation, wherein the greeke is more pregnant for vs then the latin. ContrarywiÅ¿e let M. VV. frame againÅ¿t the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like religion, or any part thereof, one argument out of the Å¿criptures, which we refuÅ¿e to Å¿tand vnto vpon this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, becauÅ¿e it is in the greeke and not in the latin, and I am content to excuÅ¿e him here of a lye. OtherwiÅ¿e he can neuer Å¿aue him Å¿elf from a lye, and a lye in Å¿ight, to obiect that vnto vs, which nether he nor any of his can proue, and we before hand haue in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciÅ¿e termes warned him of it, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿ed, and proued the contrarie.</p>
            <p>And therefore, although in truth (reader) whatÅ¿oeuer he Å¿aith, &amp; a great deale more, is anÅ¿wered verie Å¿uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently and abundantly alreadie in the preface of the TeÅ¿tament, as thow wilt confeÅ¿Å¿e, if it Å¿hal pleaÅ¿e thee with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to pervÅ¿e it, and I accompt it a peece of our miÅ¿erie in this time, to be matched with Å¿uch blunt aduerÅ¿aries whoÅ¿e maner of writing is now to cloy vs with <hi>cra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>be recocta, cole vvorts tvviÅ¿e,</hi> yea te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> times <hi>Å¿odden,</hi> &amp; nether the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> Å¿elues can

bring any new Å¿tuffe, nor Å¿coure more brightlie or otherwiÅ¿e mend vp their old, nor refel our anÅ¿weres &amp; confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made to them, but diÅ¿Å¿embling any Å¿uch matter, as though it had neuer bene treated of before, vÅ¿e to runne idelly, and miniÅ¿terlike vpon a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mon place as M.

            <p>Two argumentes he maketh againÅ¿t our latin tranÅ¿lation, and conÅ¿equent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againÅ¿t vs for folowing the Å¿ame in our EngliÅ¿h. The firÅ¿t is,<note place="margin">M.W. rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons for pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ferring the hebrew and greeke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the latin.</note> that the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, vz, the greeke and hebrew, are more pure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the latin, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth by certaine Å¿entences of S. Hiero<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, S. AuÅ¿tin, and S. AmbroÅ¿e. The other is one particular fault, wherein as he Å¿ayth, the vulgar tranÅ¿lation is vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿allie falÅ¿e, the greeke contrarie is true.
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:15996:194"/>
Before his arguments he premitteth certaine interrogatories, wherein he Å¿eemeth to auouch (if I vnderÅ¿tand him) that only to be the word of god, which is written in the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>guage where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in firÅ¿t the holy GhoÅ¿t by the Prophets and ApoÅ¿tles vttered it.

               <note place="margin">If the latin teÅ¿tament be not the word of god, whoÅ¿e word are their vulgar tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿lations?</note>

               <hi>but vve haue found not in one place, that the Å¿ame interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> vvhich he blameth, is grounded vpon the authoritie of other greeke copies, and thoÅ¿e moÅ¿t aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.

if the greeke teÅ¿taments haue in them many faultes, errors &amp; corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as Beza in word auoucheth and by manifold examples Å¿heweth, if this be Å¿o true that our engliÅ¿h tranÅ¿lators them Å¿elues at their pleaÅ¿ure leaue the greeke and folow our latin, with what face, reaÅ¿on, or conÅ¿cience, can M.W. crie vpon the pure and vncorrupt ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals, which him Å¿elf and his maÅ¿ters proue to be Å¿o impure and contamina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?
