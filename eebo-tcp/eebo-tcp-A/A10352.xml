            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>One reaſon was, becauſe I ſawe many in this ſocietie, for good zeale
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:15996:3"/>
and forwardnes, as willing, and for ripe knowledge in diuinitie more able, to vndertake and diſpatch a greater matter then that.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:15996:27"/>
deteſted the ſacrifice of the maſſe as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious to the death of Chriſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged no iuſtification but by only faith, allowed mariage of prieſtes and religious perſons as agreable to the libertie of the goſpel, held for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes none other but Baptiſme &amp; the Euchariſt, and Baptiſme an only ſigne not remitting ſynnes, and the Euchariſt a ſole figure, from which the truth of Chriſtes body was as far diſtant as heauen is from earth, and ſo forth according to the reſt of the articles of their reformed faith: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the decourſe of ſo few yeres, al theſe thinges were turned vpſide downe, &amp; the contrary faith planted in ſteede thereof. That is, the Romane church of late ſo ſound and perfite, ſodaynly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came moſt corrupt and impure. ſhe approued the vniuerſal authoritie of the Romane Biſhop, and appointed no boundes or limites to his iuriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which was mere Antichriſtian. ſhe tooke from Princes their Supremacie, ſhe brought in the ſacrifice of the maſſe, and highly aduaunced it againſt the death and ſacrifice of Chriſt. ſhe acknowledged iuſtification to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede not of only faith, but of workes

            <p>This maner of anſwering is not to ſearch out the truth, as becometh Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, or to bring men into the right way, as is the dutie of Chriſtians, but only to keepe mens heads in muſing &amp; expectation of new bookes, to make them miſpend their time, to keepe the printers occupied, and as it were to walke and talke on a ſtage for no other purpoſe but to paſſe away the time.

In examininge which queſtion, the behauiour of our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries deſerueth diligent conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For as in the beginning, they much prayſed the Fathers, Church, &amp; Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of the firſte fiue hundred yeares,

not for any reſpecte or reuerence they bare vnto them,<note place="margin">The proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the new goſpel.</note> but by ſo doinge to diſcountenance and thruſt out of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite, the Fathers, Church and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of the later thowſand, by whom they ſaw moſt euidently their hereſies to haue bene condemned: ſo not long after, for lyke purpoſe, they made vau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the ſcriptures, agaynſt thoſe very firſt and moſte auncient Fathers, not for any iuſte honor or regarde which they had of the ſcriptures, but by that meanes to diſgrace the Fathers, and eaſe them ſelues of anſwering their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritye, when ſoeuer they ſhould be preſſed therewith. For that in deede they accompte not of the very ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures more then of the Fathers, but turne them ouer for vs to defende no leſſe then the Fathers, time and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience hath ſhewed, their publike wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges profeſſe (as by that which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after enſueth, ſhall manifeſtly appeare) and M.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:15996:50"/>
groſſe impietie wherevnto it tendeth, and in to what open profeſſion of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie in a ſhorte ſpace it is likely to breake out, which in the compaſſe of ſo few yeares is growen to ſuch a head, that now already they dare as boldly call in queſtion and deny partes of the holy ſcriptures, as not long ſithence they made the like quarels againſt the wrytings of the auncient Fathers. Let the Chriſtian Reader note I ſay, not their wordes, but their doinges, not their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfeit diſſimulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in ſpeach &amp; pulpit ſometyme vſed, but their eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent practiſe, reaſons &amp; aſſeuerations publiſhed in bookes, confirmed by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, deduced by neceſſarie cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence from their doctrine, and many wayes expreſſed by them ſelues in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry their Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ferences, Inſtitutions, and diſputations, and he ſhall eaſely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue our aduerſaries after denyall of the Fathers, Councels, Tradition, and the authoritie of the Church Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, now at this preſent to ſtand vpon lyke deniall of the written worde, the Apoſtles &amp; Prophets, ſo as they leaue no one ground whereupon a chriſtian man can reſt his fayth, or ſtay him ſelfe. Thus much I gather not onely by the

Let vs heare how conningly you cure this ſtinking ſore. for nothing ſtinketh more before the face of God and man, then a poore contemptible wretch, ſo Lucifer-lyke to prefer him ſelfe before inumerable, excellent, learned, and glorious Saintes of God.

            <p>But firſt, he can neuer geue inſtance that ether the auncient fathers did ſo in their tymes, or that we do ſo now. for howſoeuer in the Councels of Nice, of Epheſus, of Chalcedon, the byſhops ſtoode much vppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their elders (<hi>ea que ſunt patrum teneantur,</hi>

            <p>Finally (becauſe it greeueth me to ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de time in ſuch vnreaſonable pelfe) may it pleaſe you at your better ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to conſider the ſenſe of this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, &amp; to put it downe ſomewhat more

that they ſtayd vpon the oblation of bread &amp; vvine. For thus they ſay.

            <p>But touching our purpoſe, let the chriſtian reader, out of Caluin note theſe two pointes. The one is, that Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:15996:80"/>
and the Caluiniſtes generally, find nothing wherein Melchiſedec ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, &amp; ſo by ſacrificing prefigured the ſacrifice &amp; prieſthode of Chriſt: The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, that the auncient fathers and the catholike Church, acknowledge Melchiſedec to haue ſacrificed, and that in bread and wine, and by that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to haue foreſhewed Chriſts ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing in like maner, and to this ſide M.

to be done, that may and ought to be done.</p>
            <p>But Chriſt at his laſt ſupper offered ſacrifice according to the order of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedec, and appointed the Apoſtles and prieſtes to do the ſame:</p>
            <p>Ergo the Apoſtles and prieſts may and ought to offer ſacrifice.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Maior</hi> is euidente, and no Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian will denie it.

            <p>They who may and ought to offer ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, as did firſt Melchiſedec, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde Chriſte, are truly and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>ſacerdotes.</hi>

firſt riſeth a ſecond note, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> which I wiſh
likewiſe to be remembred, that their deflecting from the greeke, is alwaies in matter of controuerſie, and ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crieth their malicious wilfulnes.

And thus much alſo was he told in the preface of the new teſtament, to wit, that <hi>as for other cauſes vve prefer the latin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In prefa. no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ui teſtamen.</note> 
               <hi>ſo in this reſpect of making for vs or againſt vs, vve allovv the greeke as much as the latin, yea in ſundrie places, more then the latin, being aſſured that they haue not one, and that vve haue many aduantages in the greeke more then in the latin.</hi> And this is there manifeſted by ſundrie and verie euident examples, touching traditions, prieſthode, iuſtification by workes,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:15996:193"/>
the real preſence, faſting, freewil, the myſtical ſacrifice, and againſt their on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith and aſſurance of ſaluation, wherein the greeke is more pregnant for vs then the latin. Contrarywiſe let M. VV. frame againſt the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like religion, or any part thereof, one argument out of the ſcriptures, which we refuſe to ſtand vnto vpon this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, becauſe it is in the greeke and not in the latin, and I am content to excuſe him here of a lye. Otherwiſe he can neuer ſaue him ſelf from a lye, and a lye in ſight, to obiect that vnto vs, which nether he nor any of his can proue, and we before hand haue in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe termes warned him of it, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, and proued the contrarie.</p>
            <p>And therefore, although in truth (reader) whatſoeuer he ſaith, &amp; a great deale more, is anſwered verie ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently and abundantly alreadie in the preface of the Teſtament, as thow wilt confeſſe, if it ſhal pleaſe thee with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to pervſe it, and I accompt it a peece of our miſerie in this time, to be matched with ſuch blunt aduerſaries whoſe maner of writing is now to cloy vs with <hi>cra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be recocta, cole vvorts tvviſe,</hi> yea te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> times <hi>ſodden,</hi> &amp; nether the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues can

bring any new ſtuffe, nor ſcoure more brightlie or otherwiſe mend vp their old, nor refel our anſweres &amp; confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made to them, but diſſembling any ſuch matter, as though it had neuer bene treated of before, vſe to runne idelly, and miniſterlike vpon a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon place as M. VV. doth here, which is more againſt them ſelues then againſt vs: yet becauſe it is my lotte to deale with him now the firſt time, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore am loth to pretermit any thing wherein him ſelf ſeemeth to put any force, I wil take his argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes as new, and ſuppoſe that he neuer read the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the Teſtament againſt which he writeth, and therefore will likewiſe hereafter borow ſome part of my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere thence.</p>
            <p>Two argumentes he maketh againſt our latin tranſlation, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt vs for folowing the ſame in our Engliſh. The firſt is,<note place="margin">M.W. rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ferring the hebrew and greeke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the latin.</note> that the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, vz, the greeke and hebrew, are more pure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the latin, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth by certaine ſentences of S. Hiero<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, S. Auſtin, and S. Ambroſe. The other is one particular fault, wherein as he ſayth, the vulgar tranſlation is vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſallie falſe, the greeke contrarie is true.
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:15996:194"/>
Before his arguments he premitteth certaine interrogatories, wherein he ſeemeth to auouch (if I vnderſtand him) that only to be the word of god, which is written in the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guage where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in firſt the holy Ghoſt by the Prophets and Apoſtles vttered it. That I miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte him not, I will ſet downe his wordes.<note place="margin">Pag. 15.</note> Thus he oppoſeth vs. <hi>Quid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretandum ſuſcepistis? nonne ſcripturas? Quaenam vero ſunt ſcripturae?</hi>
               <note place="margin">If the latin teſtament be not the word of god, whoſe word are their vulgar tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations?</note> 
               <hi>quis neſcit dei verbum ſcriptum illud eſſe &amp;c. VVhat tooke you in hand to interprete? not the ſcriptures? and vvhat are the ſcriptures? vvho is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant but that is the vvritten vvord of god, vvhich the lord committed to his church in bookes and letters? and thoſe oracles of god vvere they vttered by the holy Ghoſt in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin? or can they better or more diuinely be declared in any tonge, then that vvhich the holy Ghost vvould vſe?</hi> where vnto I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that if his queſtions haue ſuch meaning &amp; ſenſe as the wordes beare, and may ſtand ful wel with his ſkil and knowledge, then are they not ſo much fantaſtical as phrenetical.

<pb n="287" facs="tcp:15996:194"/>
Then vvhat meaneth he, and the reſt of his Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gelical confraternitie ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuallie to brag, that they haue geuen vs nothing but the pure vvord of the lord, vvho haue geuen vs nothing but their ovvne contaminated tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Engliſh, French, Fle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſh, Dutch and ſuch vulgar languages?

<pb n="363" facs="tcp:15996:232"/>
if the greeke teſtaments haue in them many faultes, errors &amp; corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as Beza in word auoucheth and by manifold examples ſheweth, if this be ſo true that our engliſh tranſlators them ſelues at their pleaſure leaue the greeke and folow our latin, with what face, reaſon, or conſcience, can M.W. crie vpon the pure and vncorrupt ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals, which him ſelf and his maſters proue to be ſo impure and contamina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?
