            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A true and plaine declaration of the horrible Treasons practised by <hi>William Parry</hi> against the Queenes Maiestie, &amp; of his conuiction and execution for the same. The second of March 1584. according to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of England.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS <hi>William Parry,</hi> being a man of very meane and base parentage, but of a most proude and insolent spirite, bearing himselfe alwaies farre aboue the measure of his fortune, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hee had long led a wastefull and dissolute life, and had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a great outrage against one <hi>Hugh Hare,</hi> a gentleman of the Inner Temple, with an intent to haue murthered him in his owne Chamber, for the which he was most iustly conuicted, seeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe generally condemned with all good men for the same and other his misdemeanours, hee left his naturall Country, &amp; gaue himselfe to trauaile into forraine partes beyonde the seas. In the course of this his trauaile, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooke his allegiance and duetifull obedience to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, and was reconciled, and subiected himselfe to the Pope. After which, vpon conference with certain <hi>Iesuites</hi> and others of like qualitie, hee first conceiued his most detestable Treason to kill the Queene (whose life God long preserue:) whiche hee bounde himselfe by promise, letters, and vowes, to perfourme and execute, and so with this intent hee retourned into Englande in Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuarie 1583, and sithens that did practise at sundrie times to haue executed his most deuilish purpose and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination:
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:14412:3"/>
yet couering the same so much as in him lay with a vaile &amp; pretence of great loyaltie to her Maiestie.</p>
            <p>Immediately vpon his retourne into Englande, hee sought to haue secret accesse to her Maiestie, pretending to haue some matter of great importance to reueale vnto her: which obtained, &amp; the same so priuately in her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes pallace at Whitehal, as her Maiestie had but one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>seller w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> her at the time of his accesse, in a remote place, who was so farre distant, as he could not heare his speach. And there the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he discouered vnto her Maiesty (but shadowed with all craftie &amp; traiterous skill he had) some part of the conference &amp; proceeding as well with the saide <hi>Iesuites,</hi> and other ministers of the Popes, as especially with one <hi>Thomas Morgan</hi> a fugitiue, residing at <hi>Paris,</hi> who aboue all others did perswade him to proceede in that most deuilish attempt, (as is set downe in his volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie confession following,) bearing her Maiestie not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding in hand, that his onely intent of proceeding so farre with the saide <hi>Iesuites,</hi> and the Popes ministers, tended to no other ende, but to discouer the daungerous practises deuised and attempted against her Maiestie by her disloyall subiects and other malicious persons in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine parts: albeit it hath since appeared most manifestly, as well by his said Confession, as by his dealing with one <hi>Edmond Neuil</hi> Esquire, that his onely intent of discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the same in sort as hee craftily and traiterously did, tended to no other end, but to make the way the easier to accomplish his most deuilish and wicked purpose.</p>
            <p>And although any other Prince but her Maiestie (who is lothe to put on a harde censure of those that protest to be loyal, as <hi>Parry</hi> did,) would rather haue proceeded to the punishment of a subiect that had waded so farre, as by othe and vowe to promise the taking away of her life (as hee to her Maiesties selfe did confesse:) yet such was her goodnes, as in steade of punishing, she did deale so gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously with him, as she suffered him not onely to haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:14412:3"/>
vnto her presence: but also many times to haue pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate conference with her, and did offer vnto him vpon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion once conceiued of his fidelitie towardes her, (as though his wicked pretence had bene as he protested, for her seruice) a most liberall pension.</p>
            <p>Besides, to the ende that he might not growe hatefull to the good and well-affected subiectes of the Realme, (from whome he could in no sorte haue escaped with safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his life, if his deuilish purpose had bene reuealed) her Maiestie did conceale the same, without communicating it to any creature, vntill such time as he him selfe had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened the same vnto certaine of her counsell, and that it was also discouered, that he sought to drawe the saide <hi>Neuill</hi> to haue bene a partie in his deuilish and most wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked purpose.</p>
            <p>A verie rare example, and such as doeth more set forth the singular goodnesse and bountie of her Maiesties princely nature, then commend (if it be lawfull for a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte to censure his Soueraigne) her prouidence such as ought to be in a Prince and person of her Maiesties wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and qualitie. And as the goodnesse of her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties nature, did hereby most manifestly shew itselfe to be rare in so extraordinarie a case, and in a matter of so great perill vnto her owne royall person: so did the malice of <hi>Parry</hi> most euidently appeare to be in the highest and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremest degree, who notwithstanding the said extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie grace and fauour extended towardes him, did not onely perswade the saide <hi>Neuill</hi> to be an associate in the said wicked enterprise: but did also very vehemently (as <hi>Neuill</hi> confesseth) importune him therein as an action lawfull, honourable, and meritorious, omitting nothing that might prouoke him to assent thereunto.</p>
            <p>But such was the singular goodnesse of Almightie God, (who euen from her Maiesties cradle by many eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent arguments hath shewed him selfe her onely and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciall protectour) that he so wrought in <hi>Neuils</hi> heart, as
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14412:4"/>
he was mooued to reueale the same vnto her Maiestie, and for that purpose made choyse of a faithfull Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and of good qualitie in the Court, vnto whome vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Munday the eight of Februarie last, he discouered at large all that had passed betweene <hi>Parry</hi> and him, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately made it knowen to her Maiestie: whereupon her Highnesse pleasure was, that <hi>Neuill</hi> should be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Earle of <hi>Leycester,</hi> and <hi>Sir Christopher Hatton</hi>: who in the euening of the same day did examine him, and he affirmed constantly all which he had before declared to the said Gentleman.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, her Maiestie continued her sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and most Princely magnanimitie, neither dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayd with the rarenes of the accident, nor appauled with the horror of so villanous an enterprise, tending euen to the taking away of her most gratious life, (a matter espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially obserued by the Counseller that was present at such time as <hi>Parry</hi> after his returne did first discouer vnto her Maiestie his wicked purpose, who found no other altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in her countenance, then if he had imparted vnto her some matter of contentment,) which sheweth manifestly how she reposeth her confidence wholly in the defence of the Almightie. And so her Maiestie, folowing the wonted course of her singular clemencie, gaue order that <hi>Parry</hi> the same Monday in the euening (though not so knowen to him) should bee sent to Master Secretaries house in London, he being then there, who according vnto such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection as he receiued from her Maiestie, did let him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that her highnes (in respect of the good will shee knew he bare vnto the sayd <hi>Parry,</hi> and of the trust that <hi>Parry</hi> did outwardly professe to repose in Master Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie,) had made especiall choyse of him to deale with him in a matter that concerned her highly, and that she doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not, but that he would discharge his duetie towardes her, according vnto that extraordinarie deuotion that hee professed to beare vnto her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:14412:4"/>And thereupon told him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> her Maiesty had ben aduertised that there was somewhat intended presently against her owne person, wherewith she thought he could not but hee made acquainted, considering the great trust that some of her worst affected subiects reposed in him: And that her pleasure therefore was, that hee shoulde declare vnto him his knowledge therein: and whether the saide <hi>Parry</hi> himselfe had let fall any speach vnto any person (though with an intent only to haue discouered his dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition) that might drawe him in suspition, as though hee himselfe had any such wicked intent. But <hi>Parry</hi> with great and vehement protestations denied it vtterly, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Master Secretarie, the rather to induce him to deale more plainely in a matter so important, declared vnto him, that there was a gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of qualitie euery way as good or better then himselfe, and rather his friend then enemie, that would auouch it to his face: yet <hi>Parry</hi> persisted stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnly in his former denial &amp; iustification of his owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie, &amp; would not in any respect yeeld that he was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or priuie to any such motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> enterprise or intent. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lodged y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> night at Master Secretaries house, the next morning he desired earnestly to haue some further speache with Master Secretarie: which graunted, <hi>Parry</hi> declared to him that he had called to remembrance that hee had once some speach with one <hi>Neuil</hi> a kinsman of his (so he called him) touching a point of doctrine conteined in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> answere made to the booke, entituled, <hi>The Execution of Iustice in England,</hi> by which booke it was resolued, that it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to take away the life of a prince, in furtherance of the Catholique religion: but he protested that they neuer had any speach at all of any attempt intended against her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties person. Which deniall of his (at two sundrie times after so much light giuen him) doeth set foorth most ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantly both the iustice and prouidence of God: His Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, for that (though hee was one of a sharpe conceipt) he had no power to take holde of this ouerture, thereby to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14412:5"/>
haue auoyded the danger that <hi>Neuils</hi> accusation might bring him into by confessing the same, as a thing propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded only to feele <hi>Neuils</hi> minde, whome before hee had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported vnto Master Secretarie he found a person discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, and therefore his confession might to very great purpose haue serued to haue cleared him selfe touching the intent: his prouidence, for that of his great mercie he would not suffer so dangerous and wicked a member to escape and to liue to her Maiesties perill.</p>
            <p>The same day at night, <hi>Parry</hi> was brought to the Earle of <hi>Leycesters</hi> house, and there eftsoones examined before the sayd Earle of <hi>Leycester,</hi> Master Uicechamberlaine, &amp; Master Secretarie: he persisted still in his deniall of all that hee was charged with. Whereupon, <hi>Neuil</hi> being brought before him face to face, iustified his accusation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him. He notwithstanding would not yet yeelde to confesse it, but very proudly and insolently opposed his credit against the credit of <hi>Neuil,</hi> affirming that his No was as good as <hi>Neuills</hi> Yea, and as by way of recrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion obiected the crime to <hi>Neuil</hi> himselfe. On the other side, <hi>Neuil</hi> did with great constancie affirme all that hee had before sayde, &amp; did set downe many probable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of the times, places, and maners of their sundrie conferences, and of such other accidents as had happened betweene them in the course of that action: whereupon <hi>Parry</hi> was then committed to the Tower, and <hi>Neuil</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by their honours, to set downe in writing vnder his hand, al that which before he had deliuered by wordes: which he did with his owne hand, as followeth.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Illiam Parry</hi> the last summer, soone after his repulse in his suite for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Mastership of <hi>S. Katherines,</hi> repaired to my lodging in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> white Fryers, where he shewed him selfe a person greatly discontented, and vehemently inueighed against her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, and willed me to assure my selfe, that during this time and state, I shoulde neuer receiue contentment. But sith, said he, I knowe you to be honourably descended, and a man of resolution, if you will giue me assurance, either to ioyne with me, or not to discouer me, I will deliuer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you the onely meanes to doe your selfe good. Which when I had promised him, he appointed me to come the next day to his house in Feuter Lane: and repairing thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accordingly, I founde him in his bed, whereupon he commaunded his men foorth, and began with me in this order. My lorde, saide he, (for so he called me) I protest before God, that three reasons principally doe induce me to enter into this action which I intende to discouer vnto you: The replanting of religion, The preferring of the Scottish Title, and The aduauncement of Iustice, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully corrupted in this Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welth. And thereupon entred into some discourses, what places were fit to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to giue entra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to such forrein forces as should be best liked of for the furtherance of such enterprises as were to be vndertaken. And with these discourses, he passed the time vntill he went to dinner: after which, the companie being retired, he entred into his former discourses. And if I be not deceiued, (said he) by taking of <hi>Quinborough Castell,</hi> we shall hinder the passage of the Queenes ships foorth of the Riuer. Whereunto when he sawe me vse no contradiction, he shooke me by the hande, Tush, saide he, this is nothing: If men were resolute, there is an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:14412:6"/>
of much more moment, and much easier to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme: An Acte honourable, and meritorious to God &amp; the world. Which seeing me desirous to knowe, he was not ashamed to vtter in plaine termes, to consist in killing of her Maiestie: wherein, saith he, if you will goe with me, I will loose my life, or deliuer my Countrey from her badde and tyrannous gouernment. At which spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches finding me discontented, he asked me if I had read <hi>Doctor Allens</hi> booke, out of which he alledged an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie for it. I answered, No, and that I did not beleeue that authoritie. Well said he, what will you say, if I shew further authoritie then this, euen from <hi>Rome</hi> it selfe, a plaine dispensation for the killing of her, wherein you shall finde it (as I said before) meritorious. Good cousin, said I, when you shall shewe it me, I shal thinke it very strange, when I shall see one to holde that for meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, which another holdeth for damnable. Well, saide <hi>Parry,</hi> doe me but the fauour to thinke vpon it till to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe: and if one man be in the towne, I will not faile to shewe you the thing it selfe: and if he be not, he will be within these v. or sixe dayes, at which time if it please you to meete me at Chanon Rowe, we may there receiue the Sacrament to bee true eche to other, and then I will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer vnto you both the partie, and the thing it selfe. Whereupon I praied <hi>Parry</hi> to thinke better vpon it, as a matter of great charge both of soule and body. I would to God, sayde <hi>Parry,</hi> you were as perfectly perswaded in it as I am, for then vndoubtedly you should doe God great seruice.</p>
                  <p>Not long after viii. or x. dayes, (as I remember) <hi>Parry</hi> comming to visit me at my lodging in <hi>Herns</hi> rents in Holborne, as he often vsed, we walked foorth into the fields, where he renewed againe his determination to kil her Maiestie, whome he saide he thought most vnworthie to liue, and that he wondred I was so scrupulous there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. She hath sought, said he, your ruine and ouerthrow,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:14412:6"/>
why shoulde you not then seeke to reuenge it? I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, quoth I, that my case is harde, but yet am I not so desperate as to reuenge it vpon my selfe, which must needes be the euent of so vnhonest and vnpossible an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise. Unpossible, said <hi>Parry,</hi> I wonder at you, for in trueth there is not any thing more easie: you are no Courtier, and therefore knowe not her customes of wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with small traine, and often in the garden very pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately, at which time my selfe may easily haue accesse vnto her, and you also when you are knowen in Courte. Upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the fact we must haue a barge ready to cary vs with speede downe the riuer, where we wil haue a shippe ready to transport vs if it be needefull: but vpon my head, wee shall neuer be followed so farre. I asked him, Howe will you escape foorth of the garden? for you shall not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to carie any men with you, and the gates will then be locked, neither can you carie a Dagge without suspition. As for a Dagge, said <hi>Parry,</hi> I care not: my Dagger is enough. And as for my escaping, those that shalbe with her, will be so busie about her, as I shall finde opportunitie enough to escape, if you be there ready with the Barge to receiue me. But if this seeme daungerous in respect of your reason before shewed, let it then rest till her comming to S. Iames, and let vs furnish our selues in the meane time with men and horse fitte for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: we may eache of vs keepe eight or ten men without suspition. And for my part, saide he, I shal finde good fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes that will followe me without suspecting mine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. It is much, said hee, that so many resolute men may doe vpon the sudaine, being well appoynted with eache his Case of Dagges: if they were an hundreth wayting vpon her, they were not able to saue her, you comming of the one side, and I on the other, and discharging our Dagges vpon her, it were vnhappie if we shoulde both misse her. But if our Dagges faile, I shall bestirre mee well with a sworde ere shee escape me. Whereunto I
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:14412:7"/>
saide, Good Doctour giue ouer this odious enterprise, and trouble me no more with the hearing of that, which in heart I lothe so much. I woulde to God the enterprise were honest, that I might make knowen vnto thee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I want resolution. And not long after, her Maiestie came to S. Iames, after which, one morning (the day cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine I remember not,) <hi>Parry</hi> reuiued againe his former discourse of killing her Maiestie, with great earnestnesse and importunity perswading me to ioyne therein: saying he thought me the onely man of Englande like to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it, in respect of my valure, as he termed it.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon, I made semblance as if I had bene more willing to heare him then before, hoping by that meanes to cause him to deliuer his minde to some other y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> might be witnes therof with me, wherein neuerthelesse I failed. After al this, on Saturday last, being the sixt of Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, betweene the houres of fiue and sixe in the after noone, <hi>Parry</hi> came to my chamber, and desired to talke with me a part, wherevpon we drew our selues to a window. And where I had tolde <hi>Parry</hi> before, that a learned man who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I met by chaunce in the fieldes, vnto whome I proponed the question touching her Maiestie, had answered mee that it was an enterprise most villanous and damnable, willing me to discharge my selfe of it: <hi>Parry</hi> then desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to knowe that learned mans name, and what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of him, saying after a scornefull manner, No doubt he was a very wise man, and you wiser in beleeuing him: and said further, I hope you tolde him not that I had any thing from Rome. Yes in trueth, saide I. Whereunto <hi>Parry</hi> saide, I would you had not named me, nor spoken of any thing I had from Rome. And thereupon hee ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly perswaded mee eftsoones to depart beyonde the seas, promising to procure me safe passage into Wales, and from thence into Britaine, whereat we ended. But I then resolued not to do so, but to discharge my conscience, and lay open this his most traiterous and abhominable

vntill Midsomer 1582. I had some trouble for the hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a Gentleman of the Temple. In which action I was so disgraced and oppressed by two great men (to whome I haue of late beene beholden) that I neuer had contented thought since. There began my misfortune, &amp; here followeth my wofull fall.</p>
                        <p>In Iulie after, I laboured for licence to trauaile for three yeeres, which (vpon some consideration) was easily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. And so in August, I went ouer with doubtfull minde of returne, for that being suspected in religion, and not hauing receiued the Communion in 22. yeeres, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to mistrust my aduauncement in England. In Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember I came to Paris, where I was reconciled to the Church, and aduised to liue without scandale, the rather for that it was mistrusted by the English Catholiques, that I had intelligence with the greatest counsellour of Englande. I stayed not long there, but remooued to Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (a place of great traffique) where, because it was the ordinarie passage of our nation to and fro betweene Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris and Rome, I was also suspected.</p>
                        <p>To put all men out of doubt of me, and for some other cause, I went to Millaine, from whence as a place of some daunger (though I founde fauour there) after I had clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red my conscience, and iustified my selfe in religion before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Inquisitour, I we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to Uenice. There I came acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with father <hi>Benedicto Palmio, a graue &amp; a learned Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite.</hi> By conference with him of the hard state of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques in England, and by reading of the Booke <hi>De persecutione Anglicana,</hi> and other discourses of like argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
                           <hi>I conceiued a possible meane to relieue the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted state of our Catholiques, if the same might be wel warranted in religion and conscience by the Pope, or some learned diuines. I asked his opinion, hee made it cleare, commended my deuotion, comforted mee in it,</hi> and after a while made me knowen to the <hi>Nuntio Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peggio,</hi> there resident for his holinesse. <hi>By his meanes I
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:14412:8"/>
wrote to the Pope, presented the seruice,</hi> and fued for a Pasport to goe to Rome, &amp; to returne safely into France. Answere came from Cardinal <hi>Como,</hi> that I might come, and should be welcome. I misliked the warrant, sued for a better, which I was promised: but it came not before my departure to Lyons, where I promised to stay some time for it. And being in deede desirous to goe to Rome, and lothe to goe without countenaunce, <hi>I desired Christofero de Salazar, Secretarie to the king Catholique in Venice, who had some vnderstanding by conference, of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion to the afflicted Catholiques at home and abroad,</hi> to commende me to the Duke <hi>di Noua terra,</hi> Gouernour of Millan, and to the Countie of <hi>Oliuaris Embi,</hi> then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident for the king his master in Rome: which he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to do effectually for the one, and did for the other. And so I toke my iourney towards Lyons, whither came for me an ample Passeport (but somewhat too late,) that I might come and goe <hi>in verbo pontificis per omnes iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiones ecclesiasticas, absque impedimento.</hi> I acquainted some good fathers there, of my necessitie to depart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes Paris by promise, <hi>and praied their aduises vpon diuers poyntes, wherein I was well satisfied.</hi> And so assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them that his holinesse shoulde heare from me short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it was vndertaken, that I shoulde bee excused for that time.</p>
                        <p>In October I came to Paris, where (vppon better opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion conceiued of mee amongst my Catholike countrie men) I founde my credit wel setled, and such as mistru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted me before, readie to trust and imbrace me. And being one day at the chamber of <hi>Thomas Morgan</hi> a Catholike Gentleman (greatly beloued and trusted on that side) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest other gentlemen, talking (but in very good sort) of Englande, I was desired by <hi>Morgan</hi> to goe vp with him to another chamber, where he brake with me, and told mee that it was hoped and looked for, that I shoulde doe some seruice for God and his Church. I answered him I
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:14412:9"/>
would do it, if it were to kill the greatest subiect in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: whome I named, and in trueth then hated. No no, said he, let him liue to his greater fal &amp; ruine of his house:</p>

I had him as I wished, and tolde him it were soone done, if it might be lawfully done, and warranted in the opinion of some learned di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines. And so the doubt once resolued (though as you haue heard I was before reasonably well satisfied) I vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to vndertake the enterprise, for the restitution of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to the auncient obedience of the Sea Apostolique.</hi> Diuers diuines were named. Doctor <hi>Alleine</hi> I desired, <hi>Persons</hi> I refused. And by chance came Maister <hi>Wattes</hi> a learned Priest, with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I conferred, and was ouerruled.</p>

                           <hi>I wrote my letters the first of Ianuarie</hi> 1584. <hi>by their computation, tooke aduise vpon them in confession of Father Aniball a Codreto a learned Iesuite in Paris, was louingly embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, commended, confessed, and communicated at the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites at one altar with the Cardinalles of Vandosmi, and Narbone, whereof I prayed certificate, and enclosed the same in my letter to his holinesse, to leade him the rather to absolue me, which I required by my letters, in conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of so great an enterprise vndertaken without

                           <hi>I went with Morgan to the Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio Ragazzoni, to whome I read the letter and certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate enclosed, sealed it, and left it with him to send to Rome: hee promised great care of it, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure answere: And so louingly imbraced me, wished mee good speede, and promised that I should be remembred at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> altar.</hi>

                           <hi>After this I desired Morgan, that some special man might be made priuie to this matter, lest hee dying, and I miscarying in the execution, and my entent neuer truely discouered, it might sticke for an euerlasting spot in my race.</hi> Diuers were named, but none agreed vpon for feare of bewraying. 7 This being done, <hi>Morgan</hi> assured me, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> shortly after my departure, <hi>the L.

I shortly departed for Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, &amp; arriued at Rie in Ianuarie 1583. from whence I wrote to the Court, aduertised some, that I had a special seruice to discouer to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Queens Maiestie, 8 <hi>which I did more to prepare accesse &amp; credit, then for any care I had of her person,</hi> though I were ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly resolued neuer to touch her (notwithstanding any war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant) if by any deuise, persuasion, or policie shee might bee wrought to deale more graciously with the Catholiques then she doeth, or by our maner of proceeding in parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t meaneth to doe, for any thing yet seene. I came to the Court, (the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at Whitehal,) praied audience, had it at large, and very priuately discouered to her Maiestie this conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie, much to this effect, <hi>though couered with all the skil I had:</hi> she tooke it doubtfully, I departed with feare. And amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst other things, I cannot forget her Maiesties graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous speech then vttered touching the Catholiques, which of late, after a sort I auowed in parliament: she said to mee
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:14412:10"/>
that neuer a Catholique should be troubled for religion or supremacie, so lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as they liued like good subiects. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I mistrusted that her Maiestie is borne in hande, that none is troubled for the one or the other. It may be truely said that it is better then it hath bene, though it be not yet as it should be.</p>
                        <p>In March last, while I was at Greenewich (as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member) suing for S. Katherines, <hi>came letters to mee from Cardinall Como, dated at Rome the last of Ianuarie before, whereby I found the enterprise commended, and allowed, and my selfe absolued (in his holines name) of all my sinnes, and willed to go forward in the name of God.</hi> That letter I shewed to some in Court, who imparted it to the Queene: what it wrought, or may worke in her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, God knoweth: only this I know, 9 y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                           <hi>it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed my resolution to kill her, and made it cleare in my consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that it was lawfull and meritorious.</hi> And yet was I determined neuer to doe it, if either pollicie, practise, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion, or motion in parliament could preuayle. I feared to be te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted, &amp; therefore alwayes when I came neere her, I left my dagger at home. 10 <hi>When I looked vpon her Maiestie, and remembred her many excellencies, I was greatly troubled: And yet I sawe no remedie, for my vowes were in heauen, my letters and promises in earth,</hi> and the case of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Catholique recusaunts, and others little bettered. Some times I said to my selfe, Why should I care for her? what hath shee done for me? haue I not spent 10000. markes since I knew her seruice, and neuer had penie by her? It may be said, she gaue me my life. But I say (as my case stoode) it had bene tyranny to take it: And I feare me it is litle lesse yet. If it please her graciously to looke into my discontentments, I would to Iesus Christ she had it, for I am weary of it. And nowe to come to an end of this tragical discourse: In Iuly I left y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Court, vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly reiected, discontented, and as her Maiestie might perceiue by my passionate letters, carelesse of my selfe.

This is the booke I shewed, in some places read, <hi>and lent to my cousin Neuil</hi> (the accuser) who came often to mine house, put his finger in my dish, his hande in my purse, and the night wherein he accused me, was wrapped in my gowne, sixe moneths at least after wee had entred into this conspiracie: In which space her Maiestie, and 10. Princes in seueral prouinces might haue bene killed. God blesse her Maiestie from him: for before Almightie God I ioy and am glad in my soule, that it was his hap <hi>to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer me in time,</hi> though there were no danger neere.</p>
                        <p>And nowe to the maner of our meetings. He came to me in the beginning of August, and spake to me in this or like sorte.

I offered to ioyne with him, and gladly heard him, <hi>hoping because I knewe him to be a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, that he woulde hit vpon that I had in my head:</hi> but it fell not out so. He thought the deliuerie of the Queene of Scotlande easie, presuming vpon his credit and kinred in the North: I thought it daungerous to her, and impossible to men of our fortunes: He fell from that to the taking of Barwicke: I spake of <hi>Quinborough</hi> and the Nauie, rather to entertaine him with discourse, then that I cared for those motions, <hi>my head being full of a greater matter:</hi> 12 I told him that I had another ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of enterprise, more honourable and profitable to vs, and the Catholiques common wealth, then all these, if he woulde ioyne in it with me, as he presently vowed to do: He pressed to knowe it, I willed him to sleepe vpon the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:14412:11"/>
motion: He did so, (and belike ouertaken) came to me the next morning to my lodging in London, offered to ioyne with me, and <hi>tooke his othe vpon a Bible, to conceale and constantly to pursue the enterprise for the aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of religion, which I also did, and meant to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme: the killing of the Queene was the matter.</hi>

If it cost him not an ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous head at last, let him neuer trust me. He brought a tall gentleman (whom he commended for an excellent Pisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier) to me to Chanon Rowe, to make one in the matche: but I refused to deale with him, being loth to laye my head vpon so many hands.</p>
                        <p>Master <hi>Neuil</hi> hath (I thinke) forgotten, that hee did sweare to me at diuers times, that all thaduancement she coulde giue, shoulde serue but for her scourge, if euer time and occasion shoulde serue: And that though hee woulde not lay hand vpon her in a corner, his hart serued him to strike off her head in the fielde. Nowe leauing him to himselfe, this much (to make an ende) I must confesse of my self, I did meane to trie what might be done in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, to doe my best to hinder all hard courses, to haue prayed hearing of the Queenes Maiestie, to moue her (if I coulde) to take compassion vpon her Catholique sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes, <hi>and when all had fayled, to doe as I entended.</hi> If her Maiestie by this course would haue eased the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, though she had neuer preferred me, I had with all comfort and

My case is rare and strange, and, for any thing I can remember, singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: a naturall subiect solemnely to vowe the death of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Queene, (so borne, so knowen, and so taken by all men) for the reliefe of the afflicted Catholiques, and restitution of religion. The matter first conceiued in Venice, the seruice, (in generall wordes) presented to the Pope, continued and vndertaken in Paris, and lastly commended, and warranted by his holinesse, digested &amp; resolued in England, if it had not bene preuented by accusation, or by her Maiesties greater lenitie and more gracious vsage of her Catholique subiectes. This is my first and last offence conceiued against my Prince or Countrey, and doeth (I cannot denie) conteyne all other faults whatsoeuer. It is nowe to be punished by death, or most graciously (beyonde all common expectation) to be pardoned. Death I doe confesse to haue deserued: life I doe (with all humilitie) craue, if it may stand with the Queenes honour, and policie of the time. To leaue so great a treason vnpuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, were strange: To drawe it by my death in example, were dangerous: A sworne serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to take vpon him such an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise vpon such a ground, and by such a warrant, hath not bin seene in England: To indict him, arraigne him, bring him to the Scaffolde, and to publish his offence, can doe no good: To hope that he hath more to discouer then is confessed, or that at his execution he will vnsay any thing he hath written, is in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:14412:13"/>
vaine: To conclude, that it is impossible for him in time to make some part of ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, were very hard, &amp; against former experiences. The question then is, whether it be better to kill him, or (least the matter be mistake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) vpon hope of his amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to pardon him. For mine own opinion (though partial) I will deliuer you my conscience. The case is good Queene Elizabeths, the offence is committed against her sacred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and she may (of her mercie) pardon it without preiudice to any. Then this I say, in fewe wordes, as a man more desirous to discharge his troubled conscience, then to liue. Pardon poore <hi>Parry,</hi> and relieue him: for life without liuing is not fit for him. If this may not be, or be thought dangerous, or dishonourable to the Queenes Maiestie (as by your fauours, I thinke it full of honour and mercie) then I beseeche your Lordships (and no other) once to heare me before I be indic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and afterwards (if I must dye) humbly to intreate the Queenes Maiestie to hasten my tryall and execution, which I pray God (with all my heart) may prooue as honourable to her, as I hope it shall be happie to me, who will, while I liue, (as I haue done alwayes) pray to Iesus Christ for her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties long and prosperous reigne.

I answered, that the Scripture aunswereth thereto, saying, <hi>Non sunt facienda mala, vt veniant bona.</hi> So that for no good, howe great that euer it be, may be wrought any euill, howe little that euer it be. Hee replyed that it was not euill to take away so great euil, and induce so great good.

               <head>The maner of the Arraignement of <hi>William Parry</hi> the xxv. of Februarie, 1584. at Westminster, in the place where the courte commonly called the Kings Bench, is vsually kept by vertue of her Maiesties Commission of Oyer &amp; Terminer, before <hi>Henrie L.

of the deuill, and intending to withdrawe and extinguish the heartie loue and due obedience, which true and faithfull Subiectes shoulde beare vnto the same our Soueraigne Ladie, diddest at Westminster in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Middlesex on the first day of Februarie, in the xxvi. yeere of her Highnesse raigne, and at diuers other times and places in the same Countie, maliciously, and trayte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously conspire and compasse, not onely to depriue and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the same our Soueraigne Ladie of her Royall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, title and dignitie, but also to bring her highnesse to death and finall destruction, and sedition in the Realme to make, and the gouernement thereof to subuert, and the sincere religion of God established in her highnesse domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions to alter &amp; subuert. And that, whereas thou <hi>William Parry,</hi> by thy letters sent vnto <hi>Gregorie</hi> Bishoppe of Rome, diddest signifie vnto the same Bishoppe thy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses and intentions aforesayde, and thereby diddest pray and require the same Bishoppe to giue thee absolution, that thou afterwards, that is to say, the last day of March in the xxvi. yeere aforesayde, diddest trayterously receiue letters fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one called <hi>Cardinall de Como,</hi> directed vnto thee <hi>William Parry,</hi> whereby the same Cardinall did signifie vnto thee, that the Bishoppe of Rome had perused thy letters, and allowed of thine intent, and that to that ende hee had absolued thee of all thy sinnes, and by the same letter did animate and stirre thee to proceede with thine enterprise, and that therupon, thou, the last day of August in the xxvi. yeere aforesaide, at Saint Giles in the fieldes, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same Countie of Middlesex, diddest trayterously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre with one <hi>Edmunde Neuill</hi> Esquire, vttering to him all thy wicked and trayterous deuises, and then and there diddest moue him to assist thee therin, &amp; to ioyne with thee in those wicked treasons aforesayd, against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peace of our sayd Soueraigne Ladie the Queene, her Crowne &amp; dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: What sayest thou <hi>William Parry,</hi> art thou guilty of these treasons whereof thou standest here indicted, or not

God saue Queene Elizabeth, and God sende mee grace to discharge my duetie to her, and to send you home in charitie. But touching the matters that I am indicted of, some were in one place, and some in another, and done so secretely, as none can see into them, except y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they had eyes like vnto God, wherefore I will not lay my blood vpon the Iurie, but doe minde to confesse the indictment. It containeth but the parts that haue bene openly redde, I pray you tel me? Whereunto it was answered, that the Indictment conteined the partes he had heard redde, and no other: whereupon the Clarke of the Crowne saide vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Parry, Parry,</hi> thou must answere directly to the indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whether thou be guiltie or not.</p>
               <p>Then sayde <hi>Parry,</hi>

                  </note> I doe confesse that I am guiltie of al that is therein co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained: And further too, I desire not life, but desire to die. Unto which the clarke of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Crowne sayd, If you confesse it, you must confesse it in maner and fourme as it is comprised in the Iudictment. Whereunto he sayd, I doe confesse it in maner and fourme as the same is set downe, and all the circumstances thereof. Then the confession being recorded, the Queenes learned counsel being readie to pray iudgement vpon the same confession, Master Vicechamberlaine sayde, These matters contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this indictment, and confessed by this man, are of great importance: they touch the person of the Queenes most excellent Maiestie in the highest degree, the very state and weldoing of the whole common wealth, and the trueth of Gods worde established in these her Maiesties dominions, and the open demonstration of that capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall enuie of the man of Rome, that hath set him selfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God and all godlinesse, all good Princes and good gouernment, and against good men. Wherefore, I pray
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:14412:17"/>
you, for the satisfaction of this great multitude, let the whole matter appeare, that euery one may see that the matter of it selfe is as bad as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> indictment purporteth, &amp; as he hath confessed. Wherto in respect y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Iustice of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Realme hath bin of late very impude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly slau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dered, al yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as a thing necessarie to satisfie the world in particular, of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which was but summarily comprised in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> indictme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, though in the lawe, his confession serued sufficiently to haue proceeded thereupon vnto iudgement. Whereupon the Lordes and others the Commissioners, her Maiesties learned Counsel, and <hi>Parry</hi> him self agreed, that <hi>Parrys</hi> confession (taken the xi. and xiii. of Februarie 1584. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord of <hi>Hunsdon,</hi> master Vicechamberlaine, and master Secretarie,) and Cardinall <hi>de Como</hi> his letters, and <hi>Parrys</hi> letters to the Lorde Treasourer and Lorde Stewarde, should be openly read.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Parry,</hi> for the better satisfying of the people and standers by, offered to reade them him selfe: but being tolde that the order was, the Clerke of the Crowne should reade them, it was so resolued of all partes. And then master Vicechamberlaine caused to be shewed to <hi>Parry</hi> his sayde confession, the Cardinals letter, and his owne letter aforesayde, which after hee had particularly viewed euery leafe thereof, he confessed, and sayde openly they were the same.</p>
               <p>Then sayde master Vicechamberlaine, Before we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede to shewe what he hath confessed, what say you, sayd he to <hi>Parry,</hi> is that which you haue confessed here true, and did you confesse it freely and willingly of your selfe, or was then any extort meanes vsed to drawe it from you?</p>
               <p>Surely sayde <hi>Parry,</hi> I made that confession freely without any constraint, and that is all true, and more too: for there is no treason that hath bene sithens the first yeere of the Queene any way touching religion, sauing receipt of <hi>Agnus dei,</hi> and perswading of others, wherein I haue
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:14412:17"/>
not much dealt, but I haue offended in it. And I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so deliuered mine opinion in writing, who ought to bee successor to the crowne, which he sayde to be treason also.</p>
               <p>Then his confession of the eleuenth and thirteenth of Februarie,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Parrys confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons was red by his owne assent.</hi>
                  </note> all of his owne hand writing, &amp; before parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly sette downe, was openly, and distinctly red by the Clarke of the crowne. And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> done, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cardinall <hi>di Como</hi> his letter in Italian was deliuered vnto <hi>Parrys</hi> hande, by the direction of Master Vicechamberlayne, which <hi>Parry</hi> there perused,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>A letter of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall di Como to Parry, also red.</hi>
                  </note> and openly affirmed to bee wholy of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals owne hand writing, and the seale to bee his owne also, and to bee with a Cardinals hat on it: And himselfe did openly read it in Italian, as before is set downe. And the wordes bearing sence as it were written to a Bishop or to a man of such degree, it was demaunded of him by Master Vicechamberlayne, whether he had not taken the degree of a Bishoppe? He said, No: But said at first, those termes were proper to the degree hee had taken: and after saide that the Cardinall did vouchsafe as of a fauour to write so to him. Then the coppie of that letter in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish as before is also set downe, was in like maner openly red by the Clarke of the Crowne, which <hi>Parry</hi> then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be truely translated.</p>
               <p>And thereupon was shewed vnto <hi>Parry</hi> his letter of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> xviii. of Februarie,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Parrys letter of the</hi> 18. <hi>of Febru. to the L. Treaso. and the Earle of Leycester red.</hi>
                  </note> written to the Lord Treasorer, and the Lord Steward: which he confessed to bee all of his owne hand writing and was as before is set downe.</p>
               <p>These matters being redde openly for manifestation of the matter, <hi>Parry</hi> prayed leaue to speake: whereto Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Vicechamberlayne sayde, If you will say any thing for the better opening to the worlde of those your foule &amp; horrible facts, speake on: but if you meane to make any excuse of that which you haue confessed, which els would haue bene and do stand proued against you, for my part, I will not sit to heare you.</p>
               <p>Then her Maiesties Attourney general stood vp &amp; said,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:14412:18"/>
It appeareth before you my Lords, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this man hath bene indicted &amp; arraigned of seuerall most haynous and horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble treasons, and hath confessed them, which is before you of recorde: wherefore there resteth no more to be done, but for the Court to giue iudgement accordingly,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Queenes Attourney re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                  </note> which here I require in the behalfe of the Queenes Maiestie.</p>
               <p>Then said <hi>Parry,</hi> I pray you heare me for discharging of my conscience. I will not goe about to excuse my selfe, nor to seeke to saue my life, I care not for it, you haue my confession of recorde, that is enough for my life: And I meane to vtter more, for which I were worthie to die. And sayde, I pray you heere mee, in that I am to speake to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge my conscience.</p>
               <p>Then said Master Vicechamberlayne, <hi>Parry,</hi> then doe thy duetie according to conscience, and vtter all that thou canst say concerning those thy most wicked facts.</p>
               <p>Then said <hi>Parry,</hi> My cause is rare, singular &amp; vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, conceyued at <hi>Venice,</hi> presented in generall wordes to the Pope, vndertaken at <hi>Paris,</hi> commended &amp; allowed of by his Holines, and was to haue bene executed in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, if it had not bene preuented. Yea, I haue committed many treasons, for I haue committed treason in being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, and treason in taking absolution.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Parry had for his credit afore time said very se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, that he had bene solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted beyond the seas to commit the fact, but he would not do it, wherewith he craftily abused both y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Queenes Maiesty, &amp; those two Counsellers whereof he now woulde helpe himselfe with these false spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches against most manifest proofes.</hi>
                  </note> There hath bene no Treason sithens the first yeere of the Queenes reigne touching religion, but that I am guiltie of (except for receiuing of <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> and perswading as I haue said:) And yet neuer intended to kil Queene <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> I appeale to her owne knowledge and to my Lorde Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorers and Master Secretaries.</p>
               <p>Then said my Lord <hi>Hunsdon,</hi> Hast thou acknowledged it so often, and so plainly in writing vnder thy hande, and heere of recorde: and nowe, when thou shouldest haue thy iudgement according to that which thou hast confessed thy selfe guiltie of, doest thou goe backe againe, and deny the effect of all? Howe can wee beleeue that thou nowe fayest?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:14412:18"/>Then said Master Vicechamberlaine,<note place="margin">

                  </note> This is absued. Thou hast not onely confessed generally, that thou wert guilty according to the indiceme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which summarily, and yet in expresse woordes doeth conteyne that thou haddest trayterously compassed &amp; intended the death and destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her Maiestie: but thou also saydest particularly that thou wert guilty of euery of the Treasons conteined therein, whereof the same was one in playne and expresse letter set downe, and red vnto thee. Yea, thou saydest that thou were guilty of moe Treasons too besides these. And diddest thou not vpon thy examination voluntaryly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, howe thou wast moued first thereunto by mislike of thy state after thy departure out of the Realme, And that thou diddest mislike her Maiestie for that shee had done nothing for thee, Howe by wicked Papistes and Popish bookes, thou wert perswaded that it was lawfull to kill her Maiestie, Howe thou wert by reconciliation become one of that wicked sort, that helde her Maiestie for ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lawfull Queene, nor Christian, And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious to kill her? And diddest thou not signifie that thy purpose to the Pope by letters, and receiuedst letters fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Cardinall, howe he allowed of thyne intent, &amp; excited thee to perfourme it, and thereupon diddest receiue abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution? And diddest thou not conceyue it, promise it, vow it, sweare it, and receyue the Sacrament that thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest doe it? And diddest not thou thereupon affirme, that thy vowes were in heauen, and thy letters and promyses on earth to bynde thee to doe it? And that whatsoeuer her Maiestie would haue done for thee, coulde not haue remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thee from that intention or purpose, vnlesse she would haue desisted from dealing as shee hath done with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques, as thou callest them? All this thou hast plainely confessed: and I protest before this great assembly, thou hast confessed it more playnely and in better sort, then my memory will serue me to vtter: And sayest thou now, that thou neuer mentest it?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:14412:19"/>Ah sayde <hi>Parry,</hi> your honours knowe, howe my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession vpon myne examination was extorted.</p>
               <p>Then both the Lord <hi>Hunsdon</hi> and Master Vicecham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlayne affirmed, that there was no torture or threatning wordes offered him.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Parry</hi> then sayde, that they tolde him, that if hee would not confesse willingly, he should haue torture: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto their honours answered, that they vsed not any spech or worde of torture to him.</p>
               <p>You sayde, sayd <hi>Parry,</hi> that you would proceede with rigour against me, if I would not confesse it of my selfe.</p>
               <p>But their honours expresly affirmed, that they vsed no such words. But I will tell thee, sayd Master Vicecham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlayne, what we saide. I spake these words, If you will willingly vtter the truth of your selfe, it may do you good, and I wish you to doe so: If you will not, wee must then proceede in ordinary course to take your examination. Whereunto you answered, that you would tell the trueth of your selfe.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Parry reproued of false spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and so by himselfe also confessed.</hi>
                  </note> Was not this true? which then hee yeelded vnto.</p>
               <p>And hereunto, her Maiesties Attourney generall put <hi>Parry</hi> in remembraunce what speeches hee vsed to the Lieutenant of the Tower, the Queenes Maiesties Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iant at Lawe, Master <hi>Gaudie,</hi> and the same Attourney on Satterday y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> twentieth of February last, at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Tower, vpon that hee was by them then examined by order from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lords: which was, that he acknowledged he was most myldely and fauourably dealt with, in all his examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which he also at the Barre then acknowledged to be true.</p>
               <p>Then Master Vicechamberlayne sayde, that it was wonder to see the magnanymitie of her Maiestie, which after that thou haddest opened those trayterous practises in sort as thou hast layd it downe in thy confession, was neuerthelesse such, and so farre from all feare, as that shee woulde not so much as acquaint any one of her highnes

priuie Counsel with it, to his knowledge, no not vntil af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this thine enterprise discouered &amp; made manifest. And besides that which thou hast set downe vnder thine owne hande, thou diddest confesse, that thou haddest prepared two Scottish Daggers, fit for such a purpose: and those being disposed away by thee, thou diddest say that an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would serue thy turne.

And that therewith, and vpon some speeches vsed by her Maiestie, thou diddest turne about and weepe bitterly to thy selfe? And yet diddest call to mynde that thy vowes were in heauen, thy letters and promises on earth, and that therefore thou diddest say with thy selfe, that there was no remedy but to do it? diddest thou not confesse this? the which he acknowledged.</p>
               <p>Then saide the lorde <hi>Hunsdon,</hi>

                  </note> Sayest thou nowe, that thou diddest neuer meane to kill the Queene? diddest thou not confesse, that when thou diddest vtter this practise of trecherie to her Maiestie, that thou diddest couer it with al the skill thou haddest, and that it was done by thee, rather to get credite and accesse thereby, then for any regard thou haddest of her person? but in trueth thou diddest it, that thereby thou mightest haue better oportunitie to performe thy wicked enterprise. And wouldest thou haue runne into such feare as thou diddest confesse that thou wert in, when thou diddest vtter it, if thou haddest neuer meant it? what reason canst thou shewe for thy selfe? With that he cryed out in a furious maner, I neuer meant to kill her: I will lay my blood vpon Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and you, before God and the worlde: and thereupon fell into a rage and euill wordes with the Queenes Maiesties Attourney generall.</p>
               <p>Then said the lord <hi>Hunsdon,</hi> This is but thy popish pride

and ostentation, which thou wouldest haue to be told to thy fellowes of that faction, to make them belieue that thou diest for poperie, when thou diest for most horrible and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous treasons against her Maiestie, and thy whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. For thy laying of thy blood, it must lye on thine owne head, as a iust reward of thy wickednesse. The lawes of the Realme most iustly condemne thee to die out of thine owne mouth for the conspiring the destruction both of her Maiestie, and of vs all: therefore thy blood be vpon thee, neither her Maiestie, nor we at any time sought it, thy selfe hast spilt it.</p>
               <p>Then he was asked what he coulde say, why iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of death ought not to be awarded against him.</p>

               <p>Then said the lord chiefe Iustice, <hi>Parry,</hi> thou hast bene before this time indited of diuers most horrible and hatefull treasons, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted against thy most gratious Soueraigne, and natiue countrey: the matter most detestable, the maner most subtile and dangerous, and the occasions and meanes that led thee thereunto, most vngodly and villanous. That thou diddest intende it, it is most euident by thy selfe. The matter was the destruction of a most sacred and an anoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Queene thy soueraigne &amp; mystresse, who hath shewed thee such fauour, as some thy betters haue not obteined: yea, the ouerthrowe of thy countrey wherein thou wert borne, and of a most happie common wealth whereof thou art a member, and of such a Queene, as hath bestowed on thee the benefite of all benefites in this worlde, that is, thy life, heretofore graunted thee by her mercie when thou had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest lost it by Iustice and desert. Yet thou her seruant, sworne to defende her, mentest with thy bloodie hande to haue taken away her life, that mercifully gaue thee thine when it was yeelded into her handes. This is the matter wherein thou hast offended. The maner was most subtile and dangerous beyonde all that before thee haue commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any wickednes against her Maiestie: For thou making shewe as if thou wouldest simplie haue vttered for her safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie the euill that others had contriued, diddest but seeke thereby credite &amp; accesse, that thou mightest take the apter opportunitie for her destruction. And for the occasions and meanes that drewe thee on, they were most vngodly and villanous, As the perswasions of the Pope, of Papists and Popish bookes. The Pope pretendeth that hee is a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stour, when as in trueth hee is farre from feeding of the flocke of Christ, but rather as a woolfe seeketh but to feede on and to sucke out the blood of true Christians, and as it were thirsteth after the blood of our most gracious and Christian Queene. And these Papists and Popish bookes, while they pretende to set foorth diuinitie, they doe in deede
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:14412:21"/>
most vngodly teach and perswade that which is quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie both to God and his worde. For the word teacheth obedience of subiectes towardes Princes, and forbiddeth any priuate man to kill: but they teache subiectes to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey Princes, and that a priuate wicked person may kill. Yea, and whom? a most godly Queene, and their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and most gracious soueraigne. Let all men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take heede how they receiue any thing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, heare or reade any of their bookes, and howe they conferre with any Papists. God graunt her Maiestie, that she may know by thee, howe euer shee trust such like to come so neere her person. But see the ende, and why thou diddest it, and it will appeare to bee a most miserable, fearefull and foolish thing: For thou diddest imagine, that it was to relieue those that thou callest Catholiques, who were most likely amongst all others to haue felt the worst of it, if thy deuilish practise had taken effect. But sith thou hast bene indited of the treasons comprised in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inditement, and thereupon ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned, and hast confessed thy selfe guiltie of them, the Court doth award,<note place="margin">

               <p>This vile and trayterous wretch was one of the yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger sonnes of a poore man, called <hi>Harry ap Dauid:</hi> hee dwelled in Northwales in a litle village called <hi>Northoppe,</hi> in the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty of Flint: there he kept a common ale house, which was the best and greatest stay of his liuing. In that house was this Traytour borne, his mother was the reputed daughter of one <hi>Conway</hi> a Priest, Parson of a poore Parish called <hi>Halkyn</hi> in the same countie of Flint: his eldest brother dwelleth at this present in the same house, and there keepeth an ale house as his father did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. This traytour in his childehood so soone as hee had learned a litle to write and read, was put to serue a poore man dwelling in <hi>Chester,</hi> named <hi>Iohn Fisher,</hi> who professed to haue some small skill &amp; vnderstanding in the law. With him he continued diuers yeres, and serued as a Clerke, to write such things, as in that trade which his mastervsed, he was appoynted. During this time, he lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the English tongue, and at such times of leasure, as the poore man his master had no occasion otherwise to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:14412:22"/>
vse him, he was suffered to goe to the grammer Schole, where he got some litle vnderstanding in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Latin tongue. In this his childhood, he was noted by such as best knew him, to be of a most villanous &amp; dangerous nature and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. He did often runne away from his master, and was often taken &amp; brought to him againe. His master, to correct his peruerse and frowarde conditions, did many times shut him as prysoner in some close place of his house, &amp; many times caused him to be chayned, locked, &amp; clogged, to stay his running away. Yet all was in vayne: for about the thirde yeere of her Maiesties raigne, for his last farewel to his poore master: he ranne away from him, and came to London to seeke his aduentures. Hee was then constrayned to seeke what trade he coulde to liue by, and to get meate and drinke for his bellie, and clothes for his backe. His good happe in the ende was to be entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in place of seruice aboue his desert, where hee stayed not long, but shifted himselfe diuers times from seruice to seruice, and from one master to another. Nowe he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to forget his olde home, his birth, his education, his parents, his friendes, his owne name, and what he was. He aspired to greater matters, he challenged the name &amp; title of a great gentleman, he vanted himselfe to be of kin and alied to noble and worshipfull, hee left his olde name which he did beare, &amp; was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly called by in his child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and during all the time of his aboad in the countrey, which was <hi>William ap Harry</hi> (as the maner in Wales is.) And because he would seeme to be in deede the man which he pretended, hee tooke vpon him the name of <hi>Parry,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the syrname of diuers gentlemen of great worship, and hauiour. And because his mothers name by her father a simple priest, was <hi>Conway:</hi> He pretended kinred to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie of <hi>Sir Iohn Conway,</hi> &amp; so therby made himselfe of kin to <hi>Edmund Neuil.</hi> Being thus set forth with his new name and newe title of gentleman, and commended by some of his good fauourers, he matched himselfe in mariage with
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:14412:23"/>
a widowe in Southwales, who brought him some reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable portion of wealth. She liued with him but a short time, and the wealth he had with her lasted not long: it was soone consumed with his dissolute and wastfull maner of life. He was then driuen to his wonted shifts, his creditors were many, the debt which he owed, great, he had nothing wherewith to make payment, he was continually pursued by Serieants and Officers to arrest him, he did often by sleightes and shiftes escape from them. In this his needy and poore estate, he sought to repaire himselfe againe by a newe match in mariage with another widowe, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was the wife of one <hi>Richard Heywood.</hi> This matter was so earnestly followed by himselfe, and so effectually commended by his friends and fauourers, that the sisly wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man yeelded to take him to husband: a match in euery re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect very vnequall and vnfit: her wealth and yeerely liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood was very great, his poore and base estate worse then nothing, he very yong, she of such age, as for yeeres she might haue bene his mother. When hee had thus pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed himselfe of his newe wiues wealth, he omitted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that might serue for a prodigall, dissolute, and most vngodly course of life. His ryot and excesse was vnmeasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, hee did most wickedly defloure his wiues owne daughter, and sundry wayes pitifully abuse the olde mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: He caried himselfe for his outwarde port and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance (so long as his olde wiues bagges lasted) in such sort, as might well haue suffised for a man of very good hauiour and degree. But this lasted not long, his proude heart and wastfull hande had soone powred out olde <hi>Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woods</hi> wealth. He then fell againe to his wonted shiftes, borowed where he could finde any to lend, and ingaged his credit so farre as any would trust him. Amongst others, he became greatly indebted to <hi>Hugh Hare,</hi> the gentleman before named. Who after long forbearing of his money, sought to recouer it by ordinarie meanes of Lawe. For this cause <hi>Parry</hi> conceiued great displeasure against him,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:14412:23"/>
which hee pursued with all malice, euen to the seeking of his life. In this murtherous intent, hee came in the night time to <hi>M. Hares</hi> chamber in the Temple, broke open the doore, assaulted him, and wounded him grieuously, and so left him in great danger of life. For this offence he was apprehended, committed to Newgate, indicted of burgu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larie, arraigned, and founde guiltie by a very substanciall Iurie,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Party condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for burgula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, pardoned of the Queene.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>and condemned to be hanged, as the Law in that case requireth.</hi> He standing thus conuicted, her Maiestie of her most gracious clemencie, and pitifull disposition, tooke compassion vpon him, pardoned his offence, and gaue him his life, which by the Lawe and due course of Iustice hee ought then to haue lost. After this hee taried not long, but pretending some causes of discontentment, departed the Realme, and traueiled beyonde the seas. Howe hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaned himselfe there from time to time, and with whom he conuersed, is partly in his owne confession touched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. This is the man, this is his race, which hee feared should be spotted if he miscaried in thexecution of his trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous enterprise, this hath bene the course of his life, these are the great causes of his discontentment.</p>
               <p>And whereas at his arraignement and execution, hee pretended great care of the disobedient popish subiectes of this Realme, whom he called Catholiques, and in very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent sort seemed to glory greatly in the profession of his pretensed Catholique religion: The whole course and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his life sheweth plainely, how prophanely and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiously he did alwayes beare himselfe. He vaunted, that for these two and twentie yeeres past he had bene a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, and during all that time neuer receiued the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: yet before he traueyled beyond the Seas, at three seuerall times within the compasse of those two and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeeres, he did voluntarily take the othe of obedience to the Queenes Maiestie, set downe in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> statute made in the first yere of her highnesse reigne, by which, amongst other things, he did testifie and declare in his conscience, that no
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:14412:24"/>
forraigne prince, person, prelate, state, or potentate, hath or ought to haue any iurisdiction, power, preeminence, or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, Ecclesiastical or Spiritual, within this Realme, and therefore did vtterly renounce and forsake all foraine iurisdictions, powers, and authorities, and did promise to beare faith and true allegiance to the Queenes high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, her heires and lawfull successours.</p>
               <p>With what conscience or religion, he tooke that othe so often, if he were then a Papist in deede, as sithence the discouerie of his treasons he pretended, let his best friends the Papists themselues iudge. But perhaps it may be saide, that he repented those his offences past: that since those three othes so taken by him, he was twise reconciled to the Pope, and so his conscience cleared, and he become a newe man, and (which is more) that in the time of his last trauel, he cast away all his former lewde maners: that he changed his degree and habite, and bought or begged the graue title of a Doctor of lawe, for which hee was well qualified with a litle grammer schoole latine: that he had plenary indulgence, and remission of all his sinnes, in consideration of his vndertaking of so holy an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise as to kill Queene Elizabeth, a sacred anoynted Queene, his natural and Soueraigne Ladie: that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to the Pope, and vowed to God to perfourme it: that he confirmed the same by receiuing the Sacrament at the Iesuites, at one Altar with his two beaupeeres, the Cardinalles of <hi>Vandosme</hi> and <hi>Narbone</hi>: and that since his last returne into England, he did take his othe vpon the Bible to execute it. These reasons may seeme to beare some weight in deede amongst his friendes the Iesuites, and other Papistes of state, who haue speciall skill in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of such importance.</p>
               <p>But nowe lately in the beginning of this Parliament in Nouember last, hee did eftsones solemnely in publique place take the othe before mentioned, of obedience to her Maiestie. Howe that may stande with his reconciliations
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:14412:24"/>
to the Pope, and with his promises, vowes, and othe to kill the Queene, it is a thing can hardly bee warranted, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it bee by some speciall priuiledge of the Popes omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie.</p>
               <p>But let him haue the glorie hee desired, to liue and die a Papist. Hee deserued it, it is fit for him, his death was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondent to the course of his life, which was disloyall, periured, and traiterous towardes her Maiestie, and false and perfidious towardes the Pope himselfe, and his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques, if they will beleeue his solemne protestations which he made at his arraignement and execution, that he neuer ment nor intended any hurt to her Highnes person. For if that be true, where are then his vowes which he said were in heauen, his letters &amp; promises vpon earth? Why hath he stollen out of the Popes shoppe so large an Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and plenarie remission of all his sinnes, and meant to perfourme nothing that hee promised? Why was his deuotion and zeale so highly commended? Why was hee so specially prayed for and remembred at the Altar? All these great fauours were then bestowed vpon him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cause or desert: for hee deceiued the Pope, he deceiued the Cardinals, and Iesuites, with a false semblance, and pretence to do that thing which he neuer meant.</p>
               <p>But the matter is cleare, the conspiracie, and his traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous intent is too plaine and euident: it is the Lorde that reuealed it in time, and preuented their malice: there lacked no wil, or readinesse in him to execute that horrible fact. It is the Lorde that hath preserued her Maiestie from all the wicked practises and conspiracies of that hellish rable: it is hee that hath most graciously deliuered her from the hands of this traiterous miscre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant. The Lord is her onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in whome shee hath alwayes trusted.</p>

I knowe not howe he may be excused, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out strong suspition of the excuser. And yf a Prince may not iudge a wicked seruant out of his owne mouth, nor determine an offence by two or three mouthes, it were a notable world for Traitors and murderers, thus to haue all proceedings set loose, as well of our common Lawes, which condemne vpon all euidences, as of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ciuill lawes, which giue capitall sentence vpon confession onely: yea, Moses wisedome is ouerreached, and Christes equitie in his Euangelicall parable against the lewde seruant not vsing his talent is eluded.
