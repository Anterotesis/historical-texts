         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

neede in many words to shew the excellent vse of this prophecie of <hi>Daniel,</hi>
nor what I haue performed in it: the generall Questions set before the
Booke, shall satisfie the Reader in the one, and the worke it selfe shall speake

obseruation, out of writers both old and new, both Protestants and others:
that the Reader may in few houres finde that, which I was many weekes in

is extended generally to the Church of God in all ages, but more speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
it concerned the state and condition of the Iewes then beeing in
captiuitie: wherein to their comfort three things specially are declared
and foretold. 1. The diuerse changes and accidents, calamities and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
which should befall the people of God, vnder the kingdomes of
the Chaldeans, Persians, and Grecians; First, vnder Alexander the great, then vnder his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,
which diuided his Empire among them. 2. The comming of the Messiah is pointed
out, the time when, and ende wherefore he should come. 3. with such innouations as
should followe, as the ceasing of the ceremonies, and the abdication of the Iewes: <hi>Iun.</hi> And
all to this ende, that the people of God might be prepared, not to expect any terrene hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse

                     <p>The parts of the booke are these: It is partly historicall, partly propheticall.</p>
                     <p>1. The historicall part, is either concerning certaine kings, or Daniel, and his godly
companions: and these things are handled ioyntly together. The Kings whose historie is set
downe, were <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> in the 4. first chap. <hi>Balthazar</hi> in the 5. <hi>Darius</hi> in the 6.
The historie of Daniel is continued in all these chapters, onely the third excepted: and of
his godly companions, in the 1. and 3. <hi>Polan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And in this first part 3. speciall vertues of Daniel are described. 1. His sobrietie and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence,
cap. 1. 2. His wisedome and diuine vnderstanding in the opening and reuealing
of dreames and hid mysteries, c. 2. c. 4. c. 5. And 3. his pietie toward God, c. 6. So he is
commended <hi>propter sobrietatem, sapientiam, pietatem:</hi> for his <hi>sobrietie, prudencie, pietie.

                     <p>And by these diuine testimonies God gaue witnesse vnto Daniel, that the mysticall
prophesies following might be receiued with greater authoritie.</p>
                     <p>2. In the second part: the propheticall predictions, either concerne the enemies of Gods
Church, as of the iudgements of God vpon <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> c. 4. and <hi>Balthazar,</hi> c. 5. or
they belong vnto the Church, either shewing their afflictions and calamities. c. 10. 11. or

perfected and consummate in the next in the resurrection. c. 12. <hi>Polan.</hi>

in this Booke.</head>
                     <p>The originall text in this booke is partly written in the Hebrewe language, partly in the
Chalde: from the beginning of the 1. Chap. to the 4. ver. of the second, and the fiue last
chapters are all written in the Hebrewe tongue. And from the 4. v. of the second chap. to
the ende of the 7. chap. the historie is penned in the Chalde dialect. <hi>Polan.</hi> The reasons
whereof, are yeelded to be these. 1. For the credit of this historie, the Lord bringeth forth
forreine nations, <hi>annalesque eorum testes,</hi> and their Chronicles as witnesses, least any should
doubt of the truth thereof. <hi>Iun.</hi> 2. An other reason is, because God would haue some part
of this historie come to the knoweledge of the heathen, as it was requisite, that the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
should knowe the sinnes and impieties of that nation, and the iudgements which should
befall them, <hi>ad testandam omnibus Dei veritatem, &amp;c.</hi> to testifie vnto all the truth of God:
therefore in generall the alteration of the terrene states and kingdomes, and the power of
Christs kingdome are shadowed forth. c. 1. and c. 7. and published in the Chalde language,
that the Gentiles might take knowledge thereof, but the particular histories of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of the Messiah, of his office, kingdome, and of the calamities and afflictions which
should befall the people of God, are set forth in the Hebrewe tongue, in the fiue last chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
as most specially concerning them, <hi>Iun.</hi> in cap. 7. 3. A third reason is, that the histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of Daniels acts, set forth in the 6. first chapters, beeing expressed in the Chalde speach,
might giue testimonie vnto Daniel, that the Iewes might receiue him for a Prophet of God.

historie it pleased God, that the historie of such things, as were said and done in Chaldes,
should be written in the same language, wherein they were first spoken: like as in Ezra the
epistles and rescripts of the kings, are deliuered in the Chalde speach, as taken out of their
publike acts and records. <hi>Iun. in proleg.</hi>

                     <p>Beside the originall text thus consisting partly of the Hebrewe, partly of the Chalde

of <hi>Aquila, Symmachus, Theodotion.</hi> But <hi>Hierome</hi> sheweth that the translation of the
Septuagint, whatsoeuer was the cause thereof, whether they did not expresse the Chalde
phrase,<note place="margin">Hieron. proleg. in Daniel.</note> or some one ignorant of the Chalde tongue did set it forth vnder their name, <hi>multum
discordat à veritate,</hi> doth dissent much from the truth, <hi>&amp; recto iudicio repudiatus est, &amp;c.</hi>
and therefore was vpon a right iudgement reiected of the Church: And therefore in the
stead thereof the translation of <hi>Theodotion</hi> was receiued of the Church: as the same <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>
sheweth,<note place="margin">Lib. 2 contr. Ruffin.</note> which notwithstanding is in many places erroneous, as shall appeare in the

                        <p>1. Wicked <hi>Porphirie</hi> in the 12. booke of those which he wrote against the Christians,
contendeth that this prophesie was not written by Daniel, but by some that liued in the time
of Antiochus Epiphanes, or after when all these things here prophesied of were fulfilled:
but his cauillous obiections were long since refuted by Apollinaris, Methodius, Eusebius:
and the falshood thereof is conuinced by this, that the Septuagint, who liued almost an
100. yeares before that Antiochus, did translate this booke into Greeke: and Iosephus in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:18834:5"/>
his 11. booke <hi>Antiquitat. Iuda.</hi> reporteth how Iaddus the high Priest shewed vnto Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

that this booke of Daniel, of Ezekiel, and of the 12. Prophets, were written by the

written by the Prophet Daniel, who was so famous among the Kings of Chaldea, and of
Persia, beside the title of the booke, which is called in the Hebrewe <hi>sepher Daniel,</hi> the

                        <p>1. The name <hi>Daniel</hi> signifieth the iudgements of God, or God is my iudge, which
name was giuen him by the singular prouidence of God, for both <hi>per eum annntiata sunt
iudicia Dei,</hi> by him the iudgements of God were denounced and declared, and God was
present with him, as his defender and iudge against his aduersaries. <hi>Bullin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Lyranus</hi> then is deceiued, who thinketh that in this name there is relation to that
iudgement which Daniel awarded against the two adulterous Elders, which wrongfully
accused <hi>Susanna:</hi> for that storie was not of Dauiels writing, neither is found in the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
as afterward shall more fully be declared.</p>
                        <p>3. There was another Daniel Dauids second sonne by Abigail, who also is called <hi>Chile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah:</hi>
but he was long before those times: 2. Sam. 3. 3. 1. Chron. 3. 1.</p>

                        <head>Quest. 3. Of the kindred of Daniel.</head>
                        <p>1. Hierome in his preface to Daniel writeth, that the Septuagint in the beginning of the
historie of Susanna, which they make the 14. chapter of this booke, doe affirme that Daniel
was of the tribe of Leui: whereupon Bellarmine thinketh that there were two Daniels,<note place="margin">Bellar. lib. 1. de verb. Dei. c. 9.</note> one
of the tribe of Iudah, who writ the prophesie, the other of the tribe of Leui. But herein
<hi>Perfrius,</hi> of his owne sect and societie, contradicteth him,<note place="margin">Perer. praesat. i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> Daniel.</note> shewing that neither the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue
of the Iewes then, nor the Church of Christ now, euer acknowledged any more,
then one Daniel to be a writer of Scripture.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Dionysius Carthusianus</hi> thus remooueth the doubt, that Daniel was by his fathers side
of Leui,<note place="margin">Lib. de vit. &amp; obit. sanct. vet. testamen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>.</note> by his mothers of Iudah: so also Isidore thinketh, that Daniel was both of the
kindred of the Priests and the kings: because it was vsuall for those tribes to match toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Mariage: <hi>Pererius</hi> also reiecteth this as an humane coniecture without any ground
of the Scripture: <hi>Praefat. in Daniel.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. His opinion then is that Daniel was of the kings stocke, and that in him and the rest
was fulfilled the prophesie of Isaiah to Hezekiah, that his sonnes, that is, his posteritie
should be carried captiue into Babylon. Of the same opinion that he was <hi>ex genere regio,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">2. king. 20. v. 17. Lib. 10. antiqu. c. 11.</note>
of the kings stocke, are <hi>Bullinger, Osiander,</hi> with others: <hi>Iosephus</hi> also saith that he was of
the kinsmen of Zedekiah king of Iudah.</p>
                        <p>But this is no necessarie argument, for that prophesie might be accomplished in either of
the kings stocke, as well as in Daniel: And Iosephus may be deceiued in this, as in the like
conceit that Daniel was a gelded man, and made an Eunuch:<note place="margin">Orig. hom. 7. in Matth.</note> so thinketh also Origen: their
coniecture is, because <hi>As<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>penaez</hi> to whose care and charge Daniel was committed, is said to
be the chiefe <hi>Sarisim</hi> of the Eunuchs; but this is no sure argument: for Pharaoh, Genes. 37. is
called by that name, who had both wife and children. <hi>Caluin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. Wherefore concerning Daniels kindred somewhat is certaine, that he was of the
tribe of Iudah: which is euidently expressed, c. 1. v. 6. <hi>Polan.</hi> some things are vncertaine,
as, 1. Whether he were of the kings seede: for they were of the kings seede, and of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
v. 3. therefore not all of the kings seede. <hi>Iun.</hi> 2. It is vncertaine likewise that Daniels

                        <head>Quest. 4. Why Daniels kindred is not particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
expressed in the text.</head>
                        <p>1. Some thinke the reason is, because this is an historicall, rather then a Propheticall
booke: but this is no good answer: for so the booke also of Nehemiah is historicall, and yet
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:18834:6"/>
his kindred is expressed, the words of Nehemiah the sonne of Hachaliah.</p>
                        <p>2. Some make this the cause: Daniel his kindred was well knowne, and therefore it
needed not to be expressed: So was Isaiahs and Ieremiahs, and their kindred well knowne,
and yet it is set downe in the beginning of their prophesie.</p>
                        <p>3. Neither was this the reason, why Daniel inserteth not his name, because among
the Chaldes he was called by another name, Belthazar: for c. 10. 2. he saith, <hi>I Daniel was
in heauinesse.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Pererius</hi> saith, <hi>causam satis idoneam &amp; probabilem, &amp;c.</hi> I can finde no meete or
probable cause hereof, why Daniels genealogie is not expressed.</p>
                        <p>5. Vnlesse this reason may be yeelded, that those Prophets haue their kindred expressed,
which were specially sent from the Lord vpon some message and embassage to his people,
as <hi>Isaiah, Ieremiah,</hi> with the rest: not they which onely had visions, without any such spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
commission: which obseruation notwithstanding doth not alwaies hold: for Salomon
had no such propheticall commission: and yet he is described by his parentage, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 1. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon

                        <head>Quest. 5. When Daniel beganne to prophesie,
and at what age.</head>
                        <p>1. <hi>Pererius</hi> thinketh that Daniel was some 10. yeare old when he went into captiuitie,
in the third yeare of king Iehoiakim, beeing borne, as he supposeth, about the 25. yeare of
Iosias raigne: but this cannot be so, that Daniel was then so young: for 5. yeares after
this he expounded Nebuchadnezzars dreame, which was the 2. yeare after they stood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the king. c. 2. 1. their three yeeres of education beeing expired. c. 1. 5. And vpon that
occasion Daniel began to be famous for his wisedome, celebrated by the Prophet Ezekiel,
c. 28. 3. <hi>thou art wiser then Daniel.</hi> And before that the same Prophet maketh mention of
Daniel for his pietie, ioyning him with <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Iob:</hi> of whom the Lord saith, that they
should onely saue their owne soules, <hi>they shall neither deliuer sonne nor daughter,</hi> c. 14. 20.
it seemeth then that Daniel was of yeares to haue sonnes and daughters. Daniel then within
fiue yeares of his captiuitie growing into such fame for his wisedome, could not be so very
a child, as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> maketh him, and <hi>Isidorus,</hi> the one calling him <hi>infantem,</hi> an infant, the
other, <hi>puerum,</hi> a boy, when he went into captiuitie: he was rather 17. or 18. yeare olde, as
<hi>Osiander</hi> coniectureth. The ground of <hi>Pererius</hi> opinion is, because Daniel in the storie of
Susanna is called a <hi>young</hi> child, when he deliuered her from her false accusers: which he
thinketh to haue fallen out in the beginning of Daniels captiuitie, in the 12. yeare of his
age: but that is a weake ground which is taken from an Apocryphall storie.</p>
                        <p>2. Some thinke that Daniel began to prophesie one yeare after Ezechiel, who prophesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the yeare of the world 3359. and Daniel <hi>ann. 3360. Polanus:</hi> but that is not like: for
Daniel prophecied in the 5. yeare of his captiuitie, when he interpreted the kings dreame,
which was in the 8. yeare of Iehoiakims raigne, for in the third yeare he went into captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
but Ezekiel began to prophesie in the 5. yeare of <hi>Iehoiakims</hi> or Ieremias captiuity, Ezek.
1. 3. which was 8. yeeres after the 5. yeare of Daniels captiuitie. And how could Ezekiel
in his prophesie commend the wisedome of Daniel, if before that time he had not shewed
it in the interpretation of dreames.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore it is more probable, that Daniel began his prophesie before Ezekiel: yet not
so long before,<note place="margin">Praefat. in Dan.</note> as Theoderet thinketh, that is 12. yeeres: for so long it was from the 3. yeere
of Iehoiakim, who raigned 11. yeares, when Daniel was carried away, to the 5. yeare of
Iechonias captiuitie. But we must not beginne Daniels prophesie so soone, which was in the
5. yeere of his captiuitie, after the three yeeres of his education, and two yeares more of his
seruice and ministring before the king: though the historie of Daniel take beginning
from the 3. yeare of Iehoiakim when Ierusalem was besieged: Daniel then beginning to
prophesie in the interpretation of dreames, in the 5. yeare of his captiuitie, which was the
8. yeere of Iehoiakim, began some 6. or 7. yeeres before Ezekiel to shewe his propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call

of Daniel by the Prophet Ezechiel, was at the least in the 6. yeare of Iechonias captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
Ezech. 8. 1. which was the 14. yeare of Daniels beeing in Babel: for he going thither in
the 3. yeare of Iehoiakim, who raigned 11. yeares, was there eight yeares of Iehoiakims
raigne, and then followed the 6. yeares of Iechonias captiuitie: but the occasion of <hi>Pappus</hi>
error is, for that he maketh the third yeare of Iehoiakim, which he counteth from the time
when he became tributarie to the King of Babel, which was in his 8. yeare; in deede the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuenth
yeare of his raigne: which shall be shewed afterward to be otherwise, in the 1. v. of
the 1. chapter.</p>
                        <p>2. But <hi>Pappus</hi> collecteth well, that 5. yeares after this, the same yeare wherein Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
was taken, that Daniel was celebrated by Ezechiel for his singular wisdome, c. 28. 3.
which was in the 11. yeare of Iechonias captiuitie, Ezech. 26. 1. and the last yeare of Zede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah
his raigne: which was in the yeare of the world 3365.</p>
                        <p>3. When Nebuchadnezzer set vp the golden image, c. 3. it is vncertaine, the time beeing
not expressed: but it is like it was after the destruction of Ierusalem and other nations, when
Nebuchadnezzer was now become great, and puffed vp with his victories.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Pappus</hi> thinketh that 10. yeares after, in the yeare 3375. Nebuchadnezzer had his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
dreame of the great tree, c. 4. but that cannot be: for this dreame the King had after he
had conquered the nations, and subdued Egypt, which was the last, and this was after the
27. yeare of the captiuitie of Iechonia, Ezech. 30. 1. but the 3375. was but the 21. yeare of
his captiuitie, 10. yeare after the taking of Ierusalem, in the 11. yeare of Zedekiah. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

but he was then at the least 90. yeares of age: for he had beene in captiuitie 75. yeares: from
the beginning of Nebuchadnezzers raigne (which concurred with part of the 3. and 4. yeare
of Iehoiakims raigne, Ierem. 25. 1.) who raigned 45. yeares, and Evilmerodach his sonne 30.

                        <p>7. <hi>Pererius</hi> taketh it, that Daniel expounded the writing vpon the wall to king Baltha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,
when he was an 100. yeare old: but that cannot agree with his former computation, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he holdeth that he was but 80. yeare old, when he saw these visions in the 1. and 3. yeare
of Balthazar: for he raigned in all but 3. yeares: though indeede Daniel was then toward an
100. yeare old. Againe, <hi>Pappus</hi> is deceiued, who maketh 10. yeares space betweene the time

had but three yeares in all, as it may thus be gathered: The captiuitie continued 70. yeares:
which must begin from Iechoniah his captiuitie, in the 37. yeare whereof began <hi>Evilmero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dach</hi>

                        <p>1. <hi>Isidorus</hi> giueth vnto Daniel an 110. yeares, and thinketh he liued vnto the raigne of
<hi>Darius Hystaspes:</hi> but this assertion ouerthroweth it selfe: for from the third yeare of Iehoia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kim,
when Daniel went into captiuitie, vntill the raigne of Darius Hystaspes, are counted
an 128. yeares, vnto the which the age of Daniel beeing added, which <hi>Pererius</hi> holdeth to
haue beene but tenne, all his yeares will make an 138. <hi>Perer. praefat.</hi>

                        <p>2. <hi>Pappus</hi> counteth from Daniels first captiuitie <hi>ann.</hi> 3354. vnto the 3. yeare of Cyrus,
which he maketh <hi>ann.</hi> 1438. 92 yeares: but he is much deceiued: for they can come but to
82. yeares: for the 3. yeare of Iehoiakim, was 8. yeares before Iechonias captiuitie, from the
which the 70. yeares must be numbred, which ended the first yeare of Cyrus, then 2. yeare
more of Cyrus raigne must be put too, which in all make but 82.</p>
                        <p>3. Therefore <hi>Osianders</hi> reckoning hath the best ground; who iudgeth that Daniel liued
an 100. yeares: he was 18. when he went into captiuitie, in the third yeare of Iehoiakim, from
whence to the 3. yeare of Cyrus, are yeares 82. which beeing added to the former number,

                           <hi>Iosephus</hi> writeth, <hi>lib. 10. Antiquit.</hi> that Daniel built at Ecbatane in media a goodly tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
which remained vnto his time, so fresh and beautifull, as if it had been but lately builded:
which the Kings of Persia made such account of, as that they made it the place of their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulture,
and committed the keeping thereof to one of the Iewish Priests: but Daniel him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
was buried at Babylon: whereupon this question is mooued, seeing Daniel liued vnto
the third yeare of Cyrus raigne, after the Edict was sent forth for the restitution and returne
of the Iewes, why that he returned not with the rest: To the which it may be answered: 1.
That Daniel beeing now striken in yeares, an 100. yeare old, was vnfit in respect of his great
age, to take so long a iourney. 2. Or rather that he remained to be the protector or defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Iewes which were left behind in Babylon, as many there staied still. 3. But of all
other it is most like, that he was thought a necessarie man to be imployed about the king for
the good of his Nation, and to helpe forward their cause: as Theodoret thinketh, that Cyrus
was taught of Daniel that prophesie of Isai, c. 45. wherein <hi>Cyrus</hi> is brought in by name, that
he should procure the deliuerance of the Lords people.</p>

                        <p>1. This booke is commended by the worthines of the author, the Prophet Daniel a man
beloued of God, to whom he reuealed the mysteries and secrets of his will, whom the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18834:7"/>

concerning ciuill matters, it treateth of the change and alteration of states and kingdomes:
2. For Diuine it hath the most cleare prophesies in all the olde Testament of the time of
the Messiahs comming. 3. Therein are set forth examples of excellent vertues, of absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie
in Daniel: of constancie in the three children, which were put into the fierie ouen:
of pietie in Daniels thrice praying in a day vnto his God. 4. Therein are contained the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
doctrines of the blessed Trinitie, of the resurrection of the bodie, c. 12. of redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and remission of sinnes purchased by Christ death. c. 9. 5. Many admirable and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
things are here set forth, as the walking of the three children vntouched in the fierie

from beeing a king, to liue amongst bruite beasts. 6. yea therein are conteined all wayes

the Propheticall writings, of the which there are three opinions: 1. Some thinke that
the Iewes doe not reiect the prophesie of Daniel, but onely count it among the bookes
called <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, holy writings: for they diuide the olde Testament, into the lawe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the fiue bookes of Moses, and the Prophets which are eight, Iosua, the Iudges,
Samuel, the Kings, Isaiah, Ieremie, Ezekiel, the twelue Prophets: and into the <hi>holy wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,</hi>
as they call them, whereof there are nine, Iob, Dauid, the Prouerbs, Ecclesiastes, the
Canticles,<note place="margin">Hug. in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logom. Hieron. in Daniel.</note> the Chronicles, Daniel, Ezra, Ester. So <hi>Pererius praefat.</hi> Likewise <hi>Hugo Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi>
who maketh two kind of Prophets, some that had onely <hi>gratiam prophecialem,</hi> the gift
and grace of prophesie: others, which beside the gift were especially called and sent to that
ende to prophesie, and in this sense onely the Iewes hold neither Dauid, nor Daniel to be
Prophets.</p>
                        <p>2. Theoderet doth simply reprehend the Iewes for denying Daniel to be a Prophet,<note place="margin">Theodoret. praefat. in Daniel.</note> and
this booke to be any of the propheticall writings: so also <hi>Iunius</hi> affirmeth, that the Iewes
denie this booke to be counted among the <hi>Hagiographa,</hi> or holy writings.</p>
                        <p>3. But the truth is, as <hi>Polanus</hi> setteth it downe, that the Elder Iewes did acknowledge
this booke to be authenticall and canonicall, and equall in authoritie to the booke of the
Psalmes, the Prouerbs of Salomon, the Lamentations of Ieremie, and diuerse of them haue
written commentaries, vpon this booke, as R. Salomon, R. Leui, Ben Gerson, R. Abraham,
Aben Ezra, R. Saadia, with others: but the later Rabbines doe denie the booke of Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el

                           </note> did confesse, that they seldome did
reade the prophesie of Daniel: the occasion whereof he thinketh to be this, because Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
doth so euidently point out the time of the Messiah his comming.</p>
                        <p>4. But this errour of the Iewes in reiecting this prophesie of Daniel may thus further
be refuted. 1. The bookes which are called <hi>Hagiographa,</hi> holy writings, were of three sorts;
either they are taken for those bookes which were laid vp by the Arke, and had the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
&amp; extraordinary approbation by the Vrim and Thummim, &amp; other visible demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
or for such canonicall books, which though they had not that allowance, being written
after the captiuitie, when those visible monuments of the Arke, the Vrim and Thummim
ceased, yet were written by the spirit of God, and commended to his Church: and third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
those bookes were called holy writings, which were not made of Canonicall authoritie,
but onely preferred before other humane writings, and receiued of the Church into some
higher order, though not made equall to the the Scriptures. Now though the prophesie of
Daniel be not of the first sort, yet that it is authenticall and canonicall of the second, it
thus may appeare.</p>
                        <p>The authoritie then of this booke is set forth by testimony both internall and externall:
the externall is either diuine or humane: the diuine, essentiall or accidentall: the humane is
either Ecclesiasticall and domesticall, or forraine or prophane: these further shall thus be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18834:8"/>
in their order.</p>
                        <p>1. The internall testimonie <hi>est spiritus testificatio,</hi> the inward witnesse of the spirit, which
cleareth our vnderstanding: that by the same spirit we acknowledge the Diuine prophesie
of Daniel, by the which he wrote it.</p>
                        <p>2. The Diuine externall testimonie, which is called essentiall, <hi>is consensio cum diuino ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>none,</hi>
the agreement which this prophesie hath with the rest of the Scriptures: and the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
which Daniel hath from the testimonie of Christ, Matth. 24. 15.</p>
                        <p>3. The <hi>Accidentall</hi> is <hi>à signis, &amp; euentis,</hi> from the signes which God ioyned with the
prophesie; as Daniels interpretation of dreames, and his preseruation from the lyons, c. 6.
The euents were the true and sensible accomplishment of the predictions and prophesies
conteined in this booke, as all histories, which doe write of these Kingdomes doe beare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord:
and where these two doe concurre with the truth of doctrine, namely, the signes and
euents, they are diligently to be regarded, Deut. 17.</p>
                        <p>4. The Ecclesiasticall testimonie, is the consent of Gods Church, and generall appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
of the seruants and worshippers of God; which though it be not so forcible to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
vs as the former, yet it is a good motion and inducement ioyned with the rest: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
may be added that testimonie of <hi>Iosephus,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Ioseph. lib. 2. contr. Appio.</note> that all the bookes which were written vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the time of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> were of diuine authoritie.</p>
                        <p>5. The forraine testimonie is the authoritie and allowance, which this booke found euen
among the Heathen: as is euident in that a great part of this prophesie is written in the
Chalde tongue, which sheweth that the truth thereof was euen euident to the Chaldeans:
<hi>Iunius.</hi> And here may be remembred, how laddus the high Priest, shewed Daniels pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie
vnto Alexander the great, and by name that vision, c. 8. how the goate, which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
the Grecians, ouercame the ramme, which betokened the Persian Monarchie, as <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus</hi>
reporteth: whereupon this booke was had in great admiration of Alexander.</p>

                           <hi>Pererius</hi> giueth these foure reasons, and causes thereof. 1. Because diuerse things are
otherwise reported of forraine historiographers, then they are remembred in this booke: as
in the 2. chap. Nebuchadonazer is made the mightiest King vpon the earth, whereas He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus

three kings after Cyrus vnto Alexanders time, whereas there were many more.</p>
                        <p>2. The transposing of the storie, which is often vsed in this booke, is an other cause of
the darkenesse and obscuritie: as the prophesies conteined in the 7. and 8. chap. which were
shewed vnto Daniel vnder the raigne of <hi>Balthazar,</hi> in order should be set before the 6. c.

and make in the vulgar Latine translation the 13. and 14. chap. to be Canonicall.</p>
                        <p>1. Because the Councell of Trent hath so defined them to be held for Canonicall Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

doe hold these parcells to be Canonicall. Thus <hi>Bellar. lib. 1. de verb. Dei. c. 9. Pintus in

                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. The Tridentine Councell or Chapter rather, was no true generall Councell;
but a partiall conuenticle of the Romanists, wherein there were not so many Bishops con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate
or assembled together, as haue beene in many prouinciall Synods. 2. And though
it had beene a lawfull Synod, yet it had no lawfull authoritie to make the canon of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which belongeth onely vnto God: the Church onely is to declare, not to constitute the
sacred Canon. 3. Neither can they produce any generall Councell, wherein the Pontifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
canon of Scripture hath beene confirmed.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Pererius</hi> himselfe giueth instance of many things which are rehearsed in the Popish
Masse,<note place="margin">Peter. ibid.</note> which are not canonicall: as the legend of <hi>S. Catharine,</hi> how her bodie was placed by
the Angels in mount Sinai: the Masse of the immaculate conception of the virgin <hi>Marie:</hi>
and somewhat is taken out of the 4. booke of <hi>Esdras:</hi> all these he himselfe confesseth not to
be of Canonicall authoritie, though publikely recited and sung in their Masse: the argument
therefore followeth not.</p>
                        <p>3. Neither is all taken to be Canonicall, which is cited by the Fathers: for they many
times doe alleadge the testimonies of Poets, and heathen writers: and the later writers doe
produce the authorities of the Elder fathers, <hi>Iustine, Tertullian, Ireneus, Cyprian, Origen:</hi> are
their works therefore to be held canonicall?</p>
                        <p>4. Though some of the Greeke Fathers, therein following the Greeke translation, which
was of great authoritie, doe make these histories Canonicall; yet their testimonie is not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to make that part of Scripture, which is not. And against their iudgement, we may

what to say: If he care not what <hi>Eusebius, Apollinarius, Hierome</hi> thinke or write on this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
why should it mooue vs, what <hi>Ignatius, Athanasius,</hi> with the rest, testifie in this cause?
neither doe I see why the one should be more accounted of, or held of greater authoritie

                        <p>Our contrarie Arguments against the Canonicall authoritie of these additions, are these
which follow:</p>
                        <p>1. They are not extant in the Hebrew and Chalde originall.</p>
                        <p>2. They containe some things contradictorie to the Canonicall histories: as the Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal
storie saith that Daniel was of the tribe of Levi, whereas he is said in the true storie to
be of the tribe of Iudah, c. 1. v. 6.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Iosephus</hi> making mention of all the other histories recorded in this booke,<note place="margin">Lib. 10. antique.</note> yet omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth

through all the elements and creatures in their hymne or song. 2. It was no such miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
thing, but a naturall worke to kill the Dragon with gobbets, and balls of pitch. 3. And
it is without example, that any Prophet was so transported in bodie, as Abacuk was taken vp

memorable, he seldome omitteth: but this argument is vrged, not as necessarie, but onely
probable.</p>
                        <p>4. 1. It is one thing to pray in distresse as Ionas did, an other to giue thanks at large vnto
God, before riddance from the daunger: for that had beene in some sort to tempt God, to
stay longer in the daunger then there was cause. 2. That experiment of Salomons wisdome
is set forth as an act of a prudent and wise man, directed by the spirit of God: but the other
is set downe as a propheticall act: therefore the instance is not alike. 3. Henoch and Helias
were translated out of the world, but not from place to place, as this Abacuk is supposed to
haue beene: and it cannot be gathered, that they reteined their bodies still, when they were
taken vp: but rather, that by the power of God they were dissolued: which we are to thinke
for the honour of Christ, who was the first that in his whole humanitie entred the heauens.</p>

                     <p>12. Trie, I beseech thee thy seruants tenue daies, and let them giue vnto vs of pulse that

                     <p>15. And at the ende of tenne daies, their countenance appeared fairer, and they were
better liking (<hi>more corpulent. L. heb. fatter in flesh</hi>) then all the children which did eate of
the portion of the kings meate.</p>
                     <p>16. Then the butler (not <hi>Melzar,</hi> see before v. 11.) tooke away the portion of their
meate (<hi>heb. was taking away</hi>) and the wine, that they should drinke, and gaue them pulse

                     <p>17. And vnto these fowre children (<hi>children. L.</hi> (fowre) <hi>is. omitted</hi>) God gaue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

                     <p>19. And the king communed with them, and there was not found of them all like vnto
Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Hazariah: therefore stood they before the king:</p>

them, he found them by tenne parts (<hi>tenne fold. L. tenne times. G.</hi>) better (<hi>heb. aboue, or supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour</hi>)

reconciled.</head>
                        <p>1. <hi>Polanus</hi> saith, that the prophet Ieremie there speaketh not of the captiuitie of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoiakim,
as here Daniel doth, but onely of a certaine prophesie deliuered by Ieremie in the
fourth yeare: so that he thinketh the third yeare here named, and the fourth yeare there
mentioned, not to concure together: But that the same time and yeare in both places is sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
it is euident, because the fourth yeare of Iehoiakim, is said there to be the first yeare
of Nebuchadnezzars raigne. Ier. 25. 1. And the last yeare of Iehoiakim which was the 11.
is elswhere found to be the 7. of Nebuchadnezzar, Ierem. 52. 28. and in the 8. yeare of
the king of Babels raigne, 2. King. 24. 12. that is in the end of the one &amp; beginning of an
other; so that if the seuenth or eight yeare of Nebuchadnezzar fall into the 11. yeare of
Iehoiakim, then the first yeare must concurre with the others third and fourth.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Calvin</hi> thinketh to dissolue this knot by the distinction of <hi>Nebuchadnezzer</hi> the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and <hi>Nebuchadnezzer</hi> the sonne: that in one place the one is spoken of, and the other
in the other: but the question is not concerning the yeare of Nebuchadnexzars raigne, but
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18834:11"/>
the yeare of Iehoiakims raigne, wherein Ierusalem should be besieged: so that the doubt
remaineth still.</p>
                        <p>3. Therefore the best solution is, that the first yeare of Nebuchadnezzar did concurre
with the ende of the third and the beginning of the fourth yeare of Iehoiakim, <hi>Vatab. Iun.

                        <p>But Caluin taketh hereunto this exception: that Nebuchadnezzars first yeare cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre

but here the historie of one king onely is set downe: But this comparing of yeares is
more vsuall, in setting together the raignes of diuers kings at the same time, then of diuers
kings one suceeding another: as is most euident in the comparing of the yeares of the raigne
of the kings of Iudah and Israel together, throughout the bookes of the kings: here then
the yeares of one and the same king are not compared together, but the years of Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,

                        <head>Quest. 2. How this third yeare of Iehoiakims
raigne is to be counted.</head>
                        <p>1. <hi>Iosephus</hi> thinketh that it was the 8. yeare of his raigne,<note place="margin">Iosephus lib. 10. antiquit.</note> so also the author of the
Ecclesiasticall hystorie following Iosephus, when Nebuchadnezzar came and besieged Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem:
and of the same opinion are <hi>Lyranus, Hugo Cardinal. Dyonis. Carthusian. Bullin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
Polanus, Pappus,</hi> that the third yeare must be counted not from the beginning of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoiakims
raigne, but from the time, that he was made tributarie to Nebuchadnezzar, which
was in the 8. yeare of Iehoiakims raigne: and from that time he serued Nebuchadnezzar
3. yeares: so that the third yeare from the imposition of tribute concurreth with the 11.
yeare of Iehoiakims raigne, <hi>Polanus:</hi> who thus reasoneth for his opinion,</p>
                        <p>1. The third yeare of Iehoiakim here spoken of, was the seuenth yeare of Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,
Ierem. 52. 28. when 3023. Iewes were carried into captiuitie: but the third yeare of
Iehoiakims raigne was but the first of Nebuchadnezzars. 2. If this were the third yeare
of Iehoiakims raigne, and consequently the first of Nebuchadnezzars, then it would follow
that Zedekiah was taken in the 21. yeare of Nebuchadnezzar, which was in the 18. yeare,
Ierem. 52. 29.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. He is deceiued in thinking that the captiuitie there spoken of, Ier. 52. 28. in
the seauenth of Nebuchadnezzar, was that first captiuitie, when Daniel was carried away:
for there were two assaults and inuasions of the land in the raigne of Iehoiakim, one in
the third and fourth yeare of Iehoiakim, and the first of Nebuchadnezzar, an other in the
11. yeare, which was the 7. of Nebuchadnezzar, whereof Ieremie speaketh.</p>
                        <p>2. The collection and inference of 21. yeares hath no consequence: for from Iehoiakims
3. yeare, who raigned in all but 11. yeares, to the last of Zedekiah, who also raigned 11.
yeares, which make in all but 22. yeares, three beeing deducted, there are but 19. yeares.</p>
                        <p>2. Wherefore the truer opinion is, that this yeare here mentioned must be vnderstood
to be the 3. yeare of Iehoiakims raigne, and not from the time of the tribute imposed. 1.
<hi>Pererius</hi> saith, it is <hi>violenta &amp; dura interpretatio,</hi> a forced and hard interpretation, the third
yeare beeing simply named, to vnderstand it otherwise, then of the third yeare of his raigne.
2. <hi>Iunius</hi> yeeldeth this reason, because Ierem. 25. 1. the fourth yeare of Iehoiakims raigne
inchoate or begunne concurreth with the first of Nebuchadnezzar, then it must of necessitie
follow, that Nebuchadnezzars seauenth must fall into Iehoiakims eleuenth yeare: adde
hereunto an eleuen yeares of Zedekiahs raigne, and so it will fall out that Zedekiah was

                           <hi>Melancthon</hi> herein consenteth, that Nebuchadnezzar came against Ierusalem in the

pray: and after he had serued him 3. yeares, and he then would haue cast off the king of
Babels yoke, then the seauenth yeare after, which was in the 11. yeare of Iehoiakims

an enuie against Iehoia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kim.</head>
                        <p>1. First, Nebuchadnezzar came against him, because he was made king by Pharaoh
Necho king of Egypt, with whom Nebuchadnezzar had warre and subdued his countrie:
and thereupon <hi>Iehoiakim</hi> became tributarie to the king of Babel. 2. But Nebuchadnezzars
hatred was more increased afterward, when as after three yeares Iehoiakim rebelled
against him, and would haue cast off his yoke: then the king of Babel came vp the second
time, and carried <hi>Iehoiakim</hi> away captiue, who after he was dead, was cast out and lay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buried,
according to Ieremie his prophesie. c. 22. 19. 3. But the greatest cause of all was
the purpose of God to punish the wickednesse of the king and his people, for he killed the
Prophet Viiah, Ierem. 26. cut Ieremie his prophesie with a knife, and cast it into the fire,
Ierem. 36. beside there were found in his bodie when he was dead markes of idolatrie, as

                        <head>Quest. 5. Of Nebuchadnezzar the king
of Babel, and how many there
were of that name.</head>
                        <p>1. <hi>Pintus</hi> thinketh that Nebuchadnezzar was a generall name to the kings of <hi>Babylon,</hi>
as the kings of Egypt were called by the name of Pharaoh, and the kings of the Philistins
of Abimelek. And he further is of opinion, that this Nebuchadnezzar had a sonne of the
same name: and that neither of them are the same with that Nebuchadnezzar mentioned in
the storie of Iudith, who sent <hi>Holofernes</hi> against the Iewes: for that was after the returne of
the Iewes out of captiuitie, as appeareth, <hi>Iudith</hi> 5. beside he thinketh, that neither Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar
the father, nor the sonne, was that Nebuchadnezzar, which destroyed <hi>Tyrus</hi>
according to the prophesie of Ezechiel, 26. 7. which he taketh to be <hi>Cyrus</hi> or <hi>Alexander.</hi>
                           <pb n="16" facs="tcp:18834:12"/>
But <hi>Pintus</hi> is in many things here deceiued. 1. It is not to be shewed out of the sacred hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie
of Scripture, that all the kings of Babylon were called by the name of Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,
but the contrarie rather appeareth, for this kings sonnes name was Evilmerodach,
2. King. 25. 27. and his sonne <hi>Balthazar,</hi> Dan. 5. 2. And this <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was the
sonne, not the father: and the second was called great <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> for his great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits,
and many victories: for next vnto this succeeded <hi>Evilmerodach.</hi> So throughout the
whole prophesie of Daniel we must vnderstand the second <hi>Nebuchadnezzar. Iun.</hi> 3. We
easily agree, that neither of these could be that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> mentioned in the booke
of Iudith: for who that was it is vncertaine, and there is small certaintie of any thing in the
booke beside: for <hi>Pintus</hi> will haue that storie referred to the times after the captiuitie: <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rerius</hi>
thinketh it was done before the captiuitie in the time of Manasses: but neither of
these can stand: not the first, for we reade of no Nebuchadnezzar after the captiuitie, when
the kingdome was translated from the Chaldeans to the Persians: nor the second, for that
storie of Iudith maketh mention of the casting downe of the Temple, cap. 5. 18. which had
not yet beene done in the dayes of Manasseh. 4. This <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was the same
which besieged Tyrus, which he besieged 13. yeares as witnesseth <hi>Iosephus,</hi> lib. 10. c. 11. he
could not be <hi>Cyrus</hi> or <hi>Alexander,</hi> for he is called the king of Babel, Ezek. 26. 7.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Pererius</hi> acknowledgeth that there were two <hi>Nebuchadnezzars,</hi> the one here spoken
of, and in the Prophets, the other, whereof mention is made in the booke of Iudith; whom
he taketh to haue beene before this: and he misliketh their opinion, who take this Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar
some for <hi>Cyrus,</hi> some for <hi>Cambises,</hi> some for <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> or <hi>Darius Ochus,</hi> the
last king but one of the Persians: for neither was the Temple yet built againe vnder the
raigne of <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Cambises,</hi> as is mentioned, Iudith 5. and <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> was 200. yeares
after the returne of the Iewes from captiuitie: whereas the storie of Iudith seemeth to haue
fallen out immediately after: Iudith 5. 19. <hi>Pere.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. It appeareth what small certaintie there is of the Apocryphall booke of
Iudith, seeing it cannot be agreed vpon, who that king Nebuchadnezzar was. 2. He could
not be the Elder Nebuchadnezzar: for in his time the temple was not destroyed, but in his
sonnes: but before the time of Iudith it had beene destroyed, Iudith 5. 18.</p>
                        <p>3. Wherefore their opinion is to be preferred that make two Nebuchadnezzars, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

enlarged the riuer, compassed the citie with a treble wall: built a goodly palace, in the space

the Iewes were held in captiuitie 70. yeares: which tearme beeing the stinted time of mans
life, Psal. 90. 10. sheweth that man during the time of his life, and aboade in this world, is

Iudg. 12. 3. Iepthah saith, <hi>I put my life in my hands.</hi> 2. The <hi>hand</hi> signifieth a league or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant:
as the giuing of the hand, implieth the plighting of the troth: as Esech. 17. 18. <hi>He
hath despised the oath, and broken the couenant, yet lo, he had giuen his hand!</hi> 3. It signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
ministerie and seruice: as Exod. 38. 21. <hi>These are the parts of the Tabernacle, &amp;c. for
the office of the Levites by the hand of Ithamar.</hi> 4. The <hi>hand</hi> signifieth helpe and assistance,
as 1. Sam. 22. 17. Saul commandeth the Priests to be slaine, because <hi>their hand was with Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
that is, they were aiding and helping vnto him. 5. To <hi>lift vp the hand</hi> against a place,
is to assault it, and threaten against it, as Isa. 10. 32. <hi>He shall lift vp his hand toward the
mount of the daughter of Sion.</hi> 6. To <hi>lift vp the hands is to pray:</hi> 1. Tim. 2. 9. <hi>I will that the

9. To lay <hi>the hand</hi> also vpon the mouth, is a figne of silence: Iob. 29. 9. <hi>The Princes

and brought backe againe to Ierusalem, and there killed, and his bodie cast without the
walls vnburied, which was after, at the request of the citizens, suffered to be buried. But this
had beene an idle and superfluous course, to carie him to Babel, and recarie him. And beside
it is against the text, that he was buried at all: Ierem. 22. 19. <hi>He shall be buried, as an asse is
buried, euen drawne, and cast forth without the gates of Ierusalem.</hi> and, <hi>c. 36. 30. His dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die

                        <p>3. <hi>Lyranus</hi> and <hi>Caietane</hi> thinke, that Nabuchadnezzar caused Iehoiakim to be bound,
hauing a purpose to carrie him to Babylon, but afterward he changed his minde, and onely
imposed a tribute vpon him: but no such thing can be gathered in the text, that the King al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
his minde for that matter, or laid any imposition vpon him.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Iosephus</hi> thinketh that Nabuchadnezzar commanded Iehoiakim to be killed at Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,

                        <p>5. Wherefore the more probable opinion is, that at this expedition Iehoiakim onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came

was going into captiuitie (the second time that Nebuchadnezzar came vp against him,

farre from Ierusalem: and so he may be saide to be cast out of the gates, that is, the borders

                        <head>Quest. 13. VVhy it pleased God that Daniel and others that feared
God should be taken captiues.</head>
                        <p>Though God sometime thinke good to exempt and deliuer the righteous from tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
calamities, as Noah from the flood, Lot out of the flames of Sodome, the Israelites from
the plagues of Egypt: yet sometimes it pleaseth him that such temporall chastisements
should fall vpon the righteous, as this captiuitie vpon Daniel for these causes.</p>
                        <p>1. The generall reasons may be yeelded to be these. 1. God getteth himselfe hereby
greater glorie in the deliuerance of his seruants, as he did when the 3. children were cast
into the fire, and Daniel into the Lyons denne, and yet they escaped the rage of the one,
and Daniel the crueltie of the other. 2. Hereby also the patience of the godly is tried and
exercised, and others by their godly example are encouraged. <hi>Pin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. The speciall reasons why Daniel went into captiuitie were, 1. that he might be as a
guide and comfort to the people to keepe them in the feare of God. 2. that by this meanes
Daniel might become more famous, and be aduanced for the good of his Church. 3. that
by his meanes these idolatrous Kings and people might come to some knowledge of God.

                        <p>1. <hi>Iunius</hi> vnderstandeth this clause of Iehoiakim and the rest which were carried cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
into Babylon into the land of Shinar: and the vessels were brought into his gods trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie:

were carried into the house of their God, but rather the vessells, <hi>Caluin, Polanus</hi> thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
that the land of <hi>Shinar</hi> is called the house of his God. But beside that this were an
improper speach, to call the whole region an house, which is otherwhere named the land
of <hi>Shinar, Gen.</hi> 11. 2. this house is expounded to be the temple, 2. Chron. 36. 7. <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar

but the Hebrew affix is in the plural number, and therefore is better referred to
the vessels, which also is the neerer antecedent. 3. Neither was Iehoiakim carried at this time
into captiuitie nor brought at all to Babel, as is shewed before, Quest. 11.</p>
                        <p>2. Therefore both these clauses are better referred to the vessels, that he first brought
them into the house of his god, and then laid them vp in his gods treasurie, not conuerting
them vnto any ciuill vse, <hi>Osian. Pintus.</hi> Some thinke the last clause is added, because the
treasurie was a speciall place in the temple where such things were laid vp: first then he
brought them to his owne palace, and then to the treasurie of the temple of his God, which
was also in his house. <hi>Vatabl.</hi>

                        <p>1. This land of Shinar or Shingar was the lower part of Mesopotamia, which contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Chaldea and Babylon, lying vnder the mount Sangara, whereof there was a towne so

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:18834:14"/>
1. their first god was <hi>Bel,</hi> a name contracted of <hi>Behel,</hi> which commeth of <hi>Bahal,</hi> which

erected a temple in Babylon, with a vast and huge tower in the middes, which continued
vnto the time of Vespasian the Emperour, as Plinie witnesseth, lib. 6. c. 26.</p>
                        <p>2. The second god was the Sunne which they called <hi>rach,</hi> that is a king, because he is the
chiefe among the planets: and the Persians call him <hi>Mithra,</hi> as <hi>Iustinus Martyr</hi> saith, <hi>dialog.
in Tryphon.</hi> the priests of this idol were called <hi>Raciophantae,</hi> obseruers of the Sunne.</p>
                        <p>3. Their third god was <hi>Nego</hi> the fire, so called of the brightnesse, which was carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
among them.</p>
                        <p>4. Their first goddesse was <hi>Shacha,</hi> which was the earth, worshipped also of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi>
vnder the names of <hi>Opis</hi> and <hi>Tellus:</hi> of the <hi>Syrians</hi> called <hi>Dorcetha.</hi> In the honour
of this goddesse they vsed to keepe a feast fiue daies together in Babylon: during which time
the masters were vnder the dominion of their seruants: this festiuall: time was called Shache,
whereof Babylon was called <hi>Sheshach</hi> of keeping this feast, Ierem. 25. 27. and 52. 41.</p>
                        <p>5. Their other goddesse was <hi>Mulitta</hi> which was <hi>Venus,</hi> whose priests were called <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae</hi>
or <hi>Natophantae,</hi> the obseruers of faire Venus. <hi>Polan.</hi> But the chiefest of their idols was
Bel, Isay 46. 1. <hi>Bel is bowed downe:</hi> which <hi>Iunius</hi> in that place thinketh was taken for the
Sunne, whom the Assyrians and Chaldeans worshipped: But he was the same who was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Iupiter <hi>Belus,</hi> Plin. 6. 26. as is before shewed: they worshipped the Sunne and the fire

                        <p>1. God thereby would punish the wickednesse and impietie of the Iewes, for it is no
small iudgement, <hi>rebus sacris priuari,</hi> to be depriued of sacred things. 2. Herein also the
Lord shewed his iust indignation against the sinnes of the people, that he would rather <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ijcere

same cause he refused their oblations, saying, <hi>incense is abhomination vnto me,</hi> Isay. 1. 13.
3. The Lord herein also reproued their carnall confidence, thinking that the Temple and
the vessels thereof were sufficient defence vnto them: therefore the Prophet Ieremie saith,
cap. 7. 4. <hi>trust not in lying words,</hi> saying, <hi>the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord.</hi> 4.
And by occasion of the transporting of these vessels, the Lord shewed his wonderfull and
strange workes in Babylon, as by the writing of an hand vpon the wall, when Baltazar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned

as Nebuchadnezzar, and <hi>Euilmerodach</hi> his sonne: but when they grew to be presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

5. God also hereby signified, that he needed not any thing of theirs, as any vessels of gold

                        <p>1. The Chaldeans called in Hebrew <hi>Chasdim,</hi> had their originall from <hi>Arphachsad</hi> the
sonne of Sem: the Chaldeans at the first comprehended the Hebrewes also, for Heber the
sonne of Selah, the sonne of Arphacsad, was the father of the Hebrewes: and Abraham the
Hebrew was borne in Vr of the Chaldees. 2. At the first the knowledge of God did flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish

out Abraham, in whome the true religion should be preserued. 3. The most auncient

institution of schooles, wherein youth should be brought vp in good letters, was very aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient:
for here in Babylon, such as were afterward to be employed in the state, had their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation
in learning. So among the Egyptians they had the like vse, where Moses was
taught the learning of the Egyptians. Among the Israelites 48. cities were appointed for
the Leuites, which were as the common Schooles and Vniuersities for the whole kingdom.
Samuel and Elizeus had their Schooles and Colledges of Prophets. Among the Grecians,
Athens was famous for the studie of Arts: and in Egypt Alexandria: yea, the rude Indians
had their Gymnosophistes: and the Romans had their Colledges of Augures.</p>
                        <p>2. Beside hence it is gathered that the chiefe care of the promoting of learning belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
to the King, as here Nebuchadnezer giueth it in charge.</p>
                        <p>3. And because kings beeing occupied with other affaires cannot themselues attend
that busines, they are to set ouer such places good ouerseers, as here the King committeth

                        </p>
                        <p>4. And as here choice is made of the best wits, and such as were not deformed, to be
brought vp in learning; so such should now be preferred to places of learning, as are like to
profit well in that profession: and not euery spittle, and dulhead to be obtruded and thrust
into such places by fauour, to make a scholler of, beeing fit for no other employment.</p>
                        <p>5. These vpon whome this learned education is bestowed, were the sonnes of Nobles;
whereas in many places noble men thinke it a disgrace to be learned: whereas there cannot
be a greater ornament vnto true nobilitie, then learning.</p>
                        <p>6. Here also it is shewed what they should learne, to be instructed in the knowledge of
the tongues, whereby a way is made for other learning.</p>
                        <p>7. And they must not be alwaies learning: a time is prefixed here of three yeares, to take

they abstained from the eating of flesh.</p>
                        <p>2. There were certaine heretikes, who therefore would eate no flesh, because they held
them to be euill by nature, <hi>&amp; a malo quodam principio conditas,</hi> and made at the first by

4. And some other there are, which haue a peruerse opinion of fasting, which thinke
that the perfection of a Christian consisteth in fasting; or they fast onely for the praise of
men, and opinion of the world. All these are in great error, and doe offend in their fasting,
but Daniels abstinence was of none of these kinds. <hi>Pere.</hi>

                        <p>There were many pollutions in the meate, which serued at the kings table: 1. they might
eate such flesh as was counted vncleane by the lawe of Moses; as swines flesh, hares and
conies, were held to be vncleane by the lawe of the Hebrewes, and diuerse others both
beasts, fish, and foule, as is declared, Deut. 14. which might be notwithstanding vsed as
delicate meates in the kings court. <hi>Pap, Bullinger:</hi> which meates though of their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
they defiled not, yet by the institution of God beeing forbidden, they defiled the
eater, in respect of his disobedience to the lawe.</p>
                        <p>2. Beside they in the beginning of their feasts did praise the gods of gold and siluer, and
so consecrated their meates and table to their idols: for which cause Daniel and the rest ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained.

onely legall, and ceased with the rest of the ceremonies: yet the abstaining from things of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to idols was perpetuall afterward obserued of the Christians, as both is euident by S.

                        <p>It is like that Daniel afterward did both eate and drinke of the kings prouision: for he
was of the kings Court, and was the chiefe officer about the king, and sate in the kings gate,
cap. 2. 49. therefore it is not vnlike but that he did liue at the kings diet, neither doe we
read of Ioseph, that was in the like estimation with Pharaoh, that he refused the kings meat.
<hi>Caluin.</hi> The reasons why Daniel abstained now, and not afterward may be these. 1. Daniel,

of the court, lest he should haue bin intangled, <hi>Cal.</hi> but afterward there was not the like feare,

that the ceremonialls must giue place vnto extreame necessitie: It is no question, but the
people of the Iewes beeing in captiuitie did sometime eate of the meates forbidden by the

angrie with Daniel for making such a bould request contrarie to the kings commandement.
2. neither doth he vrge him to keepe the kings order for his diet. 3. or complaineth of him

within which time, if they had no helpe, they would giue vp the citie: But here Daniel doth
not of any temeritie, or presumption set this prefixed time, but <hi>fidei magnitudine,</hi> by the

                        <p>1. Daniel here preferred not this course diet before the kings delicates vppon any super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious
opinion, as thinking thereby to merit with God, and to be more acceptable for
the meates sake; for according to the Apostles rule, both <hi>he which eateth, eateth to the Lord,

                        <p>2. But this may be one reason why Daniel made choice of pulse and seedes, hearbs and
such like, because such things were not at any time forbidden vnto the Iewes, before or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the lawe, <hi>neque de talibus fiebat oblatio idolis,</hi> neither of such things did they vse to offer

                        <p>1. This knowledge which was giuen vnto them all was partly ordinarie in all humane
learning, which was common vnto them all: the <hi>Vulgar</hi> latine interpreter readeth, <hi>in omni

Magicke, Coniecturing, Inchanting, Iudiciarie Astrologie, and such like, that they might
learne and knowe these <hi>speculatiue,</hi> by way of speculation, to confute them and auoide
them, not to practise or exercise them: as God himselfe and the Angels haue the knowledge
of such things: and the abuse in such knowledge, is either in the too great desire and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
which they haue vnto them which learne them, or in the euill ende, which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound,

                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. But that the verie studie and knowledge of such damnable artes is vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
by this it appeareth, because they which were conuerted to the faith in Ephesus bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
their bookes of such curious artes: which they needed not to haue done, if the hauing
and reading of such bookes had beene lawfull, Act. 29. 2. God knoweth all things, and is
perfectly good, and cannot be tempted of euill: but man is easily seduced and peruerted:
and Angels haue not their knowledge by labour and learning as man hath, but by the light
of their nature: therefore those examples are not alike: 3. euen profitable humane artes

                        <p>1. The profitable inuentions of the heathen, Christians may safely and lawfully vse: for
like as in a tree, there are leaues for ornament, as well as fruite for necessarie vse: so the
soule must be adorned as with the sound precepts of Theologie in stead of fruite, so it must
be garnished with the knowledge of the artes, as the ornaments and leaues. But when any

                        </p>
                        <p>2. The bookes then and writing of the Heathen are fit and conuenient to be read: first
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:18834:18"/>
in regard of some truth, which is set forth in them: 1. for euerie one naturally desireth to
vnderstand and apprehend the truth. 2. yea and the spirit of God is the author of all truth:
so that the light which shined in the darkenesse and blindnesse of the Heathen proceeded
from the spirit of God, the true illuminator of the world. 3. their writings containe many
profitable inuentions and precepts for mans life, as in the handling of morall vertues, of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litike
precepts, of mechanicall artes.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, euen the knowledge of their errors is profitable. 1. that we may know them
to confute and abhorre them. 2. that knowing their errours we may the better auoid them
our selues, and winne others from them. 3. to shewe the excellencie of the Scriptures,
wherein is no error or impuritie, before all other humane learning and writing: for there are
fiue things requisite and necessarie for euerie one to knowe: 1. that the soule is immortall:

how this watchfull God, and most vigilant heauenly father is to be serued and honoured.

                        <p>
                           <hi>Answer.</hi> 1. The Scriptures are indeede alone sufficient for such things as belong vnto
saluation, neither to any such ende doe Christians craue helpe from the heathen; but they
vse them onely as supplies concerning things belonging vnto this life: therefore as kings and

a Christian to make vse of the Gentiles inuentions.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>S. Paul</hi> simplie condemneth not philosophie, as that which consisteth of physicall,
morall, or politicall principles and obseruations: but he speaketh against that erroneous
part of Philosophie and vaine speculation, as in the adoration of Angels, and such like: and
thus the Apostle expoundeth himselfe, in the next words, <hi>let no man spoile you through Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie,
and vaine deceit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. There is not the like reason betweene the writings and sacrifices of the Heathen, for
their bookes may be reade without hurt, one may choose the good and leaue the euill; but
the sacrifices are altogether euill and idolatrous: yet the things in themselues, which they
offer in sacrifice, the abuse set apart, Christians abhore not, as wine, bread, flesh; for they
are the good creatures of God: but the abuse of them to most filthie idolatrie, they onely
abhorre and condemne. <hi>Per.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. Notwithstanding therefore whatsoeuer is, or can be obiected, there is a lawfull and
commendable vse of humane artes and learning among Christians: like as Moses made vse
of the Egyptian, and Daniel of the Chaldean learning, and S. Paul in his writings of the
sayings of the heathen poets: So the Christian Fathers armed themselues against the heathen
with their owne weapons: as <hi>Cyrillus Alexand.</hi> against <hi>Iulian, Origen</hi> against <hi>Celsus, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodius</hi>
against <hi>Porphyrie, Hieronimus</hi> against <hi>Iouinian,</hi> the Apologies of <hi>Quadratus</hi> and
<hi>Aristides</hi> Christian philosophers which were presented to <hi>Adrianus</hi> the Emperour in the
behalfe of the Christians, are fraught with great store of heathen testimonies: so also are
the writings of <hi>Iustinus, Tertullian, Eusebius, Lanctantius, Augustine,</hi> with others.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Lyranus</hi> seemeth to be of opinion, that this gift was habituall in <hi>Daniel,</hi> and that it was
alwaies present with him: 1. because as God gaue the other knowledge, which was an habit
in them, so he gaue Daniel this gift of vnderstanding dreames: 2. there are but three things
in the soule, <hi>potentiae, passiones, habitus,</hi> powers and faculties, as to will, to vnderstand,
passions and affections, and habits as of vertues, arts, and such like: But this gift to expound
dreames, was no facultie of the minde, for then it should haue beene generall, and much
lesse was it any passion, which are most seene in the sensitiue part; therefore it was an habite.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. Both knowledge was giuen to the rest, and this speciall vnderstanding to
Daniel by the Lord the onely fountaine and author of euery good gift, but they were not
giuen in the same manner. 2. naturally in the soule these three things are to be found, but
this gift in Daniel was supernaturall, and therefore is not comprehended in that diuision of
the naturall faculties and parts of the soule.</p>
                        <p>2. Wherfore I subscribe rather vnto <hi>Pererius, donum illud non fuisse in Daniele tanquam
habitum permanentem, &amp;c.</hi> that this gift in Daniel was not as a permanent habite alwaies
remanying with him, as may be thus shewed. 1. An habite which is alwaies permanent, one
may vse when he will, where, and how he will; but so could not Daniel vse this propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
gift of interpreting dreames: for when the first dreame of the king was propounded to
him, he obtained the interpretation thereof by his and his brethrens earnest prayers, and
he desired the king to giue him leasure, c. 2. 16. likewise when he heard the other dreame,
he held his peace by the space of an houre, c. 4. 16. in his heart beseeching the Lord to cause
him to vnderstand it.</p>
                        <p>2. As it was in other Propheticall gifts, so in this: but the Prophets did not alwaies
prophesie, but at such time as the spirit of God came vpon them, and did illuminate them:
as the prophet Elisha caused a Musician to play before him, and then he prophesied: Nathan
when first Dauid consulted with him to build God an house, had then no prophesie or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation
till the night following, 2. Sam. 7. the propheticall illumination then is like vnto
the light, not which is alwaies inherent in the bodie of the Sunne, but which at times shineth
in the aire, and sometime is ouercast: so the prophets could not prophesie when they would
themselues, but as they receiued present illumination, and direction of the spirit.</p>
                        <p>3. Now yet they were still called Prophets, euen then, when they prophesied not, both
because of their vocation and calling, they were threunto appointed by God, as Ieremie,
was sanctified in his mothers wombe to be a Prophet, or because they did often prophesie,
<hi>ex frequentia prophetandi,</hi> they had the name of Prophets. <hi>Pere.</hi>

                        <p>Dreames vsually are diuided into these three kinds, <hi>naturall, humane,</hi> which are called
<hi>animalia,</hi> and <hi>supernaturall.</hi> 1. Naturall are such, which are chiefly raised by naturall obiects,
as when men dreame of meat and drinke being hungrie or thirstie: of such dreames speaketh
the Prophet Isay, 29. 80. And these dreames are incident to bruit beasts. 2. Humane dreames
are such as are raised by the multitude of the busines, wherein men are occupied in the day:
such dreames the Preacher describeth, Eccles. 5. 2. <hi>A dreame commeth by the multitude of
busines.</hi> 3. Supernaturall dreames are of two kinds, either diuine, which are sent of God for
some spirituall instruction and admonition, or the signification of some things to come:

                           </gap>, of diuination by dreames, denieth
that there are any diuine dreames at all: he confesseth that there are <hi>somnia daemonica,</hi> dreams
demonicall or spirituall: but there also he ascribeth vnto nature: his reasons against diuine
dreames are these,</p>
                        <p>1. If there were any such diuine dreames, they should be sent and shewed to the best
and most wise and vertuous men, and not to men of euery sort, as they are.</p>
                        <p>2. If God would teach men, he would rather doe it by day then by night.</p>
                        <p>3. Where God instructeth men, he doth it plainly and manifestly, not obscurely and
doubtfully, as is the reuelation by dreames.</p>
                        <p>4. Bruit beasts haue their dreames, therefore they are not diuine.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Contra.</hi> These arguments are soone answered. 1. Such dreames are for the most
part shewed vnto good men, but not alwaies, least they should thinke that by their worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
they had deserued that grace: and when it pleaseth God to manifest himselfe by such
dreames to other then to the righteous, it is for their conuersion, or for the common good
of his Church: such were the dreames which Pharaoh and Nebuchadnezzar had.</p>
                        <p>2. To appoint the Lord to instruct men by day, rather then by night, is to prescribe
lawes vnto him: he best knoweth the waies and meanes, when and how to speake vnto
mens soules.</p>
                        <p>3. Though dreames are in themselues obscure, yet God giueth also the interpretation of
them, as of Pharaohs dreames by Ioseph, of Nabuchadnezars by Daniel: he leaueth not
men in doubtfulnes and suspense, as <hi>Apollos</hi> ambiguous oracles did.</p>
                        <p>4. Beasts haue in deede some kind of dreames, namely such as are naturall and caused in
the phantasie and sensitiue part: but this kinde of diuine and supernaturall dreames they
haue not: such as was Pharaohs and Nabuchadnezzars dreames, and Iosephs, Matth. 1. <hi>Papp.</hi>

                        <head>Quest. 44. Whether there be any truth or certentie
in dreames.</head>
                        <p>1. As <hi>Cicero</hi> said, that there is nothing so absurd, which is not found to haue beene said
by some of the Philosophers; so some of them haue maintained, that all dreames were true,
and had their certaine signification: of which opinion was <hi>Protagoras,</hi> with other Stoikes,
whose generall opinion was, that the truth consisted not in the nature of things, but onely
in the opinion of men: and that some dreames were held to be vaine and friuolous, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
they saide to be this, because they are difficult, ambiguous, and obscure, and so are not
well perceiued and vnderstood.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> But this opinion is confuted by the Scriptures, beside daily experience, which
sheweth that men haue many thousand dreames, which neuer take effect: and if one of a
thousand agree with the euent, it is accidentall, and by some casuall occurrent, and not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise:
The Preacher saith, <hi>in the multitude of dreames and vanities are many words,</hi> Eccl.
5. 6. he ioyneth dreames and vanities together. The Prophet giueth instance of such vaine
dreames, in an hungrie man that dreameth, and behold (in his imagination) he eateth, and
when he awaketh, his soule is emptie, Isa. 29. 8. what is this els but a vaine dreame? Such
are the dreames of drunken, franticke, couetous men, who dreame of such vaine things as
their minde is occupied in: such dreames are like the apparitions in the clouds, many formes
and fashions are there seene, which are soone dispersed of the winde, and come to nothing.</p>
                        <p>2. Some held the contrarie opinion, that no credit was to be giuen to any dreames at all,
as <hi>Xenophanes, Caliphonius,</hi> and the Epicures, for seeing all dreames were of the same nature,
and some were vaine and friuolous, all must be held to be so. Againe say they, if there were
any certentie in dreames, they must proceede from some certaine causes: either God, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
but it is not like <hi>Deum obire lectos dormientium,</hi> that God should compasse mens
beds when they are asleepe, and cast dreames into their minds: and nature is the cause of
order, but in dreames there is confusion and disorder.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contr.</hi> 1. All dreames are not of one nature, therefore it followeth not, if some be vaine,
that all are. 2. Gods prouidence watcheth ouer men both waking and sleeping: he passeth
not from place to place, but beeing in heauen beholdeth all things, and doth whatsoeuer it
pleaseth him in heauen and in earth. 3. Nature worketh certently and orderly, when it
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:18834:20"/>
worketh by certaine and setled causes: variable and turbulent causes must bring forth the
like effects: but true and diuine dreames are most certaine, constant, and orderly, as procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
from him, who is the author of order.</p>
                        <p>3. Wherefore the resolution here is, that as there are some vaine and phant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

dreames procured by mens distempered humours in their bodies, or their disordered and
vnsetled imaginations in their minde; so there are diuine, profound, and holy dreames: as
were the dreames and visions by night of Abraham, Abimelech, Iaakob, Laban, Ioseph,
Pharaoh, Salomon, Nebuchadnezzer, Paul, Act. 16. 9. which holy dreames and visions had
their euident signification, and sure effect. <hi>Perer.</hi>

                        <head>Quest. 45. Of the causes of true dreames.</head>
                        <p>1. <hi>Plato</hi> his opinion was,<note place="margin">Plato in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivto.</note> that dreames were procured by spirits, who were the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
that went between God and man: he thought that God himselfe did not meddle with
humane affaires, but by the mediation and entercourse of such spirits, and that by them ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all dreames were procured. But the contrarie is euident, that some dreames are wrought
onely by naturall meanes, as by the multitude of busines in the day, Eccles. 5. 2. and where
there is any spirituall cause, that the Lord himselfe sometime is the agent, as it is said, God
came to Abimelech in a dreame, Gen. 20. 3.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Aristotle</hi> on the contrarie held, that all true dreames proceeded of naturall causes: but
that is vntrue also: for the prediction and foretelling of things to come, which often is shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in dreames, cannot by any naturall meanes be searched out.</p>
                        <p>3. The <hi>Stoikes</hi> made three causes of dreames, God, fatall necessitie, and the libertie of
the soule, which in sleepe is free from all other perturbations. <hi>Contr.</hi> The first cause we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
but not of all dreames: but fatall necessitie there is none, for then God who is most free,
should himselfe be tied to such fatall necessitie, and connexion of causes: and if the freenesse
of the soule in sleepe caused such dreames, then one should as well haue such dreames as an
other: for in the time of rest euery mans soule is free from the busines of the day.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Porphyrius</hi> thinketh, that the notions which are naturally in the soule, which it brought
with it into the bodie, are the causes of dreames: which notions shew more freely in the
night, then in the day. But Christian religion acknowledgeth no such former notions, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existence
of the soule before it came to the bodie: for the Lord formeth the spirit of man
within him, Zachar. 12. 1.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi>Synesius</hi> maketh the phantasticall part of the soule to be the cause of dreames: that as
the representations of diuers things are raised in the phantasie, so the soule thereupon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth
dreames: and therefore <hi>Pythogoras</hi> going to bed vsed to fall asleepe with the sound
of the harpe, and so prepared himselfe to haue quiet and pleasant dreames. But yet the cause
appeareth not, why such imaginations and representations should be raised vp in the phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasie:
the phantasie affecteth the soule, but how commeth the phantasie to be so affected
first?</p>
                        <p>6. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> maketh two causes of dreames,<note place="margin">Lib. de insom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nijs.</note> the diuine and supernaturall instinct,
which is infused of God, and the naturall disposition of the bodie: for as the humours are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected;
if there be emptines or fulnesse, or any distemperature in the bodie, the dreames are
answerable. But as these are the true causes of diuine, and naturall dreames: so of other
dreames other causes must be found out. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> then toucheth the true causes of some,
but not of all dreames.</p>
                        <p>7. <hi>Gregorie</hi> maketh sixe causes of dreames: 1. the fulnes or emptines of the bodie: 2. the
diu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ne cogitations: 3. the illusion of Satan: 4. the illusion of Satan and mans thoughts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:
5. the diuine reuelation: 6. the diuine instinct and humane thoughts concurring to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
But as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> alleadged not all the causes; so <hi>Gregorie</hi> maketh more causes
then he needeth, as now shall be shewed.</p>
                        <p>8. As then there are fowre sort of dreames, as hath beene before declared, Quest. 42. so
there are fowre causes of the same.</p>
                        <p>1. Naturall dreames proceede of naturall causes; as cholerike men dreame of fire, phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matike
of water, melancholike men of darknes and blacknes: and any distempered humour
or affected part of the bodie often raiseth a dreame agreeable,<note place="margin">Lib. de prae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

dreamed that one of his legges was made of stone, and presently after he was taken with a
palsie and nummenesse in that legge.<note place="margin">Lib. 7. c. 50.</note> And <hi>Plinie</hi> writeth how <hi>P. Cornelius Ruffinus</hi> in his
sleepe thought that he suddenly became blind, and when he awaked, he was blind in deede.</p>

                           <pb n="33" facs="tcp:18834:20"/>
2. Of humane dreames, humane affaires are the cause, which leaue a strong impression in
the minde, whereby such like dreames are engendred in the night, as the thoughts were in
the day: so mariners dreame of the sea and fish, husbandmen of the fields, shepheards of their
sheepe: of this kind was <hi>Hannibals</hi> dreame, who hauing now swallowed Italie in his desire,
as he transported his armies from Spaine thither he had a dreame, wherein he saw a most hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous
serpent destroying and deuouring all where he went: this dreame was answerable to
his desire, and seemed to issue forth of his former thoughts.</p>
                        <p>3. The third sort of dreames is Diabolicall, which Satan casteth into mens mindes to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
and deceiue them, and of these the Deuill is the author, who is the third generall cause
of dreames: for if some dreames were not caused by Satan, why should the Lord condemne
such dreamers of dreames, which should goe about to seduce and deceiue the people, Deut.
13. 1. Of this kinde may be thought <hi>Alexanders</hi> dreame to haue beene, who (comming to
<hi>Ptolome</hi> the next king of Egypt after beeing sore wounded by a venemous dart, and of that
wound like to die) fell asleepe by him, and in his sleepe saw a serpent bringing a roote in his
mouth, shewing the place where it grew, whereby <hi>Ptolome</hi> was healed.</p>
                        <p>These Sathanicall dreames are of two sorts: for some of them doe prognosticate of things
to come, which Sathan can foretell two waies, either by naturall causes he can foresee the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents,
or he doth foretell such things as he knoweth he is permitted of God to doe: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kind of Diabolicall dreames tendeth to the inciting and stirring vp of men to sinne, as
murder, lust, or other vngodlines.</p>
                        <p>4. The fourth cause of dreames, is God himselfe, who by dreames and visions in the
night diuersly instructeth men, and teuealeth vnto them things to come. <hi>ex Perer.</hi>

                        <head>Quest. 46. How Diabolicall, and Diuine dreames
may be discerned.</head>
                        <p>1. Diabolicall dreames are discerned, 1. by the matter, if they be vnchast and vncleane
dreames prouoking vnto any vice or impietie: 2. by the ende, if one shall haue a reuelation
in a dreame of things to come, whereof there is no profitable ende, but onely the feeding of
mens curiositie, or the maintaining of superstition. 3. by mens persons also a coniecture
may be made; as if vncleane and corrupt dreames be offered vnto godly and righteous
men: therein they are to suspect the craft of Satan, that he goeth about to assault and tempt
them.</p>
                        <p>2. Concerning Diuine dreames they are two waies principally discerned: by the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie
of the matter, as when things to come are reuealed, the knowledge whereof onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
vnto God, or the Lord discouereth mans secret thoughts, which he onely can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrie:
the other way is by the illumination of the minde, when the Lord doth so euidently
reueale himselfe vnto the soule and minde of man, that he nothing doubteth of the author
of those dreames, but knoweth assuredly, that the Lord spake vnto him in a dreame: such
were the dreames which Abraham, Ioseph, Daniel, Paul had: for like as naturally the soule
hath light to discerne of the first notions and principles; so the minde in this case is illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
to acknowledge the diuine instinct.</p>
                        <p>3. In diuers manners and to diuers purposes doth the Lord speake vnto men in dreames:
1. sometime he terrifieth and feareth them, as he staied Abimelek and Laban by fearefull
dreames, that they should doe no hurt, the one to Abraham, the other to Iaakob. 2. some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
the Lord encourageth men by dreames to enterprise some great worke, as he
did Gedeon, Iudg. 7. 9. 3. he admonisheth some by dreames, what they should doe, as Paul,
Act. 16. and Ioseph, Matth. 1. 4. God instructeth by dreames concerning things to come,
as he did in Pharaohs and Nabuchadnezzers dreames.</p>
                        <p>4. And as the endes, and purposes are diuers, why the Lord sendeth dreames; so also the
kinds are diuers. 1. some diuine dreames are plaine and manifest, and neede no interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
such were the dreames of Ioseph of the starres, and the sheaues. 2. sometime God
speaketh with them himselfe in their dreames, as with Abimelech, Gen. 20. sometime an
Angel appeareth, as to Ioseph, Matth. 1. sometime a man, as to Paul, Act. 16. 3. sometime
God sendeth dreames not expected or desired, such were Pharaohs and Nebuchadnezzers
dreames: sometime they are first craued and desired, as God reuealed vnto Daniel in a visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by night the interpretation of Nebuchadnezzers dreame, which he himselfe had before
begged and intreated by prayer. 4. and some diuine dreames are answerable to the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
thoughts of the heart, as Iosephs dreame was to direct him what he should doe with
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:18834:21"/>
Marie, whome he was carefull of before, and much troubled in himselfe about that matter.</p>

such spirituall direction, as in the night.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, that dreames come in the night, <hi>propter noctis silentium, &amp; sens<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           <note place="margin">Lib. de divinat. somnijs.</note> because of the silence of the night, and the rest and intermission of
the senses: and the soule then beeing not hindred, neither by the occurrent busines of the
day, nor by the employment of the senses, is more readie and free to attend vpon God.</p>
                        <p>3. Beside the night is secret, and so the Lord may then secretly insinuate his will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any disturbance of the partie, or obseruation of others, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>4. By this it appeareth also <hi>quanto sit Deus potentior ad hominem docendum, &amp;c.</hi> how
much more powerfull God is to teach and instruct man, then any other can: for one man
onely can instruct another waking, and giuing attention; but God can instruct men in their

                           <hi>Averroes</hi> hath this opinion, he denieth not but that a man in sleepe may haue a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall
instinct, yet he thinketh that other artes and sciences cannot be inspired by that
meanes, which are onely attained vnto by precept and experience, and by the helpe of the
outward sense. But herein he sheweth his ignorance, not knowing the Scriptures, and the
power of God: for though ordinarily artes are learned by such meanes, yet God hath infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
knowledge without any such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>5. Adde further, that seeing sleepe is an image and representation of death, by this
meanes we are taught, that the soule liueth after the death of the bodie, and hath more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
knowledge and illumination, then while it was in the bodie: as more visions and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
haue beene shewed vnto men in their dreames, their bodie beeing asleepe, then when
they were awake.</p>

                        <head>Quest. 48. Why visions and dreames are often shewed vnto
simple and vnlearned men.</head>
                        <p>1. By this one reason <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and after him <hi>Cicero</hi> would eleuate the authoritie of
diuine dreames: for thus they obiect, that if there were any such diuine dreames giuen vnto
men by God, <hi>ea non obscuris &amp; indoctis hominibus, sed viris sapientia praeditis dari par erat,</hi>
it was meete they should be giuen not vnto obscure and vnlearned men, but vnto such as
were wise, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>2. To this obiection we thus answer: 1. that such Sathanicall dreames as were vsed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the heathen, were inspired into the simple, ignorant, and superstitious, that were apt
to beleeue any thing, that they might not perceiue the fraud of those spirits, whose oracles
were vaine, and void of truth, doubtfull and ambiguous. 2. but diuine dreames in deede
were for the most part reuealed vnto wise and prudent men, as vnto Abraham, Ioseph, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,
Daniel. 3. sometime also such dreames were sent vpon meane men of no great lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
or wisdome in the world, but they were such as were deuout and religious: which their
holines and pietie did make them more capable of heauenly visions and reuelations; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the wisdome and greatnes of this world doth puffe man vp, and so is an impediment and
obstacle to such mysticall instructions. 4. God also hath sometime giuen such dreames vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
wicked and impious men, as to Pharaoh, Nebuchadnezzer: but then such dreames were
shewed them, not for their owne benefit, but for the good of Gods Church: and beside
though they had dreames, yet they had not the interpretation of them, but therein vsed the
helpe of Gods seruants, as Pharaoh of Ioseph, Nabuchadnezzar of Daniel.</p>

                     <div n="50" type="question">
                        <head>Quest. 49. Why dreames are not alwaies cleare and manifest,
but darkely and obscurely propounded.</head>
                        <p>1. The reason why diabolicall dreames, such as were vsuall among the Heathen, were
obscure and doubtfull, may readily be rendered; because the spirits which deceiued them,
had no certaine knowledge of things to come, and therefore the dreames and oracles which
they gaue, were so doubtfully and obscurely propounded, that howsoeuer the euent was, it
might seeme answerable to the dreame: and if they failed in their hope, the interpretation
should be laid not vpon the reuelation which was giuen, but vpon themselues, that could
not rightly vnderstand it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="35" facs="tcp:18834:21"/>
2. But Diuine dreames either were euident, plaine, and manifest, as the dreames which
Abimelech, Salomon, and Ioseph had, Matth. 1. or if they were obscure, it was for one of
these causes: 1. that they might seeke vnto the seruants of God for the interpretation of
their dreames, as Pharaoh did vnto Ioseph. 2. that the seruants of God themselues might
by earnest praier begge of God the vnderstanding and interpretation of such dreames. 3.
the manifold mysteries shut vp in such short visions made them the more obscure: as c. 2.
the vision of the image comprehended more, then could be contained in a long processe of
speach: such visions the more compendious, so much the more obscure were they. 4. the
Lord thought good obscurely and darkely to reueale his will in dreames, that the truth
might lie as hid for a time, till such time as they were fulfilled and accomplished: as Iosephs
dreames of the bending of the sheaues and bowing of the starres, were not perfectly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
till he was aduanced in Egypt.</p>

                        <head>Quest. 50. What dreames may be obserued, and
by whome.</head>
                        <p>1. To obserue all dreames is friuolous, and superstitious: 1. for this were much like to
the ridiculous customes of the Heathen, that tooke vpon them to coniecture by the flying of
birds, and looking into the entralls of beasts. 2. beside it sauoureth of the Stoicall fatall
necessitie, to think that all things necessarily should follow, as men surmise by their dreames.
3. And if starre-gazing be condemned of the wise, and curious Astrologicall obseruations,
much more is such coniecturing by dreames to be contemned, which hath more vncertentie
in it then the other.</p>
                        <p>2. Some dreames notwithstanding (though not all) may be marked: but yet <hi>Iamblicus</hi>
rule is friuolous; that such dreames as happen either in the beginning of sleepe, before the
minde be ouercast with the fuming vapors of meates and drinke, or in the ende when now
all such vapors are concocted and digested by sleepe, are worthie of obseruation: but those
which come in the middes of sleepe, the bodie then beeing drenched as it were, and fuming
with such vapors, are not at all to be regarded: for this were to limit God, to appoint him
his times and seasons, when he should inspire men.</p>
                        <p>3. There are then naturall dreames, which may be obserued for a mans health: by such
Physitians doe iudge of the distemper of the humours, and of inclination to diseases: there
are also other humane dreames, wherein mens infirmities doe shew themselues, and so there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
perceiuing what vices they are subiect vnto, they may be admonished to amend them:
such dreames may lawfully be obserued, which tende either to the health of the bodie, or the
soule. But diuine dreames are most worthie of obseruation of all other, whereby the Lord
doth often signifie his will concerning things to come: which kind of dreames cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
but by the same spirit wherby they are sent: as Daniel saith to the King, <hi>The secret
which the king hath demanded, can neither the wise, the Astrologians, the Inchanters, and
Soothsayers declare vnto the King: but there is a God in heauen which reuealeth secrets.</hi> c. 2.

                        <head>Quest. 51. Whether in diuine dreames there is a free vse of
reason and the will, and the same acceptable
to God.</head>
                        <p>1. <hi>Pererius</hi> thinketh that in such dreames and visions, there is <hi>soluta vis rationis,</hi> but
not <hi>perfectus liberi arbitrij vsus,</hi> a free vse of reason, but not the perfect vse of freewill, for
to that there is required the libertie of all the senses, and powers, that then <hi>homo</hi> should be
<hi>Dominus sui,</hi> Lord of himselfe.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. In that sense, man hath no perfect vse of free will neither waking nor slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
to be as Lord of himselfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to euill mans will is free; but he cannot <hi>bonum agere, nisi à
bono agatur,</hi> doe any good, vnlesse he be drawne thereunto of God, which is good: 2.
but the vse of the reason and will is otherwise as free in such visions and dreames, as when
men are waking: for the soule and vnderstanding sleepeth not, neither is bound in sleepe,
but the sense onely: And this notably appeareth by that heauenly dreame and vision, which
Salomon had, 1. King 3. 5. wherein both God first bid Salomon aske what he would, and
he asked wisedome; and God approoued this his petition, and actually gaue him his request:
and all this was done while he was asleepe: Salomon could not haue made such request of
God, nor the Lord accepted it, if it had beene a fansie and imagination onely in his sleepe:
But to this diuers answeres are made;</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="36" facs="tcp:18834:22"/>
1. <hi>Pererius</hi> saith, that Salomon had before made that petition vnto God for wisedome,
which his petition the Lord approoued in his sleepe, not because it was made then, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
But no such thing in extant in the text, of any former petition: the first motion and
occasion was giuen by the Lord himselfe, who said to Salomon in his dreame, <hi>Aske what I
shall giue thee,</hi> and thereupon he made his request for wisedome.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Tostatus</hi> hath an other answer, which <hi>Pererius</hi> rather approoueth then the former,
that whatsoeuer is said there to be done, <hi>non revera, sed per imaginariam tantum dormientis
visionem esse factum,</hi> was not verily done, but in the imaginarie vision of Salomon beeing
asleepe: But this cannot be admitted, imaginarie petitions are not accepted of God, and
they onely haue imaginarie effects: but here Salomon was verily endued with wisedome
euen in his sleepe: for presently after he waked, he perceiued that it was a diuine dreame, and
felt himselfe encreased with that excellent gift of wisedome, which immediately after he
put in execution.</p>
                        <p>3. Therefore it may safely be held, that this was more then a simple dreame: for dreames
are but representations of things past, present, or to come, but here there was an actuall
collation of that, which was shewed in the dreame: It was therefore both a dreame, and a
vision concurring with the dreame; a dreame it was, because it fell out in sleepe, but in this
dreame Salomons soule had free conference with God, in which respect it may be said to be
a vision.</p>

                        <p>2. Much lesse can it be referred to the time of Daniels life, as <hi>Pellican</hi> seemeth to thinke:

before the king, that is, his ministring in the Court, there is more vnderstood then
simply his continuing and remaining vntill that time.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Vatablus</hi> giueth this exposition, that so long he was <hi>minister in aula regis,</hi> a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall

a stone: and out of this he falleth into an other matter, that this was not that Cephas
mentioned, Galath. 2. who was not Peter, but one of the 72. disciples: for it is not like that
S. Paul would reprooue Peter <hi>Pontificem maximum,</hi> the chiefe priest to his face; neither is

too late to checke their owne register: and if the changing of Popes names be groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vpon the change of Peters name by Christ, why did not the Popes before Sergius alter
their names: or why doe they not expect the authoritie of Christ to innouate their names,
but take them vp themselues?</p>
                        <p>2. As for that <hi>Cephas</hi> or Peter whom S. Paul reprooued, he was no other but Peter the
Apostle. 1. for be it admitted, that one of the disciples was called <hi>Cephas,</hi> yet he was not
named Peter too: but this was reprooued vnder the name of Peter: 2. that Peter which
was a pillar of the Church, and to whom the Apostleship of the circumcision was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
was reprooued by S. Paul: but none of the disciples were Apostles, or any Apostleship
committed vnto them. 3. this Peter was one of the chiefe, Galath. 2. 6. but the disciples
were not counted among the chiefe.</p>
                        <p>Neither doe the contrarie arguments conclude any thing. 1. for whence can they
prooue, that Peter was the chiefe of the Apostles: the contrarie is inforced here, that Peter
with the rest gaue vnto Paul the right hand of fellowship, therefore there was an equalitie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them: and in that Paul so boldly reprooueth Peter, it sheweth that there was no su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perioritie.
2. S. Paul speaketh of his twice comming to Ierusalem, first after three yeares,
and then he saw none of the Apostles but Iames: then after fourteene yeares, Galat.
2. v. 1. when he found at Ierusalem, Iames, Peter, and Iohn. This then is a simple collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that at his first comming he saw none but Iames, therefore he saw no more of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
at his second comming. 3. Neither doth the construction of the words helpe him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing at all: for, v. 7. it is onely said, <hi>when they saw, &amp;c.</hi> Iames, Cephas, Iohn, are not there
named: and if they were, if we vnderstand it thus, <hi>when Iames, Cephas and Iohn saw that the
Gospel of the vncircumcision was committed vnto me, as the Gospel of the circumcision was to
Peter,</hi> or Cephas, it doth not follow, that Peter should be none of those three: for it is an v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall

they were such as professed the knowledge both of diuine and humane things,<note place="margin">Clem. Alexand. lib. 1.</note> and were as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistant
vnto Kings: they were the same among the Persians, with the Priests or Prophets in
Egypt, the Philosophers in Greece<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> among the French the <hi>Druidae,</hi> among the Indians the
Gymnosophistes: among the Bactrians the <hi>Samanaei.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. But afterward these Magi fell to practising of vnlawfull artes, to inuocate spirits, and
to confederate themselues with deuills: of whome they learned their enchantments and
coniurations, as Theodoret alleadgeth out of <hi>Porphirie.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. Such were the Magicians and Sorcerers in Egypt, of whome Iannes and Iambres
were the chiefe, which resisted Moses.</p>
                        <p>Most of the Heretikes were Magicians, as Simon Magus, and Menander his successor, and
Marcion, as <hi>Iustinus</hi> witnesseth, <hi>Apolog. 2. pro Christian.</hi> and one Marcus, who by his magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call

and by such Diabolicall practises obtained the Popedome: as Sylvester the 2. Sylvester the

Thus in the aduersarie Church Magicians haue beene had in great reputation; as here
they were accounted of among the Chaldeans: But as Daniel by his godly wisdome obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

after the meaning thereof, to vers. 14. 2. the interpretation giuen by Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,
vers. 46. 3. the effects that followed.</p>
                     <p>1. Nebuchadnezzars dreame is described by the circumstance of time, and
the effects, it troubled his spirit, vers. 1. The inquisition followeth, consisting of the calling
and conuention of the wisemen. v. 2. 2. The conference betweene them and the king,
which is threefold: In the first the king simply propoundeth his motion, to haue his dreame
expounded, vers. 3. and the Chaldeans promise to declare it, so they knewe it, ver. 4. In the
second the king requireth of them two things, to tell him his dreame which he had forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and to declare the meaning, both threatening punishment, ver. 5. and promising re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
ver. 6. and the Chaldeans answer as before, ver. 6. In the third the king vrgeth them
sore, that if they did not, as he requireth, he would hold them to be imposters and decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers,
and punish them, ver. 8. 9. The Chadeans excuse themselues, 1. by the impossibilitie
of the thing. 2. by the example of other kings. 3. by the difficultie, that none could doe
such a thing but the Gods; ver. 11. 3. Then followeth the euent, they are commanded to be
slaine, ver. 12.</p>
                     <p>2. In the second part, there is, 1. the preparation to the interpretation, ver. 14. then the
interpretation it selfe to ver. 46.</p>
                     <p>1. In the preparation, 1. is set forth the occasion, Daniel is sought for with his fellowes
to be killed, ver. 13. whereupon followeth his perswasion with <hi>Arioch,</hi> ver. 16. his motion
to the king. ver. 17. 2. then the meanes are expressed which he vsed, first prayer with the
effect thereof, ver. 18, 19. then a thanksgiuing vnto God both generall to ver. 23. then
particular, ver. 23.</p>
                     <p>2. The interpretation followeth, where, 1. the opportunitie is shewed, how he is
brought in vnto the king by <hi>Arioch,</hi> ver. 24. 25. 2. the preamble to the interpretation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of the kings demaund, ver. 26. and Daniels answer, in these 4. parts, concerning the
Astrologians; that they could doe nothing, ver. 27. touching God, that he onely reuealed
secrets, ver. 28. concerning the king, how he was affected, when he dreamed, ver. 29. tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
himselfe, that he imputeth it not to his owne wisedome, ver. 30.</p>
                     <p>3. The interpretation consisteth of the simple narration of the dre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>me, which consisted
of two parts, the vision of the image to ver. 34. and of the stone which dashed it in pieces,
ver. 34, 35. 2. of the exposition, first of the image and the parts thereof, to ver. 44. then
of the stone, vers. 44. 45.</p>
                     <p>3. The effects are three. 1. the reuerencing of Daniel, ver. 46. 2. his confession of
God, ver. 47. 3. the rewarding of Daniel with gifts and honours, ver. 48. and the aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of his fellowes at his request, vers. 49.</p>

                     <p>v. 1. In the second yeare, in the raigne of Nebuchadnezzer, <hi>I. Pol. (not of the raigne of
Nebuchadnezzer) L. V. G. for the distinction comming betweene, seuereth these two clauses</hi>)
Nebuchadnezzer dreamed dreames, wherewith his spirit was troubled (<hi>troubled it selfe,
Chald.</hi>) and his sleepe was vpon him. <hi>G. I. Pol.</hi> (better, <hi>then left him. V. or was broken vpon
him. Pag.) or fled from him. L. the word is (haiah) was, and the preposition ghal, doth not signifie
from:</hi> the meaning is, while he was in a deepe sleepe or slumber.</p>
                     <p>2. Then the King commanded to call the Magicians, and the Astrologians, and Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
and the Chaldeans, to shew the King his dreames: so they came and stood before the
King:</p>
                     <p>3. And the king said vnto them, I haue dreamed a dreame, and my spirit was troubled
(<hi>Chald. troubled it selfe</hi>) to know the dreame.</p>
                     <p>4. Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in the Aramites language, O King, liue for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer:
tell thy seruants the dreame, and we will shew the interpretation.</p>
                     <p>5. The King answered, and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will
not make me vnderstand the dreame, and the interpretation thereof (<hi>not the coniecture there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
L.</hi>) ye shall be rent in pieces, (<hi>ye shall perish. L. ye shall be made pieces. Chald.</hi>) and your
houses shall be made a iakes. <hi>G. (dunghill, Chald. I. not your houses shall be confiscate. L.</hi>)</p>
                     <p>6. But if ye declare the dreame and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receiue of me
gifts, and rewards, and great honour: therefore shew me the dreame, and the interpretation
of it.</p>
                     <p>7. They answered againe (<hi>the second time, Chald.</hi>) and said, Let the king tell the dreame
to his seruants, and we will declare the interpretation thereof.</p>
                     <p>8. The king answered and said, I know certenly that he would gaine time (<hi>redeeme, or
buie time, Chald.</hi>) because ye see the thing is gone from me.</p>
                     <p>9. But if yee will not declare me the dreame, there is but one iudgement, (<hi>sentence. L.
V. I.</hi> or <hi>law. A.</hi>) for you: for yee haue prepared lying and corrupt words to speake before
me, till the time be changed. <hi>G. I. (the time be passed. L. till there be an other state of things,
V.</hi>) therefore tell me the dreame, that I may knowe, if ye can declare the interpretation
thereof.</p>
                     <p>10. The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said (<hi>Chal. and saying</hi>) there is not
a man vpon the earth (<hi>Chal. vpon the drie ground</hi>) which can declare the kings matter: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not any king, nor prince, or ruler (<hi>mightie Chald.</hi>) euer asked such a question (<hi>such a
saying. C.</hi>) of any Magician, Astrologian, or Chaldean.</p>
                     <p>11. And the matter (<hi>the saying. C.</hi>) which the king requireth, is precious. <hi>I. (rare. G. of
great weight. L. A.</hi>) and there is not any other (<hi>to be found. L.</hi>) which can declare it before
the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh (<hi>with men. L. with mortall
men. V.</hi>)</p>
                     <p>12. For this cause the king was angrie, and in a great furie, and gaue charge to destroy
all the wisemen of Babel.</p>
                     <p>13. So the sentence was giuen, and the wisemen were slaine: and they sought Daniel,
and his fellowes to be slaine.</p>
                     <p>14. Then Daniel enquired of the counsell and decree. <hi>L. Po. (returned the counsell and
decree. C. not answered with counsell. G. or interceded. V.</hi>) of Arioch the captaine of the guard.
<hi>I. (or cheife marshall, or executioner. V. the captaine of his armie. L.</hi>) to the king, which was
gone forth to slay the wise men of Babel.</p>
                     <p>15. <hi>Yea,</hi> he answered and said vnto Arioch the kings captaine, why is the sentence so
hastie from the king? then Arioch made knowne (<hi>declared. G.</hi>) the thing (<hi>the word. C.</hi>) to
Daniel.</p>
                     <p>16. So Daniel went in, and desired of the King, that he would giue him time (<hi>leasure.
G.</hi>) and he would declare the interpretation to the king.</p>
                     <p>17. Then Daniel went to his house, and made knowne the matter (<hi>the word. C.</hi>) to
Hananiah, (<hi>Chananiah. C.</hi>) Mishael, and Hazariah his companions.</p>
                     <p>18. And that they should beseech mercie from the God of heauen in this secret (<hi>sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
L.</hi>) that Daniel with his fellowes might not perish with the rest of the wisemen of

                        <pb n="44" facs="tcp:18834:26"/>
19. Then was the secret reucaled to Daniel in a vision by night; therefore Daniel blessed
the God of heauen.</p>
                     <p>20. And Daniel answered, and said, The name of God be blessed for euer and euer: for
wisedome and strengh are his.</p>
                     <p>21. And he changeth times and seasons (<hi>moderateth. V.</hi>) he taketh away kings, (<hi>not
kingdomes. L.</hi>) and establisheth kings (<hi>setteth vp. G. createth. V.</hi>) he giueth wisedome to the
wise, and knowledge to men of vnderstanding: (<hi>to them which knowe vnderstanding. C.</hi>)</p>
                     <p>22. He discouereth the deepe and secret things: he knoweth what is in the darkenesse,
and the light dwelleth with him.</p>
                     <p>23. I thanke thee and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, that thou hast giuen me
wisedome and strength, and hast made knowne vnto me (<hi>made me to knowe</hi>) that which we
desired of thee: for thou hast made knowne vnto vs the kings matter: (<hi>word. C.</hi>)</p>
                     <p>24. Wherefore Daniel went vnto Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the
wise men of Babel: he went, and said thus vnto him, Destroy not the wise men of Babel,
bring me in before the king, and I will declare vnto the king the interpretation.</p>
                     <p>25. Then Arioch in hast brought in Daniel before the king, and said thus vnto him, I
haue found a man of the children of ludah taken captiues (<hi>children of the captiuitie of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah.
C.</hi>) that will make knowne vnto the king the interpretation.</p>
                     <p>26. Then answered the king and said vnto Daniel, whose name was Beltshatzar (<hi>Baltha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar.
L. Beltsazar. V. Belteshazzar. G.</hi>) art thou able to make knowne vnto me the dreame,
which I haue seene, and the interpretation thereof?</p>
                     <p>27. <hi>Daniel answered before the king,</hi> L. A. (to the king. I. V. in the presence of the king.
B. G.) <hi>and said: The secret which the king hath demanded can neither the wisemen, astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians

                     <p>28. But there is a God in heauen the reuealer of secrets, who hath made knowne vnto

                     <p>31. O king, thou sawest, and behold a great image: this large image whose glorie (<hi>and
the glorie thereof. C.</hi>) was excellent, stood before thee, and the forme thereof <hi>was</hi> terrible.</p>
                     <p>32. This images head <hi>was</hi> of fine (<hi>good, C.</hi>) gold: the breast thereof, and the armes
thereof of siluer; his bellie and his sides. <hi>I. (thighes. caeter.</hi>) of brasse.</p>
                     <p>33. His legges of yron, his feete <hi>were</hi> part (<hi>some of them. C.</hi>) of yron, part of clay:</p>
                     <p>34. Thou beheldest till a stone was cut out, which was not with hands, (<hi>that is cut out:
without hands, caeter. but then the relatiue (which) should be omitted</hi>) which smote the image
vpon his feete, which were of yron and clay, and brake them in peices.</p>
                     <p>35. Then was the yron, the clay, the brasse, the siluer, and the gold broken altogether,
and became like the chaffe of the summer floates, (<hi>where the wheat is threshed</hi>) and the wind
carried them away, that not any place was found for them: and the stone that smote the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
became a great mountaine, and filled the whole earth.</p>
                     <p>36. This is the dreame, and we will declare the interpretation thereof before the king.</p>
                     <p>37. O King, thou art a King of Kings: for the God of heauen hath giuen thee a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
power, and strength, and glorie.</p>
                     <p>38. <hi>And in all</hi> places, <hi>where the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field, and the

                     <p>40. And the fourth kingdome shall be strong as yron: for as yron breaketh in peices,

as yron cannot be mixed with clay.</p>
                     <p>44. And in the dayes of these kings (<hi>not kingdomes. L.</hi>) shall the God of heauen raise

and it shall stand for euer.</p>
                     <p>45. Whereas thou sawest, that a stone was cut out of the mountaine, which was not

faithfull. <hi>V. L. I.</hi> (sure. B. G.)</p>
                     <p>46. Then king Nebuchadnezzar fell vpon his face, and bowed himselfe <hi>. G. B. (worshipped

                     <p>47. Also the king answered vnto Daniel and said, Of a truth <hi>it is</hi> that (<hi>I know of a truth.

                        <head>Quest. 1. vers. 1. How the second yeare is to be
counted wherein Nebuchadnezzar
had this dreame.</head>
                        <p>1. <hi>Theodoret</hi> thinketh that it was the second yeare from the beginning of his raigne: but
that cannot be, for Nebuchadnezzars raigne beganne in part of the 3. and 4. yeare of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoiakim,
cap. 1. 1. and Ierem. 25. 1. and 3. yeares after that were appointed for Daniels e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation,
c. 1. 5. while those 3. yeares were expired, there was no proofe or triall had of
Daniels wisedome; therefore it can not be, that the storie in the first chapter is set downe by
way of recapitulation, as Theodoret thinketh: for till the three yeares were past, they were
not brought before the king.</p>
                        <p>2. Some thinke that this was the second yeare of Nebuchadnezzars raigne by himselfe
alone, who also raigned after a sort with his father, who also was called by the same name:
<hi>Caluin. Geneuens.</hi> But this cannot stand, because the first yeare of Nebuchadnezzar his
sole raigne was in the 3. and 4. raigne of Iehoiakim. Ierem. 25. 1. after which three yeares
must be counted for Daniels education: this then could not be the second yeare of his
raigne alone.</p>
                        <p>3. Some vnderstand here two Nebuchadnezzars, the father mentioned before, cap. 1. 1.
and his sonne, brother to <hi>Euilmerodach,</hi> who beeing the younger was preferred before the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:18834:27"/>
other, and the Elder because of his wickednesse was put by the gouernment, <hi>ex Lyran.</hi> so
also <hi>Emmanuel Sa.</hi> But this Nebuchadnezzar could not be sonne to Nebuchadnezzar the
great,<note place="margin">Ierem. 27 7.</note> and brother to Euilmerodach, for the Lord had giuen the kingdomes of the earth, but
vnto Nebuchadnezzar, and his sonne: that is Euilmerodach, and his sonnes sonne, which
was Balthazar the sonne of Euilmerodach: but if there were a Nebuchadnezzar brother to
<hi>Euilmerodach,</hi> then should there be three beside Nebuchadnezzar the great, and not two
onely as Ieremie saith: there were indeede two Nebuchadnezzars, one called <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar
priseus,</hi> the auntient, the other <hi>Nebuchadnezzar magnus,</hi> the great: who beganne
his raigne the same yeare Daniel went into captiuitie, in the 3. and 4. yeare of Iehoiakim.</p>
                        <p>4. The vsuall interpretation is, that it must be vnderstood of the second yeare of Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzars
absolute Monarchie, after the subduing of Egypt: so <hi>Iosephus lib. 10. cap.</hi> 11.
of the same opinion is <hi>Hierome,</hi> and of the later writers, <hi>Lyranus, Hugo Cardi,</hi> who thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
it was the 26. yeare of his whole raigne, and the second of his Monarchie, <hi>Peter.</hi> also
<hi>Pintus, Bullinger, Pellican,</hi> are of the same opinion: But this cannot stand: for Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar
conquered Tyrus, before he subdued Egypt: for Egypt is giuen him for his wages
for his seruice against Tyrus, Ierem. 24. 18. 19. but Daniel was famous for his wisedome,
(which was not knowne till he had expounded Nebuchadnezzars dreame) before Tyrus
was destroyed: for he is celebrated for his pietie, and therein ioyned with Noah and Iob,
Esek. 14. and for his wisdome, Esek. 28. 3. And then immeadiately in that chapter followeth
the prophesie of the destruction of <hi>Tyrus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>5. Wherefore this second yeare must be counted from the time when Daniel first stood
before the king: in the second yeare then of his seruice and ministrie, Nebuchadnezzar had
this dreame: but where it is added, <hi>in the raigne of Nebuchadnezzer,</hi> these words are not to
be ioyned with the former, <hi>in the second yeare,</hi> as appeareth by the Hebrew distinction, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biah,</hi>
set ouer the word <hi>shetaim, second:</hi> this then happened in the raigne of Nebuchadnezzar,
which is mentioned by way of distinction, because in the last words of the former chapter,
it is said that <hi>Daniel was to the first yeare of King Cyrus;</hi> least any should thinke that this
was done in the second yeare of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> direct mention is made of the raigne of Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar.

                           <note place="margin">Lib. 10. antiq. c. 13.</note> whom Iosephus calleth <hi>Abilamarodachus:</hi> This Nebuchadnezzar then here
mentioned, was he which was surnamed the great. 2. Some thinke, that there was a third
<hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> held to be the sonne of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> in whose time fell out the historie of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lofernes</hi>
and <hi>Iudith, Lyran.</hi> but it is euident in Scripture that no kings of the Persians, but
onely of the Chaldeans were called by that name. 3. Concerning the notation of <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzars</hi>
name, <hi>Lyranus</hi> hath this narration, that he ws so called of this euent: beeing a
child he was cast out, and suckled by a shee-goat vnder a tree, in the which sate an owle,
which a certaine leper passing by wondred at, to see an owle set there in the day, and by that
occasion looking about he espied the child, which he caused to be nursed and brought vp.
So of these three is the name compounded, of <hi>Nabu</hi> which in that language signifieth an
owle, and <hi>chodo</hi> a goate, and <hi>nosor</hi> a leper: But this seemeth to be a fabulous narration: for
whereas Nebuchadnezzar the great is imagined to haue beene so called vpon this occasion,
that is not like, because his father was called by that name before him.</p>

are shewed to the faithfull, as to Iaacob, Ioseph, Daniel; sometime to those which were
not of the people of God, as to Abimelech, Gen. 20. Laban. Gen. 31. Pharaoh. Gen. 41.</p>

                        <p>4. This dreame which Nebuchadnezzar had, was both a diuine dreame, and of this
last sort, obscure and darke, which could not be vnderstood without an interpreter: for
though Nebuchadnezzars thoughts, who was desirous to knowe what should come to
passe after him, ministred some occasion, yet the cause of this dreame they were not; but
Gods hand was in it, as both may appeare by the effect which it wrought, his spirit was
sore troubled, vers. 1. As Abimelech also was in a great feare, after he had the vision in his
sleepe, Gen. 20. and Pharaoh was perplexed after his dreame, Gen. 41. <hi>Polan.</hi> As also Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel

                        <p>1. The Lord did it for Nebuchadnezzars sake, that thereby he might be humbled, and
acknowledge the true God of Israel, and thereupon be fauourable to his people, whom he
held in captiuitie.</p>
                        <p>2. It was done also in respect of Daniel, that by this meanes he might be had in reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and so be exalted for the comfort of the Lords people: as Ioseph for the same cause
was aduanced in Egypt, to be a softer father to his brethren.</p>
                        <p>3. The vse hereof also is generall concerning the whole Church of God, that as these
fower great Monarchies were dissolued by the power of Christ, whose kingdome onely is
inuincible: so God will destroy the mightie kingdomes and potentates of the earth, who
shall band themselues against Christ and his Church.</p>
                        <p>4. Gods glorie also herein is set forth, to whom belongeth all power, and who knoweth
all secrets, <hi>Pap.</hi> So also <hi>Hugo Cardi. vt Daniele interpretante glorificetur Deus, &amp;c.</hi> that
by Daniels interpretation God might receiue glorie, and the captiue people comfort.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi>Lyranus</hi> addeth an other reason: <hi>specialis Dei prouidentia circa principes magnos, &amp;c.</hi>
the speciall prouidence of God is ouer great Princes, because the common wealth depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
of them, and therefore the Lord doth often reueale vnto them things to come, as vnto

Chaldeans then, though it were a generall name of all the inhabitants of Chaldea, yet it was
appropriated vnto a certaine sect and profession of learning among them, which seemed to
be more excellent then the rest. <hi>Hierome</hi> saith, they were called <hi>mathematici,</hi> Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians:

of the Chaldeans.</head>
                        <p>1. <hi>Osiander</hi> thinketh the reason was, because the king did know, that Daniel was not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
in their Magicall artes: but that is not like, for seeing the king had giuen order, that
they should haue beene trained vp in the learning of the Chaldeans, c. 1. 5. it would haue
much offended him, if he had knowne his order had beene neglected.</p>
                        <p>2. It may be therefore that the wise men were afraid to take Daniel with them, least he
might haue obscured them all by his wisdome: and they beeing auncient, thought scorne
that such a young man should be ioyned vnto them. <hi>Perer.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. The king also might spare Daniel, as hauing yet had no great triall of his faithfulnes,
and therefore he would not at the first commit his secrets to a stranger. <hi>Calvin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Peretius</hi> thinketh that Nebuchadnezzer might haue forgotten him in the space of
22. yeares, for so long it was since Daniel first stood before the king. But that cannot be: for
this yeare wherein Nebuchadnezzer dreamed, was but the second yeare from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of Daniels ministie and seruice in the Court, as is before shewed, Quest. 1. vpon this
chapter.</p>
                        <p>5. But herein chiefly we are to acknowledge Gods prouidence, who so disposed, that
Daniel should not be admitted, neither before, nor together with the Chaldeans. If he had
beene called first, the Magicians might haue saide, that they could haue interpreted the
dreame, if they had beene called. If he had come with them, and expounded the dreame, the
Chaldeans would haue ascribed it to their owne skill; and so the ignorance and follie of
them should not haue so manifestly appeared. <hi>Polan.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>6. And further God to this ende would not haue Daniel present with the rest, to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
that he would not haue the professors of the truth, matched or mingled with the assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies

yet after the captiuitie the vsuall language of the Iewes did borrow much of the Chalde
tongue, by reason of their long captiuitie among them: and was compounded partly of the

the Syriake was held to be the more eloquent tongue, <hi>Genevens.</hi> some thinke the Chaldean

Chalde words, but Hebrew charactrs: and then the rest of the booke followeth in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
tongue and writing, as before: now the reasons why these Chaldeans vse the Aramites
language, were these. 1. These wise men were of diuers countries, and so of diuers langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges:
therefore they spake in the Syrian or Chalde tongue, which was knowne and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of all. <hi>Perer.</hi> 2. Some thinke they vsed it, as the more eloquent tongue, <hi>Genevens.</hi>
3. Or because it was the language which the king vsed, <hi>Perer.</hi> 4. Or rather the Syrian
was the Babylonian tongue, which in that respect, was fittest for them to vse. 5. And the
Lord hereby so disposed, that the knowledge of these things should be manifest vnto the
Chaldeans, that euen they might be conuinced of the truth out of their owne acts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords:
which also was the cause, for the more credit of this historie among the Chaldeans,

to seeke occasion to escape the daunger: as the Apostle saith, Eph. 5. 16. <hi>Redeeming the time,

but it is more fitly referred to the interpretation of the dreame, which they would haue shif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

Chaldeans, v. 9. <hi>Tell me the dreame, that I may know if you can declare me the interpretation
thereof.</hi> The argument is this framed, They which can giue the interpretation of a dreame,
can finde out the dreame it selfe: for the one is of a diuine instinct as well as the other: And
to God nothing is hid, he can as well tell what the dreame was, as open the meaning of
it: But ye cannot tell me my dreame: therefore neither can you interpret it though you knew
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:18834:29"/>
it: you are then but impostors and deceiuers. <hi>Polan.</hi> But <hi>Osiander</hi> collecteth otherwise, <hi>non

divinare &amp; interpretari,</hi> to diuine what the dreame was, and to interpret it. But I rather
herein consent to <hi>Pererius, recte redarguit eos Rex,</hi> the king doth with good right reprooue
them: for if they could not tell the dreame, which was now in act, how could they haue
told of things to come by that dreame, <hi>quae nunquam actu fuerunt, &amp;c.</hi> which neuer were in

                        <p>1. Although they erred in holding a multitude of gods, yet herein they were right, that
God onely had the knowledge of things to come: <hi>Pint.</hi> Some thinke that by <hi>gods,</hi> here they

of the power of spirits, with whome they had familiaritie, and now they failed them,
doe meane hereby the superiour diuine power onely. Indeede naturall dreames beeing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
corporall affections and qualities, spirits may finde out; but diuine dreames are of a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall

2. Concerning the cohabiting or beeing present of the gods with flesh, that is, with mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
men, the Gentiles had diuers opinions. 1. The Epicures thought, that the gods, <hi>nihil
extra se agentes, &amp;c.</hi> did nothing at all in the world without themselues, neither were occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied
in doing any thing, but made them idle gods doing nothing. 2. The Peripatetikes
following <hi>Aristotle,</hi> did make the gods onely to haue their dwelling in the heauens, and to
be occupied in the motion of the celestiall orbs, but had nothing to doe, <hi>cum rebus subluna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus,</hi>
with things done vnder the Moone. 3. The Platonists and Stoikes placed the gods
onely in heauen, but they held that there were otehr spirits good and bad in the ayre, which
did conuerse with men: and that the gods immediatly had nothing to doe with men, but <hi>per
daemones tanquam internuntios,</hi> by the spirits, which were as messengers comming betweene
God and man. 4. Wherein they diuersly erred; 1. in making many gods: 2. in holding
that God did nothing in the earth, but by the mediation of such spirits: 3. and that some spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
were good, some euill by nature: whereas the Angels were all created good in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
but some fell through their pride, and were cast downe to hell.</p>
                        <p>5. But concerning the conuersing of Angels with men, the truth is this, that both good
Angels (whose chiefe employment is in giuing attendance vpon God in the heauens) yet
sometime haue appeared vnto men, as vnto Abraham, Lot, laakob: the euill Angels also
more often doe intermedle with humane affaires, for the probation and triall of men, and to
their owne iust condemnation: whereof there are two notable experiments; the one is, in
those which are called <hi>energumeni,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Two experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments shewing the mysticall working of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than in the world.</note> possessed or bestraughted: some such beeing very idiots,
vnlearned, and vnlettered men, haue spoken Hebrew, Greeke, Latine, and disputed of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
questions in Philosophie, and Diuinitie: the other experiment is in the Magicians
themselues, which worke by such spirits, and effect strange things, as in counterfaiting the
shapes of beasts, in causing images to mooue and speake, in telling strange things done farre
off in remote countries: these strange works either to ascribe to melancholie, as some Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
doe, or to the operation of the starres, as Astrologers, <hi>est perquam ineruditum &amp; insul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum,

<hi>extremae impudentiae &amp; contumaciae videtur,</hi> it seemeth to be extreame boldnes and contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie:

                        <p>1. Though by the law of God these Sorceres and Soothsayers had deserued worthily
to die, and so in respect of the diuine iustice, were iustly put to death; yet in respect of the
King, who looked not vnto the Law of God, but followed his owne irefull affection, the
proceeding was vniust: <hi>Polan.</hi> beside their deuillish profession, it seemeth they were ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

                        </p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Lyranus</hi> excuseth the Kings fact, because he had beene at great cost in maintaining
these Inchanters and Soothsayers: he had raised them to honour, giuen them great gifts; and
now when he requireth some seruice of them, they are able to say nothing.</p>
                        <p>3. But yet <hi>Nabuchadnezzer</hi> was diuers waies faultie in this action: 1. in his rash and
inconsiderate sentence, which he pronounced against them in his rage and furie: whereas the
sentence of death should proceede with mature deliberation and aduice: for like as Saturne
the highest of the Planets hath the slowest motion of them all; so Princes which sit in their
high thrones of maiestie should be most considerate in their actions. And as a musitian doth
not presently cut away his strings, if they be out of tune, but doth wind them to and fro, to
bring them to a right harmonie; so neither should a Prince punish euery disorder in the
Commonwealth presently with death. <hi>Pintus.</hi> 2. An other point of iniustice is, that he
had not yet called all the wise men of Babylon, and yet vnheard and vncalled, commandeth
them to be slaine. 3. It was also vniust for some few mens fault, to take reuenge of the
whole profession, and so to punish one for an others offence. <hi>Osiand.</hi>

seemeth, that all they which were in the way, and at hand, and needed not to be sought

                        <p>2. Wherefore it is certaine, that many of these wisemen were smitten with the sword,

may be giuen, it proceeded, <hi>ex inuidia &amp; cupiditate,</hi> from their enuie and couetousnes:
<hi>Lyran.</hi> their enuie, in that they thought great scorne, that so young a man as Daniel, should
be called to counsell with the graue sage counsellors, who were in great estimation with
the king for their long experience: <hi>Iun.</hi> their couetousnesse also herein appeared, that they

                        <head>Quest. 19. vers. 19. How this secret was reuealed
vnto Daniel in the night.</head>
                        <p>1. Some thinke that this vision was shewed vnto Daniel by an Angel, because such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelations
are vsually made by the ministrie of Angels: <hi>Pintus ex Dyonis.</hi> But Daniel ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth
in his thanksgiuing, that he receiued this reuelation onely from God, and to
him onely he giueth the praise.</p>
                        <p>2. And for the manner, <hi>Hierome</hi> thinketh that it was shewed vnto him by dreame in the
night: so also <hi>Glosse ordin. somnium regis discit suo insomnio,</hi> he learneth the kings dreame
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:18834:31"/>
by his dreame: so also <hi>Osian, Lyran.</hi> giueth this reason, because the night is fittest for such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelations,
the senses beeing quiet <hi>ab exterioribus tumultibus,</hi> from all outward tumults: and
that the vision in the night is by dreame, he would prooue by that place, Iob. 33. 15. <hi>God
speaketh, &amp;c. in dreames and visions of the night, when sleepe falleth vpon men, &amp;c.</hi> But this
place prooueth not, that euery night vision is by dreame: but that in the night when sleepe
falleth vpon men, the Lord sometime speaketh vnto them by dreame, sometime by vision.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Albertus magnus,</hi> as <hi>Pintus</hi> reporteth his opinion, thinketh that Daniel had this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation,
<hi>vigilia noctis,</hi> as he watched in the night: and this is the more probable opinion, 1.
because it is called a vision: now visions and dreames are distinguished, as the two vsuall
waies, whereby the Lord reuealeth himselfe vnto his Prophets, Numb. 12. 6. <hi>Polan.</hi> 2. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel
and his three fellowes were occupied in praier while other slept, <hi>Pellic.</hi> and it seemed as
they praied, that this vision was sent, as he saith, <hi>Thou hast shewed now the thing that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
of thee:</hi> it is not like that Daniel and the rest beeing full of care in this so weightie a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines,
would giue themselues to rest; but they awaked, when other slept. So <hi>Hugo Card.</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
this as a reason, why this vision came in the night, <hi>quod tempus magis orationi compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tit,</hi>
because that time is fittest for praier. 3. And presently after this thing was reuealed, it
is said that <hi>Daniel answered and said, The name of God be praised:</hi> but he could not thus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
and praise God in his sleepe. It was then such a vision in the night as Paul had, Act. 16.
9. when a man of Macedonia appeared vnto him, and said, <hi>Come and helpe vs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. Yet this further must be added, that visions come not onely by day but by night, and
not onely when men are awake, but when they sleepe: as Daniel saw a dreame, and had visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in his head as he lay vpon his bed, c. 7. 1. such visions are more then dreames, and differ
in respect of the more cleare illumination, and euident demonstration of things: such was
Salomons dreame wherein he had a vision beside, when actually the gift of wisdome was
conferred vpon him, 1. king. 3. whereof see c. 1. qu. 51. Yet dreames and visions doe differ
in nature still (though they may concurre together) the one beeing but a representation of
the image and similitude of things, the other a demonstration of the things themselues.</p>

                        <p>Daniels thanksgiuing is of two sorts, either generall v. 20. to 23. or speciall and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar:
and either of them consisteth of the proposition containing the <hi>doxologie</hi> or thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
and the probation thereof. 1. In the generall benediction, in the proposition is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
who is to be praised, the name of God, not the letters or syllables, as the Iewes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore
the name Iehouah, the Papists the name Iesus: but the name of God, is God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe:
and the adiunct of the time also is added, <hi>for euer and euer.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. The probation is set forth briefly, <hi>for wisdome and strength are his:</hi> then it is amplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the effects; first his power is declared by two effects, the changing of times and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and the taking downe and setting vp of Kings: then his confidence by three effects: 1.
in giuing wisdome for action: 2. vnderstanding for contemplation: 3. and in discouering
secret things: which is amplified by the cause, taken from the essentiall propertie of God; he
<hi>knoweth what is in darknes,</hi> because with him is light.</p>
                        <p>3. Then followeth the speciall thanksgiuing, with the proposition, wherein Daniel gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
thanks for himselfe: and the probation taken from two effects; in opening vnto them
the Kings dreame according to their desire, and giuing them power and strength, thereby to
preuaile against, and ouercome the imminent danger and perill of death: the latter effect is
set forth in the first place.</p>

                        <p>1. The Lord is called the God of heauen, 1. because he made the heauens, but other
gods haue not made the heauen and the earth, Ierem. 11. <hi>Hug. Card.</hi> 2. And this sheweth
a difference betweene the true God and idols herein: because they are worshipped onely in
the earth, and not in heauen, <hi>Pint.</hi> 3. And God is so called, because he is <hi>habitator coeli,</hi> he
inhabiteth and dwelleth in the heauens, and therefore he saith, <hi>heauen is my seat or throne,</hi>
Isa. 66. 1. not that God is limited and confined in the heauens, but there are the most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and visible signes of his presence. <hi>Pintus.</hi> 4. And by this title is set forth Gods glorie,
greatnes, and power, because the heauens are the most glorious of Gods creatures, and doe

2. To blesse is taken diuersly in Scripture: 1. when God is said to blesse man, <hi>benedicere,</hi>
to blesse, is the same that <hi>benefacere,</hi> to bestowe benefits: as the Lord saith to Abraham, I
will blesse thee, and <hi>make thy name great,</hi> Genes. 12. 2. to blesse here, is to encrease, and
multiplie him, and make him great: 2. when one man blesseth another it signifieth, to wish
well vnto them, and to pray for them: as Rebekahs mother and brother are said to blesse her,
Gen. 24. 60. 3. but when man is said to blesse God, it signifieth to praise him, and giue
thankes vnto him: as Psal. 54. 1. <hi>I will blesse the Lord for euer, his praise shall be in my mouth
continually:</hi> and so is it taken here.</p>

                        <p>There are three kinds of secret things, which the Lord is said to discouer. 1. The myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of religion, as concerning the blessed Trinitie, the incarnation of the Sonne of God, the
life to come: the knowledge of which things a man cannot attaine vnto, vnlesse it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed

                        <p>2. There are the secrets of the heart, which none knoweth but God, who is the searcher
of the heart, saue the spirit of man which is in him: 1. Cor. 2. 11. to none other are the
thoughts of the heart knowne, but onely vnto God.</p>
                        <p>3. The things to come, are great secrets, which onely are manifest vnto him, by whome

his secret place.</head>
                        <p>1. God is said, 1. to be light in himselfe, in his essence, because there is nothing in God
but most pure, sincere, cleare, as also because he communicateth of this light vnto others: as
Iohn 1. 9. <hi>he is the true light that lighteth euery one, that commeth into the world:</hi> both the
light of nature and the light of grace proceede from him: and therefore as <hi>Basil</hi> well obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,

created the light: for like as a most goodly picture, if it be laid ina darke caue, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth

                        </p>
                        <p>2. God also is said to be in light, 1. Ioh. 1. 7. because he can endure no falsehood, hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie,
or vntruth.</p>
                        <p>3. The Lord also is said <hi>to dwell in light, that none can attaine vnto,</hi> 1. Timoth. 6. 16.
because we through the weakenesse of our vnderstanding, and blindnesse of our mindes,
are not able to comprehend any thing of God, vnlesse he by the illumination of his grace
doe make a way for vs to come vnto him.</p>

onely <hi>Deum esse inaccessum,</hi> that God is inaccessible vnto vs, not what he is in himselfe:
and the cloud was a signe of Gods presence, as he said to Moses, Leuit. 16. 2. I will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare

                        <head>Quest. 25. vers. 24. Whether Daniel did well in staying the
execution of the kings sentence vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the wisemen.</head>
                        <p>Vers. 24. <hi>He said vnto him, Destroy not the wisemen, &amp;c.</hi> Whereas if the sentence of
death had beene executed vpon these superstitious Chaldeans, the Church of God should
haue beene deliuered from pestilent enemies, and they beside had iustly deserued to die, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of their fraud, and impostures; it may seeme, that Daniel might haue done much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to haue suffered the sentence to proceede against them.</p>
                        <p>1. For answer hereunto, <hi>Osiander</hi> thinketh, that there might be some innocent men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, which erred onely of simplicitie, and did not malitiously by their wicked arts
oppose themselues against the truth, and therefore Daniel would haue them spared: But it
is euident by the text, that Daniel would generally haue all the wisemen spared, which yet
remained, for some of them had beene slaine alreadie.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Caluin</hi> thinketh the reason was, <hi>quia nondum maturuerat ipsorum iniquitas,</hi> because
yet their iniquitie was not come to the full, they were reserued to a further punishment.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Bullinger</hi> thinketh they were spared, that by Daniels meanes <hi>in vera sapientia profice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,</hi>
they might come to repentance, and profit in true wisedome: these endes indeede the
Lord might propound to himselfe in sparing these hypocrites, but the question is what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

reason mooued Daniel to entreat for them.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Bullinger</hi> againe thinketh, that God stirred vp Daniel to doe it, because he would haue
his iudgements tempered with clemencie: some of them were put to the sword, the rest the
Lord would haue spared, that his mercie and clemencie might appeare in iudgement: This
beeing admitted to haue beene the secret cause before God of this work, yet it is not shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
what stirred vp Daniel to doe it.</p>
                        <p>5. These two reasons then remaine which perswaded Daniel. 1. his charitie and loue
euen toward his enemies, <hi>non vult eos perire propter quos erat ipse periturus,</hi> he would not
haue them perish, for whose cause he was like to haue perished, <hi>Hierome. Lyran.</hi> wherein
he imitateth the clemencie of Christ, who prayed for his enemies: <hi>Pellican.</hi> he might by
this meanes winne them, or els heape coales vpon their head, and make them lesse excuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
2. Daniel in equitie considered <hi>causam non esse iustam,</hi> that the cause was not iust,
which mooued Nebuchadnezzar to command them to be killed: but he did it in hast and
rage, and therefore Daniel not so much looking vnto their persons, as to their cause, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
that they might be spared. <hi>Polan.</hi>

in saying, I haue found a man, &amp;c.</head>
                        <p>1. Some thinke that <hi>Arioch</hi> which knewe that Daniel and his companions were wiser
then the rest of the Chaldeans, had indeede sought them out <hi>ad solutionem faciendam,</hi> to
giue solution of the kings demaund, <hi>Hugo.</hi> but it is euident out of the text, ver. 13. that
they were no otherwayes sought for but to be put to death.</p>
                        <p>2. Most doe thinke that Arioch here played the cunning courtier, <hi>qui sibi vsurpant alio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
inuenta,</hi> which doe take vnto themselues, that which other men finde out: <hi>Bullinger.</hi>
for he had not sought for Daniel, <hi>vltro se obtulerat,</hi> he had offred himselfe of his owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tord,
<hi>Lyran. Dei gratiam ad suam refert diligentiam,</hi> the grace and gift of God he ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth
to his owne diligence: <hi>Pellican. fallebat regem, &amp;c.</hi> he deceiued the king herein, as
though he had found out Daniel, whereas he offred himselfe. <hi>Pintus.</hi> But he could not
without the kings great offence and indignation haue told such a palpable lie, seeing that
Daniel had before presented himselfe to the king, ver. 16. and desired some time, to shewe
the king his dreame. <hi>Polan.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. Therefore to meete with this doubt, <hi>Caluine</hi> thinketh, that Daniel had not confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
before immediately with the king, but <hi>Arioch fuisse internuntium,</hi> that Arioch was
the messenger betweene them, when the king granted him some time: But the text is rather
to be taken according to the letter, vers. 16. <hi>that Daniel</hi> (himselfe) <hi>went, and desired the
king:</hi> for Arioch durst not haue mooued any such thing, hauing strait charge giuen him to
put all the wisemen to death forthwith.</p>

that a man was found out, &amp;c. but the word in the Chalde <hi>hashcacath,</hi> is in the actiue; <hi>I</hi>
                           <pb n="57" facs="tcp:18834:32"/>
haue found: And yet it had not beene true in the other sense, for Daniel was not found, but
offred, and he was not now first knowne, or found, but he had made himselfe knowne to
the king before.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi>Polanus</hi> maketh this therefore to be his meaning: that in this speach, he doth, <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulari
regi, &amp;c.</hi> congratulate with the king, and ascribe as vnto his fortune, that such
a thing had happened: But the phrase it selfe, <hi>I haue found,</hi> sheweth that he doth attribute
somewhat in this matter vnto himselfe.</p>
                        <p>6. Therefore I thinke with <hi>Iunius,</hi> that the meaning of these words, <hi>I haue found a man,</hi>
is nothing els, but <hi>incidi in hominem,</hi> I haue met with the man, not that he first found him
out, but that now he fell vpon him, or he came vnto him to bring him to the king: so is the
word vsed, 1. King 22. 20. where Ahab going downe to take possession of Noboths vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,

                        <p>1. Some thinke he nameth him of Iudah, because he had heard, that diuers excellent
Prophets had beene of that tribe: <hi>Lyran. Pintus.</hi> but that is not like, for the famous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
which liued about that time in the captiuitie, were <hi>Ieremie,</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> who both

                        <p>2. Therefore Gods prouidence rather appeareth herein: that as Daniel was not before in
the assemblie of the wisemen, so now he should not be counted among them: that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of the dreame should onely be acknowledged to proceede from God, and not
be ascribed to the skill and cunning of any wisemen.</p>

                        <p>4. <hi>Bullinger</hi> here obserueth well, in that the Lord refused the great wisemen of Babylon,
who were had in great reputation for their learning and wisedome, and preferreth a poore
captiue, <hi>infirma mundi fortissimis esse robustiora,</hi> that the weake things of the world are

                        <p>1. Daniel reckoneth vp 4. kind of wisemen among the Chaldeans: the first are called
<hi>cachinim,</hi> wisards, which by coniectures and casting of lots did gesse of things to come:
the second <hi>ashphin,</hi> which by the aspect and sight of the starres did make coniecture of

                        <p>2. All these Daniel denieth to be sufficient or able to finde out this secret, and that for

                        <p>It will be obiected on the contrarie, that the heathen often had dreames, whereby they
knewe things to come, and the like oracles they receiued at Delphos: which were not giuen
by God, but vttered by spirits. Hereunto we answer, 1. that many of those oracles were
false, ambiguous, and doubtfull, as those which were giuen to <hi>Craesus,</hi> and <hi>Pirrhus.</hi> 2. many
of them were deuised either by them, who affirmed they had such dreames, or by the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
to win more credit thereby. 3. And if some such dreames and oracles tooke place, either
verie sewe of them did hit, which might be by chance and hap hazzard, as we say, a fewe
onely of a great number falling out: or the deuill by the subtiltie of his nature by some na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall

                        </p>
                        <p>4. And as their dreames were vncertaine, so were they as vncertainely interpreted: as
the dreame which <hi>Darius</hi> had, before he encountred with <hi>Alexander,</hi> some expounded to
signifie the victorie that he should haue against him; some gaue a contrary sense, as <hi>Q. Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
writeth, <hi>lib. 3. Tullie</hi> giueth an other instance, how one going to the Olympike games
had a dreame, that he was turned into an eagle: one wisard interpreted it, that he should
ouercome, because the Eagle is superiour to all other foules: an other turned it the contrary
way, that he should haue the worse, because the eagle driuing other birds before her, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth

as Daniel sheweth, vers. 29.</p>
                        <p>2. Some by the latter dayes, vnderstand the comming of Christ, <hi>extremitas dierum vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catur

the Gospel is as it were the perfection and renewing of all things; <hi>Caluin. Bullinger.</hi> so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so

of water, and such like: or else the affection, thoughts, and passions of the minde in
the day, which cause the like dreames in the night, and these are humane dreames: or the
reuelation of Gods spirit, sometime concurring with mens thoughts, sometime without
them, whence are diuine dreames, of which kind this was: or the illusion of Sathan, which
causeth diabolicall dreames.</p>

2. Now mens thoughts sometimes are the cause of dreames, as the preacher saith, <hi>dreames
come through the multitude of busines,</hi> Eccles. 5. 2. but such dreames then doe not prognosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
things to come, but are a representation onely of things done and past: <hi>Ly.</hi> sometime
they are not the cause, but the occasion onely and preparation of the minde for the dreame
which God purposeth to send; as Iosephs carefull thoughts, what he should doe with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
whom he suspected to be with child, were but forerunners of that direction, which God
gaue him by a dreame, correspondent vnto his former thoughts, Matth. 1. <hi>Pere.</hi> So <hi>Polanus</hi>

there was an higher and mightier then himselfe. 3. Other generall causes there were beside:
that all earthly Potentates should hereby be admonished, how fraile and of what short con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance

(not the Angels, as <hi>Vatab.</hi>) but Daniel and his fellowes, which ioyned in prayer: some read
that the interpretation might be made manifest, as the Latine, whom <hi>Lyranus</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:

                        <head>Quest. 37. vers. 31. Of the vision which the King sawe in
his dreame the manner and parts thereof.</head>
                        <p>First, Daniel rehearseth the kings dreame, what he sawe, and then he giueth the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
thereof, from vers. 36. to ver. 45.</p>
                        <p>The vision consisteth of two parts: of the image which the king sawe in his dreame, to v.
34. and then of the stone, which broke it in peices, ver. 34. 35.</p>
                        <p>The image is described, first by the adiuncts, then by the matter.</p>
                        <p>The adiuncts are fiue, 1. it was but one. 2. it was great. 3. glorious and excellent. 4.
it stoode before him. 5. it was terrible.</p>
                        <p>The matter was either distinct, as the head of gold, the armes and breast of siluer, the
thighs and bellie of brasse, the legges of yron; or else mingled together, as the feete were
part of yron, part of clay.</p>
                        <p>Then followeth the description of the stone, by fixe arguments. 1. of the place, it was
taken out of a mountaine, which though it be not expressed here is supplied, ver. 45. 2.
of the manner, it was cut out without hands. 3. by the effects, it brake the image in pei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
4. by the euent, the image became as nothing, it was as the chaffe, which the winde
carrieth away. 5. by the adiunct, it became a great mountaine. 6. by the effect, it filled
the whole earth.</p>
                        <p>2. This vision representeth two kingdomes; the image the earthly, and the stone the
heauenly: in the earthly 4. things are obserued, 1. the varietie of administration, and
great difference of gouernement in respect of time, and place. 2. the great pompe and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
3. the terrour and tyrannie. 4. the vncertaintie and mutabilitie.</p>
                        <p>In the spirituall kingdome of Christ 4. things are also expressed: 1. the beginning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
from heauen. 2. the administration thereof, not by any humane or worldly meanes.
3. the encrease thereof, through the world. 4. the continuance thereof for euer, when all
other earthly kingdomes and regiments shall be dissolued.</p>

of which kind this image was.</head>
                        <p>The Lord vseth 4. kind of signes to foreshewe and signifie things to come: 1. the first is
of those, which are onely signes, and serue to no other ende, then to shadowe forth things
to come; such were the signes shewed vnto the Prophets in visions, and dreames. 2. There
are signes, which are not onely types and figures of things to come, but serue also to other
purposes; such were the ceremonies of Moses law, which were shadowes of sprituall things,
but had also their present vse, seruing as rites and ceremonies of the lawe. 3. Some signes
did signifie something which was presently done and effected, as <hi>Naamans</hi> washing of
himselfe seuen times, did betoken that he was in that instant cured of his leprosie. 4. Some
figures did not onely shewe a present effect, but did also shadowe forth some more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
worke afterward to be effected, as the blowing of the trumpets of rammes hornes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:18834:34"/>
the walls of Iericho, did not onely assure them of the present subuersion and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of Iericho, but it signified the ouerthrow of idolatrie by the preaching of the Gospel:
so the setting vp of the brasen serpent did not onely giue present health of bodie to them
that looked vpon it, but it did also promise spirituall health of soule to all which with the
eyes of faith should behold Christ: now this vision which <hi>Nabuchadnezzer</hi> saw was of the
first kind: it was a meere signe seruing to no other purpose, then to signifie and shew vnto
the king, what should come to passe afterward. <hi>Perer.</hi>

                        <p>1. Those kingdomes which were alreadie destroyed, as the Assyrian Monarchie, whose

of the world are omitted, as of the Sycionians, Athenians, Lacedemonians, Lydians,
which though they were flourishing kingdomes, and had command ouer the countries next
adioyning, yet they had not such vniuersall dominion, as the great Monarchies of the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans,
Persians, Grecians had. 3. Such Monarchies and kingdomes are here described,
which had some coherence and dependance with and of the other, the ruine of the one, was
the raising of the other: as the Persian Monarchie subdued the Babylonian, the Greekes
the Persian: therefore the great and flourishing kingdomes of the Scythians, Egyptians,
Carthaginians, are exempted, which had not that succession one to another, as the great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies
of the world had. 4. Those great kingdomes are onely here decyphered, which
ruled in the world till Christs comming, who was the stone cut out of the mountaine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hands: therefore the kingdome of the Gothes, and Vandals, Saracens and Turks, which
haue risen vp since Christs beeing in the flesh, are without the compasse of this vision.

Babylonian Empire was <hi>primum temporum ordine,</hi> the first in order of time, as the head in

the people of God, though hard enough, yet it was more equall then the regiment of
the Persians in generall. 5. Beside beeing compared with the rest, it was more golden-like
in respect of their flourishing peace: for after that Nabuchadnezzer had subdued the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
round about, that Monarchicall state enioyed tranquilitie and peace 50. yeares; twentie

Christ. 3. There is a metaphor in the word head, which signifieth the antiquitie and prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of that kingdome, and the knowledge and wisdome of that nation. 4. An other fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
there is, in that he is likened to gold, which betokeneth their riches, prosperitie, and

1. The Scripture doth euidently testifie what large dominions the king of Babel had,
Ierem. 27. 6. <hi>I haue giuen all these lands into the hand of Nabuchadnezzer king of Babel my
seruant, and the beasts of the field haue I also giuen him to serue him, and all nations shall serue

9, 10.</p>
                        <p>2. Forren writers also haue ginen the like testimonie of the greatnes of the Babylonian
Empire: <hi>Berosus,</hi> who wrote of the Chaldean affaires, preferreth him before all kings that
were before him. <hi>Megasthenes lib. 4. de reb. Indicis,</hi> witnesseth, that Nabuchadnezzer beside
the Prouinces of the East, subdued Egypt, Africa, Spaine, and maketh him in courage and
magnanimitie superiour to <hi>Hercules:</hi> so likewise <hi>Strabo lib. 15. Geograph.</hi> writeth, that this
Nabuchadnezzer was the mightiest of all other kings, and held of the Chaldeans to

                           <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith, that his dominion extended from India to Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opia.</p>
                        <p>3. But whereas it is said, that God had made him ruler in all places, this is not so to be
taken strictly according to the letter: for neither Nabuchadnezzer, or any other Monarch
euer had the dominion and rule of the whole world: as witnesseth the altar of Alexander,
the pillars of Hercules, and Ctesiphon the boundes of the Romane Empire toward the East.
1. Some therefore thinke that this is spoken in respect of the opinion of the Chaldeans, who
held him to be an absolute Monarch ouer all the world: 2. or that all, according to the
Scripture, is taken for the most, or many: as Gen. 22. 18. the Lord saith, that all nations
should be blessed in Abraham: that is, many: as c. 17. 5. the Lord saith, <hi>A father of many
nations haue I made thee: Perer.</hi> But this example is vnfitly alleadged, for in the one place
the Lord speaketh of Abrahams carnall generation, in the other of the spirituall benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which in Christ should come indeede vpon all nations. 3. some take it therefore for an

                        <p>It will be here obiected, that the Empire of the Medes was at this time very mightie, as
<hi>Herodotus lib.</hi> 1. maketh mention of the greatnes of Cyaxares king of the Medes, who ruled
ouer all Asia, and subdued the Assyrians, the Babylonians onely excepted. And it is euident
by Herodotus Chronologie, that Cyaxares raigned about this time: for from the beginning
of his raigne vnto the first of Cyrus, he counteth 75. yeares: 40. yeares vnder the raigne of
<hi>Cyaxares,</hi> and 35. vnder <hi>Astyages:</hi> so if the Babylonian captiuitie tooke beginning from the
19. yeare of Nabuchadnezzer, as <hi>Pererius</hi> reckoneth, Cyaxares began his raigne in the 14.
yeare of Nabuchadnezzer: but if the 70. yeares captiuitie be counted from the carrying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
of Iechonias captiue, which is the more probable, which was in the 8. yeare of Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzer,
2. king. 24. 12. then <hi>Cyaxares</hi> beganne his raigne 5. yeares before, about the 3.
yeare of Nabuchadnezzers raigne: they raigned then much about the same time, <hi>Nabuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzer</hi>
in Babylon, and <hi>Cyaxares</hi> among the Medes.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Pererius</hi> giueth this solution, that, the kingdome of the Medes was much wasted by
the other Nabuchadnezzer father vnto this king, who warred against Arphaxad king of the
Medes, and tooke the chiefe citie thereof Ecbatane, as is set forth in the storie of Iudith: and
beside by the incursion and inuasion of the Scythians those parts of Asia were kept vnder the
space of 28. yeares, so that all that time Cyaxares was of no great power, which was during
the raigne of Nabuchadnezzer: then after his death, the Scythians beeing destroied and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled,
<hi>Cyaxares</hi> kingdome flourished for the space of 12. yeares.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. The historie of Iudith could not fall out in the raigne of the Elder Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar:
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:18834:35"/>
for at that time the Apocryphal storie saith, that the Temple had not beene cast
downe, Iudith 5. 18. but the Temple was not destroied till the 19. yeare of this Nabuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzer,
which was about 12. yeares after he had this dreame, which was in the 5. yeare of his
raigne, as is before shewed, Qu. 1. 2. <hi>Cyaxares</hi> could not suruiue Nabuchadnezzer so long,
but it seemeth rather that Nabuchadnezzer suruiued him: for Nabuchadnezzer raigned 45.
yeares: 8. yeares before Iecouias captiuitie, 2. king. 24. 12. and 37. yeares after, 2. king. 25.
27. <hi>Cyaxares</hi> raigned 40. yeares and beganne in the 3. yeare of Nabuchadnezzer, as is proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
before: then his raigne must determine in the 43. yeare of Nabuchadnezzer: therefore
neither of these answers are sufficient.</p>
                        <p>4. The best solution then is this, 1. that <hi>Cyaxares</hi> might be a king of power in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote

                        <p>3. <hi>Pererius</hi> thinketh that the Persian Monarchie is described by two armes; because the

                        <head>44. Quest. v. 39. Why the Persian Monarchie is said to be inferiour
to the Babylonian.</head>
                        <p>The Persian Monarchie was not inferiour in glorie, power, or dominion: for <hi>Assuerus</hi>
king of Persia raigned from India vnto Ethiopia ouer an 127. Prouinces, Est. 1. 1. And <hi>Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophon</hi>
also testifieth, that the Persian Monarchie was so large, that it had for the bounds on
the East, the redde Sea, on the West, Cyprus and Egypt, on the North, Pontus Euxinus, on
the South Ethiopia. And seeing Cyrus ioyned the Empire of Babylon to his owne domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
it could not chuse but be greater.</p>
                        <p>1. Some thinke therefore that it is said to be inferiour, in respect of the continuance, for
the Persian Monarchie exceeded not aboue 240. yeares, whereas the Chaldean and Assyrian
Monarchie from <hi>Ninus</hi> continued a 1500. yeares: <hi>Perer.</hi> But Daniel ascendeth not so high
in this comparison: he saith, <hi>it shall be inferiour to thee,</hi> that is, to thy kingdome, as it now
standeth.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Pererius</hi> hath an other answer, that the Persian Monarchie is said to be inferiour in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the present time, not as it should be afterward: but it is euident that Daniel speaketh
of it, as it should be then, when it should rise vp after the other, that it should then be infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Calvine</hi> vnderstandeth it of the generall corruption of manners, which waxe worse,
that <hi>mundi conditio deterior esset, &amp;c.</hi> that the state of the world should be worse vnder the
second Monarchie: but these Monarchies are compared one with an other, that as siluer is
worse then gold, so the second Monarchie should be inferiour to the other.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Polanus</hi> thinketh that it is said to be inferiour, because the Babylonian regiment, <hi>plus
habuit regiae tranquillitatis,</hi> had more princely rest and tranquillitie: but the Persian state was
full of trouble: for presently after the death of Cyrus, his sonnes <hi>Cambises,</hi> and <hi>Tana<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>5. But I thinke rather with <hi>Iunius,</hi> that it is called inferiour, and siluer-like in respect of
the others golden state, because their gouernment was more tolerable and equall toward
the people of God.</p>

more cruell toward the Iewes.</head>
                        <p>1. Though <hi>Cyrus</hi> first gaue libertie to the people to returne, and afterward <hi>Artaxerxes</hi>
gaue licence to <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> to build the Temple; yet other kings of Persia hindred
the building of the Temple, as <hi>Cambises,</hi> and <hi>Ahassuerus,</hi> who by the fraudulent and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
deuice of <hi>Haman,</hi> would vtterly haue destroied the people of the Iewes: So that this
comparison is not in respect of some one or two particular persons of their kings, but of the
disposition of the whole state, which was harder toward the people of God, then was the
first Monarchie of the Babylonians.</p>
                        <p>2. For <hi>Nabuchadnezzer,</hi> though vnder him the people of God was afflicted and endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
much, yet he shewed them some clemencie and fauour: As first when he besieged Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
in the 3. yeare of Iehoiakim, he made not hauocke of all, but carried away part onely of
the vessels of the Temple, and a few of the noble mens children: And after that for the space
of 19. yeares he suffered the kings of Iudah to haue their kingdome, till he was prouoked by
the vnfaithfulnes of Zedekiah to take reuenge: and yet when he had set the citie and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
on fire, he suffered the people to inhabite the countrey still, to plant vineyards, and till
the ground, and he set ouer them <hi>Gedaliah</hi> a good man, one of their owne countrey. So that
in respect of these heroicall and princely parts in Nabuchadnezzer, the Persian Monarchs
were but as siluer, and farre inferiour vnto him. <hi>Osiand.</hi>

for the great wealth and riches of the Persian Empire: for Cyrus ouercame <hi>Craesus</hi>
the rich king of Lydia, of whome that prouerb was taken vp, <hi>ditior Craeso,</hi> richer then <hi>Crae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.

bowle or standing piece of <hi>Semiramis,</hi> which waighed 15. Egyptian talents, and an Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an

beds feete there was an other closet, wherein there were laid vp 3. hundreth talents of siluer:
beside in the bedchamber, there was, an ouerspreading vine made of gold, beset with preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
stones: the bunches of grapes were also made of most costly pretious stones. <hi>Q. Curtius</hi>

                        <p>2. <hi>Lyranus</hi> thinketh this Monarchie is compared to siluer, <hi>quia multum vacabant sapien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia

                        <p>1. This Monarchie must needs be vnderstood of the kingdome of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great,
who ruinated the <hi>Persian</hi> Monarchie: be therefore succeeding next vnto them, must needes

deceiued, who take this third Monarchie for <hi>Carthage:</hi> for it succeeded not any of the other
Monarchies.</p>
                        <p>2. This third Monarchie is resembled to the bellie and the thighs: 1. because, as the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
is the next to the breast, so this Monarchie succeeded next vnto the Persian. 2. like as the
meate passeth through the bellie, but there staieth not; so <hi>Alexander</hi> got many kingdomes,
but he long enioyed them not: they were quickly after his death diuided among his cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines.
3. This resemblance also fitteth the intemperancie and incontinencie of the
Greeke state, which <hi>Alexander</hi> was not so much touched with, as his captaines that
succeeded him. 4. And further the bellie signifieth gluttonie, excesse, and riot, to the
which <hi>Alexander</hi> was much giuen: for his intemperate drinking of wine, obscured all
his other vertues: he would drinke wine so excessiuely, that he did lie sometime three daies,
till he had slept it out: he also appointed games and prizes for the best drinkers: one <hi>Protar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
for drinking vp foure great measures of wine, called <hi>congij,</hi> which euery one contained
a gallon, and a pint, was rewarded of him with a talent, but within three daies he died of
drunkennes, and so did 41. more. In his drunken fit, at the enticement of his harlot <hi>Thais,</hi>
he commanded the most famous citie of the East, of the Persians called <hi>Persepolis,</hi> to be set
on fire: And at an other time in his drunken moode he killed <hi>Clytus</hi> his faithfull counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
which afterward so grieued him, that his friends could hardly stay him from killing
himselfe: Hereupon this saying was taken vp of <hi>Alexander,</hi> that he was more gentle to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
his enemies in battell, then toward his friends at bankers. Some doe excuse this his
immoderate drinking of wine, by the hote and fierie constitution of his bodie: which is
thought to be the cause of the sweete smell, that came from his bodie: as in hote countries
there are the sweetest smells and perfumes. But the drinking of wine did more inflame him,
beeing hoat by nature: as we see, that for the same cause in hote and burning feuers, Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
forbid the vse of wine, or any hote drinke: therefore this doth nothing excuse his vnsati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

is compared to brasse rather because it was more hard and troublesome not onely to other
nations, whome <hi>Alexander</hi> would neuer suffer to be in rest, insomuch that the Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
reioyced when <hi>Alexander</hi> was dead, as thereby gaining their rest and quietnes; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to the people of God: for first he came against Ierusalem with an hostile and cruell minde,
if the Lord had not staied him by a vision in the night, as he himselfe confessed, when <hi>Iad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dua</hi>
the high Priest met him the next day: and after that he gaue wicked <hi>Samballat</hi> leaue to
build an other Temple in mount <hi>Garizim,</hi> which enterprise Nehemiah by his faithfull en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour
had hindred before, whereof he made <hi>Manasses,</hi> the brother of <hi>Iaddua,</hi> Priest: and
by this meanes, both the state of the Church and Commonwealth was much weakned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Iewes. <hi>Ioseph. lib. 11. c. 8. Alexander</hi> also was himselfe of a restles nature: for when
he had heard, that his father <hi>Philip</hi> had conquered any citie, he would say, that his father left
nothing for him: and when he likewise had heard of the Philosopher <hi>Anaximander,</hi> that
there were many worlds, he wept, because he yet had not conquered one. Thus this Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie
was brasen-like to the rest, because the state of the people of God more declined still,
and waxed worse and worse.</p>

3. His successe in battell was admirable, he neuer encountred any enemie, but he ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
him; neuer besieged citie, but he tooke it: and in 3. battels, one at the flood <hi>Granicus,</hi>
an other at <hi>Issus</hi> in Cilicia, the third at <hi>Arbella,</hi> he ouercame all the power of <hi>Asia, Darius</hi>
hauing in his armie 10. hundreth thousand men, aboue one for tenne.</p>
                        <p>4. As was his successe in battell, so was (as the Gentiles call it) his good fortune for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
or rather his prosperous deliuerance from many daungers: that oftentimes he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
deadly wounds, and yet recouered; was in a manner dead, and yet reuiued: insomuch
that <hi>Curtius</hi> writeth of him, <hi>cum plurimum virtuti debuerit, plus eum fortunae debuisse, &amp;c.</hi>
as he did owe much vnto vertue, so yet he owed more vnto fortune, which of all men liuing
he seemed onely to haue power of: yet <hi>Plutarke</hi> in his two orations, which he made of that
argument, sheweth that more is to be ascribed to <hi>Alexanders</hi> vertue, then to his good
fortune.</p>
                        <p>5. The largenes of his Empire was wonderfull: for he subdued the more noble part of
Europe, Syria,<note place="margin">Lib. 6. c. 16.</note> and Egypt, all Asia, and <hi>India</hi> vnto the riuer Ganges: yea <hi>Plinie</hi> writeth, that
in the vtmost boundes of the Sogdianes he built the citie <hi>Alexandria,</hi> where Hercules, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miramis,
and Cyrus had set vp altars before him, as boundes of the Empire: <hi>Lysippus</hi> the
painter hereupon made the picture of <hi>Alexander</hi> looking vp to heauen, with this posie,
<hi>Iupiter asserui terram mihi, tu assere coelum,</hi> Iupiter I haue taken the earth to my selfe, take

none should take his picture but <hi>Lysippus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>6. Such was his celeritie also, that in the space of 13. yeares he conquered more nations,
then one would haue thought he could haue trauelled ouer in so short a time: <hi>Apelles</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
pictured <hi>Alexander</hi> with a thunderbolt, signifying his great swiftnes and agilitie in

the which he subdued more nations, then by warre, for the very terrour of his name made
many Kingdomes submit themselues vnto him: and at the same time when he died, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
Embassadours from all the Nations of Europe, from France, Spaine, Italie, Sicilie, and
from Africa: for if he had not then died, he had taken order, to prouide him a great navie, to
haue compassed Arabia and Africa, and so to haue surprised Spaine and Italie.</p>
                        <p>8. The acts and monuments of <hi>Alexander</hi> are to be counted among other memorable
things, as first the Cities which he built, which <hi>Plutarke</hi> nameth to haue beene 70. then
he brought the barbarous nations to ciuilitie: he taught the people <hi>Hyrcani</hi> the vse of mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
the <hi>Arachosians</hi> tillage and husbandrie, the <hi>Sogdians</hi> that they should nourish and not
kill their parents: the <hi>Persians</hi> to honour their mothers, and not to vse them for their
wiues: the <hi>Scythians</hi> that they should not eate the dead, but burie them.</p>
                        <p>9. Adde hereunto his singular vertues: his constancie and patience in induring of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
his clemencie toward those whome he conquered: the same day he tooke and resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
againe to the king of <hi>India</hi> his kingdome: <hi>Darius</hi> mother he honourably entertained as
a Queene: his continencie was singular, <hi>Darius</hi> wife, and his most beautifull daughters he
touched not, but preserued their chastitie, neither would he see them. But his liberalitie and
magnificence exceeded his other vertues:<note place="margin">Alexanders vertues.</note> he gaue 23. thousand talents among his souldiers
to pay their debts: he bid to one feast 9. thousand ghests, and gaue vnto euery one a cuppe of
gold: to one that asked a reward of him, he gaue a citie: which he refusing as too great a gift
for him, <hi>Alexander</hi> said; <hi>Non quaero quid to decet accipere, sed quid me decet dare,</hi> I stand
not vpon it, what it is meete for thee to take, but what it is fit I should giue. And to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
this point, <hi>Plutarke</hi> saith, that those vertues for the which seuerally certaine worthie
men haue beene commended, did all concurre in him, as the valour of <hi>Achilles,</hi> the chastitie
of <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> the pietie of <hi>Diomedes,</hi> the courage of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the policie of <hi>Themistocles,</hi> the

he had <hi>Homer</hi> to set forth his praise, so he had diuers excellent writers to register his acts:

                        <head>Quest. 49. vers. 40. Whether this fourth kingdome must

                        <p>There are here two opinions: some take the Romane Empire to be vnderstood by this

fourth kingdome, which is compared to yron, and the same to continue after the comming
of Christ to the ende of the world, as <hi>Lyranus</hi> interpreteth the two legges of the diuision
of the Romane Empire into the Occidentall and Orientall at Constantinople: of the same
opinion are <hi>Rupertius, Hugo Cardinal. Pintus,</hi> and of our writers, <hi>Bullinger, Pellican, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens.
Caluin, Melancthon, Osiand.</hi> Some doe here comprehend the Romane Empire, but
vntill the comming of Christ, as <hi>Pererius in</hi> vers. 32. We will examine their reasons.</p>
                        <p>1. Vers. 28. Daniel saith that the Lord shewed the king what should come to passe
in the latter dayes, therefore all the Monarchies to the ende of the world are here signified.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> The word <hi>acharith</hi> as is before shewed, doth not onely signifie the latter or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
dayes, but the time following, as it is taken, Gen. 49. 1. and the Prophet expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
himselfe, vers. 29. what is meant by the latter dayes, <hi>that which should come to passe
hereafter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. It is not like, that the Lord would conceale this thing from his Prophet, and that
Daniel speaking of three of the Monarchies, should omit the fourth, which was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
of all: neither would the Lord leaue his Church without comfort herein.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. As God reuealed not his whole minde vnto the rest of the Prophets, so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had Daniel a cleare vision of all, which should happen in the world. 2. he toucheth all
these foure kingdomes and gouernments, which should be the chiefe oppressors and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
of his people vntill the rising of Christs kingdome; vntill which time they had not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured
much at the Romanes hands, but by their owne procurement: Daniel therefore spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of those kingdomes onely, which medled most with the people of God then; it much
belonged not to their present comfort to heare of those kingdomes which should come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward.</p>
                        <p>3. Daniel prophesieth of the kingdome of Christ, which should still encrease vnto the
ende of the world, vers. 44. And cap. 12. 2. he euidently speaketh of euerlasting life, and
of the resurrection.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. The Prophet doth but touch that by occasion in a word, to shewe the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and consummation of Christs kingdome: it followeth not, that therefore he should
describe all the Monarchies to the ende of the world.</p>
                        <p>4. But the euent of things answering to this prophesie, sheweth that it is most fitly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
to the Romane Empire.</p>
                        <p>1. Because as yron the Romane Empire subdued all other kingdomes: for whereas <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi>
kingdome was diuided into foure, <hi>Prolome</hi> had Egypt, <hi>Seleucus</hi> Syria, <hi>Antigonus</hi>
Asia the lesse, and <hi>Antipater</hi> Macedonia, who also obtained <hi>Antigonus</hi> regiment; all these
foure dominions were dissolued and dissipated by the Romanes. <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> ouercame
<hi>Perseus</hi> king of Macedonia, and led him with his two sonnes, <hi>Philippui,</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> in
triumph: <hi>Lucullus</hi> and <hi>Pompeius</hi> subdued <hi>Mithridates</hi> and <hi>Tygranes,</hi> and brought vnder
the Syrian kingdome: and <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> ouercame <hi>Antonie</hi> with <hi>Cleopatra</hi> his wife, and
made a Prouince of Egypt: And all the East countries <hi>Pompey</hi> the great subdued, and
ioyned to the Romane Empire, as <hi>Asia, Pontus, Armenia, Paphlagonia, Cappadocia, Cilicia,
Syria,</hi> with others, waging battell with them 30. yeares together, hauing slaine, put to

exercise of warlike feates, and good discipline and gouernement.</p>
                        <p>2. The <hi>two legges</hi> doe signifie the diuersitie of gouernement, which was euidently seene
in the Romane common wealth: first, they were gouerned by Kings, then by Consuls, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
by Tribunes, they had their <hi>decemviri,</hi> their Dictators for a time, then they came to
their <hi>triumviri,</hi> when three did beare the greatest sway; as <hi>Augustus, Antonie, Lepidus:</hi>
and then the gouernement fell to <hi>dunmviri,</hi> into the hands of two, <hi>Augustus,</hi> and <hi>Antonie,</hi>
and at the last one had the Soueraigntie, and so it continued vnder one Emperour, vntill
<hi>Marcus Antonius Verus,</hi> then there began to be associates, and diuers Emperours at once.

                        </p>
                        <p>3. The feete partly of yron, partly of clay, signifie the diuision and dissention of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
which is manifest in the Romane gouernment: for there were foure notable diuisions
among them: first betweene the Senatours, and <hi>ordinem Equestrem,</hi> the gentrie of Rome,
concerning the authoritie and power in matters of iudgement: there was also <hi>bellum sociale,</hi>
                           <pb n="68" facs="tcp:18834:38"/>
the <hi>sociall warre,</hi> or of confederates, whereof <hi>Drusus</hi> was the author; and <hi>bellum seruile,</hi>
whereof <hi>Seriorius</hi> was the beginner: then followed the most deadly ciuill warres betweene
<hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Marius, Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> betweene <hi>Octavius</hi> with <hi>Mar. Antonius,</hi> and <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
and <hi>Cassius,</hi> and betweene <hi>Octavius</hi> and <hi>Antonie.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. Whereas the feete were partly of yron, partly of clay, which is expounded to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
that the kingdome should be partly strong and partly broken: this also is thus applyed to
the Romane state: because they were sometimes conquerers, sometime they were conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
As the French brake in to the verie Capitall: <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> king of Epyrus did afflict the
Romanes with fierce warre, and ouercame them at <hi>Trebia,</hi> and <hi>Trasimenum: Hannibal</hi>
made a great slaughter of them at <hi>Cannas: Crassus</hi> was ouercome of the Parthians, and
the Romane ensignes taken: <hi>Bullinger.</hi> Some vnderstand the yron and clay feete, of the
kingdomes, which did spring out of the Romane Empire, as of <hi>France, Spaine, Germanie,</hi>
the <hi>Turkes,</hi> whereof some were more victiorious, warlike, and yron-like then others: <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon.</hi>
Some apply it to the Emperours of Rome, whereof some were valiant, some
cowardly and slouthfull. <hi>Osian.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>5. Whereas the mingling and tempering of the yron and clay together is expounded
of their mariages; they shewe likewise how this was accomplished and fulfilled in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Empire: for <hi>Pompey</hi> tooke to wife <hi>Iulia</hi> daughter to <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> and <hi>Antonie</hi> marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Octauia Augustus Caesars</hi> sister, whom he did afterward repudiate, and married <hi>Cleopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra</hi>
Queene of Egypt: so that those coniunctions did not hold: <hi>Bullinger. Pere. Pin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. True it is, that the Romanes did subdue vnto their Empire all other nations
of any fame or power: but it is not so much to be considered, how they were yron-like to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
other nations, but how they were affected towards the people of God, toward the
comming of the Messiah: But vntill then the Iewes had not felt such hard seruice vnder the
Romanes, as they had vnder other cruell Lords: for the innouations which were made in
the Iewish state by <hi>Crassus</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> were done rather by the consent of the Iewes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and their kings striuing about the kingdome, then by conquest: and the interest that
<hi>Antonie</hi> had there, was by the right and title of the <hi>Ptolomies,</hi> whose daughter and heyre
<hi>Cleopatra</hi> he married: But of all other the <hi>Syrian</hi> tyrannie vnder <hi>Antiochus</hi> was most cruell
and yronlike towards the Iewes, and therefore to that state this description rather agreeth,
as shall afterward be shewed.</p>
                        <p>2. The diuision of the kingdome, signified by the two legges, cannot be vnderstood of
the diuerse regiments and gouernements, one succeeding another: for it was still the same
kingdome; and beeing the same, it cannot be said to be diuided into two diuerse parts, as
the legges are perpetually diuided, and are not ioyned together againe.</p>
                        <p>3. And for the same reason the diuision of the kingdome cannot be vnderstood of the
Ciuill and domesticall dissentions: for there was a reuniting of it againe, after these sturres
and tumults were appeased, but these kingdomes here spoken of, as two legges, were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
and kept a sunder still.</p>
                        <p>4. The yron and clay signified, that the kingdome should be partly strong and partly
weake: but this respect of their strength and weakenesse must not haue reference to other
forren nations, but to the people of God, for whose comfort, this propheticall vision was
sent: But toward the Iewes the Romane state was not partly strong, partly weake, vntill the
comming of Christ; that sometime the one had the better, sometime the other: But thus
the case stood betweene them, and the Seleucians in Syria, and Ptolomies in Egypt, that
sometime they preuailed against the people of God; sometime God gaue them victorie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their enemies, as is euident in the storie of the <hi>Macchabees.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>5. The coniunctions in marriage must be of diuerse kings betweene themselues after the
diuision of the kingdome, not of the same kingdome within it selfe: and therefore that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of the mutuall mariages betweene <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pompey, Octauian</hi> and <hi>Antonie,</hi>
can here haue no place: for it is euident, vers. 44. that diuerse kings, and at the same instant,
are vnderstood, who ioyned in mariage.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Reasons shewing that the Romane Empire cannot
be here vnderstood.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. In the ende of this fourth yronlike Monarchie the Messiah should come, and his
kingdome be set vp; but Christ came not in the ende, but in the beginning of the Romane
Monarchie. <hi>Polan.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="69" facs="tcp:18834:38"/>
2. At the comming of the Messiah all these kingdomes must be dissolued, and broken in
peices, vers. 44. Now the Romane Empire ended not at Christs comming: But it will be
answered, that Daniel speaketh of the second comming of Christ, when all these kingdomes
should be destroyed. <hi>Contra.</hi> That cannot be, for after the dissolution of these kingdomes,
that stone which dashed them in peices, shall growe into a mountaine, and fill all the earth,
ver. 35. which cannot be otherwise vnderstood, then of the propagation of Christs king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
which must be before his second comming.</p>
                        <p>3. This kingdome here spoken of was diuided into two, signified by the two legges:
but the Romane Empire continued one vntill the time of Constantine, after whom it was
diuided among his three sonnes, bot into two, but three parts.</p>
                        <p>4. They cannot shew in the Romane state, such coniunction in mariage betweene di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse
kings, and kingdomes: but they of whom they giue instance for such matrimonill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunctions,
were of one and the same kingdome.</p>
                        <p>5. That fourth kingdome must continue vntill the comming of Christ; but if they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
this prophesie of Christs second comming, the Romane Empire hath beene dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
long since.</p>
                        <p>6. These kingdomes were one to succeede another, and to possesse the others domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
the <hi>Persian</hi> obtayned all, that was vnder Babylon, Alexander gained all, which the
Persian had: but the Romanes had onely Syria and Egypt of the Babylonian Empire, and
onely <hi>Asia minor</hi> of the Persian Monarchie, whereas there were vnder the Persians an 127
prouinces from India to Aethiopia, Ester 1. therefore this last ktngdome cannot be the
Romane state, for it must make one bodie with the rest, as in the image of a mans bodie is
represented. <hi>Polanus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>7. In this vision the speciall intention of the Prophet is to describe such kingdomes, as
were aduersaries to the Iewes, and pressed them most, but the Iewes endured not much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
vnder the Romanes till the comming of Christ: they endured more vnder the kings
of Syria, and Egypt, especially the first, as is euident in the bookes of the Machabees: that
kingdome which was most cruell and yron-like toward the Iewes is here vnderstood: but so
was not the Romane Empire; therefore that is not here comprehended: <hi>Iun. annot.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Pappus</hi> answereth, 1. that it is false, <hi>Iudaici tantum populi conditionem hac visione descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi,</hi>
that the condition onely of the people of the Iewes is described in this vision. 2. he saith
it is likewise false, <hi>à Romanis Iudaeos nihil passos,</hi> that the Iewes suffered nothing at the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes
hands.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. But seeing that the ende and vse of this prophesie, was for the comfort of
Gods people; it must needs follow, that such alterations and changes of kingdomes are here
described, which most nearely concerned the people of God: thus then we may reason,
The end of these prophesies, as also of all Scripture, is for the comfort of Gods people, Rom.
15. 3. but the prophesie of such things, as concerned not the people of God, was not
for their vse and comfort; therefore such prophesies are not contained here.</p>
                        <p>2. It is not affirmed, that the Iewes endured nothing of the Romanes, but that their
gouernement was nothing so hard and yron-like as was the tyrrannie of the kings of
Syria.</p>
                        <p>8. The vision of an humane image signified one vnited bodie, consisting of diuerse king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
one succeding another, as the parts of the bodie doe one ioyne vnto another; the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
and head of which bodie was in Babylon: but the Romane Monarchie beeing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
at the least a 1200. miles from Babylon, could not make one vnited bodie with it:
therefore that Monarchie cannot here fitly be vnderstood. <hi>Polan.</hi>

                        <head>Quest. 50. That this fourth Monarchie diuided into two kingdomes,
resembled by the two legges of the image, was
the kingdome of Syria and
Egypt.</head>
                        <p>When <hi>Alexander</hi> was dead, which happened in the 33. yeare of his age, his kingdome
was diuided into foure parts: <hi>Seleucus</hi> had Babylon and Syria, <hi>Ptolome</hi> Egypt, <hi>Cassander</hi>
Macedonia, and <hi>Antigonus</hi> held Asia: but the two first were the mightiest kingdomes, and
did most afflict the people of God, which are here shadowed forth by the two yron legges;
as thus may be shewed.</p>
                        <p>1. The occasion of Nebuchadnezzars dreame is an argument thereof, which was to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:18834:39"/>
knowe, what should become of his kingdome after him; the greatest part whereof fell vnto
the share of these two, <hi>Seleucus</hi> that obtained the kingdom of Syria, and <hi>Ptolome</hi> of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. The scope and ende of this vision, was to describe vnto the Iewes their state and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
vnder these kingdomes vntill the comming of the Messiah: which was most hard and
yron-like vnder the tyrannicall command of these two houses, the Seleucians, and the Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomies:
so the captiuitie and bondage of the Israelites in Egypt is compared to an yron for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace,
Deut. 4. 20. and now vnder Egypt againe they endure an other yron fornace.</p>
                        <p>3. This vision is opened and expounded by other visions, and prophesies afterward, cap.
7. 8. but most euidently, cap. 11. 4. where the kingdome of Alexander is foretold shall be
diuided into 4. parts, and that among the rest the king of the North, which is Babylon and
Syria, and the king of the South, namely of Egypt, shall be the chiefe: But the Romanes
could neither be this king of the South, nor of the North.</p>
                        <p>4. The euent in these two kingdomes answereth to the prophesie: for here 4. things
are foreshewed. 1. the condition and manner of gouernment towards the people of God,
which should be yron-like, ver. 40. and so indeede were the kings of the North and South
hard as yron, and cruell towards the people of God.</p>
                        <p>2. The constitution of these kingdomes is set forth, vers. 42. which as two legges did
issue forth of the brasen bellie and thighs, that is Alexanders Monarchie, the strength where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
remained in them.</p>
                        <p>3. Then the inconstant and variable state of these two kingdomes is described, they
should be part of yron, part of clay: sometime one should be the stronger, sometime the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
as <hi>Ptolomeus Euergites,</hi> had the better against <hi>Seleucus Callinicus,</hi> and <hi>Ptolomie Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphus</hi>
to reuenge his daughter <hi>Berenice</hi> her death, against <hi>Antiochus Megas:</hi> but for the
most part the king of the North was the stronger.</p>
                        <p>4. The matrimoniall league betweene these kingdomes is also foreshewed, which yet
should not hold: <hi>Ptolome Philadelphus,</hi> gaue his daughter to <hi>Antiochus Theos</hi> to make
perfect agreement betweene them: but this bond could not hold: for <hi>Antiochus</hi> had a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
wife, <hi>Laodicea,</hi> who caused <hi>Berenice</hi> to be poysoned, whereupon ensued great warres
betweene these two kings: likewise <hi>Antiochus</hi> surnamed the great, gaue his daughter <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra</hi>
to <hi>Ptolome Epiphanes:</hi> and thus euerie part of this prophesie was truely fulfilled in
these two kingdomes, as shall be shewed more at large, in the opening of the 11. chap.
<hi>Iunius.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>5. The prophesie of Ezekiel against Gog, cap. 38. herein concurreth with this vision;
which is there ver. 15. expounded to be the kingdome of the North: that vsed the helpe of
the <hi>Persians,</hi> who were tributarie vnto Antiochus Epiphanes: 1. Mac. 3. 31. and of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabians,
ver. 5. against the people of God.</p>
                        <p>6. It is well obserued by some learned men, that the Romanes are but thrice mentioned
in all the prophesie of Daniel, once, cap. 11. 18. where it is said, <hi>a Prince shall cause his
shame:</hi> the Romanes sent their Consul against <hi>Antiochus Megas:</hi> againe in the same chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
vers 30. <hi>the shippes of Cittim shall come against him:</hi> the Romanes sent <hi>Popilius</hi> to stay
<hi>Antiochus Epimanes,</hi> and chap. 9. 26. where it is said, <hi>the people of the prince which shall
come, and destroy the citie,</hi> the Romanes are vnderstood. In other places of his prophesie
no mention is made of them: this prophesie then is not extended vnto them.</p>
                        <p>But it will be thus obiected on the contrarie, that this last Monarchie cannot be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
of these two kingdomes of Syria and Egypt.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi>Obiect.</hi> It is said, that in the dayes of these kings, the kingdome of the Messiah
should be set vp: but these kingdomes were destroyed and dissolued by the Romanes before
the Messiah came: <hi>Pappus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> The kingdome indeede of Syria was before subdued by Pompey, and the house
of the <hi>Seleucians</hi> was then extinguished, which might be about 70. or 80. yeares, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about
before the birth of Christ: but the kingdome of Egypt continued still vntill the
raigne of Herod, (vnder whom Christ was borne) who was confirmed in his kingdome by
<hi>Antonie</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra</hi> the daughter of the last <hi>Ptolomie</hi> surnamed <hi>Piper:</hi> so that Egypt
had some part of the Images toe vntill the Lords birth.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Obiect.</hi> This last Monarchie is called a kingdome, it was then but one, but these
were two kingdomes, one of the South, the other of the North: they therefore cannot be
vnderstood to be the fourth Monarchie.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="71" facs="tcp:18834:39"/>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. It is called one kingdome in two respects. 1. because they both issued out
of the kingdome of Alexander, which after his death was diuided: as also because one of
these two kindomes was of greater strength, and had the chiefe superioritie, which was the
kingdome of the North. 2. it is euident in the text that diuerse states and regiments are
comprehended in this fourth Monarchie: for it is said, ver. 43. in the plurall number, <hi>they
shall mingle themselues with the scede of men:</hi> and they are said to be <hi>Kings,</hi> ver. 44. <hi>in the
dayes of these kings, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Obiect. Alexanders</hi> kingdome was diuided into 4. parts, as is before shewed: but
here by the two legges two kingdomes onely are signified.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Though <hi>Alexanders</hi> kingdome were diuided among his foure chiefe cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
<hi>Cassander, Antigonus, Seleucus, Ptolome,</hi> yet soone after <hi>Seleucus</hi> vanquished and
killed <hi>Antigonus,</hi> and <hi>Cassander</hi> of Macedonia was not of like power vnto the rest. 2.
wherefore these two kingdomes are onely spoken of, as the mightiest, and because they two
onely had to doe with the people of God, oppressing them continually, and keeping them
vnder.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Obiect.</hi> The Empire of the Romanes is held of all to be the fourth Monarchie of
the world, and the most flourishing: This image therefore representing the foure great
Monarchies of the world, is to be extended to the Romane state.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> It is not denied, but that the Romane dominion maketh the fourth generall Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie
of the world: yet this remaineth to be prooued, that in this vision, the generall
state and condition of the world is described: the argument therefore followeth not, Foure
principall kingdomes and Monarchies are set fourth in this vision: therefore the Romane is
one of them: for onely these kingdomes are here described, which then had to deale with
the people of God, and which did beare sway vntill the comming of Christ, and then deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined:
<hi>Iun. annotat.</hi> But seeing we are fallen to make mention of these 4. generall Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies;
it shall not be amisse briefly to shewe the beginning and continuance of them.</p>

generall Monarchies of the world.</head>
                        <p>1. The Babylonian Empire, which is made one with the Assyrian, tooke beginning from
<hi>Ninus,</hi> of whom the citie <hi>Niniue</hi> is thought to haue beene so called, and it continued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue,
a 1000. yeares: yet it neuer flourished more then vnder Nebuchadnezzar the great;
who subdued vnto his kingdome, all <hi>Syria, Phoenice, Iudea, Idumea, Egypt, Lybia,</hi> with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
countries: And this his large dominion began in the first yeare of his raigne, when he
besieged Ierusalem, but it was not at the height till the 23. yeare of his raigne, in the 38.
<hi>Olympiad.</hi> and so it held 60. yeares vnto the raigne of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> which was in the 55. <hi>Olymp.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Persian Monarchie beginning in <hi>Cyrus,</hi> flourished about 230. yeares, as <hi>Pere.</hi> 228.
as <hi>Bullinger,</hi> and was dissolued by <hi>Alexander</hi> in the 112. <hi>Olympiad.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. The Grecian Empire was first founded by <hi>Alexander,</hi> who held the same 6. yeares,
then it was diuided into foure kingdomes, which were soone turned to three: the <hi>Syrian</hi>
kingdome, whereunto was annexed also all <hi>Asia Minor,</hi> which <hi>Seleucus</hi> possessed, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in that house vnto <hi>Olympiad</hi> 175. and afterward was held by <hi>Tygranes</hi> king of <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
12. yeares, and then in the 179. <hi>Olympiad,</hi> was by <hi>Pompey</hi> subdued to the Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.
The second kingdome, which was of Macedonia, in the 150. <hi>Olympiad,</hi> was made sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to Rome, with <hi>Perseus</hi> the last king thereof. The third kingdome of Egypt held out vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

ouercome of Augustus Caesar.</p>
                        <p>4. The Romane kingdome simply beganne from the building of Rome in the 7. <hi>Olym.</hi>
but it was not an absolute Monarchie vntill the 44. <hi>Olympi.</hi> after the ende of the second
<hi>Punike warre:</hi> for then all <hi>Italy, Spaine, Sardinia, Sicilia,</hi> and <hi>Carthage,</hi> were brought vnder

                        <p>1. <hi>Vatablus</hi> vnderstandeth it of the diuerse nations and people which should be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

cum Regibus,</hi> should ioyne in affinitie with other kings: but the text sheweth, that
the kings of this fourth Monarchie should be ioyned in mariage among themselues.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Pappus</hi> with others interpret it of the affinitie betweene <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<hi>Iulia Caesars</hi> daughter: and when she was dead he would haue giuen him in mariage
<hi>Octauia</hi> his sisters daughter: and desired also to haue maried <hi>Pompeys</hi> daughter: so Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus

state, to combine and linke themselues together by mutuall mariages: But this matrimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
coniunction here spoken of, is between diuerse kings; not in the same slate and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>

doth signifie a league and coniunction by mariage.</p>
                        <p>5. Some referre it to herod, who beeing a stranger, would haue maried one of the
Macchabees daughter, that his sonne might peaceably enioy the kingdome: but the maide
killed her selfe for griefe, and he is said to haue abused her beeing dead: <hi>ex Lyran.</hi> But the

it seemeth also that <hi>Iosephus</hi> had some such conceit: for when he commeth to make
mention of this stone, he forbeareth to giue any interpretion of it, putting off the matter
thus; <hi>mihi hoc narrare non libuit, cui propositum est non futura, sed praeterita scribere, &amp;c.
Daniel also giueth an interpretation of the stone: but it liked me not to declare it, whose pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
is to write of things past, not of things to come.</hi> It seemeth he was loath to offend the
Romanes, of whom he had receiued so great grace and fauour, which he should haue done,

it is euident to all the world, they beeing now a dispersed nation, without either king or
priest, Church or commonwealth: And our Blessed Sauiour hath assured vs, that his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

their hereticall fansie is confuted by the verie words of this text: for the kingdome here
spoken of shall stand for euer: it shall not then onely continue for a 1000. yeares.</p>
                        <p>3. Wherefore this Scripture euidently describeth the spirituall kingdome of Christ, in
this world ruling and gouerning the hearts of his seruants by his grace, and propagating his

                        <head>Quest. 54. Whether the stone cut out of the mountaine,
doe signifie Christ or his kingdome.</head>
                        <p>1. The most doe vnderstand this of Christ himselfe, who is signified by this stone, of
which opinion are of the ancient writers, <hi>Iustinus Martyr, dialog. cum Tryphone: Ireneus lib.
3. aduers. haeres. cap. 28. Cyprian, lib. 2. aduers. Iudaeos, sect.</hi> 17. and sometime <hi>Augustine
enarrat. in Psal.</hi> 98. and so interpreteth <hi>Lyranus:</hi> and of the newe writers, <hi>Bullinger</hi> by
this stone would haue Christ vnderstood: as Psal. 118. 22. <hi>the stone which the builders refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
is become the head stone of the corner:</hi> and Isay 28. 16. <hi>Behold I will lay in Sion a stone,
a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation:</hi> to the same purpose <hi>Melancthon:</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<hi>Perorius</hi> beside these testimonies of Scripture, sheweth how Christ this precious stone
was prefigured by certaine typicall stones in the old Testament: as by the stone Iacob pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
and annointed it with oyle: and the rocke which Moses smote with the tod, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
gushed out: by the stone that bare vp Moses hands, Ezod. 17. and by that rocke where
Moses was set when he saw the Lords backe parts, Exod. 33. Further in these fower respects
Christ is compared to a stone. 1. for the continuance. 2. for the strength, he is the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
stone. 3. a rocke of refuge vnto them that beleeue. 4. and a rocke of offence for the
wicked to stumble at.</p>
                        <p>2. Some doe by this stone vnderstand the kingdome and Church of Christ: as <hi>Augustine</hi>
in Psal. 42. and 44. so also Caluine, <hi>comparat regnum Christi cum omnibus illis Monarchijs,
&amp;c.</hi> he compareth the kingdome of Christ, with all those Monarchies, &amp;c. so is the Church
of God likened to a stone, Zach. 12. 3. <hi>in that day I will make Ierusalem an heauie stone for
all people, all that lift it vp shall be torne, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. But these interpretations are not contrarie one to another; they may well stand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
for Christ is not here considered apart by himselfe, but together with his Church, he
as the head, and the other as his bodie; So the Apostle sometime by Christ vnderstandeth the
whole mysticall bodie consisting of Christ and his Church, as 1. Cor. 12. 12. <hi>As the bodie is
one, and hath many members, so is Christ:</hi> so the Church is called <hi>the bodie and fulnesse of

Empire is not comprehended in this vision, as is before shewed at large. quest. 49.</p>
                        <p>2. Some thinke, that this prophesie agreeth vnto the first comming of Christ, <hi>inchoate
&amp; aliquatenus,</hi> in some sort and by way of beginning, and that in the ende, it should dash in
peices the Romane Empire: but it shall most fully and absolutely be accomplished at Christs

                        <p>3. But it shall appeare by these arguments, that this Scripture must onely be referred to
the first comming of Christ, and not at all to the second, but onely by way of analogie,
and by a consequent.</p>
                        <p>1. This <hi>kingdome</hi> shall be set vp in the times of these Kings: but in the euerlasting king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

                        <p>2. This stone was but small at the beginning, but afterward it grew into a mountaine:
but Christ, when he commeth in his glorie, shall then shew himselfe in his greatnes: he shall
not be as a small stone.</p>
                        <p>3. And this stone became a great mountaine, and filled the whole earth: which sheweth,
that Christs kingdome here spoken of, should increase by little and little: but after his second
comming, it shall be at the full, not still encreasing: therefore the kingdome of Christ here in
this world of necessitie must be here described.</p>
                        <p>4. Yet by way of analogicall collection, this prophesie may be applyed vnto Christs se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

of Christ.</head>
                        <p>Vers. 44. <hi>The God of heauen shall set vp a kingdome. Caluin</hi> here setteth downe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
reasons, out of the Rabbine Barbinel whereby he would prooue, that this kingdome
cannot be referred to Iesus the sonne of Mary: his reasons are these six in all.</p>
                        <p>1. Seeing these foure kingdomes here described are terrene and visible, the fift also
which should destroy the other must be also visible, for vnlike things cannot be compared
together.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. It is not necessarie, that all things should be like in a comparison: nay here is
rather an opposition betweene the 4. kingdomes, and this fifth, then a comparison, and in
that it is to destroy the rest, it must be vnlike vnto the rest: the Rabbines argument therefore
followeth not; The fift kingdome shall destroy the former foure, <hi>Ergo</hi> it shall be of the same
kind with the rest: the contrarie is better inferred, that therefore it shall be vnlike vnto the
rest.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Ar.</hi> If religion made a difference between these kingdomes, then were they not foure
but one: for all of them were giuen to idolatrie, and so followed the same superstition.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. It is necessarie that the 5. kingdome, which should abolish all the rest,
should differ in the truth and sinceritie of religion from them: but it is not necessarie, that
the foure Monarchies one destroying and confounding another, should be of diuerse religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
for kingdomes that are of the same superstition, may be one enemie vnto another, as
one error may be contrary to another.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Argum.</hi> It is said of this kingdome, that it shall not be giuen vnto an other: but the
Turke now possesseth a great part of the kingdome of Christians: And among themselues
also religion is diuided, and many distast the Gospel; therefore this cannot be vnderstood of
the kingdome of Christianitie.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. By this kingdome, which God should raise vp, is not vnderstood any visible
or externall kingdome: though the Turke haue surprised the terrene kingdomes and nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which sometime the Christians possessed, yet the spirituall kingdome of Christ is not
resigned vnto them, nor to any other. 2. Euen among Christians there may be diuisions,
and many carnall men may liue in the Church, but they belong not to the spirituall king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Christ, though they remaine in the externall societie of the visible Church.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Argu.</hi> If this be the kingdome of Christ, who was borne vnder <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi>
when the Romane Monarchie in a manner beganne, then the fourth Monarchie, and this
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:18834:41"/>
fifth kingdome should beginne together, which cannot be, for the one must be the ruine and
destruction of the other.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. To this <hi>Caluin</hi> answereth, that the Monarchie of the Romanes beganne not
with the Caesars, but long before, when the Macedonian kingdome was dissolued.</p>
                        <p>2. But this is an vnsufficient answer: 1. because it was no Monarchie, till the time of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
Caesar: but the gouernment before that was sometime <hi>Democraticall,</hi> &amp; popular, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
<hi>Aristocraticall,</hi> gouerned by Consuls: therefore till it became a Monarchie, it could
not be the fourth kingdome here spoken of. 2. Though the fift kingdome and the fourth
beganne not together, yet the same inconuenience followeth, if they continue together: for
the fift kingdome, when it commeth must be the ruine of the other: this argument therefore
of the Rabbine is inuincible against their opinion, which make the Romane Monarchie this
fourth kingdome.</p>
                        <p>3. Therefore to the Rabbines argument we make this further answer, that this fourth
kingdome diuided into two, as consisting of two legges, was the Monarchicall state of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria
and Babylon where the sonnes and ofspring of <hi>Seleucu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </hi> raigned, and of Egypt, where
the <hi>Ptolomies</hi> succeeded one another, as is before shewed, quest. 50. And so indeed this fift
kingdome was the ende of the other.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi>Argum.</hi> The fourth kingdome and the fift can not stand together, the one beeing the
ruine of the other: but vnder <hi>Constantine</hi> and other Christian Emperours of the Romane
state, the Gospel of Christ flourished; therefore it cannot be meant of that kingdome.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra. 1. Caluin</hi> here answereth, that the kingdome of Christ, <hi>non debet referri ad
tempus natiuitatis,</hi> must not be referred to the time of his natiuitle, but to the preaching of
the Gospell: and when the gospell beganne to be published, then the Romane Empire
after <hi>Traianus</hi> time was translated to strangers, to heardmen, and swineards, and beastly
monsters.</p>
                        <p>2. This answer is likewise insufficient: 1. for as soone as Christ was borne, his kingdome
beganne in the dayes of his flesh: as the Angel in the annuntiation of Christs birth to the
virgine Marie, telleth her, <hi>that God would giue him the throne of his father Dauid,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Luk. c. 32. 33.</note> 
                           <hi>and he
shall raigne ouer the house of Iacob, &amp;c.</hi> 2. the gospel was neuer more published in the world,
then in the Apostles time, while yet the Romane Empire continued in the name and stocke
of the Caesars. 3. though the Empire was deuolued to strangers, not of Caesars familie, yet
was it still the Latine and Romane Empire, and therefore was the same Monarchie.</p>
                        <p>3. Wherefore vnlesse the Romane Monarchie be disclaimed here from beeing this fourth
kingdome, this argument cannot be answered, for the fourth kingdome, and the fift cannot
stand together.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi>Argum.</hi> The Romane Empire yet in some sort continueth, therefore this fift is not
the kingdome of Christ, which must not be raised vntill the other be destroyed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> The Romane Monarchie is long since dissolued, and there remaineth nothing
but an image and shadowe thereof, therefore this reason concludeth not.</p>

spirituall, no temporall kingdome.</head>
                        <p>1. Some thinke that Christ was the temporall king of the Iewes, and that the kingdome
of Dauid descended lineally vnto him by right of inheritance; which they would further
confirme by that prophesie of Iaacob. Gen. 49. 10. <hi>the scepter shall not depart from Iudah,
till Shilob come, &amp;c.</hi> whence they inferre, that the kingdome of Israel shall be restored by
the Messiah.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. It can not be shewed, that Christ descended by such a right line, as that the
kingdome came vnto him by lineall descent: for the line which Matthew and Luke set
downe, are of Ioseph, not of Marie, which sheweth that they were both of the same tribe:
but that lineall descent wil deriue the temporall kingdome rather to Ioseph then to Marie.
2. The contrarie rather is inferred vpon that prophesie, that the scepter should then, and not
before depart from Iudah, when the Messiah should come: and he saith not, that he should
be <hi>expectatio Iudaeorum,</hi> the expectation of the Iewes, but the expectation of the Gentiles,
as the Latine translator readeth: or the people or nations (not the Iewes) <hi>should be gathered
vnto him: Pintus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. Now that Christs shall be no temporall, but a spirituall kingdome, neither that he
had any temporall kingdome by succession from Dauid, it may thus appeare,</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="76" facs="tcp:18834:42"/>
1. Iehoiachin the last king of the Iewes beside Zedekiah, whose sonnes were killed
before his face, had none of his seede to sit vpon the throne after him, Ieremie, 22. 30. but
if the kingdome of Christ were lineally deriued from Dauid, it must be counted from
him.</p>
                        <p>2. Christ refused to be made a king, and when he perceiued the people had such an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
he conuaied himselfe from among them, Ioh. 6. 15. he likewise refused to entermeddle
with the office of a king, as to be a iudge in ciuill causes, Luk. 12. 14.</p>
                        <p>3. No temporall kingdome is eternall, but the kingdome of Christ is eternall, therefore
it is no temporall kingdome.</p>
                        <p>4. What manner of kingdome Christs is, the Prophet Zacharie sheweth, <hi>Behold thy

where is the pompe, riches, and glorie of his kingdome?</p>
                        <p>5. As Christs kingdome is, so was the oyle wherewith he was annointed, and the sword
wherewith he was girded: but he was annointed with spirituall oyle, and the sword of his

                           <hi>Contra.</hi> But that these times can not be vnderstood of the Romane Empire at all, hence
it is euident; because this 5. kingdome must be raised vp in the ende of the other: Now

the fourth kingdome here spoken of: See other arguments against this opinion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
49.</p>
                        <p>3. The Iewes do vnderstand this fourth kingdome of the Turkish dominion, &amp; they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
the Macedonian and Romane Empire together, making them both one, because they
say the Romanes had their originall from the Grecians: and this is their deuise, that they
should not be forced to finde the beginning of Christs kingdome vnder the fourth Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie
of the Romanes.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. The fourth kingdome cannot be the Turkish segnorie, which came 600.
yeares at the least after the other 3. kingdomes were dissolued; but by Daniels description,
the fourth kingdome must followe immediately vpon the dissolution of the other. 2.
Though the Romanes had their beginning from Troy in <hi>Asia minor,</hi> yet that was destroyed
a 1000. yeares well nie before the ende of the three first Monarchies: therefore the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes
could not then be counted one kingdome with the Grecians. 3. Likewise the Turks
came from the mount <hi>Caspian,</hi> and out of the greater Asia: then by this reason they
might as well confound the Turkish gouernement, with the Babylonian or Persian Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie,
which had their chiefe dominions in the greater Asia.</p>
                        <p>3. Therefore <hi>the times of these kings</hi> must be referred vnto the last kings of the fourth
kingdome, which consisted of Syria, and Egypt, as the two legges thereof, as is before
shewed, quest. 50. And so <hi>Hugo</hi> verie well expoundeth, <hi>in diebus vnius ex illis,</hi> in the dayes
of these kings or kingdomes, that is one of them: and in the ende of them as the word is
taken, Ezech. 7. 12. <hi>the time is come,</hi> that is the ende: to the same purpose, <hi>gloss. ordinar.
his regnis pracurrentibus,</hi> these kingdomes going before, as beeing forerunners, the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Christ was both prophesied of and came.</p>
                        <p>This beeing agreed vpon, that this time is the ende of these kingdomes: yet there is this
doubt. <hi>Iunius</hi> seemeth to vnderstand this king to be <hi>Herod,</hi> who was an Arabian, and so of
the kindred of the kings of Syria, who vsurped the kigdome of the Iewes: and in his time
Christ came: But this cannot be so fit to find this forth kingdom, among the people of God
in Iudea, it must be a forren kingdome that was cruell and yron-like towards that nation.</p>

                           <pb n="77" facs="tcp:18834:42"/>
And the kingdome of Syria was dissolued a good while before by Pompey before Herod
was king.</p>
                        <p>Therefore I rather consent to them, which vnderstand <hi>this time</hi> to be the ende of <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi>
house and race: for vntill Herod the house of Ptolomie continued: for Antonie, who
confirmed Herod in his kingdome, married <hi>Cleoptra</hi> the daughter and heire of <hi>Ptolomie

is said to destroy other

                        <p>1. Seeing that three of these Monarchies and kingdomes were destroied before Christs
birth, how is Christs kingdome saide to destroy them: and seeing kingdomes are set vp by
God, and the Apostle saith, <hi>that the powers that be, are ordained of God,</hi>

destroy that, which he setteth vp?</p>

                           <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Though those kingdomes were in act dissolued before Christs comming in
the flesh, yet because Christs kingdome is euerlasting, and beganne not with his incarnation,
those kingdomes were destroied by the power of Christs eternall kingdome: for as the Lord
saith concerning Cyrus, <hi>I guided thee, though thou knewest it not,</hi> Isa. 45. 5. As the Lord
Christ was the founder and setter vp of Cyrus kingdome, to deliuer his people; so the same
kingdome, when it opposed it selfe against Christ and his Church, was by the same power of
Christ pulled downe.</p>
                        <p>2. Christ indeede setteth vp kingdomes in respect of the power and authoritie giuen
vnto them, which is of God: and he maintaineth vpright and iust kings, as the wise man saith,
Prov. 8. 15. <hi>By me kings raigne, and Princes decree iust things.</hi> But vniust kings, and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall

                           <hi>Contra.</hi> But this can not be the meaning: for the idolatrie of the heathen gouernours was
not abolished till the time of Constantine, which was 300. yeares after Christ: beside the
three first Monarchies were dissolued, of the Chaldeans, Persians, Grecians, and yet they
were not purged of their idolatrie.</p>
                        <p>2. Therefore the destruction of these kingdomes must be vnderstood of the outward
ruine and fall of them: as both in fact was euident, that the foure kingdomes described by
the image were so dissolued, and this was best answerable to the vision, wherein the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
was seene to be broken all to pieces, and dashed together by the stone cut out of the

                        <p>1. <hi>Augustine</hi> by this mountaine vnderstandeth the people of the Iewes, <hi>de quo monte

of the Iewes? <hi>Tractat. 9. in Ioann.</hi> but at what time Christ was borne, the kingdome of the
Iewes beeing fallen into the hands of a stranger, when according to Iaakobs prophesie, the

                        <p>2. <hi>Ambrose</hi> reading, in stead <hi>of the stone cut out of the mountaine</hi> (the <hi>mountaine cut out

father; <hi>mons de monte sine manibus, hoc est filius de patre sine aliquo creationis accessu,</hi> the
mountaine cut of the mountaine without hands, that is the sonne of the father without any
creation, &amp;c. <hi>Sermon.</hi> 7. So also <hi>Iustinus Martyr</hi> vnderstandeth it of the eternall generation
of Christ.<note place="margin">Dialog. cum Tryphon.</note> But Daniel here speaketh of a kingdome to be raised vp by God, it had then a
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:18834:43"/>
beginning: but the kingdome of Christ as he is the sonne of God, had no beginning: this
therfore must be vnderstood of Christs kingdom as he is the Mediatour both God and man.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Hyppolitus</hi> referreth it to Christs second comming, and that clause <hi>without hands,</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth,
<hi>secundum Christi adventum fore improvisum,</hi> that the second comming of Christ shal
be sudden, &amp;c. so also <hi>Osiander,</hi> it signifieth that Christ the rocke <hi>subito superventurum,</hi> shall
come suddenly to iudgement: but this cannot be vnderstood of Christs second comming, as
is before shewed, Qu. 51. because this stone after it is cut out shall grow into a mountaine,
and fill all the earth: but the knowledge of Christ shall haue filled all the earth, before his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

                        <p>4. But most interpreters doe interpret it of the miraculous generation of Christ of the
virgin Marie: so <hi>Hierome, Theodoret, Lyran. Vatab.</hi> and <hi>without hands,</hi> signifieth, <hi>sine opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione
humana,</hi> without the helpe of man: and the virgin Marie is compared to a mountaine,
<hi>propter excellentiam virtutum,</hi> because of the excellencie of her vertue. <hi>Pintus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>5. <hi>Bullinger</hi> putteth these together, vnderstanding by the word mountaine, <hi>partim lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum
excelsum, &amp;c.</hi> partly the high place of heauen, partly the people of the Iewes, because he
was borne of the virgin Marie, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. But this cannot be so applied to the virgin Marie, for shee in no sense can be
said to be a mountaine in respect of Christ, and he to be a small stone in respect of her: Marie
was no waies greater then her sonne. 2. Although Christ was borne of Marie <hi>without</hi> the
companie of man, yet his naturall generation was not altogether without the helpe of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
because he was borne of a woman: and therefore <hi>Iustinus</hi> better applieth these words
to Christs eternall generation, which was altogether without hands: it was <hi>non humanum
opus, sed diuinae voluntatis propositum,</hi> no humane worke, but the decree and purpose of the
diuine will. 3. The words are not as they are vsually read, <hi>cut out without hands,</hi> but <hi>cut
out of the mountaine (which is not in hands</hi>) that is, which stone is not at all guided or framed
with hands: that is, Christs kingdome and gouernment is not administred by any humane
policie: this is then to be vnderstood, not of the manner of Christs birth, but of the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of his kingdome.</p>
                        <p>6. Wherefore the meaning is, he was cut out of the mountaine, that is, <hi>è coelis, &amp; loco

Philip. 2. 7.</p>

in that he doth thus postrate himselfe before Daniel, it was a signe of his pietie,

                        <p>1. They which thinke that Nebuchadnezzar adored Daniel as the seruant of the most
high God, as now the Romanists worship Saints, as <hi>Emmanuel Sa.</hi> cannot but thinke that
Daniel might accept this religious adoration yelded vnto him: But neither is any religious
adoration to be giuen vnto Saints: as the Angel refusing to be adored of Iohn, bid him <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
God,</hi> Apocal. 22. 9. and beside to offer incense and sacrifice is a part of diuine worship
due onely vnto God: and therefore Dauid saith: <hi>let my praier be directed in thy sight as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense,
and the lifting vp of my hands, as an euening sacrifice,</hi> Psal. 141. 2. it had beene sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
then, as in the one to offer any part of diuine worship, so in the other to accept it.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Caluin</hi> seemeth to incline, that this might be some error and corruption in Daniel,
which he had learned in the kings Court, in passing it ouer in silence, and suffring this to be
done: <hi>neque tanti esse debet nobis hominis defensio licet perfectissimi,</hi> neither neede we so
much to stand vpon the defense of any though the most perfect man, &amp;c. so also <hi>Geneuens.
Daniel herein erred if he suffered it:</hi> they speake doubtfully, yet both doe thin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> it more
credible, that Daniel did not accept of this honour, but admonished the king: But in this
matter there is no doubt at all: for it is certaine, that Daniel so holy a man, and so iealous
of Gods honour, would neuer haue endured any part of Gods honour to be diminished.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Hierome</hi> whereas <hi>Porphyrie</hi> obiected, and tooke exception against this booke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Daniel refused not this diuine honour exhibited vnto him, maketh this answer, that
all this was Gods worke, the sending of that dreame, and the interpretation thereof, <hi>vt Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel
inde cresceret, &amp;c. &amp; omnipotentia Dei nosceretur,</hi> that Daniel by this meanes might
increase in honour for the comfort of Gods people, and that Gods omnipotencie might be
knowne: So likewise <hi>Theoderet</hi> here hath recourse vnto Gods wonderfull prouidence. But
all this beeing admitted, that herein Gods prouidence is euidently seene: yet thereby Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
cannot be excused if he should haue arrogated any diuine honour to himselfe.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Pellican</hi> thinketh that these sacrifices were not offred to Daniel, but vnto God: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the king saith, <hi>I know of a truth, that your God, is a God of gods:</hi> for <hi>Daniel antever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terat
regem, &amp;c.</hi> Daniel had preuented the king before, vers. 30. that he could not doe this
by his owne wisedome: but God onely was the reuealer of secrets: <hi>Contra.</hi> It is euident by
the text, vers. 46. that the king commanded that these things should be offred vnto Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,
yet as <hi>Lyranus</hi> thinketh, though the king commanded it to be done, <hi>Daniel impediuit
fiers,</hi> Daniel hindred it to be done.</p>
                        <p>5. Wherefore the truth is, that Daniel vtterly refused these diuine honours, though it
be omitted, <hi>breuitatis causa,</hi> for <hi>breuitie sake: Osiand.</hi> And thus it may be shewed. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
such was Daniels pietie, that if he refused to be defiled with the kings meate, much
lesse would he haue endured such grosse superstition. 2. It is said the king answered vnto
Daniel, vers. 47. it seemed then that Daniel vsed some interlocutorie speech, though it be
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:18834:44"/>
not expressed, reclaiming Nebuchadnezzar from these errors. 3. This is euident also by that
singular confession which <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> made of God, that he was otherwise instructed
by Daniel. <hi>Iun. Polan. Pappus.</hi> 4. This further is prooued, for that Daniel afterward would
not intermit the seruice of God, and inuocation of his name, though it were with perill
and danger of his life. cap. 6. <hi>Bulling.</hi> 5. Likewise Daniels behauiour here may be measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the like in other the Saints and seruants of God: as <hi>Peter</hi> would not suffer <hi>Cornelius</hi>
to lie at his feete, Act. 10. nor <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> the men of <hi>Lystra</hi> to sacrifice vnto them,
Act. 14. nor the Angel, the Euangelist Iohn to worship him, Apocal. 22. <hi>Bullinger. 6.
Pererius</hi> affirmeth as much, that Daniel refused these sacrifices; because afterward the Lord
did so greatly honour him, and reward his faithfulnesse with working miracles for his deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and reuealing vnto him many secrets and mysteries in vision.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. It is not possible that any endued with a right and true faith, should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

and open apostasie, and idolatrie.</p>

that this was but a momentanie and sudden affection in Nebuchadnezzar, as was that also
in Pharaoh, Exod. 9. 27. <hi>Geneuens.</hi> for there is a twofold knowledge of God, <hi>momentanea,</hi>
a knowledge for a moment, such as profane men may haue, which are striken with some

knowledge, such as is onely in the elect, <hi>Polan.</hi> And this is an euident argument

                        <head>Quest. 69. VVhether Daniel with a good conscience could be
set ouer the wise men and soothsayers
of Babylon.</head>
                        <p>1. In three things was Daniel rewarded of the king: with gifts, with ciuill authoritie,
beeing appointed chiefe gouernour ouer the prouince of Babel, and with ecclesiasticall iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
ouer the schooles of the wise men, <hi>Iun.</hi> as it were their <hi>Superintendent. Osiand.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. In this office of his superintendentship, 1. such laudable sciences as might safely be
learned, he promoted and furthered. 2. such corruption and superstitions, as were practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
among them, he corrected and reformed. 3. but such abuses, as could not be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
he for his owne part forbeared and kept himselfe free from. <hi>Iun.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Caluin</hi> thinketh, <hi>quod repudiauit hunc honorem,</hi> he refused this honour, in cap. 5. ver.
10. but this would haue beene euill taken of the king: it is more like that he vsed the place
with such moderation, as is before shewed.</p>

                        <head>Quest. 70. How Daniel is said to haue sate
in the kings gate.</head>
                        <p>1. Some giue this sense, that Daniel sate in the gate, <hi>vt ius diceret, &amp;c.</hi> to giue iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
because they vsed to that ende to sit in the gate, <hi>Vatab. Pint.</hi> But the other three al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
were made gouernours ouer the Prouince of Babel, to whose office it belonged to giue
iudgement: this then was rather some particular dignitie, which Daniel had.</p>
                        <p>2. Some expound it, that he was, <hi>à latere regis non recedens,</hi> one that departed not from
the king, but was alwaies at hand: <hi>gloss. interlin.</hi> and thus Daniel did, least in his absence
some might bring him out of the kings fauour: <hi>Lyran.</hi> But yet this had beene no peculiar
thing to Daniel, for there were many beside, which were neere the king.</p>
                        <p>3. Some thinke, that this is expressed to shew a difference between Daniels office, and
the other three; that they were employed abroad in their places of gouernement, and Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
stayed still in the Court: <hi>Bulling.</hi> but this had beene no speciall prerogatiue more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the kings Court had.</p>
                        <p>4. Some so take it, that Daniel onely of these foure was aduanced to the office of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement,
and the other three were made ourseers of mens labours and taske, <hi>ex Lyran.</hi>
But this had beene no such place of authoritie, for Daniel to make request for vnto the
king.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi>Caluin</hi> thinketh that Daniel had such an office in the Court, that no man could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the kings palace, <hi>sine eius permissu,</hi> without his leaue: but that was the porters office
to keepe out strangers from entring into the kings Court or Palace.</p>
                        <p>6. Therefore this rather is the meaning, <hi>admissionis ius ad regem Danieli commissum,</hi>
that the power of admitting men vnto the kings presence was committed vnto Daniel: for
it was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not for euerie one to come into the kings presence, but for certaine of the chiefe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
thereunto appointed of the king. <hi>Iun. Polan.</hi> Genevens.</p>

                        <head>Quest. 71. Whether it be lawfull for a Christian to
liue in an idolatrous kings Court.</head>
                        <p>1. It may appeare by the examples of Ioseph, who liued in Pharaohs Court, and of
<hi>Mardocheus,</hi> who was neere vnto king <hi>Assuerus:</hi> and by Daniel here, that it is not vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to beare office in forren Princes Courts: but two things must aduisedly be considered,
and thought vpon: 1. that they doe not propound vnto themselues such places of honour
for their owne aduantage, but to seeke the welfare of the people of God, as Daniel here
doth. 2. that they defile not themselues with the superstitious and idolatrous vsages in
such places, as these three in the next chapter, beeing chiefe officers, yet refused to worship
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:18834:45"/>
the kings golden image.</p>
                        <p>2. And as it is lawfull to enioy such places of honour, so it is not inconuenient for kings
to set sometime strangers in place of gouernement, such as for their wisedome and pietie,
are fit: but not to that ende, to make a pray of such places of gouernement.</p>

of the soule.</head>
                        <p>Vers. 4. <hi>O King liue for euer:</hi> These heathen men voide of the true knowledge of God,
in wishing eternall life vnto the king, doe shewe their opinion of the immortalitie of the
soule: which shall further be prooued, 1. by the testimonie of Scripture. 2. by the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of reason. 3. and by the euidence of forren and heathen witnesses.</p>
                        <p>1. The Scripture plentifully testifieth, that the soule liueth after it is separated from the
bodie: as in that the Lord calleth himselfe, the God of <hi>Abraham, Isaac, and Iaacob,</hi> long
after their death, Exod. 3. 6. whereupon our Sauiour inferreth, that <hi>he is not God of the
dead, but of the liuing:</hi> So Elias prayed vnto God to haue his hostesses child restored to life
in these words, <hi>I pray thee let this childs soule returne vnto him againe,</hi> 1. King 17. 22. his
soule then was aliue, for otherwise it could not returne to his bodie. Salomon saith that the
<hi>spirit returneth to God that gaue it,</hi> Eccle. 12. 7. In the parable Luk. 16. the soule of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus
was carried by the Angels into Abrahams bosome.</p>
                        <p>2. 1. Seeing God is most iust, and will recompence euerie man according to his life, the
righteous shall haue reward, and the wicked punishment, which is not alwaies seene in
this life, it must needs be, that God should execute his iustice in another life. 2. Seeing ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
which is in the minde is immortall; the subject also thereof, the soule must also needes
be immortall. 3. And the soule beeing not subiect to corruption, is consequently immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall:
for that which is incorruptible is immortall. 4. All things haue a place of rest, as the
center is vnto bodies: the soule is restlesse in the bodie, and neuer is at quiet; if then it should
not haue a place of rest elswhere, it should be more miserable then any other creature. 5. And
how could the soule thinke of things immortall or desire them, if it were not it selfe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall.</p>
                        <p>3. By these reasons, and such like the heathen beeing perswaded, beleeued the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie
of the soule: as <hi>Antiochus</hi> in his epistle to <hi>Lysias,</hi> that beginneth, <hi>Since our father is
translated to the gods, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Macchab. 11. 23. In the funeralls of such Romane Emperours
as had deserued well of the commonwealth, they vsed to set an eagle, and to put fire vnder,
which the eagle feeling soared aloft: whereby was signified, that the soule or spirit ascended
vp into heauen: <hi>Herodian, Pythagoras,</hi> and <hi>Thales Milesius,</hi> were strong maintainers of the
immortalitie of the soule, likewise <hi>Plutarkain epistol. consola.</hi> and <hi>Seneca, lib. de morte
immatura. Euripides</hi> held <hi>coelos esse aeterna animarum domicilia,</hi> that the heauens, are the
eternall houses of the soules. Many such like testimonies and examples might be brought
from the heathen to this purpose.</p>

the toppe and height of the Saints. 3. he applieth vnto the virgin Marie those places in
the Psalmes: as Psal. 68. 15. <hi>The mountaine of God is a fat mountaine, &amp;c. God delighteth to
dwell in it, yea the Lord will dwell in it for euer:</hi> and, Ps. 87. 1. <hi>His foundation is among the hills.</hi>

Sarah that bare you:</hi> but Christ had no father, out of whose loynes he should be taken forth,
and as it were cut out: therefore this phrase of speach nothing helpeth his conceit of the
virgin Marie.</p>
                        <p>2. The question is not, how Marie may be said to be a mountaine in respect of other
Saints (and yet it may be doubted of, whether Marie doe so farre excell in vertue all the
Saints, that euer liued) but the doubt is, whether Marie can be saide to be a mountaine in
comparison of Christ, who is the stone cut out of this mountaine: to make Marie the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
and Christ the little stone cut out thence, is a presumptuous comparison: for so Marie
should be greater then Christ.</p>
                        <p>3. It is euident, that the Psalmist speaketh there of the hillie countrey of Canaan, and
specially of mount Sion, where the Lord had made choice to make his habitation: and so,
Psal. 87. he expoundeth himselfe in the second verse, <hi>The Lord loueth the gates of Zion aboue
all the habitations of Iaakob: glorious things are spoken of the citie of God, &amp;c.</hi> Wherefore it is
a fond exposition, to appropriate that to Marie, which is spoken of the whole Church of
God: neither can they shew how Marie, beeing a mortall woman, could be the habitation of
God for euer.</p>
                        <p>4. This mountaine then is not vnderstood of Marie. 1. she can not be likened to a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
and Christ to a little stone, as greater then he. 2. this stone is cut out without hands,
that is, without any humane helpe at all: but in the incarnation of Christ, woman was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument,
though not man, therefore it was not without hands. 3. Marie doth make her
selfe of low degree, Luk. 1. 52. she was then more like a valley then a mountaine: see more of

their triall, to v. 13. 2. their probation it selfe, to v. 22. 3. the euents that followed
from thence, to the end of the chapter.</p>
                     <p>1. The occasion is double. 1. the fact of Nabuchadnezzer, in setting vp a golden i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
with his decree adioyned thereunto, v. 8. 2. the accusation of certaine Chaldees.</p>
                     <p>1. In the first accusation is set forth, 1. Nabuchadnezzers act, in erecting an image, which
is described by the matter, preparation, and place, v. 1. 2. Then followeth a double decree,
1. to summon and call all the Nobles together, which accordingly was done, v. 2. 3. 2. to
command all to fall downe, as soone as they heard the sound of the instruments, vpon paine
to be cast into the furnace, v. 4. 5. which accordingly is performed by the people, v. 7.</p>
                     <p>2. The other occasion is the accusation of the Chaldees, which containeth, 1. their salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and insinuation to the king, v. 9. 2. a narration of his decree, v. 11, 12. 3. then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
the accusation it selfe: they are charged with vnthankfulnes, and disobedience,
v. 12.</p>
                     <p>2. Their probation is seene, 1. in the kings examination. 2. in their suffering. 1. in the
examination, there is 1. the kings speach, which containeth both a friendly perswasion, and
a seuere threatning and commination, v. 14, 15. 2. their answer is disi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

parts: 1. that God it able to deliuer them. 2. though it please him not at this time to doe
it, yet they are resolued not to worship his image, v. 17, 18.</p>
                     <p>2. The second part is their suffering. 1. there is the kings charge, that they should heat
the furnace seuen times more, and cast them bound into it, v. 19. 2. the execution follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
v. 20.</p>
                     <p>3. The euents are three. 1. their accusers are destroied of the flames, v. 21. 2. the three
seruants of God are deliuered from the fire: which is set forth in 3. degrees. 1. they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
walking in the furnace without hurt, and a fourth with them, which is set forth dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue-wise
betweene Nabuchadnezzer and his Nobles, v. 24, 25. 2. they are bid to come
forth, v. 26. 3. the manner of the miracle is declared, neither their bodies, haire, or gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
had so much as any smell of fire.</p>
                     <p>3. Then followeth the third euent, the conuersion of the king with the fruits and effects
thereof: the seuerall particulars see afterward, quest. 37.</p>

                     <p>8. Hereupon at the same time came men of the Chaldeans, and grieuously accused the
Iewes. <hi>G. I. (cried out accusations of the Iewes. C.</hi>)</p>
                     <p>9. And they spake and said vnto Nebuchadnezzar the king, O King, liue for euer.</p>
                     <p>10. Thou O king hast set forth <hi>I. (made. G. B.</hi>) a decree, that euery man that shall heare

                     <p>11. And whosoeuer falleth not downe, and boweth himselfe, shall be cast into the mids

                     <p>12. There are certaine Iewes, whom thou hast set ouer the busines of the prouince of

ye fall downe and bow vnto the image, which I haue made, <hi>it is well: (this must be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

                     <p>16. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered, and said vnto the king, O Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzer,

                     <p>17. Either it will be, our God whome we worship, beeing able to deliuer vs out of the

                     <p>26. Then the king Nebuchadnezzar came neere to the mouth. <hi>G. B. (the doore. C. cum

the seruants of the high God, goe forth and come <hi>hither:</hi> then Shadrach, Meshach, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bednego,
came forth of the middes of the fire.</p>
                     <p>27. Then the nobles, princes, and dukes, and the kings counsellers (<hi>mightie ones. L. go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours.
I.</hi>) came together to see these men, because the fire had no power ouer their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies:
for not an haire of their head was burnt, neither were their coates changed, not any
smell of fire came (<hi>passed. C.</hi>) vpon them:</p>
                     <p>28. <hi>Wherefore</hi> Nebuchadnezzar spake and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shach,
and Abednego, who hath sent his Angel, and deliuered, his seruants, that put their
trust in him, and haue altered the kings commandement, and yeelded their bodies, that they
should not serue, nor bowe vnto any god, saue their owne God.</p>
                     <p>29. Therefore I set forth a decree, that euery people, nation, and language, which shall
speake any blasphemie (<hi>error. C.</hi>) against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,
shall be drawne in peices (<hi>shall perish. L.</hi>) and his house be made a iakes (<hi>be vasted. L.</hi>) because
there is not any other God (<hi>there is no God. B. G. but here the word (other) is omitted</hi>) which
can deliuer after this sort.</p>
                     <p>30. Then the king aduanced (<hi>caused to prosper. C.</hi>) Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,

had: as the Rabbines that imagine this image to be set vp by the king, as an amulet
or defense to preuent the effect of his dreame. <hi>ex Caluin.</hi> But it is not like that the great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
which that vision left behind it in Nebuchadnezzars minde, could be so soone ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Theodoret</hi> and <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> in his sermon of the three children, following some
greeke copie, reade, that this image was set vp in the 18. yeare of Nebuchadnezzars raigne.
But then it should haue beene made before the destruction and desolation of Ierusalem,
which is not like: for when Nebuchadnezzar had made an ende of his conquests, then it is
probable he set vp this image by way of tryumph: and <hi>Azarias</hi> in his prayer, (though that
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:18834:50"/>
part be Apocryphall, yet it may haue some probabilitie, for matter of storie) maketh menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that they had neither prince, nor sacrifice, or burnt offring: which sheweth, that this fell
not out before the destruction of Ierusalem: likewise <hi>Theodoret,</hi> who saith that this fell out
<hi>paruo tempore,</hi> a small time after the first dreame, which was in the second yeare, is contrarie
to himselfe: for betweene the second and 18. yeare, there are 16. yeares, which is no small
time.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Pererius</hi> also is deceiued, who thinketh that this was done after the 25. yeare of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzars
raigne: for the second yeare of his Monarchie he reckoneth to fall out in the
25. yeare of his raigne: but this is before confuted, quest. 1. c. 2. where it is further shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that this second yeare which is to be vnderstood of Daniels seruice and ministerie, was
in the 5. yeare of Nebuchadnezzars raigne.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Pellican</hi> saith this storie happened 16. yeares after the dreame; but that is vncertaine.</p>
                        <p>5. Wherefore here somewhat is certaine, that this storie came after the interpretation of
the kings dreame set forth in the 2. chap. because ver. 12. mention is made of the aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Daniels three fellowes, which was immediately after Daniel had interpreted the
kings dreame, cap. 2. 49. somewhat is probable, that it was after the sacking and taking of
Ierusalem, as is said before, <hi>Pap.</hi> for many of the Iewes were now in captiuitie, ver. 8. some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is vncertaine, how long this historie followed after the interpretation of Daniels

                        <p>1. <hi>Lyranus</hi> thinketh that Nebuchadnezzar set vp this image for himselfe, requiring di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
honour to be giuen vnto it, as <hi>Caligula</hi> caused his image to be carried about the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane

that he which had so humbled himselfe before vnto Daniel, could be so lifted vp in pride, to

                        <p>2. Neither is it like, that Nebuchadnezzar set vp this image of a good intention, to the

                        <p>1. Some thinke, that by setting vp this image Nebuchadnezzar would retaine a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of that image, which he sawe in his dreame, thinking thereby to please God, <hi>Pap.</hi> But
then he would not haue made such a cruell edict against the seruants of that great God.</p>
                        <p>2. Againe it may be thought, that he did it, to haue an vniformitie in religion, through all
his dominions, which consisted of diuerse nations, but then he would haue commanded
the like image to be set vp in euery prouince.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Caluine</hi> thinketh he did it to this ende to settle the superstitious worship of idolatrie,
least the Iewes might haue sought some innouation in religion.</p>
                        <p>4. But it is most probable, that Nebuchadnezzar did it by the aduise of his nobles, and
princes, of enuie against the Iewes, especially those which were aduanced to place of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement,
that they might thereby entrappe them: which may appeare so to be by these
reasons. 1. by the like practise against Daniel, cap. 6. 2. by the generall accusation of the
Iewes, ver. 8. 3. to what ende els tended the cruell edict of the king, but to be executed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

that dreame stroke him with such a terror, as that it is not like he would contemne it.</p>

                        <p>1. Some thinke that Daniel beeing present, <hi>tacuit videns se nihil proficere,</hi> did hoid his

peace seeing that he could preuaile nothing, but that the king was resolute in his purpose:

the successe vnto God.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Osiander</hi> thinketh that Daniel vsed what perswasion he could, but seeing he was not

if he had now hid himselfe.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Pappus</hi> is of opinion, that Daniel was employed in some remote place of the prouince

before, this great image was not made in a short time.</p>
                        <p>4. Wherefore it is not to be doubted, but that Daniel did discharge the office of a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
seruant vnto God and counseller to the king before this, and did vse all meanes to stay
this vngodly enterprise, so farre as he might goe, without exasperating of the king too much,
which would haue kindled his anger against the whole nation: Therefore Daniel not preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
gaue way vnto the time, expecting some other meanes how it should please the Lord

                        <head>Quest. 6. Of the greatnesse of this image compared with
others and in it selfe.</head>
                        <p>1. Some greater images haue beene made in the world: as the image of the Sunne at
Rhodes, called <hi>colossus solis,</hi> was 70. cubites high; which was 12. yeares in making, and cost
300. talents: 56. yeares after it was made, it was cast downe by an earthquake, and then the
hugenes thereof appeared: few men could fadome that thumbe thereof, and the fingers were
bigger then ordinarie images: it broke in peices in the fall, and great caues and hoales were
opened, wherein were couched huge stones to keepe the image vpright, <hi>Plin. lib.</hi> 34. cap. 7.
Greater also then this was the <hi>colossus</hi> of Nero, which was an 110. foote long, and an ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
picture made of him in cloth, an 120. foote high: yet this image because it was of gold,
in value may seeme to exceede all other: the ordinarie cubite is foote and halfe, but the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonian
cubite as Herodotus saith, was 3. fingers greater then the common cubite: so that
by this account, this image might be 67. ordinarie cubites high. Herodotus writeth that in
his time there was a golden image at Babylon, which was 12. cubites high, which might be
that image, that euery stranger was required to worship before he was permitted to come
into Babylon to see the citie, as <hi>Philostrat.</hi> saith, <hi>de vita Apollin. cap.</hi> 19.</p>
                        <p>2. This image was made proportionable to a mans bodie, euerie part answerable vnto
the other in due forme and measure, by which proportion the greatnesse of euerie part of the
image may be taken: there is the same distance betweene the endes of the fingers, the armes
spread abroad, from one extremitie to the other, which is betweene the crowne of the head,
to the soale of the feete, <hi>Plin. lib. 7. cap.</hi> 17. the face from the chinne to the toppe of the
forehead, is the tenth part of the length of the bodie. And the face is diuided into three e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
parts, from the chinne to the nose, the length of the nose, and the breadth of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head:
the length of the eie from one corner to another is the 45. part, and so is the distance
betweene the eyes: the length of the nose is the thirtith part, and the widenes of the nostrils
the 180, part: the compasse of the eare and of the mouth, is the 15. part: the head from the
chinne to the crowne, is the 8. part: the length and likewise the breadth of the breast, the sixt
part: the nauill is in the middest of the bodie, diuiding it into two equall parts, the length
of the hippes, thighes, and legges is almost the halfe part: the length of the foote is the sixt
part, and so is the space from the shoulder to the elbowe, and from the elbowe to the hand:
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:18834:51"/>
the hand is the 10. part.</p>
                        <p>3. After this proportion, the whole image beeing 60. cubites in height, the face must be
sixe cubites, the chinne two cubites, the nose and forehead as much, the nostrills must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
halfe a foote, the compasse of the eare and mouth 4. cubites, and so much the necke:
the breast 10. cubites, the length of the thighs and legges 29. cubites, the foote tenne, and
the hand sixe: thus <hi>Pererius</hi> casteth the proportion of euery part.</p>
                        <p>4. But herein is his error, he taketh the height of the bodie of the image to be 60. cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites,
whereas, as <hi>Lyranus</hi> well noteth, in this measure is comprehended the foote also or
foundation whereupon the image stood: for otherwise it should not be proportionable, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
60, cubites high, and but sixe cubites broad: for the length of a man is but sixe times to
the breadth, and tenne times to the thicknes: If the bodie be sixe cubites high, it is but a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite
broad: then 6. cubites broad will haue but 36. cubites in height.</p>
                        <p>5. As this image was huge in the height and stature, so it was verie costly, beeing all of
gold, though it be not necessarie with <hi>Hierome,</hi> to thinke that it was made of solid golde,
but either the outside onely of it, was gold, or it was made hollowe, as <hi>Lyranus</hi> well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectureth.</p>

to sing holy hymnes and psalmes, whereupon it had the name psalterie; such as Dauid vsed:
and this is most like.</p>

the Psalmist saith, <hi>Come let vs worship, and fall downe, and kneele before the Lord our maker:</hi>
the three wise men, Matth. 2. fell downe and worshipped Christ: so did the blind man, Ioh.

his heart abhorre it.</head>
                        <p>1. There are three sorts of men, which doe thinke they may be dispensed withall for the
outward reuerent gesture yeelded vnto an image, hauing their heart free: as they which doe
it to conforme themselues to please the Prince, or for feare to escape the perill of death, or
some other grieuous punishment: or such which doe come vnto idolatrous seruice, onely to
see the manner of it, and the pompe of Papall superstitious ceremonies.</p>
                        <p>2. But all these are found to be in great error. 1. the Lord in the second commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
directly forbiddeth to bow downe vnto such images. And the Lord saith to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
Elias, that he had reserued seuen thousand, that had not bowed their knees vnto Baal, 1.
King. 18. 19. 2. Our bodies together with our soules are the temples of the Spirit, and
therefore neither the one, nor the other should be defiled, but preserued pure and holy for
the Lord, <hi>Polan.</hi> 3. It satisfieth the idolaters themselues, if men be but conformable in their
outward gesture, to their idolatrous seruice: as here Nabuchadnezzer exacteth no confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the mouth, or subscription with the hand of or vnto this image, but onely to fall down
and worship it. <hi>Calv.</hi> 4. In the purer ages of the Church euen they were held to be idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
which beeing constrained by force, did yeeld the least outward seruice vnto the idols of
the Gentiles: as Origen, as <hi>Suidas</hi> writeth, was excommunicate of the Church, for holding a
little incense in his hand before an idol. 5. The Romanists will not come at our Churches
and seruice, where yet there is no externall obiect that may offend them, therefore much
lesse should Protestants shew such weaknes to assemble with them in their idolatrous tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
which lay so many stumbling blocks before the eyes.</p>

                        <p>1. It may seeme that the principall and chiefe men were onely or especially called, and
that the vulgar and common sort of people were not all present: or at the least, the principall
men were most marked, and obserued, whose example the rest might follow, <hi>Pere,</hi> but it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
by their general accusation of the Iewes, v. 8. that there were more Iewes present then
these three.</p>
                        <p>2. It may be also supposed, that the vulgar sort of the Iewish people, which were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
did for feare doe as the rest did, fall downe and worship, therefore they were not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of, <hi>Perer.</hi> It is very like indeede, that many Iewes did fall away in time of captiuitie
to worship the Chaldean images, because many of them had beene idolaters in their owne
countrey, for the which they were carried into captiuitie: but that some other of the Iewes
beside these three, refused to fall downe, may be gathered by the generall accusation against
the Iewes, but principally against these three.</p>
                        <p>3. Wherefore this is like to be the cause, why these three are singled out, because they
were aduanced to honourable place of gouernment, and for this cause were enuied and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligned
of the Chaldees: and this may be gathered by their manner of accusation, v. 12. wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they specially vrge that point, that the king had set them ouer the prouince of Babel,
that seemed to be an eye-soare and a griefe vnto them. Why Daniel was not accused with

they might be 10. yeare old, when they went into captiuitie, and in the 25. yeare of Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzer
he had that dreame of the image: But though <hi>Pererius</hi> opinion be probable for

<hi>the three children:</hi> either for that they were children at their first going into captiuitie, or
they are so called according to the phrase of Scripture, that young men, and they which were

not worship his owne image, as <hi>gloss. ordin. Hugo.</hi> or that they did forbeare to accuse him,

in malicia, &amp; ideo tacuit, &amp;c.</hi> he saw the king setled and obstinate in his malice, and
therefore held his peace. But Daniel had offended much, if beeing present, he should by his
silence and connivence haue betraied these innocents, as the wise man saith, Prou. 24. 11.
<hi>Wilt thou not preserue them, that are lead to be slaine?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Pererius</hi> thinketh that Daniel beeing a great Prophet might foresee that God would
deliuer them out of this daunger by some great miracle, that thereby the power and glorie
of God might be set forth: as our blessed Sauiour suffered Lazarus to die, that he might get
greater glorie by raising him vp againe out of his graue.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. Our blessed Sauiour and Daniel, the master and the seruant, are not well
matched together: Christ had all power and knowledge in himselfe, so had not Daniel. 2.
he knew not of his deliuerance from the Lyons himselfe, when he was cast into their denne:
for then it had beene no triall of his saith, if he had bin sure to be deliuered, much lesse is it
like, that he foresaw the miraculous deliuerance of these.</p>
                        <p>3. Therefore Daniel is excused by his absence, and ignorance: he neither was present, and
so consequently was ignorant of all that now happened, beeing done speedily and in hast:
see before qu. 4.</p>

                        <p>1. The equitie of the king herein deserueth commendation, that would not presently

                        <p>3. He doth first seeke to win them by gentle speech: as though he could not beleeue it to
be true, that they had done this thing, or if they did, it was of some ouersight, rather then of
purpose: which he was content to pardon, if now they would worship the image: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side

                        <p>1. Whereas the king first insinuateth himselfe, as though he did not beleeue, that they
would doe such a thing, and thereby suggesteth vnto them, that they should be better adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed:
which kind of humane and fauourable questioning <hi>Suetonius</hi> noteth to haue bin much
vsed by <hi>Augustus,</hi> who in examining those which were guiltie, would seeme as though he
beleeued not any such thing to be done by them: to this vncertentie in the kings demaund,
they answer resolutely, that they needed no consultation in that matter, they had their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer

                        <p>2. To the kings blasphemie, that there was no God to deliuer them out of his hand; they
replie, that their God, whome they serued, was able to deliuer them out of his hand.</p>
                        <p>3. Touching the kings threatning of the fierie fornace, they answer in effect that it did
not mooue them, they feared it not, though their God for some causes knowne to himselfe,
should leaue them in his hands, yet they would not worship the image.</p>
                        <p>4. And as the king would admit no discussing of his decree, but would haue it absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obeied: so they could not be remooued from their religion: neither desired to haue the

                        <p>1. The godly Hebrewes were not ignorant how often they were charged by Moses, and
the Prophets, not to bow vnto, or worship images, as Exod. 20. in the second commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Deut. c. 4. and c. 27. Isa. 44. and Ierem. 10. and in many places beside: that no one thing
in Scripture is more straightly giuen them in charge.</p>
                        <p>2. They had the example of the godly Patriarkes and kings, and other holy men, who
had a perfect detestation of idols: as <hi>Iaacob</hi> burned all the images in his house vnder an oak,
Gen. 35. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> pulled down the brasen serpent, when they began to abuse it to idolatrie.</p>
                        <p>3. Yea in the most corrupt times after their returne out of the captiuitie, the Iewes ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred
images: for when Pilatus and Petronius the presidents of Iewrie had secretly brought
the images of <hi>Tiberius</hi> and <hi>Caligula</hi> into the citie, to be worshipped of the Iewes, they man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
resisted, offering their necks and liues, rather then they would contrarie to their law
worship any images. <hi>Ioseph. lib. 18. antiquit. c. 4. &amp;</hi> 10. who further writeth, <hi>l. 2. cont. Appia.</hi>
that when Alexander the great would haue repaired the Temple and sepulchre of Bel the

                        <p>v. 19. <hi>Nabuchadnezzer</hi> commanded these three holy men to be cast into the fierie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen:
wherein he offended three waies: 1. in the action it selfe, in forcing his religion by tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of death. 2. in the manner, he did it in his rage. 3. in respect of the persons perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
they were innocent, they suffered for keeping of the law of God: But that generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is not to be forced by torment, it may be thus perswaded.</p>
                        <p>1. It is against the nature of faith to be forced vnto by violence: <hi>doceri non cogi vult fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>
religion must be taught, not enforced. <hi>Polan.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. Idolaters, heretikes, and persecutors of the true faith, by vnspeakable torments, and
cruell death, did vrge their heresies, idolatrie, and superstitions to be kept: As this was the
engine, wherewith the heathen Emperours assaulted the Christians, persecuting them by fire
and sword: As <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> writeth of <hi>Nero,</hi> that he caused the Christians to be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
specially in the night, <hi>in vsum nocturni luminis,</hi> in stead of night lampes: So the truth is
not to be defended and maintained by the same weapons, wherewith false religion fighteth:
for the fruits of the spirit, are <hi>loue, peace, gentlenes,</hi> Gal. 5. 22.</p>
                        <p>3. But it therefore followeth not, because religion is not to be forced by punishment of
death, that therefore euery one is to be left vnto himselfe: there are other forcible meanes by
penall lawes to containe men in an vniforme profession of the true faith, then by death. <hi>Iosias</hi>
put downe the Chemarims idolatrous Priests, but he put them not to death. 2. King. 23. 5.</p>
                        <p>4. Yet such as are manifest blasphemers and heretikes, are to be cut off by the sword, as
<hi>Servetus</hi> was at Geneva: so that in the inflicting of the punishment of death for false religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
a double difference is to be made: 1. between those, which do maintaine manifest here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
and blasphemie, and such as hold other vnsound opinions: and in the first sort, betweene
such as are obstinate and peruerse, and those which are seduced of ignorance and simplicitie.</p>

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:18834:54"/>
commanded the fornace to be made hoat with pitch, and towe, and a kind of liquid brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
called <hi>naptha,</hi> and small twigges and spriggs of vines, or such like called <hi>malleoli,</hi> which

                        </p>
                        <p>2. And concerning <hi>naptha,</hi> whereof there are fountaines in Babylon, which is an hoate
countrey full of brimstone, and in diuers places flaming out with fire: and as <hi>Plutarke</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
the earth is so hoat, that they are constrained to lie in water: this <hi>naptha</hi> is of such
force, that whatsoeuer is besmeared therewith, taketh fire in such sort, as that it can not be
quenched but with vineger and allume, and such like, as <hi>Sirabo</hi> writeth, <hi>lib.</hi> 16. how Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to take triall of the nature thereof, caused a boy beeing in the water to be annointed
with <hi>naptha,</hi> and so a candle put to him, who so burned, that if they had not with much wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

did cast certaine droppes vpon the way, which in the night tooke the flame one from an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

                        <p>3. But because in the originall historie there is no mention made of these things, that
the fire should be tempered with: nor yet that the fornace should flame 49. cubits, v. 46. in
the Apocryphall addition; we neede not busie our selues with searching out the nature of
these things: it sufficeth to know, as it is in the text, that the fornace was made hoat 7. times

would not accuse Daniel, because he was in such fauour with the king, <hi>Calvin. Polan.</hi> but
he was in as great fauour afterward with Darius, and yet he was cast into the lyons denne, c.
8. 2. some thinke that Daniel stood by the king, who did not worship his owne image,
and so Daniel doing as the king did, beeing the next man vnto him, was not found fault
withall. But the text ouerthroweth this conceit, the decree was generall, v. 11. that whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
did not fall downe, should be cast into the fierie fornace: Daniel then could not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
from so generall a decree. 3. some thinke that Daniel did in outward gesture doe
as the rest did, and by this example the <hi>Nicomedians</hi> would iustifie their dissimulation, in
bowing their knee vnto an idol, and yet keeping their heart for God. But seeing Daniel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
to defile himselfe with eating the kings meate, much more would he haue counted
this a pollution, to haue bowed to this filthie idol.</p>
                        <p>3. Wherefore the safer opinion is, that Daniel was not at this time present: his charge
was to keepe the kings palace, and he was chiefe gouernour ouer the whole prouince of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel:
the king then beeing absent from Babylon, to solemnize the dedication of this image
which was in the region <hi>Susiane,</hi> by all likelihood committed vnto Daniel the gouernment
of the citie and prouince of Babel, till his returne.</p>

                        <p>v. 22. <hi>The flame of the fire slew those men, &amp;c. 1. Lyranus</hi> well obserueth, that this is
set downe by anticipation: for first the three men were cast into the fierie fornace, and then
at the comming of the Angel, the fire was kept from their bodies, and raged vpon their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.</p>
                        <p>2. It is like that these men had beene the chiefe perswaders of the king, to deuise this
torment, and were the most forward in this cruell execution, and therefore they tast of the
same punishment, which they had prepared for others: as they which accused Daniel, and
caused him to be cast into the lyons denne, themselues were deuoured of the lyons, <hi>Pintus.</hi>
and they are iustly punished, because they yeeld obedience to the king, <hi>in re scelerata,</hi> in a

                        <p>3. It pleased God, that the fire should first destroy these wicked instruments, both for
the more certentie of the miracle, seeing the same fire preserued some, and consumed others:
and that the king might be more nearely touched: <hi>punitis principibus rex corripitur,</hi> the king

ver. 23. they were then in the middes, before the fire consumed their bandes.</p>
                        <p>2. Some thinke, that the Angel did cause a cold ayre to blowe in the middes of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace,
and so they were deliuered from the heat of the fire, <hi>interponendo corpus frigidum,</hi> by
the enterposing of some cold bodie, <hi>Perer.</hi> this also is affirmed by the Apocryphall storie, ver.

fire did not so much as touch their garments, as they passed through the flames, so it should
be another, for the fire not to be que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ched with this dew: but miracles must not be multiplied
without cause. 2. this also derogateth from the power of God, as though he could not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately

creature.</p>
                        <p>3. The third opinion is, that God restrained the burning qualitie of the fire: for he that
first endued the elements with their seuerall qualities, can withhold and suspend them at his
pleasure: thus thinketh Basil, that <hi>vis vrendi,</hi> the force of burning, did not <hi>fungi suo munere,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">in Psal. 28.</note>

this preseruation of them from the fire.</head>
                        <p>1. The first is, that whereas the fire hath two properties concurring together, the light
and the heat, that now by the power of God they are separated: here is light without bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
and in hell fire there shal be burning without light: as Basil noteth in the former place,
<hi>talis est ignis inferni, vt cum maxime vret, minime tamen luceat, &amp;c.</hi> such is the fire of hell
that when it burneth most it giueth least light, <hi>Pere.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. This fire hath contrarie effects, it preserueth those which are within, and consumeth
those which are without: like as the waters of the redde Sea, were a defense vnto the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,
and a confusion to the Egyptians: and the lyons which spared Daniel, deuoured his
accusers, <hi>Bulling.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. The fire burned asunder their bands, but their bodies and garments, it had no power
to touch: so obserueth <hi>Hierome, ardent vincula, sed vinctorum corpora non tangit, &amp;c.</hi> their
bands are burnt, but the bodies of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which were bound the fire toucheth not: so also <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">4. homil. ad popul. Antioch. lib. 3. dialog. cap. 18.</note>
                           <hi>Compedes disrupit ignis, talos non tetigit,</hi> the fire brake their fetters, and yet touched
not their ankels; so <hi>Gregorie, vt haberet flamma virtutem ad solatium, non haberet ad tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,
&amp;c.</hi> so that the flame had it force for their comfort, but not to their torment.</p>
                        <p>4. In the fire they breathed and walked, whereas the fire and smoake vseth to suffocate,
and stoppe the breath: <hi>Pererius</hi> addeth further, that in the mids of the fire, they made an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporall
song or psalme, to the praise of God. It is not to be doubted, but that they prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
God; but that long himne, which is extant in the vulgar Latine edition, it is not like they
vttered: because it is not extant in the originall: so that it seemeth to haue beene added by
some interpreter to set forth the pietie and deuotion of these holy men.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi>Pererius</hi> following the vulgar Latine, maketh this another miracle, that a pleasant
coole winde with a moist dewe was sent of God into the middes of the fornace: But no
such thing is extant in the originall: thus much may be gathered out of the text by their wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in the middes of the fire, that neither the smoake nor heat, was any annoyance vnto
them at all, but they had their free libertie, as though they had walked in the coole and fresh
ayre.</p>
                        <p>6. This was admirable, that not onely their bodies, but their garments, yea the haire of
their head, was kept from the fire: and there was not so much as the smell of fire about
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:18834:56"/>
them, ver. 27.</p>
                        <p>7. Lastly, it seemeth that Nebuchadnezzar onely, whose conuersion the Lord principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intended by this miracle, sawe the Angel of God walking in the fierie fornace in the
forme of man.</p>
                        <p>8. The like narration <hi>Pererius</hi> reporteth out of <hi>Gregorie,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">lib. 3 dialog. cap. 18.</note> of a young man called <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictus,</hi>

to burne in his cell, and set fire round about it, but all other things beeing consumed, his
cell remained vntouched; whereupon they drewe him out, and cast him into a fierie ouen:
but he the next day was found without any hurt of the fire, not so much as his garments
touched. But the report of this miracle I leaue to the iudgement of the vnderstanding rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
this we knowe, that that age was giuen too much to such miraculous reports: and that
many fabulous narrations haue beene thrust vnder the name of the fathers.</p>

<hi>Aristotle</hi> writeth of a certaine stone called <hi>anthrax,</hi> which the fire cannot worke vpon,<note place="margin">lib. 11. cap. 37.</note> no
not so much as to heate it: the same author also writeth of a certaine little beast with feete,

which as long as it is in the fire liueth, but if it flie farre from the fire it dieth: The like
report there is of the Salamander, that it extinguisheth the fire, <hi>non alio modo, quam glacies,</hi>
like a peice of yce, <hi>Plin. lib. 10. cap.</hi> 67. so also <hi>Aelianus, lib. 2. cap.</hi> 20. And <hi>Olympiodore</hi>
the philosopher confirmeth the same by his experience, that they which kept fornaces in his
time, would shake the faggots which thy burned, least the Salamanders might be among
them, which by experience they found to put out the fire. <hi>Iamblicus</hi> writeth,<note place="margin">Iamblic. de myster. Egypt.</note> that the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
Prophets, when they were inspired of their gods, could walke through the middes of

called <hi>Hyrpiae,</hi> which in the yearely sacrifice of Apollo, could passe through an heape
of wood, set on fire, and not be burned.</p>
                        <p>2. 1. Concerning those stones giuen in instance, it is like because of their colde
and solid constitution, that they a good while may resist the fire, but at the length, the fire
by the extreame heat thereof will worke vpon them. 2. touching those beasts which are
said to liue in the fire, it must be so vnderstood, that they liue in hoate places, neere vnto the
fire, but not in the flames, as those little creatures which we call crickits, doe keepe altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in ouens, and chimnies, and other hoate places, but they cannot endure the flames of
the fire: and it is <hi>Aristotles</hi> principle,<note place="margin">lib. 2. de genera. animal. c. 3.</note> 
                           <hi>nullum animal nasci, vel viuere posse in igne,</hi> that no
creature can be engendred, or liue in the fire.</p>
                        <p>3. As for the Salamander, by reason of the cold constitution thereof, it may resist the
fire, and somewhat slake the heat of it, as any other thing will, that is extreame cold and
moist; but at the length the fire will consume it: as <hi>Mathiolus</hi> writing vpon <hi>Dioscorides, lib.

                        <p>4. These examples giuen in instance of such as walked through the fire without hurt,
are either not to be credited, as many such fabulous tales are reported by the heathen wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
or els such things were done by the operation of Sathan: who either by slaking the
force of the fire, or by suborning some imagined fire, or by interposing some cold bodie, or
by some like meanes, can worke such feates. So then it remaineth a strong and firme conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,

                        <p>1. There are three things required to make a Martyr, the goodnesse of the cause, the

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:18834:56"/>
the cause was for the maintenance of Gods glorie, the danger of death was present, and
without Gods miraculous deliuerance ineuitable, and their resolution was constant to die.
This testimonie <hi>Cyprian</hi> giueth of these martyrs, and of Daniel, who escaped the lyons: <hi>In

                        <p>1. If God should doe so ordinarily, then the miracle should not seeme so great, not the
power and glorie of God so much thereby aduanced.</p>
                        <p>2. It is in God hand, and in his choice, whether to deliuer his Saints from temporall

                        <p>3. God doth send temporall deliuerance to such instruments, as he purposeth still to vse

Gods glorie among the Chaldeans: but when any hath finished their course, and accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                        <head>Quest. 34. vers. 25. In what sense the king saith, that the
fourth was like the sonne of God.</head>
                        <p>1. Some thinke that the king imagined, that the fourth was like the sonne of God, that
is, was one of the inferiour or second sort of gods: for the Gentiles thought, that the gods
begat children of women, as Iupiter had Hercules and Apollo, and these were called <hi>semidei,</hi>
halfe gods: this opinion is mentioned by <hi>Dyonis. Carthusian.</hi> and so <hi>Osiander</hi> saith, that the
king thought, that the gods had sent, <hi>quendam ex minoribus dijs,</hi> some one of the lesse or
inferiour gods. But this sperstitious and impious conceit of their <hi>halfe gods,</hi> was afterward
taken vp by the Greekes, it was not at this time currant among the Babylonians: whose
chiefe God Bel was, and next to him they adored and worshipped the Sunne and the starres.</p>
                        <p>2. Some doe indeede take this to be vnderstood of an Angel, as <hi>Hierome, Angeli filij Dei
nuncupantur,</hi> the Angels are called the sonnes of God: as Iob: 1. 6. and psal. 89. 7. so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<hi>Calv. Perer. Polan.</hi> and their reason is, because the king afterward saith, that God had
sent his Angel, v. 28. But 1. it is not vnvsuall in Scripture, for the sonne of God to be called an
Angel, as Malach. 3. 1. the Angel of the couenant. 2. and though this phrase be vsed in
Scripture, to call the Angels the sonnes of God, yet it may be doubted, whether the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
vsed so to speake. 3. And though the king might take him to be an Angel, yet the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
is, whether he were an Angel, or indeede the sonne of God.</p>
                        <p>3. Some adde further, that this was an Angel, but likened to the sonne of God, because
he was a type of the incarnation of the sonne of God: that the sonne of God should descend
from heauen, <hi>suos è peccatorum flammis erepturus,</hi> to deliuer his out of the flames of their
sinnes: <hi>Pintus,</hi> and before him <hi>Apollinarius.</hi> But although this typicall application may be
made of it, yet Nebuchadnezzàr beeing vtterly ignorant of the mysterie of redemption,
could not so vnderstand it.</p>
                        <p>4. Some doe thinke that Nebuchadnezzar meaneth Christ the sonne of God: and this
opinion is deuided: some take it, that Nebuchadnezzar had learned the mysterie of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation
of the Sonne of God of Daniel, as it was in some sort declared vnto him, in the
interpretation of his dreame, <hi>Pintus.</hi> But Nebuchadnezzars grosse superstition and idolatrie,
euidently sheweth, that he had no such knowledge of Christ to come, <hi>Rupertus</hi> thinketh,
that <hi>mente non sua locutus est,</hi> Nebuchadnezzar spake he knewe not what, as Saul and Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas
prophesied: and addeth further, that it pleased God by the mouth of an heathen man,
to reueale this mysterie, <hi>non enim tutum erat, aeternam filij ex patre Dei generationem Iudaeis
carnalibus enuntiare,</hi> for it was not safe to declare vnto the carnall Iewes, the eternall gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Sonne from God the father, <hi>Rupertus ibid.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But 1. it is euident by the text, that Nebuchadnezzar knew what he said, calling him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
an Angel, whom here he saith, was like to the Son of God. 2. and the mysterie of the
Trinitie, and of the incarnation of Christ, could not be more strange no not to the carnall
Iewes (among whom notwithstanding were many beleeuers) then vnto the Gentiles.</p>
                        <p>5. Some take it, that this was but a phrase of speach to liken him to the sonne of God,
that is some excellent person, as excellent and eminent things are so named; as the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of God, the armie of God; that is, a great mountaine, a great armie, <hi>Perer.</hi> as <hi>Homer</hi>
called such <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, like vnto God, or borne of God, <hi>Iun.</hi> he sawe in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of the fourth, <hi>supra vultus humani splendorem radiare aliquid,</hi> something to shine
beyond the brightenesse of mans countenance, <hi>Hug. Car.</hi> so also <hi>Lyranus.</hi> This is true, but
not all.</p>
                        <p>6. Therefore these two things may be safely here affirmed, 1. that Nebuchadnezzar here
in this saying determineth not what manner of person it should be, whether God, or an
Angel precisely, but in generall, that it was some diuine presence. 2. yet in truth and in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
deede it was Christ the sonne of God, who appeared at this time in humane shape, and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:18834:57"/>
came to deliuer his seruants: As <hi>Rupertus</hi> thereof yeeldeth this reason, it was a signe of that
which the Sonne of God was to doe in his Church; <hi>quando enim non adfuit filius Dei agoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zantibus?</hi>
for when was not the Sonne of God present with his seruants in their agonies?
&amp;c. This application is better then that of <hi>Lyranus,</hi> who also vnderstandeth that this was
Christ the Sonne of God, but would haue thereby prefigured Christs descension into hell,
<hi>vbi animae sanctorum tenebantur, &amp;c.</hi> where the soules of the saints were held, but not burnt,
that they might be deliuered, &amp;c. But this is newe and strange doctrine, that any in the
flames of hell should be deliuered, or that the flames of hell should not burne: of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
also are <hi>Pellican,</hi> and <hi>Osiander,</hi> that this was Christ the sonne of God, their reason is,
because he often before appeared to Abraham, and Moses, and other Patriarches and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
<hi>assumpta humana forma,</hi> assuming humane shape.</p>

                        <head>Quest. 35. Of the apparition of Angels in humane shape,
what manner of bodies they appeared in.</head>
                        <p>Because the opinion of the most is, that this was an Angel, which was here seene in the
middes of the fornace by Nebuchadnezzar, it shall not be amisse to insert something of their
manner of apparition.</p>
                        <p>1. That Angels, yea and the sonne of God himselfe sometime appeared visibly vnto men,
though in their nature they are invisible spirits, it is most euident by the manifold visions and
apparitions, which were shewed vnto the Patriarches, and Prophets, so that this needeth no
further proofe.</p>
                        <p>2. They appeared not in shewe onely, as it were in imaginarie, and fantasticall bodies, as
<hi>Marcion</hi> held, whom <hi>Tertullian</hi> confuteth, but in verie sensible and palpable bodies, which
might be felt, handled, and touched: such bodies had those Angels, which came vnto Lot.</p>
                        <p>3. Nor yet were their bodies taken out of any celestiall matter, such as the starres are
made of, which was the fansie of <hi>Apelles,</hi> whom <hi>Tertullian</hi> confuteth, <hi>lib. de carne Christ.</hi>
but rather they consisted of some terrene matter, because their bodies were palbable, and
they did eate and drinke.</p>
                        <p>4. Neither were these the proper bodies of Angels, which are of a spirituall nature: we
must not thinke, <hi>Angelos propriam carnem gestasse,</hi> that the Angels did beare their owne
flesh, neither was it hypostatically vnited vnto them, as part of their person, but as <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi>
saith, <hi>tanquam vestes sumebant &amp; dep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>nebant,</hi> they did assume them, and lay them
downe againe as garments.</p>
                        <p>5. Great difference there was betweene the bodies, wherein the Angels appeared, and
the bodie which Christ walked in: for this bodie Christ tooke by birth; so did not the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
as <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith, <hi>non venerant mori, ideo nec nasci,</hi> they came not to die, therefore
they needed not to be borne.</p>
                        <p>6. And some difference there was betweene the bodies, which the Angels assumed, and
wherein Christ manifested himselfe in the olde testament: for Christ made vnto him a bodie
for the time of nothing, and layd it downe againe, as it pleased him: but the Angels could
not make their bodies, but they were prepared of God, either of nothing, or out of some
preexistent matter: but this beginning rather their bodies had, the other of nothing was
Christs: <hi>Tertullian</hi> then hath here a bold assertion,<note place="margin">lib. 3. aduers. Marcion.</note> 
                           <hi>proprium esse Angelicae potestatis, ex nulla
materia sibi corpus sumere,</hi> that it is proper vnto the Angelicall power to take vnto them a
bodie of no matter, &amp;c. but this power belongeth onely to the creator.</p>
                        <p>7. Now these bodies, if they were made of nothing, they were annihilated againe; if out
of some matter, they were resolued againe into it, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith, <hi>corpus Angelorum ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem

humane shape.</head>
                        <p>1. One reason is, because of all sensible and visible creatures none commeth neerer the
nature of Angels, then man, and therefore Angels haue assumed vnto themselues the shape
of man. 2. If the Angels should in any other forme haue appeared, vsing the speach of man,
it would haue seemed monstrous. 3. And by this the Angels did testifie their loue vnto
man, <hi>similitudo conciliat amorem,</hi> for likenesse of things begetteth loue. 4. Because Angels
doe count men their fellowe seruants: they propound vnto them both the same ende, euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting

glorie in heauen: they are both vnder the same head Christ. 5. the Angels did so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
for the honour of Christs incarnation, who they knewe, should take our nature vpon
him: they therefore by this meanes did dignifie the nature of man. 6. Beside, the parts of

the eyes their knowledge, the hands their ministerie, the feete their readines and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilitie,

                        <p>Nebuchadnezzars conuersion appeareth both by his religious actions toward God, and
by his thankefull rewarding of his seruants, ver. 30.</p>
                        <p>1. His religious actes consist. 1. in his confession of the praise of God. 2. in the decree
which he made concerning the name and worship of God.</p>
                        <p>1. Gods praise is set forth: both by his owne worke in the deliuering of his seruants, by
sending his Angel; and by the constancie of his seruants, set forth by two effects, in that they
refused to obey the kings commandement, and because they did rather chose to giue their
bodies to the fire, then to worship any sauing the Lord.</p>
                        <p>2. In the decree, there is first expressed the offence, if any should blaspheme the name
of God: then the punishment, which is twofold, vpon their bodies, they shall be drawne

                        <p>1. <hi>Pererius</hi> thinketh that Nebuchadnezzar was truely and indeede conuerted, which he
would prooue by the effects thereof, namely these fower. 1. the confession of his error. 2.
the aduancing of true religion. 3. the exalting of those that feared God. 4. and seuere pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
of all blasphemers and enemies vnto God. But these were temporarie effects, they
continued not, they were therefore no signes of a true conuersion.</p>
                        <p>2. The truer opinion then is, that Nebuchadnezzar was but mooued and affected for a
time, by the strangenesse of this miracle, he was not truely conuerted. 1. As were the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of his faith, such was his faith; but the effects were but temporarie, they lasted but a
while, for presently after in the next chapter, he seeketh againe vnto his sorcerers, for the
interpretation of his dreame, <hi>Iun.</hi> 2. he could haue no true faith, because he had no true
knowledge of God, seeing in the same houre as it were, a little before, he had commanded
the golden image to be worshipped. 3. <hi>permiscuit idola sua vero Deo,</hi> he did ioyne his i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols
with the true God, <hi>Calvin.</hi> yet some thinke that he not long after caused the image to
be pulled downe, <hi>Osiander.</hi> It is more like he did not, because he continued in his old super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition,
in beeing addicted still to his enchanters, and sorcerers. 4. here was onely a naked
miracle, which is but a preparatiue vnto faith, here was no doctrine or instruction out of the
word of God, whereby faith is begotten in vs, <hi>Caluin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. But <hi>Rupertus,</hi> although his opinion be right,<note place="margin">lib. 6. de victor. verb. c. 23.</note> that this confession of Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,
was <hi>tota respersa fermento tumidae vanitatis,</hi> besprinckled with the leauen of swelling
vanitie: yet his reason is not good, because he saith, <hi>placuit mihi,</hi> it pleased me to declare
the signes, which God had wrought, <hi>apud me,</hi> with me, as though he should haue said, <hi>nisi
ob gratiam mei,</hi> he did them onely for my cause, whereas they were wrought against him.
<hi>Contra.</hi> 1. the words well interpreted are, <hi>it became me,</hi> not it pleased me. 2. And these
miracles and signes were wrought toward him or with him, because he was thereby brought
to acknowledge and confesse his error, and to giue the praise vnto God.</p>
                        <p>4. But <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> goeth yet further, and giueth such commendation of this confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

a God of Gods, and the Lord of kings, and yet after that he made the image.</p>
                        <p>5. Yet on the other side, are we farre from the opinion of <hi>Apollinarius,</hi> that the king
<hi>regio fastu condiderit hanc legem, &amp;c.</hi> of princely pride and vanitie did make this lawe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

for the time they were in truth: for if the king had sought his pompe, he would not in

following the <hi>Septuag.</hi> so also <hi>Pererius,</hi> doe make these three last verses part of the third

the Lord had humbled him, and depriued him of his vnderstanding, and afterward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
him againe, as it followeth in the next chapter: the reasons for proofe herof are these.</p>
                        <p>1. Because the style and manner of writing in the first person, the epistle beginneth thus,
<hi>Nabuchadnezzer king, To all people, &amp;c.</hi> and v. 32. <hi>I thought it good:</hi> agreeth with the first
words of the next chapter, <hi>I Nabuchadnezzer, &amp;c.</hi> 2. He intendeth to declare the signes
and wonders, which God wrought toward him, such as specially concerned him, and none
did more particularly touch him, then his transformation into the life of a bruit beast. 3. If
this epistle should not haue coherence with the narration following, it should be much
imperfect: for he saith, <hi>I thought good to declare the signes and wonders:</hi> and yet he declareth
none, if this epistle should not haue relation to the next chapter: Seeing then that these 3.
last verses are a part of that chapter, the questions here arising, shall be there handled.</p>

the Chaldeans were the first that gaue counsell to the king to make this image, to entrappe

whome they called a diuine Spirit, and as it were the soule of the world. And it is said of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle,</hi>

                        <p>1. Because they saw, that in a Commonwealth the Monarchicall state was the best: in a
kingdome one Prince, in an armie one generall, in a shippe one gouernor, in a beehiue one
master-bee: so in the world there is one chiefe Ruler and moouer of all things.</p>
                        <p>2. God is an infinite spirit: but one infinite thing can not stand with an other.</p>
                        <p>3. God is loue, vnitie, concord: but where many gods are, there is varietie, not vnitie, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,

the Israelites, because they digged vnto them pits, which could hold no water. 2. They
offend, <hi>quando colitur Deus, sed non solus,</hi> when God is worshipped, but not onely: as the
Israelites in Elias time serued God and Baal together, which he calleth, an halting betweene

they be not adored.</head>
                        <p>1. <hi>Pappus</hi> here maketh 3. kinde of Images: some were set vp for idolatrie, and these he
would haue remooued: there are two other kind: some doe set forth the histories of the old
and new Testament, some are onely for ornament in Churches: neither of these are prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
as euidently appeareth by the building both of Moses Tabernacle, and of Salomons
Temple: but here it is the part of the Minister to admonish the people to take heede of ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie:
so he concludeth that the vse of Images in it selfe is to be counted among indifferent
things.</p>
                        <p>2. 1. This distinction of images and pictures, as some were set vp for superstition, some
are for historie, some for ornament, we greatly mislike not: but if he graunt, that all images
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:18834:60"/>
set vp for idolatrie ought to be demolished, then all such likewise, which may be abused to
idolatrie; as all carued and grauen images are of that kind. 2. Such kind of images, which
are carued and fashioned with proportion, and not painted onely and pictured, serue not at
all for historie: therefore by that pretext they cannot be excused. 3. And though there may
be an outward comelines to the eye, in the gilding and garnishing of images; yet such come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines
must serue vnto edifying: but if offence rather and occasion be feared thereby, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
comelines and decencie is more to be respected, then the seemelines of the obiect to
the eye. 4. It is a more compendious way to remooue the stumbling blocke, then to put it
before the feete, and then bid men to take heed of it: so it were better to take away the very
occasion of idolatrie, then it remaining to warne the people to take heed. 5. And the vse of
images for religion is no indifferent thing: as the very place doth show, that images set vp in
Churches, haue a certaine religious respect. 6. Lastly the Apostles saying, <hi>Babes keepe your
selues from idols,</hi> 1. Ioh. 5. 21. doth not onely will them to take heed of idolatrie, but euen to
shunne the occasion, and to remooue the stumbling blocke.</p>

                        <p>1. As here this image is set vp by the authoritie of the king: so the Romanists doe by
the authoritie of Princes get the adoration of images commanded.</p>
                        <p>2. He causeth it to be made of gold, that it might allure them the more: and so the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
doe adorne their images and Temples with gold.</p>
                        <p>3. The image is made of an huge bignes, that it might be the more admired for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
thereof: so in the Popish Churches they haue their Crucifixes made of great proportion,
and other images, as of S. Christopher, that they might draw the eies of the people vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Nabuchadnezzer</hi> maketh choice also of a conuenient place, in a great plaine: and the
Romanists thinke to grace their images by the place, setting them vp in Churches and
Churchyards, in crosses and high waies.</p>
                        <p>5. The king hath here the consent of all his nobles for the setting vp of this image: so
was it a decree among the Romanes, that no god should be consecrated of the Emperour,
vnlesse the Senate approoued it: and therefore when Tiberius mooued that Christ should
be receiued into the number of the gods, because the Senate would not consent, it was not
done: hereupon <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith, <hi>nisi homini Deus placuerit, Deus non erit,</hi> vnlesse God be
pleasing vnto man, he shall not be God. After this manner the Papists doe vrge consent and
agreement, of all states among them, of Princes, Dukes, Nobles, Cardinals, Bishops.</p>
                        <p>6. Here was a bloodie decree made against those, that would not worship this image,
they are threatned the fierie fornace: So in the persecution vnder the Romane Emperours,
the Christians were put to vnspeakable torments, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> describeth,<note place="margin">Apologet. c. 12.</note> 
                           <hi>crucibus &amp; stipiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus

their sides with clawes and nayles, &amp;c. we are cast vnto beasts, burnt with fire, &amp;c. Euen these
also are the engines and instruments wherewith the Papists persecute the seruants of Christ,
the fire and sword.</p>
                        <p>7. This idolatrous seruice of the Image is set forth with all kind of varietie of musicke,
to affect the minds of the simple, and to stirre vp their superstitious affections: So among the
Romanists their seruice is attended vpon with instruments of musicke, which make a dumb
sound, nothing beeing vnderstood that is sung or plaied.</p>
                        <p>8. Thus by all these meanes superstition and idolatrie is countenanced by authoritie of
Princes, consent, seueritie of decrees, and such like, and yet preuaileth not; whereas the truth
is naked, hath neither consent, nor authoritie on it side, but all things against it, yet it prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
to make that saying good of the Apostle, <hi>The foolishnes of God is wiser then men, and the
weakenes of God is stronger then men,</hi> 1. Cor. 1. 25.</p>

                        <p>1. It is euident in the titles of diuers Psalmes of Dauid, that they were sung and plaid vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
instruments, which should not haue beene vsed in the Church of God, if they had beene
simply vnlawfull, <hi>Papp.</hi> neither can it be saide, that the vse of such musicall instruments then
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:18834:61"/>
was altogether ceremoniall: for they vsed them as well in their ciuill reioycings, as in their
Ecclesiasticall assemblies: the vse thereof holding still in the one, can not be vtterly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the other. Concerning singing, S. Paul alloweth speaking in hymnes and Psalmes,
and spirituall songs: the Christians, as <hi>Plinius secundus</hi> writ vnto Trajane, had their <hi>antelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canos
hymnos,</hi> their morning songs, which they song before day vnto Christ: <hi>Flavianus</hi> and
<hi>Theodorus</hi> at Antioch, <hi>Basil</hi> in the East Churches, and <hi>Ambrose</hi> at Millaine brought vp the
vse of singing.</p>
                        <p>2. Yet Christians now are not to take the same libertie in these externall parts of Gods
seruice, as the Church of the Iewes did: but as they kept their Sabbath with outward obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations,
much respecting the corporall rest: but Christians now make the outward rest the
least part of the Lords day, consecrating the same chiefly to spirituall exercises: So now the
greatest part of the seruice of God must be spent in spirituall instruction: the other must be
vsed onely as an handmaid.</p>
                        <p>3. These rules then ought to be obserued in Church songs and musicke: 1. that it ought
to be graue and sober, and musicall instruments should so be handled, <hi>vt ad cantus solennes
Ecclesiasticos adhibeantur,</hi> that they be applied vnto the songs of the Church, <hi>non ad vagam
&amp; inanem aurium delectationem,</hi> not for the wandring and vaine delight of the eares, &amp;c.
that all things in the Church may be done to edifying. 2. <hi>Vt non maior pars temporis illis
instrumentis tribuatur, &amp;c.</hi> that the greater part of time should not be giuen vnto those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments

in the outward sound, to imagine that God is pleased and satisfied with such melodie: for
this was the difference betweene the vse of instruments in the Church of God among the
Iewes there, and among the idolatrous Chaldeans: they vsed them as helps of their infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
yet <hi>manebat illud principium, spiritualiter Deum esse colendum,</hi> that principle remained,
that God was spiritually to be worshipped: But the other, <hi>putarunt se Deo satisfecisse,</hi>
thought they had satisfied God, if they did heape together musicall instruments. <hi>Calvin.</hi>
We may then sing and speake in hymnes and psalmes, but we must make a melodie also in
our hearts, Eph. 5. 19. whosoeuer singeth with his voice and not with his heart, mocketh
God, and deceiueth himselfe. This then is the difference betweene religious, and superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
deuotion: true deuotion is first wrought within by the preaching of Gods word, and
then is helped without by such externall meanes: but superstition and blind deuotion first

setled and established: in this case no mixture of contrarie religion is to be admitted:
As diuerse good kings of Iudah are reprooued, because they remoued not the high places:

                        <p>2. If the kingdome be such, as professeth corrupt religion, which cannot be remooued
all at once, then the godly prince intending reformation, must content himselfe to doe, what
he may; and to followe Nebuchadnezzars president, who although idolatrie were not then
abolished, yet prouideth that no iuiurie should be offred vnto true religion, nor blasphemie

cause of his humiliation is described to be God, the materiall cause Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar
himselfe, the formall, it is set downe in the manner of an epistle, the finall cause
is the conuersion of Nebuchadnezzar to Gods glorie, and the comfort of his Church.</p>
                     <p>The Chapter hath two parts. 1. the inscription of the epistle, in the three last verses of
the last chapter, which are rather to be referred vnto this, as is shewed before, cap 3. quest.
40. the order and parts of the inscription are also shewed before, cap. 3. quest. 37.</p>
                     <p>1. The bodie of the epistle consisteth. 1. of the <hi>exordium,</hi> or beginning, describing in
generall, 1. the dreame of the king, who, where, and in what manner he dreamed. 2. the
inquisition for the interpretation thereof, of the wise men, which was frustrate, to ver. 6.</p>
                     <p>2. The narration followeth: where 1. there is the declaration of the dreame to vers. 16.
2. the interpretation thereof, vers. 26. 3. the accomplishment, ver. 26. to the ende.</p>
                     <p>1. In the declaration: there is, 1. the description of the tree, vers. 8. 9. 2. of the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe
of the tree with the manner thereof, ver. 13. 3. the certaintie of it with the end, v. 14.</p>
                     <p>2. In the interpretation. 1. there is the preamble to it, wherein is contained Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzars
request vnto Daniel, v. 15. and Daniels delberate answer after a certaine pause, v. 16.
2. then followeth. 1. the interpretation it selfe, consisting of the exposition, both of the
tree and the beautifull state thereof, vers. 19. then of the ouerthrowe of the same, what is
signified thereby, ver. 20. to vers. 24. 3. the counsell of Daniel to the king, v. 24.</p>
                     <p>3. The accomplishment comprehendeth. 1. the occasion, by the proud words of Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar,
where are expressed, the time, place, and words, which he vttered, 27. 28. 2.
the iudgement. 1. denounced, vers. 28. 29. 2. executed in his humiliation, ver. 30. restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to his humane condition and vnderstanding, 31. and to his kingdome, vers. 33. 3.
the effects are the praising of God, and confessing of his power, ver. 32. 34.</p>

                     <p>2. It seemed good vnto me (<hi>it was meet before me. C. it became me. I. it was my dutie. V.

                     <p>4. I Nebuchadnezzar beeing at rest (<hi>happie. V.</hi>) in mine house, and flourishing, (<hi>like the
spreading boughes. C.</hi>) in my palace.</p>
                     <p>5. I sawe a dreame, which made me afraide, and the thoughts vpon my bed and the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of mine head troubled me.</p>
                     <p>6. Therefore I set forth a decree, to bring before me all the wise men of Babel, to make
knowne vnto me (<hi>to shewe vnto me. caeter.</hi>) the interpretation of the dreame.</p>
                     <p>7. So came the magicians, astrologians, Chaldeans, and Soothsayers, and I told the
dreame before (<hi>to them. G. B.</hi>) but they could not make knowne vnto me the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation

                     <p>8. Till at the last Daniel (<hi>Daniel the collegue. L. S.</hi> but <hi>acharin beeing onely found in this

Belteshazzar, according to the name of my God, which hath the spirit of the holy gods in

                     <p>9. O Belteshazzar, chiefe of the Magicians, because I knowe that the spirit of the holy
gods is in thee, and not any secret puts thee to businesse (<hi>is impossible vnto thee, L.</hi> or <hi>escapeth
thee. V.</hi> or <hi>troubleth thee, G. B.</hi> or <hi>oppresseth thee. I. the word (anas) signifieth to trouble, to put to

he declareth his dreame himselfe) the interpretation thereof.</p>
                     <p>10. Thus <hi>were</hi> the visions (<hi>not vision. L.</hi>) of mine head in my bed: I did behold, and loe
a tree in the middes of the earth, and the height thereof was great.</p>
                     <p>11. A great tree and strong, and the height thereof reached vnto heauen, and the sight
thereof to the ende of all the earth.</p>
                     <p>12. The boughes thereof (<hi>bough. C. the singular is put for the plurall,</hi> not <hi>the leaues there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
L.) were</hi> faire, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meate for all: the beasts of the
field tooke shade, <hi>I. B.</hi> (not <hi>it made shade. G. or the beasts dwelt</hi>) vnder it, and in the boughes
thereof dwelt the foules of heauen, and all flesh fedde of it.</p>
                     <p>13. I sawe in the visions of my head vpon my bed, and behold a watchman, and an holy
one came downe from heauen.</p>
                     <p>14. And cried aloud (<hi>with strength. C.</hi>) and said thus, Hewe downe the tree, and breake
off his branches: shake of his leaues, and scatter his fruite, that the beasts may flee from vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it, and the foules from his branches.</p>
                     <p>15. Neuerthelesse leaue the stumpe (not <hi>the budde</hi>) of his rootes in the earth, and with

<hi>be</hi> among the grasse of the field.</p>
                     <p>16. Let his heart be changed (<hi>let them change. C.</hi>) from a mans (<hi>from a man</hi>) and let a
beasts heart be giuen vnto him, and let seauen times be passed (<hi>changed. L.</hi>) ouer him.</p>
                     <p>17. The sentence <hi>is</hi> according to the decree of the watchmen, and the request according
to the word of the holy ones. <hi>B. I. V.</hi> not, <hi>and the word of the holy ones, and the request, (and)

G. <hi>for this last word is not in the originall</hi>) to the intent that (<hi>vntill. L.</hi>) the liuing may

to whom he will, and appointeth ouer it the most abiect of men.</p>
                     <p>18. This is the dreame that I king Nebuchadnezzar haue seene, now thou Belteshazzar
tell the interpretation thereof: for all the wisemen of my kingdome are not able to make
knowne the interpretation: but thou art able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.</p>
                     <p>19. Then Daniel whose name was Belteshazzar was amazed. <hi>I. (stood as astonished. V.
held his peace. L. B. G. S. but the word (shamam) signifieth properly to be astonished, amazed, to
wonder</hi>) by the space of an houre, and his thoughts troubled him: and the king spake and
said, Let neither the dreame, nor the interpretation thereof trouble thee: then Belteshazzar
answered and said, The dreame <hi>be</hi> to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to
thine enemies.</p>
                     <p>20. The tree which thou sawest, which was great and mightie, whose height reached
vnto the heauen, and the sight thereof through all the earth.</p>
                     <p>21. Whose leaues were faire, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meate for all,
vnder the which the beastes of the field dwelt, and the foules of the heauen did sit.</p>
                     <p>22. It is thou O king, that art great and mightie, for thy greatnesse is growen, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
vnto the heauen, and thy dominion is to the ende of the earth.</p>
                     <p>23. Whereas the king sawe a watchman, and an holy one, that came downe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
and said, Hewe downe the tree, and destroy it, yet leaue the stumpe of the rootes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

                     <p>29. At the ende of twelue moneths, he walked in the palace of the kingdome of Babylon.</p>
                     <p>30. And the king spake and said, Is not this great Babel, that I haue built, for the house
of the kingdome, by the might of my power, and for the honour of my maiestie?</p>
                     <p>31. While the word <hi>was</hi> in the kings mouth (<hi>the word beeing yet in the kings mouth, C. V.
A. I.</hi>) a voice came downe from heauen, <hi>saying,</hi> To thee be it spoken (<hi>they speake, C.</hi>) O king
Nabuchadnezzer, thy kingdome is departed from thee:</p>
                     <p>32. And they shall driue thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beast of the

                     <p>33. The very same houre was this word (<hi>this thing, G. this matter, B.</hi>) fulfilled vpon Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzer,
and he was driuen from men, and did eate grasse as the oxen, and his bodie

<hi>any</hi> that can stay (<hi>resist. L. B.</hi>) his hand, or say vnto him, What doest thou?</p>
                     <p>36. At the same time did mine vnderstanding returne vnto me, and I <hi>returned</hi> to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of my kingdome: my glorie and my beautie was restored (<hi>returned. C.</hi>) vnto me, and my
counsellors and my princes sought vnto me, and I was established in my kingdome, and my

2. the generall argument of the whole epistle. 1. the salutation sheweth, 1. the author and

wonders of God, which are amplified by two adiuncts, of the greatnesse and strength. 2.

2. Further the conquest of Egypt fell out after the 25. yeare of Ieconias captiuitie, Ezec.
29. 17. which was 10. yeare before the ende of Nebuchadnezzars raigne, for in the 37.
yeare of Iechonias captiuitie began <hi>Euilmerodach</hi> the sonne of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> to raigne.</p>
                        <p>3. This fearefull and strange accident then of <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> transmutation, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecting
from his throne, and restoring againe, might fall out some 9. or 10. yeares before
the ende of his raigne, <hi>Perer:</hi> and this epistle might be written two yeares before his death,
<hi>Iun.</hi> for one yeare after this dreame, ver. 26. he was driuen from among men, and liued 7.

                        <head>Quest. 3. How Nebuchadnezzar could write vnto all the people in the world.</head>
                        <p>1. <hi>Caluin</hi> thinketh, that here the king <hi>superbe locutus est,</hi> spake proudly, as making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
Lord of the whole earth: as the Romanes, because they had a large dominion, called
Rome <hi>Dominam totius orbis,</hi> the Ladie of the whole world: so also <hi>Polan.</hi> But that Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar
did not this of any ostentation, may appeare both by the ende of his writing,
which was to set forth the power of Gods kingdome, and by his stile, he contenteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
with one title, calling himselfe king, whereas the Emperours of Rome vsed many swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
titles of their conquests, as <hi>Parthicus, Persicus, Germanicus, &amp;c.</hi> of Parthia, Persia, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mania,
and such like, <hi>Bulling.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. The same author maketh this the reason, because now this epistle, beeing preserued
vnto our times, as the rest of the Scriptures by the spirit of God, is indeed written and made
knowne to all people: but this seemeth not to be the literall and historicall meaning.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Pappus</hi> saith he writte to all people and languages, not onely to those which were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
vnto him, but he was desirous to make knowne the workes of God to all people in the
world So also <hi>Oecolampad.</hi> vnder these nations comprehendeth the South and West parts
of the world, as <hi>Mauritania, Spaine,</hi> for he was known in those parts as <hi>Strabo</hi> writeth, lib.
15. <hi>non enim praecipit, sed hortatur,</hi> for he in this epistle co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth not, but onely exhorteth:
But it is euident by the forme of the decree which he made before, <hi>concerning euerie people,
nation, and language,</hi> where he onely meaneth such nations, as were subiect vnto him: for his
lawe could not bind those which were not subiect: that the inscription of this epistle must be
taken in the same sense.</p>
                        <p>4. Wherefore as R. <hi>Saadiah,</hi> well expoundeth, he vnderstandeth here onely his owne
kingdomes, as of <hi>Persia, Assyria, Egypt,</hi> which are said to be the whole earth: because he
was <hi>monarcha orientis,</hi> the Monarch of the East parts, <hi>Lyra,</hi> which was the most famous and
flourishing part of the earth: the principall part then is taken for the whole, <hi>Geneuens.</hi>

                        <p>1. Some seeme to confound these two signes and wonders, making them all one, as <hi>Oeco.
Osian.</hi> 2. some make this distinction: those are signes, <hi>qua fieri videntur contra naturam, &amp;c.</hi>

<hi>admiratione digna,</hi> worthie of admiration, <hi>Hugo.</hi> but this is no difference at all, for whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
is done aboue or against nature, is worthie of admiration.</p>
                        <p>3. They are thus rather to be distinguished: the same things in diuerse respectes are both
signes and wonders: signes, because many things are thereby signified; and miracles or
wonders, because they are done aboue and beyond nature, <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they are euident testimonies of Gods wisedome, iustice, power: and wonders, because they
were things wonderfull, and indeede to be wondered at, <hi>Polan.</hi> as that Nebuchadnezzar
so mightie a king, should be chased from among men, and liue among bruite beasts seauen
yeares, depriued of humane vnderstanding, and afterward be restored againe: <hi>Lyranus</hi> saith,
they are called signes, because they were done to bring men to repentance: and wonders, as

                        <head>Quest. 5. Whether Nebuchadnezzer were now at the last truely conuerted.</head>
                        <p>1. <hi>Caluin</hi> is of opinion, that for all this, <hi>non exuerit suos errores, Nebuchadnezzar</hi> left
not his errors. But howsoeuer twice before this he was onely astonished and mooued for the
time, &amp; afterward fell againe to his superstitions, yet he was at the length truely humbled.</p>
                        <p>2. I embrace therefore the contrarie opinion of <hi>Bullinger, Ostander, Oecolampadius,</hi> which
thinke that at this time he was truly conuerted vnto God: <hi>Osiander</hi> saith he did declare, <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram
humilitatem,</hi> true humilitie, which was an euident signe and effect of his conuersion.
<hi>Oecolampadius</hi> giueth these two reasons: 1. beeing now called to the true knowledge of
God, <hi>Deicogniti mores imitatur,</hi> he imitateth the properties of God, which is to be gentle,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:18834:65"/>
mercifull, wishing peace vnto all. 2. he exhorteth all men to the knowledge of the true
God, <hi>exemplum meum emendet omnes,</hi> let all men learne to amend by mine example, &amp;c.</p>

                        <head>6. Quest. Of the author of this Epistle.</head>
                        <p>1. The author of the Scholasticall historie denieth that Daniel was the author of this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle,
but was written by Nebuchadnezzer for eternall memorie of this thing, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vnto him: But how should the writing of a prophane king, that was no Prophet come to
be counted Canonicall Scripture, if the Prophet had no hand in it.</p>
                        <p>2. Neither yet doe I thinke with <hi>Calvin,</hi> that <hi>Daniel hic loquitur sub regis persona,</hi> that
Daniel here speaketh (onely) in the person of the king: for the very forme and style of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle,
<hi>Nebuchadnezzer king, to all people, &amp;c. peace be multiplied,</hi> sheweth, that these things
were written by the king, and rehearsed by Daniel.</p>
                        <p>3. Therefore the truth is, that Daniel taketh all this narration, out of the acts and Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles
of the Chaldees, where this epistle was registred, not for more breuitie sake, as <hi>Osian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
least he should be constrained to rehearse the same things often: but rather, that by the
authoritie of the king the truth of this historie might be commended: which would haue
beene suspected, if it had beene penned originally by a Iew, <hi>Polan.</hi> And yet, though it were
first written by a prophane man, that was no Prophet, yet it was approoued by Daniel the
Lords Prophet, <hi>Bulling.</hi> as in the old Testament, not onely those writings are receiued for
Canonicall, which were originally written by the Prophets, but such also, as beeing written
by others, were approoued by the Prophets; as the epistles and decrees of the kings of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia
inserted into the bookes of Ezra and Nehemiah.</p>

                     <div n="7" type="question">
                        <head>7. Quest. Whether this historie contained in this chapter of Nebuchadnezzers
transmutation, were so done in deede.</head>
                        <p>1. <hi>Hierome</hi> here reporteth the opinion of some, which were of the sect of the Origenists,
which thought, that these things set downe of Nebuchadnezzer were not historically done,
but that vnder his fall is prefigured and shadowed forth the fall of Lucifer the deuill from
heauen: their reasons are these.</p>
                        <p>1. In other places of Scripture, as Isa. 14. vnder the fall of <hi>the king of Babylon,</hi> is descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
the fall of Lucifer.</p>
                        <p>2. Diuers things here repeated are impossible, as that a man should be transformed into
a beast: that a king delicately brought vp, should eate grasse like an oxe.</p>
                        <p>3. And all this time of Nebuchadnezzers sauage life, which was 7. yeares, the kingdome
of Babylon was not without a gouernour, who, it is most like, would not haue giuen place
againe to Nebuchadnezzer.</p>
                        <p>4. If any such thing had beene historically done, they which haue written diligently of
the Chaldean affaires, as <hi>Berosus, Megasthenes, Diocles, Philostratus,</hi> would haue made
mention thereof.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. That prophecie of the ruine and fall of the king of Babylon, is by some of
the Fathers typically applied to the fall of Lucifer, yet it was historically fulfilled in the king
of Babylon: But here they would so make this a type of the fall of the Deuill, as that they
take away the truth of the historie: he reason then is not alike.</p>
                        <p>2. It is no strange thing for men beside themselues, depriued of vnderstanding, to liue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
beasts: neither are the other things vnlikely, or impossible, as shall be seene in the seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
handling of them.</p>
                        <p>3. Neither was it an hard thing with God, to cause the gouernment to returne vnto Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzer,
as he saith, v. 33. that his counsellers and Princes sought vnto him. It might
be the kingdome was gouerned by his sonne, or Daniel, which did willingly giue place: <hi>Lyr.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. To the last argument it may be answered diuersly: 1. that it is not necessarie that the
sacred histories should haue the testimonie of forren writers: for the standing still of the
Sunne in Ioshuahs time, and the going backe of the Sunne in Hezekiahs raigne, the storie of
Esther, and many beside, haue not the witnesse of prophane writers. 2. the euidence of this
historie was registred in the Chalde Chronicles, which beeing perished, the memorie of this
fact among the Gentiles was extinguished also. 3. And Gods prouidence is seene herein
that the Gentiles should not put their vncleane fingers to the sacred histories, which they
did much abuse, and corrupt: as it shall suffice to giue inflance onely in <hi>Iustine,</hi> who mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
committeth these errours in historie. 1. that the Iewes had their beginning from
Damascus in Syria. 2. that Damascus raigned in that citie first, and Abraham next
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:18834:65"/>
vnto him. 3. Ioseph he maketh the youngest sonne of Israel, and saith he learned art ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke
in Egypt. 4. Moses he maketh Iosephs sonne. 5. the Israelites he saith were expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Egypt, because of the leprosie. 6. Xerxes king of Persia he thinketh first to haue subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Iewes, whereas an 150. yeares before his time, Nebuchadnezzer conquered them.</p>
                        <p>4. The Gentiles also might be afraid to meddle with the sacred stories of the Iewes, as
<hi>Demetrius Phaelereus</hi> answered <hi>Ptolome Philadelphus</hi> (whome he had set ouer the great li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brarie
of Alexandria) beeing terrified by the examples of <hi>Theopompus,</hi> and <hi>Theodectes,</hi> who
attempting to insert the Iewish histories into their writings, the one was stricken with mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
the other with blindnes, as <hi>Iosep. l. 11. antiq.</hi> and <hi>Eus. l. 8. de praep. Evang.</hi> doe testifie.</p>
                        <p>5. Neither are the Gentile writers altogether silent in this matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for <hi>Alpheus</hi> an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Greeke writer (as <hi>Eusebius</hi> writeth, <hi>lib. 9. c. vlt.</hi>) maketh mention how Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer,
as it were, rauished vpon a suddaine in his minde, told the Chaldeans, that there was a
calamitie approaching, which Bel their god could not preuent; that <hi>Persa semiasinu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </p>
                        <p>2. But that this was a true historie, and not done in figure, type, or vision, it may thus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare:
1. if this be no historie, no more should the rest be, written in this booke, and so we
should haue no certentie of any thing. 2. Daniel himselfe rehearseth this as a matter of fact
before Balthazar, how Nebuchadnezzer was deposed, c. 5. 20. 3. there are many things in
this chapter, which can in no wise agree vnto the deuill: as how Nebuchadnezzer dreamed,
and asked counsell of the wise men: and Daniel wisheth him to breake off his sinnes by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance:
none of these things can be said of the deuill. <hi>ex Perer.</hi>

                        <p>1. <hi>Dorotheus in synops.</hi> and <hi>Epiphan. lib. de vit. &amp; interit. prophet.</hi> doe thinke that Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
was so called after the name of Balthazar the kings sonne, because he purposed to make
him heire with him of the kingdome. And this opinion may seeme somewhat to be fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the vulgar Latin translation: which readeth, v. 5. till Daniel, <hi>collega</hi> (my collegue or
companion in the kingdome) came in: which <hi>Pererius</hi> vnderstandeth so to be saide, because
Nebuchadnezzer had ioyned Daniel with him, as his fellow in the kingdome. <hi>Contra.</hi> 1.
There is no word of that sense, to signifie a collegue or fellow, in the originall, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we will not insist vpon this reason. 2. But the name of Belteshazzar, and Belshazar are
diuers in the the originall: the one consisteth of 7. letters, <hi>Beltheshaatzer,</hi> the other onely of
sixe, <hi>Belshazzer.</hi> And Daniel was so called before this time, when as Balthazar the king was
not yet borne, nor named in storie.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Suidas</hi> and <hi>Iosephus</hi> thinke, that Daniel was so called because of the interpretation of
hid and secret things: but that is not so: for he was thus called before he had yet expounded
any of the kings dreames, c. 1. 7.</p>
                        <p>3. The most thinke, that this was the name of the god of the Chaldees, and giuen vnto
Daniel because of his diuine wisdome, <hi>Lyran. Hugo. Vatab.</hi> but the name of the Chalde
god, was Bel, Isa. 46. 1. not <hi>Belteshazzar.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. Therefore Daniel had not the very name of his god: but the king saith, he was called
after or according to my God: the first syllable onely is borrowed from the name of his god
<hi>Bel:</hi> the whole name consisteth of three Babylonian words, signifying <hi>keeping,</hi> or laying vp
the treasure of Bel, <hi>Iun.</hi> as is shewed before, qu. 28. c. 1.</p>

                        <head>10. Quest. Of Nebuchadnezzers dreame, and the
summe thereof.</head>
                        <p>There are two parts of his dreame, the first containeth a description of a goodly faire tree,
v. 7. to v. 10. the second the ouerthrow and cutting downe of this tree, thence to v. 15.</p>
                        <p>1. The tree is described, 1. by the situation of it in the middes of the earth. 2. by the
height, which reached vnto heauen, which <hi>Theodoret</hi> expoundeth of his pride, so also <hi>gloss.
ordin. Lyranus,</hi> of his high aduancement to such a great Monarchie. 3. by the spreading of
it to the endes of the earth, is vnderstood the largenes of his dominion, which extended very
farre. <hi>Megasthenes,</hi> as Iosephus citeth him, thinketh, that he subdued part of Spaine. 4. by
the vtilitie thereof, which was double, it gaue meate and shadow vnto all both foules and
beasts: that is, all kind of people, both of ciuill and vnciuill life, both had nourishment and
peace vnder the raigne of Nabuchadnezzer.</p>
                        <p>2. Then the destruction of this tree followeth. 1. by whome, by a watchman, which is
interpreted to be an angel. 2. the manner is described how this tree should be serued, <hi>the
tree is broken downe,</hi> that is, the king is cast out of his kingdome; <hi>the branches are broken off,</hi>
his nobles and princes are remooued from him: <hi>his leaues are shaken off,</hi> his glorie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne
is taken from him: <hi>the fruit are scattered,</hi> the riches of the kingdome euery one
snatcheth and diuideth: <hi>the birds and beasts flie away,</hi> many taking occasion by the fall of
the king, withdraw themselues from his yoake.</p>
                        <p>3. Then followeth the limitation and qualifying of the punishment of this tree, a stumpe
of it shall be left, (that is, his kingdome shall be reserued for him still, <hi>gloss. interlin.</hi>) with
the condition thereof; set forth first metaphorically, it shall be bound with chaines of
brasse, whereby is signified his phrensie and madnesse: because mad men are bound with
chaines, <hi>Bulling.</hi> then literally or historically his state is described both outward, that he
should liue with the beasts of the field, and inward, his heart should be changed, which is
amplified by the circumstance of time, till 7. times, <hi>that is yeares be passed ouer him,</hi> v. 13. So
this dreame was propounded in allegorie in such maner, <hi>vt tamen Deus aliquid permiscuerit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
vnde colligeret aliud notari,</hi> that yet God mingled withall some thing, whereout he might
gather, that some other thing was signified, <hi>Calvin.</hi> for a tree, from whence he borrowed
this allegorie, needed not to be bound with chaines, neither hath any heart.</p>
                        <p>5. Lastly, the certentie of this decree is set downe, by a generall consent of God, and his
Angels, v. 14.</p>

                        <head>11. Quest. Why this tree is said to be in the middes

                        <p>1. <hi>Hugo Card.</hi> thinketh it to be so said, because Nebuchadnezzer had Iudea subiect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, which is thought to be in the middes of the earth.</p>
                        <p>2. Some of the <hi>Rabbins</hi> thinke, that Babylon is signified, because it is in the same line or
parallel with Ierusalem, which is in the middes of the earth. And of this opinion are <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi>
and <hi>Origen:</hi> but now no such thing is found, that Ierusalem should be in the middes of

                        <p>3. <hi>Alfragane,</hi> with whome <hi>Pintus</hi> consenteth, thinketh that Babylon it selfe is situate in

this is too curious.</p>
                        <p>4. By the middes of the earth, is better vnderstood the middes of his kingdome, <hi>Osiand.</hi>
so that this is spoken, not in respect of the situation of the place, as of the qualitie &amp; strength

                        <head>12. Quest. Why Nebuchadnezzer is compared to a tree.</head>
                        <p>v. 8. <hi>A great tree and strong. 1. Hierome</hi> seemeth to be here of opinion, that the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
specially in Scripture are compared to trees, as <hi>Nebuchadnezzer</hi> here, and he alleadgeth
that place, Psal. 37. 35. <hi>I haue seene the wicked strong, and spreading himselfe like a greene bay
tree:</hi> But it is euident, that the righteous are also compared to fruitfull trees, Psal. 1. 3.</p>
                        <p>2. Generally a man is likened to a tree, as Ezek. 17. 24. <hi>All the trees of the field shall
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:18834:66"/>
know, that I the Lord, haue brought downe the high tree, &amp;c.</hi> that is, all the people of the
world shall know: a good man is resembled to a good tree, and an euill man to an euill tree,
Matth. 7. 17. <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and before him <hi>Plato,</hi> did call a man, <hi>arborem inuersam,</hi> a tree tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vpside downe: that as the tree hath his roote and sprigges comming out below, so man
hath his head and haire vppermost. Wicked men are like vnto corrupt trees without fruit,
Iud. 12. such as the figgetree was, Matth. 21. which had leaues; but no fruit: good men are
like vnto good trees, Ierem. 17. 8. for like as a tree bringeth forth fruit, not onely as an orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to it selfe, but to be commodious to others: so the righteous are fruitfull vnto many:
and as a tree the deeper it rooteth downeward, the higher it spreadeth vpward; so the more
lowly a man is in his owne eyes, the more he is exalted before God. <hi>Pint.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. Now as men are compared vnto trees in generall, so Princes and great men, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
and set forth by high and tall trees, as Ezek. 17. 12. Zedekiah king of Iudah is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to an high cedar: so the king of Asshur is said to be like <hi>a cedar in Lebanon</hi> with faire
branches, Ezek. 31. 3.</p>
                        <p>4. But in that Nebuchadnezzer is here thus resembled to a goodly great tree, thereby is
not signified the perfection of his gouernment, and his princely vertues: for euen Tyrants
and euill gouernours are as trees, whose gouernment, as a shadow, bringeth some comfort
vnto their subiects: for better is a bad gouernment, then none. <hi>Calvin.</hi>

                        <p>1. Some by the beasts vnderstand simple men, by the foules, <hi>garrulos &amp; mendaces,</hi> prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
and lyers, such as aspired and looked high. <hi>gloss.</hi> Some by the one meane such as were
rude and barbarous, by the other, such as were of most ciuill life, <hi>Perer.</hi> Others by the beasts
interpret them of inferiour sort and condition, by the foules, the more noble sort, which
dwelt in the branches of this tree, in the cities and townes. <hi>Hug. Card.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. But by these two kinds in generall are signified all the inhabitants and subiects in his
kingdome: as Ezek. 39. 17. <hi>Speake vnto euery feathered foule, and to all the beasts of the field,
assemble your selues, and come:</hi> good men, are compared vnto sheepe for their innocencie, to
serpents for their wisdome, and euill men for their crueltie to lyons, and beares, for their
craft vnto foxes, as our Sauiour saith of Herod, <hi>Tell that foxe:</hi> so likewise the righteous are
likened to doues for their simplicitie, and cruell men and oppressors are as rauening eagles,
Ezek. 17. 4. So it is an vsuall thing for men to be compared vnto such beasts and foules,
<hi>quorum mores imitantur,</hi> whose manners and conditions they imitate. And this some thinke
was <hi>Pythagoras</hi> meaning, that held the transmigration of humane soules into the bodies of
beasts. And so <hi>Iamblicus</hi> vnderstandeth it of the similitude and likenes of bruitish manners,
though <hi>Plotinus</hi> absurdly thinke the contrarie, that the soules of men doe in deede passe into
the bodies of beasts: But <hi>Hermes Trismegistus</hi> sheweth the absurditie hereof, thus resoluing,
<hi>non permittere legem diuinam animi humani transitum in bestias,</hi> that the diuine law will not
admit the passage of humane soules into beasts. <hi>ex Pint.</hi>

brasse.</head>
                        <p>1. <hi>Pererius</hi> thinketh in deede that he was first bound with chaines and fetters as a mad
man, and afterward let loose, and so wandred vp and downe among bruit beasts: so also <hi>Osi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
thinketh he was tied with chaines, least he should haue hurt himselfe and others: but
if this were meant literally, then he remained still tied among the grasse and beasts of the
field, as the words are.</p>
                        <p>2. They which take exception to this historie, taking it to be an allegorie, doe make this
one of their obiections, Why they did not rather tie him vp, beeing beside himselfe, then suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
him to range abroad: and how he could liue 7. yeares among bruit beasts, and not be
slaine? <hi>Lyranus</hi> answereth, 1. that if he had beene chained vp, <hi>infirmitas fuisset aggrauata,</hi>
his infirmitie or maladie would haue beene more grieuous, as we see by experience, that
mad men beeing tied vp, are more furious. 2. to the which it may be added, that they did
euen in this time of madnes shew some reuerence toward the person of the king.</p>
                        <p>3. But the best answer is, that they left him to himselfe, that this prophesie of Daniel
might take place: they knew he should be restored to his kingdome againe: and so he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
by the diuine prouidence, preserued and kept from the rage and violence of the beasts.</p>

4. This phrase then, to be tied vp in chains, is here vsed to expresse his madnes: because it
is the vse to bind mad men in chaines, <hi>Bulling.</hi> and hereby is signified the certentie of this
punishment decreed by the sentence of God, which can not be broken, <hi>Lyran.</hi> so that the
meaning is, <hi>stet inter gramina tanquam vinctus catenis ferreis,</hi> he should continue in this
sauage life in the grasse, as one bound with iron fetters, <hi>Oecolamp. Pellican.</hi> he should haue no

                        <p>1. It is vsuall with the Prophets to deliuer their prophecies in this manner, as Isa. 2. 10.
<hi>Enter into the rocke, and hide thee in the dust:</hi> for thou shalt enter and hide thee: so Isa. 13. 6.

                        <p>2. There may be an other reason yeelded in this place: this speech of the Angel, <hi>hewe
downe,</hi> sheweth a generall consent of all the Angels, one encouraging an other to effect and
execute the decree of God, and therefore it is called, v. 14. the decree of the watchmen, that
is, a ioynt consent of all the Angels: And, <hi>postulat ab hominibus fieri, quod Deus imperat,</hi> he
desireth that, what God hath commanded, may accordingly be performed by men. <hi>Iun.</hi>

                        <head>16. Quest. v. 14. Why the Angels are called

                        <p>1. The Angels are so called, because of their spirituall, and incorporeall nature, <hi>Ab. Ezr.</hi>
for bodies onely neede sleepe: and because they haue no bodies, and so neither eate nor
drinke, which are the causes of sleepe, they are alwaies watchfull, <hi>Calv. quia homines labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
&amp; fatigantur, somno egent, &amp;c.</hi> because men doe labour and are wearied, they neede
sleepe: therefore the Angels, which labour not as man, neither are wearied, are free from
sleepe. <hi>Perer.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. And by this word is not onely expressed the spirituall nature of Angels, but their
watchfull office also: they doe alwaies waite and attend vpon God to fulfill his will: as the
Prophet Dauid setteth them forth, Psal. 103. 20. <hi>Praise the Lord ye his Angels, which excell
in strength, that doe his commandement in obeying the voice of his will:</hi> in which sense, they

                        <p>3. But because euill angels are watchfull also,<note place="margin">1. Pet 5. 8.</note> as S. Peter saith, <hi>The deuill goeth about like

Gods decree might take place, and that the sentence giuen by God in heauen, might be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted

                        <p>1. <hi>Lyranus</hi> thinketh, that this is to be vnderstood of Christ, who was humbled, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>based

                        <p>2. <hi>Lyranus</hi> also hath an other exposition, that hereby is signified, that Nebuchadnezzar

a king, men might learne, that all kingdomes are at Gods disposing, seeing many times most

space of an houre.</head>
                        <p>Diuerse reasons may be yeelded of this silence of Daniel. 1. Some thinke that in this
space Daniel praied vnto God for the interpretation of the dreame: as <hi>Theodoret</hi> saith, <hi>prime
ostendenda erat humana infirmitas, &amp;c. first humane infirmitie was to shewe it selfe, and then
inspired grace to be manifested, &amp;c.</hi> so thinketh <hi>Dyonis. Carthusi. intra hanc horam fuisse ei
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:18834:68"/>
ostensam, &amp;c.</hi> that in this space was shewed vnto him the interpretation of the dreame: <hi>se to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum

orauit, &amp;c.</hi> he earnestly besought the Lord. <hi>Bulling.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. But this seemeth not to haue beene all the cause: for it is said <hi>Daniels thoughts trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
him:</hi> not because he was afraide of the king, <hi>
                              <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

iudgements were denounced, <hi>deinde intrepide pronuntiabant,</hi> yet they pronounced them
without feare, <hi>Caluin.</hi> And this seemeth to haue beene the cause of this pause which he
made, the greatnesse of the iudgement which was determined, and for that it greiued him
for the king, of whom he had beene so honoured, because the king encourageth him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede,
whatsoeuer the dreame was.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Vtilis etiam fuit regiscunctatio, &amp;c.</hi> and in this behalfe also this stay of Daniel was
profitable to the king, that he might be more desirous to heare the truth, <hi>Oecolampaid. Pelli.</hi>

                        <head>Quest. 21. v. 16. In what sense Daniel wisheth this dreame
to the kings enemies.</head>
                        <p>Daniel should seeme herein to pray against the will of God, which had so decreed against
Nebuchednezzar, and beside it might be thought against charitie, to wish such things vnto
those, whome he knewe not, who might some of them be better then <hi>Nebuchadnezzar.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Some thinke therefore that Daniel by this speach onely sheweth, the great calamitie,
which should befall him, such as we vse to say a man wisheth to his enemie, <hi>Bulling.</hi> which
was the cause, he was so loath to open the dreame, because it pretended such heauie things:
but it is euident by Daniels troubled thoughts, that he was indeede sorie for the king, and
wished that euill farre away from him.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Dyonis. Carthusian.</hi> answereth, that this euill which he wished vnto the kings enemies,
might <hi>ad salutem animae proficere,</hi> be profitable vnto them for their soules health, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this wish was not vncharitable: But it might as well haue beene for the health of Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzars
soule, he should not then haue wished it from him.</p>
                        <p>3. Some thinke that it was rather <hi>ciuilis salutatio,</hi> then <hi>precatio ex fide,</hi> a ciuill kind of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation,
then a prayer of faith, which it was necessarie Daniel should vse, to insinuate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,

                        </p>
                        <p>4. But it was more then a ciuill salutation, for indeede Daniel desired <hi>averti tam horri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>5. But Daniel herein went not against the decree of God, for he thus prayeth, <hi>praesuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sito

burning the Temple, and putting the people to the sword, as also by his fierce rage shewed
against the Chaldeans, whom he vniustly caused to be killed, cap. 2. because they could not

2. Whereas, when there is no gouernement, but euery one doth what they list, there is
a confusion of all things, a corruption both of manners and religion, as appeareth in the
time of the Iudges, when as there was no king in Israel, they followed what religion they
would, Iudg. 17. 6. and they liued as they would themselues, without either feare of God
or man, as appeareth by the sinne of the men of Gibeah against the Leuites wife, Iudg. 19.</p>

in whom that want was supplied. And if a king loose one citie in his kingdome, yet
he may comfort himselfe in the rest: But Nebuchadnezzar at once should loose all his great
and large dominion, and be stripped of his regall dignitie: The Duke of Florence gaue for
his ensigne a great tree with many spreading boughes, one of them beeing cut off, with this
posie, <hi>vno avulso non deficit alter, one beeing pulled away the other faileth not:</hi> but here all the

                        </p>
                        <p>2. If it had beene told him, that he should onely loose his regall dignitie, and liue as a
common person, it had not beene so grieuous: but now when he heareth that he should be
throwne downe from such an high estate, into such an ignominious life, as to be matched

so prouiding, that as he had shewed himselfe in his tyrannicall and cruell gouernement

generall of the diuerse kinds of trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutations.</head>
                        <p>1. Their is one kind of transmutation, which is a fabulous and poeticall fiction, rather
then any true alteration and change, such as is the fable of the changing of <hi>Vlysses</hi> compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
into diuerse formes of beasts by the witchcraft of <hi>Circes,</hi> and of <hi>Diomedes</hi> companie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
birdes, and <hi>Lucianus</hi> tale of <hi>Apuleius</hi> golden asse: like vnto this is the fabulous report of
the Arcadians, which by swimming ouer a certaine riuer, are changed into wolues; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

thinke that it is false.</p>
                        <p>2. There is a kind of naturall and phisicall transmutation,<note place="margin">lib. 5. de. histor. animal. cap. 19.</note> as <hi>Aristotle</hi> sheweth how
certaine wormes become butter-flies: and by experience we knowe, that maggets, which
breed in flesh, are turned into flies. But <hi>Plinie</hi> reporteth a more strange thing of a certaine
beast in the Iappanian Islands, in bignesse, shape, and haire like vnto a dogge,<note place="margin">lib. 11. cap. 22.</note> which by oft
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:18834:69"/>
swimming in the Sea; by little and little is changed into a fish. But for the transmutation of
women into men, which <hi>Plinie</hi> of his owne experience reporteth to be true, and that
such things, as most true, are inserted into the Romane annales, or Chronicles,<note place="margin">lib. 7. cap. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>.</note> it is to be
doubted how farre his report may be credited.</p>
                        <p>3. The third kind is of phantasticall changes, such as are wrought by sorcetie and art
Magicke: such were those apparitions of serpents, procured by the subtiltie of the Egyptian
sorcerers: and such may be thought to be those alterations &amp; changes of men into the forme
of wolues and other beasts, which <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> writeth to be vsuall in <hi>Prussia, Liuonia, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuania.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>4. Vnto these adde, those true changes, which haue beene made by the power of God, as
Lots wife was turned into a pillar of salt, Moses rodde into a serpent, Christ turned water
into wine, <hi>Perer.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>5. And the last kind is the spirituall change which is in the minde and vnderstanding, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the better, as when men are renewed by grace, and from ignorance, infidelitie, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
lusts, are turned to become newe men, as <hi>Zacheus</hi> was, Luk. 19. or are inspired with
a propheticall gift, as Saul was, when he prophesied: either for the worse, as when the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God left Saul, and an euill spirit was sent vpon him, which possessed him with furie.
And of this kind was Nebuchadnezzars change, who of a reasonable man, became in his
minde an vnreasonable beast: But this matter followeth now to be handled more at large.</p>

thinke, that Nebuchadnezzar was indeede changed into an oxe. But <hi>Iosephus</hi> in that place,
where he toucheth that storie, <hi>lib. 10 antiquat. cap.</hi> 11. hath no such thing: he onely saith,
<hi>vitam acturus erat inter bestias,</hi> that he was to lead his life among the beasts. Indeede
<hi>Darotheus</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> are of opinion, that he was not changed at all in his minde,<note place="margin">Dorotheus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

onely externally in his bodie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that the forepart of him was like an oxe, the hinder part
like a lyon. But this cannot be so. 1. If they presse the words literally they may with better
reason say, he was changed into an eagle: because it is said, his haire was as eagles quilles,
and his nailes like birds clawes: 2. If there had beene in him any such notorius change it
would not haue beene omitted, seeing the power of God should haue beene set forth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.
3. And if the Chaldeans had seene him in the shape of a beast, they would haue taken
him for a very bruite beast, and not fit to be restored to his kingdome. 4. It is euident also
that the same Nebuchadnezzar a man, and not a beast, after the time expired, was restored
to his kingdome: but if he had beene so changed, he should not haue beene the same, but
an other.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Medina</hi> is of opinion, that Nebuchadnezzar was changed not indeede but in shewe,<note place="margin">lib. 2. de rect. in Deum side, cap. 7.</note>
that he appeared to be a bruit beast in the sight of all that looked vpon him: such a like
thing is that, which Hierome reporteth in the life of <hi>Hilarion,</hi> how a woman was brought
vnto him, which seemed vnto others to be a beast, but he discerned her to be a woman.</p>
                        <p>But Gods workes are not fantasticall, or in shewe: that which he doth is in veritie and
truth: this difference there is betweene Gods workes, and the illusions of Sathan, that he
maketh things to be the same which they appeare, as Moses rodde became a true serpent,
but Sathan deceiueth the sense, the sorcerers serpents were but counterfeit.</p>
                        <p>3. Neither yet can I altogether subscribe vnto the opinion of <hi>Thomas Aquin.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">lib. 1. de regim. princip. c. vlt.</note> who thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
that although <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> were neither actually, nor in shewe a beast in his bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shape, yet <hi>sua opinione videbatur sibi bestia,</hi> he seemed a beast vnto himselfe: I thinke ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with Calvin, <hi>non sic obstupuit, quin mala sua sentiret,</hi> he was not so besotted, but that he
had some sense of his calamitie: for otherwise how should he haue remembred it afterward,
and so giuen thankes to God for his restitution.</p>
                        <p>4. This then was the transmutation which Nebuchadnezzar had, <hi>manente forma huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
his mans shape remayning, his humane soule was changed to be brutish by his phrensie
and madnesse: <hi>Bulling.</hi> not that the minde of a beast was giuen him in substance, for he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned
his reasonable soule: nor yet that there was no more vnderstanding in him left, then
in a bruit beast, <hi>Osiand.</hi> for the reasonable soule remayning, though it became bruitish, yet
it is not altogether as the sense of a bruite beast: but as <hi>Lyranus</hi> saith, <hi>vsum rationis perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
per amentiam,</hi> he lost the vse of reason by his madnesse: his minde became bruitish, and in

sheweth, that he had not lost his shape, but his minde.</p>
                        <p>Yet he was somewhat altered and changed in the constitution, and sight of his bodie,
beeing growen mishapen and deformed, though not transformed into the shape of a beast,
as followeth to be shewed in the next question.</p>
                     </div>

                        <head>Quest. 30. How Nebuchadnezzars bodie
was changed.</head>
                        <p>1. As his minde was become sottish and bruitish, so the constitution of his bodie was
much changed and became applyable vnto that bruitish food, whereof he liued. 2. he went
naked hauing no care of his cloathing, as bruite beasts are onely couered with their skinne:
but here <hi>Lyranus</hi> noteth an error in Iosephus, who resembleth this nakednesse of Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,
to Adams nakednesse before the fall, whereof he giueth this reason, that <hi>Adam vix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
in simplicitate bestiali,</hi> Adam liued then in a brutish kind of simplicitie, as children before
they haue vse of reason are not ashamed of their nakednesse, &amp;c. But <hi>Lyranus</hi> argueth well
against this assertion: that by this reason mans state should haue beene bettered by his fall,
which brought vnto him the vse of reason. This matter then may be further thus scanned,
that there is an Angelicall kind of nakednesse (that I may so speake) such as Adam had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his fall, whereof he was not ashamed, because sinne was not yet entred into the world:
there is a <hi>brutish</hi> nakednesse, which because beasts haue no reason at all, neither are subiect to
sinne, is not vnseemely in them: there is an <hi>humane</hi> nakednesse between both, whereof men
are not ashamed, either because the vse of reason is not yet come vnto them, as in children,
or they are depriued of it altogether, as naturall fooles, or for a time onely, as madmen:
Such was the nakednesse of Nebuchadnezzar which altered the state of his bodie.</p>
                        <p>3. Then followeth the effect of his nakednesse, and his lying in the ayer, and in the cold
fields, enduring both heat, and cold: beeing carelesse of himselfe, his haire grewe stiffe, his
skinne hard, and his nayles long and crooked, and so he became deformed.</p>
                        <p>4. The gesture of his bodie was answerable, he grewe crooked, and bowed together,
and crept vpon all fower like a bruite beast.</p>
                        <p>5. His foode and meate was hearbes and grasse, such as the bruite beasts feed vpon. 6.
his habitation was in the fields and woods among the bruite beasts. 7. he had no vse of his
speach liuing among beasts, but made a rude noise like vnto them. And thus he was chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
euen in respect of his bodie, that although the fashion of his humane shape remained
still in his head, hands, and feete, yet he was become verie deformed: as <hi>Rupertus</hi> collecteth,
that seeing it is said he should eate grasse like an oxe, that he crept vpon his hands and his
feete, and pulled vp grasse with his mouth, as doth an oxe: and because his dwelling was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the beasts, he was in outward gesture as a beast, <hi>non enim besti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

beene no similitude: and so he concludeth that this was the greatest change that is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in Scripture, excepting onely that of Lots wife, who was changed into a pillar of
salt.</p>
                        <p>8. Now whereas ver. 33. as the vulgar Latine readeth, <hi>my figure returned vnto me,</hi> or

(not the change of his forme) which now was taken from him; as we see by experience,
that madde men if they continue any time, are so changed, that they can hardly be knowne
and discerned, <hi>Osian.</hi> yet this matter is made more cleare and out of doubt, if the word be

determined.</head>
                        <p>1. <hi>Pererius</hi> saith, that Daniel speaketh doubtfully, <hi>It may be God will forgiue thy sinne,</hi> as
the Latine readeth, <hi>non fuisse eum certum,</hi> that he was not certaine, whether God would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the punishment, which was thereatned: but Daniel knewe assuredly that the sentence
and decree of God should stand, as is shewed before, vers. 14.</p>

                           <pb n="133" facs="tcp:18834:70"/>
2. The most thinke that there was a secret condition annexed to this threatening, and
<hi>Hierome</hi> maketh it like to the message of Isaiah to Hezekiah, that he should die, and the
prophesie of Ionas against Niniue: which both were conditionall vpon their repentance, so
also <hi>Bullinger.</hi> But it may be gathered, v. 14. that it was certainely decreed in heauen, that
this iudgement should befal <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> who, the Lord foresaw, would not otherwise
be humbled.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> giueth this solution, <hi>propter hoc prolata est sententia, vt non fiat, non vt
Rex discat solum futura, sed vt caueat,</hi> therefore this sentence was pronounced, that it
should not come to passe, that the king should not onely know things to come, but preuent
them, &amp;c. ex <hi>Oecolamp.</hi> But this still is most euident, that God had certainely decreed this
thing, and it could not be altered.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Calvine</hi> thus answereth, this counsell of Daniel was profitable to the king, though the
iudgement were determined <hi>potuit aliquam veniam consequi etiamsi poenas dedisset,</hi> he might
some way haue beene eased, though he were to endure the punishment, &amp;c. so also <hi>Polan.
cum resipiscentibus Deus benignius agit,</hi> God dealeth more gently with those which repent.</p>
                        <p>5. To this may be added, that Daniel here sustaineth a double person, both of a Prophet
in interpreting the dreame, and shewing things to come, and of a faithfull counsellor, in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uising
Nebuchadnezzar what course to take: that although the sentence against him was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed,
yet if he did in time humble himselfe, he knew it would not be vnprofitable vnto him.
So our Blessed Sauiour, though he knewe that indeede the bitter cuppe of death could not
passe away from him, yet in his humane affection he desireth it to passe, yet with a subiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his will to the will of God: and the like supposition had Daniel here, thus aduising and
counselling, if so it stood with Gods good pleasure: not looking now into Gods secret coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,
but speaking in his loue and zeale to Nebuchadnezzar, as Moses in zeale to the people
of Israel forgetting himselfe, wished rather to be cut out of the booke of life, which in the
iudgement of faith he knewe could not be.</p>

                        <p>1. <hi>Pererius</hi> with other Romanists doe ground their error of satisfactorie workes for sinne
vpon this place: for their opinion is, that there are <hi>tria genera operum, quae satisfactoria vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
pro peccatis,</hi> three kind of workes, which they call satisfactorie for sinne: and so they
reade this text, <hi>redeeme thy sinnes. Contra.</hi> 1. The word is not well translated, <hi>to redeeme,</hi>
for <hi>Pharak,</hi> properly signifieth to breake off, as <hi>R. Shelemo,</hi> and <hi>D. Kimhi</hi> thinke, and so
is the word vsed, Exod. 33. 2. <hi>breake off your earings.</hi> 2. sinnes properly are not redeemed,
but men. 3. And it had beene impossible for Nebuchadnezzar, who had raigned tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
40. yeares to make satisfaction by his workes, for all the cruell murthers and other op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
which he had committed.</p>
                        <p>2. Some giue this sense retaining the vsuall reading, that good workes are said to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme
sinns, as they are said to iustifie, because they which are iustified, <hi>ex iustitia illa operum

so also <hi>Oecolamp. externa opera sidei testimoniu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dant,</hi> externall workes doe giue testimonie of
faith, which is not seene of men, but by their workes.</p>
                        <p>3. There is a third answer, that it is meant not of redemption or satisfaction of and for our
sinnes before God, but before men: <hi>redimimus apud homines p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

come, <hi>de sententia Dei dubitabat,</hi> did doubt of the sentence of God: and thereupon noteth
their presumption, which doe certainely promise remission of sinnes vnto any: But to say that
Daniel, who had such a cleare reuelation of Gods wil, doubted thereof, were to make que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
whether he had the spirit of God or no.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Carthusian</hi> thinketh that Daniel was certaine that God vpon his repentance would
forgiue him his sinne, but he was not sure whether he would remitte the punishment: but
the sinne beeing once remitted, the punishment also is pardoned, for it were not iust with
God to punish for that, which now is acquited: there may some chasticement remaine, not
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:18834:71"/>
as a punishment of sinne, but as an admonition and correction for amendement of life.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Pererius</hi> proceedeth further proouing from hence, <hi>nemini certam esse remissionem pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catorum,
&amp;c.</hi> that none can be certaine of remission of sinnes. But it is contrarie vnto faith
to be doubtfull or wauering, as our Sauiour saith vnto Peter, Matth. 14. 31. <hi>O thou of little

he was aduised by Daniel, and gaue plentifull almes, whereupon for his humilitie, <hi>mansit

eum non poenituit, neque Deum sententiae suae poenituit, &amp;c.</hi> because he repented not by
the admonitions of the Prophet, therefore neither did God repent him of his sentence: for
if he had humbled himselfe, it is not like that so soone he would haue so swelled in pride:
and his minde beeing set so vpon his magnificent buildings, it seemeth he little attended vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

of Babel.</head>
                        <p>Ver. 27. <hi>Which I haue built for the house of my kingdome, &amp;c.</hi> 1. There are diuerse o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
hereof, who should be the builder and founder of Babel. Moses saith that Babel
was the beginning of Nimroths kingdome,<note place="margin">lib. 9. de praepar. Euang. cap. vit.</note> Gen. 10. 10. <hi>Alexander Polyhistor</hi> in <hi>Eusebius,</hi>
out of <hi>Eupolemus,</hi> saith that it was built by the gyants after the flood. <hi>Alphaeus</hi> maketh Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus
the founder thereof, as <hi>Eusebius</hi> saith: the most of the Grecians, doe giue the honour
thereof vnto <hi>Semiramis</hi> the wife of <hi>Ninus,</hi> as <hi>Herodo. lib. 1. Diodo. lib. 3. Strabo. lib. 16.
Iustine</hi> with others.<note place="margin">lib. 10. cap. 11.</note> 
                           <hi>Iosephus</hi> out of <hi>Berosus</hi> maketh Nebuchadnezzar the builder of Babel,
and therfore findeth fault with the Greeke writers, for ascribing it vnto <hi>Semiramis.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. But all these may easily be reconciled. 1. Nimroth is held to be the same, who of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine
writters was called <hi>Belus:</hi> for this <hi>Belus</hi> was the first, that brought in idolatrie,<note place="margin">lib. 3. aduers. Iulian.</note> as <hi>Cyril</hi>
saith: and so was Nimroth: for hence it is, that most of the idols of the Gentiles tooke their
name from Bel, as the first founder of them, as Belial, or Baal, the God of the Sidonians,
Beelzebub the god of Ekron, Beelphegor the god of the Moabites, Numb. 25. Baalsamen
the idol of the Carthaginians, as Augustine saith: so then it may well stand togethet,<note place="margin">q. 16. in lib. Iudic.</note> that
Nimroth and Belus,<note place="margin">Hexap. in Gen. cap. 10. que. 14.</note> beeing both the same man, as is more at large shewed elsewhere, were
the founders of Babylon.</p>
                        <p>2. And seeing <hi>Ninus</hi> was the captaine and chiefe of the Gyants, they might be assistant
vnto him, in building of the tower of Babel, and he a tingleader vnto them.</p>
                        <p>3. It may also verie well agree, that Nimroth or Belus laid the first foundation of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,
which was enlarged by Semiramis.</p>
                        <p>4. And afterward when the Kings of Assyria left Babylon, &amp; made Niniue the cheife citie

was restored.</head>
                        <p>V. 31. <hi>At the ende of these dayes.</hi> 1. The author of the scholasticall historie, as <hi>Hugo
Cardi.</hi> here noteth, thinketh that at the prayer of Daniel, the 7. yeares were turned into sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
moneths, whereof 40. dayes Nebuchadnezzar was madde, and 40. other dayes he
came to himselfe and wept exceedingly for his sinne, so that his eyes were become as a peice
of flesh: then 40. dayes more he was in his madde fittes: and so after 7. moneths he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
to his right minde, but yet had not the kingdome, till 7. yeares were expired, but
there were 7. Iudges appointed for him, and he in the meane time, neither did eate flesh, nor
drinke wine all those seuen yeares, but did eate pulse, and hearbs, as Daniel counselled him,
and so did as it were penance.</p>
                        <p>2. But this opinion is contrarie to the text. 1. because the seauen times which were to
passe ouer him, were fulfilled, as appeareth, v. 31. <hi>at the ende of the dayes</hi> (that is the dayes
before appointed, which were called 7. times) <hi>then I Nebuchadnezzar lift vp mine eyes, &amp;c.</hi>
and not before, there was then no part of this time cut off. 2. After that his vnderstanding
came to him, he fell not againe into his madde fittes, as is euident, ver. 33. 3. when his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
was come to him, he was withall restored to the honour of his kingdome, and
his counsellers sought againe vnto him: he then tooke the gouernement presently vpon him,
after his returne and restitution, it was not gouerned by others. 4. This also is an euident
argument, that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> continued longer then seauen moneths in his humiliation,
because in so short a time his haire could not growe as eagles quilles, nor his nailes as birds
clawes: neither is it like that in so short a time he would haue beene brought to knowe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,

                        <p>As there were two degrees of his humiliation, he was depriued without of his kingdome,
and of the companie of men, and in himselfe of his vnderstanding; so there are two degrees
of his restitution: first, to his humane vnderstanding, and then to the glorie of his kingdome,
and each of these are set forth with their effects.</p>
                        <p>1. First, he is restored to his humane estate and condition, both in bodie, that whereas
before he went groueling, and crept on all fower as a beast, now he reareth vp his bodie, and
lifteth vp his eyes to heauen: then in his minde, <hi>mine vnderstanding was restored vnto me,</hi> but
that is here put last which was done first; for he was first restored to his vnderstanding, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he lift vp his eyes, <hi>Bulling.</hi> and as before he cast vp his eyes in pride, so nowe he lifteth
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:18834:73"/>
them vp in humilitie, <hi>Caluin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, the effect of this his restitution to his reason and vnderstanding, is the praysing
of God, with the reason thereof taken from the eternitie of the power and kingdome of
God, both which are amplified, 1. comparatiuely, <hi>All the inhabitants of the earth, are as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

before him:</hi> 2. by the effects, he doth what he will, and none can gainsay.</p>
                        <p>2. Then followeth the second part of his restitution, both to the societie of men, and to
the honour of his kingdome, v. 33. And the effect thereof, his praising and extolling of God,
with the argument of his praise, taken from three properties, and adjuncts of Gods workes,
the veritie and truth, iustice and equitie, and the power and omnipotence, in these words,
<hi>Whose workes are all truth, and his waies iudgement, and those that walke in pride he is able to
abase,</hi> v. 34.</p>

                        <p>v. 32. <hi>None can stay his hand, nor say vnto him, What doest thou?</hi> 1. They which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanely

law, may easily be answered, that this proposition, they <hi>whose wills onely stand for law are Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants,</hi>
is true onely among men, it concerneth not God: and the reason of this difference is,
God is a law to himselfe, <hi>quia voluntas eius est perfectissima iustitia,</hi> because his will is most
perfect iustice: <hi>Calvin.</hi> he can will nothing, but that which is holy and iust. So is it not with
man, whose will is corrupt and peruerse, and therefore it had neede of a rule and law to
guide it.</p>
                        <p>2. It is a question among the Ciuilians, whether the Prince haue not an absolute power

                        <p>3. But thus may these opinions be reconciled, that though Princes are both bound by

doe subiect themselues to their owne lawes for the example of others, and beyond all
these, they are tied by a straiter bond of Gods word; yet they are without checke of their
subiects: their doings are not of euery one to be called in question, as the Preacher saith, c. 8.
4. <hi>Where the word of the King is, there is power, and who shall say vnto him, what doest thou?</hi>
where Princes hold immediatly their kingdoms of God, there they are only to giue account
vnto God. But God is not to giue account vnto any: and therefore of him onely, simply, and
absolutely it is true, that none can say, <hi>What doest thou?</hi> both because of his perfect iustice,
that none can finde fault with his workes, and his absolute power, that he is not subiect to
the checke of any.</p>

                        <p>1. It may be obiected that he was not, out of that place Isa. 14. 14. <hi>Thou shalt be brought
downe to hell, to the sides of the pit:</hi> which beeing spoken of <hi>Nebuchadnezzer</hi> sheweth his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting
destruction in hell: and the rather, because in him is set forth and described the
fall of Lucifer, who with the rest of the reprobate angels were cast downe to hell.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Though it be admitted and graunted, that <hi>Nebuchadnezzer</hi> herein were a
type of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> yet it is not necessarie, that all things which are expressed in such typicall
predictions, should agree vnto the type: for some things are so spoken, that they may fitly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
both vnto the type and figure, and to the thing prefigured, some vnto the signe onely,
some vnto the thing prefigured onely: as in the 2. Psalme, where Dauid is a type of Christ:
the 2. verse, <hi>The kings of the earth band themselues, &amp;c.</hi> agreeth vnto both: and v. 6. <hi>I haue set
my king vpon Zion:</hi> but these words, v. 7. <hi>Thou art my Sonne, this day haue I begotten thee,</hi>
can onely be applied vnto Christ: So in this place, this casting downe to hell may be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
onely of Lucifer here prefigured: <hi>Perer.</hi> but there are better answers then this.</p>
                        <p>2. As this commination against the King of Babylon is conditionally vnderstood: that
vnlesse he repen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           <pb n="139" facs="tcp:18834:73"/>
3. As it may be an allegoricall speech shewing his great abasement, as that other is, <hi>I will
ascend aboue the height of the cloudes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. But yet it may be further and better answered, that it is not necessarie to vnderstand
this prophecie of Nebuchadnezzer, but rather it was performed in <hi>Balthazar:</hi> for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
prophesieth also together of the destruction of Babylon, which continued many yeares
after the death of <hi>Nebuchadnezzer.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>5. And lastly, the word translated hell, signifieth also the graue, and so better interpreted
here, because there is mention made of the pit.</p>
                        <p>2. Wherefore the more probable and certen opinion is, that Nebuchadnezzer in the end
was saued: as may appeare by these reasons.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi>Iosephus</hi> saith, that Nebuchadnezzer all his life long after this did acknowledge God,
and gaue praise and glorie vnto him. 2. Dorotheus in <hi>Synops.</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> inferre as
much vpon his afflictions, that God therefore chastened him, because he would not haue him
perish. 3.<note place="margin">lib. de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                           <hi>Augustine</hi> sheweth as much by the diuers end of Pharaoh and Nabuchadnezzer,
that he was hardened in his sinne, and so giuen ouer to destruction, the other was humbled
vnder Gods hand, and so saued. 4. Theodoret likewise moouing the question, why the
Lord punished Nabuchadnezzers for a time, but Balthazar with sudden death, maketh this
answer; because the Lord did foresee, that the one would be amended by his corrections,
but the other was irrecorrigible. 5. Lastly, <hi>Lyranus</hi> addeth this reason, <hi>scripturae terminat
historiam in eius humiliatione, &amp;c. &amp; fidei confessione,</hi> the Scripture endeth this storie in his
humiliation, and confession of faith: which it vseth not to doe in them, that afterward fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,

                        <p>1. <hi>Augustine</hi> putting forth this question,<note place="margin">de gratia. c. 15.</note> sheweth wherein both of these were like:
<hi>quantum ad naturam, ambo homines, &amp;c.</hi> in respect of their nature, they were both men: for
their dignitie, they were both kings: their cause was the fame, they both held the people of
God captiue: <hi>quantum ad poenam,</hi> and for their punishment, they both were gently admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with Gods scourges: and yet their ends were diuers: the question is, <hi>cur medicamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
vnius medici manu confectum, alij ad interitum, alij valuerit ad salutem, &amp;c.</hi> why a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
made by the hand of the same physitian, should be effectuall to the destruction of the
one, and for the health of the other.</p>
                        <p>2. His answer is this, because the one was humbled vnder the Lords correction, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hardened: but then it will be asked, why the one was humbled, the other hardened: the
answer must be this, <hi>illi vt mutaretur adfuisse diuinum, huic vt iudicaretur, defuisse praesidium,</hi>
that the one had Gods helpe to change him, the other wanted it, and so was hardened. But
if any thinke further that this is vniust, that God should assist one, and not an other, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
answereth, <hi>The Lord hath mercie on whome he will, and whome he will he harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,</hi>
Rom. 9. And so he concludeth, <hi>omnia illa adiuvante Domino perfici, vel deserente per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitti,
nolente vero Domino nihil prorsus admitti, &amp;c.</hi> that all these things are perfited and
brought to passe, God so helping, or permitted God so forsaking them, but nothing is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

out of prison.</head>
                        <p>1. Though <hi>Nabuchadnezzer</hi> beeing thus brought to acknowledge God, did incline al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to sauour his people, which in all likelihood was the more encreased by Daniels meanes,

Nabuchadnezzer liued not long after this, and so could not perfit his fauour toward

intended before his death to set him at libertie, and therefore his sonne did it, to
fulfill his fathers minde, as soone as he came to the kingdome: or els it pleased God by this

set downe, which are these two, to depart from sinne, and to follow righteousnes: as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
Isai saith, <hi>Cease to doe euill, learne to doe well,</hi> Isa. 1. 16.</p>
                        <p>2. Hence also the effects of true repentance are gathered, which are the fruits of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes:
so that in vaine doth one afflict himselfe, if he doe not alter and change his life: such
are reprooued by the Prophet, Isa. 58. 5. that did afflict their soules for a day, and bow downe
their head like a bulrush, and yet continued in their sinne.</p>
                        <p>3. The qualitie of true repentance is here also expressed, that it may not be deferred or
put off, but speedily prosequuted: which is signified by this phrase of breaking off. As the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
to the Hebr. c. 3. 7. vrgeth that place, <hi>to day if you will heare his voice, harden not your
hearts.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. The benefit of true repentance followeth, it procureth peace, and tranquilitie, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenteth
the iudgements of God: as here Nabuchadnezzer is promised, that by this meanes,
his peace might be prolonged: So our blessed Sauiour saith, Luk. 13. 3. <hi>Except ye repent, ye

                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. It is before sufficiently declared, Quest. 30. that the true reading here is not,
<hi>redeeme,</hi> but, <hi>breake off thy sinnes.</hi> 2. Though that other reading be retained, the meaning
onely is, that he should redeeme, and satisfie men whome he had wronged. 3. And this
had beene impossible for him to doe, to make recompence to so many, whome he had cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
handled the space of 40. yeares. 4. And if he would not make satisfaction vnto men,
much lesse vnto God. 5. Wherefore in these words, <hi>non exponitur modus redimendi pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,
sed modus potius agendi,</hi> the way of redeeming his sinne is not declared, but the way ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

as <hi>Nabuchadnezzer</hi> could not satisfie for his sinne, no more can any man: for our best works
are imperfect: our righteousnes is as a stained clout, Isa. 6. 6. but that which must satisfie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, ought to be perfect, and absolute: it is therefore the most perfect righteousnes of

of mercie which we shew, which is called an <hi>actiue</hi> mercie, but of mercie shewed vnto vs

her great loue was not the cause, but the signe rather and effect of the forgiuenes of her

there is not in God, to suffer any thing, which he would not haue done. He suffereth sinne

Daniel.</p>
                     <p>In the vision these things are declared. 1. the occasion wherefore this vision
was sent, which was the profanation of the vessels of the Temple, which is set forth in this
manner. 1. the occasion, the king made a feast, v. 1. 2. the vessels are brought and abused
in excessiue drinking at the kings commandement, v. 2. 3. 3. &amp; withall they blaspheme God,
and praise their idols, v. 4.</p>

                     <p>3. The effects are two. 1. the king seeth it, v. 5. 2. vpon his fight he is troubled, both
inwardly in his thoughts, and outwardly in his bodie, his countenance is changed, his Ioynes
loosed, and his knees smote together, v. 6.</p>
                     <p>In the interpretation, there is the way and preparation made vnto it, vnto v. 17. then the

declaration it selfe, from v. 17. to the ende.</p>
                     <p>In the preparation there is, 1. the kings inquisition of his soothsayers, but all in vaine,
v. 10. 2. his sending for Daniel at the Queenes motion. In the inquisition. 1. the wise
men are called. 2. the matter is propounded with promise of great reward, v. 7. 3. their
vaine attempt is shewed, v. 8. 4. the euent thereof the kings perplexitie, v. 9.</p>

and his princes, his wiues and concubines might drinke therein.</p>
                     <p>3. Then were brought the golden vessels, which they had taken out of the Temple of the

                        <head>Quest. 1. Why this chapter is transposed and not set downe
according to the order of time.</head>
                        <p>1. It is euident by the last verse of this chapter, that this historie fell out in the last yeare
of Balthazars raigne, for at this time Babylon was taken: but the prophesies and visions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
cap. 7. 8. were shewed vnto Daniel before, the one in the first yeare, c. 7. 8. the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the third, cap. 8. 1.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="148" facs="tcp:18834:78"/>
2. The reason hereof is this, because Daniel would set downe together all the matters of
fact and historie vnto the 7. chapter, and then followe the propheticall visions together,
which onely were reuealed to Daniel, from cap. 7. to the ende; beside this chapter hath a very
fit coherence with the former: for as there it is shewed how Nebuchahnezzar was punished
for his pride, so the like is set forth here in the fall of <hi>Balthazar.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. It is like that many other memorable acts fell out in the raigne of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi>
his sonne <hi>Euilmerodach,</hi> and this <hi>Balthazar,</hi> but Daniel onely toucheth such things, <hi>quorum
vtilis futura erat posteris memoria,</hi> the memorie and knowledge whereof might be profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

But beside, that to sit according to their age, is not to drinke according to their age, and it
is not like that there was any order or measure obserued in drinking, in this riotus feast, there

                        <p>1. It will be obiected, that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> did as much profane them, by placing them
in the Temple of his idols, as the Philistims in bringing the Arke into the house of Dagon:
but there the Lord shewed his iudgement euen vpon their god in striking off his head and
hands, and punished also the Philistims for that profanation, 1. Sam. 5.</p>
                        <p>2. The answer here is, that the contempt was not alike: for the Philistims presented their
idol with the Arke as a monument of their victorie, and so robbed God of his honour, but
Nebuchadnezzar of some religious respect did lay vp these vessels in the Temple, as not fit
to be profaned and turned to any common vse: and therefore so long as the vessels were
there kept, the Lord seemed not to be angrie, <hi>Hugo ex gloss.</hi> This also may be added, that
the Arke was a more sacred thing, then the golden vessels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for that was not lawful to be tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched

in the beginning of their feasts, as <hi>Athen. lib. 8. Dypnosophist. c.</hi> 13. 2. These
were made of diuers mettalls, according to the propertie of those things which they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented:
as they made the image of the Sunne of gold, of Mars of yron, of the Moone of sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer:
as <hi>Alexander</hi> the coppersmith is said to haue made siluer shrines for Diana, Act. 19.
<hi>Lyran.</hi> 3. And further how absurd and foolish the Chaldean idolatrie was, is thus descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
Baruch, c. 6. v. 3. You shall see in Babel gods of gold and siluer borne vpon mens shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders:
v. 9. they make crownes of gold for their heads. v. 13. one holdeth a scepter, as though
he were a certaine Iudge of the countrey, yet can not slay such as offend him. v. 14. an other
hath an axe or dagger, or an axe in his right hand, yet is not able to defend himselfe in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell.
v. 16. their eyes are full of dust. v. 17. the Priests keepe the Temples shut with doores
and barres vpon them, as gates are shut vp round about vpon offenders. v. 18. they light vp
candles before them, &amp;c. such is the vanitie of their idols, and the blindnes of those which
worship them.</p>
                        <p>2. And what their obscenitie was in their idolatrous seruice, is shewed in the same place,
v. 42. the women girded with coards, sit in the streets, and burne straw: and if one of them
be drawne away, and lie with any such as come by, shee casteth her neighbour in the teeth,
because shee was not so worthily reputed, nor her coard broken.<note place="margin">Her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           <hi>Herodotus</hi> sheweth at large
the manner of this vile custome among the Babylonians, how euery woman once in her life
is bound to goe to the temple of Venus, and there to sit, vntill one come and cast money into
her lappe, which she taking must rise and goe aside with him, and suffer him to haue his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of her. They which are beautifull are soone dispatched of their attendance, but they
which are deformed are faine to sit two or three yeares, till some stranger come vnto them.
Thus their idolatrie was ioyned with obscenitie: as at this time, while they praise their gods
of siluer and gold, they haue their concubines present. And therefore Balthazars fault was
the greater, <hi>quia vasa illa exposuit vxoribus &amp; concubinis,</hi> because he did expose those vessels

                        <head>Quest. 12. How farre it is lawfull to apply sacred things
to profane vses.</head>
                        <p>1. <hi>Polanus</hi> is of opinion, that it is not lawfull at all to transferre things consecrated vnto
God to any prophane vse: for if Balthazzar were reprooued for profaning the holy vessels,
much greater is the fault of Christians to abuse such things: &amp; so he concludeth, <hi>papistis erep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,
&amp;c.</hi> things taken from the Papists, if they be consecrated vnto God, <hi>eidem dicata mane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant,</hi>
they must so remaine still.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. There is great difference to be made betweene things rightly consecrated vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, and true religion, and things applyed to superstitious vses, as <hi>Melancthon</hi> wel saith,
<hi>res consecratas sine verbo Dei, non esse discernendas à prophanis,</hi> that things consecrate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any warrant of Gods word, are not discerned from prophane, &amp;c. there is not then the
like reason betweene the vessels of the Temple, which were consecrated to Gods seruice by
his owne commandement, which were no wayes to be profaned, and such things as are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
to Popish superstition, which haue no such warrant. 2. It is euident that Hezekiah,
when he brake downe the hrasen serpent, which was abused to idolatrie, did apply it to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
vses, calling it but a peice of brasse, 2. King. 18. 4.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Lyranus</hi> opinion is, that the consecrated things, the propertie and forme not altered,
should not be translated vnto any other vse: and therefore saith he, it was decreed, <hi>vt calix
in propria forma, non vendatur nisi alteri Ecclesiae, &amp;c.</hi> that a chalice in the proper forme,
should not be sold, but vnto an other Church. <hi>Contra.</hi> But there may be such necessitie of

of <hi>Iustinian,</hi> that to redeeme captiues it should be lawfull to sell the vessells and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
of the Church, and this reason is yeelded, <hi>non absurdum est animas hominum qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buscunque

                        <p>3. It is not then simply vnlawfull to translate vpon some vrgent occasion things conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate
to religion to some other vses: wherein these seuerall considerations must be obserued.</p>
                        <p>We must distinguish betweene things deuoted vnto God and his seruice, and things or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
to superstitious vses, which haue no right consecration.</p>
                        <p>1. Concerning superstitious implements they may be conuerted to other vses. 1. so
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:18834:80"/>
that it be done <hi>sine furto,</hi> without theft, or any disorderly manner: not by any priuate man,
but by such as haue authoritie. 2. It must be prouided, that sufficient maintenance be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
vnto the Church, such superstitious dedications beeing cut off: <hi>quantum opus est
Ecclesus, impertire debent,</hi> they must impart vnto the Church so much as is sufficient. 3. The
things superstitiously abused, and euill imployed, as to maintaine idle bellies, and Abbey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lubbers,
should be conuerted vnto good vses, the maintenance of preachers, releefe of the
poore and such like. 4. The things taken from Ecclesiasticall vse, must not be abused to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot
and excesse: which made Balthazars fault the greater, in prophaning these holy vessels in
his drunken feast. And so it hath beene the miserable vse in some places, that great men, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptis
bonis in conuiuijs, frequenter se conuertunt ad spoliandum ecclesias, &amp;c.</hi> hauing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
their owne goods in banketting and feasting, doe often fall to the spoyling of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
<hi>gloss. ordinar.</hi> 5. A difference is to be made in those things which are consecrated:
some are of necessarie vse, and are not to be alienated: some were added of superfluitie, and
were not so pertinent, or properly belonging to the Church: as the politike dominions, and
ciuill iurisdictions, which were giuen to Ecclesiasticall persons, were not so fit to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
by them: <hi>Melancth.</hi> But the tithes of the Church, as the proper maintenance thereof,
and originally theirs, it had beene happie, if they neuer had beene alienated.</p>
                        <p>2. Now as touching things consecrated vnto true religious vses, there is lesse libertie in
alienating of such things: where these cauteles must be obserued. 1. We must distinguish
betweene those things, which are of necessarie vse in Gods seruice, and those which are not
so necessarie: as the high Priest gaue Dauid Goliaths sword, which was consecrated vnto
God, but of no vse in his seruice: the holy vessels, which were vsed in the Temple, he would
not so easily haue giuen him. 2. Euen those Church implements<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which are vsed, must giue
place to necessitie, and to workes of charitie, as is shewed before: for God will haue mercie,
and not sacrifice: to adorne Churches with gold, and to suffer the poore members of Christ
to starue, is not pleasing vnto him. Dauid in his extreame hunger did eate of the shew bread,
which it was not lawfull for any but the Priests to eate. 3. But like as Dauid, if he could
haue prouided other bread, would not haue eaten of that: so all meanes must first be vsed,
and the last refuge must be to the Church goods, in such extreame cases, and vrgent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities.</p>

downe simply, that the fingers of a mans hand appeared: there is no note of similitude ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
2. Though it is said expressely, that <hi>Balthazar</hi> saw it, it followeth not, but that others
might see it also. 3. Neither is his reason good, though the rest had not seene it: for God
may open the eyes of some to see such visions, which others see not: as the young man with
the Prophet, saw not at the first the fierie charets and horse which the Prophet saw, till his

                        <p>1. <hi>Lyranus</hi> thinketh the Chaldees could not read the writing, because it was written in
Hebrew letters, which they were ignorant of: but there beeing such great affinitie betweene
the Hebrew and Chalde tongue, it is not like there was such difference in the characters, but
that the learned among them might haue read them.</p>
                        <p>2. The Hebrew Cabbalists imagine, that the letters were inuerted, and the words tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed,
and set out of order, and so they could not read them: but it seemeth by Daniels rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the writing, and setting downe of the words in order, as they were written, that there
was no such transposing.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Pererius</hi> thinketh the meaning is, that they could not read the words with any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
they knew not what words to ioyne together, to make any sense or constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of them: but it is euident by Daniels speech afterward, that they could neither read the
writing at all, nor giue the interpretation: for first he saith, <hi>This is the writing:</hi> it should
seeme then, that they could not so much as spell the words: and then he addeth, <hi>This is the
interpretation,</hi> v. 26.</p>
                        <p>4. Wherefore it is most probable, that this writing was written in some strange and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
characters vnto the Chaldeans: or rather which is most like, that they were so blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and astonished by the power of God, that they could not read it: they were <hi>caecitate &amp;
stupore perculsi,</hi> smitten with blindnes and stupiditie. <hi>Polan.</hi> so also <hi>Calvin.</hi>

raigned but 3. yeares, beeing the eldest sonne, and heire to the kingdome. 2. the other
reason <hi>Lyranus</hi> vrgeth, which <hi>Pintus</hi> also approoueth, because shee speaketh of things done

                        <head>21. Quest. In what sense Nabuchadnezzer is called
Balthazars father.</head>
                        <p>1. Some thinke that Nabuchadnezzer was his great grandfather, and that Balthazar was
not the third, but the fourth from him: so <hi>Iosephus</hi> whome <hi>Hierome</hi> and <hi>Beda</hi> follow: see
before, qu. 2. But this can not be so, because Ierem. 27. v. 5, 6. the Lord promiseth the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to Nabuchadnezzer, and to his sonne, and to his sonnes sonne, and staieth there.</p>
                        <p>2. An other opinion was of <hi>Alexander Polyhistor,</hi> and <hi>Alpheus,</hi> with others, whome
<hi>Iosephus</hi> mentioneth, <hi>lib. 1. cont. Appion.</hi> that foure raigned after Nabuchadnezzer: 1. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilmerodach.
2. Niglasar</hi> his sisters husband, who killed him. 3. <hi>Labosardach</hi> his sonne,
who was deposed for his misgouernment, and slaine: and then <hi>Balthazar</hi> was chosen by
common consent. But by this account Balthazar should not be at all of Nabuchadnezzers
stocke and line, contrarie to the Scripture, which calleth him his sonne.</p>
                        <p>3. The author of the Scholasticall historie saith, that there were two Nabuchadnezzers,
the father and the sonne: and that Euilmerodach was brother to the second, and raigned af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him, who had three sonnes which succeeded one an other in the kingdome after him,
<hi>Niglazar, Labosardach,</hi> and <hi>Balthazar:</hi> so he maketh Nabuchadnezzer the great, grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of this Balthazar, and Balthazar to raigne in the fift place. But it is euident in storie,
that Euilmerodach succeeded next to Nabuchadnezzer his father, not to his brother of that
name: for Nabuchadnezzer is held to haue raigned 43. yeares at the least, as <hi>Iosephus:</hi> but he
raigned rather 45. in the 8. yeare of his raigne Iechonias was carried captiue, in the 37. yeare
of whose captiuitie, which was the 45. yeare of Nabuchadnezzer, <hi>Euilmerodach</hi> began to
raigne, 2. king. 25. 27.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Pererius</hi> misliketh this opinion, because he maketh two Nabuchadnezzers, whereas <hi>sacrd
&amp; profana historia vnum tantum agnoscit,</hi> both the sacred and prophane histories (saith he)
acknowledgeth but one Nabuchadnezzer king of Chaldea, &amp;c. wherein I wonder at his
forgetfulnes, beeing otherwise a most diligent writer, seeing <hi>Iosephus</hi> euidently maketh two
Nabuchadnezzers, the father, to whome he ascribeth 21. yeares, and his sonne, to whome he
giueth 43. yeares <hi>lib. 10. antiq. c.</hi> 11.</p>
                        <p>4. The fourth opinion is of <hi>Theodoret</hi> in this chapter, and <hi>Severus Sulpitius lib. 2. sacr.
histor.</hi> that Nabuchadnezzer had two sonnes, Euilmerodach the elder, and Balthazar the
younger, who raigned successiuely one after an other: and so they thinke, that Balthazar was
in deede the sonne of Nabuchadnezzer: But this can not be so: for seeing this Balthazar was
the last of the Chaldean kings, and Ieremie prophesied that the kingdome should be giuen
to Nabuchadnezzer, and to his sonne, and to his sonnes sonne, now this prophesie should
not be fulfilled, if the kingdome did onely remaine to him, and to his sonnes.</p>
                        <p>5. Not farre differing from this opinion, is that which is found in the booke of Baruch, c.
1. 11. <hi>Pray for Nabuchadnezzar, and for the life of Balthazar his sonne:</hi> where the author of
that booke, seemeth to make Balthazar the eldest sonne of Nabuchadnezzer, as next heire to
the kingdome. <hi>Pererius</hi> would thus helpe the matter, that either Nabuchadnezzer had an
other sonne called Balthazar, who should haue beene king if he had liued, or that Euilme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodach
was also so called: thus also <hi>Emmanuel Sa.</hi> But neither of these assertions can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
out of the Canonicall Scriptures, which euidently testifie, that <hi>Euilmerodach</hi> was the
sonne of Nabuchadnezzer, and not Balthazar, 2. king. 25. 27. and Ierem. 52. 31.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi>Pintus</hi> hath an other conceit, that <hi>Euilmerodach</hi> might be called <hi>Nabuchadnezzer,</hi>
                           <pb n="156" facs="tcp:18834:82"/>
which was a generall name to all the Chaldean kings, as the Emperours were called <hi>Caesars,</hi>
of the first Emperour: and thus he saith Balthazar was Nabuchadnezzers, that is, Euilmero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dachs
sonne: but no where in Scripture doth it appeare, that Nabuchadnezzer was a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
name to the kings of Chaldea, neither that Euilmerodach or Balthazar are so called.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Pererius</hi> opinion is, that Balthazar was the nephew, not properly the sonne of Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzer,
yet he raigned not in the third place, but in the fift: there came betweene two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
named by forren writers, <hi>Niglasar,</hi> and <hi>Labosardach,</hi> the first was Euilmerodachs sisters
husband, who slue Euilmerodach, and so raigned, and <hi>Labosardach</hi> his sonne after him, who
was deposed and slaine for his crueltie: and then <hi>Balthazar,</hi> who fled vnto the Medes, was
restored vnto the kingdome: so <hi>Ioseph. lib. 1. cont. Appion.</hi> Now <hi>Pererius</hi> reason is this, why
some other raigned betweene, because otherwise the tearme of 70. yeares captiuitie can not
be made vp: for the captiuitie began in the 19. yeare of Nabuchadnezzer, when Ierusalem
was taken, there remained 25. yeares of his raigne, who raigned in all 43. Euilmerodach 18.
yeares, and Balthazar 17. all these yeares make but 60. there wanted yet 10. yeares, which
must be made vp by the raigne of others comming betweene.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. Though <hi>Pererius</hi> opinion be admitted as probable, that some vsurpers came
betweene <hi>Euilmerodach,</hi> and <hi>Balthazar,</hi> yet the reason which he vrgeth, is not sufficient: for
the 70. yeares captiuitie doe take beginning rather from the 8. yeare of Nabuchadnezzer,
when Iechonias went into captiuitie, 2. king. 24. 12. for from that time the Prophets doe
begin the account of the 70. yeares, Ezek. 1. 1. and c. 24. 1. and in other places of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie.
And <hi>Nabuchadnezzer</hi> raigned 45. yeares: 8. yeares before the captiuitie began, 2.
king. 24. 12. and 37. yeares of the captiuitie: 2. king. 25. 27. so that the ten yeares which are
wanting, may thus be filled vp.</p>
                        <p>8. <hi>Pererius</hi> thinketh, that the strange names of <hi>Niglazar,</hi> and <hi>Labosardach,</hi> mentioned
by <hi>Iosephus,</hi> were the same with <hi>Euilmerodach</hi> and <hi>Balthazar,</hi> called by other names, <hi>in 2.
cap. Daniel.</hi> But <hi>Iosephus,</hi> and other writers whome he followeth, as <hi>Berosus, Alexander
Polyhistor,</hi> with others, make these diuers kings from the rest: for <hi>Iosephus</hi> nameth <hi>Abiloma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodach</hi>
beside, who in Scripture is called <hi>Euilmerodach.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>9. The truth then is this, that <hi>Euilmerodach,</hi> as <hi>Pererius</hi> reporteth out of some writers,
was slaine by <hi>Niglazar,</hi> or <hi>Neegal-etzer</hi> his sisters husband; or as <hi>Iunius</hi> out of others, he
was expulsed out of his kingdome, and he with Balthazar his sonne liued in exile among the
Medes: in the meane time <hi>Niglasar,</hi> and his sonne <hi>Labosardach</hi> after him, a while vsurped
the kingdome, and after that Balthazar was restored: So that <hi>Balthazar</hi> was in deede the
right nephew of <hi>Nabuchadnezzer,</hi> yet called his sonne according to the phrase of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:

                        <p>It consisteth of 4. parts: 1. the salutation: <hi>O King, liue for euer,</hi> whereby shee doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuate
her selfe, 2. the proposition, which containeth the drift and scope of her speech,
that he should not be troubled, v. 10.</p>
                        <p>3. The narration followeth containing a reason, why he should not be troubled, because
there was a man found in his kingdome, who was able to reueale this secret. In this narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
three things are expressed, 1. a description of Daniel by his gifts, 2. the experience of
his gifts in the daies of <hi>Nabuchadnezer,</hi> which were three: light or illumination by Gods
spirit, vnderstanding in the apprehension of those things which were reuealed, and wisdome
in wisely and fitly applying the same. 3. then the approbation of his gifts, and publike te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
by his aduancement: he was set ouer all the wise men.</p>
                        <p>4. The fourth part is the conclusion, that Daniel might be sent for to interpret the kings
vision: with a repetition of the argument taken from his sufficiencie and abilitie, which
consisted either in his gifts, which are the three before named, an excellent spirit called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(light,) vnderstanding, and knowledge called before (wisdome:) or els in the exercising

found to be the onely admirer of Daniels gifts, <hi>Oecolamp,</hi> and setteth him forth as one
excelling all other in the gifts of wisedome and vnderstanding. 4. And beside in making
mention of Nebuchadnezzar, a prince of great wisedome and iudgement, who aduanced
Daniel for his excellent wisdom, <hi>ostendit eum nimis crasse arrare,</hi> she sheweth that he greatly
erred in neglecting such an excellent man in his kingdom, and seeking satisfaction of others,
where it was not to be found, <hi>Calvin,</hi> herein then appeareth her faithfulnesse in giuing such
good aduice vnto the king. 5. And the Queene whom <hi>Herodotus</hi> calleth <hi>Nitocris,</hi> is by the
same author commended for a woman of great wisedom, whereof he giueth this experiment:
she caused her tombe to be made in an high and conspicuous place ouer one of the gates of
the citie, with an inscription to this effect, that if any of the kings of Babylon wanted mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
if he opened that sepulchre, he should finde enough: Afterward <hi>Darius</hi> of Persia o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened

Nebuchadnezzar, and refuseth them from
Balthazar.</head>
                        <p>1. The reason of this difference is, because Daniel knewe that Nebuchadnezzar was esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
in the kingdome, which the Lord had giue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> to him, and to his sonne: and therefore
he made no refusall of the honours which were offred vnto him, because thereby he might
stand the Church of God in great stead: But the case was now otherwise: for he knewe that
Balthazars kingdome was at an ende, and these honours vnder him he could not long hold:
and the Monarchie of the Chaldeans beeing at an ende, he could not thereby aduantage the
people of God, <hi>Polan.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. Because also their was greater obstinacie and stubbornenesse in Balthazar, then there
was in <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, ideo oftendit se minus ei deferre, quam avo,</hi> and therefore he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,

                        <p>This shewed no inconstancie at all in Daniel to suffer that to be done vnto him, which
before he in words refused. 1. It is like, that they were verie vrgent and instant vpon
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:18834:83"/>
him to accept of the kings offers. 2. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> giueth this reason, that if he had beene
stiffe in refusing still, it would haue beene thought, <hi>quod ipse de responso suo addubit asset,</hi> that
he himselfe had doubted of the truth of his answer: and therefore to take away that suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he vpon that instance accepteth of the rewards: so also <hi>Occolampad. Bulling.</hi> 3. An o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reason was, <hi>qui mundi diuitias contempserat, ne regem ipsum contemnere videretur,</hi> least
he which had despised the riches of the world, should haue seemed to haue set the king him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
at naught, he accepteth of the kings offers, <hi>Pintus.</hi> 4. If he had still obstinately refused,
he might haue beene brought <hi>in suspicionem proditionis,</hi> into suspicion of treason, <hi>Calvin.</hi>
as though he had conspired with the Medes and Persians against the king, if he had refused
Balthazars rewards and offers. 5. <hi>signum fuisset timiditatis,</hi> it had beene also a signe of feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse,
that by this meanes he might haue lien hid still, and so escaped the danger, beeing
called to no publike place: he therefore in accepting of these honours, <hi>ostendit se imperter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritum,</hi>
sheweth himselfe without feare, <hi>Caluin.</hi>

                        <p>1. Neither is this a description of Nebuchadnezzars tyrannie and cruell gouernement, as
though he put to death the innocent, and spoyled men of their goods, without iust cause or
equitie: for that this is not meant of the abuse of his power, the next v. following sheweth,
<hi>But when his heart was puft vp:</hi> this power then might be in <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and his heart
not yet lifted vp.</p>
                        <p>2. Neither yet doe I thinke with <hi>Bullinger,</hi> that it is like, that Nebuchadnezzar, <hi>non in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuste
suum administrauit regnum,</hi> did not vniustly administer his kingdome: for the contrarie
appeareth, c. 2. in that he commanded the Chaldeans to be slaine without cause, for that
they could not tell the king his dreame, which he had forgotten: and c. 3. he commaunded
the three seruants of God to be cast into the fierie fornace, for refusing to worship the idol
which he had set vp.</p>
                        <p>3. Nor yet can it be prooued by this place, that princes haue authoritie, to take away
their subiects liues and goods at their pleasure: for euen kings themselues must remember,

touching the abuse or right vse thereof: But sheweth to what eminent authoritie God had
exalted him, that he might exalt and cast downe whom he list: to shewe that God had giuen
him this great honour and power, for the which he was feared of all. This amplitude and
greatnesse of his authoritie is set forth by two effects. 1. the one is in his subiects, they fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and stood in awe of him, both for the inward conscience which they had of authoritie,
and in respect of his great and absolute power: the other is in the king himselfe, he might
doe and did what he would, both the liues and goods of men were at his becke, <hi>Polan.</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel

                        <p>1. By this example of Daniel, who scanneth the words themselues, and thereupon
groundeth his interpretation, the Rabbines would warrant their deuise of their <hi>Cabbalisticall</hi>
interpretation, whereby they take vpon them by hunting after syllables and letters to finde
out mysteries in Scripture: thinking that they may take vnto themselues the like libertie,
which Daniel here vsed.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. They must first be sure, that they haue the like propheticall spirit, which
Daniel had, before they may aduenture vpon such mysticall interpretations. 2. the occasion
is not alike: this writing was extraordinarie, and therefore it was obscure and mysticall: but
the writing of the Scripture containeth an ordinarie and plaine forme of doctrine, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is not in such curious manner to be handled. 3. neither did Daniel here examine eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
letter and syllable, as the <hi>Cabalists</hi> do, but taketh the words onely as they lie in order, and
maketh vp a full sense of them.</p>

                        <head>Quest. 33. Why the first word Mene
is doubled.</head>
                        <p>1. Some do giue this reason of this repetition, the word <hi>mene,</hi> is deriued of <hi>manah</hi> which
signifiech to number: and first they would haue signified the numbring of the yeares of his
kingdome, then the dayes and tearme of his life: But this is too curious: and the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is of his kingdome: <hi>God hath numbred thy kingdome.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Bullinger</hi> taketh it to be according to the Hebrewe phrase, as they vse to say, <hi>claman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
clamauit,</hi> in crying he cried: <hi>moriendo morieris,</hi> in dying thou shalt die, which phrase is
vsed for more vehemencie of speach.</p>
                        <p>3. But there is beside an allusion here vnto the manner of taking account, and numbring:
men for fayling will number twice, to be sure that they number right: so by this twice num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring,
is signified that God had most exactly nnmbred the tearme of his kingdome: so R.
<hi>Saadia,</hi> whom <hi>Polanus</hi> followeth: so also <hi>Calvin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Iunius</hi> thinketh that by <hi>numbring</hi> is meant, the singular care which God had of that
kingdome: <hi>singulari quadam ratione curatum est,</hi> that God after a singular manner tooke
care thereof, as they vse to doe, which haue things in number and account: but it rather shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that the time and tearme of his kingdome was determined: as the next words declare,
and <hi>hath finished it: sic Lyran. Hugo. necesse est vt finem accipiat,&amp;c.</hi> now his kingdome must
needes be at an ende, because it is fulfilled, <hi>Caluin.</hi>

                        <head>Quest. 34. Of the meaning of the word
Tekel.</head>
                        <p>1. <hi>Tekel</hi> signifieth <hi>he hath weighed,</hi> this phrase is taken from merchants or goldsmiths,
that vse most exactly to weigh their gold, and that which is light, they doe reiect and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse:
So God had most exactly tried and examined the life and workes of Balthazar, and
found them too light.</p>
                        <p>2. Some doe thus apply this similitude, as though the sinnes of Balthazar should be
weighed in one balance, which was pressed downe, and in the other which was light, his pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and vertue, which appeared to be verie small, <hi>Perer. Hugo</hi> thus expoundeth: God hath
weighed the time of thy life, <hi>iamillud declinare pronuntiat,</hi> and now he pronounceth it to
be declining, as a scoale that inclineth, and sinketh downe: But rather <hi>Balthazar</hi> is found,
beeing weighed against Gods iustice, to be in the light scoale, <hi>quasinullum pondus haberet,</hi>
as though he had no weight at all, as Daniel here expoundeth, <hi>Caluin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. Thus is this phrase vsed in Scripture, as Iob saith, c. 6. 2, 3. <hi>O that my miseries were laid
together in a balance, it would now be heauier then the sand of the Sea.</hi> His meaning is, that if
his miseries were valued in an equall iudgement, they would be found to be heauier then
they seemed to be: <hi>Pintus</hi> giueth this sense, as though Iob should thinke that his afflictions
beeing weighed against his sinnes, would be found too heauie for them: but Iob was farre
from accusing God of such iniustice, that his miseries and sorrowes laid vpon him, were grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then his sinnes.</p>
                        <p>4. But it will seeme strange, this phrase of weighing in a balance, beeing vsed to signifie
a iust examination, and triall, that Apocal. 6. 5. he which sate vpon the blacke horse, (whom
<hi>Pintus</hi> expoundeth to be the deuill) should haue a paire of balances in his hand: for it is farre
from Sathan to doe things in measure and weight: <hi>Pintus</hi> therefore giueth this sense: he is
said to haue a ballance, <hi>non quod illa vtatur, sed quod videatur vti,</hi> not that indeede he vseth
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:18834:84"/>
a iust balance, but seemeth to vse it: But the sense of the place rather is this, by the blacke
horse is signified dearth, famine, and scarcitie of all things: and by the balance, that by a
scant and exact weight their corne and food should be weighed vnto them.</p>
                        <p>5. In this interpretation two things are insinuated, 1. the examination and triall of Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thazar
in the iudgement of God: he was weighed. 2. then the euent and issue, he was found
too light, <hi>Polan.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>6. <hi>Deus non vtitur communi trutina,</hi> God vseth not here a common balance or scoale, he
hath a balance of his owne: though Balthazar might be approoued in the iudgement of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
yet Gods iudgement was otherwise, he found him too light, <hi>Calvin.</hi> like as the gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smith
vseth more exact weights then other Merchants and tradesmen, so the Lords exact
iudgement farre exccedeth mans.</p>

did thinke that these things might come to passe long after; or in honouring the Prophet he
might thinke to obtaine pardon of his sinne: But the citie beeing now besieged, if the king
had not beene altogether besotted, might haue put the king in minde of his present

Daniel.</head>
                        <p>The honours and fauours here conferred vpon Daniel, are either the ensignes of honour,
or the gouernement it selfe vpon which the other ornaments attended.</p>
                        <p>1. The ornaments of honour are two, purple raiment, and a chaine of gold. <hi>Lyranus</hi> here
noteth that there were fowre kind of ensignes and ornaments of estate: the purple to be or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pretious garment, a chaine, a ring of gold, and a crowne: all these things concurring to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
did signifie the regall dignitie: but beeing more or fewe, and not all, <hi>designabant
participationem honoris regij,</hi> they did but shewe the participation of the kingly honour, as
Ioseph had three of them, when he was aduanced of Pharaoh, a ring, costly raiment, and a
chaine of gold, Gen. 41. 42. but he had not the crowne or diademe. So <hi>Mordecai</hi> was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
with princely raiment, and a diademe, but mention is not made of the kings ring, and
chaine of gold, Esther. 6. 9.</p>
                        <p>2. The honour it selfe which is bestowed vpon Daniel, is, to be the third man in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
which <hi>Iosephus</hi> expoundeth, that the third part of the kingdome should be giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him: but that is not like that the king would giue away any part of his kingdom: <hi>Hierome</hi>
thinketh he was made one of the three, which was set ouer the kingdome, as cap. 6. 2. But if
Daniel had beene in that place before, then <hi>Darius</hi> needed not to haue aduanced Daniel
againe to be one of the three rulers. Therefore Theodoret taketh it, he was the third man in
honour and authoritie next to the king, so also <hi>Lyran,</hi> the king was the first, the Queene or

                        <head>41. Quest. v. 30. Whether Balthazar were slaine
at this time.</head>
                        <p>1. It is the opinion of some, that Balthazar was not slaine at all when the citie was taken,
but that Balthazar, called in forren histories <hi>Nabonidus,</hi> when the citie was besieged by Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,
did yeeld himselfe, and so he not onely obtained his life, but had a place of habitation as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
him in <hi>Carmania,</hi> where he died: thus seeme to write <hi>Alexander Polyhistor, Mega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sthenes,
Alpheus,</hi> as they are cited by <hi>Ioseph. l. 1. cont. Appion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But it is vntrue, that Balthazars life was spared, for the Scripture here euidently saith, that
he was slaine: this fauour indeede Cyrus shewed to his grandfather <hi>Astyages,</hi> whome he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
from his gouernment beeing a tyrant, as <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Iustinus</hi> write: it is not like,
that he would vse such clemencie toward his mortall enemie: at the least, if there had beene
any such thing, which would haue tended much to the praise and honour of Cyrus, <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon,</hi>
who is very large and lauish in setting forth the praise of Cyrus, in all likelihood would
not haue omitted it.</p>
                        <p>2. Wherefore the truth is, according to the Scripture here, that <hi>Balthazar</hi> was at this
time slaine: and thereunto agreeth <hi>Xenophon,</hi> that the king of Babylon himselfe was put to
the sword, when the citie was taken. <hi>lib. 7. de Cyri institut.</hi>

and the citie taken.</head>
                        <p>1. Some seeme to be of opinion, that this murther was committed vpon Balthazar a long
time before the taking of the citie by the Medes and Persians, about 17. yeare, before, whom
they say was slaine by the Babylonians, and one of the conspirators called <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi>
was chosen king in his place: and that this was done many yeares before Cyrus inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Babylon. This conceit they would ground vpon the report of <hi>Berosus</hi> and <hi>Megasthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</hi>
But they doe greatly mistake one thing for an other: for he which was so deposed by
the Babylonians, was <hi>Labosordach</hi> the sonne of Niglasar, or Neege-lasar, who had before
expelled <hi>Euilmerodach</hi> called <hi>Labinitus</hi> by <hi>Herodotus,</hi> together with his sonne <hi>Balthazar,</hi>
called also <hi>Labinitus</hi> the second, which name signifieth, a Prince expulsed: and because he
fled vnto the Medes, he was called <hi>Medus,</hi> a Median: this was not Darius then of the Medes,
which was set vp by the Babylonians, but <hi>Balthazar</hi> called Labinitus of the Medes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he liued an exile there, <hi>Iun. in commentar.</hi> see before, qu. 21. 9.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Iosephus</hi> saith, <hi>non multum abijt temporis,</hi> much time passed not after Daniel had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
this vision, when both the King and the citie was taken by Cyrus. If <hi>Iosephus</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,

                        <p>4. All these things are euident out of Scripture: 1. that Babylon, after 70. yeares of
the Iewes captiuitie, should be surprised and taken, Ierem. 25. 12. 2. that the king himselfe
should be slaine at the taking of the citie: as Isa. 14. 4. <hi>The oppressor shall cease. v. 22. I will cut

                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>d aliue, doe adde further, that when the King heard
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:18834:86"/>
that Cyrus was comming with a great armie to besiege Babylon, he fled to a citie called
<hi>Borsippa,</hi> and thither Cyrus pursued him, and besieged him there, who seeing that he could
not hold out, yeelded himselfe vnto Cyrus clemencie.</p>
                        <p>2. But <hi>Xenophons</hi> opinion, <hi>lib.</hi> 7. is more probable, that the king was taken at Babylon,
which is also most consonant to Scripture: for though it be not directly expressed, that he
was slaine in Babylon, yet it followeth by necessary collection, that that was the place, where
Balthazar was both depriued of his life and kingdome. 1. There was the kings palace, c. 4.
27. where the Chaldean kings vsually did reside. 2. there was the temple of Bel, where the
vessels of Gods house were laid vp, c. 1. 2. from whence they were brought vnto this riotous
feast: but they could not haue beene fetch from Babylon to an other place, seeing the citie
was now besieged by Cyrus. 3. and for the same reason so many nobles could not haue
beene gathered together. 4. nor yet the wise men of Babel assembled. 5. neither is it
like, that Balthazar beeing in such feare, would in that obscure place haue made such a feast,
whereas in Babylon he trusted to the defence of the citie.</p>

                        <p>1. Some thinke that Cyrus and Darius did homage vnto king Balthazar, and he thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
made this feast, whereat they were present: who when they heard the prophesie of Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,
and seeing the king and his nobles drunke with wine, tooke their opportunitie, and so set

secure, if his enemies had beene in his hand, but that he would haue made them sure.</p>
                        <p>2. Some are of opinion, that the <hi>Babylonians</hi> hearing Daniels prophesie, durst not resist
their enemies, but gaue vp the citie vnto them. <hi>ex Perer.</hi> but it is not like, if the citie had
beene yeelded vp, that Cyrus and Darius would haue made such hauocke of them, putting
the king and his nobles to the sword.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Iosephus</hi> saith, <hi>quod Cyro fortiter dimicante capta est Babylon,,</hi> that Babylon was taken,
Cyrus strongly assaulting it: but, though the citie were besieged, it seemeth by the great se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie
and feasting in the citie, that there was no such assault made.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Thomas</hi> thinketh, that seeing the Lord appointed by Cyrus to deliuer his people out
of captiuitie, that he by his power caused the riuers <hi>Tigris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates, subito siccari,</hi> of a
sudden to be dried vp: but seeing that neither in Scripture, nor in any forren writer any
such thing is spoken of, it is dangerous to imagine miracles without a good ground; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
the riuer <hi>Tigris</hi> was a great way distant from Babylon: God indeede did extraordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
assist Cyrus, as the Prophet saith, <hi>I will goe before thee, and make the crooked straight: I will
breake the brasen doores, and burst the yron barres,</hi> Isa. 45. 2. but of the drying vp of the riuer
the Prophet speaketh not.</p>
                        <p>5. Wherefore this is most probable, as both <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Xenophon</hi> write, that when
Cyrus saw that the citie was otherwise inuincible, he vsed this stratageme, he caused the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
Euphrates to be deuided into many chanels, and so made it passeable, and then his armie
passed ouer, and by the guiding of Gadata and Gobryas two of the kings chiefe courtiers,
they entred into the citie. <hi>Herod. l. 1. Xenoph. l.</hi> 7.</p>

                        <p>1. The Grecian historiographers doe ascribe this victorie and exploite in taking of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon
onely vnto Cyrus, as <hi>Herodotus, Xenophon:</hi> and the reason thereof is, because they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
therein the Persian histories, which ascribed the whole praise vnto Cyrus: and beside,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:18834:86"/>
as <hi>Strabo</hi> writeth, <hi>lib.</hi> 15. the Grecians did extoll the Persians beyond all other Barbarians,
of whome they obtained many noble victories, which made for their owne commendation.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Theodoret</hi> on the otherside, thinketh that Cyrus did not ioyne with Darius in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit:
and he giueth these two reasons thereof: 1. because their raigne is distinguished, c. 6.
28. <hi>Daniel prospered in the raigne of Darius, and in the raigne of Cyrus of Persia:</hi> but if they
had both ioyned together, it had beene but one and the same kingdome. 2. he that ioyned
with Cyrus, was <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> whome it is hard to prooue to be this <hi>Darius</hi> of the Medes: this
Darius was before <hi>Assuerus,</hi> and Cyrus was after: and thus <hi>Theodoret</hi> would infringe <hi>Iose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>
report.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. At this time, when Babylon was taken, the kingdome of the Medes and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians
is onely in <hi>Darius,</hi> who raigned not long, and then Cyrus succeeded: therefore their
raigne was distinguished. And that <hi>Darius</hi> held the kingdome of the Medes and Persians at
this time, is euident, c. 6. 15. <hi>Perer.</hi> 2. In the Greeke histories, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> writeth, <hi>Darius</hi>
is called by an other name: and it is no rare thing, for one to haue diuers names; and to be
called by one in the Scriptures, by an other in forren histories: as <hi>Ezra</hi> 4. the king which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
the building of the Temple, is called <hi>Assuerus,</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> who is the same, who
is named <hi>Cambises</hi> by other historiographers, the sonne of Cyrus: so the last king of the
Medes by <hi>Herodotus</hi> is said to be Astyages the sonne of Cyaxares, whome <hi>Diodorus</hi> calleth
<hi>Apanda,</hi> the other <hi>Astibara:</hi> so also this <hi>Darius</hi> may be the same, who is called Cyaxares
the sonne not of Astyages, but of <hi>Assuerus, c.</hi> 9. 1.</p>
                        <p>3. Wherefore <hi>Iosephus</hi> opinion is more probable, whome <hi>Hierome</hi> followeth, that Dari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
and Cyrus with the power of the Medes and Persians ioyned together in the siege of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel:
which best agreeth both to the prophesie of Daniel here, that the kingdome was giuen
to the Medes and Persians; and to the vision of the image, c. 2. where the second Monarchie
next vnto Babylon, is represented and set forth by the two armes of siluer, which signified
the two kingdomes of the Medes and Persians ioyned in one.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Xenophon,</hi> whome <hi>Iunius</hi> followeth in his commentarie, thinketh that although <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
was the chiefe procurer and beginner of this warre with the Babylonians, yet he himself
was not present in person, but staied at home to defend his owne kingdome of Media: but
by the wordes of the text here, that presently after Balthazar was slaine, <hi>Darius</hi> tooke the
kingdome, it appeareth, that he was present then to take the kingdome vpon him.</p>

Cyrus, and why mention is made onely
of Darius.</head>
                        <p>1. <hi>Herodotus</hi> maketh Cyrus onely the author and beginner of this warre, and the chiefe
contriuer of it; and <hi>Iunius</hi> seemeth to be of the same opinion in his commentarie: and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thinketh, that Cyrus spent one yeare in setling the kingdome of Babylon, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
resigned it to <hi>Darius</hi> called also Cyaxares: so that the first yeare of Darius raigne was
the second of Cyrus: but it is gathered rather by the text, that <hi>Darius</hi> tooke vpon him the
kingdome immediatly after the taking of the citie, and then began to raigne.</p>
                        <p>2. The more probable opinion then is, that <hi>Darius</hi> was the chiefe author and beginner
of this battell, and that thereunto he vsed the helpe of Cyrus then President of Persia: so
<hi>Xenoph.</hi> and <hi>Iosephus</hi> faith, <hi>when Darius did extinguish the Empire of Babylon, adiutus à Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,
he was assisted by Cyrus.</hi> And this is most agreeable to the Scripture, which maketh the
Medes the chiefe in this siege: Isa. 13. <hi>I will stirre vp the Medes against thee:</hi> and, Ier. 51. 11.
<hi>The Lord hath raised vp the spirit of the king of the Medes.</hi> So that the chiefe authoritie and
power was in the Medes, but the dexteritie in expediting of this busines, and in vsing that
stratageme in deuiding the riuer, is ascribed vnto Cyrus.</p>
                        <p>3. The victorie then is specially ascribed vnto Darius, though it were atchieued and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

old, Cyrus beeing a young man. 2. he was Cyrus great vnkle, his grandfather Astyages
brother, and beside, as some thinke his father in law. 3. and now the chiefe dominion was
in the Medes, from whome it was translated after Darius death, by Cyrus to the Persians.</p>

                        <head>48. Quest. Of the cause of this Babylonian warre.</head>
                        <p>1. <hi>Heaodotus</hi> thinketh it was onely Cyrus ambition, and immoderate desire of enlarging
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:18834:87"/>
his dominion, that made him enterprise this battell: but this was not the chiefe cause: for
Cyrus was but an assistant and associate vnto <hi>Darius</hi> in this exploit, as is before shewed.</p>
                        <p>2. The author of the scholasticall historie imagineth this to be the cause, that the mother
of <hi>Baltbazar,</hi> for whose cause those hanging orchards were made in Babylon, was this Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius
daughter; and now Balthazar hauing no sonne, Darius attempted to inuade the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
Balthazar yet liuing. But this is not like: for Darius could pretend no title at all by this
pretext vnto the kingdome, especially Balthazar, the right heire of the kingdome, beeing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue.</p>
                        <p>3. That cause is more probable, which is alleadged by <hi>Xenoph. lib.</hi> 1. that the king of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon
combining himselfe with the kings of Asia, was purposed to haue warred against the
Medes, who had then the chiefe dominion: and therfore <hi>Darius</hi> to preuent him, first setteth
vpon Babylon.</p>
                        <p>4. But what cause soeuer mooued them, the speciall stirrer and instigator to this battell,
was the Lord himselfe: as Ierem. 14. <hi>The Lord hath broken the rodde of the wicked, and the
scepter of the rulers:</hi> and Ierem. 51. 11. <hi>The Lord hath raised vp the spirit of the king of the
Medes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>5. For the Lord was prouoked by the sinnes of Babel, and therefore brought this desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and destruction vpon them: which sinnes were these, 1. their crueltie and oppression:
Isa. 14. 6. <hi>which smote the people in anger with a continuall plague, &amp;c.</hi> And they were not
onely cruell toward other nations, but specially against the people of God, when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
their citie and Temple: and therefore Ieremie saith, c. 51. 11. <hi>It is the vengeance of
the Lord, and the vengeance of his Temple.</hi> 2. An other of their great sinnes, was their su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition
and idolatrie, Ierem. 51. 44. <hi>I will visit Bel in Babel.</hi> v. 52. <hi>I will visit her grauen i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages.</hi>

the which they were punished. Isa. 47. 9. <hi>They shall come vpon thee, &amp;c. for the multitude of

                        <head>49. Quest. Whether Babylon was at this time finally destroyed according
the predictions of the Prophets.</head>
                        <p>1. The Prophets spake of an vtter ouerthrow and subuersion of Babylon: as Isa. 13. 19.
<hi>Babel the glorie of kingdomes, and the beautie and pride of the Chaldeans, shall be as the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of God in Sodome and Gomorrha: it shall not be inhabited for euer, &amp;c.</hi> and c. 14. 23. <hi>I
will make it a possession for the hedgehogge, and pooles of water, and I will sweepe it with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
of destruction, saith the Lord.</hi> Ierem. 50. 23. <hi>Babel is become desolate among the nations,
&amp;c.</hi> But at this time Babylon was not brought to such desolation: for it continued after the
raigne of Darius and Cyrus to the times of Alexander, beeing then a citie of great riches and
power.</p>
                        <p>2. Some to winde themselues out of this straight, doe make an allegorie of these prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
predictions: whome <hi>Hierome</hi> iustly reprehendeth in his commentarie vpon the 13. c.
of Isa: for if still vpon euery doubt and obiection, men should flie vnto allegories, there
would be no certentie of any thing.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Calvin</hi> to dissolue this knot, saith, that Babylon was subdued twice, once by Cyrus and
Darius the Mede, then afterward by Darius Hystaspis, by the helpe of <hi>Zopyrus,</hi> when 3000.
of the nobles were hanged vp, and many other put to the sword. But although this second
taking of Babylon were more cruell and grieuous then the other, yet neither at this time was
it finally ouerthrowne, as is before shewed.</p>
                        <p>4. Wherefore it must be considered, that these prophecies were not fulfilled all at once,
neither was Babylon at the first brought to vtter desolation, but by degrees. 1. it was sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised
by Cyrus and Darius, and depriued of the Empire and dominion. 2. afterward it
was defaced by Darius Hystaspis, when they rebelled, and the walls were broken downe to
the ground. <hi>Herod. lib. 3. Iustin. lib.</hi> 1. 3. after this, not farre from Babylon by Seleucus Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canor
was built the citie <hi>Seleucia,</hi> and by the Parthians the citie <hi>Ctesiphon, Plin. lib. 6. c.</hi> 26.
and so Babylon was almost exhaust by this meanes of the inhabitants. 4. In the Emperour
Adrians time, as <hi>Pausanias</hi> writeth, <hi>lib.</hi> 8. Babylon <hi>nihil praeter muros reliqui habet,</hi> had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:18834:87"/>
left but the walls. 5. In <hi>Hieromes</hi> time, as he writeth from the report of an <hi>Elamite,</hi>
the walls of Babylon onely serued to keepe in wild beasts for the kings game: and so he saith
<hi>vsque in praesentem diem prophetia Babylonis impletur,</hi> euen vnto this day, the prophecie on
Babel is fulfilled: Isa. 13. 20. <hi>Neither shall the Arabian pitch his teuts there, neither shall the
shepheards make their folds there.</hi> And so accordingly it was fulfilled, as <hi>Hierome</hi> saith, <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multitudine
bestiarum &amp; daemonum nullus pastorum audet intrare,</hi> by reason of the multitude
of beasts and of deuills, (and vncleane spirits that there haunted) no shepheard durst enter

                        <p>1. Of the first opinion are diuers, one disagreeing from an other: <hi>Berosus</hi> from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of Nabuchadnezers raigne to the ende of <hi>Balthazars,</hi> counteth but 65. yeares, as <hi>Iose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>

these: which sheweth that the Chaldeans should rule ouer nations 70. yeares, Ierem. 25. 11.
and so long the Iewes should be in captiuitie vnder them: but their captiuitie began vnder

                           <hi>Paulus Orosius</hi> affirming that <hi>Babylon</hi> was taken by Cyrus at the same time when the
kings were expelled out of Rome, which was in the 67. Olympiade, extendeth the Chaldean
Monarchie 60. yeares beyond the due time; for Cyrus is held to haue begun to raigne in the
58. Olympiade.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Pererius</hi> holdeth that the Chaldean Monarchie endured 88. yeares, which he sheweth
thus: the captiuitie of the Iewes began in the 18. yeare of Nabuchadnezer, when Ierusalem
was taken, which continued 70. yeares; vnto this summe must be added 18. yeares, which
were runne before of Nabuchadnezers raigne. But herein is <hi>Pererius</hi> error, he beginneth the

                        <p>4. Therefore the true account is this: the 70. yeares captiuitie beganne when <hi>Ieconia</hi> was

c. 32. 1. of the 12. yeare. c. 29. 17. of the 27. yeare: all which yeares are accounted from the
captiuitie of Iechonia, as is euident c. 1. 2. which was in the 8. yeare of the raigne of Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezer,
2. king. 24. 12. for then must begin the account of 70. yeares: vnto which must
be added 8. yeares of <hi>Nabuchadnezers</hi> raigne, which were expired before: so the whole

                        <p>2. The more common opinion is, that Nabuchadnezzer raigned 45. yeares, Euilmerodach

the captiuitie of Babylon 430. yeares: from thence to the comming of Christ 490. yeares:
the kingdome of Athens from <hi>Cecrope</hi> to <hi>Codrus,</hi> continued 490. yeares: and so long the
commonwealth of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> from <hi>Lycurgus</hi> to the ende and subuersion thereof:
Some kingdomes continued but halfe the time of this periode, as the kingdome of Israel in
Samaria 262. yeares: the Persian Monarchie 230. the kings among the Romanes raigned
245. yeares.</p>

                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. First they can define no certaine periode of kingdomes: some will haue 500.
yeares the periode, some 700. some an 120. yeares: and here before diuerse examples are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
of vnlike continuance.</p>
                        <p>2. The examples are impertinent: the Assyrian Empire is held to haue continued aboue a
1000. yeares: the state of the Iudges exceeded not 300. yeares: the 490. yeares till the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

in the commonwealth of the Iewes.</p>
                        <p>3. But many contrarie examples may be produced: the Romane state after the kings were
expelled, vnder Consuls and Dictators eudured aboue 600. yeares: The dominion of the
Turkes hath borne sway a 1000. yeares, the kingdome of France hath continued a 1200.
yeares: the state of Venice 800. And for short continuance, the Monarchie of the Athenians
exceeded not 50. yeares: nor the Chalde Empire many aboue 70. This therefore is a vaine
obseruation, of any such certaine and definite periode of kingdomes.</p>
                        <p>4. Further in that this Chaldean Monarchie was dissolued because of their iniquitie, two
other errors are met withall. 1. of them which thinke that the alteration and change of king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
is ruled by the constellations, and aspects of planets: the Chaldeans were very expert
in such contemplations, who could foresee no such thing, that their Monarchie was so neere

that by an ineuitable necessitie, which dependeth vpon the connexion and concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of certaine secundarie causes, commonwealths come vnto their fatall ende: We see in

writing of his owne hand, which dissolued the Babylonian state for the iniquitie thereof.</p>

                     <p>IN this chapter is set forth the miraculous deliuerance of Daniel from the lyons, with the
occasion thereof going before, and the effects that followed.</p>
                     <p>It hath three parts. 1. a narration of Daniels dignitie and honour. 2. the enuie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
raised against him, with the effects to v. 21. 3. the deliuerance of Daniel, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
he was brought thorough enuie.</p>

                        <pb n="173" facs="tcp:18834:90"/>
1. Daniels dignitie is described. 1. by the efficient cause and author of his aduancement,
the king, v. 1. 2. by the degrees of his honour. 1. he was one of the three set ouer the
120. gouernours. 2. he was made the first and cheife of the three, v. 3. 3. the king pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to set him ouer the whole kingdome.</p>
                     <p>2. Hereupon Daniel is enuied, enuie bringeth forth malitious practising against Daniel,
which is of two sorts. 1. they practise but preuaile not, v. 4. 2. they practise against Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
and preuaile: where first is set forth their consultation, v. 5. 2. the putting the same in
practise: where these three things are shewed. 1. the enacting of a law to entrappe Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,
v. 11. 2. the vrging of the lawe to v. 16. 3. the execution of the lawe, in the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of Daniel, with the effects thereof.</p>
                     <p>1. In the making of the lawe, there is 1. their petition to the king, to make a lawe, v. 5.
and to ratifie it. 2. the kings condescending, v. 9.</p>
                     <p>2. The law is vrged: where 1. is set forth the matter of their accusation: they found Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel
praying: the manner of whose prayer is described, v. 10. see quest. 12. following. 2. the
manner of their accusation, which containeth a generall repetition of the law made, v. 12. &amp;
a particular accusation against Daniel, with false suggestions, v. 13. 3. the kings endeauour
to deliuer Daniel, v. 14.</p>
                     <p>3. The execution followeth, 1. with the cause thereof, the vrging of the Princes, v. 15.
2. the manner: the kings commandement goeth before, in the instant the king vseth comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
words, v. 16. and afterward to make all sure, he and the princes seale the stone of the
lyons caue or denne, v. 17. 3. then followe the effects. 1. the kings heauines shewed by
three effect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, the refusing of his meate, of his delight and of his sleepe, v. 18. 2. the kings
earely rising. 3. and friendly salutation of Daniel.</p>
                     <p>Then followeth the third part: Daniels deliuerance with the manner thereof, see after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
quest. 23. And the effects which followed which were fowre. 1. the king reioyceth,
v. 23. 2. Daniel is deliuered without any hurt at all, v. 23. 3. his accusers are cast into the
lyons denne; the manner is expressed, who were cast into the lyons denne, and how it befell
them, their bones were broken in peices before they came at the ground, v. 24. 4. the kings
decree concerning the worship of Daniels God: the parts and order where of see, qu. 29.</p>

                     <p>1. And it pleased (<hi>before. C.</hi>) Darius to set (<hi>and he set. C.</hi>) ouer the kingdome an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth

                     <p>2. And ouer these <hi>he set,</hi> three rulers, of whom Daniel was the chiefe (<hi>one. V. L. S. G. B.</hi>
but (<hi>one) signisieth here the first, as the next verse sheweth</hi>) that the gouernours might giue

                     </p>
                     <p>3. Now Daniel was preferred (<hi>excelled. V. was superior. L.</hi>) aboue the rulers and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
because the spirit (<hi>of God. L. B. ad</hi>) was excellent in him: and the king thought to set
him ouer the whole realme.</p>
                     <p>4. Wherefore the rulers and gouernours fought (<hi>were seeking. C.</hi>) to find occasion against
Daniel on the behalfe (<hi>on the side. C. in the businesse. V. in the administration. I.</hi>) of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
but they could finde none occasion, not fault: for he was so faithfull, that there was
no blame nor fault found in him.</p>
                     <p>5. Then said these men, we shall finde no occasion against this (<hi>to this. C. L.</hi>) Daniel ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
we finde <hi>it</hi> against him concerning (<hi>in. C.</hi>) the lawe of his God.</p>
                     <p>6. Then these rulers and gouernours went together (<hi>craftely assayled. V. L. thronged tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuously.
A. so the word (pagash) signifieth, as Psalm.</hi> 2. 1.) to the king and said thus vnto
him, king Darius liue for euer.</p>
                     <p>7. All the rulers of the kingdome, the officers and gouernours, the counsellers and dukes,

                     <p>11. Then these men thronged together, and found Daniel praying, and making supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                     <p>12. So they came and spake vnto the king concerning the kings decree: Hast thou not

                     <p>13. Then answered they, and said before the king: This Daniel, which is of the children
of the captiuitie of Iudah, hath no respect (<hi>putteth no respect. C.</hi>) to thee O King, nor to the
decree, which thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day.</p>
                     <p>14. When the king heard these words, he was much displeased (or <hi>grieued. I. L. much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
was. C.</hi>) with himselfe (<hi>about it. V.</hi>) and set his heart on Daniel to deliuer him, and he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
till the Sunne went downe to deliuer him.</p>
                     <p>15. Then these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>en assembled (<hi>vnderstanding. L.</hi>) vnto the king, and said vnto the king:
Vnderstand O king, that the lawe of the Medes and Persians <hi>is,</hi> that no decree or statute,
which the king confirmeth, may be changed.</p>
                     <p>16. Then the king gaue charge (<hi>said. C.</hi>) and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the
denne of Lyons: now the king spake and said vnto Daniel, Thy God, whom thou seruest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually,
he will deliuer thee.</p>
                     <p>17. And a stone was brought, and laid vpon the mouth of the denne, and the king
sealed it, with his owne signet, and the signet of his Princes, that the purpose should not be
changed (not <hi>nothing should be done against. L.</hi>) concerning Daniel.</p>
                     <p>18. Then the king went into his palace, and remained fasting (<hi>passed the night, or continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all night without his supper. C. V.</hi> not <hi>he slept. L. for the contrarie is expressed afterward,
that his sleepe wont from him</hi>) neither were the instruments of musicke (<hi>such things as might

                     <p>19. Then the king arose in the morning by breake of day, <hi>B. (with the light. C.</hi>) and
went with all hast to the denne of lyons.</p>
                     <p>20. And as he came nigh vnto the denne, he cried with a piteous, <hi>B. (lamentable. B.</hi>) voice
vnto Daniel: and the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel the seruant of the liuing God,
is not thy God (<hi>thinkest thou not, that. L. ad.</hi>) able to deliuer thee from the lyons?</p>
                     <p>21. Then Daniel said to (<hi>spake with. C.</hi>) the king, O King haue for euer.</p>
                     <p>22. My God hath sent his Angel, and hath shut (that is, <hi>the Angel</hi>) the lyons mouthes,
that they haue not hurt me: and therefore. <hi>I</hi> (better then <hi>for. L. B. G. as though it were a reason
of his deliuerance</hi>) integritie is found in me before him: and before thee O King haue I done
no mischiefe. <hi>I. L. V. (hurt. C.) I haue done thee no hurt. G. neuer offended thee. B.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>23. Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and spake that they should take Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
out of the denne: so Daniel was brought out of the denne, and no manner of hurt was
found vpon him, because he beleeued. <hi>G. (or trusted. B.</hi>) in his God.</p>
                     <p>24. Then the king commanded, and the men were brought, which had found accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
(<hi>accused accusations. C.</hi>) which <hi>were against</hi> Daniel, and into the denne of the lyons were
they cast, their children, and their wiues, and they were not yet at the ground of the denne,
when the lyons had mastrie ouer them, and brake all their bones in peices.</p>
                     <p>25. Then Darius the king wrote vnto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in
all the earth (<hi>world. G. lands. B.</hi>) Peace be multiplied vnto you.</p>
                     <p>26. I make a decree (<hi>a decree is propounded before me. C.</hi>) that in all the dominion of my
kingdome, men tremble and feare before the God of Daniel, for he is the liuing God, and
remaineth for euer, and his kingdome is incorruptible (<hi>shall not be corrupted. C.</hi>) and his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
shall be euerlasting.</p>
                     <p>27. He rescueth and deliuereth, and he worketh signes and wonders in heauen and in
earth: who hath deliuered Daniel from the power (<hi>hand. C. denne. L.</hi>) of the lyons.</p>
                     <p>28. So this Daniel prospered in the raigne of Darius, and in the raigne of Cyrus the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian.

the kingdome of Babylon.</head>
                        <p>1. The author of the scholasticall historie reporteth this to haue beene the opinion of
some, that this <hi>Darius</hi> should be Balthazars grandfather by the mothers side, the sonne of
his daughter, who seeing that <hi>Balthazar</hi> had no children, he thought by this attempt to cut
off Balthazar, and so to possesse the kingdome of Babylon. But this is very vnlike, seeing <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
was so well affected vnto Cyrus beeing but his nephew, that he should be so vnnaturall
to his grandchild.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Theodoret</hi> thinketh, that this <hi>Darius</hi> was grandchild to Nabuchadnezzer by his
daughter, and so he was a Chaldean by his mother, and a Mede by his father: and this he
would thus prooue, because the kingdome was promised to Nabuchadnezzer, to his sonne,
and his sonnes sonne, Ierem. 25. 6, 7. now Balthazar was Nabuchadnezzers sonne, the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
then must according to that prophecie descend yet a degree further to some of Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzers
stocke, namely vnto this <hi>Darius.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra. 1. Balthazar,</hi> as hath beene shewed before, was not sonne, but sonnes sonne to
Nabuchadnezzer: for Euilmerodach was his sonne which next succeeded in the kingdom, 2.
king. 25. 27. 2. seeing the kingdome was promised to his sonne, and sonnes sonne, this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie
could not be fulfilled in Darius, who is supposed to haue beene his daughters sonne,
not his sonnes sonne. 3. the kingdome descended not to Darius by inheritance, but was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by conquest. <hi>Perer.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. A third opinion is, that this Darius was he which was called <hi>Darius Hystaspis,</hi> who
did warre with the Chaldees, and tooke their citie Babylon, and spoiled it: of this opinion
was <hi>Porphyrius,</hi> as <hi>Hierome</hi> saith <hi>in 9. Daniel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> and <hi>Tertullian. lib. advers. Indae. Cyril. Hierosol;

these are greatly deceiued, 1. because betweene this Darius the Mede, and Darius Hystaspis
there was great difference: for the first was a Mede, the sonne of Assuerus the king, c. 9. 1.
and raigned before Cyrus: the other was a Persian, not the sonne of a king, and he raigned
the third after Cyrus. 2. And herein is their error, Babylon was twice taken, once by Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius
and Cyrus together, and afterward by <hi>Darius Hystaspis</hi> by Zopyrus meanes.</p>
                        <p>4. Some other were of opinion, that this Darius was the same with <hi>Cyrus,</hi> because the
Greeke historians ascribe this victorie and taking of Babylon onely vnto <hi>Cyrus,</hi> which Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
giueth vnto <hi>Darius: Theodoret</hi> maketh mention of this opinion in the beginning of his
sixt oration vpon this booke: But this opinion hath no probabilitie. 1. <hi>Darius</hi> was a
Mede, but <hi>Cyrus</hi> was of Persia. 2. Darius was now 62. yeares old, and is thought to haue
raigned but a short time after, not aboue a yeare or two: but Cyrus was neither so old, held
not then to be aboue 40. and he raigned diuers yeares after. 3. And c. 6. 28. Darius and Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus
are named, as two diuers persons.</p>
                        <p>5. It was the opinion of some, as <hi>Hierome</hi> writeth vpon the 5. chap. of Daniel, that this
<hi>Darius</hi> was the same, who in <hi>Herodotus</hi> is called <hi>Astyages:</hi> of which opinion <hi>Eusebius</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to be, who maketh Astyages the last king of the Medes. And this seemeth to be fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the Apocryphal storie of Susanna, v. 65. that when <hi>Astyages</hi> was put or laid vnto his
auncestors, <hi>Cyrus</hi> of Persia tooke his kingdome.</p>
                        <p>But this opinion may thus be refelled: 1. because none of the forren writers doe make
any mention, that Astyages had any warre with the Chaldeans, or that he tooke Babylon.
2. And this Apocryphal storie may be doubted of: for according to Xenophon, <hi>Cyaxares</hi>
raigned after <hi>Astyages:</hi> and as <hi>Herodotus</hi> writeth, Cyrus expelled Astyages out of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and sent him to Carmania, and so tooke vpon him the kingdome while he liued: the
storie of Susanna agreeth with neither of these reports.</p>
                        <p>6. The most generall receiued opinion is, that this <hi>Darius</hi> called <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> was, as Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon
writeth, the sonne of Astyages, and vncle by the mothers side to Cyrus, which Cyaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
was king of the Medes after Astyages: this opinion followeth <hi>Iosephus, Hierome, Lyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,
Pintus, Oecolampad. Osiander,</hi> with others. But this is obiected against this opinion: that
<hi>Astyages</hi> had no sonne, but a daughter, <hi>Mandane,</hi> the mother of Cyrus, whome Astyages
commanded to be slaine, because the Astrologers told him, that he should haue dominion
ouer all Asia. And this is affirmed by diuers authors, that Astyages had no sonne, as <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius

was slaine by the Babylonians, and then this Darius the Mede, the same who is called <hi>Nabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nidus,</hi>
was by a common consent chosen king in his place, who when he had raigned 17.
yeares in Babylon, was ouercome by Cyrus, and the citie taken. <hi>Iunius</hi> also in his <hi>annotation</hi>
vpon this verse, saith that this Darius the Mede, is the same who is called by the historians,
<hi>Labonidus,</hi> or <hi>Labynitus.</hi>

                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. If Labosardach and Balthazar were the same, beeing the sonne of Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzers
daughter, then was not the prophecie fulfilled, that the kingdome should be
giuen to Nabuchadnezzers sonne, and his sonnes sonne, for it was to his daughters sonne.
2. when Balthazar was slaine, <hi>Darius</hi> tooke the kingdom by force, it is not like they would
haue chosen him beeing a stranger vnto it. 3. after Balthazar was slain, the kingdom was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
betweene the Medes and Persians it did not then quietly descend vnto the Medes. 4.
The Prophet Isai saith, c. 13. 17. <hi>Behold I will stirre vp the Medes against thee:</hi> the Medes
then assaulted Babylon and tooke it by violence: a Mede came not vnto it by election. 5.
This <hi>Darius</hi> was king of the Medes and Persians, as it appeareth in the 6. chapter, how could
that be, if he raigned in Babylon, and was ouercome by the power of the Medes and Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans?
6. Concerning <hi>Iunius</hi> opinion, I preferre his iudgement in his commentarie vpon v.
11. 12. c. 5. that Balthazar is the same, whome <hi>Herodotus</hi> called <hi>Labunitus,</hi> or <hi>Nebonidus,</hi>
which signifieth a Prince expulsed: because he with his father were both expelled by <hi>Nigla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar:</hi>
Then <hi>Darius</hi> the Mede could not be that <hi>Nabonidus,</hi> or <hi>Labynitus,</hi> as he hath in his
annotation.</p>
                        <p>8. This then is the most probable opinion, that this <hi>Darius</hi> called also <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> was not
the sonne, but the brother of <hi>Astyages,</hi> and great vncle to Cyrus, the sonne of Cambyses
and Mandane Astyages daughter: this then was their genealogie: <hi>Assuerus</hi> or <hi>Cyaxares</hi>
the Elder had two sonnes, <hi>Astyages,</hi> and <hi>Cyaxares</hi> the younger, the same is this Darius, who
is said to be sonne of <hi>Assuerus,</hi> c. 9. 1. not of Astyages. Xenophon calleth <hi>Cyaxares</hi> Astya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
sonne, because he adopted him to succeede in the kingdome to preuent <hi>Cyrus. Iun. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan.</hi>
The author of the scholasticall historie much disagreeth not, who saith that <hi>Cyaxares</hi>
was not the sonne, but the kinsman of Astyages, whome he adopted to be his heire. This
Darius was also father in law to Cyrus, to whome together with his daughter, he resigned
the kingdome of <hi>Media. Iun.</hi>

                        <p>1. <hi>Pererius</hi> obserueth that he was called by 4. names: by Daniel he is named <hi>Darius:</hi>
by the <hi>Septuag.</hi> as <hi>Hierome</hi> saith, he was called <hi>Artaxerxes:</hi> by Xenophon <hi>Cyaxares:</hi> and in

to be giuen vnto him, but <hi>Astyages</hi> he is not called either by <hi>Herodotus</hi> or <hi>Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophon:</hi>
it is rather an error in that Apocryphal storie.</p>
                        <p>2. The names <hi>Cyaxares</hi> and <hi>Assuerus</hi> are in effect all one: for <hi>Chu</hi> in the Persian language

                        <p>1. <hi>Xenophon</hi> writeth that <hi>Darius</hi> was the chiefe author of the warre against Babylon,
and therein vsed the helpe of Cyrus, who beeing sent with the greatest part of the armie to
the siege, Darius himselfe staied in Media, to whome Cyrus came afterward, when he had
setled the Babylonian affaires, to whome Darius offered the kingdome of Media together
with his daughter, and Cyrus againe gaue vnto Darius the gouernment of Babylon with the
goodly palace, and other edifices there: this report followeth <hi>Iunius</hi> in his commentarie. But
it is not like, that Darius was now absent, seeing it is saide, that immediately after Balthazar
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:18834:92"/>
was slaine, <hi>Darius</hi> tooke vpon him the kingdome.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>R. Levi</hi> thinketh, that <hi>Darius</hi> was present, and that he afterward continued in Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,

seemeth to encline to the same opinion: for Daniel when he was cast into the lyons den

                        </p>
                        <p>4. Now it beeing agreed that both Darius and Cyrus were both at this siege and taking
of Babylon, some thinke that <hi>Cyrus</hi> had the dominion, <hi>sed pro sua modestia cessit titulo regni,</hi>
but in his modestie gaue vnto Darius the title of the kingdome, beeing his vncle and father

<hi>it a vt post eum regnaret,</hi> so that he might raigne after him: But, seeing Cyrus, when he
had expulsed Astyages king of the Medes, established <hi>Cyaxares</hi> his vncle in the kingdom for
his life time, <hi>Iun. ex Xenoph.</hi> who now held the same, and was taken for the king of Med<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Cyrus was contented that Darius as in the right of his kingdome, who also was the chiefe
author of this warre, should haue the honour of this victorie, and the dominion of Babylon:
and thus thinketh <hi>Hierome</hi> that not onely <hi>ordo aetatis &amp; propinquitatis, sed regni seruatus est,</hi>
that not the order of age, or affinitie, but of the kingdome was kept herein: because then
the kingdome of the Medes, was greater then the kingdome of the Persians. And this best a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth
vnto the Prophets, who make the Medes the chiefe enemies and assaulters of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,
Isa. 13. 17. and Ierem. 51. 11. <hi>Iosephus</hi> also maketh Darius the chiefe man in the siege

kinsman.</p>
                        <p>5. And herein more credit may be giuen to <hi>Iosephus</hi> in the histories which concerne his
owne nation, then vnto <hi>Herodotus,</hi> or <hi>Xenophon,</hi> vnto whome these two exceptions may be
taken.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi>Herodotus</hi> is thought to haue many fabulous reports, and therefore is commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>pater mendaciorum,</hi> the father of lies: and <hi>Xenophon</hi> in the praise of Cyrus is found some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
to exceede.</p>
                        <p>2. These two historians in diuers points are one contrarie to the other. <hi>Herodotus</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
Astyages the last king of the Medes: <hi>Xenophon</hi> nameth <hi>Cyaxares</hi> king after him: the
first saith Astyages had no sonne, but a daughter, the other saith Cyaxares was his sonne: the
first writeth that Cyrus expelled Astyages out of his kingdome, the other that he died, and
left it to his sonne. <hi>Herodotus</hi> saith that Cyrus was borne of obscure parentage, that he was
miserably slaine by Thomyris Queene of the Messagetes, that he raigned 29. yeares. <hi>Xenophon</hi>
saith that Cyrus was nobly borne of a Prince of Persia, that he died peaceably at home, and
raigned but seauen yeares.</p>
                        <p>6. The resolution then of this question is, that neither this Darius was chosen king by
the Babylonians, as <hi>Ioseph Scaliger,</hi> whose opinion is rehearsed before: nor yet was he altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>rex beneficiarius,</hi> a king by courtesie, as <hi>Iun.</hi> but as king of the Medes, which kingdome
indeede he held by Cyrus fauour, he ouercame Babylon, and translated the kingdome from
the Chaldeans to the Medes and Persians.</p>

first spent a whole yeare in the setling of the Babylonian affaires: and after a yeare resigned
the title of that kingdome to Darius: so the first yeare of Darius raigne, was the second of
Cyrus: which may be the cause, why mention is made onely of the first and third yeare of
Cyrus, and not of the second. So his opinion is, that Darius and Cyrus first yeare concurred
not together, but that Darius first yeare was Cyrus second. But this seemeth to contradict
the text, c. 6. 28. where <hi>Darius</hi> raigne is set before <hi>Cyrus:</hi> it is vnlike that Darius raigne then
began after Cyrus.</p>
                        <p>2. Some are of opinion, that <hi>Darius</hi> the Mede raigned diuers yeares in Babylon, before
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:18834:93"/>
Cyrus tooke the citie, of which iudgement is <hi>Iosephus Scaliger,</hi> as we haue seene before, qu.
1. 8. But this can not be: for as soone as the Babylonian Monarchie was dissolued, it was diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
presently betweene the Medes and Persians: the Medes did not possesse it before.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>R. Levi</hi> thinketh that Darius raigned the first yeare immediatly after the taking of
Babylon: but he raigned not the whole yeare: Cyrus succeeded the same yeare: which opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Oecolampadius</hi> fauoureth, because if Cyrus raigned not the first yeare, then the <hi>manumis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
and deliuerance of the Iewes should haue beene deferred after the 70. yeares were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired.</p>
                        <p>4. But the more probable opinion is, that Darius and Cyrus raigne concurred together,
and that the first yeare of the Persian Monarchie is indifferently ascribed to Cyrus and Dari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us:
for it is euident, that immediatly after the dissolution of the Babylonian state, Cyrus raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and it is called the first yeare of his raigne: as, c. 1. 21. <hi>Daniel was vnto the first yeare of
Cyrus:</hi> that is, he continued in Babylon, till that state was altered, and the kingdome was
translated to Cyrus: Beside, the 70. yeares of captiuitie, and the Babylonian Monarchie ended
together: then immediatly after the 70. yeares expired, Cyrus in his first yeare maketh an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
for the returne of the Iewes, Ezr. 1. 1. Now that this was the first yeare also of <hi>Darius,</hi>
is as euident, c. 9. 1, 2. in the first yeare of Darius, Daniel vnderstood that the 70. yeares were
accomplished: but if Darius first, had not beene likewise Cyrus first, the yeares were accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished
before. So they both raigned together, as <hi>Calvin</hi> faith, they did <hi>regnare in commune,</hi>
raigne in common, because the Medes and Persians are ioyned together, c. 6. 8. and the Edict
for the returne of the Iewes was made by them both, as <hi>Iun.</hi> noteth, 2. Chron. 36. 23. and

                        <head>5. Quest. Of the officers which Darius appointed, and the
reason thereof.</head>
                        <p>1. <hi>Darius</hi> appointed an 120. gouernours, according to the number of the Prouinces:
which were numbred afterward to an 127. Esth. 1. 1. Some thinke that the odde number of
seauen is here omitted, to make the number euen, <hi>Genevens. annot. Esth.</hi> 1. 1. But it is more
like that either more Prouinces were added afterward to the Persian Monarchie, or els all
the 127. were diuided among these 120. gouernours. All these might be diuided into three
parts, each of them containing 40. gouernours. And ouer all these were three other chiefe
ouerseers set to take account of them: to euery one there might be assigned 40. <hi>Bullinger.
Iosephus</hi> is deceiued, who trebleth this number, and saith that Darius appointed 360. gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
whome <hi>Freculphus</hi> in his Chronicle followeth, <hi>tom. 1. lib. 3. c.</hi> 18.</p>
                        <p>1. The reasons, why Darius made choice of these gouernours, were these. 1. Because
Darius was old, 62. yeares of age, and therefore he did appoint them to be his assistants in
the kingdome, <hi>Iun.</hi> 2. Because all things in the Commonwealth must be done in order:
<hi>intellexit absque ordine nullum regnum,</hi> he knew that a kingdome could not continue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
order. 3. Their office was to see, that the king sustained no damage, to see that the
lawes were obserued, and the kings reuenues were not wasted. The Latine interpreter rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
<hi>vt rex non sustineret molestiam,</hi> that the king might not be troubled: but that were, as
though the king gaue himselfe to his ease, and had care of nothing, which is not like, that a
king of so many Prouinces could be without care of the gouernment.</p>

                        <p>1. Though it ordinarily be more safe, for such gouernours to be appointed which are of
the same nation, because both the hearts of the people will be more inclined vnto such, and
the care and loue of such officers will be greater toward their countrey: yet in two cases it
may fall out to be better to appoint a stranger: 1. when as there are any singular and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie
parts of wisdome in such an one as there was in Daniel, more then is to be
found in any other. 2. where countries are subdued by conquest, it is not safe to commit
the gouernment to men of the same nation, least they might rebell: This was the Romane
policie, to make their owne citizens Proconsuls and Leiftenants ouer their Prouinces: And
in the same policie it was sometime enacted here in England, that no Irish man should be
made a Bishop in Ireland, least such beeing then popishly affected, might haue beene instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

                        <p>2. Likewise it is more safe for the Prince to haue his Senate and assemblie of Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,

Ioseph was a meanes that the kings reuenewes were greatly augmented and encreased. But
such must haue care, that they seeke not the kings profit, with the oppression of the subiects,

                        <p>1. Some thinke that these gouernours wrought vpon the kings ambitious humour, who
thought that Cyrus would obscure him: as <hi>Xenophon</hi> writeth, that <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> which was this
Darius, would say with teares, that Cyrus was more glorious then he: therefore they knew
that this decree would content the king, that none should be praied vnto for 30. daies but
himselfe. But they beside pretended the kings profit, that it was necessarie by this decree to
trie the obedience of his subiects, especially the Chaldeans, which were lately subdued, <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin.</hi>
that by this meanes Darius might be established in his kingdome. Not much vnlike vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this was the practise of <hi>Gryslerus</hi> gouernour of <hi>Austria,</hi> who to trie the affections of the

                        <p>2. Now how vniust this decree was, diuersly appeareth. 1. herein they first dishonour
the God of Israel, whose power they had experience of, though they knew him not, in deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                        <p>1. It seemeth that the decrees of the Persian kings were inuiolably kept, whether they

                        <p>Daniel turneth not himselfe toward Ierusalem, as hauing any confidence in the place, or
as though God were present more in one place then in another; but for these reasons. 1. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

                           </note> that when they were taken prisoners, and carried captiue into a
strange land, if they prayed toward the Temple, they should be heard, <hi>Lyran. Iun.</hi> And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
they were commanded, Deut. 12. to goe vnto the place which the Lord should choose;
from hence it is gathered, <hi>si non possent ad locum illum venire, saltem contra locum ipsum a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorarent,</hi>
if they could not come vnto that place, yet they should worship toward it.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Iustabat nunc annus septuagesimus, &amp;c.</hi> now the 70. yeare was at hand, when the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance
of the people was expected, &amp; therfore he prayed so much the more earnestly, <hi>Pel.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>3. By this meanes he shewed his faith and hope, <hi>se acquiescere in haeriditate promissa,</hi> that
he rested in the promised inheritance, <hi>Calvin.</hi> that the people should returne thither againe,
as Iacoband Ioseph beleeued, that they should be redeemed out of Egypt.</p>
                        <p>4. By this Ceremonie in looking toward the temple, where it was onely lawfull for them
to offer sacrifice, was signified the redemption by Christ, and that it is not lawfull, <hi>ad alium
mediatorem respicere in precibus praeter Christum,</hi> to looke vnto an other Mediator in our
prayers, beside Christ, <hi>Bulling.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>5. And hereby he shewed <hi>se non obliuisci populi sui, &amp;c.</hi> that he forgat not his people,
countrey, and religion, though he himselfe enioyed great honour, <hi>Polan.</hi> like as Moses for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooke

                        <p>6. <hi>Conspectus ille fuit instar flabelli, &amp;c.</hi> that prospect toward Ierusalem was a meanes the
more to enflame Daniels desire to the peoples deliuerance for the which he prayed: this he
did to helpe his owne infirmitie, not that God by opening the windowes that way, heard the

                        </p>
                        <p>7. Aud herein Daniel had the example of other holy men, as Dauid saith, Psal. 5. 8. <hi>I will
bow my selfe (or worship) toward thy holy temple, Polan.</hi>
                        </p>

                        <head>Quest. 15. Why Daniel prayed thrice in a day.</head>
                        <p>1. Daniel did not make choice of these houres, as though they were more specially
consecrated vnto praier, and by the circumstance of the time more holines and efficacie were
added thereunto; as the Romanists haue such a superstitious conceit of their canonicall
houres: And they say the Iewes obserued these three times, with more religious respect: as
the third houre, because then the holy spirit was giuen, the sixt houre, because then the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
serpent was lift vp in the wildernesse, and the ninth, because then the waters came out of
the rocke in Cades. And so Christians should obserue the same three times: the third houre,
when the Holy Ghost was giuen, the sixt, at what time Christ was crucified, and the ninth,
when the water gushed out of his side, <hi>Pintus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. But this was the reason rather, why Daniel obserued these times: he made choice of
such times, wherein he had best leisure, and was freest from worldly businesse, which was
the morning before he went abroad, at noone when he came home to eate meate, as Ioseph
also vsed to doe, Gen. 43. 16. and at night when all his businesse was ended, <hi>Iun.</hi> Besides,
these are the fittest times in respect of the benefits therein receiued of God, in the morning
to giue thankes for our deliuerance the night past, at noone, when we take our meat, and at
night for our preseruation that day, <hi>Calv.</hi> of these three times Dauid maketh mention, Psal.
55. 17. <hi>Euening, morning, and at noone will I pray: A Deo initium, felicem successum, beatum

                        <head>16. Quest. Whether Daniel did well in thus praying, to offer himselfe
to publike danger.</head>
                        <p>It will be obiected that Daniel might haue done better to haue prayed in secret. 1. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the kings commandement. 2. he should haue had herein some speciall reuelation.
3. he might haue prayed vnto God though he had not done it so openly, seeing the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
worship is not simply necessarie, but it is referred to the internall, whereby God will spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
be serued. 4. a wise man would haue giuen way to the present necessitie and obserued
the time. 5. by this meanes he might haue brought all the Iewes into danger, if God had
not extraordinarily deliuered him.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. The kings commandement was to be obeyed, so long as it was not contrarie
vnto Gods commandement, as in this case it was: for the Lord saith, <hi>call vpon me in the day
of trouble:</hi> but here the king forbiddeth that God should be called vpon. 2. Daniel herein
was guided by the spirit of God: yet he was not to expect any speciall reuelation, hauing
the generall word of God, as Deut. 6. 12. 13. <hi>beware least thou forget the Lord thy God, &amp;c.
thou shalt feare the Lord thy God, and serue him, &amp;c.</hi> and Deut. 8. 10. <hi>when thou hast eaten,
and art filled, thou shalt blesse the Lord thy God.</hi> 3. though the internall worship of God be
most necessarie, yet the other is necessarie also, as beeing a part of our outward confession
of God: as in this case it was necessarie, Daniel should thus testifie his worship of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it had beene his custome in former times, which if he had intermitted, <hi>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>isset obliqua
quaedam abiuratio, &amp;c.</hi> it had beene an indirect abiuring of his religion. 4. in ciuill matters
&amp; things indifferent, it is good to giue way vnto the time, but not in matters which concerne
the saluation of the soule. 5. he was rather to goe before his nation in constancie of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and to giue them a good example: whereas if he had dissembled, he might haue brought
them all into the same dissimulation: Daniel then herein doing his dutie, was not to giue ouer
in respect of any danger, but to leaue the successe vnto God.</p>
                        <p>But that Daniel did well in making this open confession of his faith, it appeareth by the
happie successe, Gods extraordinarie assistance, whereby the Lord approoued of Daniels
godly resolution. Beside if Daniel had done otherwise, he should haue diuersely offended. 1.
against God, in preferring the kings commandement before his. 2. against the law of nature,
which teacheth vs that God is to be worshipped. 3. against the true religion and worship
of God, which by his example should haue beene much hindred. 4. against the people of
God, in offending them with his inconstancie. 5. and against his owne conscience, if he had
for feare forbeared that, which in his iudgement he allowed, <hi>Iun. in comment.</hi>

against him.</head>
                        <p>1. First they lie in waite for Daniel: And there is both a multitude of them which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire
together, <hi>these men assembled,</hi> v. 11. and they finde Daniel in the verie manner, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vnto his God.</p>
                        <p>2. In their accusation is to be considered the forme of it, which is full of subtiltie, and
cunning: they doe not at the first directly accuse Daniel, because they knewe he was fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of the king: but first by making rehearsall of the decree in generall, they drawe from
the king a former consent, that afterward he should not goe backe: wherein they call three
things to the kings remembrance, the sum of the decree, the ratification, &amp; the penaltie. v. 12.</p>
                        <p>3. The matter of the accusation is against Daniel, which is not simply done, but with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse
false and enuious suggestions: Enuious concerning his person, in obiecting his captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and the action, in concealing to whom he made his petition: they simply propound it, <hi>he
made his petition three times a day:</hi> the king might conceiue that he might make it to some
other man: their suggestion is false; as though Daniel did it in contempt of the king lawes.</p>
                        <p>4. And their enuie further appeareth in these two things. 1. they omit to make menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Daniels vertues: they burie them all in obliuion, and picke what matter they can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, <hi>Pintus.</hi> 2. they forget that Daniel was their fellowe in office, which many times
is respected by men of like place and calling, <hi>Osiand.</hi>

is like he pleaded for him shewing what a necessarie man he was to the commonwealth, and

and Pilate would haue deliuered Christ, but he feared the displeasure of Caesar, as the

of the Rulers, for he <hi>lapsus est infirmitate,</hi> fell of infirmitie, <hi>Melancthon. illi accusant per in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidam,

this decree.</head>
                        <p>1. There is no question, but that the king ought to haue reuersed this vniust lawe, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
the custome was to the contrarie, whereby the innocent were condemned: like as it is
better to breake an vniust oath, then to obserue it: for then there is a double fault committed,
first in making an vniust oath, and then in keeping it: like as Dauid did well to reuerse his oth
of reuenge which he had made against Nabal; and Herode did wickedly in performing his
rash and vnaduised oath in killing Iohn Baptist, <hi>Pap.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. Darius then binding himselfe to strictly to his lawe, therein cannot be excused. 1. he
knewe in his conscience that it was a wicked decree, and against the glorie of God. 2. And
that it was made fraudulently to intrappe Daniel. 3. neither should he haue beene drawn to
be partaker of other mens sinnes. 4. And though his nobles resisted him, yet where he

&amp; confidenter,</hi> that Darius speaketh not doubtfully but boldly and confidently, &amp;c.
And this may seeme to be an argument that he prayed in faith, because his prayer was heard:
but Daniels deliuerance was not an effect of Darius prayer: the Lord had respect vnto his
owne glorie, and to Daniels innocencie; and he wisheth rather that God should deliuer him,
then affirmeth any thing, as <hi>Iunius</hi> translateth.</p>
                        <p>2. There appeareth in Darius, that he had here <hi>aliquam Dei cognitionem,</hi> some know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God, which he had learned of Daniel, <hi>Osiand.</hi> which is manifest both in that he
speaketh of Daniels God, that he and not any other god, was able to deliuer him: and then
in respect of Daniels person, because he was innocent he was perswaded God would deliuer
him, <hi>Iun.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. Yet this was farre from a faithfull prayer. 1. for then he would neuer haue suffred an
innocent man to be condemned. 2. he calleth him Daniels God, as though he were not his
God, <hi>Polan.</hi> 3. If he had prayed in faith, he would not onely haue wished well vnto Daniel,
but haue endeauoured by all his power to doe him good: for not good words, but good
workes are the fruits of faith, as S. Iames sheweth, c. 2. 16. <hi>Bulling.</hi> yet we may gather, <hi>non

with his owne seale.</head>
                        <p>1. The Latine interpreter readeth, <hi>he sealed the stone with his owne signet, and the signet
of his princes, ne quid fieret contra Danielem,</hi> least any thing should be done against Daniel,
whereupon the <hi>ordin. gloss.</hi> noteth following <hi>Hierome, de leonibus securus de hominibus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timescit,</hi>
the king beeing out of feare for the lyons, is afraide of men, &amp;c. he is afraide least
any of his enemies seeing the lyons to doe Daniel no harme, might haue practised against
him in the denne: and therefore he sealed the stone, <hi>ne introiret aliquis sine scitu suo,</hi> least a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
should enter without his priuitie, <hi>Lyran.</hi> to the same purpose also <hi>Bullinger</hi> and <hi>Pellican.</hi>
But the originall is otherwise, which is truely translated thus, <hi>that the purpose might not be
changed concerning Daniel.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. Therefore the meaning is this, that when these men perceiued, when Daniel was cast
into the denne, that the lyons stirred not at him, they doubting of the kings constancie, least
he should cause Daniel to be taken out aliue, or that some other of his friends might drawe
him out, Daniels accusers cause the king to seale the stone: and they not trusting to the kings
seale alone, put to their owne seales likewise, <hi>Iun. Polan.</hi>

so their opinion seemeth to be, that Darius as trusting in the power of God spake confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

it wil be said, that Darius here confesseth the liuing God, as beleeuing in the onely true God:

Gentiles so acknowledged, this then was no firme argument of his conuersion.</p>

did sticke as it were betweene hope and feare, <hi>Osiand.</hi> yet the manner of his speach sheweth

                        <p>Daniel sheweth both the causes efficient, the forme and manner, and ende of this his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance.
1. the principall cause of this his deliuerance was God: <hi>God hath sent:</hi> the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
cause, was the Angel: for though God can immediately deliuer his, without the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrie
of others: yet it pleaseth him to vse his angels, both for the setting forth of his owne
glorie, and the further consolation of his seruants.</p>
                        <p>2. The forme and manner is expressed, the Angel shut the lyons mouthes, that they had
no power to hurt Daniel. And not onely their mouthes were shut but herby is signified also,
that their talents and clawes were stayed from hurting him: and therefore it followeth, <hi>that
they haue not hurt me:</hi> so that they touched him neither with their teeth, clawes, tayle, or
by any other meanes, <hi>Iun.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. The end also is expressed: that by this meanes the innocencie of Daniel might appeare,
and the goodnesse of his cause, that he had not offended against the king, but had shewed
himselfe a true worshipper of God, <hi>Polan.</hi>

                        <head>Quest. 24. Of Daniels salutation to the king, O king
liue for euer.</head>
                        <p>1. This was the manner of salutation in the East countrey, to wish long life vnto their
king. Thus the Chaldeans, saluted Nebuchadnezzar, c. 2. 4. but in hypocrisie, wishing in
their hearts rather, that such a tyrant might perish. So c. 3. 4. they which accused Daniels
godly companions and brethren, doe with such words insinuate themselues to the king, as
flatterers: But Daniel doth wish vnto the king long life <hi>ex animo,</hi> from his heart, because it
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:18834:96"/>
is the dutie of subiects to pray for magistrates: yea he wisheth vnto him eternall life, <hi>gloss.</hi>

                        <p>2. He might haue expostulated with the king, because by his authoritie he was cast into
the lyons denne: but two reasons might mooue Daniel to forbeare all such reprehension. 1.
because he more respected Gods glorie then his owne particular cause; <hi>satis fuit eius liberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one
illustratam fuisse Dei gloriam,</hi> it was enough that Gods glorie was set forth by his deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance:
and therefore he is silent in the rest, <hi>Calvin.</hi> 2. According to S. Pauls rule, <hi>infirmum

                        <p>1. There are diuerse meanes whereby men haue resisted the rage and violence of lyons
1. As first by force and strength, as Samson killed a lion, and Dauid slewe a lyon and a beare
that inuaded his flocke: but so was not Daniel deliuered here: for the lyons might haue tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him before he came at the ground, as they did his accusers: and though resistance may be
made against one lyon, yet here were many. 2. Some haue conquered lyons by casting some
garment vpon their head,<note place="margin">lib. 8. c. 16.</note> and so as it were blindfolding them: as <hi>Plinie</hi> writeth how a <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulian</hi>

meanes <hi>Lysimachus,</hi> whom <hi>Alexander</hi> caused to be shut in with a lyon, might more easily
strangle him. 3. Some haue tamed lyons by vsing them gently while they were yet young,
and but whelpes, as <hi>Plinie</hi> in the same place maketh mention of <hi>Hanno</hi> the <hi>Carthaginian,</hi>
who (as he saith) <hi>primus hominum ausus est leonem manu tractare,</hi> the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>st of any durst han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
a lyon with his hand. 4. Beside lyons vse to shewe themselues kinde vnto those, which
haue shewed them any kindnesse,<note place="margin">Gellius lib. 5 c. 14.</note> as <hi>Aulus Gellius</hi> reporteth out of <hi>Appian,</hi> of a certaine ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
called <hi>Androdus,</hi> who was condemned to the wild beasts, and was spared of a lyon,
that remembred some former kindnesse he had receiued: and this he was an eye witnesse of
at Rome. 5. <hi>Plinie</hi> also writeth in the same place, that lyons vnlesse they be very hungrie, wil
spare those which are suppliant vnto them, <hi>&amp; mulceri alloquio,</hi> and that they are made gentle
with speach: as he maketh mention of a woman, which fell downe in the woods before a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
alleadging <hi>se indignam eius gloria praedam, &amp;c.</hi> that she beeing a silly weake woman, was
a prey vnworthie so noble a beast. But none of these meanes did Daniel here vse. 6. neither
yet as Daniels enemies obiected, did they spare Daniel because they were full before: as they
say a lyon will not prey vpon a man vnlesse he be verie hungrie: <hi>Iosephus</hi> addeth further, that
thereupon the king caused flesh to be cast before the lyons to feede them, and then cast Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niels
accusers into the denne, who notwithstanding beeing full did teare them before they
came at the ground: But this narration of <hi>Iosephus</hi> though it may seeme probable, is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie
to be receiued, seeing the Scripture hath it not.</p>
                        <p>2. But<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the lyons here were not bound by any such ordinarie meanes: this was Gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie
worke, wherein it pleased him to vse the ministrie of Angels: who diuersly as
<hi>Pererius</hi> coniectureth might stoppe the lyons mouthes. 1. as by remoouing the lyons into
some other place. 2. or by blinding their eyes. 3. or by slaking their hunger. 4. or by chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
their inward phantasie, which stirreth them vp to rage, when they apprehend that as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie
vnto them, which they deuoure. 5. or there might be a terror and feare striken into
them: as they say lyons naturally are afraid of the rumbling of wheeles, the crowe of a cocke,<note place="margin">lib. 2. de mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that they returned to their kind in falling vpon the accusers of Daniel, and breaking all their

                        <head>Quest. 26. Why the Lord doth not alwayes send
his children temporall deliuerance.</head>
                        <p>1. It is not sufficient for temporall deliuerance to haue a good cause: for thorough ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
vaine glorie, and vaine confidence, men may be carried to maintaine a good cause:
as <hi>Brutus</hi> that stood for the libertie of the commonwealth, because he had no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
successe, said in discontent, <hi>virtutem esse rem friuolam,</hi> that vertue was a friuolous thing:
he considered not that through his ambition, and trusting to his owne wit, he ouerthrewe a
good cause: so in this place, it was not Daniels innocencie onely that deliuered him, but the
cause was his faith, he trusted in God, <hi>Calvin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. God doth not alwayes deliuer temporally: As he suffered <hi>Ignatius</hi> to be torne of wild
beasts, and <hi>Polycarpus</hi> to be consumed of the fire: yea at sometime he sendeth the same man
deliuerance, and not at an other: as Peter was deliuered out of Herods hands at Ierusalem,
but he suffred vnder Nero at Rome: yet are not the children of God forfaken, for when they
are taken away by death, they then are most of all deliuered at once from all the calamities
of this world, and are receiued into euerlasting glorie, <hi>Bulling.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. There is then a threefold kind of deliuerance. 1. there is a temporall deliuerance from
death and danger here: as Daniel was now deliuered. 2. there is a deliuerance from sinne,
as in this place, <hi>Daniel liberatur à morte, Rex à peccato,</hi> Daniel is deliuered from death, the
king is freed from his sinne, <hi>Melancthon.</hi> 3. there is a deliuerance and preseruation to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
life: as the godly <hi>conseruantur ad vitam eternam,</hi> are so preserued, so that in death it selfe
they perish not, <hi>Osiand.</hi>

                              </gap>tus est amici nomine,</hi> he reioyced
on the behalfe of his friend, who was now deliuered by this great miracle, <hi>Oecolamp.</hi> and he
found his conscience somewhat quieted, which was perplexed and troubled before, when he
refused his meate, and would not heare the instruments of Musicke.</p>
                        <p>2. Yet this was but a carnall ioy; it was much differing from the true spirituall ioy, which
the children of God haue, when they are assured of the fauour of God, and of the remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their sinnes; whereof the Prophet Dauid speaketh, Psal. 4. 6. <hi>Lord lift thou vp the

                        </p>
                        <p>3. Yet this ioy of the king, and the sight of this miracle made the king more couragious
and bold; that whereas before he feared the nobles, and against his own conscience condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Daniel, now he deliuereth Daniel, and causeth them to be cast into the lyons denne in

                        <p>1. Some here doe answer, <hi>non est lex aequior vlla, quam neces artifices arte perire sua, &amp;c.</hi>
there is no more iust lawe, then for the deuiser of mischeife to perish in his owne deuise, as
Haman was hanged vpon the gallowes which he had made for <hi>Mordechai, gloss. iuterlin.
Hugo.</hi> this reason satisfieth why the authors of this mischiefe were punished, but not why
their wiues also and children should suffer with them.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Bullinger</hi> sheweth the equitie hereof by the like iudgements of God, as in the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the olde world, and of Sodome, and in Sauls expedition against Amalech: in all
these neither men, women, or children were spared: So it is vsually seene, that in warre, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
pestilence, the calamitie is generall: But there is great difference betweene the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God inflicted either immediately by himselfe, or by his commandement, which are
alwayes most iust, though we see not the reason thereof; and the iudgements of men. God

                        <p>3. <hi>Calvin</hi> graunting, that the wiues and children may for the sinnes of their husbands

                        <p>4. There are then foure things, which doe iustifie the kings sentence against Daniels ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers.
1. The greatnes of the offence, which deserued a great and extraordinarie punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
they sinned against God, by hatred of the true religion, against the king, in abusing his
facilitie, and deceiuing him, and they were false accusers against Daniel: they offended also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

the same punishment, which by their false testimonie, they would haue brought vpon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
according to Moses law, Deut. 19. 19. So the Lacedemonians did vse to put to death
false accusers, as the Athenians did flatterers. As these then by their false suggestions caused
Daniel to be cast into the lyons denne, so are they iustly serued themselues: And as they
would haue depriued the king of his friend, so they perish with their friends, <hi>Oecolampad.</hi>
3. The custome of nations is to be considered, which was for the treason committed against
the king or commonwealth, either against their honour or life, to punish both the offenders
themselues, and their posteritie: As this enterprise was both against the kings honour, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

ought to suffer their fathers punishment, seeing the like example is feared in them of that
hereditarie crime. The generall custome and law of nations, which was to punish the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

yet to this day the offender is punished in his posteritie, though not by death, yet by other
meanes; as by confiscation of his goods and lands, by tainting of the blood, disinheriting of
the children, the annihilating of all their acts and fraudulent conueyances. 4. It was iust for
example sake to shew such seueritie, that others should feare to doe the like. 5. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

the adiuncts of his kingdome, it is euerlasting, it shall neuer perish. 3. from his works and

not here well translated, the word is <hi>tzalach,</hi> which signifieth to prosper, not to continue;
and the preposition is not <hi>ghad,</hi> which signifieth to, or vntill, but <hi>beth,</hi> which is (<hi>in.</hi>)</p>
                        <p>2. The meaning then is, that he was honoured first by Darius in Media, who raigned not
long after the taking of Babylon: and after him he was in great reputation with Cyrus in
Persia.</p>
                        <p>3. But where it is said, c. 1. 21. that Daniel was <hi>vnto the first yeare of Cyrus:</hi> that is to be
restrained, not vnto the time of Daniels life, for he continued vnto the 3. yeare of Cyrus, c. 10.
1. but of his employment in the Chaldean Monarchie: that he was famous as long as that
Commonwealth continued: and in this place it is shewed, that in the Persian state he was
had likewise in reputation: and it is not vnlike but that he declared vnto Cyrus the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of Esai, and was a speciall instrument to hasten the deliuerance of his people.</p>
                        <p>4. How long Daniel remained vnto Cyrus, it is not certen: there is mention made in this
booke but of the third yeare: <hi>Bullinger</hi> thinketh he liued <hi>plures annos,</hi> many yeares vnder
Cyrus. But Daniel was now aboue an 100. yeare old, and it should seeme saw onely the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning

                        <p>5. Here is a secret <hi>antithesis</hi> or opposition betweene the Chaldean and Persian Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie:
vnder this Daniel prospered still, and was greatly honoured: but in the Chaldean state,
though he were honoured of Nabuchadnezzer, yet he was neglected of <hi>Balthazar,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth,

raigned vnder Darius, who tooke Daniel with him into Media, leauing Cyrus with his sonne
Cambyses at Babylon, as thinketh <hi>Oecolampad.</hi> though according to the opinion of some,
Cyrus was not yet married.</p>

or in Media.</head>
                        <p>1. <hi>R. Levi</hi> thinketh, that this fell out at Babylon, because Darius raigned but a short time
after the taking of Babylon, not full out a yeare: and to him agreeth <hi>Oecolampad.</hi> and so Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus
succeeded Darius in the very first yeare, for otherwise the 70. yeares of captiuitie beeing
expired, the deliuerance of the people should haue beene deferred: But all this may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
that either Cyrus succeeded Darius the very first yeare, or that they both raigned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and yet this should be no reason, that this miracle was done rather in Babylon, then
in <hi>Media. Amand. Polanus</hi> also thinketh that the accusers of Daniel were <hi>Babylonians, p.</hi>
468. and so this is to haue beene done in Babylon.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Iunius</hi> is of opinion, that Cyrus raigned one yeare in Babylon, when the Iewes were
sent out of captiuitie, and then Cyrus went to Darius into Media, and sent him to Babylon,
and resigned vnto him the kingdome thereof: and so Darius first yeare in his opinion was
Cyrus second, <hi>Iun. comment. in 5. cap. in fine.</hi> hence it will follow, that this miraculous acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
fell out in Babylon. But the text sheweth euidently that presently after Balthazar was
slaine, Darius tooke vpon him the kingdome: he was the next: and c. 6. 28. Darius raigne is
named before Cyrus raigne, it came not therefore after it: see before, qu. 4.</p>

Cyrus sonne. <hi>Bullinger</hi> agreeth, that Darius left Cyrus at Babylon, and tooke with him
Daniel to Ecbatane in Media: who vnderstood of the great wisdome that was in Daniel and
how he had interpreted the writing vpon the wall. This opinion that Daniel at this time
was in Media, not in Chaldea, seemeth more probable for these reasons. 1. the forme of
gouernment, which was brought in by Darius to set an 120. gouernours ouer his kingdome
belonged to the Persian, not to the Babylonicall state, as may be collected, Esth. 1. 1. where
mention is made of the largenes of Assuerus kingdome ouer an 127. Prouinces. 2. in this

not sufficient, to haue it inwardly in the heart.</head>
                        <p>v. 10. Daniel opened his windows to the intent that he should be seene of all, not of vaine
glorie, but that his constancie in the worship of God might be knowne to all, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the kings edict to the contrarie: Hereby is confuted the error of the Georgians, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,
and Nicodemites in these daies: the same was the error of the <hi>Helchesaites</hi> in times
past, that if any denied his faith in time of persecution, and kept it in his heart, he sinned not.
And for the strengthening of this error, diuers reasons are brought.</p>
                        <p>1. They alleadge, that the Magistrate, who is in Gods place, is to be obeyed, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
teacheth, that whosoeuer resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God, Rom. 13. 2.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. Magistrates as they are in Gods place, so they must command and rule ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the will and word of God: they haue not receiued an absolute power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
what they list, but limited according to the rules of Gods holy word. The Apostles
themselues refused to obey the Magistrates which enioyned them not to speake in the name
of Iesus, Act. 4. 19.</p>
                        <p>2. Men must haue care of their wife and children, whome wilfully for a man to forsake in
casting himselfe into apparant danger, it were impious.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> Wife and children ought to be loued, and cared for, but the loue of Christ must
be preferred: as our Sauiour saith, that he which loueth wife or children, more then me, is not
worthie of me, Matth. 10.</p>
                        <p>3. But the shedding of Christian blood should be preuented: men should not offer
themselues to apparant danger which giueth occasion of much bloodshed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. The constant seruants of God, are not the cause of bloodshed, but the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
persecuters, which kill them cruelly and vniustly: as our blessed Sauiour saith, Ioh. 16. 2.
<hi>Whosoeuer killeth you, will thinke he doth God good seruice: and these things will they doe vnto
you, because they haue not knowne me.</hi> 2. The very death of the righteous is pretious in
Gods sight, Psal. 116. 15. and God receiueth as much honour by the constant death of his
Saints, as he doth by their godly life. 3. Otherwise the holy Martyrs should be blameable,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:18834:100"/>
because by their constant profession, murther and bloodshed is occasioned: whose memorie
is honourable before God, and man: as <hi>Eusebius</hi> maketh mention of a certaine citie in Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,

sacrifices, and say they had sacrificed, and yet they did not: who notwithstanding were
reprooued, because they in silence suffered such crimes to be obiected: but some would crie
out,<note place="margin">Homil. 25. in Matth.</note> they had not sacrificed, but were Christians. 3. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> hath an excellent tractate of
this, or who els was the author of that imperfect work vpon Matthew, that we must confesse
Christ with all our senses: and if a man faile in any of them, it is no perfect confession of
Christ: As, though thou doest not eate of things sacrificed to idols, if thou doe but looke
vpon them how beautifull they are, <hi>oculis negasti Christum,</hi> thou hast denied Christ with
thine eyes: If one say vnto thee, doe but heare how such an one blasphemeth Christ: if thou
hearken, <hi>iam auribus tuis negasti Christum,</hi> now thou hast denied Christ with thine eares: If
it be further said, doe but stay and smell the incense offered to idols, if thou smell, <hi>odoratu tuo
Christum offendisti,</hi> thou hast offended Christ with thy smell: If thou eate not, but seeme to
tast, or touch the idolatrous sacrifices, <hi>gustu, tactu tuo Christum abnegasti,</hi> by thy tast, by thy
touching thou hast denied Christ.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Pappus</hi> here sheweth fiue reasons, why the confession of the truth should be preferred
before all daungers or perills whatsoeuer. 1. There are great promises, which are made to
such as confesse Christ here: he will confesse them before his father in heauen, Matth. 10. 32.
2. <hi>Debitum animi grati,</hi> the debt of a thankefull minde requireth this at our hands, that
we should freely confesse the name of God, of whome we receiue so many benefits in token
of our thankfulnes. 3. The great daungers must be considered, which men by not confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of Christ, doe cast themselues into: they doe hazard their owne soules, Mark. 8. 35. <hi>He

shall denie Christ in earth, Matth. 10. 33. 4. The vtilitie of our brethren, and generall good
of the Church, which is edified and builded vp by such examples of constancie, ought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
vs. 5. And the singular examples of so many holy Martyrs and confessors of the
truth, should embolden vs. The Iewes when <hi>Petronius</hi> attempted to bring in <hi>Cesars</hi> image
into the Church, rather offered themselues to die, then to suffer it, <hi>Ioseph. lib. 18. c. 10, 11.
Polycarpus</hi> when the Romane gouernour would haue compelled him to sweare by Cesars
fortune, openly withstood him, <hi>Euseb. lib. 4. c.</hi> 15. And a noble man of <hi>Nicomedia</hi> pulled
downe and rent in pieces the Emperours edict set vp against the Christians. <hi>Euseb. l. 8. c.</hi> 5.</p>
                        <p>5. Here I can not omit that distinction of <hi>Calvine,</hi> of confession, that it is of two sorts,

that we giue not any peruerse signe of dissimulation: and this must be perpetually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued:

and behauiour he doth shew it.</p>

toward an image.</head>
                        <p>Because Daniel praied looking toward Ierusalem, the Romanists may inferre, that it is as
lawfull to looke toward an image, when they worship God: for, as they alleadge, they doe
not worship the image, but God represented by the image.</p>
                        <p>1. To pray toward Ierusalem was a ceremoniall dutie for those times: they looked that
way toward the Temple, which was a type of Christ: as they looked toward the type and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
so we must turne our eyes toward the bodie, that is, looke vp into heauen where Christ
is. 2. They had a commandement to pray toward the Temple, and had a promise to be
heard: but to worship God before an image is forbidden, and accursed, Deut. 27. 15. 3.
We are not onely forbidden in Scripture to worship any strange god, which is prohibited in
the first commandement; but likewise it is vnlawfull to worship him in any other manner,

                        <p>As they offend which looke toward an image, when they worship God: so likewise they
that turne themselues with adoration toward the bread in the Eucharist, supposing there to
be the bodily presence of Christ. In both these the Romanists are offenders. 1. Indeede if
the humanitie of Christ were corporally present, as they imagine, adoration were to be yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vnto it: As the Apostle saith, <hi>when he bringeth in his first begotten sonne into the world,</hi>
he saith, <hi>and let all the Angels of God worship him:</hi> wheresoeuer Christ is present in his huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
he is there to be worshipped. 2. Therefore the Vbiquitaries and Lutherans, which
hold an omnipresence of Christs flesh, and so affirme the same to be present in the Eucharist,
and yet will not haue it adored in the Sacramentall bread, cannot iustifie with any shewe of
reason this their assertion: for wheresoeuer Christ is, he is there to be adored and worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped:

as soone as he knewe Christ to be him, whom he felt, he presently worshipped, saying, <hi>my

be present, to they both are in errour to maintaine a carnall presence, the one with adoration,
the other without, which is a fansie of their owne: for the Scripture onely commendeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

                        <p>2. But if it be translated, <hi>quia,</hi> because, it is not alwayes taken as a causall, but as an <hi>illa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue</hi>

the greatnesse of his sinne was not the cause of forgiuenesse: this <hi>coniunction</hi> therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies

v. 13. <hi>there was no hurt found vpon him, because he beleeued in his God.</hi> And so the Apostle
testifieth, Heb. 11. that Daniel by faith stopped the mouthes of lyons, <hi>&amp; ex hac vera fide
sequitur innocentia vitae,</hi> and out of this faith proceeded his innocencie as a fruite thereof,
<hi>Osiand,</hi> for otherwise without his faith, though this cause had beene neuer so good, it should
not haue beene accepted.</p>
                        <p>5. Here also we must distinguish betweene eternall deliuerance, and temporall: God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuereth
vs from euerlasting death, not for any respect of any righteousnesse in vs, but freely
of his owne grace he respecteth vs in Christ: but in particular deliuerances, <hi>Deus potest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicere
vniuscuiusque iustitiam,</hi> God may respect euerie ones righteousnes, not as it is theirs,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:18834:101"/>
but as it is wrought in the by his spirit, <hi>Cal.</hi> So then as <hi>Melancthon</hi> saith, here are three things
to be considered, saith whereby we are acceptable vnto God: and so it is said here, that Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel
beleeued in his God: <hi>inchoata obedientia,</hi> our inchoate obedience, which is accepted with
God, because we are iustified by faith: &amp; our righteousnes, whereby we are iust before men:
both these are also here expressed in Daniel, <hi>my iustice was found out before God, and vnto thee
O king haue I done no hurt:</hi> To conclude then this point, a mans particular iustice &amp; innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
is rather an <hi>antecedent</hi> of his deliuerance then a cause. And in some sort it may be said to
be a cause also, yet not of it selfe, but as it concurreth with faith, for the which the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specteth
vs, and our obedience, though imperfect in Christ, <hi>Iun. in comment.</hi>

describeth faith, Heb. 11. 6. <hi>He that commeth vnto God, must beleeue that God is, and

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Chapter containeth, 1. a vision of foure beasts rising out of the Sea:
2. the interpretation thereof.</p>
                     <p>1. In the vision, 1. are set forth certaine circumstances, of the time,
when, the person, to whome this vision was shewed, and the manner how,
v. 1, 2. 2. the matter of the vision, which is, 1. of the foure beasts, of their
flourishing and prosperous estate, to v. 9. then of the iudgement of God
against them, v. 15.</p>
                     <p>The beasts are described, 1. in generall, v. 3. by the efficient cause, the winds blew; by the
number, they are foure; by the place, they came out of the Sea; by their qualitie, they were
one diuers from an other.</p>
                     <p>2. In particular. 1. the three beasts are briefly set forth, v. 4, 5, 6. which are euery one
expressed, 1. by their similitude or resemblance, by their parts, and by their euents. 2. the
fourth beast is described in generall, by the qualitie, it was fearefull and strong, the parts, it
had yron teeth, and tenne hornes, and by the effects, <hi>it deuoured, &amp;c.</hi> then the little horne is
particularly set forth. 1. by the qualitie of it and the place, it was a little one, and came vp
among the other hornes. 2. by the effects, it pluckt away three other hornes. 3. by the
parts, the eyes and mouth.</p>
                     <p>2. The second part of the vision is of the iudgement. 1. the manner and forme, see the
parts thereof, quest. 30. following. 2. the effects, which are two, 1. in the destruction of
the fourth beast, v. 11. and of the other with it, v. 12. 2. in setting vp the kingdome of
Christ, where 1. his person is described, 1. by his name, <hi>the Sonne of man.</hi> 2. by the place, <hi>in
the cloudes.</hi> 3. by his authoritie, he approched to the Ancient of daies. 2. his kingdome
is described by the vniuersalitie of it, <hi>all nations shall serue him:</hi> and the eternitie, <hi>it shall be
for euer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. The interpretation followeth. 1. the manner first is shewed how he came by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of it, v. 15, 16. <hi>An Angel declared it.</hi> 2. then the interpretation it selfe is set
downe. 1. of the beasts. 2. of the iudgement. The beasts are expounded in generall, v. 17.
then in particular, the fourth beast: where is first a repetition of the vision, v. 19. to 23. then
the declaration, 1. of the fourth beast, v. 23. 2. of the tenne hornes, v. 24. 3. of the little
home, what it shall doe, it shall rage against kings, against God, against his people: and
how long, v. 25.</p>
                     <p>Then the iudgement is set forth by the two effects thereof, the destruction of all other
kingdomes, and the aduancing of the kingdome of Christ, v. 26, 27.</p>
                     <p>The conclusion followeth, which sheweth the effect of this vision in Daniel by these
three operations. 1. his perplexed cogitations. 2. the change of his countenance. 3. his
deepe meditation, <hi>I kept it in mine heart.</hi>

of the first hornes were pluckt away before it, and behold eyes as the eyes of a man, <hi>were</hi> in

was set, and the bookes opened.</p>

season (<hi>a time and time.</hi> L. <hi>A. but there are two diuers words vsed in the originall.</hi>)</p>
                     <p>13 I beheld in the visions of the night, and behold with the (<hi>in the. V. B. G. but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position

                     <p>14 And dominion was giuen him, <hi>I. V. S. (he gaue him dominion.</hi> L. <hi>B. G. but the verbe is

                     <p>15 My spirit was troubled (<hi>pierced. C.) yea</hi> I Daniel in the middes of my bodie, <hi>V. (I
Daniel was troubled in spirit in the middes. B. G.</hi> L.) and the visions of my head made me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid:</p>
                     <p>16 I came <hi>then</hi> vnto one of the standers by, and asked him the truth of all this: so he
told me, and shewed me (<hi>made me to vnderstand. C.</hi>) the interpretation of these things.</p>
                     <p>17 These great beasts, which are foure, <hi>are</hi> foure kings (<hi>not kingdomes,</hi> L. <hi>S. yet that is
the meaning</hi>) which shall arise out of the earth.</p>
                     <p>18 And they shall take the kingdome of the most high Saints (not <hi>the most high Saints

the most high.</hi> L. <hi>B. G. for the word</hi> (high) <hi>is in the originall in the plurall number</hi>) and they,

19 After this I desired (or <hi>wished, I.</hi>) to know the truth concerning the fourth beast which
was so diuers from (<hi>vnlike to, B. G.</hi>) all these, exceeding fearefull, whose teeth were of yron,
and his nayles of brasse: he deuoured, and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue vnder his
feete.</p>
                     <p>20 Also concerning the tenne hornes, which <hi>were</hi> in his head, and of the last, <hi>Iun. (the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
caeter. see before,</hi> v. 8.) which came vp, and three hornes fell before it: of this horne (<hi>I say</hi>)
which had eyes, and a mouth speaking presumptuous things, whose looke was more stout
(<hi>great, C.</hi>) then his fellowes.</p>
                     <p>21 I beheld, and the same horne made battell with (<hi>against, L. B. G.</hi>) the Saints, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed
against them.</p>
                     <p>22 Vntill the Auncient of daies came, and iudgement was giuen vnto the most high
Saints: (<hi>Saints of the most high, L. S. see before,</hi> v. 18.) and the time approched, that the Saints
possessed the kingdome.</p>
                     <p>23 Thus <hi>also</hi> he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdome in the earth, which
shall be diuers from (<hi>vnlike to. B. G. greater then. L. S.</hi>) all the kingdomes, and shall deuoure
the whole earth, and shall tread it downe, and breake it in pieces.</p>
                     <p>24 And tenne hornes out of this kingdome (<hi>that is,</hi> tenne kings shall arise: and the last
(<hi>I. Br. an other. L. S. V. see before,</hi> v. 8.) shall rise vp after them, and he shall be diuers from
the former (<hi>not greater. L. or shall ouer come all the euill, that were before him. S.</hi>) and he shall
subdue three kings,</p>
                     <p>25 And he shall speake words against the most high (better <hi>then on the side, or behalfe of
the most high. A. or of diuine things. V. the word (letzad) here signifieth against</hi>) and shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume

                     <p>26 But the iudgement shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, in consuming and

                     <p>27 And the kingdome and dominion, and the greatnes of the kingdomes (not <hi>kingdome,

                        <p>This vision contained in this chapter, beeing shewed vnto Daniel in the first yeare of Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thazar,
who was the last king of the Chaldeans, and before Darius, vnder whome that mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
fell out, in Daniels deliuerance from the lyons, c. 6. is a manifest argument that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
storie is transposed; this vision in time comming before it, yet in order beeing placed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it: the reasons hereof are these. 1. <hi>Theodoret</hi> saith, that in the former sixe chapters, <hi>hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storico
more prophetiam conscripsit,</hi> he writ the prophecie after an historicall manner, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what things happened vnder Nebuchadnezzer, Balthazar, Darius; but in the sixe chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
following, he setteth downe those predictions, <hi>quas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> per diuinam reuelationem do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus
est,</hi> which he was taught by diuine reuelation. 2. <hi>Hierome</hi> doth adde further, that
in the former chapters Daniel historically setteth downe, <hi>quid mirabilium signorum ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciderit,
&amp;c.</hi> what memorable signes happened vnder these kings; but in the rest of this
booke he declareth such visions, <hi>quarum solus propheta conscius est,</hi> which the Prophet
onely was priuie vnto himselfe. 3. <hi>Hugo</hi> giueth this reason: the things before histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
rehearsed, <hi>tempore suo impleta sunt,</hi> were such as were fulfilled in Daniels time;
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:18834:106"/>
but these here following were <hi>visiones futurorum,</hi> visions of things to come to passe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward.
4. Further, in the former histories God had appointed Daniel, <hi>interpretem &amp;
magistrum profanis regibus,</hi> an interpreter and teacher vnto the profane kings: <hi>nunc praefecit
Ecclesiae doctorem,</hi> now he set him vp as an instructer of his Church, <hi>Calvin.</hi> 5. The former
histories and miracles shewed the calling of Daniel, and the confirmation thereof by signes
and miracles: in these chapters Daniel exerciseth his vocation and function, in his propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
visions, <hi>Iun. 6. Lyranus</hi> beside the reason before touched, that the former visions were
partly historicall, partly propheticall, and therefore were set downe together, but these visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are <hi>mere propheticae,</hi> merely propheticall; assigneth also this reason, that the former visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
belong vnto the first comming of Christ, and therefore are set together: these following
concerne his second comming: but this is not so, for c. 9. there is a manifest prophecie of the
first comming of the Messiah, and the very time is described: and though mention be made
by the way (as it were) of the resurrection, and the finall iudgement, c. 12. yet the visions are
principally intended to foretell such things, as should befall the Church of the Iewes before
the first comming of the Messiah.</p>

                        <p>1. <hi>Hierome</hi> by these fowre windes vnderstandeth the good Angels, who are compared
to the windes in three respects. 1. for their celeritie. 2. because they are invisible. 3.
and are knowne onely of vs by their effects, as the windes are: and these good Angels doe
striue for the good of those seuerall countries, ouer the which they are set: as the Angel
which was president of Chaldea, laboured that the Iewes might remaine still in captiuitie for
the instruction of the Chaldeans: the Angel of the Hebrewes, endeauoured that they might
be deliuered: But, neither haue the good Angels such speciall regiments assigned vnto them,
neither are their endeauours contrarie each vnto other, neither doe any of them labour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the people of God, but they doe all minister for the elects sake.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> (so also <hi>Hugo, Lyranus,</hi>) vnderstandeth here the euill Angels,
which are said to fight and striue, because they stirre vp men to strife and contention: but
these are called the windes or spirits of heauen, which title is not giuen vnto euill Angels.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Pererius</hi> by these fowre principall windes which doe blowe from the 4. corners of

followe vpon the rising of these beasts, as procured by them: these windes goe before,

but these beasts were the causes of these afflictions: the windes goe before, and are the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of their comming forth.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi>Calvin</hi> thinketh that Daniel, <hi>similitudinem notam ominibus assumit,</hi> both take a simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
well knowne vnto all: for the windes doe not blowe so much vpon the solid earth, as
vpon the liquid Sea: by this similitude he sheweth that the world shall be like a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
Sea.</p>
                        <p>7. <hi>Iunius</hi> thinketh that mention is made of the windes, <hi>quia Deus solitus est seruos su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the windes before, when they receiue any visions as Elias was so prepared, 1. King. 19.</p>
                        <p>8. But beside these allusions, specially by these words is expressed the ministrie of the
Angels, who are compared to windes, Psal. 104. 4. <hi>which maketh the spirits or windes his
messengers,</hi> so Reuel. 7. 1. the fowre Angels are said to hold the fowre windes of the earth,
that they should not blowe: not that particular countries are assigned to the custodie of
Angels; which conceite is refuted before: but hereby is signified, that the Angels are like
the windes dispersed euerie where in the world, as ministers of Gods will, <hi>Iun. Polan.</hi>

them.</p>

they ascend, by degrees these terrene Monarchies attained to their power and strength. 4.

beasts.</head>
                        <p>1. In that kings are resembled vnto beasts, it is not spoken in disgrace of the honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
calling of Magistrates, which is the ordinance of God: and in these Monarchies there
were some good Princes, as <hi>Cyrus, Artaxerxes,</hi> which fauoured the people of God: 2. But
because many of those great kings were Tyrants, and oppressed the people of God, they
are tearmed beasts: as <hi>Hierome</hi> saith, <hi>regnorum feritas bestiarum nomine demonstratur,</hi> the
crueltie of those kingdomes is shewed by the name of beasts. 3. So that which is essentiall
in the calling of princes, namely, the institution and ordinance of God, is not here signified,
but that which is accidentall in them, the abuse of their gouernement, which proceedeth not
from the institutor, or institution, but from themselues, <hi>Calvin. Polan.</hi>

                        <p>1. As there the king sawe a great image, so here the Prophet nameth a great Sea. 2. here
fowre beasts came vp, and there the image is compounded of fowre mettalls, gold, siluer,
brasse, and yron, which represent the fowre great Monarchies and kingdomes. 3. as there
the yron and clay feete had their toes, which in number are tenne, so the last beast here hath

                        <p>For their prosperous state, they are compared vnto the lyon and the eagle. 1. The vulgar
Latine readeth a <hi>lionesse,</hi> whereupon <hi>Hierome</hi> noteth two properties in the Chaldean Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie,
<hi>ingentem ferociam &amp; libidinem,</hi> their fiercenes and intemperate lust: for the lionesse
is more fierce then the lyon, and verie insatiable and intemperate, not onely coupling with
the Lyon, but with the <hi>Hyena,</hi> and the <hi>Pardus,</hi> whereof commeth that mixt kind of the
Leopard: but the word here vsed, <hi>arieh,</hi> signifieth a lyon, not a lionesse: therefore that note
hath no ground, which the <hi>ordinar. gloss.</hi> borroweth out of <hi>Hierome,</hi> that for crueltie this
Monarchie is compared to a lyonesse, rather then to a lyon.</p>
                        <p>2. There are diuers names giuen vnto lions according to their age, <hi>ghur,</hi> is a lyons whelpe,
<hi>chephir,</hi> a young lyon, <hi>ghur shacal,</hi> a middle lyon, <hi>laish,</hi> an olde lyon, <hi>labi,</hi> a decrepite lyon.</p>

3. The Chaldeans are resembled to a lyon, as Theodoret thinketh, because it was

magnanimitie and courage of them, as likewise withall, their crueltie and rage: In the image,
c. 2. the Chaldean state is compared vnto gold, and here to a lyon, which is the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and heroicall beast: thus also the Prophets resemble the Chaldeans to a lyon, Isa. 5.
29. Ierem. 4. v. 7.</p>
                        <p>4. By the Eagles wings is signified the great celeritie and swiftnesse of the Chaldeans
in their conquests and victories: so also doe the other Prophets liken the Chaldeans to a
swift Eagle, Ierem. 48. v. 40. Esech. 17. v. 3. by the two wings, are vnderstood, the Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonian

                        <p>Then followeth a description of their declining estate, in these foure degrees. 1. the
wings are pulled away: their dexteritie and courage is taken from them: t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

themselues to idlenesse and pleasure: likewise the Persians pulled their wings, when they
stripped them at once of all their dignitie and gouernement. 2. then it was reared from the
earth: whereas they did flie aloft before, now it can scarce lift vp the head from the ground:
the <hi>Latine</hi> readeth it was taken from the earth: but the Chaldean state remayned still after
their wings were pulled, it was not vtterly dissolued. 3. then he was set vpon his feete as a
man: they could no longer flie with Eagles wings, but stood vpon the ground as other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie

how his wings were clipped, and his pride abated, when he became as a bruit beast,
depriued of his reason and vnderstanding: and when he was restored to his vnderstanding,
he was as set vpon his feete, and had a mans heart giuen him againe, whereas he had a beasts
heart before till 7. yeares were past: But because this is a description of the whole state and
Monarchie, and <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was at this time dead, the former interpretation is better.</p>

                        <p>1. Some thinke that the Assyrian Monarchie beganne in Nimrod, and so continued as
<hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> thinketh a 1300. yeares, vnto <hi>Sardanapalus:</hi> who was the last king of the

may be made hereunto. 1. although Nimrod were mightie in his time,<note place="margin">Gen. 14. 1. 5.</note> and raigned in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,
yet not long after in Abrahams time, <hi>Chedorlaomer</hi> king of Elam or Persia, was grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                        <p>1. <hi>Lyranus</hi> thinketh they are so resembled, because the beare is lesse cruell: and so the
Persians were more equall toward the people of God: but in this sense, this vision should

it stood vpon one side, which the Hebrewes expound, that this Monachie was not so cruell

and made but one dominion of them all: so also <hi>Polanus:</hi> the word <hi>satar,</hi> with a pricke on
the left side ouer <hi>shin,</hi> signifieth a side, also so <hi>D. Kimchi</hi> readeth: but with a pricke on the
right side, <hi>shatar,</hi> it signifieth rule and dominion: the first reading seemeth to be the fitter,
because of the preposition <hi>lamed,</hi> set before <hi>lishtar, on the side,</hi> which is omitted in the other
reading.</p>
                        <p>7. <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> thus interpreteth, he stood vpon one side, that is, there was a place

                        <p>5. As both these last senses may be receiued, so yet further here may be vnderstood the
instruments whereby the kings of Persia were stirred vp, to destroy and deuoure: as <hi>Darius,</hi>
called also <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> and the <hi>Hyrcanians,</hi> together with <hi>Gobryas</hi> a gouernour of Assyria, did
stirre vp <hi>Cyrus</hi> against the Babylonians, <hi>Xenophon lib. 4. Mardonius</hi> likewise perswaded
<hi>Xerxes</hi> to take in hand the warre against Grecia, but <hi>Artabanus</hi> disswaded him: in which
warre, as <hi>Orosiu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

very swift, as Habak. 1. 8. <hi>Their horses shall be swifter then leopards:</hi> So <hi>Alexander</hi> in a short

3. Hereby rather is signified <hi>Alexanders</hi> great celeritie, which is shadowed forth in
the nature of the beast, but more liuely expressed by wings: &amp; he is said to haue foure wings,
not two, <hi>quia nihil fuit velocius Alexandri victoria,</hi> because nothing was swifter then <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi>
victories, <hi>Hier.</hi> for in 12. yeares he made conquest of all the famous kingdomes of the

                        <p>3. Then this beast is set forth by the number of the heads, <hi>the beast also had foure heads.</hi>
1. <hi>Iunius</hi> hereby would not haue vnderstood foure kingdomes, but the great dexteritie of
<hi>Alexander,</hi> in taking care for all the parts of his kingdome, as if he had had foure heads. <hi>Iun.

<hi>Oecolamp. Perer. Papp. Calv.</hi> with others: but these 4. kingdomes make the fourth beast, as
afterward shall be shewed. 3. Wherefore better are here vnderstood the 4. chiefe captains
of Alexander, which did aide him to atchieue his victories, and afterward gouerned the
kingdome vnder <hi>Aridaeus</hi> Alexanders brother, who beeing slaine, they diuided the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
among them: So <hi>Hugo</hi> saith, <hi>quatuor dicit duces Alexandri,</hi> he meaneth the foure
captaines of Alexander, which afterward became his successors: so <hi>Iunius</hi> in his <hi>annotations</hi>

to make <hi>Aridaeus Alexanders</hi> brother king, and appointed <hi>Antipater,</hi> to be protector
of the kindome: but at length, both <hi>Alexanders</hi> sonnes were slaine by <hi>Cassander,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridaeus</hi>

And the other three in their seuerall kingdomes, as is before expressed.</p>
                        <p>4. The last part of the description is from the efficient cause and author of this great do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
which <hi>Alexander</hi> had, <hi>it was giuen him of God:</hi> and that he obtained not such great
victories by his owne power or policie, but by the extraordinarie assistance of God, doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently
appeare by these fowre arguments. 1. because he in a shorter time subdued more
countries then other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> captaines haue taken cities: as is before shewed in the second
part of the description. 2. in that he with so small an host of 30. thousand, encountred with
such great armies of the Persians, first, with an 150. thousand, then with 400. thousand, and
last of all with 10. hundred thousand, which <hi>Darius Codomannus</hi> had gathered together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him. 3. <hi>Alexanders</hi> securitie is an euident argument also thereof, who the same day
that <hi>Darius</hi> was ouercome, was so fast asleepe in his Tent, that all his captaines could not
awake him, making a noise round about, for they durst not goe in. 4. <hi>Alexander</hi> himselfe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
confessed as much, who meeting Iaddua the high Preist in his pontificall robes, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
downe before him, and reuerencing him, being asked the reason of <hi>Parmenio,</hi> answered,
that he worshipped not the man, but God in the man, who in the same habite had appeared
vnto him, and encouraged him to goe on in his enterprise to ouercome Asia, and promised
to lead his armies: thus <hi>Iosephus</hi> writeth, <hi>lib. 11. Antiquit.</hi> c. 8.</p>

                        <head>Quest. 19. Why the fourth beast hath
no name.</head>
                        <p>1. The Hebrewes doe here imagine that although this fourth beast be not expressed by
name, yet that it was a wild boare, whereby they would haue signified the Romane Empire
which destroyed Ierusalem: and they alleadge that saying in the Psalme, 80. 13. <hi>the wilde
boare out of the wood hath destroyed it:</hi> But seeing this last kingdome is described to be more
fierce and cruell then the rest, it was not like to be resembled by the wild boare, which is not
so terrible, as the other three beasts, the lyon, the beare, the Leopard, vnto the which the
other three kingdomes are compared.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Theodoret</hi> applying this vision to the Romane Empire, thinketh that this is the reason
why certaine beasts are before named, but none here: because in the other three kingdoms,
there was a certaine forme of gouernement by kings; but in the Romane state the forme of
gouernment often changed: they were gouerned 1. by kings, 2. by Consuls. 3. by the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes
of the people. 4. by Dictators. 5. by Emperours. But it shall euidently appeare after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
that this vision is not to be extended to the Romanes.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Hierome</hi> giueth this reason: the beast is not named, <hi>vt si quid ferocius bestijs supradictis
cogitauerimus, hoc imperio Romanorum attribuamus, &amp;c.</hi> that if any thing can be imagined
more cruell, then the forenamed beasts, it should be attributed to the Romane Empire: thus
also <hi>Lyran. gloss. ordinar.</hi> with others: <hi>Hieromes</hi> reason here in generall is to be admitted,
but he faileth likewise in his particular application to the Romane state.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Pererius</hi> hath this conceit, that if this last Monarchie here described, which he suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
to be of the Romanes, should be represented by any certaine kind of beast, it is most
like to be that, which <hi>Aristotle</hi> out of <hi>Ctesias Gnidius,</hi> saith is found in India, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth
in this manner: the name of the beast is <hi>Mantichora,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Aristot. lib. 2. de histor. animal. c. 1.</note> it hath three rowes of teeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
and belowe: with lyons feete, and of bignesse and haire like to a lyon: with mans
eares, a scorpions tayle: it maketh a noise like a trumpet: as swift as an hart: so wilde that it

presumption for vs to gesse at it.</p>
                        <p>5. Wherefore those two reasons may be yeelded, why no certaine beast is here named:
both in respect of this description here made, <hi>propter infinit am, varietatem,</hi> for the great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie

                        <p>It is described 1. by three adiuncts, it was fearefull, terrible, and strong. 2. by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,

                        <head>Quest. 21. Whether the Romane or Turkish Empire
be signified by this fourth
beast.</head>
                        <p>1. The Rabbines by this fourth beast vnderstand the Empire of the Turkes, of which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
are <hi>R. Ab. Ezra,</hi> and <hi>R. Saadiah;</hi> because mention is made afterward of one like
the sonne of man, to whom power and dominion was giuen, which sheweth that the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah
should raigne after this fourth kingdome should be dissolued, whom because they hold
not yet to be come, they would haue this vision vnderstood of the Turkish Empire. And to
make their opinion more probable, they ioyne the Greeke and Romane Empire together,
comprehending them both vnder the third beast: And <hi>Ab. Ezra,</hi> doubteth not to call A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander
king of the Romanes. So by this deuise they would prooue Christ Iesus not to be
the Messiah, because he was borne vnder the third Empire.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. Herein the Rabbines shew their great ignorance in confounding the Greeke
and Romane Empire: vnlesse it be because Constantinople was called newe Rome, and they
finde that one of the Romane Emperours was called <hi>Alexander,</hi> which are slender reasons
to confound the two Empires. 2. neither was <hi>Alexander</hi> knowne vnto the Romanes, who
yet at time were of great power, and mightier then diuerse kings. 3. this vision cannot be
applyed vnto the Empire of the Turkes: for it cannot be shewed, how he hath 10. hornes,
that is, so many kings, nor what that little horne should be, before the which three other
were pluckt away.</p>
                        <p>2. Some doe apply this vision to the Romane Empire alone, and that but vnto the first
comming of Christ, as <hi>Calvin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. Some doe vnderstand the Romane Empire, that it shall continue to the ende of the
world: as <hi>Hierome</hi> saith, that toward the ende of the world when the Romane Empire shall
be destroyed, there shall rise tenne kings, which shall deuide the Empire among them: But
neither of these opinions can stand: for whereas these kingdomes are described by the simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
of beasts, whose crueltie they should imitate toward the people of God; before the
first comming of Christ the Romanes had not practised such crueltie against the Iewes, as
that therein they should haue beene vnlike to all which went before them: neither yet is
the Romane Empire to continue vnto the ende of the world, which was long since dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Pappus</hi> thinketh that both the Turkish tyranie, and the proud iurisdiction of the
Popes of Rome, are described vnder this last beast, shewing how all the properties of the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
horne agree vnto them both, in their small beginnings, their subtiltie and hypocrisie, their
blasphemie against Christ and his gospel: Neither neede it seeme strange saith he, that two
diuerse gouernements are signified by one horne, because they both propound vnto them
the same ende and scope, the subuersion of the Church, and vse the same weapons in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
crueltie, and blasphemie.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. This fourth kingdome shall be destroyed by the comming of the Messiah
in the flesh, as was prophesied before in the vision of the image, c. 2. 44. and here also, v.
13. <hi>one like the sonne of man came in the clouds,</hi> which is to be vnderstood not of his second
commming to iudgement, but of his first comming to finish the worke of our redemption,
as shall be shewed more at large, when we come to that place: now neither Turke nor Pope
were then head of the world, when the Sonne of man came in the flesh, nor diuerse hundred
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:18834:111"/>
yeares after. 2. this fourth beast should be more cruell, then any of the rest toward the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God then, for whose comfort this vision was reuealed to Daniel: but the Romanes
before the comming of Christ had beene more equall toward the Iewes, then any of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Monarchies. 3. this horne came forth of the fourth beast: the beast signifieth but one
Monarch or kingdome, as the other three before: therefore two kingdomes, and the same
opposite the one to the other, cannot be comprehended vnder one horne: other reasons why
the Romane Monarchie is not understood neither in this, nor that other vision tending to the
same ende, c. 2. see at large, c. 2. quest. 49.</p>
                        <p>5. Seeing then that the Romane Empire is here excluded, all that labour may be spared
which <hi>Pererius</hi> taketh to shew wherein the Romane power consisted, by what meanes they
attained vnto their large dominion, and whether iustly or vniustly, as impertinent to this
place: yet it shall not be amisse, to take a short viewe of that, which is set downe by him
touching these three questions. 1. Their greatnesse consisted, first in the largenesse of their
dominion,<note place="margin">Wherein the Romane pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er chiefely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted.</note> which extended Westward to Spaine, Southward to Ethiopia, and Eastward to
Armenia: in so much that <hi>Appian</hi> affirmeth, that the other three Monarchies had not the half
part, of the Romane Empire. Secondly, in their prouision for warre: the Romanes had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
in a readines 200. thousand footemen, 40. thousand horsemen, 300. Elephants for
warre, 3000. chariots, amour in store for 300. thousand, 2000. shippes, 1500. gallies,
80. great shippes: this strength they were of vnder Adrian the Emperour, as <hi>Appian</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth.
Thirdly, their strength consisted in their riches and treasure: they had of treasure in a
readinesse in diuerse places, 75. thousand Egyptian talents: a talent of Egypt weighed 80<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>.
which is equiualent to 8000. Italian peices of gold: the whole summe will amount to 600
times tenne hundred thousand, that is, 600 millions of gold. 2. Touching the means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they enlarged their Empire, they were these. 1. the loue of libertie. 2. their ambitious
desire to rule. 3. their affecting of praise and renowne. 4. their militarie discipline. 5. their
curtesie to their friends, and seueritie against their enemies. 3. Some part of their kingdome
they got vniustly, as <hi>Pompey</hi> tooke Asia from the rightfull kings: <hi>Cyprus</hi> they tooke from
<hi>Ptolome, Sardinia</hi> from <hi>Carthage.</hi> Some countries were giuen and bequeathed vnto them,
as Asia by <hi>Attalus</hi> will, <hi>Bythinia</hi> by <hi>Nicodemus</hi> testament: the <hi>Cyrenians,</hi> and <hi>Pentapolis</hi> by
<hi>Ptolome, Lybia</hi> by king <hi>Appio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>, Perer.</hi> But all this discourse here is superfluous, seeing in
this place we haue nothing to doe with the Romanes, but as it is typically shadowed forth
in the kingdome of the <hi>Seleucians.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>6. It remaineth then that this fourth beast must represent the kingdome of Syria, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
tenne kings succeeded one another, the last of which was <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> who is
the little horne here spoken of: That this interpretation is most probable, shall appeare in
the handling of the seuerall parts of this vision: neither is it new, taken vp by <hi>Iunius</hi> onely,
<hi>Polanus,</hi> and others; but <hi>Hierome</hi> maketh mention of one <hi>Polichronius,</hi> who so vnderstood
it and <hi>Theodoret</hi> also sheweth the same to haue beene the opinion of some, though he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue
vpon the Romanes: And yet we denie not but that typically also vnder the kingdome
of the Seleucians, is shadowed forth the Monarchie of the Romans, as S. Iohn in the descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the beast with seuen heads and tenne hornes, hath relation vnto this vision, thereby
implying the Romane Monarchie, Apocal. 13. 1.</p>

                        <head>Quest. 26. Of the tenne hornes, what is signified
thereby, v. 7.</head>
                        <p>The diuerse opinions which are held concerning the interpretation of these words, are of
two sorts, some by <hi>tenne</hi> vnderstand not precisely a certaine number, but an vncertaine and
indefinite, they take tenne for many, as Num. 14. 22. <hi>they haue tempted me tenne times,</hi> Iob.
19. 2. <hi>yee haue tenne times reproached me.</hi> Some vnderstand according to the litterall sense,
so many kings precisely.</p>
                        <p>1. Of the first sort. 1. Some by tenne kings vnderstand all the kings which should be in
the Romne Empire, from the beginning to the ende thereof, vnto the comming of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ;
<hi>numero isto denario vniuersitas Regum significata est, &amp;c.</hi> by this number of tenne is
signified the vniuersall companie of the kings in the Romane Empire, <hi>August, lib. 20. de
ciuit. Dei. c.</hi> 23. 2. Some by these kings vnderstand the seuerall prouinces and kingdomes
which were gouerned by Proconsuls and deputies, the Romane Empire yet standing, <hi>Calv.</hi> 2. Some the kingdomes into the which the Romane Empire was diuided and dissolued: as
first it was parted into the East and West Empire: in the East sprang vp the kingdomes of
the <hi>Persians, Saracenes,</hi> and of other nations: in the West, of the <hi>Gothes, Lombards, Hunnes,
Bulling.</hi> so also <hi>Pintus, Sa, Oecolamp. Perer.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But all these are deceiued. 1. in taking this number of tenne for a number indefinite: for
seeing this number is diuided, as after mention is made of three kings, which shall be pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
away, a certaine and finite number must be signified: and if tenne did not betoken a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
number, the time should not be known, when the little horne, the last of the ten, should
be expected. 2. The kings doe not signifie kingdomes, but so many kings out of one king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
as it is expounded, v. 24. <hi>the tenne hornes out of this kingdome, are tenne kings that
shall rise:</hi> they must rise out of one kingdome. 3. neither can these tenne kingdomes, which
they vnderstand, be raised after the dissolution of the Empire; for the beast is not destroyed,
that is the kingdome dissolued vntill the little horne came vp, v. 11.</p>
                        <p>2. Of the second sort also there are diuerse opinions. 1. Some by tenne hornes vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
so many kings, which in the end of the world shall diuide the Romane Empire among
them, and then shall the eleuenth horne rise vp, which they suppose to be Antichrist: of this
opinion is <hi>Hierome,</hi> whom <hi>Lyranus</hi> followeth, <hi>Hugo, gloss. ordinar. &amp; interlin.</hi> But, as <hi>Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colamp.</hi>
noteth, we finde this to be otherwise: for one part of the Romane Empire onely
which is in Europe, we see to be diuided into tenne kingdomes: as <hi>Portugall, Spaine, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Fraunce, Denmarke, Suecia, Polonia, Bohemia, Hungaria, Naples:</hi> the other parts of
the Empire were deuided into more kingdomes.</p>
                        <p>2. Some vnderstand the 10. Prouinces, which were subiect to the Romane Emperour,
gouerned by Consuls: as <hi>Strabo lib.</hi> 17. reckoneth tenne of them: But the Proconsuls and
Deputies were not kings: and though they were as kings, they had their seueral prouinces as
their kingdomes, but these kings must come out of one kingdome.</p>
                        <p>3. Some doe here number tenne seuerall kingdomes, into the which the Romane Empire
was diuided: as some doe reckon these: <hi>Italie, Spaine, Fraunce, Germanie, Illyricum, Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,
Africa, Egypt, Asia, Syria, Melancthon.</hi> Some doe for <hi>Illyricum,</hi> put <hi>England,</hi> numbring
the rest which are before rehearsed, <hi>Osiand.</hi> Some doe name the tenne kingdomes in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope
before specified, <hi>ex Pap.</hi> But it is euident, that more then ten kingdomes are risen out
of the Romane Empire, seeing so many are found onely in Europe.</p>
                        <p>4. Some then leauing this conceit of the Romane Empire, doe finde these tenne
hornes, that is so many kings in diuerse kingdomes, putting together <hi>Macedonia,
Egypt, Syria:</hi> this was the opinion of <hi>Porphyrie</hi> rehearsed and refuted by <hi>Hierome:</hi>
                           <pb n="215" facs="tcp:18834:113"/>
for these kings must rise out of the same kingdome, as these tenne hornes came out of one
and the same beast.</p>
                        <p>5. Wherefore these tenne hornes, were indeede tenne kings of Syria, which the Seleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

beeing but a child, and not able to gouerne the kingdome, after he had raigned two yeares,
was poisoined: But I rather followe <hi>Iunius</hi> for these reasons. 1. seeing <hi>Polanus</hi> confesseth
that <hi>Euergetes</hi> expelled <hi>Callinicus,</hi> and held the kingdome, he is as well to be counted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
these tenne kings, as afterward <hi>Ptolome Philopator,</hi> who inuaded the kingdome vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Antiochus</hi> the great. 2. <hi>Seleucus Ceraunus</hi> raigned himselfe but three yeares, and next
vnto him succeeded <hi>Antiochus</hi> the great: no mention is made in some Chronicles of <hi>Cerau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>7. But against this interpretation of the tenne kings of Syria, thus it will be obiected. 1.
<hi>Lyranus</hi> saith that these kings must not be vnderstood <hi>per successionem vnius post alterum,</hi> by
the succession of one after another, but they were all at one time, as the Angell expoundeth

                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. The contrarie appeareth by the Angels exposition, that these kings shall one

that shall rise:</hi> now in one kingdome there cannot be tenne kings at once, euerie king hath
his kingdome: 2. as the three kings which shall be subdued, are vnderstood successiuely, so
are the tenne: but these followed one an other by succession: as <hi>Andreas</hi> whose opinion
<hi>Hugo</hi> reporteth, thus expoundeth, <hi>alios duos sibi succedentes similiter occidet,</hi> he shal likewise
kill two other kings succeeding one another.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Pererius</hi> obiecteth that in the Syrian kingdome, there were but eight kings in all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Antiochus Epiphanes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> There were but eight of that line: but two kings of Egypt, <hi>Ptolome Euergetes, &amp;
Ptolome Philopator,</hi> which held the kingdom by conquest, are to be numbred among them.</p>
                        <p>3. This fourth kingdome shall be more fierce and mightier, then any before it: but the
kingdome of <hi>Syria</hi> was not mightier then <hi>Alexanders, Perer.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>

they carried a more strong and terrible hand ouer, then did Alexander who fauoured them.</p>
                        <p>4. It may be obiected, that this fourth beast shall deuoure the whole earth, and shall
tread it downe, and breake it in peices, v. 23. but the kingdome of Syria did not subdue
the whole earth.</p>

                           </gap>rours before named. 2. for their doctrine, they abolish the writings of the Prophets,
and Apostles, they denie Christ to be the Sauiour of the world, and many horrible blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
doe they vtter against the Son of God. 3. their power exceedeth all other Monarchies:
they haue vnder their Empire the most part of Africa, and a great part of Europe, and Asia.
4. For their place, they came from the North, from the mount <hi>Caucasus,</hi> as Ezekiel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesieth
that Gog and Magog shall come from the North, Ezeck. 39. 2.</p>
                        <p>But <hi>Pererius</hi> sheweth by these two arguments, that the Turke is not here meant to be this
little horne. 1. because when Mahomet did rise, there were not tenne kings in the Romane
Empire, it was not yet dissolued and deuided into tenne kingdomes, but remayned whole
vnder the obedience of the Emperor. 2. This horne shall afflict the people of God a time,
two times, and an halfe, that is three yeares and an halfe: but Mahomet and his followers,
haue persecuted the Church of God many hundred yeares. 3. <hi>Burgensis</hi> addeth further this
reason: that the Turke doth not make the fourth beast, which is the fourth Monarchie here
described, nor that set forth in the Image, <hi>c.</hi> 2. because before the first comming of Christ,
which is there spoken of, there was no mention at all of the Turkes and Saracenes: and the
fowre Monarchies were absolute in their times, that no other kingdome was able to resist
them: So is not the Turke, for he is encountred with other enemies equivalent vnto him:
4. But this further may disprooue this opinion for the Turkes: this fourth kingdome shall
make warre with the Saints and the people of God, which then were vnderstood to be the
Iewes, the knowne, people of God: But the Turkes are at this day great friends vnto the
Iewes, of whom they borrowe the greater part of their religion. This little horne then vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the reasons aforesaid, is not the great Turke, to whome by way of analogie many of the
properties of this horne may agree, but historically it is not meant of him.</p>
                        <p>2. Of the second sort that here vnderstand the Romane Empire, is <hi>R. Leui,</hi> who some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
maketh the next after the tenth <hi>Caesar,</hi> which was <hi>Traiane,</hi> to be this horne, sometime
<hi>Constantine:</hi> But both of these were commendable Emperours: <hi>Traiane</hi> is renowned euen
among the Gentiles, and <hi>Constantine</hi> was a vertuous and religious Emperour, as all our hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories
doe write of him.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Calvin</hi> would haue this little horne to be <hi>Iulius Caesar, Augustus,</hi> and the other which
succeeded him: But seeing that the tenne hornes are expounded to be tenne kings, the little
horne beeing the last of the tenne, cannot be the first, nor the second, or the rest in order:
<hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> was the first Emperour, next to him was <hi>Augustus,</hi> and so the rest that follow.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> doth indifferently vnderstand this little horne to be both the Pope in
the West, and the Turke in the East; which he expoundeth to be the beast with two hornes,
Apocal. 13. 11. the one pushing in Europe by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Africa, by tyrannie and violence, so also <hi>Pap.</hi> But v. 24. the Angel expoundeth the tenne
hornes to be tenne kings of one kingdome: the Pope and Turke make not one kingdome,
therefore they cannot both be this horne.</p>

5. Some apply this prophesie vnto Antichrist, whom they suppose shall come in the end
of the world after the Romane Empire is destroyed, and deuided among tenne kings: <hi>Hier.
Lyran. Hugo.</hi> who out of <hi>Andr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him, and reedifie the Temple at Ierusalem: But this is an olde dreame, that such an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
shall come toward the ende of the world: this phansie is receiued both of Turkes, who
in their Alcaron speake of Antichrist that shall come, whom Christ shall destroy, and the
Papists expect the like Antichrist to come, three yeare and an halfe before the second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of Christ: Both of them are grossely deceiued: for the little horne here described,
should make warre with the Saints, that then were the Iewes, whose commonwealth long
since was dissolued, and they through the world dispersed.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi>Bullinger</hi> vnderstandeth this little horne to be the Pope, shewing, how from small
beginnings that Sea did growe vp at the first, as a little horne, partly by the graunt of the
Emperours, as <hi>Boniface</hi> the 3. obtained of the Emperour <hi>Phocas</hi> to be called the Vniuersall
Bishop, partly by their pride and ambition: But still this principle must be held, that Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
describeth here by this horne, a great enemie and persecutor of the Iewish nation, the
people of God then: therefore this vision, although analogically it may be referred to the
Pope the verie Antichrist, of whom <hi>Antiochus Epiphan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

yet literally and historically it is not so intended.</p>
                        <p>7. But the Hebrewes of all other are the most malicious and absurd, who most blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
make <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> our Blessed Lord and Sauiour, this little horne: for so they say, his
beginning was small and base, he came out of the fourth beast, he ioyned with the Romane
Empire as appeared in <hi>Constantine:</hi> he spake presumptuous things, in making himselfe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
vnto God, and changed times, in abrogating the ceremonies of Moses lawe, <hi>ex Paul.
Burgensi.</hi> But all this is malitiously and ignorantly deuised of the Iewes. 1. because this
horne is little at the first, it followeth not, that whosoeuer is little and smal at the first, should
be this horne. 2. neither is the Romane Empire this fourth beast: and though the Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
authoritie did set forth and maintaine the gospel of Christ, there is great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
terrene dominion, and the spirituall kingdome of Christ. 3. out Blessed Sauiour
was equall to his father as God, and as the true Messiah was to determine and abolish the
legall ceremonies: The Iewes therefore thus obiecting, doe but bewray their own ignorance,
concerning the true Messiah.</p>
                        <p>8. It remaineth then, that this little horne was historically <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> who

horne, as shall be shewed in the questions next ensuing: Thus <hi>Polychronius</hi> interpreted
this place, whose opinion <hi>Hierome</hi> misliketh: <hi>lunius</hi> thus expoundeth, and <hi>Polanus</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing

                        <p>Some doe take this number of three indefinitely for no certaine number, some do strictly
vnderstand three as they are named: and each of these opinions hath diuerse varieties and
differences.</p>
                        <p>1. They which take it indefinitely. 1. Some by three kings vnderstand many, <hi>R. Leui</hi> of
many kings subdued by the Romane Empire, <hi>R. Saadia</hi> of the Turkish dominion, <hi>Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lampadius</hi>
of both: and the wearing of the Popes triple crowne signifieth his dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
three, that is, diuerse kings: But where diuerse numbers are named, and there is a diuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of number: as here of tenne and three; there certaine numbers are vnderstood: otherwise
if the number of ten should be taken indefinitely, and so the number of three; more should
not be signified by tenne, then by three, no certaine number beeing contained in either.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Calvin</hi> giueth this exposition: This litttle horne tooke away three hornes, that is, a
great part of the regall power and authoritie; which he thinketh was done, when <hi>Augustus
Caesar</hi> tooke from the Senate the authoritie of naming Proconsuls and Gouernours for the
Prouinces: But whereas the Angel by the three hornes vnderstandeth three kings, this is no
proper sense, to vnderstand by these three kings, the authoritie of naming the Proconsuls,
which were many; and this power was not extinguished: though it were taken from the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
it remained still in the Emperor: but these three hornes shall be quite pluckt away be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

3. They which take this number for three precisely. 1. Some, which doe vnderstand it
of the Turke, name three kingdomes, which he hath surprised: but therein they agree not:
<hi>Melancthon</hi> setteth downe <hi>Egypt, Syria,</hi> and <hi>Cilicia: Osiander,</hi> and <hi>Pappus, Asia, Grecia,</hi> and
<hi>Egypt: Vatablus</hi> nameth the Empire of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and the kingdome of <hi>Egypt</hi> for two,
the third is not yet subdued to the Turke, which he nameth not: But the Turke hath many
more then three kingdomes vnder him.</p>
                        <p>4. They which imagine a certaine Antichrist to come in the ende of the world, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
these three kings, of <hi>Egypt, Africa, Aethiopia,</hi> whom when Antichrist hath subdued,
the other seuen shall yeeld themselues: so <hi>Hierome,</hi> whom <hi>Lyranus, gloss. ordinar. Hugo,
Pintus,</hi> followe.</p>
                        <p>But this conceit of this supposed Antichrist, is confuted before, quest. 27. 5. and it is said
that this horne shall pull away onely 3. hornes, not that he shall subdue all the tenne.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi>Bullinger</hi> making the Pope that Romane Antichrist to be this little horne, by the three
kings would haue signified, <hi>Leo</hi> the 3. the Emperour of Greece, whome <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 2.
excommunicated for condemning of images, and tooke from him the Exarchateship of
<hi>Rauenna:</hi> and <hi>Childerichus</hi> king of Fraunce was deposed by Pope <hi>Zacharie:</hi> and Pope <hi>Leo</hi>
the 3. obtained of <hi>Charles</hi> the Exarchateship and gouernement of Italie, the <hi>Longobards</hi>
beeing ouercome, and their king <hi>Desiderius</hi> slaine: But this cannot be the meaning for these
reasons. 1. this little horne signifieth one king specially, then it is not properly referred to
many Popes, one succeeding another. 2. the Popes deposed and did excommunicate
many more kings and Emperours beside these. 3. and these 3. hornes must be plucked away
before the other, to make a way for the little horne, not after this horne is exalted.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi>Palychronius,</hi> who by this little horne rightly expoundeth <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> yet
is deceiued, in taking the <hi>Persians, Aegyptians,</hi> and <hi>Iewes,</hi> for these three hornes, <hi>ex Oeco.</hi>
for the Egyptians had an horne by themselues, and the Iewes could not be an horne of this

<hi>Ptolome Philopator,</hi> whom he expelled out of Syria, ioyning with <hi>Antiochus</hi> the

his sonne, as he returned from Rome: But in this last is <hi>Iunius</hi> deceiued, for <hi>Demetrius</hi> the
sonne raigned after <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> therefore he was not killed by him, not deposed:
Neither could this <hi>Demetrius</hi> beeing an hostage at Rome, procure while <hi>Epiphanes</hi> liued, to
be king of Syria, but after his death he was receiued by the Syrians, and first hauing killed
<hi>Lysias</hi> tutor of <hi>Antiochus Eupator,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Epiphanes,</hi> and then <hi>Eupator</hi> himselfe, he
got the kingdome: Thus <hi>Ioseph. lib. 12. Antiquit. c. 15. Livius. lib. 46. Appian:</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius</hi>
is none of the tenne hornes, quest. 26. therefore he could be none of the 3. hornes
which were of the tenne: some other agree with <hi>Iunius,</hi> that these three forenamed were
the three kings, but <hi>Demetrius</hi> they thinke was not killed, but onely deposed and kept from

opinion, that he shall be possessed of the deuill, who shall rule in him both in bodie and
soule: the spirit of Sathan shall not be hypostatically ioyned vnto him, as the Godhead
in Christ, but Sathan shall dwell in him, as in those that are possessed, not tormenting
him, but in stirring of him vp, and instructing him, and teaching him many hid things:

                        <head>30. Quest. Of the description of the glorious manner of Gods
iudgement, expressed v. 9. to v. 15.</head>
                        <p>Here first is set forth the forme and manner of the iudgement it selfe, v. 9. 10. then the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution,
v. 12. to v. 15. In the forme of iudgement foure things are described, 1. he which
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:18834:116"/>
sate vpon the throne. 2. the throne it selfe. 3. the assistants. 4. the processe in iudgement.</p>
                        <p>1. He which sate vpon the throne is described by three essentiall properties. 1. his <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,</hi>
he is called the Auncient of daies, which also sheweth his infinite wisdome, which is
found in the auncient. 2. his <hi>authoritie,</hi> his garments were white: which <hi>Hugo</hi> applieth to
Christs transfiguration in mount Tabor: but the white garment was a signe of authoritie, as
Ioseph, when he was aduanced by Pharaoh, had a white garment put vpon him. 3. by his
haire, which was as pure wooll, is signified his <hi>innocencie</hi> and <hi>integritie</hi> in iudgement.</p>
                        <p>2. First it is said, that thrones were set, in the plural: which some read, thrones were cast
downe, vnderstanding the thrones and kingdomes of the former beasts, <hi>Iun. Polan. Vatab.</hi>
but it is better interpreted, <hi>thrones were set vp:</hi> as the 24. Elders had their seates about the
throne, Apoc. 4. 4. these thrones were set as inferiour seates for the Lords assistants the
Angels, which title of honour is vouchsafed vnto them in Scripture, <hi>Calvin.</hi> then the throne
of God is set forth by three properties; it is <hi>fierie,</hi> which sheweth that all things are manifest
vnto God: it hath <hi>wheeles,</hi> which signifieth the celeritie of Gods iudgements: and a <hi>fierie
streame</hi> issued forth, which sheweth the power of Gods iudgements, which none can resist,
no more then the course of a streame can be staied.</p>
                        <p>3. The Angels, as Gods assistants in this iudgement, are described, 1. by their number,
thousand thousands, and ten thousand thousands, a finite number beeing taken for an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite.
2. by their office, they are saide to minister vnto God. 3. by their alacritie and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines,
they stand before him, as readie at his becke to execute his will.</p>
                        <p>4. The processe is set forth, the bookes were opened; the bookes of euery mans acts; as
Princes in their iudgements haue bookes and euidence brought forth: not that God nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
any information, as terrene Iudges, but to shew the equitie of his iudgement.</p>
                        <p>2. The execution followeth, which is of two sorts, in iustice, in condemning the beasts,
v. 11, 12. and in mercie, in setting vp the kingdome of his sonne Christ and his Church, v.
13, 14.</p>

                        <head>31. Quest. Whether the finall iudgement in the ende of the
world be here described.</head>
                        <p>1. Some thinke that the forme of the finall iudgement of the world is here set forth, as
they which either by the little horne vnderstand Antichrist, who (as they imagine) shall
come in the ende of the world, as <hi>Lyran. Hug.</hi> and likewise they which by the fourth beast
vnderstand the Romane Empire, or the Turks, as <hi>Bullin. Oecol. Osian.</hi> But seeing this vision,
and that of the <hi>Image,</hi> c. 2. in effect is all one: as there the stone cut out without hands, that
dashed the image in pieces, signifieth Christ in his first, not in his second comming: for that
stone grew into a mountaine and filled the earth, but after Christ commeth to iudgement,
his kingdome shall be at the full, it shall not afterward encrease: see this confirmed by other
reasons, c. 2. qu. 55. So this iudgement here described must be referred vnto Christs first
comming. And if the fourth beast be the kingdome of the <hi>Seleucians,</hi> as is before prooued
at large, then these thrones must be set, when that beast was destroied.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Burgensis</hi> is of opinion, that the first vision concerneth the first comming of Christ,
when he dashed the image in pieces, in that all idolatrie of the Gentiles was abolished at
his comming: but this he referreth to the finall iudgement, when all the kingdomes and
Monarchies of the earth shall be destroied, and Christ onely shall raigne. But <hi>Thoring</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
exception here to <hi>Burgensis,</hi> that all idolatrie was not abolished at Christs comming,
seeing in many nations it continued long after Christs comming into the world, and yet in
Asia, Africa, and some places of Europe is practised: This rather maketh against <hi>Burgensis,</hi>
that seeing in this vision there is a description of the foure Monarchies, which were repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
in that image, c. 2. that the same manner of iudgement by the comming of Christ, for
the destruction of those Monarchies, is in both places signified.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Calvin</hi> misliketh that this place should be vnderstood of the second comming of
Christ, and yet he holdeth this fourth beast to be the Romane Empire: both these can not
stand together: for the Romane Empire was not iudged nor dissolued at the first comming
of Christ.</p>
                        <p>4. Therefore by the iudgement of God here shewed in this manner to the Prophet, is
better vnderstood the processe of the diuine iustice against these Monarchies, which were
all dissolued before the first comming of Christ. In like manner is the iudgement of God
described in the ouerthrow of <hi>Senacherib,</hi> which came against Ierusalem, Psal. 76<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </p>
                        <p>5. But yet we so vnderstand here the iudgement of God vpon these kingdomes at the
first comming of Christ, as that it is also a type and figure of the finall iudgement: <hi>this iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
beginneth at the first comming of Christ, Genevens.</hi> and shall be perfected at his second

                        <p>2. Some by the Auncient of daies, vnderstand Christ the Mediatour, <hi>Christus antiquus

                        <p>1. The Lord applieth himselfe to our weaknes and imbecillitie: for although the Lord
be Iudge for euer, yet he doth not alwaies exercise iudgement: So then while the Lord
suffereth the wicked to preuaile in the world, and deferreth their punishment, he seemeth

                        </p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Gregorie</hi> seemeth to be of opinion,<note place="margin">Hom. 34. in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangel.</note> that there are more men put good and bad toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
then Angels good and bad: for first he setteth this downe, that there shall be as many
men elected as Angels: but there are farre more men damned, then are saued: contrariwise
he thinketh that there are more elect Angels then reprobate angels, as some would gather
by that place, Apoc. 12. 4. how the dragon with his taile drew the third part of the starres of
heauen: If then the elect men be equiualent in number to the elect Angels, and the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
men are more then the elect, but the reprobate angels are fewer then the elect Angels;
it will follow that the number of men is greater, then of Angels. But this opinion is builded
vpon an vncerten ground, that the number of the elect among men, is equiualent to the
number of the elect Angels.</p>
                        <p>3. A third opinion is, that the number of Angels, farre exceedeth the number of men. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius</hi>
saith, that some thought, the Angels in number were more then men, as 99. to one;
which they would gather out of that parable of the lost sheepe, when the shepheard left
99. to seeke that one. <hi>Lyranus,</hi> whome <hi>Pererius</hi> followeth, maketh this collection, that as
the celestiall bodies the starres doe in bignesse farre exceede the things below, for one starre
is bigger then the earth: in the same proportion because Angels doe not exceede men in
quantitie, they doe exceede them, <hi>incomparabiliter in numerositate,</hi> without comparison in
number.</p>
                        <p>4. But these things are more boldly then certenly affirmed: out of this place no such
thing can be gathered: for it is agreed of all hands, that here a certen and finite number is
put for an indefinite: as <hi>Hierome</hi> saith, <hi>non quia ministrorum Dei numerus definitus sit, &amp;c.</hi>
not that the number of Gods ministers is here defined, &amp;c. but because a greater number
can not be expressed by mans speech. Yet as touching this question, some things may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenly
be resolued vpon, some things are doubtfull: 1. that the number of elect men is
smaller then of the reprobate, is certen: for many enter in at the broad gate, and few finde
out the narrow way, Matth. 7. 13, 14. 2. But the number of the elect Angels is greater
then of those which fell: because the Prophet saith, when he shewed the young man the
Lords fierie horse and chariots round about vpon the mountaines, <hi>They that are with vs, are
more then they which be with them,</hi> 2. king. 6. 16. And in Scripture the good Angels are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in greater numbers, then the euill: we read in the Gospel of 12. legions of Angels,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:18834:117"/>
Matth. 26. 53. but of one legion of deuills, Mark. 5. 9. And in this place, tenne thousand
thousands of Angels are named. These things are certen. These following are probable.
3. That the number of the Elect men is greater then of the euill and reprobate angels, as
<hi>Augustine</hi> thinketh,<note place="margin">lib. 22. de civ. ca.</note> that the angels which fell shall be supplied out of the numbers of the
Elect: As our blessed Sauiout said vnto his Apostles, <hi>Haue I not chosen you twelue, and one of
you is a deuill,</hi> Ioh. 6. 70. there was one deuill to 12. elect Apostles. 4. Likewise the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the elect Saints may seeme to be greater then of the elect Angels, by that vision A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poc.
4. the foure beasts about the throne represent the blessed Angels, the 24. Elders the
Saints. 5. It may be also coniectured, that the Elect Angels are more in number then the

                        <p>1. <hi>Hierome,</hi> whome <hi>Lyranus,</hi> and <hi>gloss. ordinar.</hi> follow, vnderstandeth here two bookes,
the one of life, which is held in Gods hand, the other of death, <hi>qui tenebitur in manu accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toris,</hi>
which shall be held in the accusers hand, which is the deuill. But 1. as <hi>Augustine</hi> saith,
<hi>non sic datur liber mortis, &amp;c.</hi> there is not found to be a booke of death, as there is of life;
onely they which are elected are said to be written, and the reprobate not to be written in
the booke of life. 2. And whereas <hi>Pererius</hi> answereth, that though there be no such
booke of death with God, yet the deuill may, haue such a booke: neither doth the deuill
know who are saued, who condemned, and therefore he can haue no such booke: neither
is there any booke mentioned in Scripture, but of the Lords writing, as Moses saith, Exod.
32. 32. <hi>Rase me out of the booke of life which thou hast written.</hi> 3. Apoc. 20. 12. there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bookes saide to be opened beside the booke of life; then is not the booke of life here
comprehended.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Augustine</hi> by these bookes,<note place="margin">lib. 2 de civit. Dei, c. 14.</note> vnderstandeth the Saints which shall come with Christ to
iudgement, In whose godly life and conuersation the good will of God appeared: and in
them the wicked, as in bookes may see, what they should haue done: But by the opening of
these bookes not onely the wicked, but the rightehus are iudged: Apoc. 20. 12. <hi>The dead
were iudged of those things, which are written in the bookes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Beda</hi> by these bookes which shall be opened in the day of the Lord, vnderstandeth
the sacred Scriptures, according to the which mens doings shall be examined, and sentence
giuen according to the same: But the Scriptures are called a booke, Apoc. 10. 9. not bookes.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Calvin</hi> by the opening of the bookes, would haue signified the manifestation of the
knowledge of God vnto the world at the comming of Christ, which before lay hid: But
here bookes are not opened for instruction vnto saluation, but for triall and examination
vnto iudgement.</p>
                        <p>5. Therefore these bookes are better interpreted to be euery ones conscience, wherein
all their doings good and bad are written: whereof S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh, <hi>Their conscience also
bearing witnesse, and their thoughts accusing one an other, or excusing, in the day when God
shall iudge the secrets of men by Iesus Christ,</hi> Rom. 2. 15. And thus are those bookes interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
Apoc. 20. 12. <hi>The dead, were iudged of those things, which were written in the bookes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

fourth beast are examined before sentence giuen.</p>
                        <p>6. But as <hi>Chrysostome</hi> well noteth, these bookes are not opened, that God should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue

this of the destruction of Antichrist, in the ende of the world, whome Christ shall
destroy with the spirit of his mouth: so also <hi>Vatablus, Antichristus significatur &amp; eius mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra,</hi>
Antichrist is signified, and his members. But in this sense this prophesie should not yet
be fulfilled, whereas it is euident, that all this was fulfilled before the first comming of
Christ.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Calvin</hi> applying this to the Romane Empire, thinketh that the beast was destroyed
when the Empire beganne to decay, which was immediatly after <hi>Traiane</hi> the Emperours
time: for after that time, well nigh these 15. hundred yeares, <hi>nullus Romano potitus est
Imperio,</hi> none hath enioyed the Romane Empire: But, though the state of that Empire was
somewhat empayred, yet it was not then wholly destroied, but continued in great power
and glorie many hundred yeares after <hi>Traians</hi> time: but here the beast is slaine, and his body
vtterly destroied.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Bullinger</hi> expoundeth this of the ruine of the Papall kingdome.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Osiander</hi> of the decay of the Turkish dominion, togither with the Romane Empire:
so also <hi>Oecolampad.</hi> expoundeth it of the destruction of the Pope and Turke togither, by
that prophesie Apoc. 19. 20. of the taking of the beast, and the false prophet. But these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies
must be distinguished: Daniels extendeth to the first comming of Christ, Iohns Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation
to the second.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi>Iunius</hi> in his Commentarie, applieth this prophesie vnto <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes:</hi> his
iudgement is set forth in three degrees. 1. <hi>the beast is slaine:</hi> the death of <hi>Epiphanes</hi> is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shewed,
who hauing receiued euill tidings first at <hi>Persepolis,</hi> then at <hi>Elymais</hi> fell into a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
and incurable disease, as is set forth, 1. Macchab. 6. 2. Macchab. 9. 2. <hi>his bodie is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed:</hi>
his armies were ouerthrowne, and all his posteritie rooted out: for <hi>Antiochus Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pator</hi>
his sonne raigned not aboue 3. yeares, and in him the whole familie of <hi>Epiphanes</hi> was
extinct, and the kingdome returned to the right heires. 3. <hi>his bodie is giuen to the burning
fire:</hi> whereby is signified the grieuous torments of his disease, which he endured, 2. Macch. 9.</p>
                        <p>6. But seeing <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> is the little horne of the fourth beast, and this iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
belongeth to the whole beast; here rather is described the ruine and destruction of the
whole kingdome of the <hi>Seleucians:</hi> the meaning then is this rather: 1. that the power of
the <hi>Seleucians</hi> after <hi>Epiphanes</hi> began to abate, and their kingdome to be much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>olested by
enemies without, the <hi>Parthians</hi> and <hi>Armenians,</hi> and by commotions within: and so the
beast was slaine:<note place="margin">See appendix in the ende of the booke, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise 1. argu. 8. answ. 3. &amp; argu. 11. answ. 1.</note> then the bodie of the beast was destroyed: the kingdome beeing taken from
the house of the <hi>Seleucians,</hi> and giuen to <hi>Tygranes</hi> king of Armenia, as <hi>Iustine</hi> writeth, <hi>lib.</hi>
40. And this bodie was giuen to the fire, when <hi>Tigranes</hi> beeing taken, the kingdome was

prolonged.</head>
                        <p>1. Some doe interpret these words by the time past, that before the destruction of this
last beast, the other three had beene destroyed: so <hi>Calvin, Vatablus: ante interitum quartae
bestiae evanuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,</hi> they had vanished away before the ouerthrow of the fourth beast, <hi>Osiand.</hi>
And though mention be made hereof after the destruction of the fourth beast, yet the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
beasts were before remooued and taken out of the way, <hi>Calvin.</hi> But to what ende is it
said that after the dominion of the other three beasts was taken away, their liues were prolonged,
if there had not beene some remainder of the other Monarchies, the <hi>Chaldean, Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
and <hi>Grecian,</hi> after their dominion ceased.</p>
                        <p>2. Some on the contrarie hee thinke, that here is signified a prorogation and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of other kingdomes, after the fourth beast is destroied: for after Antichrist is destroied,
<hi>non statim omnes reges sine onima regna cessabu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

of the earth cease, but they shall haue a time giuen them to repent, <hi>Hugo.</hi> But it is
euident by the interpretation of the Angel, v. 26, 27. that after the dominion of the fourth
beast is taken away, then all these dominions shall cease, and all the kingdome and domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
shall be giuen to the people of God: Christ onely shall raigne.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Bullinger</hi> thinketh, that here is shewed a difference betweene the ruine of this fourth
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:18834:118"/>
kingdome, and the other three: <hi>innuit nullum ex omnibus regnis tam horribilem consequu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
esse exitum, &amp;c.</hi> he sheweth that none of all the other kingdomes, had so horrible an
ende, as this last. True it is that there is a difference, for there was some remainder of the
other Monarchies, after they were depriued of their dominion, but this fourth had nothing
remayning, it was vtterly destroyed: yet this is not all: here is described the ende of all those
kingdomes together: that although the Lord had forborne them a great while, yet at length
they are iudged.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> and <hi>Pellican</hi> make this the meaning, that whereas in the dissolution of
the other kingdoms, one still succeeded another, <hi>post hunc quartum non sequutura alia,</hi> after
this fourth, which he expoundeth of Antichrist, there shall followe no other: But this accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to our former exposition (the fourth beast beeing vnderstood to be the kingdome of
the Seleucians) cannot stand: for the Romane Monarchie succeeded, which destroyed all
the rest.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi>Hierome,</hi> whom the <hi>ordinar. gloss.</hi> followeth, so taketh this prophesie, as that toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with Antichrist, <hi>Romanum imperium, &amp; alia omnia regna delabuntur,</hi> the Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
and all other kingdomes shall be destroyed in the ende of the world: But this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
is not to be referred vnto the second comming of Christ, it must be vnderstood of his first
comming, as is before shewed, quest. 31.</p>
                        <p>6. The <hi>interlinear, gloss.</hi> expoundeth these words, <hi>their liues were prolonged,</hi> of the elect
and Saints, which should liue vnder the raigne of Antichrist: But here is no mention made
of the Saints, but of the beasts, whose liues should be prolonged till the time appointed.</p>
                        <p>7. <hi>Lyranus,</hi> wheras it is said, <hi>their liues were prolonged for a certaine time and season,</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth
by the first time, the persecution of the faithfull before the first comming of Christ,
by the second the persecution following vnto the second comming of Christ: But it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
that all these fowre beasts must be destroyed before the Messiah should come in the
flesh, and take possession at his ascension of his euerlasting kingdome.</p>
                        <p>8. Wherefore this is the meaning, that together with the fourth beast should be destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the remainder of the other kingdomes, and all should be dissolued by the Romanes: there
was some reliques of the ancient Monarchies, after their dominion ceased, as of the Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians
in the Armenians, of the Persians in the kingdome of the Parthians, of the Grecians in
the kingdome of Macedonia, and Egypt: But all these were vtterly extinguished by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,
<hi>Iun. Pol. Perses</hi> the last king of Macedonia was subdued by <hi>P. Aemilius,</hi> and the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

then some 90. yeares after that the kingdome of Syria was by <hi>Pompey</hi> reduced to the

                        <head>Quest. 40. Why it is said, v. 13. one like the

                        <p>1. <hi>Lyranus</hi> thinketh that this note of similitude is added, <hi>quia plus est quam filius homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi>
because Christ is more then the sonne of man, he is also the sonne of God: But the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
describeth here the figure of man, which he saw: the Godhead could not be figured.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Pintus</hi> giueth this sense: <hi>quasi non similitudinem significat, sed certissimam confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem:</hi>
this word <hi>as</hi> or like, signifieth not here a similitude, but a most certaine confirmation,
as the word is taken, Ioh. 1. 14. <hi>we sawe the glorie thereof, as the glorie of the onely begotten
sonne of the father.</hi> But it cannot be so taken here, because Christ was not yet incarnate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> vnderstandeth this to be spoken of Christ now tryumphing in glorie,
he was as the sonne of man, that is true man, but not now mortall and subiect to humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,
as other men are, and therefore he is said to be like: he is not now altogether the
same: But as yet the sonne of man had not taken vpon him our nature, with the infirmities
thereof: therefore this cannot conueniently be vnderstood of the laying aside and putting off
those infirmities.</p>
                        <p>4. The <hi>ordinar. gloss.</hi> expoundeth this by that place, Philippi. 2. 7. <hi>He tooke vpon him
the forme of a seruant, and was made like vnto man:</hi> But in this place, as <hi>Calvin</hi> well no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
<hi>non loquitur de essentia naturae humanae, sed de statu,</hi> the Apostle speaketh not of the
essence of humane nature, but of the state and condition: that Christ came in a lowely
state &amp; condition, as the Apostle said before in the forme of a seruant: But the sonne of man
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:18834:119"/>
is here seene in the clouds, and in glory: his humble and abiect state cannot be here signified.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi>Iunius</hi> in his commentarie giueth this sense, <hi>in similitudine carnis peccati verus hominis
silius,</hi> the true sonne of man in the similitude of sinnefull flesh, as the Apostle speaketh,
Rom. 8. 3. And therefore he is said to be as the Sonne of man.</p>
                        <p>6. But the better sense is: that he is said to be as the Sonne of man, because he sawe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a figure of the sonne of man: for at this time, when Daniel sawe this, he was not yet the
Sonne of man, but was to be borne, and become man in his time: <hi>Bulling. quia nondum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duerat
Christus carnem nostram,</hi> because Christ had not yet put on our flesh: yea after
Christ was incarnate, when he was seene figuratiuely in vision, he is said to be as the Sonne
of man, as Reuel. 14. 14. <hi>I sawe vpon the cloud one sitting; as the sonne of man:</hi> because he

malitiously blinde, and grossely absurd: to apply that to the terrene state, which is here
meant of Christs spiritual and eternall kingdome: and the auncient of dayes which is God,
to make a mortall man: and the sonne of man comming in the clouds, to vnderstand in base
and suppliant manner to come vnto a mortall Prince.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>R. Saadia</hi> vnderstandeth this also of the Messiah, that he shall come as was prophesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of him sitting vpon an asse, that is, in great lowlinesse, and in the clouds, armies of Angels
shall attend vpon him, and that great dominion shall be giuen, as the auncient of dayes, that
is, <hi>sicut domini filiorum hominum,</hi> as they which are Lords among men, &amp;c. But herein al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
is his errour: 1. he confoundeth the first comming of Christ, which was in humilitie, and
his second comming, which should be in glorie. 2. he dreameth of a temporall kingdome.
3. he misinterpreteth the <hi>auncient of dayes,</hi> which he applyeth to mortall men.</p>
                        <p>3. The most of the Christian writers doe here vnderstand the second comming of Christ
to iudgement: as <hi>Lyran. Hugo. gloss.</hi> So also <hi>Oecolampad. Bulling. Pererius</hi> granteth that
in the vision of the image, c. 2. the stone cut out without hands doth signifie Christ in his
first comming: but here he thinketh that Christ is described comming vnto iudgement, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
so it is said, Matth. 24. <hi>then shall they see the Sonne of man comming in the clouds,
&amp;c.</hi> And because this apparition of the Sonne of man followeth after the destruction of
Antichrist.</p>
                        <p>But 1. Christ also ascending to his father was taken vp in the clouds. 2. the little horne
of the fourth beast, signifieth not Antichrist, but typically and by way of analogie: it hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storically
is meant of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> as is before shewed. 3. seeing the same Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies
and kingdomes are described in the vision, c. 2. and this, c. 7. the same destruction
and extinguishing of the kingdomes in both places must be insinuated. 4. neither is this
aptly referred to Christs second comming, but to that his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, which followed vpon the
dissolution of that fourth kingdome, which was of the Seleucians in Syria: as is shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
quest. 22. and quest. 26. 5. <hi>Iunius</hi> vnderstandeth the approaching of Christ to the
Auncient of dayes, of Christs ascension vnto his father: but the comming in or with the
clouds, he applyeth to Christs comming into the world, to finish the worke of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>deitas illius figuratur aduentu è nubibus,</hi> his deitie is prefigured, by his comming out of

the sonne of man, yet differed much from all mankind, &amp;c. his beginning was from heauen,
ours is from the earth.</p>
                        <p>6. But all these are better ioyned together, to set forth the glorious ascension of our
Blessed Sauiour: which type we see fulfilled, Act. 1. where Christ ascended vp in a cloud:
by this approaching to the Auncient of dayes, is signified his equalitie with his father: he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached

7. And that this part of the vision is rather vnderstood of Christs first comming into
the world, and his returning to his father, then of his second comming to iudgement, these
two reasons out of the text it selfe may perswade. 1. because this dominion is here giuen
vnto Christ: but Christ receiued his kingdome at his resurrection from the dead, when he
said to his Apostles, <hi>all power is giuen vnto me in heauen, and earth: tunc regnum suum auspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catus
est,</hi> then Christ beganne his kingdome, <hi>Calv.</hi> it was not deferred till his second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming:
<hi>Oecolampadius</hi> answereth, <hi>nouo modo datur illi gloria, quam in membris suis accipit,
&amp;c.</hi> then after a newe manner glorie shall be giuen him, because he shall receiue it in his
members, &amp;c. But it is euident, that this is meant of Christs receiuing this kingdome in
himselfe, though for his members: because he is brought to the Auncient of dayes, as it
were to sit downe in the throne with him, which cannot be vnderstood of his members. 2.
the kingdome vnder the whole heauen is said to be giuen vnto the holy people, v. 27. but
the celestiall and heauenly kingdome cannot be said to be vnder heauen: therefore it is not
meant of the Church tryumphant in heauen, but of the Militant in earth.</p>

                        <head>Quest. 43. That this kingdome is the kingdome
of Christ our Blessed Lord and
Sauiour.</head>
                        <p>1. The Iewes seeke by their cauils and shiftes to obscure this cleare prophesie, and first
obiect, that Christs kingdome is not here vnderstood: Secondly, they argue, that Christ is
that little home, which came out of the fourth beast.</p>
                        <p>1. The first they would thus prooue. 1. the fifth kingdome must destroy the fourth beast,
but Christ at his comming did not dissolue the Romane Empire, it then most of al flourished
vnder <hi>Augustus</hi> and <hi>Tiberius.</hi> 2. the fifth kingdome must be distinct from the fourth: but
the kingdome of Christ flourished vnder the Romane Empire, beeing aduanced by
<hi>Constantine,</hi> and other Christian Emperours. 3. this fift kingdome shall be of all other the
most mightie: but there are other kingdomes mightier then the Christans, as the Turkish
power. 4. this fift kingdome must continue for euer: but the kingdome of Christianitie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth,
and is more and more empayred.</p>
                        <p>2. That Christ is that little horne, out of the fourth beast, and so consequently not this
fifth kingdome, thus they obiect. 1. this horne was little in respect of the obscure beginning,
so was Christs rising vp obscure. 2. this horne speaketh proud things: so Christ said he was
without sinne, that he was the sonne of God. 3. this horne changeth times and lawes: so
Christ violated the Sabbath, and abolished the ceremonies of Moses. 4. and as this horne
was to continue a time, two times, and an halfe, that is, three yeares and an halfe: so Christ
preached iust so many yeares.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. Their reasons vpon the first point are easily answered. 1. It is denied that
the Romane Empire is the fourth beast, but rather the kingdome of the Seleucians in
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:18834:120"/>
Syria, which was destroyed before the comming of the Messiah. 2. And so Christs kingdome
was distinct from the fourth, and from all other terrene kingdomes and dominions: they are
earthly and temporall: Christs is spirituall and eternall: the Christian faith is maintained
vnder the Romane Empire: yet it is farre differing from it: the Iewes here imagine, that this
fift kingdome should be a temporall and externall kingdome in the world, such as they
dreame of their Messiah, but therein they are deceiued: for our blessed Sauiour himsefe saith,
that he came not to be ministred vnto, but to minister, Matth. 21. and he said to Pilate, that
his kingdome was not of this world: yea the thiefe who was conuerted vpon the crosse vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
as much, saying to Christ, <hi>remember me when thou commest into thy kingdome:</hi>
therefore Christ had no temporall kingdome in this world, but spirituall, in which respect it
was diuerse and distinct from all other earthly kingdomes: See more hereof cap. 2. que. 58.
3. And though this kingdome of the Messiah doth not alwaies shewe it selfe mightier in
this world, in externall power, then other kingdomes: yet the spirituall power thereof farre
exceedeth all temporall dominion; seeing euen those terrene powers, which persecuted the
gospel of Christ, were by the power thereof subdued vnto the faith, as <hi>Constantine</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecour,
and other Christian Emperours and Kings, which maintained the Christian faith:
according to the prophesie of Isay, 49. 23. <hi>Kings shall be thy nursing fathers,</hi> and <hi>Queenes
thy nursing mothers.</hi> 4. though the terrene bounds and limits of those kingdomes, which
prof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>sse the gospel of Christ, may sometime be enlarged, sometime empayred: yet the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
kingdome of Christ is not conquered, which triumpheth in the middes of the greatest
trialls and afflictions of his seruants: and it is most certaine, though the Church of Christ
may be translated from one kingdome to another, yet it shall remayne as long as the earth
endureth, and after shall raigne in heauen for euer.</p>
                        <p>2. Concerning the other obiection, that Christ should be this little horne. 1. The most
of these arguments are answered before, quest. 27. 7. to the which place I referre the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
2. Christ violated not the Sabbath, but taught the right vse of the Sabbath against the
superstitious obseruations of the Iewes. 3. though this little horne was to rage against the
Saints, 3. yeares and a halfe, it followeth not because Christ preached no longer, that he
should be this little horne: euerie meane Logician knoweth, what an inartificiall kind of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning
it is to conclude affirmatiuely in the second figure: as thus: <hi>this little horne shall rage</hi>
3. <hi>yeares and an halfe, Christ preached 3. yeares and halfe, Ergo, he is this little horne:</hi> Beside
there is great difference betweene raging and tyrannizing against the Saints, and preaching
to the Saints: so that beside the fayling in the forme of the argument, they assume not right.
4. But that Christ no wayes can be this little horne, it is euident: for these hornes must be
kings, and kings of the fourth kingdome or Monarchie, and it must plucke away three
kings before it, but Christ was no king neither of the Syrian, nor Romane kingdome: neither
can it be shewed how he remooued 3. kings before him. 2. and after this horne is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
it is said the Saints should haue the kingdome: but after Christ was put to death, the
people of the Iewes were more afflicted, then they were before: and within fewe yeares
their citie and Temple were destroyed by the Romanes: Therefore this their assertion, is
most blaspemous and absurd, that Christ should be this little horne. 3. Those Rabbines are
more reasonable, which doe vnderstand this kingdome of the Messiah, as <hi>R. Iesua, Ab. Ez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,
R. Saadia:</hi> though herein they fayle in dreaming of a temporall kingdome, which should
be raised by their Messiah.</p>

                           <pb n="229" facs="tcp:18834:120"/>
2. Of this opinion was <hi>Papias,</hi> whom <hi>Ireneus</hi> affirmeth to haue beene one of Iohns

kingdome which they imagine, shall be but for a thousand yeares. 3. They which held this
opinion, thought that the last of the sixe thousand yeares was begunne many yeares since:
<hi>Augustine</hi> thought that in his time the last of the sixe thousand was entred, following the
erroneous account of the Septuag. from the beginning of the world: and <hi>Lactantius</hi> who
liued in Constantines time, thought that there were but 200. yeares remayning of the sixe
thousand: In their opinion then, now the eight thousand yeare should be a foote, and yet

                        <p>4. But as concerning that place in the Reuelation,<note place="margin">The thousand yeares expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, Apoc. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

are diuerse expositions thereof. 1. <hi>Pererius</hi> by the first resurrection vnderstandeth the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance
of the soules from the bodies, &amp; their receiuing vp into heauen: &amp; by the thousand
yeares he would haue signified, taking a finite number for an indefinite, all that time, which
the soules of the Saints should reigne in heauen with Christ til his second comming: But this
cannot be the meaning: for after these thousand yeares expired, Satan shall be loose: now at
Christs comming Sathan shall be more bound then euer he was, and receiue his euerlasting
doome.</p>
                        <p>2. Some doe vnderstand here the libertie which Christs Church shall haue in earth, but
by a thousand yeares they thinke no definite or certaine time to be expressed: but in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall
predictions, numbers must be taken properly and literally, especially, where a time
is limited: as after these 1000. yeares Sathan must be let loose: if now a certaine time be
not defined, before his loosing the Church should haue no certaine direction to expect it,
and so they should haue small vse of this prophesie.</p>
                        <p>3. Some doe vnderstand here precisely so many yeares, as are named: and some beginne
the account from Christs natiuitie, and ende it in the time of Pope <hi>Siluester</hi> the second: <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevens.</hi>
Some beginne in the 36. yeare after Christ, and extend the 1000. yeares vnto the
time of <hi>Hildebrand</hi> called <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 7. that forcerer, whom Satan vsed as his instrument
in oppressing the Church of Christ, <hi>Iun. annot. in Apocalyps.</hi> But both these doe make the
300. yeares of persecution vnder the Romane Emperours, a part of this thousand yeares
when Sathan should be bound, which cannot be, for then Satan raged against Christ and
his members.</p>
                        <p>4. Therefore these thousand yeares for that reason must beginne, after the 10. persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
vnder the Romane Empire, in the time of <hi>Constantine</hi> the great: from thence Sathan

other kingdomes.</head>
                        <p>1. It excelleth all other kingdomes in the continuance and diuturnitie: the spirituall
kingdome of our Blessed Sauiour hath alreadie continued 16. hundred yeares, and shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
vnto the ende of the world, and be perfited for euer to remaine in the next. Among
earthly Monarchies, the kingdome of the Assyrians was of the longest time: but it reached
not to a 1400. yeares: but the kingdome of Christ shall be euerlasting. 2. none of these ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene
kingdomes was vniuersall ouer all the world: but all nations and languages haue beene
subdued to the spirituall kingdome of Christ. 3. It excelleth in force and efficacie: other
kingdomes haue but power ouer the goods and bodies of men: but this kingdome of Christ
worketh vpon the soule and conscience. 4. Other kingdomes doe but intend the publike
peace, and maintenance of ciuill societie: this kingdome deliuereth men from the dominion
of sinne and Sathan, and planteth in them true veritie and pietie. 5. Other kingdomes haue
beene enlarged by force and armes: but Christs kingdome hath beene propagated by humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
and patience: Our Blessed Sauiour hath founded by his glorious passion, and his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
seruants the Martyrs, haue by their patient &amp; constant sufferings propagated the church.
6. This kingdome in the excellencie of lawes and precepts farre surpasseth all other: If the
Prophet Dauid spake such excellent things of the lawe of Moses, Psal. 19. 4. <hi>The lawe of
the Lord is perfect conuerting the soule, the testimonie of the Lord is sure, and giueth wisedome
vnto the simple:</hi> much more excellent is the Gospel of Christ: which is a perfect rule of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,
which was first preached by the Lord himselfe. 7. They differ in the ende: Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene
kingdomes doe but procure the outward peace and welfare of the people: but the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
and kingdome of Christ doe bring the faithfull vnto euerlasting life. 8. Lastly, these
kingdomes are diuerse in respect of their gouernours: These terrene dominions are ruled
many times by vnwise, often by vniust, but alwaies by infirme, mortall, and weake men: But

<hi>the most high Saints shall take the kingdome, &amp;c. and possesse the kingdome for euer, yea for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
and euer.</hi> 3. Some referre the first clause to the beasts, that they shall take the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
the second to the Saints, who shall possesse it for euer.</p>
                        <p>1. They which so vnderstand these words, as though these foure kingdomes which
should rise out of the earth, shall possesse the kingdome of the Saints. 1. Some. by the
kingdome vnderstand the earth, which is due vnto the Saints, and in <hi>Abraham</hi> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to the faithfull, which these foure Monarchies shall possesse for euer: that is, till the
world be restored by Christ. <hi>Genevens. Iun.</hi> 2. Or it is said for euer, in respect of the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
desire of the Saints that are afflicted, who shall thinke the time very long before they
be deliuered, <hi>Calvin.</hi> 3. Some doe thus interpret it: <hi>for euer, yea for euer and euer,</hi> that is,
for diuers ages, shall these Monarchies keepe the people of God in subiection: for the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans
held them and their countrey in bondage 70. yeares, the Persians 207. yeares, the
Seleucians 148. yeares, which make aboue 400. yeares: foure complete generations, <hi>Polan.</hi>
But all these expositions are confuted by these two arguments. 1. because it seemeth an
hard speech, that the wicked should possesse the kingdome of the Saints for euer and euer:
whereas the kingdome onely of the Messiah shall be euerlasting, v. 14. 2. the kingdome of
the Saints is not here taken for any earthly inheritance, but for a celestiall and spirituall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
as is euident, v. 22. 27. And therefore the other kingdomes are said to rise out of the
earth, to shew a difference betweene this kingdome, and theirs: as the <hi>ordin. gloss.</hi> well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth,
<hi>Whatsoeuer is earthly, shall returne to the earth: Sancti non accipient regnum terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,
sed coeleste,</hi> the Saints shall not receiue an earthly kingdome, but an heauenly.</p>
                        <p>2. They which follow the second reading, that the Saints shall take the kingdome. 1.
Some referre it to the euerlasting kingdome of heauen onely, which they shall receiue at
the comming of Christ: <hi>hoc erit in iudicio finali,</hi> this shall be in the finall iudgement, <hi>Lyran.
post regna mundi finita, post mortem Antichristi,</hi> after all the kingdomes are at an ende, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the death of Antichrist, <hi>gloss. interlin.</hi> But this fift kingdome the Saints shall receiue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
after the dissolution of the foure former kingdomes, which were ended before the
first comming of Christ. 2. <hi>Oecolampad.</hi> likewise vnderstandeth this fift to be the celesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
kingdome, where the faithfull shall raigne with Christ: But it is euident, v. 27. where it is
said, <hi>the kingdomes vnder the whole heauen shall be giuen vnto the people of God,</hi> that this
kingdome of the Saints shall begin in earth: for the heauenly kingdome can not be saide to
be the kingdome vnder heauen. 3. Some thinke that this kingdome of the Saints shall
take place, while the other Monarchies doe yet stand; as vnder the fourth Monarchie of the
Romanes the Church of Christ was propagated ouer all the world, <hi>Pellican:</hi> So also <hi>Bullin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
Ecclesiam per omnes istus Monarchias in mundo futuram,</hi> that the Church shall be in
the world during all these Monarchies: which exposition in part is true, that the Church of
God, the spirituall kingdome of Christ, can not be extinquished, or ouercome, but shall still
continue in the world, the very gates of hell shall not preuaile against it: yet herein it fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth,
that they suppose these Monarchies shall still haue dominion, when this fift kingdome
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:18834:122"/>
taketh place: whereas the contrarie is euident, v. 11, 12. that the fourth beast shall be slaine,
and the dominion taken from the other three beasts, before this kingdome should be giuen
vnto the Saints.</p>
                        <p>4. It remaineth then, that the fift kingdome, beeing the spirituall dominion of the
Church, shall then beginne when the other foure kingdomes are extinguished. And for the
more certen and euident demonstration hereof, these positions shall be here affirmed. 1.
that the kingdome here spoken of, though the foure beasts shall first take it, yet in the ende
shall be possessed of the Saints, not that those Monarchies shall possesse the kingdome of
the Saints: so is it interpreted, v. 22. <hi>The time approched, that the Saints possessed the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>
2. this kingdome of the Saints is begun here in this world, it is not deferred to the
second comming of Christ, though then it shall be perfited: as <hi>Hugo</hi> well interpreteth, <hi>ab
hoc seculo in quo regnant per gratiam, vsque in futurum seculum in quo regnabunt per glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi>
their kingdome shall begin in this world, wherein they raigne by grace, and continue
vnto the next world, wherein they shall raigne in glorie, &amp;c. 3. this kingdome of the Saints
in Christ shall beginne after the dissolution of the foure former Monarchies, as is before
shewed.</p>

of the most high: the Saints in earth. 3. neither by the high Saints, can God himselfe
be vnderstood: the Scripture vseth not in the plural number so to speake of God. 4. some
thus read, the Saints of the high things: that is, to whome belongeth the inheritance of the
high and heauenly things, <hi>Iun. Polan. Calvin.</hi> But it is better ioyned as an <hi>epithete</hi> to Saints:
they are called the high Saints: as v. 27. <hi>the people of the Saints most high:</hi> they are most

                        <p>1. <hi>Hierome,</hi> by changing times and lawes, vnderstandeth that Antichrist shall abolish
and take away all religion: so also <hi>Lyran.</hi> he shall abrogate the worship of God, <hi>&amp; sibi illum

Antichrist which was prophecied of, and is now come into the world, shall not be an open

2. Thess. 2. 9.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Calvin</hi> vnderstanding the Romane Emperours to be this little horne, giueth this
sense, that <hi>omnia iura humana &amp; divina peruertent,</hi> they shall peruert all lawes humane
and diuine: as <hi>Augustus</hi> caused altars to be erected vnto him, though otherwise a ciuill
Prince: <hi>Tiberius</hi> neglected all religion: <hi>Caligula</hi> threatned to banish <hi>Iuppiter</hi> their great
god into Greece, and would often smite his image with his fift: <hi>Domitian</hi> wished that all
the people of Rome had but one necke, that he might smite it off at once: he would haue
made his horse Consul. But though these things may by way of analogie be thus applied,

which is forbidden by the law of God: restraining mariage, which God hath made free

Deus hebdomadam,</hi> God halueth the weeke, because he will not be angrie for euer:
as our blessed Sauiour saith, that for the Elects sake those daies shall be shortned. But it is
euident, that a certaine time is here prefixed and limited: and that by times, yeares are signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
as c: 4. in the vision of the great tree, by seauen times, are vnderstood seauen yeares.</p>
                        <p>2. They which vnderstand here a certen time, 1. some would haue hereby signified so
many yeares, as there be daies in 3. yeares and an halfe: as <hi>R. Levi</hi> saith, that the desolation of
the Temple shall continue a 1335. yeares, which number of daies Daniel hath, c. 12. 12. But
the grosse blindnes of these Rabbins is euident to all the world: for since the last and finall
desolation of the Iewes Temple by the Romanes, there are past aboue a 1500. yeares. 2.
<hi>Osiander</hi> applying this prophecie to the Turke, by three yeares and an halfe, which contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
in his estimate a 1178. daies (but it commeth to a 1278. daies) vnderstandeth so many
yeares from the first rising of Mahomet in the yeare 613. so long he thinketh the Turkish
tyrannie shall rage: but it is not necessarie, that all the halfe time should be fulfilled: it suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
that the tearme exceede somewhat a thousand yeares. But this can not hang together,
that if the account be of so many yeares, an hundred or two should be cut off from the rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning,
for this were to make the prophecies very vncerten.</p>
                        <p>3. Now some precisely here would haue vnderstood three yeares and an halfe, which
time they limit for the tyrannie of Antichrist in the ende of the world, <hi>Hierom. Lyran. Hug.</hi>
But this is an vncerten and vnprobable opinion, that Antichrist shall raigne iust three yeares
and an halfe before the comming of Christ: for, 1. then it might be gessed at what time
Christ should come to iudgement, if we may come so neare as within 3. yeares and an halfe.
2. S. <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth that the Romane Empire onely letted the comming of Antichrist, 2.
Thess. 2. 7. which beeing long since dissolued, the Empire beeing translated to Germanie,
and the name thereof onely left, Antichrist must be alreadie reuealed to the world.</p>
                        <p>4. The historicall sense then is, that the very time is here described how long <hi>Antiochus</hi>

as the Apostle saith, Apoc. 1. 6. <hi>He hath made vs Kings and Priests to God euen his father:</hi>
As also through Christ his members are made partakers of his euerlasting kingdome: as
our blessed Sauiour saith, Luk. 12. 32. <hi>Feare not litle flocke, it is your Fathers will to giue you
a kingdome.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. Here then that cauill of the Iewes may easily be remooued: who by this would ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
because the holy people are here mentioned, to whome this kingdome is giuen: that by
the Sonne of man, vers. 14. the Messiah is not vnderstood, but the whole posteritie of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,
and so likewise here: But whereas the Prophet saw one as the <hi>sonne of man,</hi> that can
not be applied to Abrahams posteritie, who could not be said to <hi>be as man:</hi> they were then
men beeing and existing: but Christ is said to be as the Sonne of man, because he was not yet
incarnate: this vision was <hi>praeludium incarnationis, &amp;c.</hi> a forewarning of his incarnation. So
then v. 14. the author and foundation of this spirituall kingdome which is giuen vnto the
Church is signified: for vnlesse Christ did sit at the right hand of God, and had all power gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vnto him, the Church should haue no kingdome at all. <hi>Calvin.</hi>

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:18834:123"/>
an earthly and terrene kingdome, <hi>the kingdome vnder the whole heauen is giuen vnto them:</hi>
for this ignorant Rabbin maketh a difference betweene <hi>beeing in the earth, and of the earth:</hi>
the spirituall kingdome of Christ is in the world, though it be not of the world, Ioh. 18. 36.</p>

some that minister in beeing sent abroad into the world to dispatch the affaires com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
vnto them; other stand by as assistants, not beeing sent forth as the other, but they
attend to know the will of God, and to giue direction vnto the ministring spirits. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they assigne the foure higher orders which are <hi>Soraphim, Cherubim, Thrones, Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
to the Angels assistant, and the fiue inferiour, <hi>Angels, Arkangels, Vertues, Powers, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities,</hi>

spirits is greatest, <hi>lib. 17. moral. c. 9. Dyenisius Areopagita,</hi> cited by <hi>Pererius,</hi> is of

                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. Here is no distinction of the offices of diuers sorts of Angels, but onely a
description of their office and ministerie: they stood before the Lord to minister: for so is
this phrase of standing vsed, c. 1. 19. <hi>They stood before the king:</hi> and the Apostle saith, <hi>Are

words following, <hi>sent forth to minister.</hi> Then all the Angels are sent forth to minister, as it
pleaseth God to employ them: they doe not stand still before the Lord as informers of the
rest. 2. This difference then of Angels, some ministring, some assistant, beeing taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
the other question is superflous, which should exceede the other in number. 3. And
concerning those nine orders of Angels, it is but a curious conceit: those seuerall names doe
shew, that there are degrees, and diuersitie of gifts among the Angels, but so many distinct
orders can not thereupon be granted. See more hereof, <hi>Synops. Centur. 2. err.</hi> 1.</p>

would haue giuen by Christs diuine nature to his humanitie: it is euident out of the text,
that it was giuen by the Auncient of daies vnto the Sonne of man. 3. And because in the
text it is called an euerlasting dominion, they hereby vnderstand that dominion, which was
without beginning, and shall be without ende: whereas this dominion giuen vnto Christ
God and man, had a beginning with his incarnation, but shall haue no ende: and this is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,

which is finite, can not be capable of that which is infinite: the humane nature then of

then spirituall things: as in making warre, in taking vpon him to depose and set vp
kings, and to dispose of their kingdomes. 2. and though he challenge to himselfe the chiefe
stroke in the censures of the Church, as in suspending, excommunicating, he vseth them one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the augmentation of his temporall dominion: he intendeth not thereby mens saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
3. So in effect, though vnder an other colour, the Pope exerciseth the Imperiall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
as beeing risen vp out of the ruines of the old Empire: as it is saide in the Reuelation, c.
13. 12. <hi>he did all that the first beast could doe before him.</hi>

                           <hi>Contr.</hi> This appeareth to be false out of the text. 1. these ten kings must beare rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the Saints before the comming of the Messiah, and the erection of the fift kingdome, v.
25. they shall consume the Saints. 2. their kingdome must be destroied before Christ
come, v. 11. 3. after the destruction of them, the kingdome of Christ must be set vp tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
the world (which was by the preaching of the Gospel:) but this is done alreadie.</p>
                        <p>2. He saith, that the little horne is Antichrist, which should come before the ende of the
world.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contr.</hi> This also is confuted by the same reasons. 1. this horne is one of the ten kings,
which should beare rule ouer the Saints, v. 25. which then were vnderstood to be the Iewes
the people of God. 2. this horne must be destroied before the kingdome of Christ be ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
v. 11. 3. this horne was <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> as is before shewed, who prefigured
and shadowed forth Antichrist.</p>
                        <p>3. He saith, that this little horne shall arise from the nation of the Iewes. <hi>Contr.</hi> It ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
among the other hornes, which were interpreted to be kings of the fourth beast and
Monarchie, therefore not from the Iewes.</p>
                        <p>4. He addeth, that by fraud and deceit he shall obtaine the kingdome of the Iewes. <hi>Cont.</hi>
But the text sheweth, v. 21. that he shall make warre against the Saints: he shall then ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
them by force rather then fraud.</p>
                        <p>5. Further he saith that this little horne, which he taketh for Antichrist, shall ouercome
three kings of Lybia, Egypt, Aethiopia. <hi>Contr.</hi> It is euident in the text, v. 8. that the three
kings which shall be subdued, shall be out of one and the same kingdome, v. 22. 24. <hi>the tenne
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:18834:125"/>
hornes out of this kingdome are tenne kings.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>6. Likewise he saith, that this horne shall subdue also the other seuen, after it hath ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the three. <hi>Contra.</hi> But no such thing is affirmed in the text: 2. neither can it be so,
seeing these tenne kings are to succeede one an other, the tenth and the last could not rise vp
at the same time with the other tenne.</p>
                        <p>7. An other of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> positions is, that this Antichrist should raigne but 3. yeares
and an halfe, v. 25. <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. This was literally and historically fulfilled in <hi>Antiochus E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphanes,</hi>
as is before shewed. 2. Antichrist which was to come into the world, must rise
immediatly after the dissolution of the Romane Empire, which onely letted while it stood,
the manifesting and appearing of Antichrist, 2. Thess. 2. 4. Therefore the Romane Empire
beeing now long since dissolued, Antichrist hath bin a good while manifested in the world.</p>

                     <p>IN this Chapter is set forth, 1. a vision of the Persian and Grecian Monarchie, to v. 15.
2. the interpretation thereof, thence to the ende.</p>
                     <p>In the first we are to consider, 1. the circumstances of the vision, both the time,
when this vision was shewed, the person to whome, and the place where, v. 1. 2. 2. the
substance of the vision, to v. 15. which consisteth of three parts, set forth vnder the resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of a ramme, a goate, and a little horne which grew out of one of the foure hornes of
the goate.</p>
                     <p>1. The ramme is described by his beginning, his progresse, his ende. In the beginning
these things are expressed, 1. the place, where this ramme appeared, by a riuer. 2. the
parts, it had two hornes, which are set forth, 1. simply, by the adiunct of their height, 2.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:18834:126"/>
comparatiuely, with relation one to the other, the one was highest, and last in time, v. 3. In
the progresse it is shewed how he preuailed, both by the place, he pushed into all quarters,
and by the effects, none could withstand him, v. 4. The ende of this beast is shewed in the
description of the goate following.</p>
                     <p>2. The goate is described, 1. generally, by the place, he came from the West, the effects,
he went ouer the earth: the qualitie, he went swiftly not touching the ground. 2. particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
by the horne: which is set forth, 1. by the beginning, it came vp betweene the eyes.
2. the progresse and successe, in running vpon the ramme, and ouercomming him, tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
vpon him, v. 7, 8. 3. the ende, this horne was suddenly broken, and foure came vp in
the stead thereof, v. 8.</p>
                     <p>3. The little horne is described by the effects, which are three: 1. his attempts against
the nations in the world, v. 9. 2. against the Church, called the host of heauen, v. 10. 3. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God himselfe: where 1. the effects are rehearsed to be three, against the sacrifice, the
Sanctuarie, v. 11. the truth, v. 12. 2. the time is declared, how long, which is expressed by
way of question, (where is shewed, who asked, of whome, and what, v. 12.) and answer,
v. 14.</p>
                     <p>Then followeth the second part, containing the exposition of this vision: where are set
forth, 1. the preparation, v. 15. to 18. 2. the exposition it selfe, to v. 26. 3. the effects,
which it wrought, v. 27.</p>
                     <p>1. In the preparation are to be considered, 1. the persons expounding: the principall,
one like a man, the lesse principall Gabriel, to whome the other spake, that he should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
the vision. 2. the person, to whome the vision is shewed: how he was affected with
feare, v. 17. and how he was comforted both by the voice, and by the gesture of the Angel
that touched him.</p>
                     <p>2. The exposition is generall, v. 19. then particular, 1. of the ramme, v. 20. 2. of the goat,
21. with the foure hornes, 22. 3. of the little horne: 1. his beginning, v. 23. his progresse,
preuailing, and prospering, set forth by the effects: see the particulars, qu. 32. his ende, <hi>he
shall be broken downe without hand,</hi> v. 25.</p>
                     <p>3. Then followeth the effect, Daniels feare, v. 27. after the Angel had summed and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied

                     <p>1. In the third yeare of the raigne of Belshatzer the king, there appeared a vision vnto
me, <hi>euen</hi> me Daniel, after <hi>that,</hi> which appeared vnto me in the beginning. <hi>B. (at the first.
G.</hi>)</p>
                     <p>2 I saw in a vision, (or <hi>I looked to the vision, I.</hi>) and so it was, that as I saw it, I was at
Shushan in the palace (<hi>in the towne or castle. L. V.</hi> S. <hi>in the chiefe citie. A. the first rather</hi>)
which is in the Prouince (not <hi>the citie. L.</hi>) of Elam, and me thought (<hi>I saw. H.</hi>) in the vision,
that I was by the riuer (not <hi>gate. L.</hi> S. <hi>vbal signifieth a riuer</hi>) of Vlai (not, <hi>of the court.</hi> S.)</p>
                     <p>3 Then I lift vp mine eyes, and beheld one ramme standing before the riuer (<hi>before Vbal.</hi>
S. <hi>but it is no proper name</hi>) which had two hornes (<hi>hornes. L.</hi> S. <hi>but it is in the dual number</hi>)
and these two hornes <hi>were</hi> high: but one was higher then an other (<hi>the second. H.</hi>) and the
highest came vp Last.</p>
                     <p>4 I saw the ramme pushing against the West, (<hi>the sea. H.</hi> S.) and against the North, and
against the South, so that no beasts might stand before him, (<hi>withstand him. I.</hi>) nor any could
deliuer out of his hand (not, <hi>nor could deliuer out of his hand, G. B. L. as referring it to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
clause, that the beast could not deliuer out of his hand: for the word (deliuering, matzil) is
in the singular</hi>) but he did as him lifted (<hi>according to his will. H.</hi>) and became great.</p>
                     <p>5 And as I considered, behold an hee goat <hi>B. (a kid of the goates, H. that is, a young lustie
goate</hi>) came from the West ouer the whole earth, and touched not the ground (<hi>and no man
touched him in the earth. I. but the first is better to shew the celeritie of this praunsing and
conquering goate</hi>) and this goate had a notable horne <hi>I. L. an horne that appeared. B. G. an
horne of vision.</hi> H. betweene his eyes.</p>
                     <p>6 And he came vnto the ramme, that had the two hornes, whome I had seene standing
by the riuer, (not <hi>before the gate. L. or before Vbal.</hi> S.) and ranne vnto him in his fierce rage
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:18834:126"/>
(<hi>rage with might. H.</hi>)</p>
                     <p>7 And I saw him come neare vnto the ramme, and beeing mooued (<hi>moouing himselfe.
H.</hi>) against him, he smote the ramme, and brake his two hornes: and there was no power in
the ramme to stand against him, but he cast him downe to the ground, and trampled on him,
and there was none that could deliuer the ramme out of his power (<hi>hand. H.</hi>)</p>
                     <p>8 Therefore the goat (<hi>kid of the goates. H.</hi>) waxed exceeding great, and when he was at
the strongest, his great horne was broken, &amp; there grew vp for it foure notable ones, <hi>B. (that
appeared. G.</hi>) toward the foure winds of heauen.</p>
                     <p>9 And out of one of them came forth a little (not <hi>a strong.</hi> S.) horne, which waxed very
great toward the South, and toward the East, and toward the pleasant land. (<hi>against the
strength. L. tebi, signifieth delectable. pleasant, and thereby is meant Iudea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>10 And it extolled it selfe <hi>I. L.</hi> S. (<hi>grew vp. B. G. extended it selfe. V.</hi>) against the hoast of
heauen, and cast downe to the earth <hi>some</hi> of the hoast, and of the starres, and trampled on
them.</p>
                     <p>11 And it extolled it selfe (<hi>or magnified</hi>) euen vnto the prince (<hi>against the prince. G.</hi>) of
the host: for from him (<hi>from whome. B. G.</hi>) was taken away the daily <hi>sacrifice,</hi> and the place
of the Sanctuarie was cast downe.</p>
                     <p>12 And the host was deliuered vp to sinne against the daily <hi>sacrifice I. V.</hi> (better then
<hi>power was giuen vnto it ouer the daily sacrifice for the iniquitie. L.</hi> or <hi>a time shall be giuen him
ouer the daily sacrifice for iniquitie. G. and so Mercer. in c. 7. Iob. v. 1. but the word (tzaba) must

                     <p>13 Then I heard one of the Saints speaking, for one of the Saints spoke vnto <hi>phelmoni,</hi>
S. <hi>Br. B.</hi> (that is, <hi>to an excellent one. V. to one that hath secret things in account or number. I.
to a certaine one. G. L. the Hebrew word is better ioyned, because of the ambiguous significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

(<hi>that is, so many daies</hi>) then shall the Sanctuarie be restored (<hi>clensed. B. G. L.</hi> S. <hi>be iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
H.</hi>)</p>
                     <p>15 Now so it was (<hi>B. G. det.</hi>) when I Daniel had seene the vision, and sought for the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
that behold there stood before me, as the similitude (<hi>sight or shew. H.</hi>) of a
man.</p>
                     <p>16 And I heard a mans voice betweene Vlai (that is, <hi>betweene the banks of that riuer</hi>)
which called and said, Gabriel, make this man to vnderstand the vision.</p>
                     <p>17 So he came, where I stood: and when he came I was afraid, and fell vpon my face:
then he said vnto me, Vnderstand, O sonne of man: for in the limited time (not <hi>in the end af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the captiuitie. V. the sense rather then the words,</hi> nor <hi>in the last times. G. time of the end. H.
which is called</hi> (v. 19. <hi>moghed ketz) the appointed time of the ende) shall be</hi> the vision.</p>
                     <p>18 Now as he was speaking vnto me, I was <hi>as</hi> in a slumber (better then <hi>sleepe. G.) falling</hi>
on my face to the ground: but he touched me, and set me vp in my place.</p>
                     <p>19 And he said, Behold, I will shew thee, what shall be in the last wrath (or <hi>vnto the last

shewed vnto men in a traunce, when they are waking, as that vision of the foure cornered

expressed, when the vision is reuealed by dreame, <hi>Osiand. Oecolampadius</hi> addeth this

                        <p>1. <hi>Dyonisius Carthusianus</hi> is of opinion, that this is an inexplicable question, how Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel
at this time could be at <hi>Shushan,</hi> which was the chiefe seate of the kings of Persia. 2.
Some doe make it indifferent, whether Daniel were here corporally, or in vision onely, <hi>Bul.</hi>
But the obiections which afterward followe doe shewe that either of these cannot be indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
held. 3. <hi>Pererius</hi> and <hi>Pintus</hi> following the Latine text, resolue that Daniel was
there corporally, and that it is like the prouince <hi>Susiana</hi> at this time belonged vnto Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea:
but the text saith otherwise, that it was in the prouince of <hi>Elam,</hi> which was in Persia:
<hi>Iosephus</hi> hath the like opinion, that Daniel beeing at <hi>Susa,</hi> with some of his companions
went into the field, and there suddenly rose a great earthquake, which scattered his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
from him, and he was left alone, and then sawe this vision of the ramme and the goat:
But no such thing is expressed in the text, and therefore this report of <hi>Iosephus</hi> hath no
ground.</p>
                        <p>4. It remaineth then, that Daniel was in the palace of <hi>Shushan,</hi> onely in vision: as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
c. 10. 4. he was beside the great riuer <hi>Hiddekell:</hi> corporally Daniel was not there vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
these reasons. 1. because Daniel could not goe whether he would beeing a captiue, and
therefore it is not like he could be suffered to be in his enemies countrey. 2. he was by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legeance
bound to the king of Babel, and by Gods ordinance was to serue him, till the years
of captiuitie were expired, Ierem. 27. 7. 3. Daniel was in Babylon at the taking thereof
by <hi>Darius,</hi> it is not like that he could be permitted to come and go to the professed enemies
of the Chaldeans. 4. And that he nameth the third yeare of <hi>Belshazar,</hi> it is euident he was

                        <p>1. It is here said to be situate in the region or prouince of Elam: <hi>Hierome</hi> readeth, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

they come, that is from the chiefe citie: But it is here taken for a prouince: for how could
one citie be said to be within another. 2. <hi>Hierome</hi> further affirmeth, that this <hi>Susan</hi> was the

chiefe citie of the Medes, <hi>Iudith</hi> 1. 1. but <hi>Sushan</hi> was the chiefe citie of Persia: <hi>Hierome</hi>
also is in the same error: for he saith that Daniel built that great tower at <hi>Susan,</hi> where the
kings of the Medes and Persians were buried: whereas <hi>Iosephus</hi> saith he built it at <hi>Ecbatane</hi>
in Media, who in the same place euidently distinguisheth betweene <hi>Ecbatane</hi> and <hi>Susan.</hi>
making them two diuerse cities, <hi>Iosephus, lib. 10. cap.</hi> 12. So that either <hi>Hieromes</hi> memorie

the pillars were of gold, the roofe or sealing set forth with glistering starres: which goodly

                        <p>1. It is the manner of the Prophets, in their seuerall visions to expresse their names, as
Isay. 2. 1. and 6. 1. so also Ierem. c. 1. 1. c. 2. 1. and in diuerse other places: as Daniel in
this place saith, <hi>a vision appeared vnto me, euen vnto me Daniel,</hi> and the reason is, because the
truth of such prophesies and visions dependeth vpon the credit of those Prophets, to whome
they were onely reuealed: but it is otherwise in matters of historie, where the author need
not insert his owne name, seeing the credit of histories relyeth not vpon the authoritie of
the writer, but vpon the euidence and truth of the things themselues. 2. Therefore that is a
weake exception, which <hi>Dyonisius</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> taketh to the booke of the Reuelation,
that it was not written by Iohn the Euangelist, but by some other, because the Euangelist
verie sparingly nameth himselfe in the gospel: and when he doth so, he describeth himselfe
in the third person, <hi>the disciple whom Iesus loued:</hi> for as is before shewed, there is great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

it was fit the Euangelist should expresse his name for the credit of those visions, as the other

                        <head>Quest. 9. Why the kings of Persia are compared to
a ramme, v. 3.</head>
                        <p>There are three parts of this description. 1. from the similitude or comparison: they are
likened to a ramme. 2. by the parts, the two hornes. 3. by the effects, their preuayling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the West, North, and South.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the first, there are diuerse opinions, why the Persian Monarchie should be
resembled to a ramme. 1. <hi>Theodoret</hi> alleadgeth this reason, <hi>sicut aries sua lana grauatur,</hi> as
a ramme is loaded with his fleece, and at the length is killed for his flesh and fleice: so the
Persian Monarchie abounding in wealth, at length became a prey: But the <hi>Persians</hi> are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to a ramme in their flourishing and prosperous state, when as yet they rather preyed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
then were a prey vnto any. 2. <hi>Lyranus</hi> from the Hebrewes thinketh the kingdome of
the Medes to be expressed by a ramme, a gentle beast, <hi>quia non multum erat infestum Iudae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is,</hi>
because it was not much troublesome to the Iewes. But hereby the kingdome not of the
Medes onely, but of the Persians is signified, who were grieuous to the people of God. 3.
<hi>Rupertus</hi> to the same purpose saith, the kings of Persia were as rammes, <hi>quia lanis suis, id
est, opibus, eundem populum fouit, &amp;c,</hi> because with their riches as with wool, they cherished
the same people of the Iewes: But the most of the Persian kings, though some were more
equall, did suffer the Iewes to be pilled and polled. 4. <hi>Calvin</hi> yeeldeth this reason, we
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:18834:128"/>
knowe, <hi>quam ignobile fuerit Persarum exordium,</hi> how base and meane the beginning of
the Persians was. 5. But that other reason of <hi>Calvin</hi> better satisfieth, that here the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of <hi>Persia</hi> is set forth comparatiuely, as hauing relation to the kingdome of Grecia,
likened to a goate, <hi>quia multo fuit agilior, &amp; origo obscurior,</hi> because his agilitie was grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and his beginning more obscure, <hi>Calvin.</hi> And the ramme bringeth a great companie

of Persia, these two hornes, whereof the latter was the greater: for <hi>Cyrus</hi> grewe to be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then <hi>Darius. 2. Theodoret</hi> expoundeth these two hornes to be two families of the Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
kings, the one of Cyrus, which was extinguished in <hi>Cambyses</hi> his sonne, the other of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius
Hystaspis:</hi> But neither of these opinions can stand: for the goat fighting with this ram,
brake his two hornes: <hi>Alexander</hi> ouercame <hi>Darius,</hi> long after the time of the first <hi>Darius</hi>
and <hi>Cyrus;</hi> these then could not be the two hornes: neither was this last Darius of either of

<hi>Ochus</hi> his brother. 3. Wherefore by these two hornes are better vnderstood the two king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
of the Medes and Persians, this grewe to be the greater in power, though the other
were the more auncient: thus the Angel expoundeth afterward, v. 20. these two hornes

                        <p>1. <hi>Alexander</hi> encountred <hi>Darius</hi> forces in three great battels, first at <hi>Granicum</hi> where
with 32000. footemen, and 4050. horsemen, he ouercame 600000. Persians. After that
<hi>Alexander</hi> discomfited Darius host at <hi>Issum</hi> in Cilicia, consisting of 300000. footemen, and
an 100000. horsmen, in which battel there were slain 80000. footemen, &amp; 10000. horsmen,
and 40. thousand taken prisoners, among the which were Darius wife, his sister, and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
The third &amp; last battel was at <hi>Alexanders</hi> returne out of Egypt, where he built the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
citie <hi>Alexandria,</hi> when at <hi>Arbela, Darius</hi> met him with 400000. footemen, and
an 100000. horsemen, where the power of Persia was fully ouerthrowne: and <hi>Darius</hi> was
slaine by <hi>Bessus</hi> one of his owne captaines, whom <hi>Alexander</hi> for that fact commanded to
be rent asunder, beeing tied to the toppes of trees, <hi>Orosius lib. 3. c.</hi> 16. 17.</p>
                        <p>2. So <hi>Alexander</hi> broke the two hornes of the ramme, that is, ouercame the power of
the Medes and Persians: first at <hi>Issum</hi> he subdued the Persian forces, then in the last battle he
conquered the Medes with other Northerne nations, as the <hi>Caspians, Iberians, Albanians,</hi>

thereby is shewed, that there was no meanes, by force or other to helpe Darius: for in these
3. battels Darius brought not lesse then 15. hundred thousand against <hi>Alexander,</hi> and yet
it auayled him nothing: Darius also attempted <hi>Alexander</hi> with promise of great gifts, and
of part of the kingdome, and the mariage of his daughter: But <hi>Alexander</hi> would accept of

                        <p>3. The manner of his death some thinke was by poison: but the most agree that he died
of a surfet: he feasted at a Physitians house a Thessalian, one of his friends, and continued
all the next day quaffing and drinking vnto midnight, and thorough this distemperature he
fell into a burning feuer, and after fewe dayes died at Babylon, and had no time to returne

parted his kingdome among his seruants, while he was yet aliue, 1. Macchab. 1. 7. But this

the Apochryphall storie of the Macchabees, thus helpeth the matter, that <hi>Alexander</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

whom the rest of the captaines at the perswasion of <hi>Aristonus</hi> did yeeld the chiefe domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and so in that by his authoritie the fowre kingdomes were diuided to the rest, it was in

But this agreeth not with the true historie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for after <hi>Alexanders</hi> death, not <hi>Perdiccas,</hi> but
<hi>Arideus</hi> the brother of <hi>Alexander</hi> succeeded, and <hi>Perdiccas</hi> was but viceroy: neither was
there any peaceable diuision of the kingdom, but after much contention and bloody warres,

Alexanders</hi> wife had brought forth <hi>Alexander</hi> his sonne, and then <hi>Philistio</hi> was protector

                        <p>Three effects are described. 1. his attempts against other nations. 2. his violence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the people of God. 3. his blasphemie and profanenesse against God himselfe.</p>
                        <p>1. He attempted much against the South, namely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> against Egypt, vpon this occasion:
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:18834:130"/>
                           <hi>Ptolomeus Epiphanes</hi> married <hi>Cleopatra</hi> daughter vnto <hi>Antiochus</hi> the great, sister vnto this
<hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> by whom he had <hi>Ptolome Philometor,</hi> who being a child, <hi>Antiochus</hi>
tooke vpon him the tuition of him and his realme: but vnder that colour his meaning was to
hold the kingdome of Egypt to himselfe: Then the Egyptians craued helpe of the Romanes,
who sent <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>ius Popilius,</hi> who discharged Antiochus out of Egypt, making a circle with his
rod at his feete, requiring Antiochus present answer before he went any further.</p>
                        <p>2. He raged also against the people of God the Iewes, whose countrey is called the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
land, because of the knowledge and worship of God, as it is in that sense called the ioy
of the whole earth, Psal. 48. 2. In two expeditions which he made against Egypt, in both
of his returnes from thence he inuaded Ierusalem, and put the Iewes to the sword. At the
first time he was receiued by <hi>Iason</hi> the high Priest, and in his second returne by wicked
<hi>Menelaus:</hi> Thus he raged against the host of heauen, the people of God, who are as the
Lords host militant here in earth: and he cast down some of the starres to the ground, which
some vnderstand generally to be the people of the Iewes, <hi>Hugo.</hi> some the chiefe and famous
men, <hi>Cal. Polan.</hi> But rather by starres are vnderstood the excellent professors of the Church,
whom he caused some to forsake their faith, some to be tormented, as the mother with her
7. sonnes, 2. Macc. 2. 7. thus the casting down of the stars is vnderstood, Apoc. 12. 4. <hi>Bulling.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. Then followeth the third effect, his prophanesse and irreligion against God, who is
called the prince of the host of his Church, hereof there are fowre wicked and vile fruites. 1.
the daily sacrifices should be taken away, with other ceremonies of religion, the Sabbaths
violated, Gods seruice and worship intermitted. 2. The Sanctuarie was defiled, and the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable
Idol of <hi>Iupiter Olympus</hi> set vp in the place of the worship of God. 3. many of
the Iewes reuolted from the faith, and so the <hi>armie,</hi> that is the Church militant was betrayed
into the hands of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> v. 12. 4. he cast downe the truth, that is destroyed the lawe,
defacing and burning the bookes of the law, 1. Macchab. 1. 59. <hi>Bulling.</hi>

                        <p>There are diuerse readings of this verse. 1. Some translate the word, <hi>tzeba, time,</hi> thus
reading, <hi>a time shall be giuen ouer the daylie sacrifice for the iniquitie, Calv. Mercer. in Iob.</hi>
7. v. 1. <hi>Genev.</hi> But seeing the same word <hi>tzeba</hi> is taken for an host or armie, v. 10. it is not
conuenient to alter the signification here. 2. Some other reade, <hi>robur ei datum est, &amp;c.</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
was giuen him against the dayly sacrifice, &amp;c. so the <hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>Perer. Pint. Pap. Osiand.</hi>
but this reading likewise is refused vpon the former reason, because the same word is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
taken before. 3. It remaineth then that this is the true sense and reading: <hi>the host was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vp with the dayly sacrifice (Bul. Vat.) or against the daily sacrifice, I. Pol. by iniquitie or
treachery.</hi> 4. This defection, treacherie, or iniquity, some vnderstand generally of the Iewes &amp;

and defiling of the seruice and worship of God) committed against the daily sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
for the which they were worthily deliuered vp, <hi>Vatab.</hi> But here seemeth to be speciall
relation to the treacherie of the Priests, by whome the citie and temple was betraied, as first
by Iason, afterward by Menelaus, who buying the high Priests place for money, neglected
the Temple and the seruice thereof, transgressed the lawes, and preferred the games and
plaies of the Gentiles, as is more at large declared, 2. Macch. 4.</p>

                        <p>1. This whom Daniel calleth one of the Saints, was no doubt one of the Angels, and most
like to be the Angel Gabriel, because he is bidden afterward by name to cause Daniel to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the vision, <hi>Bulling.</hi> 2. But concerning the other, who is called <hi>Palmoni,</hi> vnto whom
the Angel spake, some questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is who it should be: <hi>Perer.</hi> and <hi>Pintus</hi> do suppose it was some
superiour Angel: and thereupon <hi>Pererius</hi> would ground his speculatiue conceit of the Hier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archie
of Angels, that some are inferiour and ministring spirits, some are superiour and giue
direction vnto the other. 3. But this great Angel, called <hi>Palmoni,</hi> was (no doubt) Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
the Prince of the Angels: for so he is called, <hi>Isay. 9. 7. peleh,</hi> wonderfull, whence this
name <hi>Palmoni</hi> is deriued, <hi>Cal. Bulling.</hi> 4. Now this Angel that asked the question, did it not
of any curiositie, as the disciples enquired of Christ, Act. 1. and therefore are reprooued, but
the Angel for the instruction of Daniel, for the common good of the Church, desireth to
knowe this secret.</p>

Ierusalem in the 143. yeare, 1. Mac. 1. 21. this teame must not take beginning after that: and
seeing also that all this desolation is prophesied to happen vnder Antiochus Epiphanes, who
was this little horne, this tearme must not be extended after the death of Antiochus, who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the 149. yeare, 1. Mac. 6. 16.</p>
                        <p>2. Some do begin this tearme in the 143. yeare, when Antiochus went proudly into the

4. <hi>Iunius,</hi> whom <hi>Polanus</hi> followeth, beginneth this time in the 142. yeare, the sixt
moneth, and 6. day: and so the full summe of 6. yeares, 3. moneths, and 20. dayes, will
come out in the 148. yeare, in the ninth moneth, the 25. day. He beginneth the reckoning
of this desolation of Ierusalem, when <hi>Menclaus</hi> with other wicked men, first obtained li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
of the king to followe the ordinances of the heathen, 1. Mac. 1. 14. and 2. Mac. 4. 25.
And this seemeth to be the best account: for though it cannot be precisely gathered out of
the storie of the Macchabees, when this tearme of a 2300. yeares beganne, it must haue a
perfect ende at the cleansing of the Sanctuarie, which was in the 148. yeare, on the 25.
day of the ninth moneth <hi>Chisleu: Pererius</hi> answereth, that it is not necessarie to vnderstand
that this cleansing of the Sanctuarie should be in the verie ende, <hi>sed prope finem,</hi> but toward
the ende: But the contrarie is euident out of the text, that after the 2300. dayes, <hi>then shall
the Sanctuarie be cleansed:</hi> But they which beginne the sixe yeares in the 143. yeare, cannot
ende this tearme at such time as the Sanctuarie was cleansed, but extend it further.</p>
                        <p>5. Some, as <hi>Pererius</hi> noteth, to make this tearme ende iust at the cleansing of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuarie,
doe read, a 2200. dayes: but this is an euident controlling of the text, which spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of a 2300. dayes.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi>Pappus</hi> indifferently summeth these dayes, either from the first spoyling of the citie, in
the 143. yeare, and so they shall ende in <hi>Antiochus</hi> death; or from the setting vp of the
abhomination of desolation, in the 145. yeare, in the moneth <hi>Chisleu,</hi> 1. Macchab. 1. 57.
and then they shall ende in the ouerthrowe and subuersion of <hi>Nicanor</hi> and his host, which
was two yeares after Antiochus death: But this beeing a prophetical prediction, must haue a
certaine and definite accomplishment, it cannot indifferently be taken two wayes: I preferre
therefore the fourth interpretation as the best.</p>
                        <p>7. Now whereas c. 7. 25. there are assigned a time, two times, and a part, that is 3. yeares

was in the 42. yeare, as is before shewed; and then followeth <hi>Antiochus</hi> first comming to

yeares must beginne from the second comming of <hi>Antiochus</hi> in the 145. yeare, when he

then the rest, and they had chiefely to doe with the people of God, whom the hystorie
of the Macchabees specially concerneth.</p>
                        <p>3. Further whereas the kingdome of the Seleucians was not in any part of Greece, but
in Syria and Chaldea, yet it is called the kingdome of the Grecians, because the Seleucians
had their beginning from thence, and vsed the language, customes, superstitions of the
Greekes, <hi>Perer.</hi>

                        <p>1. Some doe take this to be an excellent name, common to all Angels: it signifieth the
strength or power of God: but it is euident, Luk. 1. 19. where this Angel Gabriel was sent
to the vigin Marie, that it was the proper name of an Angel, <hi>Iun. commentar.</hi> 2. But <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie</hi>
well noteth that Angels are not called by names in respect of themselues, as though
they could not be discerned, but by their seuerall names, in that celestiall citie where they
enioy the vision of God, <hi>sed cum ad nos aliquid ministraturi veniunt, &amp;c.</hi> but when they
come vnto vs to minister, they doe take their names of their ministerie and office, &amp;c. as
here this Angel is called <hi>Gabriel,</hi> the strength of God, because he was employed in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fense
of the Church against the enemies thereof. 3. But this further must be considered,
that this Angel is not so called, <hi>ab essentiali potentia dei,</hi> from the essentiall power of God,
but of that power which was giuen him to execute the Lords commandement. <hi>Iun.</hi> 4. And
this is the onely name giuen vnto Angels in Scripture: for the name <hi>Michael,</hi> which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
one as God, is ascribed vnto Christ, who is equall vnto God: As for the other names,
<hi>Raphael, Ieremiel, Sammael,</hi> they are but the deuised tearmes of men, inserted in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chryphall
bookes, but not to be found in the Canonicall Scriptures, <hi>Polan. Iun.</hi>

                        <p>1. The Angels of themselues haue no power to infuse vnderstanding into the minde of
man: but he onely which hath created the heart of man, can giue vnto it vnderstanding: And
the Angels themselues cannot vnderstand the secrets and mysteries of God, vnlesse it be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vnto them, as here the Angel called an holy one, enquired of <hi>Palmoni,</hi> which is Christ,
the meaning of this vision, v. 13. 2. yet when it pleaseth God to vse the ministerie of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
they may helpe to make a way for our better vnderstanding, as he which openeth the
windowe, may be said to giue light vnto the house, yet it is the sunne properly that giueth
light: So the Sonne of righteousnesse illuminateth our hearts, the Angels may helpe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
the way, <hi>Polan.</hi> 3. But in this place the Angel doth not by any secret infusion open
Daniels vnderstanding, but by a manifest and cleare interpretation of the vision: and so the

                        <p>4. <hi>Bullinger</hi> here vnderstandeth the ende of the Macedonian kingdome, for so <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus

brought to be a Prouince: But this interpretation agreeth not with the text, which saith, <hi>that

that he meaneth that kingdome out of which this fierce king should come, which was the
kingdome of the Seleucians.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi>Calvin</hi> thus interpreteth, <hi>in the ende of their kingdome,</hi> that is, <hi>vbi ad summum per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenerint,</hi>

1. The time is expressed, <hi>when the iniquities, or defection, or falling away is perfited,</hi> which
some vnderstand generally when the iniquities of the people were encreased, <hi>Lyran. Hugo.</hi>
then God would raise vp one to punish them. Some referre it to the professed enemies of
the Church of God, when they should be multiplied: But there is speciall reference had
to the generall defection and falling away from religion, vnto gentilisme, as is declared, 1.
Macchab. 1. v. 12. v. 43. and c. 2. v. 15. And the ringleaders of this apostasie were <hi>Iason,</hi>
who bought the high Priests place of <hi>Antiochus</hi> for money, and <hi>Menelaus</hi> who by the like
briberie obtayned it, <hi>Iason</hi> beeing expelled: which wicked men procured the Greeke playes
to be set vp in Ierusalem, and sent money to Tyrus for a sacrifice to <hi>Hercules,</hi> and followed
the abhominable fashion of the heathen: as it is more at large shewed. 2. Macchab. 4.</p>
                        <p>2. He is set forth by his adiuncts. 1. he shall be of an hard countenance, that is, of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
face, a shamelesse man. 2. <hi>he shall vnderstand darke sentences,</hi> which some expound
thus, he shall cause by his doings this darke vision to be vnderstood, as beeing fulfilled in
him, <hi>Hugo.</hi> But hereby rather is signified his craft and cunning, he should be most subtile
and politike to contriue his purpose.</p>
                        <p>3. His state is set forth, his power shall be mightie, <hi>but not in his strength:</hi> which some
expound, 1. his strength shall not be like <hi>Alexanders, Genevens.</hi> 2. or <hi>astutior erit quam
potentior,</hi> he shall be more craftie then powerfull: <hi>grassabitur per fraudes,</hi> he shall proceede
by craft, not by strength, <hi>Calvin.</hi> so also <hi>Iun. annot. 3. Hugo</hi> following the <hi>interlin. gloss.</hi>
giueth this sense, <hi>not in his owne strength, but of Gods,</hi> for he could not so haue prospered
vnlesse Gods will had beene so, for the punishment of his people. 4. <hi>not in his owne strength,
sed Satanae virtute,</hi> but by the power of Satan, <hi>gloss. ordinar. ex Gregor.</hi> 5. But the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
rather is this, he seduced others, <hi>quorum viribus abuteretur,</hi> whose power he should a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse
to helpe himselfe: for both he was helped by the treacherie of the high Priests, <hi>Iason,</hi>
and <hi>Menelaus, Bulling.</hi> and he had also the helpe of forren kings, <hi>Eumenes,</hi> and <hi>Attalus,</hi> as
<hi>Appian in Syriacis. Polan.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. His acts and exploits are of two sorts, either against men, or against God himselfe:
Against men. 1. <hi>he shall destroy wonderfully,</hi> which <hi>Hugo</hi> referreth to <hi>Antiochus</hi> obscure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
that he suddenly should rise to so great power: <hi>Oecolampadins</hi> vnderstandeth it of
his wonderfull crueltie, who in three dayes slue 80. thousand in Ierusalem, 40. thousand were
put in bands, and as many sold: But it may more fitly be vnderstood of his deceit and craft,
whereby he wonderfully prospered: for he procured the death of his father <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and
then of his elder brother <hi>Seleucus,</hi> and then defeated also <hi>Seleucus</hi> sonne of the kingdom.
2. <hi>he shall destroy the mightie and holy people, Gregorie</hi> vnderstandeth here, <hi>mente inuictos,</hi>
those which were strong and inuincible in minde, whom he corporally ouercame, as the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the seuen children, and other of the Saints, <hi>Lyran. Hugo</hi> vnderstandeth the Iewes
which were strong and mightie, <hi>auxilio dei,</hi> by the strength of God before: this sheweth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that he should not onely prosper against the people of God, but subdue other strong
nations also, as the Egyptians, with other people, <hi>Calv. Polan.</hi> 3. A third effect is, that
he should so by his policie and craft preuaile, winning some by flatterie and bribes, others by
fraud and deceit, that he should thereby wax wonderfull insolent and proud aboue measure:
in so much,<note place="margin">2. Macchab. 9. 8.</note> as that he should thinke <hi>to command the floods, and to weigh the mountaines in a
ballance. 4. He shall in peace destroy many:</hi> 1. some reade in <hi>copia rerum,</hi> in the abundance of
things: which <hi>Hugo</hi> vnderstandeth of his gifts: <hi>Lyran:</hi> of his power giuen him of God. 2.
but the word <hi>shalvah</hi> signifieth peace: <hi>Calvin</hi> expoundeth, that he shall <hi>per quietem quasi
per ludum,</hi> by peace, and at his ease, and as in sport, without any difficultie preuayle: some
giue this sense, that he shall set vpon men which were in peace, <hi>nihil opinantes,</hi> thinking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
but the meaning is, he shall vnder color and pretense of peace destroy many: for so he
inuaded Egypt vnder pretense to be gardiane to the young king, his nephewe: so he gaue
peaceable words vnto the Iewes, who gaue credit to him, and he entred the citie, and put
them to the sword, 1. Macch. 1. 31, 32. 2. Then followeth his insolencie against God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
<hi>he should stand vp against the prince of princes:</hi> for so he set vp in despight of God the
abhominable idol of <hi>Iupiter Olympus</hi> in the temple.</p>
                        <p>The fift and last part of the description is of his ende: he <hi>shall be broken downe without
hand,</hi> that is of man, he died by the stroke of Gods hand, of a most incurable disease, 2.

concerning the death of Antiochus.</head>
                        <p>There are some differences, which seeme to admit some reasonable satisfaction, but some
other there are, which can not be reconciled.</p>
                        <p>The differences of the first sort are these. 1. whereas the narration of the death of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus
is set forth in three places, 1. Macch. c. 6. 2. Macch. c. 1. and c. 9. in the 1. Macch. c. 6.
v. 1. it is saide, that Antiochus would haue spoiled the rich temple in the citie <hi>Elymais:</hi> and
yet, 2. Macch. c. 9. it is saide to be the citie <hi>Persepolis,</hi> the temple whereof he would haue
spoiled: <hi>Pererius</hi> here answereth, that it was in deede the citie Susa in the Prouince of Ely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mais,
the temple whereof he would haue robbed; which is called <hi>Persepolis</hi> a citie of Persia:
though he confesseth, that there was a citie of that name, but that was destroied by Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
he himselfe, with his captaines beeing drunken, at the instigation of <hi>Thais</hi> his concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine,
set fire vnto it with his owne hands. <hi>Contr.</hi> But a better answer may be found out:
that the words are not to be read, <hi>he heard that Elymais in the countrey of Persia, was a citie
greatly renowned for riches,</hi> as the Latine translatour readeth, whome our English translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
follow: but the Greeke text standeth thus, he heard, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, that there
was in Elymais in the region of Persia, a citie. So Elymais, is not the name of the citie, but of
the countrey which belonged to Persia, where this citie was. And <hi>Persepolis</hi> is knowne to
haue beene the proper name of a citie, which though it had beene destroied by Alexander
aboue an 150. yeares before this, yet it might, and is like in all this time to haue beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
againe.</p>
                        <p>2. Whereas 1. Macch. 6. 5. it is said, that one brought him tidings into Persia, how his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
were discomfited in Iudea: and 2. Macch. 9. 3. it is said the newes was brought him to
<hi>Ecbatane,</hi> which is in Media, not in Persia, Tob. 3. 7. <hi>Pererius</hi> giueth this satisfaction, that
the messenger might first come into Persia, but not finding the king there, he went to Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batane.</p>
                        <p>3. 1. Macch. 6. 4. the Latine translator readeth, <hi>he came againe to Babylon:</hi> but 2. Macch.
9. 28. it is said, he died in a straunge countrey among the mountaines: he could not die in a
straunge countrey beeing at Babylon, for that was his owne countrey. This doubt also may
easily be remooued by amending the translation: the words in the original are, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>,
he was to returne to Babylon, <hi>Iun. Vatab. in animo habuit, &amp;c.</hi> it was in his minde
to returne to Babylon, <hi>Perer.</hi> but the Latine translation is, <hi>reversus est in Babyloniam,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to Babylon: which reading if they will stand vnto, this contradiction can not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled.</p>
                        <p>4. 1. Macch. 6. 8. it is saide, he fell sicke for sorow: but 2. Macch. 9. it is declared how he
was stricken with an incurable disease, that wormes came out of him, and no man could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the stinke of his bodie: <hi>Pererius</hi> also thus reconcileth these places, that both were true,
he might sicken of griefe, and his sicknes was encreased by that filthie disease: so also <hi>Hugo,</hi>
he died <hi>morbo scilicet &amp; tristitia,</hi> both of the disease, and griefe also.</p>
                        <p>These doubts may with some probabilitie be satisfied: but this contradiction can not be
healed, that whereas 1. Macch. c. 6. and 2. Macch. c. 9. Antiochus is reported to haue died
partly of griefe, partly of a strange disease: Now 2. Macc. 1. 16. it is reported, that he with his
armie was slaine with stones in the temple of Nanea, their heads cut off, and throwne out.
To this obiection diuers answers are made, to preserue the credit of this booke.</p>
                        <p>1. Some thinke that this Antiochus slaine in the Temple of Nanea, was not Antiochus
Epiphanes, whose death is mentioned in those two other places: but <hi>Antiochus magnus</hi> the
father of this Antiochus: so <hi>Lyran. Carthusian. Melchior Canus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contr. Bellarmine,</hi> and <hi>Pererius</hi> both doe refuse this answer: for this Antiochus thus
killed, was an enemie to the Iewes, and they reioyced in his fall: but the other <hi>Antiochus</hi>

<pb n="256" facs="tcp:18834:134"/>
himselfe saith, that this Antiochus was called <hi>Triphon,</hi> or Gryphus: in one sentence he
committeth two errors: for this <hi>Tryphon</hi> vsurped the kingdome, whome Antiochus expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:
and Antiochus Gryphus was the 17. king of Syria, whereas <hi>Antiochus pius</hi> was the 15.
<hi>Bulling.</hi> of this opinion, that this was <hi>Antiechus pius</hi> here reported to be slaine, are <hi>Rupert.
lib. 1. de victor. verb. c. 6. Michael Medina, Carolus Sigonius.</hi> But these two arguments make
against this opinion, 1. that <hi>Antiochus pius</hi> had no such ende, but died in battell against
the Parthians, <hi>Iustin. lib. 38. in fine.</hi> 2. Antiochus though there was some variance betweene
him and <hi>Hyrcanus,</hi> yet he spoiled not the citie, but when he besieged it, he gaue them seuen
daies truce at their request, to celebrate the feast of Tabernacles, and beside sent them vessels
of siluer, and vessels of gold, and much incense: and at the length a league was concluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
them. But this Antiochus, that should be put to death in the Temple of Nanea, was
a professed enemie vnto the Iewes, and therefore they reioyce and giue thankes for his
death.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Pererius</hi> deliuereth an other opinion, to the which he subscribeth as probable: that
not Antiochus, but the captaine of his host was killed with stones: <hi>they cast stones as it were
thunder vpon the captaine.</hi> But it is euident, that Antiochus is vnderstood by the captaine,
v. 13. 14. <hi>Albeit the captaine, and they which were with him, seemed inuincible, yet they were
slaine in the Temple of Nanea: for Antiochus, as though he would dwell with her, came thither
to receiue money vnder the title of a dowrie.</hi> It was Antiochus himselfe, that pretended ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
with Nanea, or Diana, as the like is reported of <hi>Tiberius, Nero, Heliogabalus,</hi> that
would make marriages with the goddesses: he therefore came himselfe in person, to receiue
as a dowrie, the treasure of the Temple.</p>
                        <p>4. But <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and <hi>Pererius</hi> likewise doe most approoue this solution, who thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
these words, v. 13. <hi>cecidit in templo Naneae, the captaine with his host fell in the temple
of Nanea:</hi> that is, they were smitten, not slaine. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> giueth instance of the like place,
Gen. 14. 10. <hi>The king of Sodome and Gomorrah fell there, in the slimie pits,</hi> that is, were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited,
they were not killed: for the king of Sodome met Abraham afterward. <hi>Pererius</hi>
obiecteth that place, Dan. c. 11. 30. how the Romanes should come against Antiochus, and
he should be smitten, yet he was not killed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. The word vsed 2. Macchab. 1. 13. is <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, not <hi>they fell,</hi> but <hi>they
were smitten or slaine: concisi sunt,</hi> they were hewen and cut in pieces, as <hi>Vatablus</hi> and <hi>Iunius</hi>
translate. 2. in that place, Gen. 24. 10. it is onely said, <hi>they fell,</hi> but here more is expressed,
they were cut in pieces, v. 16. 3. and in the other place, the word is better translated by
<hi>Vatablus, consternabitur,</hi> he shall be <hi>grieued,</hi> or <hi>terrified,</hi> not <hi>smitten.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>5. This then remaineth to be saide, that this is an vncerten and vntrue report of Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus
death, as that is likewise of the holy fire which was hid, and when Nehemias sent to set
it, they found thicke water in stead of fire. And therefore that other report of Antiochus
death, beeing twice set downe, 1. Macchab. c. 6. and 2. Macchab. c. 9. is to be receiued as the
more probable. <hi>Iun.</hi>

Church with this description of
Antiochus.</head>
                        <p>1. As the apostasie of the Iewes was a forerunner of the tyrannie and persecution of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist:
So when persecution is raised in the Church, many doe fall away: as when <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
fauoured Arrius, and persecuted the orthodoxall professours, <hi>Liberius</hi> the Bishop of
Rome fell away also to Arrianisme. And of late daies when <hi>Charles</hi> the fift made warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Protestant Princes in Germanie, many gospellers either fell to Poperie, or recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the <hi>Interim:</hi> And in England in Queene Maries daies, many forsooke the Gospel, and
turned Papists.</p>
                        <p>2. As Antiochus was of a bold countenance, and full of craft, such were the persecutors
of the Gospel, as <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostata, <hi>Valens</hi> the Emperour, the Duke of <hi>Albanie</hi> in the low
countries.</p>
                        <p>3. As Antiochus encreased by the treacherie of others, that helped him: so it is vsuall for
the enemies of the Gospel to preuaile, if they can by treacherie: as many treasons against
Queene Elizabeth, and our noble Soueraigne that now is, haue beene set forward by some
forren Popish princes.</p>
                        <p>4. Antiochus by flatterie, and vnder colour of peace deceiued many: so did the Duke of

Albania in the lowe countries: and king <hi>Philip</hi> when he intented the inuasion of England,

referring this vision to the last times of their redemption by their Messiah, would
haue it therefore sealed, because the time was long, before it should be fulfilled. 7. But the
reasons why Daniel is commanded to seale vp the vision, were these. 1. that he should not
communicate it vnto the Chaldees, whom it concerned not, or to any other carnall men, or
vnbeleeuers, that would not giue credit vnto it: but that he should conceale it from such:
yet vnto the faithfull he might impart it: As the Prophet Isay saith to the same purpose, 8.

                        <p>1. After that Antiochus (the great) father vnto Antiochus Epiphanes, had beene vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
by Scipio, he was constrained to deliuer ouer vnto the Romanes his sonne Antiochus
to be an hostage, where he continued 14. yeares: and then hearing of his fathers death, wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
his time, and fled secretly from Rome, and tooke vpon him the kingdome of Syria, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

<hi>Demetrius</hi> his sonne.</p>
                        <p>2. Then <hi>Antiochus,</hi> after he was setled in the kingdome, inuaded Egypt, vnder this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
to be tutor vnto the young king Ptolome Philometor his sister Cleopatra her sonne:
he put many to the sword, and subdued many cities: And in his returne, beeing sauoured by
diuers seditious persons in Ierusalem, as by Iason, who had bought the priesthood of him
for money, and wicked Menelaus, who got the Priesthood for himselfe, promising more
money, and put Iason by, 2. Macchab. 4. by this meanes he entred into the citie, robbed and
spoiled the Temple, and put many to the sword: this was in the 143. yeare of the kingdome
of the Greekes, in the 6. yeare of his raigne.</p>
                        <p>3. Then about two yeare after he made a second expedition into Egypt, where he was
commanded to depart by <hi>Popilius</hi> the Embassadour of the Romanes, who making a circle
in the sand with his rod before Antiochus, vrged him to make his present answer, before he
went thence.</p>
                        <p>4. In his second returne he entred Ierusalem againe, and made hauocke of the citie, defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

                        <head>4. Controv. The description of Antiochus agreeth to the
Pope and Antichrist.</head>
                        <p>Although historically this vision of the little horne were fulfilled in Antiochus, yet for as
much as he was a type of Antichrist, all those properties doe fitly agree vnto him also, sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
forth in Antiochus: and so <hi>Gregor. in 40. c. Iob,</hi> and <hi>Lyranus</hi> doe in diuers points
make Antiochus a type of Antichrist, though they doe not take the Romane Bishop to
be he.</p>
                        <p>1. Before Antiochus raged against the people of God, there was a defection and falling
away of many from the faith, to Paganisme: and this is touched, v. 23. <hi>In the ende of their
kingdome, when their rebellions, defections, or falling away shall be perfited:</hi> for so Iason, and
Menelaus, with diuers other of the Iewes forsooke their religion, and followed the Gentile
customes, 1. Macchab. 14. 15. So before Antichrist come, there shall be a departure or apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie,
2. Thess. 2. 3. which shall be a falling away from the faith, as <hi>Ireneus</hi> interpreteth,
<hi>lib. 5. advers. haeres. c.</hi> 21. so also <hi>Primasius, Chrysostome, Oecumen. Lyran.</hi> vpon that place:
which we see is come to passe, that the most part of Christian nations had forsaken the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of the Gospel.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Antiochus</hi> was of an impudent face: so Antichrist shall be <hi>ad omne malum inuerecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi>
vnshamefast to euery euill worke, <hi>Lyran.</hi> which is fulfilled in the Pope: who without all
modestie and shamefastnes, challengeth to be the Vicar of Christ, the head of the Church,
Vniuersall Bishop, and what not.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>His power was great, but not by his owne strength.</hi> Antiochus was assisted by the mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
practises of others, as of <hi>Menelaus:</hi> So the Pope hath encreased by the helpe of others.
Phocas that killed Mauritius the Emperour, first graunted vnto Pope Boniface the 3. to be
called head of the Church: And of late times the French and Spanish kings haue waged bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
for the Pope.</p>
                        <p>4. v. 23. <hi>He shall vnderstand darke sentences,</hi> whereby is vnderstood his craft and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie:
so Antichrist, as <hi>Lyranus</hi> noteth, <hi>callidissimus erit auxilio Diaboli,</hi> shall be most craftie
by the helpe of the deuill: And so the Pope hath bewitched the world with his intoxicate
cuppe of fornications, with deceitfull and subtile doctrines of inuocation of Saints, prayer
for the dead, purgatorie, indulgences, and such like: and he hath also deceiued the world
with lying signes and wonders, as S. Paul prophecieth, 2. Thess. 2. 9.</p>
                        <p>5. Antiochus <hi>should destroy the mightie, and the holy people:</hi> So the Pope hath deposed
kings, and depriued them of their kingdomes: he hath also more persecuted the people of
God, then euer did any of the Pagan Emperours.</p>
                        <p>6. Antiochus is prophecied to waxe great toward the North, toward the south, &amp;c. v. 9.
he should raise vp tumults and warres euery where: So the Popes haue beene the authors
of bloodie warres in euery place almost. Gregorie the 3. and Leo 3. set Italie against the
Emperour: zacharias suborned Pipinus against Childerick king of Fraunce: Adrian 1. set
the French and Lombards together by the eares: Iulius the 2. stirred vp diuers Christian
Princes against the Venetians: Nicolaus the 3. caused the Sicilians to put the French to the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:18834:136"/>
sword: Paulus the 3. raised the Italians and Spaniards against the Germanes: yea, there
haue beene almost no warres betweene Christian Princes, wherein the Pope hath not put
his foule finger.</p>
                        <p>7. Antiochus should thorough peace destroy many: and so did Gregorie the 13. vnder
pretence of peace, in that bloodie mariage at Paris, in the yeare 1572. cause much blood to
be shed.</p>
                        <p>8. Antiochus should stand against the Prince of Princes, God himselfe: so the Pope ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanceth
himselfe against God, in taking vnto himselfe authoritie to dispense with the word
of God: in maintaining doctrines directly opposite to the Scriptures, as idolatrie, inuocation
of Saints, merits, and such like.</p>
                        <p>9. Antiochus should exalt himselfe in his heart, v. 25. so the Pope hath beene so lifted
vp in pride, that he hath set his foote in the necks of Emperours, made them kisse his foote,
and hold his stirrup, and lead his horse.</p>
                        <p>10. Antiochus should be destroyed without hand: so the Lord shall consume Antichrist
with the spirit of his mouth, 2. Thess. 2. 8.</p>

the Prophet Ieremie, that the 70. yeares of captiuitie was accomplished, v. 2. what it
wrought, it mooued him vnto carnest prayer and supplication, v. 3. which is set forth by the

                     <p>15 And now, O Lord our God, which hast brought thy people out of the land of Egypt

                        <p>1. What Darius this was, is handled at large, qu. 1. c. 6. he was not that Darius, in whose
second yeare the Temple beganne to be built, whereof mention is made, Hagg. 1. 1. as <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyrie</hi>
of purpose doth confound them, to disturbe the propheticall historie and computati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of yeares in Daniel: neither was this that <hi>Darius</hi> whome Alexander ouercame, but Dari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
before mentioned, c. 6. who together with <hi>Cyrus</hi> tooke the citie of Babylon.</p>
                        <p>2. This Assuerus the father of Darius, was not that <hi>Assuerus</hi> the husband of Esther, as
<hi>Canus</hi> thinketh, and <hi>Bullinger</hi> seemeth to incline to that opinion: for that Assuerus is also
called Artaxerxes in the booke of Esther, which was the name of the Persian kings after Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus:
And that Assuerus had his palace and princely seat at Sushan, which was not appointed
to be the chiefe citie or seat of the kingdom vntil Cyrus, as <hi>Strabo</hi> thinketh, <hi>l.</hi> 15. or till <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius
Hystaspis,</hi> as <hi>Plin. lib. 6. c. 21. Perer.</hi> But this argument rather ouerthroweth this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that the captiuitie of Babylon was ended, and the people returned before the raigne of
that <hi>Assuerus:</hi> whereas they were at this time in captiuitie still. And further, that <hi>Assuerus</hi>
raigned from India to Ethiopia: but the Chaldean Monarchie yet standing, the Persian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie

Assuerus to be Astyages whose daughter <hi>Mandane</hi> was Cyrus mother: but Astyages is not
found to haue had any sonnes, but onely that daughter, as is shewed before, c. 6. qu. 1. 6.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Pererius</hi> thinketh that <hi>Assuerus,</hi> or <hi>Achashuerus,</hi> was not the proper name of any one
king, but it beeing deriued of <hi>Achash, great,</hi> and <hi>Resh,</hi> an head, was a common name, which
was giuen by the Hebrewes vnto forren Princes that were of great power: And this title is
found giuen vnto three kings, the father of this <hi>Darius,</hi> the husband of Esther, and to that
king, which hindred the building of the Temple, Ezr. 4. who is thought by the most to be
Cambyses the sonne of <hi>Cyrus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contr. Pererius</hi> is here deceiued in many points. 1. he taketh <hi>Assuerus</hi> to be an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
name, where it hath a Persian deriuation, and is deriued of <hi>Achash,</hi> which signifieth a
Prince, <hi>Polan. in c. 6. v.</hi> 1. 2. it is euident, that it was a peculiar name, for otherwise it should
haue beene common to all the Persian kings. 3. the same <hi>Assuerus</hi> mentioned Ezt. 4. 6. is
thought to be the same so much celebrated in the storie of Esther: in both places <hi>Iunius</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
him for <hi>Xerxes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>5. Wherefore the more probable opinion is, that this <hi>Assuerus,</hi> called by the Greeke hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians
<hi>Cyaxares</hi> the first, was father vnto Astyages and this <hi>Darius,</hi> who was called also
<hi>Cyaxares</hi> the second: for there is no great difference in signification betweene <hi>Cyaxares</hi> and
<hi>Achassuerus,</hi> the first beeing deriued of <hi>chu,</hi> and <hi>achash,</hi> both which words signifie a Prince:
and put together, a Prince of Princes, that is, a great Prince: and <hi>Achassuerus</hi> likewise is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued
of the same word, <hi>Achash,</hi> a Prince, <hi>Ioseph. Scallig. lib. 6. de emendat. Polan. in 6. Dan.</hi>

seemeth to giue vnto him eight yeares, <hi>cateches. 12. 4. Severus Sulpitius</hi> thinketh
that Darius raigned 18. yeares, at the same time that Astyages raigned in Media: but that
can not be, for this Darius was also the king of the Medes and Persians, as is euident, c. 6. 5.
<hi>Iosephus Scalliger</hi> giueth vnto Darius 17. yeares, making him the last king of the Chaldeans,
after whome Cyrus succeeded, <hi>lib. 6. de emendat. tempor. 6. Iunius</hi> opinion seemeth to be,
<hi>commentar, in 5. c. v.</hi> 29. that the first yeare of Darius, was the second of Cyrus. 7. <hi>Pereri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
affirmeth that Darius raigned but one yeare, and that <hi>Cyrus</hi> succeeded him in the same
yeare, beeing the 70. yeare of the Iewes captiuitie.</p>
                        <p>8. But the truer opinion is, that Cyrus and Darius raigned ioyntly together, as thinketh
<hi>Calvin:</hi> and that the first of Darius was the first also of Cyrus: for in the first of Cyrus the
word of God spoken by Ieremie concerning the 70. yeares captiuitie was finished, 2. Chro.
36. 22. And so likewise it appeareth in this place, that in the first yeare of Darius, that time
of 70. yeares was expired: the first then of Cyrus and Darius concurred together: for the rest,
it is like that Darius raigned not long, but beeing 62. yeare old, when he tooke the kingdom
vpon him, he might die the same yeare, which was also Cyrus first: see more hereof, c. 6. qu. 3.</p>
                        <p>9. And whereas it is saide, <hi>in one yeare of Darius,</hi> which <hi>Pererius</hi> gesseth to be so called,
because he raigned but one yeare: the reason rather is this, that the word <hi>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>1. He affirmeth, that the Chaldean state was not dissolued in the 70. yeare of the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie,
but rather in the 60. yeare: for from the 8. yeare of Ieconias captiuitie vnto the ende of
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:18834:139"/>
the Chaldean gouernment, are found saith he, by <hi>Iosephus</hi> computation, who therein follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<hi>Berosus,</hi> about 60. yeares: 36. yeares remained after the 8. yeare of Nabuchadnezzers
raigne when the captiuitie beganne, who raigned in all 43. yeares: after Nabuchadnezzer
Euilmerodach 2. yeares, then Niglasar 4. yeares, Labosardach 9. moneths, and Nabonidus,
whome Cyrus ouercame, 17. yeares.</p>
                        <p>2. He thinketh that Cyrus did not take Babylon in the first yeare of his raigne, but many
yeares after when he had vanquished <hi>Cresus</hi> the rich king of Lydia, two yeares after that, as
<hi>Herodotus</hi> writeth, he ouercame the Chaldeans: But <hi>Cresus</hi> was ouercome, as <hi>Eusebius</hi> doth
cast the time, in the 4. yeare of the 57. Olympiad, whereas Cyrus began to raigne in the 1.
yeare of the 53. <hi>Olyampiad.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. The first yeare of Cyrus he would haue concurre with the 46. yeare of the captiuitie,
not with the 70. yeare: for the beginning of Cyrus raigne, as is before shewed, was in the 1.
yeare of the 55. Olympiade: And Babylon was taken in the 2. yeare of the 58. Olympiade,
which was the 14. yeare of Cyrus, and the 60. yeare of the captiuitie.</p>
                        <p>4. A fourth assertion is, that the captiuitie ended in the last yeare of Cyrus, about the 2.
yeare of the 62. <hi>Olympiad,</hi> when as Cyrus had now subdued many countries, which could
not be in the beginning of his raigne: for thus Cyrus saith in his Edict for the returne of the
Iewes, <hi>All the kingdoms of the earth hath the Lord God of heauen giuen vnto me:</hi> And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
it is there called the 1. yeare of Cyrus, that is not to be vnderstood of his raigne, but of the
captiuitie: for so the Iewes began their account of yeares from that time.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. The first position is contrarie to that prophesie of Ieremie, c. 35. 12. <hi>When
the 70. yeares are accomplished, I will visit the king of Babel, &amp;c.</hi> then the 70. and last yeare
of the captiuitie, and the dissolution of the Babylonian state, must fall out together: as for
that computation of <hi>Berosus</hi> of the yeares of the Babylonian kings, it is vncerten: neither
doth <hi>Iosephus</hi> alwaies follow it, who els where ioyneth the last yeare of the captiuitie, with
the first yeare of <hi>Cyrus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Herodotus</hi> is deceiued much in his historie in the order of time, and in the computati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of yeares, as is euident in this one instance; <hi>Nitocris</hi> the mother of <hi>Balshazar,</hi> whome he
calleth <hi>Labynitus</hi> the last king of Babylon, he maketh but fiue generations or descents from
<hi>Semiramis:</hi> which exceedeth not an 165. yeares, counting a generation at 33. yeares, or at
the most 500. yeares, if we giue an 100. yeares to a generation: whereas the most writers are
of opinion, as <hi>Hierome, Eusebius, Orosius, Augustine,</hi> with others, that there were at the least
a 1000. yeares betweene them.</p>
                        <p>3. The two last assertions may euidently be conuinced by the Scripture, which expressely
setteth downe, that the returne of the Iewes, and so the ende of their captiuitie, was in the
first yeare of <hi>Cyrus:</hi> which must be vnderstood of his raigne ouer Chaldea, for he had raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
before in Persia, and <hi>Darius</hi> in Media: he might say all kingdomes were giuen him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he had ouercome the large Empire of Babylon. The Iewes indeede accounted their
owne yeares from such notable deliuerances, as from their going out of Egypt, from their
returne out of Chaldea: but there is no reason so to account the yeares of the raigne of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
kings, neither can any such president be shewed in Scripture.</p>

                        <p>1. The word <hi>generation,</hi> is taken diuersly: sometimes for 7. yeares, as when the Physi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

prescribe that a child should not be let blood till he hath accomplished two generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that is, 14. yeares. <hi>Eusebius</hi> taketh a generation for 20. yeares: <hi>Herodotus</hi> sometime for
the space of 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>. yeares, sometime for 33. yeares: <hi>Diodorus</hi> for 30. yeares: in which sense <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

saith <hi>Nestor</hi> liued three ages, that is 90. yeares: <hi>Dyonisius Halycarnass.</hi> by a generation
vnderstandeth an 100. yeares: and so it is taken in Scripture, Gen. 15. 13. 16. foure generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are expounded to be foure hundred yeares. Beside these diuers acceptions of the word
<hi>generation, Carthusianus</hi> taketh it for the age of a man apt for generation, which is at 14.
yeares: whereof fiue doe make 70. yeares: the first and last are reckoned <hi>exclusive,</hi> exclusiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
as the like instance he giueth in the Euangelists, where Mathew saith Christ was transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:18834:139"/>
after sixe daies, c. 17. Luke saith after eight, exclusiuely: But this is a very forced expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition:
for to what ende should seuen generations be named, if they were onely fiue: neither
can it be shewed out of the Scriptures, that a generation is taken for 14. yeare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>.</p>
                        <p>2. The same <hi>Carthusian</hi> hath an other exposition, that the number of seuen is taken for
perfection, and so by 7. generations he meaneth the perfect periode of a mans life, which is
seauentie yeares: as it is defined, Psal. 90. But this rather should haue beene named one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
then seuen: for one mans life maketh but one generation.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Pererius</hi> hath diuerse answers, by seuen generations he vnderstandeth many: but the
captiuitie lasted not many generations, seeing Daniel sawe the beginning and ende thereof.</p>
                        <p>4. By a generation he vnderstandeth the tearme of 15. yeares, because at that age men
are apt for generation: then 5. of these generations were complete, and two of them the
first and last were but begunne onely.</p>
                        <p>5. Or <hi>Ieremie</hi> speaketh of the captiuitie which beganne with <hi>Iechonias, Baruch</hi> of that
which tooke beginning vnder <hi>Zedekiah:</hi> or <hi>Ieremie</hi> defineth the time of that captiuitie,
which ended in the first yeare of <hi>Cyrus, Baruch</hi> of that which held vnto the seuenth yeare
of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> when diuerse of the Iewes returned with <hi>Zorobabel:</hi> But if they will haue
<hi>Baruch</hi> a Prophet, he must not crosse Ieremies prophesie, to beginne the time determined of
70. yeares captiuitie sooner, or to ende it later.</p>
                        <p>6. The onely solution is, that this epistle of Baruch is Apochryphall, and this is an eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
argument thereof, because he calleth this tearme of 70. yeares, 7. generations, which
hath no warrant out of Scripture, and therein disagr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>1. The opinion of some was, which <hi>Eusebius</hi> remembreth in his chronicle, concealing
the authors of that opinion, that the 70. yeares of captiuitie beganne in the 13. yeare of
Iosias: But this cannot be so: 1. Ieremiah beganne then indeede to foretell them of the euils
which should happen vnto them, but 23. yeares after he prophesied of the 70. yeares capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie,

                           </gap>.
that his eyes should not see the euils, which the Lord had threatened to bring vpon that
place.</p>
                        <p>2. Whereas there were three seuerall captiuities: the first in the first yeare of Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,
in the third yeare of the raigne of Iehoiachim, when Daniel went into captiuitie,
Dan. 1. 1. the second in the 7. and 8. yeare of Nabuchadnezzer, when Ieconias with others
was carried away captiue, 2. king. 24. 12. the third in the 11. yeare of Zedekiah, and in
the 18. yeare of Nebuchadnezzar, when the citie and temple were destroyed. 2. king. 24.
Ierem. 51. 29. Some doe beginne these 70. yeares from the first captiuitie, of which opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
are <hi>Seuerus Sulpitius, lib. 2. sarc. histor. Lyran Vatablus,</hi> in 9. Daniel: whereunto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth
also H. B. in his concent: But here cannot begin that famous captiuitie, because the
land could not be captiued, seeing the king Iehoiachim himselfe went not into captiuitie.</p>
                        <p>3. The most generall opinion is, that the beginning of the captiuitie of 70. yeares, must
be referred vnto the third captiuitie vnder Zedekiah: of this opinion are many auncient
graue authors, <hi>Iosephus lib. 11. antiquit. Clemens lib. 1. stromat. Iulius Africanus lib. 5.
Annal. E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

others: <hi>Pererius</hi> adioyneth this reason, because these 70. yeares are said here to be the
yeares of the desolation of Ierusalem, but the citie was not brought to desolation vntill the
captiuitie of Zedekiah: But this reason concludeth not, for although then there was greater
desolation brought vpon the citie, yet before when as the king and all the principall men,
and artificers were carried away, the citie beganne to be desolate: And altogether it was not
desolate, no not in the last captiuitie: for 5. yeare after in the 23. yeare of Nebuchadnezzar,
there were 745. persons caried away captiue by <hi>Nebuzaradan,</hi> Ierem. 52. 30.</p>
                        <p>4. Wherefore the more certaine opinion is, that the 70. yeares beganne with Iechonias
captiuitie, which may be confirmed by these reasons. 1. Ieremie, cap. 29. v. 10. writeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
those which were in captiuitie with Iechoniah, that after 70. yeares, the Lord would vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit
them. 2. direct mention is made of the captiuitie of Iechoniah, Esther. 2. 6. when <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

as</hi> went into captiuitie. 3. Iechonia and the rest yeelded themselues vnto the king of

which remained with <hi>Zedekiah</hi> went into Egypt: the first captiuity then rather is to be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
because the counsell of God therein was followed. 4. Ezekiel in diuerse places counteth
the yeares from the captiuitie of Iechonias, as the fift, c. 1. 3. the sixt yeare, c. 8. 1. the
seuenth, c. 20. 1. the tenth yeare, c. 37. 1. the eleuenth yeare, c. 31. 1. All which yeares are
reckoned from the time, when Iechonias went into captiuitie. 5. beside, the captiuitie of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chonias
was most famous, both in respect of the persons that went into captiuitie, and their
number: for the king himselfe, his mother, Princes, and seruants were carried away: And the
captiues were to the number of tenne thousand, 2. king. 24. 14. But in the captiuitie vnder
Zedekiah, Ieremie speaketh but of 832. persons taken captiue, cap. 52. 29. therefore from
the captiuitie of Iechonias, as the most famous, is the account of the yeares to beginne.</p>

                        <head>Quest. 6. When the 70 yeares of captiuitie
ended.</head>
                        <p>1. Some make two reckonings of these 70. yeares, one of the captiuitie of the Iewes,
which beganne with Iechonias captiuitie, and ended in the first yeare of Cyrus, the other 70.
were begunne 19. yeare after with the captiuitie of Zedekiah, and are extended 19. yeare
after, to the second yeare of <hi>Darius Hystaspis:</hi> 3. yeares of <hi>Cyrus</hi> raigne, 14. of <hi>Cambyses,</hi>
and 2. of <hi>Darius</hi> make 19. yeares, <hi>Pellican, Oecolampad.</hi> following <hi>Theodoret.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. But the Scripture in no place maketh mention of twice 70. yeares, there is
but one and the same prophesie of Ieremie, concerning the 70. yeares captiuitie, which can
be but once fulfilled: for otherwise we should make these propheticall predictions vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.
2. beside, the yeares of the Persian kings are not certaine: some vnto the 2. yeare of
<hi>Darius Hystaspis,</hi> make not so many yeares: <hi>Iunius</hi> giueth vnto <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Cambyses</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
but 9. yeares, to the <hi>Magi</hi> one yeare, and then succeeded Darius: these make but 12.
yeares with the second of Darius: Some make account of more yeares, as <hi>Bullinger</hi> giueth
vnto <hi>Cyrus</hi> 16. yeares, to <hi>Cambyses</hi> 8. yeares: some allot vnto <hi>Cyrus</hi> 30. yeares, vnto <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byses</hi>
9. yeares: <hi>Liuely</hi> in his <hi>Persian Monarchie. Pererius</hi> counteth 40. yeares, from the 1.
of <hi>Cyrus</hi> to the second of <hi>Darius:</hi> there beeing then such vncertaintie of these yeares, it is
hard to interpret a prophesie vpon so weake and vncertaine ground.</p>
                        <p>2. An other opinion is, that these 70. yeares must ende simply in the second yeare of
<hi>Darius Hystaspis.</hi> 1. because these 70. yeares are called the yeares of the desolation of the
Temple: now the Temple remained desolate vntill the 2. yeare of <hi>Darius Hystaspis.</hi> 2.
Zacharie beginning his prophesie in the 2. yeare of Darius, thus saith, c. 1. 12. thou hast
beene displeased with vs, now these threescore and tenne yeares. 3. <hi>Mardocheus</hi> who liued
in the time of king <hi>Assuerus,</hi> who is thought to be <hi>Artaxerxes Mnemon,</hi> who succeeded
an 150. yeares after the 1. yeare of Cyrus, should then be aboue an 130. yeare olde, if the
70. yeares ended in the first of <hi>Cyrus:</hi> of this opinion are, <hi>Clemens Alexand. lib. 1. stromat.
Euseb. in Chroni. Isidor. lib. 5. Etymolog.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. These arguments conclude not. 1. though the temple was not reedified till
the raigne of Darius: yet because the people had libertie to returne, and to repaire both the
Temple and citie in the first of Cyrus, the captiuitie and desolation ended then: But if they
wil extend the time of desolation so long till both the Temple and citie were fully repaired,
then that time must hold out yet longer: for the citie was not fully repaired vntill the 20.
yeare of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> whom <hi>Pererius</hi> taketh for <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus, Iunius for Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes
Mnemon,</hi> when Nehemias by the kings grauntreturned to repaire the citie, and
build the walls.</p>
                        <p>2. The Prophet Zacharie affirmeth not the 70. yeares then first to be expired: but his
meaning is, that they had endured the 70. yeares captiuitie which were prophesied of, and
yet they sawe not the full restitution of their citie and countrey.</p>
                        <p>3. To the third argument <hi>Pererius</hi> answereth, that whereas the words in the text stand
thus, <hi>there was in the citie of Shushan a certaine Iewe, whose name was Mordecai, the sonne
of Iair, the sonne of Shemei, the sonne of Kish a man of Iemini, which had beene carried away
from Ierusalem, with the captiuitie that was carried away with Iechoniah:</hi> these words, <hi>which
had beene carried away,</hi> he would haue referred not to <hi>Mordecai,</hi> but to <hi>Kish,</hi> that he was
carried away captiue: so also <hi>Iunius:</hi> But <hi>Pererius</hi> answer is taken away by that text of the
Apochryphall Esther, which is canonicall Scripture with them, where c. 11. v. 3. it is said,
that <hi>Mordechai, erat de numero eorum captiuorum, &amp;c. was of the number of those captines,
whom Nebuchadnezzar translated with Iechoniah: Iunius</hi> may be refelled by his own chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle:
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:18834:140"/>
for vnto the raigne of <hi>Assuerus,</hi> whom he taketh to be <hi>Xerxes,</hi> he numbreth but 46.
yeares, from Cyrus first: <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Cambyses</hi> raigned 9. yeares, the <hi>Magi</hi> one yeare, <hi>Dari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
Hystaspis</hi> 36. yeares: vnto this adde 70. yeares, of the captiuitie: all make not full
an 120. yeares: it is not like that in this tearme, there were so many descents and generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
namely these sowre, of <hi>Kish, Shemei, Iair, Mordecai:</hi> therefore the best answer here is,
that so many yeares must not be giuen vnto the Persian kings: Mordecai beeing one of those
which were carried into captiuitie, Ezra. 2. 1, 2. might be then an auncient man, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
neere of such yeares as is supposed.</p>
                        <p>4. But this opinion may be refelled by the former argument, that from the last captiuitie
vnto the 2. of <hi>Darius</hi> when the Temple was reedified must needes be aboue 70. yeares, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the most doe hold at the least 40. yeares betweene the 1. of Cyrus, and the second of
Darius: and betweene the last captiuitie of <hi>Zedekiah</hi> in the 18. yeare of Nebuchadnezzar,
and the 1. of <hi>Cyrus</hi> were more then 30. yeares: for that captiuitie was in the 18. yeare of
Nebuchadnezzar, Ierem. 52. 29. who raigned in all 45. yeares, there remayned then 27.
yeares of his raigne, <hi>Balthazar</hi> had 3. yeares, then came betweene them <hi>Euilmerodach,</hi>
who as <hi>Iosephus</hi> writeth, raigned 18. yeares, <hi>lib. 10. antiquit. c.</hi> 12.</p>
                        <p>3. It remayneth then, that the 70. yeares of captiuitie must haue their determination in
the first yeare of Cyrus: as is euident, 2. Chron. 36. 22. then was the word and prophesie
of Ieremie finished: And this is agreeable to the prophesie of I say: <hi>he saith of Cyrus, &amp;c. he
shall performe all my desire: saying to Ierusalem, thou shalt be built, and to the Temple, thy
foundations shall be surcly layd,</hi> I say. 44. 28.</p>

1. Daniel maketh an ample and large confession of his and the peoples sinnes and vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
to v. 7. 2. of the iustice and righteousnesse of God in punishing their sinnes yet in
mercie, to v. 15. In the confession of their sinnes are set forth, 1. the manner, which is am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified
by fowre degrees, <hi>they haue sinned, committed iniquitie, done wickedly, yea rebeiled:</hi>
they haue sinned not of ignorance and infirmitie, but wittingly and obstinately. 2. the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
in leauing Gods commandements, and not giuing care to his Prophets, v. 6. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
is either generall, to v. 10. or particular to v. 15.</p>
                        <p>In the generall. 1. be confesseth Gods iustice in bringing vpon them shame, which is
amplified by a threefold enumeration of the people: by their countrey, <hi>the inhabitants of
Iudah and Ierusalem, yea all Israel:</hi> by their place and situation, <hi>neere and farre off thorough
all countreys:</hi> by their degrees and callings, <hi>euen vpon their kings and Princes,</hi> v. 8. 2. he
confesseth Gods mercie, v. 9.</p>
                        <p>In the particular confession, is set forth Gods iustice in punishing their sinne: where 1.
their sinne is amplified. 2. the punishment. In the amplification of their sinne, namely their
disobedience, three circumstances are expressed, whose voice they disobeyed, <hi>the Lords,</hi> by
whose ministrie, <hi>by the Prophets,</hi> and who were disobedient, <hi>euen all Israel.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Concerning the punishment three things are declared. 1. the prediction of it, in the
commination set forth in Moses lawe, v. 11. 2. the fulfilling and accomplishment of it, v. 12.
3. the qualitie and condition of it, the greatest plague vnder the whole heauen was fallen
vpon them: And this last part of the greatnesse of the iudgement is amplified, 1. by the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie
of the prediction. 2. by their sinne of securitie, in not beeing humbled by prayer
vnto God, 3. by the equitie and iustice of God, v. 14.</p>
                        <p>Then followeth the second part of Daniels prayer, his deprecation and earnest petition:
wherein he prayeth: for two things. 1. that the Lord would turne his wrath from them. 2.
that he would returne and shewe his gracious fauour toward Ierusalem. The first petition is
enforced by these arguments. 1. from the example of their deliuerance out of Egypt. 2. by
the effects thereof, the renowne and praise which the Lord had obtained thereby. 3. from
the confession of their sinne. 4. from Gods righteousnesse, which must be vnderstood in
keeping and performing his promise. 5. from the sequell and euent, they were become a
reproach vnto their enemies. 6. from the interest and propertie, which God had in Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
he calleth it his citie, v. 16. The other petition that the Lord would shewe his fauour,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:18834:141"/>
is amplified by these reasons. 1. because it is his Sanctuarie. 2. from the miserie and desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof, it <hi>lyeth wast,</hi> and therefore was to be pitied. 3. from the cause, for the Lord, the
Messiahs sake. 4. from the qualitie and condition of the people and citie, they were the
Church of God, his name was called vpon among them. 5. from the opposition betweene
their worthines, which they disclaymed, and the Lords mercies, which they onely relyed
vpon. 6. from the end, he asketh that Gods name thereby might be set forth: <hi>for thine owne
sake, O God.</hi>

onely a faithfull man, but a Prophet himselfe, made no doubt, but that God; beeing most
constant in not changing, and most powerfull in performing what he hath decreed, would
accordingly remember his people.</p>
                        <p>These reasons then may be rendred, why Daniel prayeth notwithstanding he was assured
of the certaintie of this prophesie. 1. <hi>Theodoret</hi> saith, <hi>timens Daniel, ne peccata Iudaeorum
diuinis promissis obstarent, preces apud Deum multiplicavit,</hi> Daniel fearing least the
sinnes of the Iewes might hinder the diuine promises, doth multiplie his prayers before
God, &amp;c. The promises, as likewise the comminations of God are of two sorts: some are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute,
which shall most surely come to passe, such was the promise of the comming of the
Messiah: some are conditionall: as was the promise that the seede of Abraham should inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
Canaan for euer, which was vpon condition of their obedience: Such was the commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
threatned against Niniueh conditionall, vnlesse they did repent: and Daniel, as <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret</hi>
thinketh, might take this promise of deliuerance after 70. yeares to be conditional, and
might feare, least the sinnes of the people should hinder it.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Hierome</hi> giueth this satisfaction: Daniel prayeth not as incredulous, <hi>sed vt quod Deus
per suam promiserat clementiam, per ipsius preces impleret,</hi> but that what God had promised
by his clemencie, might be fulfilled through his prayers, &amp;c. his meaning is this: that as
God had appointed the deliuerance of his people, so also he had ordained the meanes, that
it should be obtayned by earnest prayers and supplications of his seruants: for both of these
doe fall vnder the diuine ordination, <hi>res, &amp; suus modus,</hi> the thing it selfe, and the manner
and meanes thereof, <hi>Lyran.</hi> So although God haue certainely preordained the saluation of
the elect, yet they must walke in the way which God hath appointed, and vse the meanes to
further their saluation.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Lyranus</hi> addeth further: Daniel also prayeth to this end, <hi>vt ostenderet se gratum Deo
de promissione prius facta,</hi> to shewe his thankfulnes to God, for so gracious a promise of their
deliuerance alreadie made.</p>

learned Hebrewes also affirme: <hi>H. Br. in Daniel.</hi> And this may be the reason hereof, why

in that he saith, <hi>whom I had seene in the vision before,</hi> that is the vision set forth in the 8. cap.
which was expounded vnto Daniel by the Angel Gabriel, c. 8. 16. it maketh much for the
confirmation of Daniel, that hauing experience alreadie of the faithfulnesse of this holy
messenger, he should now be out of doubt, <hi>Polan.</hi> 5. He is said to come flying, to signifie
the diligence and readinesse of these holy spirits in executing the will of God: and though

                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. The Angels beeing celestiall treatures, cannot be supposed to haue <hi>aerie</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies:
the heauens are of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                           </gap> the heauens, doe farre exceede the subtiltie of
the aire. 2. God the creator is an infinite spirit farre remote from all bodily matter, in
comparison of whom the Angels and created spirits may be said to be of a mixt and concret
nature: yet they are in themselues of a spirituall and immateriall constitution: otherwise by
the same argument, it would followe, that because God is a spirit, therefore the Angels are
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:18834:142"/>
not spirits. 3. that place in the Psalme describeth not the making and constitution of the
Angels, as though they should consist either of aerie or fierie bodies, but it sheweth their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
onely and ministrie, that God vseth his Angels as the winds and fire, to execute his will:
to the which purpose the Apostle alleadgeth it, Heb. 1. 7. 4. And in that Angels are and
may be portraited by picture, it prooueth not that they haue any bodily constitution, but
that they appeared in some visible shape, which is expressed by picture.</p>
                        <p>2. The sounder opinion then is, that <hi>Angeli sunt corporis expertes,</hi> Angels are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
bodies: which is the iudgement of <hi>Gregor. Nyssen. in tractat. de oration.</hi> of <hi>Chrysostome
homil. 22. in Genes.</hi> of <hi>Cyrill in</hi> c. 12. <hi>Ioan.</hi> of <hi>Theodoret, in c. 12. Daniel.</hi> and of <hi>Thom.
Aquin.</hi> And this assertion may further be confirmed by these reasons. 1. because Angels
are called spirits in the Scripture: therefore they are of a spirituall nature. 2. the soule of man
is of a spirituall substance, not of any corporall constitution, much more the Angels. 3. If
Angels had bodies, it would follow, that they are circumscriptible, and occupie a place, as
other bodies doe: but they cannot be hemmed in by walls, doores, or such like limits and
bounds. 4. one bodie doth not penetrate or pierce another, but giueth way, as the aire to
the water: but the spirits passe through substances, as through doores, walls, and the like;
therefore they haue no bodies.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Pintus</hi> resolueth not of either of these opinions, because the Church hath not defined
and determined what is to be held of this matter: and concludeth thus: <hi>quid hac in re verum
sit, Deus ipse viderit, &amp;c.</hi> what commeth neere vnto the truth herein, God himselfe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
&amp;c. But it is more consonant and agreeable to Scripture, that Angels are altogether of
a spirituall nature, as hath been shewed, and therefore we may safely rest in this as a true po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
and well grounded conclusion.</p>

directed him.</p>
                        <p>2. And beside, God by diuerse miraculous workes did consecrate the time of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

came downe from heauen, which consumed the sacrifice, with the water powred vpon it,

is a type and figure of an other, that in the handling thereof many things are deliuered,
which agree vnto the thing that is prefigured, not vnto the type: as in the Psalmes, Dauid and
Salomon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                              <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                           </gap> as types of Christ: where many things (as Psal. 2. Psal. 7<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

concerning the deliuerance of the people, he also foretelleth of the spirituall deliuerance by
Christ: that the people should not rest in that temporall benefit, but be in continuall expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
of the comming of the Messiah, by whom they should be redeemed from the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
of sinne, <hi>Polan.</hi> As also because the people notwithstanding this captiuitie of 70. years,
continued in their sinne, the Angel sheweth that God would yet giue them a longer time
ofrepentance, euen of seuentie weekes of yeares: after which time, if they repented not,
their citie should be destroyed, according to the determinate sentence of God, <hi>Iun. in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentar.</hi>

or 50. yeares, make in euerie weeke 350. yeares, and the whole summe will rise to
24500. yeares: but if euerie day should be counted for an 100. yeares, the weeke shall
containe 700. yeares, and 70. weekes, 49000. yeares. Against this exposition <hi>Lyranus</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadgeth
these two reasons. 1. no where in Scripture is the name of a weeke taken in any
such sense, either for 50. yeares, or an 100. yeares: but either it signifieth weeks of dayes, or
weekes of yeares. 2. the world shall not continue so many thousand yeares, neither should
this prophesie be yet fulfilled concerning the destruction of the citie and Sanctuarie: all
which things we see came to passe aboue a 1500. yeare since.</p>
                        <p>4. It remayneth then, that we are here precisely to vnderstand 70. weekes of yeares: eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
weeke containing 7. yeares: for so is a weeke of yeares taken, Leuit. 25. 8. <hi>thou shalt

                        <head>Quest. 17 Why 70. weeks are said to be cut out
or determined.</head>
                        <p>Whereas the Latine translator readeth, <hi>abbreuiatae sunt,</hi> 70. weekes are abbreuiated or
shortened, this hath giuen occasion of some question. 1. <hi>Augustine epistol. 80. ad Hesy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chium,</hi>
maketh mention how some thus interpreted those words of our Sauiour, Matth. 24.
22. <hi>that for the elects <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ake those dayes should be shortened,</hi> that the dayes of persecution should
be shorter then the naturall day of 24. houres: and thus as well might some suppose the
weekes to be said to be shortened<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like as we reade that in Iosuah and Hezekias time, the
day was lengthened, and made longer then the natural day: But this cannot be the meaning,
for it cannot be shewed, that during the space of those 70. weeke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>, which make 490. yeares,
or for almost two thousand yeare since, any day fell out shorter then the ordinarie course of
the naturall day.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Augustine</hi> in the former place reporteth an other opinion of some, who thought that
the time appointed for the comming of the Messiah, which God had purposed to haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed,
was at the instant prayers of the Prophets, and other of the elect shortened, and
sooner accomplished: like as <hi>Augustine</hi> thinketh, that the time of 120. yeares set for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
of the old world, was cut short by 20. yeares.</p>
                        <p>But this interpretation cannot stand. 1. God by this meanes, if he had shortened the
time, which he had appointed, should be mutable and changeable. 2. they must shew out
of Scripture, that there was a longer time appointed for the comming of the Messiah, which
the Lord abridged. 3. the time limited for the repentance of the old world, was not shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened:
but whereas first mention is made of Noahs age of 500. yeares, Gen. 5. 32. and then
the time of 120. yeares is prescribed, c. 6. 3. and yet Noah was but 600. yeare old, when
he entred into the arke, Gen. 7. 6. it must be acknowledged that the limitation of that time
is somewhat transposed, and that in order of time it was reuealed to Noah before he was
500. yeare old, but it is deferred to the 6. chapter, least the historie of the generation of
the fathers should haue beene interrupted. See more hereof, <hi>Hexapl. in Genes.</hi> chap. 6.
quest. 6.</p>
                        <p>3. A third opinion there is, which is ascribed to <hi>Iulius Africanus, Theodoret, Albertus,
Beda, Rupertus, Carthusianus, Hug. Card.</hi> that here must be vnderstood the yeares of the
moone, which containe but 354. dayes, eleuen dayes lesse then the yeare of the Sunne,
which consisteth of 365. dayes: so that 70. weekes of such yeares of the Moone, that is, 490.
yeares, are but equiualent to 475. yeares of the Sunne, <hi>Rupert.</hi> euerie weeke of the yeares
of the Sunne exceeding a weeke of the yeares of the Moone by 77. dayes.</p>
                        <p>But <hi>Lyranus</hi> well refuteth this opinion by these two reasons. 1. because the Hebrewes
vsed not to count by the yeares of the Moone, but by the full and iust yeares of the Sunne:
otherwise where the Scripture setteth down the summes of yeares, as 430. of the soiourning
of Israel in Egypt and Canaan, Exod. 12. 480. from the departure of Israel out of Egypt
to the building of the Temple, 1. King. 6. 1. there should be no certaintie in these compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations;
but if the account should be made by the course of the Moone, there should be few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
yeares in these summes, then they are reckoned for. 2. Againe, whereas the Israelites kept
their Passeouer, on the 14. day of the first Moone, if they should haue obserued the yeare
of the moone, they should euerie yeare keepe the Passeouer, an 11. dayes sooner then other,
and so in processe of time, they should haue obserued that feast euerie moneth thorough
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:18834:143"/>
the yeare.</p>
                        <p>4. A fourth exposition is, that <hi>abbreuia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>e hebdomadas,</hi> to abbreuiate or shorten the
weekes, is all one, as <hi>paucas constiture,</hi> to appoint but fewe weekes: this time was but short
in respect of other prophesies made concerning the Messiah, as that to Adam, Gen. 3. and
to Abraham, Gen. 22. that in his seede all nations should be blessed: these prophesies were
to be fulfilled many yeares after, but now there remayned but a fewe weekes for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
of this: In this sense the dayes are said to be shortened for the elects sake, Matth.
24. 22. that is, they should continue but a short time those dayes of affliction, <hi>Pererius.</hi>
But we refuse this exposition also, because it is grounded vpon a corrupt translation of the
word <hi>chatach,</hi> which signifieth not to <hi>abbreuiate,</hi> but <hi>to cut out,</hi> and so consequently, <hi>to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>5. <hi>Barbinel</hi> a cauilling Rabbine, by the word <hi>chatach,</hi> which signifieth to cut, would
haue signified the cutting afflictions, which the people of God should endure all this time:
but all this tearme was not a time of affliction to the people of God: they had many prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
dayes, and had some breathing time, after their returne out of captiuitie.</p>
                        <p>6. The word <hi>chatach</hi> then, is well interpreted here, <hi>determined,</hi> or <hi>prefixed,</hi> certainely
appointed and decreed with God, <hi>praefinitae,</hi> defined, <hi>Vatab. decisae,</hi> cut out, <hi>Pagnin. Mon.
Iun. Polan.</hi> and this further is well obserued by some, that here a verbe of the singular num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
is ioyned to a word of the plurall, 70. <hi>weekes is determined,</hi> to shewe, that euerie one of
these weekes from the first to the last shall be particularly and precisely complete, <hi>Liuely.</hi>

is expressed by
weeks.</head>
                        <p>1. The seuenth number was of great obseruation among the Iewes: the seuenth day, the
seuenth yeare, the seuenth seuenth yeare, which was the Iubile in the 49. yeare, were all
times of holy rest: therefore to signifie the great yeare of rest, and Iubile at the comming of
the Messiah, when there should be a generall remission of the sinnes of the world, this time
is reckoned by weekes, and by seuen times tenne weekes of yeares, which make 10. Iubilies:
for tenne times 49. yeares, make iust 490. yeares, <hi>Polan.</hi> 2. An other reason is this, <hi>volebat

the seuentie weekes of yeares, with the 70. yeares of captiuitie, shewing that for 70. yeares
of captiuitie, they should enioy seuen times 70. yeares of deliuerance: the Prophet then,
<hi>confert Dei gratiam cum iudicio,</hi> doth compare the grace and mercie of God, with his iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Calvin.</hi> 3. But in that the Angel speaketh simply of 70. weekes, not adding of dayes
or yeares, therein is obserued the propheticall manner of speach, which is for the most part
obscure and darke, as treating of mysticall and hid matters: whereas in historicall narrations
an other kind of plaine and open speach and phrase is vsed.</p>

<hi>the people of Daniel,</hi> not his people, because they were euill, as though God had reiected

Daniels, and not the Lords people, because of that great sinne, which they should commit,
in putting the Messiah to death: but in this sense neither would Daniel acknowlege them to

                        <p>1. <hi>R. Salamon,</hi> who endeth these 70. weekes at the second destruction of the citie and
Temple by <hi>Titus,</hi> thus interpreteth, that then the Iewes should endure a longer captiuitie,
then before: and thereby should learne, to leaue off their sinnes, and by their long punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

                           <hi>Contra. 1. Lyranus</hi> thus refelleth the Rabbine: that the Iewes are so farre off from lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
their sinnes by this long captiuitie, that they are rather worse: for their periuries, vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
profane oathes, are notoriously knowne. And seeing God punished their idolatrie, but
with captiuitie of 70. years, and now they haue endured captiuitie more then twice 7. hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeares, it must needs be a greater sinne for the which they sustaine so long a time of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
which can be none other, then their killing the Lord of life the Blessed Messiah. 2.
<hi>Paulus Burgen.</hi> addeth further, that this finishing of iniquitie must be within the 70. weeks,
but that ceasing from sinne which the Rabbine imagineth, must follow after these 70. weeks
expired. 3. adde hereunto, that no man by the workes of the law is iustified, or can doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing acceptable vnto God: how then can the Iewes without the Messiah obtaine remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of sinnes? And againe, men by their punishment, though it be neuer so long and great,
cannot satisfie for their sinnes; for then they which are tormented in hell, might at length

                        <p>2. Some following the Latine text, <hi>to consummate or finish sinne,</hi> doe thus interpret it,
<hi>to make perfect sinne:</hi> as the Iewes were come to the height of sinne when they crucified
Christ: in this sense our Sauiour saith, Matth. 23. <hi>Fulfillye the measure of your fathers:</hi> thus
expound <hi>Chrysostome, orat. 2. cont. Iudaeos. Theodoret</hi> vpon this place, and <hi>Eusebius, lib. 8. de

doe shewe, that this phrase signifieth rather the consumption, then consummation of
sinne.</p>
                        <p>3. Some reading <hi>to finish sinne,</hi> vnderstand it of the consumption of sinne, and taking of
it away by the death of Christ: as a candle is said to be ended, when it is consumed, <hi>Hugo.</hi> so
is the word <hi>finishing</hi> taken, Isa. 40. 2. <hi>Speake comfortably to Ierusalem, &amp;c. that her warfare
is finished, and her iniquitie is pardoned. Perer.</hi> so also <hi>Calv. Genevens. Vatabl. Pintus:</hi> this

iniquitie, or of some speciall nation, but of the sinnes of all; these words are better vnderstood
also generally, that by the comming of Christ, and preaching of the Gospel, there should be
a generall restraint of sinne: as many which made no conscience before of adulterie, idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,

washing and wiping, by scraping, as a blot in writing, and by dissipating or dissoluing, as
when a cloud or mist is dispersed: and so in all these phrases sinne is said to be taken away: as
Dauid saith, <hi>Psal. 51. wash away my sinne,</hi> and S. Paul, that Christ hath rased out the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing
of our sinne, Colos. 2. And Isay 44. 22. the Lord saith, <hi>I haue put away thy trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression

                        <p>3. Hereby then rather is signified that Christ hath made reconciliation for sinne, that is,

this is the ende of our holinesse and righteousnesse, to be made like and conformable to the
image of the sonne, as the Apostle speaketh, <hi>Rom. 8. 29. Perer.</hi> But here is vnderstood, not
that righteousnesse which Christ hath in himselfe, but that which is communicated vnto vs:
for here are two benefits rehearsed, which should come by the Messiah, the first is the taking

                        <p>2. Some by iustice vnderstand the preaching of righteousnesse by the gospel, as <hi>Lyranus,</hi>

the preaching of the gospell shall not be euerlasting: for in the next world, there shall be no

                        <p>3. Some by <hi>iustice</hi> interpret the actiue iustice, which God exercised vpon the crosse in

righteousnesse.</head>
                        <p>1. The iustice or righteousnesse of faith in Christ is called euerlasting, in respect of the
iustice of the lawe: <hi>non euanescet sicut iustitia legis,</hi> it shall not vanish away as the iustice of
the law, <hi>Osiand.</hi> which was a temporarie iustice consisting in the obseruation of legall rites
and ceremonies, which were not to continue, <hi>Perer.</hi> such was the righteousnesse of Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
and Elizabeth, which are called iust, because they walked in all the commandements, and
<gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, constitutions and ordinances of the lawe, Luk. 1. 6. so also the <hi>gloss.</hi> it is called
eternall iustice, <hi>quae legis iustitiam vincat,</hi> which should exceede the iustice of the lawe.</p>
                        <p>2. This iustice of faith is euerlasting, because it is <hi>omnium temporum,</hi> for all times:
all that euer liued in the world, were iustified by the iustice of faith in Christ, <hi>Bulling.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. And is eternall, <hi>quia inchoatur in via, in patria perficitur,</hi> it is begunne here as in the

                        <head>Here followe certaine questions of the iustice of
Christ, in what manner, wherein, and in what
measure it is applyed.</head>
                        <head>Quest. 25. Whether as Christs satisfaction for the punishment of sinne
is imputed to vs by faith, so likewise
his innocencie.</head>
                        <p>It must of necessitie followe, if that Christ hath obtayned and purchased for vs a perfect
and absolute redemption, that he hath discharged our whole debt, not onely in satisfying
for the punishment of the lawe, but in imputing also vnto vs his innocencie and obedience,
as may appeare by these reasons.</p>
                        <p>1. Christ is of greater power to communicate vnto vs his innocencie, then Adam was to
deriue vnto vs the guilt of his sinne and disobedience: then as by Adam, sinne was propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and death came in by sinne, Rom. 5. 12. so it is necessarie, that we should receiue from
Christ not onely exemption from death by his death, but be cloathed also with his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse.</p>
                        <p>2. We cannot stand in iudgement before God, vnlesse we be endued with perfect iustice:
now perfect iustice is that whereby the commandements of God are exactly fulfilled, which
was performed not onely by that one act of Christs death, but by the perfect innocencie and
holinesse of his whole life: therefore the whole obedience of Christ must be imputed and
communicated vnto vs.</p>
                        <p>3. Christ discharged our whole debt: Now we are debters not onely in respect of the
punishment of the lawe, which by our disobedience we haue deserued: but the lawe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acteth
also of vs perfect obedience, and integritie from sinne: in both these respects then we
haue neede of Christ.</p>
                        <p>4. The Apostle saith directly, Rom. 10. 4. <hi>that Christ is the ende of the lawe for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
vnto euerie one that beleeueth,</hi> that is, by faith the righteousnes of Christ in fulfilling
the lawe is imputed vnto vs in as full and ample manner, as if we had fulfilled the lawe our
selues.</p>
                        <p>5. If Christ hath not fulfilled the lawe for vs, it would followe, that the law remaineth
still to be fulfilled by vs, which is impossible.</p>

not the fulf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                              <hi>Answ.</hi> The righteousnes of the lawe by works, and of the gospel by faith, are not two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse
righteousnes, for they differ neither in <hi>matter,</hi> as both requiring that obedience which
is to be performed vnto God, not in <hi>forme,</hi> for the lawe of God is the rule of righteousnes in
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:18834:145"/>
both: they differ in the <hi>efficient</hi> and worker: the legal righteousnes must be performed by
man himselfe, the <hi>Euangelical</hi> by Christ in our name: and in the <hi>ende;</hi> for the ende of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
righteousnes is the glorie of man, if he could keepe it by his owne strength: the ende of
the <hi>Euangelical iustice</hi> is the glorie of God, in the setting forth of his mercie. So then one
and the same righteousnes, is both of the law in respect of Christ, who fulfilled the law, and
it is not of the law in respect of vs, because we fulfill not the law, but of faith, because we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
in him, who hath fulfilled the law for vs.</p>

loue of God, and of man, it was necessarie that Christ should die: for therein he shewed
his perfect loue vnto God his father in beeing obedient vnto him: Ioh. 14. 31. <hi>It is, that the

                           <p>3. <hi>Obiect.</hi> The law bindeth either vnto obedience of the law, or to the punishment, not
vnto both: if then Christs obedience be imputed vnto vs, the imputation of his satisfaction
by his death would seeme to be superfluous.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. That proposition is not simply true, that the law bindeth either vnto obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the law, or to the punishment: for the law doth not properly binde vnto punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
but that is added as a commination, the rather to mooue vnto obedience of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement:
as when the Lord saide to Adam, that in the day he did eate of the forbidden
fruit, he should die the death: that commination was no part of the bond or obligation of
the commandement, but a conditionail commination, if the other were not performed. 2.
We must distinguish betweene the state of mans integritie, and his fall: while man stood in
his integritie, he was onely bound vnto the obedience of the commandement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but since his
fall, man both is subiect to the obedience of the law, which is not giuen him in vaine, and to
the punishment, because he can not fulfill the law. 3. Againe, of the reprobate and wicked
God exacteth onely the punishment due vnto their disobedience: but of his elect he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
both the obedience of the law, and the penaltie, both which are performed in Christ: he
hath fulfilled for them the one, and suffered the other. <hi>ex Polan.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>4. <hi>Obiect.</hi> If Christ hath fulfilled the law for vs, and we are by his obedience made righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
then it would follow, that no other obedience or holines of life should be required
of vs.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Ans.</hi> It followeth not. Indeede that perfect and absolute obedience of Christ, whereby
he perfectly fulfilled the law, is not exacted of vs: for Christs obedience is ours by faith: yet
an imperfect obedience is required, as a testimonie of our faith, and signe of our thankfulnes
vnto God: Like as it followeth not, because Christ died for vs the death of the bodie, that
therefore it is not necessarie that we should die: the death of the bodie still remaineth euen
in the children of God, for it is appointed for men to die once, Hebr. 9. 27. but death is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
now as a punishment, or as a satisfaction for sinne, but as a condition of their mortall
nature, and a passage vnto a better life: After the same manner, obedience is now required of
the members of Christ, but neither such an obedience, as Christs was, that is perfect, abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
nor to the same ende, to be meritorious or satisfactorie for sinne.</p>
                           <p>5. <hi>Obiect.</hi> How are we made iust by the obedience of Christ, seeing that we in Christs

6. <hi>Obiect.</hi> Seeing Christ died to that ende, that we should be iustified by his death, as
the Apostle saith, 2. Cor. 5. 21. <hi>He made him sinne for vs that knew no sinne, that we should be
made the righteousnes of God in him:</hi> how then is our righteousnes obtained by the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of his life?</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The obedience of Christ in his life and death can not be seuered: for in perfect
obedience is required constancie and perseuerance vnto the ende: therefore the obedience
of Christ in his death and suffering, is a part of his integritie, innocencie, and righteousnes.
2. Neither doth that place prooue, that our righteousnes was purchased onely by Christs
death: but to make that a perfect and acceptable sacrifice, the integritie of his life is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
for in that he knew no sinne in himselfe, (but our sinnes were imputed vnto him, as his
righteousnes is vnto vs) therein he was the vnspotted lambe, and so was made for vs the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of atonement. We see then that euen to make the sacrifice of his death acceptable, the
obedience and integritie of his life was requisite.</p>
                           <p>7. <hi>Obiect.</hi> How is Christs obedience made ours, seeing he as a creature was subiect to
the law, and so was obedient thereunto for himselfe.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. It followeth not, that because Christ as man, was a creature, that therefore he
was for himselfe subiect to the law: this is true of those which are creatures for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues:
but Christ was not made a creature for himselfe, he was not incarnate, and
made man for himselfe, but for vs: therefore not for himselfe, but for vs, was he sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to the law. 2. And further, that Christ was not for himselfe bound and subiect
to the law, it may appeare by these arguments: 1. to them onely the law was giuen,
whome the ends of the law concerne, which are these: before the fall of man the Law was
giuen to these two ends; to teach man the will of God, and to containe and keepe him in
obedience to the will of God. After mans fall the law likewise hath two ends: to teach man
to know himselfe, and to acknowledge his sinnes, and to stirre him vp to seeke the remedie
against the same: But none of all these endes doe appertaine vnto Christ: he needed not
to be taught the will of God, nor yet to haue any helpe to containe him in his obedience:
he had no sinnes to acknowledge, nor needed any such remedie: therefore the lawe
was not giuen vnto him. 2. The law was not giuen to him to keepe, who is the ende
of the law: but Christ is the ende of the law, as the Apostle sheweth, Rom. 10. 4.
and the law is a schoolemaster to bring vs vnto Christ, Gal. 3. 19. 3. Christ is aboue the
law, and Lord of the law, euen as man, therefore not vnder the law, or subiect vnto it: the
first is euident, where Christ saith, the Sonne of man is Lord of the Sabbath; which is a part
of the law: and as he is Lord of part of the law, so of the whole.</p>
                           <p>8. <hi>Obiect.</hi> The Apostle saith, Heb. 10. 19. <hi>By the blood of Iesus we may be bold to enter
into the holy place:</hi> &amp; S. Iohn saith, 1. epist. 1. 7. <hi>The blood of Iesus doth purge vs from all sinne:</hi>
what neede then the imputation of the innocencie and obedience of Christ?</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Though the blood of Christ onely be named, yet by a <hi>synecdoche,</hi> part beeing
taken for the whole, other parts of his oblation are signified: as his obedience and innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
whereby his blood was made a sacrifice of atonement, acceptable vnto God: for God
was not simply delighted with the shedding of Christs blood, but with his obedience: as
<hi>Bernard</hi> well saith, <hi>non mors, sed voluntas placuit spont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap> morientis,</hi> not the death, but the
will of Christ, dying of his owne accord, was pleasing vnto God. 2. If all were in deede as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed
to Christs blood, then the oblation of his flesh and bodie, the anguish and agonie of
his soule, had beene superfluous: by the blood then the other parts are signified: but the
blood is named, as the most conspicuous part of his oblation, and because it answered to the
type, the blood of the legal sacrifices. 3. And though the blood of Christ doe purge vs
from all sinne, yet not from that b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>nd and obligation, whereby we are tied to keepe the
law: which we are freed from by the imputation of the obedience of Christ. 4. So then
the expresse mention of the blood of Christ, doth not exclude his innocencie and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
but onely the blood of the legal sacrifices, and mans merit, and all other humane
meanes, which auaile not to saluation.</p>
                           <p>9. <hi>Obiect.</hi> But seeing Adams disobedience, by the which sinne entred, was but one of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
in eating the forbidden fruit: one act likewise of Christs obedience, which was in the
sacrifice of his death, may seeme to be sufficient for our iustification.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Ans.</hi> Though God gaue but one precept vnto Ada<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap> for these reasons: 1. because one

<pb n="291" facs="tcp:18834:146"/>
of one commandement was enough to make man guiltie of eternall death. 3. And
thereby mans impotencie and weaknes appeared, who in the state of integritie was not able
to keepe that one commandement: yet in that one precept were contained and included
all the precepts afterwards giuen in the morall law: as <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith,<note place="margin">lib. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

there was pride, in that man loued rather to be in his owne power, then Gods: there was sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge,
because man beleeued not God; and homicide, because he cast himselfe headlong
into death: there was spirituall fornication, because the integritie of mans minde was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by the enticement of the serpent: and there was theft, because he vsurped the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
fruit: and couetousnes, in that he desired more, then sufficed. Wherefore seeing that in
Adams transgression, we are made guiltie of many sinnes, we haue neede also of Christs
whole righteousnes.</p>
                           <p>10. <hi>Obiect.</hi> If all Christs innocencie is imputed vnto vs for our righteousnes, then all
Christs acts must be imputed vnto vs likewise for our iustification.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. It followeth not, that because all Christs acts which concerned the iustice and
fulfilling of the law, are imputed vnto vs for righteousnes, that therefore all his acts are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted:
for his descension, conception, incarnation, his miracles, are not imputed vnto vs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they were no part of the fulfilling of the law. So then it is true, that all the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
which is imputed vnto vs, Christ wrought for vs; and that whatsoeuer Christ did, he
wrought for vs: he was conceiued, borne, circumcised, fasted for vs: yet all Christs acts are
not applied vnto vs for our iustification, but onely those, wherein properly consisted Christs
obedience, and the fulfilling of the law: And thus much shal suffice of this question, abridged

                        <p>The righteousnes of Christ imputed vnto vs by faith, is farre more excellent many waies
then the iustice which Adam had in the state of his innocencie. 1. That was the iustice of

effects: the iustice of Christ is meritorious of eternall life, it ouercame death, subdued the
deuill: none of all which Adams righteousnes could doe. 3. Christs iustice is eternall and
immutable, but Adams iustice was but temporarie for a time. 4. And we are in Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
to a more excellent state, then we lost in Adam, which was but terrene and mutable;

                        <p>1. It is not agreeable with Gods iustice, to iustifie a sinner, by that righteousnes, which
is not intended vnto him, nor wrought for him: but seeing Christ wrought not righteousnes
for himselfe, but intended it wholly vnto vs, and our benefit; it very well standeth with Gods
iustice, that we should be iustified thereby. 2. And this iustice of Christ, which is externall
and without vs, is more auaileable to saue and iustifie vs, then if it were in our selues: for
then it were subiect to change and alter, as all other gifts in vs are mutable and changeable:
but now this sauing righteousnes is in a subiect, namely Christ, immutable and vnchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
3. And this righteousnes is verily made ours by faith: it is not an imiginarie or suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

And as our sinnes were imputed to Christ, and he verely suffered death the punishment of
sinne: so we by the imputation of his righteousnes are verely made partakers of euerlasting

But <hi>Lyranus</hi> euidently conuinceth this Rabbinicall conceit, by that place of Ieremie, 3. 16.

                        <p>1. This title and appellation is giuen vnto Christ, both as God and man: As God in foure
respects: 1. because he is holy of himselfe, and hath it not from any other. 2. this holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
is essentiall in him, not accidentall, as it is in man. 3. because he is infinitely and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond

man, he is most holy: 1. because of the vnion of his humane nature with his diuine. 2. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the fulnes of all grace and holines, which he receiued as man. 3. because he is not
holy onely in himselfe, but sanctifieth and maketh holy his Church. 4. because he was not
of vnholy made holy, as man is, but he was alwaies without sinne, and so alwaies holy, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer.</hi>
to this purpose also <hi>Osiand.</hi> he is called most holy, because in respect of his diuine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
he is <hi>Deus sanctissimus,</hi> the most holy God: and in his humanitie he was without sinne. 2. This title to be called most holy, or holy of holies, is peculiar vnto the Messiah, as to be
called the king of kings, and Lord of Lords. And <hi>Eusebius</hi> obserueth well, that he neuer

                        <p>Three things briefly are to be touched concerning the anointing of Christ; wherewith he
was anointed, in what manner, and whereunto. 1. We doe not read, that Christ was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed
with any externall or materiall oyle or oyntment: but his anointing was by the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

2. For the manner, he was anointed with all graces of the spirit, <hi>abundanter,</hi> aboundantly,
<hi>aboue his fellowes,</hi> Psal. 45. 7. and beyond measure, Ioh. 3. 34. God giueth him not the spirit

                        <p>3. And beside the vncertentie of forren stories, which fell out in the change of three
Monarchies, the Persian, Grecian, and Romane: (for it beeing an hard thing to finde the true
reckoning and computation of yeares in one kingdome, it must needes be more difficult, to
finde a true account in laying together the yeares of diuers Monarchies:) Beside this vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentie,
there are foure other principall difficulties in the prophesie it selfe. 1. when these
70. weekes should beginne. 2. when they determine and haue an ende. 3. whether the
space comming betweene the beginning and ende, consisting of 490. yeares, doth precisely
containe so many, neither more, nor fewer. 4. how all these things, prophesied here of the
Messiah, were fulfilled and accomplished in this limited time. Now notwithstanding these
difficulties, I will proceede by Gods grace, to make some way for the better vnderstanding
of this great mysterie: wherein I will gather together the most probable opinions of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
interpreters, approouing in my iudgement the best.</p>

of our interpreters.</head>
                        <p>The diuers opinions here of writers about the beginning of the seuentie weekes, may be
sorted into three ranks. 1. Some make them to beginne before Cyrus: 2. some pitch
their beginning at Cyrus: 3. and some beginne the reckoning after Cyrus, vnder the raigne
of other Persian kings.</p>
                        <p>1. They which beginne the computation of these yeares before the times of Cyrus: 1.
some count these 70. weekes, by weekes not of seuen yeares, but of tenne times seuen, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
yeare taking tenne, and beginne their reckoning from the beginning of the world: so
that 70. weekes shall make 4900. yeares from the creation of the world vnto Christ: thus
<hi>Origen. hom. 29. in Matth.</hi> 2. Some will haue these weekes take beginning from the 4.
yeare of Zedekiah, 7. yeares before the great captiuitie, which was in the 11. yeare of Zede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiahs
raigne, for then the word, they say, came forth by Ieremie, namely the prophecie and
promise of their deliuerance after 70. yeares, which was in the 4. yeare of Zedekiah: which
they thus gather: Ierem. 29. 10. this prophesie of 70. yeares captiuitie is declared: which
was in the 4. yeare of Zedekiah, c. 28. 1. of this opinion are <hi>Lyranus, Paulus Burgens.</hi> vpon

                           <pb n="295" facs="tcp:18834:148"/>
2. Of the second sort are these. 1. Some will haue them beginne in the first yeare of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,
at the time when this word came vnto Daniel, so <hi>Tertullian lib. aduers. Iudaeos.</hi> and
<hi>Pintus.</hi> 2. some from the time that Cyrus set forth his edict for the peoples returne, as
<hi>Clemens Alexandrin. 1. lib. stromat.</hi> of this opinion are <hi>Calvin, Melancthon, lunius</hi> in the
first edition in his annotations vpon this place: <hi>H. Br.</hi> vpon Daniel: And it shall appeare of
all the rest to be the more probable.</p>
                        <p>3. Concerning those which set the beginning of these weekes after the raigne of Cyrus:
whereas there were three other edicts beside that of Cyrus, which gaue libertie to build the
Temple and citie, which are mentioned, Ezra. 6. 1. Ezra. 7. and Nehem. 2. hereupon, some
thinke that these 70. weekes must be reckoned from the 2. yeare of <hi>Darius Hystaspis,</hi> the
3. king of Persia, so <hi>Eusebius lib. 8. de demonstr. Evang. Cyrillus cateches. 12. Driedo lib.
3. de sacr. Scriptur. c. 5. par. 4. Iansenius c. 122. concord. Euang.</hi> 2. Some take the 20.
yeare of this Darius, <hi>Pellican.</hi> 3. Some count from <hi>Xerxes</hi> the 4. king of Persia, whom <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus</hi>
thinketh to haue sent Ezra in the 7. yeare of his raigne: <hi>ex Bulling.</hi> 4. Some take the
seuenth yeare of <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus</hi> the fift king: which opinion <hi>Pererius</hi> ascribeth
to <hi>Theodoret,</hi> so also <hi>Bullinger</hi> holdeth, and <hi>Pap.</hi> 5. Some appoint the 20. yeare of <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xerxes
Longimanus,</hi> when Nehemiah was sent with a newe commission, Nehem. 2. so <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome,
Beda, Africanus, Hugo, Pererius, Osiander:</hi> whereas this was <hi>Artaxerxes Mnc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
the seuenth king, not <hi>Longimanus,</hi> the fift king of Persia, that sent Nehemiah. 6. Some
doe beginne the account, the second yeare of <hi>Darius Nothus,</hi> so called because he was a
bastard, the sixt king of Persia, so <hi>Iunius</hi> in his commentarie vpon Daniel. <hi>Ios. Scallig. l. 6.
de emend. temp. Polan. Edw. Liuely</hi> in his Persian Monarchie. 7. Lastly, <hi>Apollinaris</hi> long
after these, counteth the beginning of the 70. weekes, from the time of Christs birth and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie:
So in all there are in effect tenne seuerall opinions, about the beginning these weeks.</p>
                        <p>As touching the ende and determination of these yeares, there are likewise diuerse
opinions. 1. Some thinke that 69. of these weekes expired at such time as <hi>Pompey</hi>
tooke Ierusalem, and entred into the Temple, slaying such as sacrificed, presuming e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to the most holy place, and ende the last weeke in <hi>Traian</hi> the Emperour, vntill which
time the preaching of the Apostles continued, <hi>Iohn</hi> surviuing euen vnto the raigne of the
Emperour <hi>Traian, Eusebius.</hi> 2. Some beginning these weekes in the 6. yeare of <hi>Darius
Hystaspis,</hi> doe ende them at such time as <hi>Herod</hi> vsurped the kingdome, <hi>Oecolamp.</hi> consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with <hi>Eusebius.</hi> 3. Some doe determine these yeares in the natiuitie and birth of Christ,
of this opinion <hi>Hierome</hi> reporteth <hi>Origen</hi> to haue beene, <hi>lib. 10. stromat.</hi> so also <hi>Ioannes
Driedo, Iansenius, Melancthon.</hi> 4. Many drawe these yeares, in the passion of Christ, as <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gensis,
Vatablus, Petrus Galatinus,</hi> beginne these yeares, in the fourth yeare of <hi>Zedekiah,</hi>
and ende them in the passion of Christ: so <hi>Beda, Africanus,</hi> beginning at the 20. of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes,</hi>
ende at the passion of Christ. 5. Some ende them in the 4. yeare after the passion
of Christ, as <hi>Lyranus,</hi> who reckoneth them from the 20. yeare of king <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> vnto the
4. yeare, supposing the Messiah to haue suffred in the middes of the last propheticall weeke:
so also <hi>Ioannes Lucidus, Pintus.</hi> 6. Some referre the ende of these weekes to the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on of Ierusalem by <hi>Titus,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian, Chrsyostome, Clemens Alexandrin.</hi> and of the newe
writers, <hi>Iunius, Scalliger, Polanus, Liuely.</hi> 7. Some determine them after the passion of
Christ, extending them to the finall destruction of the citie vnder <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperour, as
some of the Hebrewes. 8. Some will haue these weekes reach vnto the ende of the world
to the comming of Antichrist: as <hi>Apollinaris,</hi> who beginneth them at the natiuitie of Christ,
and continueth them to the ende of the world.</p>
                        <p>Thus are interpreters diuersely carried in the interpretation of these propheticall weekes:
which afterward shall in their order be examined. Hereupon the Iewes, as namely cauilling
<hi>Barbinel,</hi> to annihilate this prophesie, obiect the difference and dissention of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
about the meaning thereof: But it may be answeared, 1. that the diuersitie of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
among interpreters, doth not evacuate or extenuate the authoritie of Scripture, <hi>Calvin.</hi>
2. Though in the particular account of time, there be some disagreement, yet herein most
Christian interpreters agree, that all these yeares expired, either in the birth or passion of
Christ, or in the destruction of Ierusalem. So that which account soeuer be receiued, two
maine points are prooued against the Iewes: one that the Messiah is come, the other that
he came not as a glorious or victorious temporall Prince, as the Iewes imagine, but he
was slaine by them, and put to death, <hi>Pappus.</hi> 3. This obiection may be retorted
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:18834:149"/>
vpon themselues: for euen there is great dissention among their owne Rabbines: <hi>Ab. Ez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>
holdeth there were but sowre kings of Persia, <hi>R. Moses</hi> saith there were fiue, <hi>R. Saa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ah</hi>
three onely: So they also differ about their yeares: <hi>Ab. Ezra</hi> holdeth the Persian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie
to haue continued 61. yeares: <hi>Abraham Dauison,</hi> but 51. the most of the Hebrewes
giue but 50. yeares to the Persian Monarchie, <hi>Ed. Liuely,</hi> p. 34. And in many other points
are the Rabbines diuided in opinion: so that herein they may forbeare to obiect vnto the
Christians their dissension. 4. And thus may the obiection of the Gentiles be answered,
which take exception to the Christians, because of their dissension and difference in this and
other points: as <hi>Iosephus</hi> giueth instance of the dissensions of the heathen historians among
themselues, <hi>In quot locis Hellanicus de genealogijs &amp; temporibus ab Acusilao discrepat, &amp;c.</hi>
in how many places doth <hi>Hellanicus</hi> differ from <hi>Acusilaus</hi> concerning genealogies and
times: and in how many doth <hi>Acusilaus</hi> correct <hi>Hesiodus: Ephorus</hi> in many things findeth
<hi>Hellanicus</hi> to be deceiued: and <hi>Timeus, Ephorus:</hi> and <hi>Timeus,</hi> those that followed him: and
all <hi>Herodotus:</hi> thus <hi>Ioseph. contra Appion.</hi>

yeares.</head>
                        <p>1. First, the computation which the Hebrewes follow is verie imperfect and vncertaine,
and worthie of small credit concerning the Persian Monarchie: for they make but fowre
kings of Persia, <hi>Cyrus, Cambyses, Assuerus, Darius,</hi> and generally hold, that the Persian
Monarchie continued not aboue 50. yeares: whereas beside these there is euident mention
made of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> or <hi>Artashasht,</hi> and of the 32. yeare of his raigne, Nehem. 5. 14. But
to remooue this doubt, <hi>Ab. Ezra</hi> will haue <hi>Assuerus</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> to be all one: yet <hi>R.
Moses</hi> maketh them two sundrie kings, and so thinketh that there were fiue in all: so well
the Rabbines agree together.</p>
                        <p>2. There is an other chronicle, which <hi>Annius Viterbiens.</hi> hath set forth vnder the names
of the auncient writers, <hi>Berosus, Manethon, Metasthones, Philo:</hi> who numbreth but 8.
kings of the Persians, and giueth vnto that whole Empire 191. yeares: But as in other things
that Chronologie is found to be false and imperfect, as <hi>Pererius</hi> hath shewed at large in his
11. booke vpon Daniel: as namely, in this that he maketh <hi>Philo,</hi> in a certaine, booke called
the <hi>Breuiarie,</hi> to affirme that the posteritie of <hi>Salomon</hi> ended in <hi>Achazia,</hi> and that <hi>Ioas,</hi>
which succeeded was not the sonne of <hi>Achazia,</hi> but descended of <hi>Nathan:</hi> whereas it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
set downe, 1. Chron. 3. 11. that <hi>Ioas</hi> was the sonne of <hi>Achazia:</hi> beside this, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
such slippes, this apparant error is committed in the Persian Monarchie, that reckoning
but 8. kings, he omitteth three which were most famous among them, namely, <hi>Cambyses,
Darius Hystaspis,</hi> and <hi>Xerxes,</hi> whom to denie to haue beene kings of Persia were all one, as
to say, that <hi>Augustus</hi> and <hi>Tiberius</hi> were not Emperours of Rome.</p>
                        <p>3. There is an other way to make this account, by setting downe the yeares of the seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
kings of Persia, and so of the Grecians: but there is also small certaintie of this: for that
the seuerall yeares of diuerse kings in three Monarchies, cannot certainely be gathered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the change and alteration of the state and kingdome, and many times there was an
<hi>interregnum,</hi> or intermission of the gouernement: and some kings raigned onely certaine
moneths: so that the time of one king ranne within the account of an others raigne.</p>
                        <p>4. Beside the Hebrewes haue an other kind of reckoning, by the yeares of their high
Priests, which succeeded one another vnto the time of Herod, vnder whom Christ was
borne: which account seemeth <hi>Montanus</hi> to followe in his <hi>apparatus,</hi> in the treatise called
<hi>Daniel:</hi> the whole summe there gathered from the first of Cyrus to the birth of Christ is
433. yeares or thereabout: But this account must needes be more vncertaine, then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
by the yeares of the kings, especially in those tumultuous and troublesome times after
the Macchabees, when the high priesthood was bought and sold.</p>
                        <p>5. We come now vnto the Romane co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>putation, which was accounted these two waies, by
the yeares from the first building of Rome, &amp; afterward by their Consulls: But seeing Rome
was of no great reputation, while the Persian and Grecian Monarchie stood, neither of these
accounts can giue any certaine direction concerning the affaires of those kingdomes: And
thus much <hi>Plutarke</hi> confesseth in the life of <hi>Camillus,</hi> hauing declared the receiued opinion,
that Rome was taken by the French about the 360. yeare of the city<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                           <hi>if it seeme credible</hi> (saith
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:18834:149"/>
he) <hi>that an exact account of these times, had beene so long preserued seeing that euen the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
of that time, hath brought some doubt and controuersie to the latter:</hi> And he giueth this
reason of his doubt, because the common opinion was, that the taking of the citie was in
the 365. yeare of Rome, and the first of the 98. Olympiad but whereas the fame of that
warre was spread abroad in Greece, and came to the hearing of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and <hi>Heraclides
Ponticus,</hi> who liued in the time of <hi>Philip</hi> king of Macedon, who raigned about the 105.
Olympiad, this warre falleth out 27. yeares after the vsuall reckoning:<note place="margin">In his Persian Monarchie, pag. 125.</note> 
                           <hi>M. Liuely</hi> to salue
the credit of the Latine computation, saith, that there were two battels made by the French,
and it was the latter of them, the report whereof came to <hi>Aristotles</hi> hearing: But it is like,
that <hi>Plutarke</hi> would not haue omitted this matter, to haue made sound the Romane Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologie:
and it was not a battell with the French, but the taking of the citie by them, the
fame whereof was bruited abroad: Beside an other instance may be giuen of the vncertaintie
of the Romane Chronologie: <hi>Plutarke</hi> referreth the beginning of the <hi>Peloponne siake</hi> warre
in Greece, to the 300, yeare of the building of Rome, 3. <hi>booke. c.</hi> 1. whereas <hi>Aulus Gelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.
l. 71. c.</hi> 21. bringeth it to the 329. yeare: <hi>M. Liuely</hi> here answeareth, that <hi>vigesimum
nonum, twentie nine,</hi> by the slippe of the writers penne, is put for <hi>decimum nonum, ninteene,</hi>
p. 105. whereas, beside that there is small affinitie, betweene these two words, <hi>vigesimum,</hi>
and <hi>decimum,</hi> that one lightly by the writer could not be taken for an other, yet this beeing
admitted, there remaineth still the oddes of 19. or 20. yeares, which is a great difference
in the storie of times. As great vncertaintie there is in reckoning by the yeares of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls:
as <hi>Senerus Sulpitius lib. 2. sacr. histor,</hi> saith, that Christ was borne, when <hi>Sabinus</hi> and
<hi>Ruffinus</hi> were Consuls: <hi>Cassiodorus,</hi> when <hi>Cneus Lentulus,</hi> and <hi>Marcus Messala</hi> were col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues

and <hi>Marcus Plautius Sylvanus.</hi> So <hi>Augustine</hi> thinketh that Christ died that yeare, when

the other in the 19. yeares, whereas Christ suffred in the 18. yeare of <hi>Tiberius:</hi> And
further, there is great vncertaintie thoroughout the Romane Chronologie of the Consuls,
that in the space of 700. yeares, there is hardly one yeare to be found, wherein the histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
agree who should be Consuls: <hi>Liuius, Cassiodorus, Sulpitius, Dio, Diodorus Siculus,</hi>
the Capitoline tables, that were digged vp out of the ground vnder <hi>Paulus</hi> the 3. <hi>ann.</hi> 46.
composed as it is thought by <hi>Verrius Flaccus,</hi> doe all differ one from another, concerning
the names of the yearely Consuls; as is extant in the Romane Chronologie, collected out of
diuers authors by <hi>Ioachimus Grellius</hi> ioyned vnto <hi>Livies</hi> historie.</p>
                        <p>6. There remaineth then the Greeke reckonings by their Olympiads, which were certen
games of running, wrestling, leaping, celebrated euerie 4. yeare about Iuly in Greece, in a
certaine place called <hi>Olympia</hi> so called, because there <hi>Hercules</hi> first instituted these solemne
games to the honour of <hi>Iuppiter Olympius:</hi> which beeing discontinued a long time, were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
renewed by <hi>Iuphitus</hi> king of that countrey, about 705. yeares before the birth of Christ,
and so continued a 1000. yeares after: This account by the Olympiads is resolued vpon to
be the best by <hi>Pererius, M. Linely, Bullinger,</hi> and others: whereof now followeth more in
the next question.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div n="36" type="question">
                        <head>Quest. 36. Whether the account of the Olympiake yeares be a certaine
direction for the vnderstanding of Daniels weekes.</head>
                        <p>1. Here are three opinions to be discussed. 1. Some, as the Hebrewes, doe vtterly reiect
the Greekes Olympiads, making no account of them. 2. Some doe make them the onely
helpe, and key to vnlocke the shut vp and hid meaning of Daniels weekes, <hi>Liuely p.</hi> 36. So
<hi>Bullinger, certissimae sunt omnium supputationes, quae fiunt per Olympiades,</hi> the supputations
made by the Olympiades are of all other most certaine, &amp;c. and <hi>Pererius</hi> calleth it, <hi>chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiam
omnium certissimam,</hi> the chronologie of all other most certaine. 3. But the meane
opinion betweene these is the best, that there is small certaintie in the Olympiades concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Persian Monarchie, though for the Greeke affaires that computation may safely be
receiued: and this is the iudgement of <hi>M. Calvin, hoc non potest certo trahi ad imperium
Persarum,</hi> this computation by the Olympike yeares (howsoeuer it may serue for the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans)
yet it cannot be applyed to the Persian Empire, to know therby at what time the kings
of Persia beganne and ended their raigne, &amp;c. So the Olympike reckoning in part is to be
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:18834:150"/>
receiued, in part it is so small certaintie.</p>
                        <p>1. Conceruing the first of these opinions, that no respect is at all to be had to the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympiake
yeares, which is the fansie of the Hebrewes, it is vtterly to be misliked: for after
the ende of the propheticall writings, the Scriptures beeing altogether silent, what directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
will they haue especially for forren histories? <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> here resolueth well, that <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the citie Ierusalem was repaired, iam desicientibus Prophetis cum Malachia &amp; Ezra,</hi> 
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>
Prophets then ending with Malachie and Ezra, there is no credit to be giuen vnto the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes
in the supputation of their yeares. 2. Neither is the second opinion generally to be
receiued, that the computation of this time is altogether to be directed, and in a manner
ouerruled by the Olympiake reckoning: Here first the arguments shall be examined, which
are brought for the certaine authoritie of the Olympiads, and then some contrarie reasons
shall be produced, to shewe the inualiditie of them.</p>
                        <p>1. As touching the names and number of the Persian kings, that the certaintie thereof
may be gathered from the Greeks, it is thus argued: because many excellent writers, and
learned men, Philosophers, and Historiographers liued vnder the kings of Persia, and knew
their affaires; as the seuen wisemen of Greece, <hi>Thales, Solon, Chilon, Pittacus, Bias, Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus,
Periander,</hi> liued in the time of <hi>Cyrus: Pythagoras, Zenophanes, Anaximander, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclitus,</hi>
with others, flourished vnder <hi>Cambyses,</hi> and <hi>Darius: Socrates, Thucidides, Euripi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>
vnder <hi>Artaxerxes:</hi> Beside the courts of the Persian kings were frequented by many
noble Grecians, as by <hi>Hippias, Demaratus, Miltiades:</hi> and therefore the names and number
of the Persian kings, was well knowne to them of Greece: thus <hi>M. Liuely</hi> from pag. 43. to
pag. 46. But this is no sufficient argument for the matter in question. 1. It followeth not,
though these learned Philosophers and historians liued in the time of the Persian kings, and
some of them frequented their Courts, that therefore they had a certaine knowledge of
them all. These kings of Persia, with whom the Grecians had to doe, were knowne vnto
them: but neither all of them, nor yet to all those forenamed Philosophers and writers were
they exactly knowne. 2. An euident instance hereof may be giuen in <hi>Xenophon,</hi> who wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
that <hi>Cyrus</hi> died in his bed, and made a wise exhortation to his children, whereas it is
generally receiued, that he was slaine by <hi>Tomyris,</hi> as <hi>Iustine</hi> writeth. 3. And though the
name and number of the Persian kings had beene knowne to the Grecians, yet the yeares
of their raigne they much regarded not, because they beeing a vaine-glorious nation, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their owne Olympike reckoning.</p>
                        <p>2. Now for the truth and certaintie of the Olympiads one demonstration is taken from
the time when Cyrus beganne his raigne, which was in the 55. Olympiad, from whence to
the 114. Olympiad, when <hi>Alexander</hi> died, are counted 236. yeares, whereof 6. yeares must
be allowed to the Empire of Alexander after he ouercame Darius, so <hi>M. Liuely,</hi> pag. 48.
and <hi>Pererius lib. 11. quest.</hi> 2. But this demonstration may be thus excepted against. 1. <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
Alexand.</hi> placeth the destruction of the temple which was in the 19. yeare of Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar,
in the last yeare of the 47. Olympiad, <hi>lib. 1. stromat.</hi> the 55. Olympiad fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
iust 30. yeares after: if then Cyrus beganne to raigne, how shall the 70. yeares of the
Babylonian captiuitie be made vp, which beganne in the 8. yeare of Nebuchadnezzar, with
the captiuitie of Iechoniah: or if we beginne the captiuitie in the 4. yeare, when Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar
tooke Ierusalem, in the raigne of Iehoiachim, 2. king. 24. 2. there will not arise by
this account 50. yeares in all for the captuitie. 2. <hi>Pererius</hi> beginneth the first Olympiad in
the 8. yeare of the raigne of Ahaz: (and yet some beginne the Olympiads in the 2. yeare of
<hi>Iotham</hi> who raigned 16. yeares, that is, 23. yeares before that, <hi>Bullinger.</hi>) then cannot Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus
raigne be referred to the 55. Olympiad, for the distance betwene the 1. and 55. Olympi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad,
maketh 216. yeares: but there onely were expired, 205. yeares: as it may be thus gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
from the 8. yeare of Ahaz vnto the 11. yeare of Iehoiachim, when Iechonias captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
began, are an 135. yeares, and from thence to Cyrus 70. yeares, which make 205. yeares,
then must the beginning of Cyrus raigne be pulled backe an 11. yeares from the 55. Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piad
to the 2. of the 52. Olympiad.</p>
                        <p>3. An other demonstration is taken from comparing the Olympike yeares with the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of Rome:<note place="margin">Persian Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, p. 75.</note> 
                           <hi>M. Liuely</hi> out of <hi>Dyonisius Halycarnasseus</hi> his 5. booke alleadgeth that the
31. yeare of <hi>Darius Hystaspis,</hi> concurred with the 72. Olympiad, and 262. yeare of Rome.
This account is iust if we begin the Olympiads in the second yeare of <hi>Iotham,</hi> for Rome is
held to haue beene builded in the first of the 7. Olympiad, which was in the tenth yeare of
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:18834:150"/>
                           <hi>Achaz:</hi> but <hi>Pererius</hi> bringeth the 7. Olympiad to the sixteenth yeare of Hezekiah, 23. years
after, so that by his reckoning the 31. of Darius shall fall out 23. yeares later, about the 4.
yeare of the 77. <hi>Olympiad.</hi> And further, how well the Greeke Olympiads and the yeares
of the bonding of Rome agree together, appeareth by the dissension of writers in what O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympiad
Rome should first be founded: <hi>Timeus Siculus</hi> thinketh that Rome was built at the
same time, that Carthage was in <hi>Africa</hi> by the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> which was 38. yeare before the first
Olympiad. <hi>Titus Liuius, Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> and <hi>Solinus</hi> set the building of Rome in
the 4. yeare of the 6. Olympiad: <hi>Pomponius Atticus, Cicero, Plinie,</hi> with others, in the 3.
yeare of the same Olympiad: <hi>Dyonisius Halycarnass. Eratosthenes, Theophilus, Antiochenus,</hi>
in the 1. yeare of the 7. Olympiad. <hi>Polybius, Diod. Siculus,</hi> in the 2. yeare of the 7. Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piad.
<hi>Q. Fabius</hi> an ancient writer of the Romane affaires,<note place="margin">

<hi>L. Cincius</hi> in the 4. yeare of the 12. Olympiad: The oddes betweene the first account and
the last is aboue 80. yeares: for 12. Olympiads make 48. yeares, and some thinke that Rome
was founded 38. yeares before the first Olympiad: some not before the 4. yeare of the 12.
Olympiad.</p>
                        <p>4. But yet a more euident proofe is taken from the course of the Sunne, which was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipsed
in the 7. yeare of <hi>Cambyses,</hi> which was in the second yeare of the 64. Olympiad:
there was an other eclipse, which happened an eleuen dayes before <hi>Alexanders</hi> last battel
with Darius, in the sixt yeare of his raigne: betweene these two eclipses there are found by
exact calculation, an 192. yeares, which with Cyrus 30. and Cambyses 7. yeares make 229.
which was the full time of the Persian Monarchie: And hereupon he concludeth thus, <hi>thus
the glorious seruant of the world the Sunne, &amp;c. euen this Chronologer I say, of all other with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
exception most true and sure, witnesseth for Herodotus, Thucydides, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. Indeede, if all these supposalls were true, that these two eclipses happened
in those yeares, to the which they are assigned, and that such distance were found betweene
them, and <hi>Cyrus</hi> with <hi>Cambyses</hi> raigned so long, the conclusion for that continuance of the
Persian Monarchie were verie strong: but all these are vncertaine, first that <hi>Cambyses</hi> and
<hi>Cyrus</hi> raigned so long, 37. yeares betweene them: <hi>Iunius</hi> giueth vnto them together but 9.
yeares: <hi>Bullinger</hi> 14. yeares: secondly, whether such an eclipse fell out in the raigne of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byses,</hi>
and not rather afore, may be likewise doubted: thirdly, whether that distance were not
rather taken betweene two other eclipses then these, it likewise may be a question: he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of an other eclypse which was an 141. yeares after that, supposed to be in <hi>Cambyses</hi>
time, which <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> placeth in the 2. of the 99. Olympiad. 2. But although the
Sunne be most sure in his course, there is a Sunne which is more true and stedfast, euen the
Sunne-light of the truth which shineth in the Scriptures, and in this prophesie of Daniel,
which calculateth but 490. yeares from the word going forth, which was the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> vnto the Messiah, which time cannot be iustly gathered, if 200. yeares or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
be giuen to the Persians: Now on the contrarie side this may be obiected against the
certaintie of the Olympiads.</p>
                        <p>1. Seeing it is confessed, that the Olympike games, were first erected by <hi>Hercules,</hi> and
then discontinued a long time vntill <hi>Iphitus,</hi> who renewed them, is it not as likely, that they
might be interrupted afterward, as before? and the rather because of the great warres which
the Grecians had with the Persians, and the <hi>Peloponnesiake</hi> ciuill warre, which continued
27. yeares among themselues: in which troublesome times it may be supposed, they had no
great leasure or desire to solemnize their Olympike games, all Grecia beeing in an vproare.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Plutark</hi> in the life of <hi>Numa,</hi> maketh some doubt of the Olympike reckonings in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the beginning thereof beeing committed to writing verie late by <hi>Hippias</hi> of <hi>Elis:</hi>
to this it is answered, that although <hi>Hippias</hi> should beginne the Olympiads somewhat too
late: as put the case that he make that the 40. Olympiad, which was but the thirtieth, yet
the distances of time betweene the Olympiads shall not misse one lotte: so <hi>Temporanus,</hi> and
<hi>M. Liuely, pag.</hi> 89. But howsoeuer the distances and spaces of time may be kept, yet there
must needes be a manifest error in the computation, if those things be referred to a later
time, which were formerly done: As the question beeing of the beginning of the Persian
Monarchie, if it be set at the 55. Olympiad, when it beganne much sooner, a great error
will fall out in historie, and one error admitted in chronicle will breed many.</p>
                        <p>3. It is vncertaine when the Olympiades beganne: <hi>Bullinger</hi> holdeth they beganne in the
2. yeare of <hi>Iotham,</hi> and <hi>M. Liuely</hi> seemeth to be of the same opinion, who maketh the 31.
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:18834:151"/>
yeare of <hi>Darius Hystaspis,</hi> and the 72. Olympiad to concurre together, which cannot be,
vnlesse he beginne the Olympiads in the 2. of <hi>Iotham,</hi> as is euidently scene in <hi>Bullingers</hi> first
and third Chronicle table, <hi>Eusebius</hi> beginneth the Olympiads in the 49. yeare of <hi>Azaria,
Glareanus</hi> in the 50. <hi>Lucidus</hi> in the 46. yeare, <hi>Paulus Phrygio</hi> in the 12. of <hi>Iotham, Biblian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
in the 13. <hi>Functius</hi> in the 2. of <hi>Iotham:</hi> so also <hi>Africanus,</hi> which seemeth the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable:
But <hi>Pererius</hi> setteth the beginning of the Olympiades 23. yeares after, in the 8. yeare
of <hi>Achaz,</hi> as is shewed before.</p>
                        <p>4. If forren writers be compared together, great difference will be found in the account
of yeares by the Olympiads, as this one instance here may suffice concerning the time
wherein <hi>Pythagoras</hi> liued: <hi>Dyonisius</hi> saith he taught in Italie about the 50. Olympiad: <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ogenes
Laertius</hi> writeth that he flourished in the 60. Olympiad: here is a distance of 40.
yeares: <hi>Solinus</hi> bringeth him to the time of the first Consuls, which was about the 68. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympiad:
but <hi>Plinie</hi> putteth him backe an 100. yeares, from the time assigned by <hi>Solinus:</hi>
the like difference in other matters may appeare by diligent search in forren historians, in
the reckoning of the Olympike yeares: The like difference is found among the Christians
in the Olympike reckoning: <hi>Cyrillus chateches.</hi> 12. placeth Christs birth in the 186. Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piad:
<hi>Ioseph. Scallig.</hi> and <hi>M. Liuely,</hi> in the 3. yeare of the 194. Olympiad: <hi>Pererius,</hi> and
the most beside, in the 4. yeare of the 194. Olympiad.</p>
                        <p>5. But the chiefe obiection of all is, that the Olympian account agreeth not with the
Scripture: for if Nehemiah saw both the beginning of the Persian Monarchie, as is euident,
Ezra. 2. 2. he was one of those which returned from the captiuitie according to the edict
of <hi>Cyrus:</hi> and liued to see the ende of that Monarchie, as he maketh mention of Darius the
last king of Persia, vnder whom <hi>Iaddua</hi> was high Priest, who met Alexander, who is also
named in the same place, Nehem. 12. 22. then could not the Persian Monarchie continue
230. yeares, as is gathered by the Olympike computation: for then Nehemiah, who may be
supposed to haue beene 20. yeare old when he returned from Chaldea, should be, 250 yeare
old, which age was not incident into those times: But this shall be shewed more at large
afterward: This shall suffice concerning the Olympike supputation of yeares.</p>
                        <p>3. Now the third opinion remaineth, propounded in the begnning of this question: that
the Olympike computation may be admitted concerning the affaires of the Greekes, and
the continuance of their Monarchie, as of the Kings of Syria, and Egypt: but they can giue
no certaine direction concerning the kings of Persia, the yeares of their raigne, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of their Empire. To know then the certaintie hereof, first, we must haue recourse vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the sacred historie: forren historians are so to be followed, as that no contradiction be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Scriptures: then where the Scripture leaueth vs, forren witnesses are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued:
Now seeing it is collected that the raigne of the Grecians from Alexander vnto <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opatra</hi>
Q. of Egypt, continued about 300. yeares, and from thence to the death of Christ the
Romanes ruled 60. yeares, <hi>H. Br. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>roleg. in Daniel,</hi> there can remaine but an 130. yeares
for the Monarchie of the Persians, to make vp the summe of Daniels 70. weekes, that is,
490. yeares. So then thus farre we are directed by the holy storie, as is shewed before by
the age and life of Nehemias, who sawe the beginning and ende of the Persian Monarchie,
that it could not continue 200. yeares or aboue, the rest must be supplied out of the Greeke
and Latine historians.</p>
                        <p>Here then two erroneous opinions are to be touched, the one of <hi>Varro,</hi> who vntill the
beginning of the Olympiads, holdeth no certainty of time to be gathered: for he distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the age of the world into these 3. times, before the flood, which he saith is altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne,
after the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

number of yeares.</head>
                        <p>This may be prooued by sundrie reasons, against their opinion, who doe thinke, that in
this number of Daniels weekes, there is not signified a precise tearme of yeares, but general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
all that time, which should follow vnto the comming of the Messiah. But that a certen
and definite number of yeares is signified and intended by these 70. weekes, it may thus be
shewed.</p>
                        <p>1. That number of yeares whose beginning and ende is expressed, must needes be a defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
and certen number, beeing so bounded and limited: but the beginning and ende of this
tearme is described: they take beginning at the going forth of the word, and they ende at
the Messiah.</p>
                        <p>2. The manner of phrase declareth as much, 70. weekes are cut out, or determined: the
Lord had as it were cut out, seuered, and appointed this time for the comming of the Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,
to performe these things here prophesied.</p>
                        <p>3. That number is definite and certen, which is diuided into parts: but so is this whole
number of 70. weekes: it is diuided into three parts, into 7. weekes, 62. weekes, and one
weeke.</p>
                        <p>4. This number of 70. weekes answereth vnto the tearme of 70. yeares, beeing that
number multiplied 7. times: therefore as the one is certen, so is the other.</p>
                        <p>5. Further that time, which we are bid to obserue and marke, and to attend such things
as fall out therein, must be a certen and definite time; for how els should it be obserued and
marked: but such was this time here designed by Daniel, and the euents which followed it,
as our Sauiour saith, Mar. 24. 15. <hi>When ye shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by

the whole time from the first to the second Adam, is not much aboue 4000. yeares, not yet
so much in some account: so that this time, according to <hi>Origens</hi> supputation, will exceede
the time of the Messiah almost 900. yeares. 3. It is euident that these 70. weekes must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne
at such time, as the word went forth to build againe Ierusalem and the Temple; they
must not then take beginning so long before. 4. Neither are they to be extended vnto the

that these weekes must then beginne, when the people returned out of captiuitie. 2. from
thence vnto the Messiah are 490. yeares: but if we should beginne fiftie yeares before, the

all the time of the captiuitie, added to Daniels propheticall weekes. 2. if they will fetch the
beginning from that word and promise, why may they not as well beginne an eleuen yeares
before, when Ieremie in the 4. yeare of Iehoiakim shewed them of the captiuitie of 70.
yeares, Ierem. 25. 1. 11? or yet they may beginne further off from that promise made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Cyrus, Isa. 45. that he should cause Ierusalem to be builded againe: from which time
to the ende of Daniels weekes are aboue 700. yeares.</p>
                        <p>Likewise <hi>R. Salamons</hi> opinion is confuted by the same reasons: who beginneth the 70.
weekes from the first destruction of the Temple in the 19. yeare of Nebuchadnezzer, and
endeth them at the destruction of the citie: for 1. so there will be found aboue 50. yeares
more then the 70. weekes from the destruction of the Temple vnto the going forth of the
commandement, to build againe Ierusalem. 2. seeing the Angel pitcheth the beginning
at the going forth of the word <hi>to bring againe the people, and to build againe Ierusalem,</hi> it is
absurd to set the beginning, when the people were carried into captiuitie, and the citie and

chapter, v. 6, 7. two kings of the Persians after Cyrus, Assuerus and Artashasht: then after
them followed Darius: But Darius the sonne of Hystaspis, was the third king of Persia. 2.
In Darius decree, mentioned Ezr. 6. there is no speach of building the citie, but of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

that Ezra was sent to Ierusalem by <hi>Artaxerxes.</hi> 2. that Nehemiah liuing vnto <hi>Alexanders</hi>

reforme the manners of the people, and to set them in order, not to build the citie or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and therefore it was not <hi>the going forth of the word,</hi> here spoken of, which was to build

but it is not like that the building of the Temple, beeing the most speciall thing which the
people of God longed after, should be excluded out of the compasse of the 70. weekes.</p>
                        <p>5. Their opinion also may be refelled, who count the beginning of these 70. weekes
from the 2. yeare of <hi>Darius Nothus,</hi> when by the commandement of the king the building
of the house went forward, and was finished in the sixt yeare, Ezr. 6. 15. from thence to the
destruction of Ierusalem, are found iust 490. yeares: the particulars whereof <hi>Polanus</hi> thus
gathereth: from the 2. of <hi>Darius Nothus</hi> to the death of <hi>Alexander,</hi> are yeares 99. from
thence to the destruction of Ierusalem, 391. which make 490. yeares.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. In the place giuen in instance, Ezr. 6. 14. it is said, <hi>they builded and finished the
house, by the appointment of God, and by the commandement of Cyrus, and Darius, and Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shasht
king of Persia:</hi> seeing then, that all these gaue commandement for the building of
the Temple, from which of them rather must the account beginne, then from the first? for
they onely finished the worke of the Temple now: it could not be begunne and made an
ende of in foure yeares. 2. Neither is his computation of yeares certaine and agreed vpon:
for some beginne to account from the 3. yeare of Darius Nothus, <hi>M. Lively,</hi> p. 216. <hi>Iunius</hi>
reckoneth but 98. yeares from the 2. of <hi>Nothus</hi> to the death of <hi>Alexander:</hi> further in this
reckoning, counting 70. yeares from the birth of Christ, to the destruction of the citie, 33.
and an halfe to his passion, and 36. with an halfe afterward, he leaueth in the summe of
391. from Alexanders death 321. yeares for the kingdome of the Greekes and Macchabees,
vnto the 30. yeare of Herod: but others allow not so much: <hi>Melancthon</hi> not much aboue
300. yeares, counting them thus: from Alexanders death to the beginning of the Maccha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees
146. yeares, from thence to Herod 127. yeares, then in the 30. yeare of Herod was
Christ borne: <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> thus maketh vp the reckoning, an 160. yeares from Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
death to the Macchabees, thence to Herod an 127. and 30. yeares of Herod to Christ:
the whole summe is 317. Others recken 300. yeares from the beginning of Alexanders
raigne vnto the raigne of the Roman Empire after <hi>Cleopatra</hi> her 22. yeares, and from thence
to the death of Christ 60. yeares: so <hi>Africanus,</hi> as <hi>Lyranus</hi> citeth him, and <hi>H. Br.</hi> in his <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leg.
in Dan.</hi> Therefore the computation of <hi>Polanus</hi> is not so certaine to be builded vpon.</p>
                        <p>6. Concerning the last opinion of <hi>Apollinaris,</hi> who beginneth to count the 70. weekes at
the birth of Christ, it neede no long refutation: for then there went forth no word for the
building of the citie: and there must be 7. weekes and 62. weekes before the Messiah; so that
he beginneth Daniels weekes, where they almost ende.</p>

                        <p>There remaine then onely to be examined the opinions of the third sort of those, which
beginne the account of the 70. weekes from <hi>Darius</hi> and <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who raigned together. <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi>

taketh the same beginning, but goeth no further then the natiuitie of Christs so also
<hi>Melancthon</hi> in his first account. The Hebrewes, making the same beginning, doe extend

beginneth from <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and endeth in the subuersion of Ierusalem, <hi>lib. 1. stromat. Origen</hi>
doth ende them too soone, and the rest extend them too farre: but touching the ende of

right of these weekes, from the edict of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who raigned together with <hi>Darius</hi> the
Mede, it may thus euidently be prooued.</p>
                        <p>1. First, when the seuentie yeares of captiuitie were expired, the 70. weekes of libertie
immediatly beganne, as <hi>M. Calvin</hi> sheweth vpon the 24. verse, <hi>Certum est quinquaginta an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos
&amp; quinquaginta hebdomadas simul coniungi,</hi> the 70. yeares and 70. weekes are ioyned

2. Chron. 36. 22. therefore then the 70. weekes beganne.</p>
                        <p>2. The 70. weekes beganne from the going forth of the word to cause the people to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,
v. 25. but in the first yeare of <hi>Cyrus</hi> the Edict came forth for the returne of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

                        <p>3. <hi>Paulus Burgensis</hi> vrgeth this reason, that if the beginning of these weekes were su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spended
an hundred yeares to the raigne of <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus,</hi> or after, then it would
follow, that Daniel was ignorant when these weekes should beginne, and so consequently
did not know the time of the comming of the Messiah: but it is not like, that so great a
Prophet, hauing reuealed vnto him the time of the comming of the Messiah, should be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Pererius</hi> to this maketh a double answer. 1. that though Daniel haue a vision in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
of the Messiahs comming, yet he might be ignorant of the very time: as it was reuealed
to Daniel, that one should rise vp to afflict the people of God most grieuously 2300. daies,
chap. 8. yet he knew not the particular time. 2. It is like that it was reuealed to Daniel,
when these 70. weekes should beginne, though it is not expressed in Scripture.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. There is not the like reason to know the particular time of Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
and of Antichrist: there was more necessitie for the comfort of Gods people of the
one, then of the other: neither was the time foretold of <hi>Antiochus</hi> comming, as here of
Christs, but onely how long his tyrannie should continue, when he was come. 2. Such vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written
directions not expressed in Scripture, it is dangerous to imagine: it is true that Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel
knew the beginning of these weekes, and had thereto direction, and that here expressed

to make vp the summe of 490. an 130. yeares for the Persian Monarchie, and not aboue: the
reason is this, because Nehemiah saw both the beginning and the ende of the Persian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie:
that he saw the ende, <hi>Iosephus Scalliger</hi> thus prooueth. 1. because Nehemiah in
his storie maketh mention of the last <hi>Darius,</hi> whome Alexander ouercame, c. 12. 22. And
that it was the last Darius is euident, because <hi>Iaddua</hi> the high Priest is there mentioned, who
met Alexander. 2. Nehemiah was hindred in repairing the walls of the citie by one <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballat,</hi>

souldiers, and died before Alexander had taken Gaza: so that Nehemiah and Samballat
were both of the same time. 3. Nehemiah maketh mention, c. 13. 28. of one of the sonnes
of Ioiada the high Priest, who was the sonne in law of Samballat the <hi>Horonite,</hi> whome Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah
chased away: this, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> sheweth, <hi>lib.</hi> 11. was Manasses the brother of Iaddua
the high Priest, who married <hi>Nicaso</hi> the daughter of Samballat. 4. Nehemiah also maketh
mention of the last <hi>Darius</hi> called <hi>Codomannus,</hi> Nehem. 12. Now that Nehemiah also saw
the beginning, is euident, Ezr. 2. 2. where Nehemiah is named among those, which retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
out of captiuitie, according to the edict of Cyrus.</p>
                        <p>Two answers are here made. 1. that it might be an other Nehemiah beside him, who
was sent to repaire Ierusalem in the 20. yeare of king <hi>Artaxerxes.</hi> 2. the historie may be
transposed: for Nehemiah went not vp then, but 64. yeares after, <hi>Genevens. annotat. Ezra,</hi>
2. 2. 3. And it is further answered, that the Samballat mentioned by Nehemiah, c. 12.
might be an other of that name: or <hi>Iosephus</hi> might mistake the time wherein Samballat li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued:
and whereas Nehemiah speaketh of Iaddua, he onely sheweth that at that time, when
he writ that booke, Iaddua was borne heire to the Priesthood: to this purpose <hi>M. Lydyat</hi> in
his booke <hi>de emendat. tempor. ann.</hi> 3485. set forth this yeare, 609.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. To imagine two Nehemiahs (as they likewise say that Mordecai there named
was an other beside Mordecai in the dayes of Esther) vnlesse some Scripture might be shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for it, is all one, as if they should make two of <hi>Moses, Dauids, Salomons,</hi> or <hi>Zoroba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels</hi>
name. 2. whereas the words stand thus, <hi>these are they, &amp;c. which came with Zerubba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:18834:154"/>
Ieshuaeh, Nehemiah,</hi> Ezr. 2. 2. what a disorder were this in the storie, these beeing named
together, to put off Nehemiahs comming so many yeares after. And beside, this doubt is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued,
Nehem. 7. 5. where Nehemiah saith, <hi>I found a booke of the genealogie of them which
came vp at the first, and found it written there, &amp;c. they which came vp with Zerubbabel, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shuah,
Nehemiah:</hi> all these were captaines and chiefe men, with whome the people returned
at the first: Nehemiah then was one of the captaines, that went vp first out of the captiuitie.
3. To the other answers it may be also thus replied: that Samballat mentioned by Nehemiah,
is the same that assisted Alexander: for he is said to haue had one of Ioiada his sonnes (which
was Manasses the brother of Iaddua) to his sonne in law, Nehem. 13. 28. And <hi>Iosephus</hi> is not
deceiued in casting Samballat into this time, for Nehemiah doth the same: neither was Iad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dua
at this time onely borne, for he is counted among the high Priests: and if Manasses his
younger brother at this time were married, then Iaddua could not be so young, as onely to
be then borne.</p>
                        <p>Thus then Nehemiah beeing found to haue liued from the beginning of the Persian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie
to the ende, may be supposed to haue beene about an 150. yeares of age, or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more: he may be thought to haue beene 20. or 25. at the returne out of captiuitie, and
liued after an 130. the whole time of the Persian Monarchie, which Nehemiahs age will not
suffer to be extended much further.</p>
                        <p>And it neede not seeme straunge, that Nehemiah might be an 150. yeare old: for many
yeares after this, in the time of <hi>Claudius Cesar,</hi> one <hi>T. Fullonius</hi> of Bononia, was found to be
an 150. yeare old: and many other are recorded by <hi>Plinie</hi> in his 7. booke, c. 48, 49, 50. which
in diuers countries liued betweene an 100. and 150. yeares.</p>
                        <p>5. This also is an other manifest proofe, that the Persian Monarchie could not exceede
much an 130. yeares, because in the 6. yeare of Darius, when the house of God was finished,
there were some then aliue which had seene the former house: as the Prophet Hagge saith,
<hi>Who is he among you, that saw this house in her first glorie, and how doe you see it now? is it not
in your eyes, in comparison of it, as nothing?</hi> If now there were an 106. yeares runne since <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
first, as <hi>Iunius</hi> in his annotations vpon that place in the last edition obserueth, they must
haue beene aboue an 180. yeares old,<note place="margin">lib. 6. de e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                              </gap>end.</note> which then liuing had seene the first Temple. <hi>Iosephus
Scalliger</hi> taketh these words spoken by way of wishing in this sense; <hi>O that any were aliue
which had seene the former Temple, he would take this as nothing to that:</hi> But the Prophet
speaketh vnto them in the second person, <hi>is it not in your eyes?</hi> that is, yours which did know
the other Temple: and so <hi>Lyranus</hi> well expoundeth. Therefore from <hi>Cyrus</hi> vnto this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
of <hi>Darius,</hi> might be some 40. yeares and odde: and so some at the age of an 130. or
thereabout, might haue knowne the first Temple standing: and after this there might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
some 80. yeares of the Persian Monarchie.</p>
                        <p>6. And this further may be an other euident argument, that the Persian Monarchie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
not aboue an 130. yeares or thereabout: because Nehem. 12. 26. there are nine seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
men expressed by name, which liued in the daies of Ioiakim sonne of Ieshuah, who was
high Priest in the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

Ioiakim succeeded his father Ieshuah in the Priesthood, in the 45. yeare after their returne,
as <hi>Bullinger</hi> noteth in his tables: 2. <hi>tabul.</hi> 2. These were the chiefe of the Leuites all this while:
they could not be vnder 25. yeares olde in Ioiakims time, for before the Leuites ministred
not: now if the Persian Monarchie continued 200. yeares, or aboue, they must be supposed
to be very neare 200. yeares old.</p>
                        <p>Thus it hath beene sufficiently prooued I trust, that it is most agreeable to Scripture, to

                        <p>But against this computation of the 70. weekes from the first of Cyrus, it will be obiected
thus. 1. that edict, because it was void and tooke no place (for the worke was hindred all
the daies of Cyrus Ezr: 4. 3. notwithstanding his former edict) is not to be accounted for
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:18834:155"/>

they by vertue of that decree laid the foundation of the Temple in the 2. yeare, Ezr. 2. 10.
though the worke were interrupted, from thence the reckoning must beginne: and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for that this decree of Cyrus was the ground of Darius edict renewed afterward, Ezr.
6. yea the Angel foresheweth here as much, in diuiding 7. weekes from the rest, that the
building of the citie and Temple should be interrupted 49. yeares, and should be finished in
a troublesome time, v. 25.</p>
                        <p>2. Though Cyrus edict specially intended the building of the Lords house, yet they had
libertie giuen them there withall to reedifie the walls and citie, as is euident, Ezr. 4. 12. for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
the prophesie of Isai concerning Cyrus, had not beene fulfilled, c. 54. 28. <hi>He saith to
Cyrus, thou art my shepheard, and he shall performe all my desire, saying also to Ierusalem, thou

                        <p>3. That the Persian Monarchie continued not 230. yeares, is prooued before: so that this
obiection is soone answered. And if <hi>Lyranus</hi> thinketh that from Cyrus to Christs passion

of the Persian Monarchie, three other matters shall here be briefly touched. 1. vnder
which of the Persian kings <hi>Mordecai</hi> liued. 2. what king it was by whome the Edict was
renewed to build the Temple. 3. which <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> it was, by whome in the 20. of his

                        <p>1. Some take the great king <hi>Assuerus,</hi> who married Esther, to be <hi>Cambyses</hi> the sonne

                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>felleth him by this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that, seeing <hi>Ezra</hi> liued in the daies of this <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> it is like he would haue made
some honourable mention of Esther and Mordecai. Herein though <hi>Eusebius</hi> doe truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
<hi>Iosephus,</hi> yet his reason is not so forcible: for seeing there is a speciall historie written
of Esther and Mordecai their acts, which booke is like to haue beene made by Ezra, or some
other of the Prophets then liuing, it was not needefull in the other bookes of Ezra and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah,
to make mention of them; seeing in those bookes they meddle not with the Persian
affaires, but with such things as happened about the building of the citie and Temple at Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.
But this reason rather may be vrged, that <hi>Artaxerxes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                                 <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

called also <hi>Artashasht,</hi> who gaue licence to build the Temple, which was finished in
his 6. yeare, and in his 7. sent Ezra, and in his 20. Nehemiah, with new commissions to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire
the citie: it is not like, that he would be so mooued and incensed against the Iewes, to
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:18834:155"/>
roote them out, as <hi>Assuerus</hi> was.</p>
                        <p>4. A fourth opinion there is, that this <hi>Assuerus</hi> was Artaxerxes Mnemon, which succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>Darius Nothus,</hi> the 7. king of Persia: which is the opinion of <hi>Exsebius, Isidore, Beda, Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitius,</hi>
to whome subscribeth <hi>Pererius:</hi> But these two obiections may be made against this
opinion. 1. that if <hi>Esther</hi> had beene the Queene in Nehemiahs time, it is like he would
haue vsed her mediation to the king, or Mordecaies, and not haue pressed himselfe vpon the
king. 2. whereas <hi>Mordecai</hi> is said to haue beene one of those which was carried away in
the captiuitie of Iechoniah, Esth. 2. 6. from which captiuitie vnto the raigne of <hi>Artaxerxes
Muemon</hi> are accounted by the most Chronologers 250. yeares, as <hi>Pererius</hi> confesseth, then
could it not be that <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> vnder whome Esther and Mordecai liued. Hereunto <hi>Pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
answereth, that whereas the words stand thus, <hi>Mordecai, which was the sonne of Iair, the
sonne of Shemei the sonne of Kish, a man of Iemini, which had beene carried away, &amp;c. with the
captiuitie of Iechoniah. &amp;c.</hi> he would haue the relatiue (which) referred to the nearest antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<hi>Iemini,</hi> whome he supposeth to haue beene then carried into captiuitie: But herein
<hi>Pererius</hi> is greatly ouerseene, for <hi>Iemini</hi> is here taken for the tribe Beniamin: as Kish the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Saul is said to be of <hi>Iemini,</hi> 1. Sam. 9. 1. and <hi>Shemei</hi> is called the sonne of <hi>Iemini,</hi> 2.
Sam. 16. 11. Then this <hi>Iemini</hi> could not possibly goe into captiuitie with <hi>Iechoniah.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
other answer better, that it is referred to <hi>Kish,</hi> that he went into captiuitie: so <hi>Burgens.</hi>
and <hi>Iunius</hi> in his last edition: <hi>Ioseph. Scal. l. 6. de emendat. tempor.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But hereunto <hi>Thoring</hi> maketh a double answer. 1. They must shew vs an other <hi>Kish</hi> out
of Scripture, beside the father of Saul, which if they can not doe, <hi>eadem facilitate contemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,
qua probatur,</hi> it may as easily be reiected, as it is prooued: yet this may be admitted, that
this was an other <hi>Kish</hi> beside that auncient <hi>Kish</hi> the father of Saul, as this <hi>Shemei</hi> was diuers
from him that railed vpon Dauid. 2. He hath then a better answer; that if they will count
so many generations, namely these foure, of <hi>Mordecai, Iair, Shemei, Kish,</hi> from the captiuitie
of <hi>Iechonia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>,</hi> they will make Mordecai, either scarse yet borne, or a very young man, who
was now auncient, and nourished Esther as his daughter, he was as a father vnto her: for in
true account there were not aboue an 150. yeares runne since the captiuitie of Iechoniah to
the raigne of this Artaxerxes: and if foure generations of men were then worne out, Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai
must be held a very young man, or not so graue a personage, as the storie maketh him.</p>
                        <p>5. An other opinion is, that Mordecai liued vnder <hi>Xerxes</hi> the fourth king of Persia, who
is also called <hi>Assuerus,</hi> which is the opinion of <hi>Iosephus Scalliger, lib. 6. de emendat, tempor.</hi>
likewise <hi>Thom. Lydiat. lib. de emendat. tempor. in ann.</hi> 3514. and of <hi>Iunius</hi> edition 3. the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
thereof are these. 1. The name <hi>Achashverosh,</hi> which <hi>Scalliger</hi> pronounceth <hi>Oxyares,</hi>
commeth neere the name <hi>Xerxes,</hi> which is after the Greeke pronuntiation, the other is the
Hebrew name. 2. the name of Queene Esther hath great affinitie with <hi>Amestris,</hi> as Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus,
or <hi>Amystris,</hi> as Ctesias, the wife of <hi>Xerxes. 3. Assuerus</hi> is set forth by the largenes
of his kingdome, and the greatnes of his riches, Esth. 1. and <hi>Xerxes</hi> was the rich king of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,
the fourth from Cyrus <hi>inclusiuely,</hi> that is, including Cyrus, Dan. 11. 2. 4. <hi>Assuerus</hi> was
the next king before the first <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> whome <hi>Darius Nothus</hi> succeeded, Ezr. c. 4. v. 7.
and 24. But <hi>Xerxes</hi> was the next predecessour to <hi>Artashasht,</hi> or <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> who was called
<hi>Longimanus,</hi> who was <hi>Xerxes</hi> sonne.</p>
                        <p>But against this last assertion, that this <hi>Assuerus</hi> was <hi>Xerxes,</hi> it will be thus obiected. 1.
that Xerxes is held of the most, not to haue raigned aboue 20. or 22. yeares at the most, and
he was married to Esther but in the 7. yeare, and in the 8. might Darius his sonne be borne,
who was not aboue 13. yeares olde when his father died: yet in the second yeare of his
raigne he had children, Ezr. 6. 10. where the Iewes are bid to pray for the kings life and his
sonnes.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Burgensis</hi> here answereth, that it is spoken by way of supposition, <hi>si filios habuisset,</hi> if he
had had sonnes: But <hi>Thoring</hi> in his replie to <hi>Burgensis</hi> additions, doth here finde fault with
him: for it was neuer heard of, that prayer should be made, <hi>pro non existentibus in rerum
natura,</hi> for them which had yet no beeing or existence in nature.</p>
                        <p>But they which hold <hi>Xerxes</hi> to be this <hi>Assuerus,</hi> will answer, that <hi>Darius</hi> mentioned,
Ezr. 6. 10. was <hi>Darious Nothus,</hi> not this <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus:</hi> now this is after proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to be otherwise, because to the building of the Temple from the going forth of the
word, are but 7. weekes, that is, 49. yeares: but there were in their owne reckoning an 100.
yeares from <hi>Cyrus</hi> to <hi>Darius Nothus:</hi> see hereof further, qu. 58. following.</p>

6. <hi>Bullinger</hi> thinketh this Assuerus to be <hi>Cyaxares</hi> the father of <hi>Darius</hi> the Mede,
who with <hi>Cyrus</hi> surprised Babylon, Dan. 9. 1. But this cannot be: 1. in Esthers time the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie
of the Persians and Medes was ioyned together, Esth. 1. 3. 2. Assuerus chiefe seare
was at <hi>Susis. ibid.</hi> but Ecbatane was the chiefe citie of Media. 3. while the Monarchie
of Babel stood, the Iewes were held in captiuitie vnder the Babylonians, not vnder the
Medes.</p>
                        <p>7. Wherefore it is most probable that this <hi>Assuerus</hi> was <hi>Darius Hystaspis,</hi> which is the
second opinion before rehearsed, for it is shewed before that he was neither <hi>Cambyses,</hi>
nor <hi>Longimanus, Mnemon,</hi> or <hi>Xerxes:</hi> who is he then more like to be then this <hi>Darius?</hi> the
arguments brought for Xerxes may be answered by applying them to <hi>Darius.</hi> 1. the name
<hi>Assuerus</hi> might be a common name to them both: and it seemeth that by <hi>Assuerus</hi> is meant
<hi>Darius</hi> the next to <hi>Cambyses,</hi> who is that <hi>Artashasht</hi> named Ezr. 4. 6. 2. <hi>Darius</hi> was also
of great riches and power. 3. his Queenes name <hi>Atossa</hi> commeth nearer <hi>Hadassa</hi> the other

                        <p>1. The most receiued opinion is, that it was <hi>Darius</hi> the sonne of <hi>Hystaspis</hi> the third king
of Persia, who renewed the edict for the building of the Temple, in whose sixt yeare it was
finished, Ezr. 6. 15. of this opinion is <hi>Iosephus,</hi> with whome <hi>Pererius</hi> consenteth: so also M.
<hi>Calvin,</hi> and M. <hi>Lydyat de emendat. tempor. ann.</hi> 3485. their speciall reason is taken from that
place, Ioh. 2. where the Iewes affirme that the Temple was 46. yeares building: which
time <hi>Pererius</hi> reckoneth thus, <hi>Cyrus</hi> raigned 30. yeares, <hi>Cambyses.</hi> 8. and in the sixt yeare of
<hi>Darius</hi> the Sanctuarie was finished, but 3. yeares after in the ninth, the outward Court, and
all was made an end of, <hi>as Iosephus</hi> writeth, <hi>lib. 11. antiq.</hi> so from the 2. of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> when they
beganne to lay the foundation, vnto the sixt of <hi>Darius,</hi> are 46. yeares.</p>

                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. But seeing Ezra saith, that the house was finished in the sixt yeare, <hi>Iosephus</hi>
conceit is not to be admitted, who in this matter is contrarie to himselfe, <hi>lib. 1. cont. Appion.</hi>
where he saith, that the Temple was reedified in the second yeare of his raigne: Then must
<hi>Pererius</hi> hold him to the sixt yeare: as <hi>Theodoret</hi> also and <hi>Iansenius</hi> doe there ende the 46.
yeares, which the Iewes speake of: whome <hi>Pererius</hi> for that misliketh: but vnto this 6. yeare
by his owne computation are but 43. yeares.</p>
                        <p>2. M. <hi>Calvin</hi> will haue these 46. yeares, and the 7. weekes, which here are seuered from
the rest, v. 25. to agree together, and to make the number euen 49. yeares, he alloweth three

those three other yeares be found out ouer and aboue, to make vp the 49. yeare? Touching
the agreement betweene Daniels 7. weekes and these 46. yeares, more shall be saide, qu. 59.
following. But M. <hi>Lydyat</hi> though he agree with them, that the Temple was reedified in
the 2. of <hi>Darius Hystaspis,</hi> yet he dissenteth in the casting of the time: for he counteth but
12. yeares from Cyrus to the 2. of Darius, all which time, the worke of the Temple was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitted:
but this hath no agreement at all with Daniels 70. weekes seuered from the rest,
because of the intermission of the worke of the Temple.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Iunius</hi> in his first edition, <hi>annot. in Ezr.</hi> 4. 24. was of opinion, that this <hi>Darius</hi> that

And this is most like: for if the building of the Temple be driuen further off then

3. <hi>Iunius</hi> in his last edition thinketh otherwise, that it was <hi>Darius Nothus</hi> in whose sixt

                        <p>1. The Angel saith, <hi>Seuentie weekes are determined ouer the people, and ouer the holy ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:</hi>
that is, within which time there shall be a destruction of both. <hi>Iun. an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </p>
                        <p>2. Our blessed Sauiour doth apply this prophesie of Daniel vnto the desolation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of Ierusalem, Matth. 24. 15. <hi>Polan.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. Daniel first maketh mention of the destruction of the citie and Sanctuarie, and then
speaketh of the confirming of the couenant in one weeke, and of the ceasing of the sacrifices
in the middes of the weeke: which if it be vnderstood of Christs death, it were a preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
order, that after the destruction of the citie, which happened 40. yeares after, he should
returne to speake of the Messiahs death. <hi>M. Lively Persian Monarch.</hi> p. 225.</p>
                        <p>4. To what purpose should mention be made here of the destruction of Ierusalem, if it
be not within the compasse of these weekes.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The Angel expoundeth himselfe afterward, how these words are to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
<hi>vpon thy people,</hi> that is, <hi>to finish their sinnes, and to seale vp their iniquities,</hi> by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing
of the Messiah: this was the speciall intendment and scope of these weekes, yet so,
as if they reiected this gratious offer, then destruction should come vpon them: see more of
the meaning of these words, qu. 19. before.</p>
                        <p>2. Our blessed Sauiour speaketh not there of Daniels propheticall weekes, but onely of
the <hi>abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the Prophet:</hi> it followeth not, because it is
here spoken of, that therefore necessarily it should be comprehended within the compasse
of the 70. weekes.</p>
                        <p>3. There is no disorder at all in the prophesie: for Daniel hauing propounded briefly and
ioyntly together, the slaying of the Messiah, and destruction of the citie, afterward commeth
to handle them seuerally in the next verse, and more fully: so did the Prophet before, v. 25.
for hauing spoken of the 7. weekes and 62. weekes ioyntly, he afterward returneth to the
7. weekes, after the which the streete and wall should be built, and then to the 62. weekes.</p>

<hi>Traian,</hi> for so long the Apostolical preaching continued, <hi>Iohn</hi> the Euangelist suruiuing till
then: But here <hi>Eusebius</hi> committeth two great errours: first, in diuiding the 70. weeke so
farre by the space of 60. yeares from the 69. weekes: secondly, in giuing 70. yeares to the
last weeke, whereas he accounted euery of the formet weekes but at 7. yeares a peece.</p>
                        <p>2. Some Hebrewes (as <hi>Hierome</hi> in his commentarie vpon this place rehearseth their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion)
beginning the 70. weekes from <hi>Darius</hi> the Mede, doe end 62. of them in the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

Iewes, and of their citie vnder the Emperour <hi>Adrian.</hi> Here they manifestly commit two er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours:
1. they count the 7. weekes last, after the 62. weekes, which must be counted first: 2.
the yeares from <hi>Darius</hi> to the Emperour <hi>Adrian,</hi> make aboue 600.</p>
                        <p>3. Some set the ende of these weekes further off, toward the ende of the world at the

comming of Antichrist, who after three yeares and an halfe should be destroyed, and then
the euerlasting kingdome of Christ should be set vp: So <hi>Hyppolitus,</hi> and <hi>Apollinaris:</hi> who
notwithstanding make two beginnings of the weekes; <hi>Hyppolitus</hi> 50. yeares before <hi>Cyrus,</hi>
and <hi>Apollinaris</hi> at the natiuitie of Christ. But these doe manifestly faile in their account: for
1. the weekes must neither beginne so sonne, nor so late, as hath beene before shewed. 2.
<hi>Hyppolitus</hi> continuing 69. weekes to the birth of Christ, referreth the 70. weeke to the
ende of the world, whereas it must followe the other weekes immediately. 3. from Christs
birth there are alreadie past aboue a 1600. yeares: therefore <hi>Apollinaris</hi> account of the 70.

                        <head>Quest. 49. That the 70. weekes must ende at the
passion of Christ.</head>
                        <p>Here there are two opinions. 1. Some will haue the 70. weekes ende 3. yeares and an
halfe after the passion of Christ, which time is allowed for the preaching of the gospel; and
so they beginne the last weeke at the baptisme of Christ. 2. Others thinke that the 70.
weekes must precisely ende at the passion and death of the Messiah.</p>
                        <p>1. Of the first opinion are <hi>Theodoret,</hi> and <hi>Zonaras 1. tem. Annal.</hi> which beginne at
the 20. yearo of <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus,</hi> and end the 62. weekes at the death of <hi>Hyrcanus,</hi>
from whence to Christs baptisme, they count 7. weekes more: and then in the middes of
the last weeke, the Messiah was slaine: so there remained afterward 3. yeares and an halfe
for the preaching of the Gospel: <hi>Eusebius</hi> beginneth the 69. weekes in the 6. yeare of
<hi>Darius Hystaspis,</hi> and endeth 69. of them in the first of Herod, about the death of <hi>Hyrca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
the 70. weeke he beginneth at the baptisme of Christ, and endeth 3. yeares and an
halfe after: <hi>Ioannes Lucidus lib. 7. de emendat. tempor.</hi> beginneth at the 20. yeare of <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xerxes,</hi>
and endeth fowre yeares after Christs passion, so also before him <hi>Lyranus: Pererius</hi>
concurreth with them, who maketh the 69. weekes to ende at the baptisme of Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
at the 20. of <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus,</hi> and the seuenth weeke then to beginne,
which was finished 3. yeares and an halfe after Christs passion: so also M. Lydyat in his booke
<hi>de emendat. tempor. pag.</hi> 75. and 173. But <hi>Osiander</hi> goeth beyond all these, and will haue
the 70. weeke beginne after Christs passion. <hi>Pererius</hi> reason is this, because 69. weekes
must be counted vnto Messiah, which ende in Christs baptisme, when he was declared to
be the sonne of God from heauen, whereas he liued before a priuate life, therefore from
thence the last weeke must beginne. And the better to vphold his opinion of his so begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and ending these 70. weekes, he vse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>h these three helpes. 1. he counteth these 70.
weekes after the yeares of the Moone, which consist of 12. moneths and no more, whereof
490. make but 475: yeares of the Sunne, wherein 13. moneths goe to the yeare. 2. these
70. weekes are so called, though there want halfe a weeke to the passion of Christ, to make
vp a round number, the odde yeares are omitted, as the like is to be seene in other places of
Scripture, as Gen. 15. the Lord telleth Ahraham his seed should soiorne 400. yeares, which
were indeede 405. from Isaaks birth till their comming out of Egypt. <hi>Iunius</hi> also in his first
edition vpon this place, thinketh the odde yeares to be omitted, to make the 70. weekes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
in proportion to the 70. yeares of captiuitie. 3. his third euasion is, that whereas
from the 20. of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> are found to be 477. sunne yeares, which exceede the 490.
moone years more by then two; he saith there are two kinds of numbring, inclusiuely, when
as the numbers, where the account beginneth and endeth are included, and exclusiuely, when
as they are excluded: as Matthew saying that after sixe dayes Christ was transfigured, c. 17.
and Luke after eight dayes, c. 9. the first numbreth exclusiuely, not reckoning the dayes
where the account beginneth and endeth, the other includeth both.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> First, the Angel expoundeth himselfe how the 69. weeke must be vnderstood:
vntill the Messiah should be slaine in the last week: they determine then not at his Baptisme,
but at the weeke wherein he should be slaine.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, concerning his cautels. 1. the Scripture vseth not to count according to the
moone yeares, but according to the course of the Sunne: otherwise by this reason the 70.
yeares of the captiuitie must likewise be cutt short: see before, quest. 17. 2. in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
sometime odde yeaes are omitted, but so it is not here, because these seuentie weekes
are said to be cut our, that is, precisely they shall fall out to be so many weekes of yeares.</p>
                        <p>3. That distinction hath no place here: for seeing the account is made by weekes, if any
part thereof should be reckoned <hi>inclusiuely,</hi> or <hi>exclusiuely,</hi> it must be done by weekes of
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:18834:158"/>
yeares, not by single yeares, as <hi>M. Liuely</hi> well obserueth, pag. 187.</p>
                        <p>2. It remaineth then that these yeares must take their ende precisely at the time of the
death and passion of Christ: as <hi>Iulius, Africanus, Beda, Ruperius, Bullinger, H. Br.</hi> doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
them: and then whereas it is said, <hi>in the middes or halfe weeke the sacrifice shall cease,</hi>
the sense is, that Christ by the sacrifice of himselfe in the latter halfe of the weeke, shall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolish
all other sacrifices in right: and whereas it is said, he shall confirme the couenant in
one weeke, the meaning is, not that all the last weeke this couenant should be in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming:
but the couenant shall be confirmed first by the preaching, and then by the death of
Christ, in the last weeke, which was done in the last middle or halfe part thereof, <hi>Bulling.</hi>
Now for this precise determining of these weekes in the verie passion of the Messiah, the
reasons are these.</p>
                        <p>1. The last weeke endeth at the confirmation of the couenant or Testament, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
saith, <hi>he shall confirme the couenant with many in one weeke:</hi> the weeke then must end
with that confirmation, for not the beginning, but the ende is counted for the weeke. But
the Testament was ratified by the death of Christ, Hebr. 9. 17. <hi>the Testament is confirmed
when men be dead,</hi> therefore this last weeke endeth in Christs death, <hi>Bulling.</hi> 2. The death
of Christ was to fall out in a yeare of Iubile, that the bodie may answer vnto the figure,
therefore it is called the acceptable yeare of the Lord, Isay. 6102. the great yeare of remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of sinnes, and of the redemption of prisoners and captiues: And so the yeare wherein
Christ died, was a Iubile yeare; beeing the 28. Iubile by iust computation from the 8. yeare
of Iosuah, when the first Iubile was kept, for so many Iubilies fall but in 1400. yeares. It is
most probable then, that Daniels 70. weekes should ende with the last Iubile, <hi>H. Br. in 9.
Daniel. 3. M. Liuely</hi> though he ende not the 70. weekes in the passion of the Messiah, yet
he holdeth so many weekes preeisely, gathering so much by the Hobrewe phrase, <hi>Sexentie
weekes is cut out,</hi> where a verbe of the singular number beeing put to a word of the plurall,
sheweth, that euerie one of the weekes particularly from the first to the last, shall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely
and absolutely complete, <hi>Persian Mon. pag.</hi> 159. 4. If any of these weekes should
be extended beyond Christs death, it is more like they should reach to the destruction and
desolation of the di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ie, which is by name expressed: for there is no other cause to extend
them further: the preaching of the Gospell continued longer then three yeare and a halfe
after Christ: therefore in that regard, the halfe weeke is not to be extended beyond Christs
death. 5. <hi>Burgens.</hi> alleadgeth this reason,<note place="margin">Burgens. addit. 3. in 9. cap. Daniel.</note> to shewe that the last ende of these weekes must
concurre with the passion of Christ, <hi>nam deletie iniquitatis, consummatio praevaricationis,
&amp;c.</hi> the taking away of iniquitie, and the finishing of transgression, which are propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the Angel, in his first speach, are the proper effects of Christs passion, &amp;c. vpon this
reason <hi>Burgens.</hi> is so confident, that he concludeth, <hi>the ende</hi> then of these weekes, <hi>est nobis
notus de fide,</hi> is knowne vnto vs, as of faith (that is) certainely. Thus then the argument may
be framed: the finishing of iniquitie and taking away of sinne, were accomplished in the
passion of Christ: but seuentie weekes are determined for the finishing of iniquitie: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
70. weekes are determined at the passion of Christ. 6. <hi>Mel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that the 70. weekes must not extend beyond Christs passion, because the Iewes reiecting
of him, were no longer his people, neither tooke he protection of them.</p>
                        <p>Thus hauing the beginning of these 70. weekes at Cyrus, and the ende at the passion of
Christ, it remaineth then to be shewed, how by a iust computation these 70. weekes may be
brought from Cyrus vnto Christ.</p>

this account. 1. he maketh but 5. kings of Persia. 2. he giueth but an 106. yeares to the
whole Monarchie of the Persians. 31 he fayleth in the particular account of the yeares of
the kings of Persia: he alloweth vnto Darius the Mede 19. yeares, whereas he raigned but
one, and to the last Darius 22. yeares, who raigned but sixe in all: and to <hi>Alexander</hi> be
giueth 12. yeares after, who liued but sixe yeares after Darius ouerthowe. 4. he counteth
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:18834:158"/>
but 53. yeares from Christs natiuitie to the destruction of Ierusalem, which in true account
were 70. yeares at the least: for Christ was borne in the 4. yeare of the 194. Olympiad, and
the citie was taken by <hi>Titus,</hi> in the 4. yeare of the 212. Olympiad.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Lyranus</hi> beginning his account the 5. yeare of <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> when as Ieremiah promised
deliuerance after 70. yeares, reckoneth from that yeare to the destruction of Ierusalem, 6.
yeares, from thence the Hebrewes to the first of Cyrus count 52. yeares: then to Cyrus and
Cambyses he giueth 9. yeares, to <hi>Assuerus</hi> and <hi>Darius,</hi> in whole 6. yeare the Temple was
built, 45. yeares betweene them: all these yeares make beeing put together, 112. yeares,
then the second Temple is held by the Hebrewes to haue stood vnto the second destruction
by Titus, 420. yeares: all make 532. from whence 42. yeares beeing diducted, which
come betweene the blessed passion of our Lord, and the destruction of Ierusalem, there
will remaine iust 490. yeares. <hi>Paulus Burgens.</hi> agreeing with <hi>Raimundus</hi> beginning and
ending as <hi>Lyranus</hi> doth, yet proceedeth an other way from the 4. of Zedekiah, which
was in the 12. yeare of Nebuchadnezzar, who raigned in all 45. yeares, there remained of
his raigne 34. yeares, and of <hi>Evilmerodachs</hi> 32. and 3. yeares of <hi>Balthazars</hi> raigne: all
these make 60. yeares: then <hi>Darius</hi> raigned two, <hi>Cyrus 30. Assuerus 14. Darius</hi> his sonne
had raigned 6. when the Temple was finished: these yeares make 52. and the second Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
stood 420. yeares: as is the generall opinion of the Hebrewes: these yeares ioyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
make 532. from whence must be diducted 42. yeares, from the passion of Christ to
the destruction of the citie.</p>
                        <p>But beside the disagreement in these two accounts, betweene the number of yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Cyrus, and the number of the yeares of the kings of Persia, which breedeth a great
vncertaintie, these manifest errors are committed. 1. whereas the captiuitie ending in Cyrus
first, had continued 70. years, this terme cannot stand with either of the former accounts: for
if the beginning of the captiuitie be set in the 8. yeare of Nebuchadnezzars raigue, when
Iechoniah went into captiuitie, where it ought to beginne, there will want by <hi>Lyranus</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
who reckoneth but 58. yeares from the 5. of Zedekiah, which was 4. yeares after
Iechoniahs captiuitie, 8. yeares; by <hi>Burgensis,</hi> who counteth from thence 60. yeares, there
will want sixe of 70. yeares. 2. They both betweene <hi>Cambyses</hi> and <hi>Darius</hi> set one <hi>Assuerus,</hi>
whereas the first <hi>Darius</hi> the sonne of <hi>Hystaspis,</hi> immediately succeeded <hi>Cambyses.</hi> 3.
whereas they make Darius the first, sonne of <hi>Assuerus,</hi> the truth is, that <hi>Darius</hi> the first was
that <hi>Assuerus</hi> himselfe, as is before shewed, quest. 44. 4. whereas they make Darius, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
whom the Temple was finished but the fourth king of Persia, as <hi>Cyrus, Cambyses, Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erus,</hi>
and then <hi>Darius,</hi> it is euident that the 4. king of Persia, was the rich king of Persia,
which was <hi>Xerxes,</hi> Dan. 11. 3.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Pintus,</hi> who beginneth the 70. weekes right, at Cyrus first, and endeth them well in
the passion of our Sauiour, doth make the 70. weekes, and the tearme of yeares to agree by
two seuerall accounts. One way he casteth vp his reckoning thus: the Perfians raigned 191.
yeares, the Greekes to the beginning of <hi>Iulius Caesars</hi> Empire 220. yeares, from thence to
the passion of Christ, are 76. yeares and 3. yeares and an halfe after Christs death doe the
70. weekes ende: all these yeares make iust 490. and an halfe, which is omitted: But these
exceptions may be taken to this reckoning: 1. that the Persian Monarchie could not possibly
continue an 191. yeares, as is prooued before, quest. 43. 2. the Greeke Empire continued
300. yeares as <hi>Lyranus,</hi> and <hi>H. Br.</hi> and most consent: so also <hi>Iunius</hi> in his annotations, and
<hi>Polanus:</hi> as it shall further appeare in the 54. quest. following.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Pintus</hi> hath beside this an other reckoning: from the going forth of the word, vnto
the finishing of the Temple, which beganne two yeares after the returne of the people (and
it was 46. yeares in building) are 48. yeares, and the Temple stood 480. yeares, from the
second building thereof to the second destruction, the whole summe is 528. from which
summe must be diducted 38. yeares and an halfe from the ende of the 70. weeke, which
was three yeares and an halfe after the passion of Christ, vnto the destruction of the citie,
and there will remaine 490. yeares.</p>
                        <p>But thus this account also may be accepted against. 1. he sheweth not how from Cyrus
first, vnto the finishing of the Temple, there were but 48. yeares, the 7. weekes mentioned,
v. 25. make 49. yeares, which were expired at the finishing of the Temple in the sixt of
Darius, seequeth 58. following. 2. The second Temple might stand so long, though the
Hebrewes generally held that it continued but 420. yeares: but the 70. weekes ending in
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:18834:159"/>
Christs passion, as is shewed before, there must be diducted 40. as some thinke 42. yeares,
which came betweene the passion of Christ, and the destruction of the citie: so that this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of <hi>Pintus</hi> commeth short in the first part one yeare, and in the second two: for he rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koneth
but 48. yeares to the finishing of the Temple, whereas 49. euen 7. propheticall
weekes were expired then, and he alloweth but 38. yeares in the last number, which should
be 40. or 42. yeares.</p>
                        <p>5. But the account of <hi>R. Salomon</hi> is much more short, who reckoneth but 490. yeares
from the destruction of the first temple by Nebuchadnezzar, to the destruction of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
by Titus, whereof to Cyrus first he counteth 52. yeares. Not much differing is the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of other Hebrewes, who from Cyrus first vnto the destruction of Ierusalem make
reckoning but of 430. yeares, allowing to the Persian Monarchie but 50. yeares, to the
raigne of the Greekes, an 175. to the Macchabees 103. to the Herodians an 103. as <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus</hi>
setteth it downe in his <hi>apparat, in Daniel.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But here are manifest errors in this account. 1. they beginne the 70. weekes 52. yeare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
before the Angel deliuered this prophesie. 2. they giue vnto the Persian Monarchie but 50.
yeares, whereas so many yeares saue one were expired at the finishing of the Temple; and
after that Nehemiah maketh mention of 32. yeares of the raigne of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> c. 5. 14.
3. from the ende of the Persian Monarchie to the destruction of Ierusalem, are yeares 400.
which are thus gathered 300. yeares of the kingdome of the Greekes, 60. yeares of the
Romane Empire to the death of Christ, and about 40. thence to the ouerthrow of the citie.</p>
                        <p>6. This then is resolued vpon as the best account: the Persian Monarchie continued from
the first of Cyrus 130. yeares, the Macedonians raigned 300. the Romanes vnto the death
of Christ 60. But for the more euident proofe and demonstration hereof, it shall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse
to set downe the particular account of the yeares of the Persian and Grecian Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie,

                        <p>4. <hi>Iunius</hi> likewise affirmeth, that the Temple beganne to be built 30. yeares before the

180. yeare old: 106. from Cyrus, and 70. yeare befor from the beginning of the captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
in the 8. yeare of Nebuchadnezzars raigne, in whose 19. yeare the Temple was destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
the summe will be 176 yeares: and they could not be of fewer yeares then 10. or 12. to
remember any thing of the first Temple: But this was too great an age for those times.</p>
                        <p>6. Some giuing but an 130. yeares in all to the Persian Monarchie, doe count 30. yeares
from Cyrus first vnto <hi>Xerxes</hi> warre against the Grecians, which was sixe yeares after Darius
death, and from thence <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus</hi> began to raigne 42. yeares, partly alone, &amp;
partly together with his father before: and afterward followed <hi>Darius Nothus,</hi> whom some
call <hi>Darius Ochus, H. Br. proleg. in Dantel:</hi> but by this reckoning, there will not be 49.

                        </p>
                        <p>7. <hi>Beroaldus</hi> finding so great vncertaintie in the yeares of the Persian kings, thinketh
that though the particular yeares cannot be set downe, yet the whole time of the Persian
Monarchie could not exceede an 130. yeares.</p>
                        <p>8. But though I consent therein to Beroaldus, for the exact scanning of the particular
yeares, yet some coniecturall gesse may be made of the yeares of some of the Persian kings
put together: as it is agreed vpon by the most, that Cyrus and Cambyses raigned together
9. yeares, then <hi>Darius Hystaspis</hi> and <hi>Xerxes</hi> might haue the first 14. the other 20. which
with <hi>Darius</hi> sixe, and <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Cambyses</hi> nine make 49. yeares: but how these yeares
should be exactly diuided among these 3. kings, it cannot be certainely set downe, because
the sonne raigned with the father: and as <hi>Xerxes</hi> raigne ranne within his fathers, so <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xerxes</hi>
his sonne raigned also in his fathers time: this shall be further shewed in the question

of the Temple, there will remaine but 57. to the ende of that Monarchie. But herein is
<hi>Teriullian</hi> deceiued, in making but fiue kings of Persia in all.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Iunius</hi> in his third edition, in his annotations vpon this place, summeth the yeares
from the 2. of <hi>Nothus</hi> to the ende of the Persian Monarchie, to 93. for <hi>Nothus</hi> he, counteth
19. yeares in all, and from his second 18. for <hi>Mnemon 43. Ochus 23. Arses 3. Darius</hi> the
last 6. so also <hi>Polanus:</hi> which yeares beeing added to the 106. which he thinketh were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired
from <hi>Cyrus</hi> first, at the 2. of <hi>Nothus,</hi> make 200. saue one. But the age of Nehemiah,
who saw the beginning and ende of that Monarchie, will not permit, that so many yeares be
allowed vnto it.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi>Pintus</hi> giuing vnto the Persian Monarchie 191. yeares, and counting 48. vnto the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
of the Temple, must leaue an 143. yeares or thereabout, for the time of that Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie,
after the finishing of the Temple: But vpon the former reason of Nehemiahs age, this
can not be admitted.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi>Pererius</hi> from the 1. of Cyrus to the 2. of <hi>Nothus,</hi> counteth an 140. yeares, and from
thence to the ende of that Monarchie some 94. yeares: <hi>M. Lively</hi> also agreeth with him in
the same account, <hi>Pers. Monarch. p.</hi> 53. they differ but in 2. yeares: <hi>Pererius</hi> allotteth to the
Persian Monorchie 232. yeares, <hi>lib. 13. in Dan. M. Lively</hi> 230. But it is sufficiently shewed
before, that the Persian Monarchie could not continue so long, qu. 43.</p>
                        <p>7. But <hi>Montanus</hi> counting by the high Priests goeth beyond them in all in his recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
for the latter part of the Persian Monarchie:<note place="margin">in apparat. lib. Daniel.</note> for he giueth vnto <hi>Eliashib</hi> 41. yeares, in
whose 14. yeare he saith Nenemiah returned to the king of Persia after the citie was repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
which was in 32. yeare of <hi>Mnemons</hi> raigne, Nehem. 5. 14. there remaine then of <hi>Elia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shibs</hi>
yeares 27. then <hi>Ioiada</hi> succeeded 25. yeares, <hi>Iohanan</hi> 24. yeares, <hi>Iaddua,</hi> to the time of
Alexander 27. thus there shall be an 103. yeares from the 32. yeare of Mnemon, to the ende
of the Persian Monarchie; vnto the which adde the 32. yeares of Mnemon, and 7. yeares of
Darius, there will arise an 142. yeares from the finishing of the Temple to the ende of the
Persian Monarchie, which Nehemiahs age will by no meanes endure.</p>
                        <p>8. This then is the best resolution, that although in such great varietie and difference,
the particular yeares can not well be assigned vnto the seuerall kings of Persia, which suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
after the finishing of the Temple, yet the whole summe is must not extende beyond
80. or 81. or thereabout: so that thus the whole summe is made vp: 49. yeares are counted
from <hi>Cyrus</hi> 1. to the 6. of <hi>Darius,</hi> when the Temple was finished: and thence to the ende of
the Persian Monarchie, if 81. yeares more be added, we shall haue the whole summe of an
130. yeares: this account followeth <hi>Beroaldus, Iunius</hi> in his annotations, <hi>edit. 1. H. Brough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
in his proleg. in Dan.</hi> who last named doth thus parcell out the yeares: from Cyrus to
Xerxes 6. when he warred against Grecia, he giueth 30. yeares, to Artaxerxes with his father
and alone, 42. to Ochus, called also Darius Nothus, alone 8. with his father 16. to Mnemon
42. to Ochus 3. to Darius the last 5. or 6. the whole summe is an 130.</p>

                        <p>Hauing the certentie of the yeares of the Persian Monarchie in generall, the next part of
the 490. yeares, decyphered in the 70. weekes, consisteth in the due examination of the
yeares of the kingdome of the Grecians: where there are fiue seuerall accounts. 1. by the
raigne of the kings of Syria, 2. by the yeares of the high Priests, 3. by the yeares of the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
and Princes of the Iewes, 4. by the yeares of the kings of Egypt, 5. by the Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piades.</p>
                        <p>1. By the Syrian kings, the account is vncerten: there are numbred of them in all from
<hi>Seleucus Nicanor,</hi> the first king and founder of the familie of the Seleucians, to <hi>Seleucus</hi> the
sonne of <hi>Gryphus</hi> 19. kings: their particular names, with the yeares of their raigne, it is not
needefull here to set downe: we shall haue further occasion to deale with them in particular
in the 11. chapter. But the reason why the account taken by them is not certen; is this: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the kingdome of Syria, beganne 15. yeares after Alexanders death, and after the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Egypt, and it ended aboue 50. yeares before the kingdome of the Herodians began
in Iudea, about which time the raigne of <hi>Cleopaora,</hi> the last Queene and Regent of Egypt,
expired.</p>

this reckoning by the yeares of the high Priests is vncerten, and the rather, because the times

                        <p>Both these summes put together make 292. there wanteth 6. to make vp 300. yeares. And
beside, there is great variance and difference about the summe of these yeares: <hi>Montanus</hi>
setteth downe an other account of the Hebrewes, who allow vnto the kingdome of the
Grecians 175. yeares, before the time of the Macchabees, to whose gouernment they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe
but an 103. yeares, which make in all but 278. here want 22. yeares of 300. <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthon</hi>
much differeth not from the last account: he giueth vnto <hi>Alexander</hi> 7. yeares, to the
<hi>Seleucians</hi> vnto <hi>Iudas Macchabeus</hi> 146. to the <hi>Macchabees</hi> from <hi>Iudas</hi> vnto <hi>Herod</hi> 127.
the whole summe is 280. there yet are wanting 20. yeares. The former of these numbers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth
with the account of yeares in the booke of the Macchabees, where it is said, that
<hi>Antiochus</hi> died in the 149. yeare, 1. Macchab. 6. 16. and three yeare before that Iudas Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabeus
beganne to oppose himselfe against the tyrannie of <hi>Autiochus Epimanes.</hi> Hitherto
then we can haue no certentie for the iust number of these yeares.</p>
                        <p>4. The fourth way is to proceede by the account of the yeares of the <hi>Ptolomes</hi> of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt:
for <hi>Ptolomeus Lagi</hi> beganne his gouernment immediatly after <hi>Alexanders</hi> death:
and <hi>Cleopatra</hi> the daughter of <hi>Ptolome Auletes</hi> raigned in Egypt to the beginning of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rods</hi>
raigne in Iewrie, and somewhat after: their yeares are set downe thus, according to the

This summe commeth short of 300, by 15. and beside here are 12. yeares giuen vnto <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi>

was destroyed in the 822. yeare: then diducting 38. yeares from thence backward to
the passion of Christ, (which <hi>Bullinger</hi> maketh 40. placing the destruction of Ierusalem 2.

v. 25. Vnto the Messiah shall be 7. weekes,
and 62. weekes.</head>
                        <p>1. Some thinke that no other reason is to be giuen hereof, but that the Angel of purpose
thus speaketh, that the prophecie should be vttered in darke and obsture tearmes: as <hi>Hierom</hi>
to this purpose saith vpon the 45. of Ezekiel, <hi>Scriptura difficultatem habet in numeris, vt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentum
faciat animum auditoris,</hi> the Scripture vseth some difficultie in numbers, to make
the minde of the hearer more intent: But it is euident, by the diuiding of the last weeke
from the rest, wherein some speciall matters are deliuered, concerning the death of the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,
and the confirming of the couenant, and ceasing of the sacrifices, that there is some spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
intendment in the setting apart also of the 7. weekes from the rest.</p>
                        <p>2. Some doe thinke, that it is onely an Hebrew phrase, who vse to set the lesse number
before the greater: as we would say, speaking of Abraham, he liued an 175. yeares, but the
Scripture saith, he liued 5. and 70. and an 100. yeares: so <hi>Hierome.</hi> But to this <hi>Calvin</hi> answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
<hi>non continuat seriem annorum, &amp;c.</hi> he continueth not here the course of yeares, as in
setting downe the age of man, &amp;c. for the reason in setting downe of numbers in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
is, because they are of diuers kinds: when the yeares are numbred by hundreds, tennes,
and vnions: but here the number is all of the same kind, 70. in all. And if the Hebrew phrase
should be here obserued, he should haue said, <hi>nine; and sixtie,</hi> or 7. 2. and 60. two should
not be put after 60. And why is the 70. weeke put last of all? it should after that manner of
speaking be put first: as to say thus, 1. and 7. and 62. There is then more here to be con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

then the phrase onely.</p>
                        <p>3. Some make no matter at all of this diuision, but put the 7. weekes and 62. weekes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:
that after 69. weekes the Messiah shall be slaine, <hi>Melancth. Vatab. Osiand.</hi> but then
this diuision made of purpose by the Angel should seeme to be idle.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Pererius</hi> therefore giueth this reason of this diuision, because in these seuen weekes,
which make 49. yeares, there were two notable accidents; the repairing of the citie by Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah,
and in the ende of this tearme fell out that notable historie of <hi>Mordecat</hi> and <hi>Esther</hi>
vnder <hi>Artaxerxes Mnemon.</hi> But <hi>Pererius</hi> is here deceiued: for as it shall afterward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
the repairing of the citie by Nehemiah, was without the compasse of these 7. weekes:
and the other storie fell out in the space of this tearme, but not vnder <hi>Mnemon:</hi> that <hi>Assue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
                           <pb n="323" facs="tcp:18834:162"/>
is most like to be <hi>Darius Hystaspis,</hi> as is before shewed, qu. 44.</p>
                        <p>5. Some giue a mysticall reason of it, as <hi>Burgens. addit. 4. Antiqua lex dicitur septena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,
nova octonaria,</hi> the olde law is signified by seuen, the new law by eight: to shew hereby
that the Messiah should bring in a new law, and abolish the old. But the Messiah was not to
come in those 7. weekes, but after 62. weekes more.</p>
                        <p>6. So then in that the 7. weekes are diuided from the rest, it doth not so much shew
what notable accidents should fall out therein, as it doth prescribe the very number of
yeares, after the which from the going out of the word, the Temple and citie should againe
be repaired and reedified; which accordingly came so to passe, as shall be shewed afterward.</p>

the 62. weekes.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi>Tertullian</hi> putteth them after: for the 62. weekes he extendeth from Darius to the
birth of Christ, and then 7. weekes and an halfe, that is, 53. yeares, he counteth from thence
to the destruction of Ierusalem. But from Christs birth, who suffered in the 34. yeare of his
age, to the destruction of the citie, some 40. yeares after, was aboue seuen weekes, they make
10. weekes, 70. yeares at the least.</p>
                        <p>2. Some Hebrewes, whose opinion <hi>Hierome</hi> rehearseth in his commentarie vpon this
place, doe ende the 62. yeares at the taking of the citie by <hi>Titus,</hi> and from thence to the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
destruction by <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperour, they count 8. weekes more, which maketh 56.
yeares. But beside that there are found from <hi>Darius</hi> to <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperour, aboue 600.
yeares, whereas 72. weekes make but 490. yeares: the 7. weekes must be counted to the
Messiah, as is euident, v. 25. not after.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Theodoret</hi> bringeth the 69. weekes to <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> death, and from thence to the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
of Christ, he counteth 7. weekes, that is 49. yeares: But he is much deceiued in his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count:
for from <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> death to the baptisme of our Sauiour, are about 60. yeares: for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Hyrcanus</hi> in the 32. yeare of <hi>Herod,</hi> or thereabout, was Christ borne, who was baptized
in the 30. yeare of his age.</p>
                        <p>4. Now that these 7. weekes are to be counted before the 62. weekes, not to be cast af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them, 1. the order of the words declare: there shall be seuen weekes to the Messiah,
and 62. weekes. 2. and beside it is said, that not after 69. weekes, but after 62. weekes Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah
shall be slaine: so that vnlesse the 62. weekes be put to the 7. weekes, the yeares will not
bring vs to the Messiah. 3. the accidents that fell out after that time, the building of the
citie, and the wall, which were done after the tearme of these 7. weekes, which things accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
came to passe, will bring backe these 7. weekes into the first place. 4. And beside
the Angel directly beginneth the 7. weekes from the going forth of the word, v. 25.</p>

Cyrus, which time by his account maketh 52. yeares. But in this number of 52. yeares, there
are 3. yeares aboue 7. prophetical weekes, that is, 49. yeares, which the Rabbin is constrained
(to make his account euen) to put off to the beginning of the 62. weekes: but then is not the
Angels diuision iust and true, that cutteth off onely 7. weekes from the rest: and beside, these

                        <p>2. M. <hi>Calvin</hi> beginneth these yeares in the first of Cyrus, and endeth them in the sixt
yeare of Darius the sonne of Hystaspis, the 3. king of Persia: but this can not be: for they that

weekes here be fulfilled? Beside, that <hi>Darius,</hi> in whose sixt the Temple was reedified, called
<hi>Darius</hi> of Persia, was not Darius Hystaspis, the 3. king of Persia, but before this Darius three

3. <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> proceedeth an other way: for thus he casteth vp the reckoning: he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
vnto Cyrus 9. yeares, and to Cambyses 8. or to Cyrus 14. and to Cambyses 3. and
then he putteth hereunto 20. of <hi>Darius,</hi> when Nehemiah was sent to Ierusalem, in whose
32. yeare the building of the citie was finished. But in this account diuers errours are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.
1. in giuing 17. yeares to Cyrus and Cambyses, therein he differeth from other
Chronologers: the Hebrewes giue vnto them both 9. yeares ioyntly: the most 37. yeares:
<hi>Bullinger</hi> to Cyrus 16. to Cambyses 8. If it shall be free for men, to allot vnto the raigne of
kings more or fewer yeares at their pleasure, wheresoeuer they beginne their account, they
may make it agree. 2. <hi>Darius</hi> in whose time the Temple was built, was not <hi>Darius</hi> the
sonne of <hi>Hystaspis,</hi> who immediatly succeeded Cambyses: for before this <hi>Darius</hi> are named
three other kings, as is shewed before out of Ezr. 4. 6, 7. but <hi>Darius Hystaspis</hi> was the third
king of Persia.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Bullinger</hi> will haue these 7. weekes beginne in the 7. yeare of <hi>Artaxerxes Longima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
when Ezra was sent with a new commission to Ierusalem, Ezr. 7. from thence counting
49. yeares we shall come to the 11. yeare of <hi>Darius Nothus;</hi> counting as he doth to <hi>Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus</hi>
raigne 44. yeares: and in this time was the citie repaired by Nehemiah, but with
much trouble. But this account also faileth: 1. The Temple was, after many yeares inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
built and finished before Ezra was sent, in the 6. yeare of Darius, Ezr. 6. 15. which
intermission is signified, in the diuiding of these 7. weekes from the rest, as shall afterward
appeare, qu. 59. 2. He beginneth the 7. weekes, where they should ende, namely at the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
of the Temple, as shall be shewed afterward.</p>
                        <p>5. They likewise which beginne these 7. weekes at the 20. yeare of <hi>Artaxerxes Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus,</hi>
as <hi>Pererius,</hi> with diuers others, can shew no reason, why these 7. weekes should be
cut off from the rest, sauing that because in this time Nehemiah was sent: and in the ende of
this tearme, in the raigne of <hi>Artaxerxes Mnemon,</hi> he thinketh the historie of Esther and
Mordecai fell out. But <hi>Pererius</hi> is much deceiued. 1. he beginneth the 7. weekes after the
time, wherein they should ende, namely, at the finishing of the Temple, as followeth to be
shewed. 2. And it is before prooued, that Mordecai liued not vnder <hi>Artaxerxes Mne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
but vnder <hi>Darius Hystaspis,</hi> who is called <hi>Assuerus,</hi> as is shewed before, qu. 44. 3.
But though they seeme to alleadge some reason for the beginning of these 7. weekes in the
20. of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> there can be no probable cause shewed, of the ending of these weekes,
which by <hi>Pererius</hi> account will bring vs to the 10. yeare of <hi>Artaxerxes Mnemons</hi> raigne,
whome he supposeth to be Esters Assuerus: for in that storie, there is no speciall note made
of the 10. yeare, but of the 3. yeare, wherein he made a feast to his nobles, Esth. 1. 3. of the
7. yeare, when he married Esther, c. 2. 16. and of the 12. yeare, when Haman procured the
decree against the Iewes, c. 3. 7.</p>
                        <p>6. Some beginne these 7. weekes at the 20. yeare of Artaxerxes Longimanus, and ende
them at the 2. of Artaxerxes Memor, <hi>M. Lydyat, pag.</hi> 78.</p>
                        <p>But beside the difference in this computation betweene him and <hi>Pererius,</hi> who bringeth
the 7. weekes from the 20. of <hi>Longimanus,</hi> to the 10. of <hi>Memor,</hi> or <hi>Mnemon,</hi> no reason
can be assigned of the breaking off and diuiding those 7. weekes from the other: he saith,
that other cities of Iudea beganne then to be builded, but with much trouble: but Daniel
maketh mention onely of building Ierusalem in this place.</p>
                        <p>7. <hi>Iosephus Scalliger lib. 6. de emendat. tempor. M. Iunius, M. Liuely</hi> in his Persian
Monarchie, and <hi>Polanus</hi> beginne these 7. weekes in the 2. yeare of <hi>Darius Nothus,</hi> and
ende them in the 32. of Artaxerxes Mnemon, when Nehemiah returned, after he had finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the building of the citie vnto the king of Persia, Nehem. 5. 14. there remained 17.
yeares after Darius second, whom they held to haue raigned 19. yeares: which make the
summe of 49. yeares: in which space of time, both the Temple and citie were builded.</p>
                        <p>But against this opinion it may thus be obiected. 1. the 7. weekes, and the 70. weekes
haue the same beginning from the going forth of the word, which is before prooued at
large to haue beene in the first of Cyrus, quest. 43. 2. they beginne these weekes where
they should ende: for these 7. weekes were the time of the intermission and breaking off of
their worke, in building the citie and Temple: the Angel sheweth how long that worke
should be interrupted, after the which they should beginne to build.</p>
                        <p>8. <hi>M. Iunius</hi> then in his former edition beginneth these weekes in the first of Cyrus, and
endeth them in the 20. yeare of <hi>Longimanus,</hi> when Nehemiah had his commission giuen
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:18834:163"/>
him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so also <hi>H. Br.</hi> in his commentarie: But from Cyrus 1. to the sending of Nehemiah in
the 20. Artaxerxes Longimanus, must needes be aboue 49. yeares in account: for the foure
former kings of Persia, <hi>Cyrus, Cambyses, Darius</hi> the sonne of <hi>Hystaspis,</hi> and Xerxes, had
more then 30. yeares among them.</p>
                        <p>9. Wherefore the best reckoning of these 7. weekes is this: to beginne them with <hi>M.
Calvin, Oecolampad. M. Br.</hi> in Cyrus first, and to ende them in the 6. of <hi>Darius Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus,</hi>
when the Temple was finished: and in the 7. yeare was Ezra sent, and in the 20. by
the same king, Nehemiah: my reasons are these. 1. from the first going forth of the word,
which was in Cyrus time; must these 7. weekes take beginning, which make 49. yeares: the
time is too short to end them in the raigne of Darius Hystaspis, which was within 49. yeares,
and too long to extend them to <hi>Darius Nothus,</hi> who was the sixt king of Persia, which
was about 70. yeares from Cyrus first: therefore one must be taken betweene them, and that
was Darius Artaxerxes called Longimanus, who was next before <hi>Nothus: Longimanus</hi> is
held by the most to haue raigned 40. yeares, which yeares added to the raigne of 4. kings
before <hi>Cyrus, Cambyses, Darius, Xerxes,</hi> will make too many for the account of 49. yeares,
to the 2. of <hi>Nothus.</hi> 2. The Temple was 46. yeare in building as the Iewes say, Iohn. 2.
which yeares must be accounted from the 3. of Cyrus, when the building beganne to be
hindred, for the which cause Daniel was in heauines 3. weekes of dayes, Dan. 10. 3. so we
shall haue the summe of 46. yeares from Cyrus 3. and of 49. from Cyrus 1. to the finishing
of the Temple.</p>
                        <p>But it will be obiected, that it was <hi>Darius Nothus,</hi> in whose 6. the Temple was built, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he had an Artaxerxes going before him, Ezra. 4. 7. and an other after him, Ezr. 6. 14.
and 7. 1. and so he was in the middes betweene two Artaxerxes, <hi>Longimanus</hi> and <hi>Mnemon,</hi>

hinderer of the building of the Lords house. 1. <hi>Longimanus</hi> is held of all to haue beene
a friend vnto the Iewes. 2. In the accusation sent to <hi>Artashasht</hi> they say, that the Iewes
did build and lay the foundation of the walles, Ezr. 4. 12. they speake, as of a thing then in
doing, which could not be so many yeares (more then 40) after in <hi>Longimanus</hi> time: for the
worke was intermitted vnto the time of Darius. Ezra. 4. 5. this complaint then was made
to Artashasht, prince vnder Cyrus, namely, <hi>Cambyses</hi> his sonne, who had the administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

of that accusation, which formerly had beene made.</p>

there are diners opinions. 1. Some thinke, that <hi>Artaxerxes Mnemon</hi> caused such things
to be finished, which belonged to the ornament of the Temple, which was made an ende of
in his fathers time: <hi>ex Vatabl.</hi> but here the finishing of the Temple is ascribed to Darius and
Artashasht together, not to one after an other. 2. <hi>Iunius</hi> thinketh, that Artashasht raigned
together with his father: but it is not like that in the second yeare of Darius, when the worke
beganne, that Darius sonne was so old, as to take the administration of the kingdome vpon
him. 3. Some by <hi>Darius</hi> vnderstand Darius the Mede, who ioyntly with Cyrus gaue

                        <p>4. Some thinke that the first Artashasht or Artaxerxes mentioned Ezra. 4. 7. was <hi>Smer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>
which vsurped the kingdome after <hi>Cambyses,</hi> for 7. moneths: and the other <hi>Artaxerxes</hi>

there could be such entercourse by letters to and fro from the king of Persia to Ierusalem

<hi>Longimanus,</hi> as is before shewed, and the same was the Darius also there mentioned, Ezra.

who yet raigned not, but is mentioned by anticipation, as be thinketh: and as <hi>Darius</hi> is here
called king of Ashur, fo is Artashasht called king of Babel, Nehem. 13. 6. they were both
the same as is before shewed, a part of the kingdome is taken for the whole.</p>

building of the Temple 46. yeare, and to the laying of the foundation 3. yeares, which
make 49. in all: but this account cannot stand neither, for the 7. weekes must beginne from
the going forth of the word, which was in the 1. of Cyrus: the foundation of the Temple
was laid in the 2. yeare, then cannot the 7. weekes and these 49. yeares, wherein the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
was built, ende together, not beginning together.</p>
                        <p>7. Some thinke that the Iewes speake not of the Temple built by <hi>Zorobabel,</hi> but of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rods

                        <p>8. But the more receiued and probable opinion is, that the Iewes speake of the Temple
built after their returne out of captiuitie, and finished, not then in building; and thus the 7.
weekes, and the 46. yeares are made to agree together: the 7. weekes, which make 49.
yeares, beginne at <hi>Cyrus</hi> 1. and the 46. yeares must be counted from the third of Cyrus,

                           <hi>Paulus Burgensis</hi> thus confuteth this assertion, because none are simply in Scripture cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<hi>annointed,</hi> but those which were annointed either with materiall oyle, as the kings and
Priests, or with spirituall, as the Prophets; but Cyrus was neither of these wayes annointed.
And whereas this place is vrged of Cyrus, he saith it is not to be vnderstood of Cyrus, but
of the Messiah: this answer of <hi>Burgens.</hi> is verie weake: for in that the Prophet saith, <hi>Cyrus,
his annointed,</hi> what is more euident, then that he speaketh of Cyrus, beeing expressed by
name? <hi>Pererius</hi> answer also is vnsufficient, that <hi>Cyrus</hi> was long before the beginning of

                        <p>1. Thus therefore is this opinion rather refelled. 1. because he himselfe counteth 52. weekes
vnto Cyrus, which make aboue 7. weekes of yeares, <hi>Burgens.</hi> 2. Afterward by Messiah
that should be slaine, he vnderstandeth <hi>Agrippa</hi> king of the Iewes; and so he changeth the
person, taking the Messiah for two diuerse persons: whereas it is euident, that the Prophet
speaketh of one and the same Messiah, <hi>Lyran.</hi> 3. he is called Messiah the gouernour, or
principall, for so the word <hi>nagid</hi> signifieth: but none is called the principall Messiah but

                        <p>3. Some by Messiah, taking the singular for the plurall, doe vnderstand the annointed
gouernours, whom <hi>Eusebius</hi> taketh to be the Macchabees, who were both Priests and kings:
but vnto the beginning of the raigne of the Maccabees, were aboue 7. weekes from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the 70. weekes, wheresoeuer they beginne them: for the regiment of the Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabees

more largely, for the chiefe rulers and kings of the Iewes commonwealth, vnto the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of whose setled estate are counted 7. weekes: for from the 2. of <hi>Darius Nothus</hi>
when the Temple beganne to be reedified, of whose raigne there remained 17. yeares, to
the 32. of Arrashasht, are iust 49. yeares, in whose 32. yeare the citie beeing builded, and
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:18834:165"/>
set forme of gouernement established, Nehemiah returned vnto the king, Nehem. 13. 6. of
this his opinion he yeeldeth two speciall reasons. 1. from the Hebrewe point <hi>athnah,</hi> after
7. weekes, which beeing a perfect distinction, doth suspend it from the sentence following:
so that he would haue these 7. weekes to the Messiah, taken by themselues, and not to be
ioyned with the 62. weekes following. 2. these two things beganne together, the citie
builded, and the annointed gouernour thereof: as <hi>Samballat</hi> in a letter to Nehemiah ioyneth
them both together, Nehem. 6. 6. <hi>thou and the Iewes thinke to rebell, for the which cause
thou buildest ihe wall, and thou wilt be the king thereof,</hi> to this purpose <hi>M. Liuely, p.</hi> 209.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ. 1. Oecolampadius</hi> to that obiection of the points, maketh this answer: <hi>we had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
followe in this place the Greekes and Latines, quam Iudaeos pro sua libidine punctum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituentes,</hi>
then the Iewes setting the points according to their pleasure: but this is a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
answer: for if we make question of the Hebrewe pricks and points, we shall haue no
certaintie of the Scripture: therefore I rather answer with <hi>Polanus,</hi> that although the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
distinction <hi>athnah,</hi> be there set, yet the rest must be ioyned in sense, as the Angel at the
first maketh but one whole number of 70. weekes.</p>
                        <p>2. It followeth not, because when the citie was builded, the setled gouernement began,
that therefore the gouernours were this Messiah: And if Nehemiah were the first gouerno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>r,
as it cannot be denied, after the building of the citie: to the beginning of his gouernement,
there were not 7. weekes of yeares; seeing he was sent in the 20. of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> and there
continued to the 32. yeare, when according to his account the 49. yeares expired.</p>
                        <p>5. Wherefore the best and most receiued interpretation is, that by Messiah here, we are
to vnderstand our Blessed Sauiour Christ Iesus; as it may thus appeare. 1. one and the same
Messiah is spoken of through this prophesie: but the Messiah which should be slaine, and
confirme the couenant for one weeke, was Christ: therefore this Messiah here spoken of was
Christ. 2. the weekes before spoken of, to finish sinne, and reconcile iniquitie, could onely be
performed by Christ.</p>
                        <p>6. Some doe vnderstand by Messiah, Christ, and make this the sense, that 7. weekes, that
is, 49. yeares he should be their gouernour, and afterward cast them off: But it is euident,
that the Lord did not onely during those 7. weeks take vpon him the protection of that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
but many yeares after also.</p>
                        <p>7. Some obiect, that in that Messiah is called here a captaine or gouernour, if it were
meant of Christ, it would extenuate his dignitie: <hi>M. Calvin</hi> answereth, that therein the
dignitie and excellencie of Christ is set forth, who was a captaine ouer all other kings and
Princes: and this title is giuen also to kings, and to the chiefe earthly states; as Dauid is called
the captaine of the people, 2. Sam. 3. 2. and Hezekiah, 2. king. 20. 5. <hi>Pererius</hi> addeth
further, that this title, <hi>nagid,</hi> captaine, Prince, is particularly giuen vnto Christ, as Isay. 55.
4. <hi>I haue giuen him for a prince or captaine:</hi> for he was our captaine, 1. to lead vs by his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
example of life. 2. in teaching the way vnto saluation. 3. in gathering together his church,

that is, the citie, the words seeme to haue speciall reference to these troublesome times in
the first 7. weekes, wherein the worke of the Temple and citie were intermitted.</p>
                        <p>2. Some by the streightnes of time, vnderstand the short time, wherein the citie was
builded: for after it beganne to be reedified in the 2. yeare of Darius, it was finished in foure
yeare, <hi>Hug. Cardinal.</hi> but it is shewed before, that it was from the first to the last 46. yeare
in building, and therefore the 7. weekes are fingled from the rest, to note the streightnesse
and troubles of those times.</p>
                        <p>3. Some hauing speciall reference vnto the 7. weekes, doe vnderstand, onely the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome
building of the citie, because they hold the Temple to haue beene built before the
7. weekes beganne, so <hi>Bullinger, Iosephus Scalliger, Osian.</hi> as mention is made, Nehem. 4.
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:18834:165"/>
how they built with one hand, and held their swords in the other: But seeing the building
of the Temple was the principall worke, and was intermitted 46. yeares, it is not like that
it should be omitted in this prophesie.</p>
                        <p>4. Wherefore by building here in a trouble some time, is vnderstood the building of the
Temple and the citie: as <hi>Iunius</hi> in his <hi>commentarie,</hi> vnderstandeth the building of Ierusalem:

                        <p>8. Then it remaineth, that these 62. weekes must beginne where the 7. weekes ende,
in the 6. of Darius, and they ende at the last seuentie weeke, which beganne three yeares
and an halfe before the baptisme of Christ; and the other halfe is set apart for the holy prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
and Blessed passion of Christ. <hi>Bulling. H. Br.</hi> who both agree for the ende of these
62. weekes: but they differ in the beginning: <hi>M. Bullinger</hi> reckoneth the 62. weekes from
the 11. of <hi>Darius Nothus,</hi> and the 7. weekes from the 20. of <hi>Longimanus.</hi>

                        <p>9. <hi>Melancthon</hi> beginneth the 7. and 62. weekes, which make 69. in all, in the 2. of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimanus,</hi>

was not slaine, but as <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> writeth, <hi>lib. 5. Agrippa</hi> was confederate with
the Romanes: and <hi>Iosephus</hi> also testifieth, that he tooke part with the Romanes, after be
could not perswade the Iewes to giue ouer their intended warre: and that the said <hi>Agrippa</hi>
suruiued after the destruction of the citie. 2. Beside here is a great error in Chronologie;
for from the beginning of the 70. weekes, which he maketh 52. yeares before Cyrus, to
the destruction of Ierusalem, are in the most compendious reckoning almost 600. yeares.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Theodoret</hi> and <hi>Eusebius</hi> by the Messiah vnderstand <hi>Hyrcanus,</hi> who was the last anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
gouernour of the Priests, and after him the <hi>Herodians</hi> vsurped the kingly authoritie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the destruction of the citie: But the Messiah here spoken off, must reconcile iniquitie, and
finish sinne, but so could not any of the anointed Priests.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>M. Liuely</hi> by <hi>Messiah,</hi> taking the singular for the plurall, would haue meant the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed

were an vnproper speach, to take the last weeke for the Messiah: as they are forced thus to
interpret these words: after 62. weekes shall the Messiah be slaine, that is, in the 70. and

we shall haue many, and a succession rather of gouernours, then any one certain gouernour,
in which sense, I thinke, it cannot be shewed, that the word (Messiah) is taken throughout
the whole Scripture. 2. and by this exposition of (Messiah) we are depriued of one of the
most pregnant prophesies of Christs holy passion. 3. neither doth it follow, that the 70.
weeke in that sense should be taken for the Messiah, no more then he himselfe taketh it,
where he saith, that <hi>after 69. weekes counted from the commandement, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

likewise vnderstand the 70. weeke after the 69. wherein the Messiah should be cut off? 4.
euen to admit his owne sense, the lawfull anointed gouernours ceased in Ierusalem long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

answeareth, that this prophesie was rather fulfilled in the destruction of Ierusalem, which
he calleth the beginning of Christs second comming to iudgement, the ende and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:18834:166"/>
whereof shall be in the last day of iudgement: and therefore all the time after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
is called the last daies: and this is the reason why our Sauiour, Matth. 14. treateth in the
same place of the destruction of Ierusalem, and of the end of the world. So M. <hi>Lively, p.</hi> 251.</p>
                        <p>But 1. this is a strange exposition, to vnderstand Christs comming in the flesh, when he
was gone out of the world, and to make his going his comming. 2. Iacob prophesieth of
the first comming of Christ in the flesh, as <hi>Iunius</hi> noteth out of the word <hi>Shilob<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> which he
interpreteth, <hi>her sonne,</hi> the word properly signifying the matrice or wombe: because Christ
was borne of a woman without the helpe of man, <hi>Iun. annot. in Gen.</hi> 49. 3. The reason
why our Sauiour treateth of both those questions together is, because the Apostles had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
two questions, both of the time of the destruction of the citie and Temple, and of
the ende of the world: for thus they say, <hi>Tell vs, when these things shall be, and what signe
shall be of thy comming, and of the ende of the world,</hi> Matth. 24. 3. therefore our Sauiour satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
them in both their demands. 4. These very words last rehearsed shew, that the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
comming of Christ, and the ende of the world should be ioyned together.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Iunius,</hi> who vnderstandeth this place of the true Messiah, yet referreth the ende of
these 70. weekes to the destruction of the citie, is forced to vse a kind of <hi>zeugmatical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,</hi>
as he calleth it, by supplying the word <hi>after</hi> in this sense, <hi>after 62. weekes,</hi> after, <hi>the
Messiah is slaine:</hi> so also <hi>Polanus:</hi> which words they thus interpret, not that after the 62.
weekes the Messiah should be cut off: but after such time as the Messiah should be slaine,
which was within the 69. weekes, and after the said 62. weekes, then should follow the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of the citie. But who seeth not, how in this exposition the text is strained: for the
nominatiue is turned into the accusatiue, <hi>after the Messiah slaine,</hi> or the ablatiue, <hi>the Messiah
beeing slaine:</hi> and the word <hi>after</hi> is inserted, which is not in the text. And the very first rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the words, <hi>after 62. weekes the Messiah shall be slaine,</hi> doe euidently giue this sense,
that after that time, and not before, he should be slaine.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi>Iunius</hi> hath an other interpretation in his <hi>annotations,</hi> shewing the accomplishment
hereof in the members of Christ, how that after the Messiah himselfe was slaine, his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
were persecuted: for in the ende of the 69. weeke, about the 7. yeare of Nero, Iames
was put to death, and a grieuous persecution was raised against the Church: But the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
and seruants of the Messiah, can not be the Messiah: and this cutting off must be after
the 69. weekes, not in any part of them: neither as is shewed before, doth the 69. weeke ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to the 7. of Nero, beeing expired before the baptisme of Christ.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi>Oecolampad.</hi> yeeldeth this as a reason, why this cutting off can not in his iudgement
be referred to the death of Christ; because the word signifieth, so to cut off, as the thing cut
off be in a manner extinguished and perisheth: but so was not Christ cut off, who hanging
vpon the crosse, was written in the superscription king of the Iewes: But <hi>M. Calvin.</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth
this obiection well, <hi>qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

this was true according to the common sense, because men thought that Christ
was wholly abolished: So that he was in the opinion of men, as quite cut off, as the Prophet
Isay faith, <hi>c. 53. 8. he was cut out of the land of the liuing.</hi> 2. And the word here vsed <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

signifieth to cut off either by death or banishment, as Amos. 1. 5. <hi>I will cut off the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit

an off, that is, slaine.</p>
                        <p>7. Wherefore the plaine and proper meaning of these words is, that after these weekes
the Messiah out Blessed Sauiour should be put to death for our sinnes: And this is an euident
proofe of this sense: because it is said, v. 27. <hi>He shall confirme the conenant,</hi> which euen in <hi>M.
Liuelies</hi> iudgement is vnderstood of the Messiah, p. 218. Then the Messiah, to whom this
word (he) hath reference vnto, must be expressed, and spoken of before.</p>

death shall haue no power vpon him, neither for all this, shall his iudgements be staied,
which he purposed to bring vpon the citie.</p>

3. In his last <hi>edition,</hi> in his annotations, and in his commentarie, he thus expoundeth: that
all shall depart from him, he shall not haue in Ierusalem any disciple: for a little before the
besieging of the citie, they of the Church were admonished by reuelation to goe out of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem
vnto a towne in <hi>Petrea</hi> called <hi>Pella. Euseb. l. 3. hist. Eccl. c.</hi> 5.</p>
                        <p>4. Not much differing here-from, is the interpretation of <hi>Lyranus, Hugo, Pintus,</hi> with
others, following the Latine translation: <hi>non erit ei populus qui eum negaturus est,</hi> they shall
not be his people, which denied him: for the Iewes said they had no king but Cesar, Ioh: 19.
15. and <hi>as for this man</hi> (say they) <hi>we know not whence he is,</hi> Ioh. 9. 29.</p>
                        <p>5. M. <hi>Calvin</hi> thus interpreteth, <hi>nihil ei erit,</hi> he shall haue nothing: so also <hi>Genevens.</hi> that
is, he shall haue a contemptible death, and be counted as nothing: as the Prophet Isai saith,

                        <p>There are three accounts to finde out the birth of Christ: 1. by the Romane Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,
2. by the Greeke Olympiads, 3. by the Hebrewes computation.</p>
                        <p>1. The Romane account of yeares, is either by the yeares of the building of Rome, by
the Consuls, or by the yeares of the Emperours: for the yeares of the citie, <hi>Pererius</hi> casteth
the time of Christs birth into the 752. yeare, which he prooueth out of <hi>Dions</hi> Chronologie,
who placeth the 15. yeare of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> when Christ at 30. yeares was baptized, in the 782.
yeare. But therein he is somewhat deceiued: for setting the 1. yeare of Christ in the 752. of
the citie, in the 782. beginneth the 31. yeare of Christ, as M. <hi>Bullinger</hi> casteth it: and the 15.
yeare of <hi>Tiberius</hi> was in the 781. yeare. M. <hi>Lively</hi> in his table setteth downe the birth of
Christ in the 751. yeare: but the receiued opinion is, that it was in the 752. yeare. which was
the 42. of <hi>Augustus</hi> raigne.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the computation by the yeares of the Consuls, it is vncertaine. <hi>Sulpitius</hi>
thinketh, that <hi>Sabinus</hi> and <hi>Ruffinus</hi> were then Consuls, <hi>lib. 2. sacr. histor. Cassiodorus</hi> nameth
<hi>C. Lentulus,</hi> and <hi>M. M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ssalinus:</hi> but these are placed by others in the 749. yeare, not the
752. of the citie. <hi>Onuphrius in chronie.</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius in hares.</hi> 51. and <hi>Eusebius in chronic.</hi>
doe hold, that <hi>Augustus</hi> was the 13. time Consul, and <hi>Syllanus;</hi> when Christ was borne:
which <hi>Carolus Sigonius</hi> in his commentaries agreeth vnto, as the most probable: yet M.
<hi>Liuely</hi> setteth them in the yeare of the citie 750. the yeare before he supposeth Christ to
haue beene borne. This account then by Consuls we leaue as vncertaine.</p>
                        <p>The surer way then by the Romane computation, is to count by the yeares of the raigne
of the Emperours. <hi>Augustus Cesar</hi> is held to haue liued 75. yeares, and 10. moneths, and 20.
daies, beeing borne as <hi>Dio</hi> doth cast his natiuitie, in the yeare of the citie 691. and ending
his life in the yeare 767. But others doe place his birth in the yeare of the citie 689. as <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropius
lib.</hi> 6. and <hi>Orosius lib.</hi> 6. when <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Antonie</hi> were Consuls together, which was
in the yeare 689. <hi>Bulling. M. Lively.</hi> by this latter account <hi>Augustus</hi> should be two yeare
elder: and so liued in all 77. yeares, and odde moneths. But <hi>Plinie</hi> is wide, who placeth the
Consulship of <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Antonie,</hi> in the 700. yeare, which should be aboue tenne yeares
after, <hi>lib. 9. c.</hi> 39.</p>
                        <p>Now for the time of his gouernment: he raigned alone after he had ouercome <hi>Antonie</hi>
at <hi>Actium,</hi> 44. yeares: 12. he had the ioynt gouernment with Antonie: so that from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of his first Consulship and regiment, he gouerned 56. yeares, some say 58. yeares,
<hi>Tacit. dialog. de clar. oratorib.</hi> some 57. as <hi>Iosephus</hi> counteth, <hi>l. 18. c.</hi> 3. but the most Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologers
agree that he raigned in all 56. yeares, 6. moneths: so <hi>Epiphan. in Anchorat.</hi> and
<hi>Beda, lib. de 6. at<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>tib. Fererius</hi> thinketh he raigned not full out 56. the difference is not
great.</p>
                        <p>The yeare then of Christs birth compared with <hi>Augustus</hi> raigne, beeing in the 752. yeare
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:18834:167"/>
of the citie, falleth out to be in the 42. yeare of <hi>Augustus</hi> sole gouernment, the 62. of his
age, and the 30. yeare after the conquest of <hi>Antonie. Beda</hi> thinketh it was the 27. yeare: so
also <hi>Ioseph. Scalig. Clemens</hi> the 28. <hi>lib. 1. stromat. Onuphrius</hi> the 29. but it was the 30. yeare
iust from the victorie of <hi>Antonie:</hi> which was the 42. yeare from the beginning of <hi>Augustus</hi>
first Consulship, as it may be thus gathered: Christ in the 15. yeare of Tiberius Cesar, was
30. yeare old, Luk. 3. 1. 23. then put vnto that number 15. more of <hi>Augustus</hi> 56. and we shal
come iust to the 42. yeare of <hi>Augustus.</hi> Thus much of the Latine computation.</p>
                        <p>2. By the computation of the Greeke Olympiads, Christs birth fell out in the 3. yeare of
the 194. Olympiad, as <hi>Eusebius in chronic.</hi> and <hi>Beda, lib; de 6. aetat.</hi> and <hi>Iosep. Scalig.</hi> so also M.
<hi>Lively:</hi> but other cast it to be in the 4. yeare of the 194. Olympiad, <hi>Bulling. Perer.</hi> and their
reason is this, because they hold Christ to haue died in the 33. yeare of his age, in the 4.
yeare of the 202. Olympiad: by which account his birth will fall out in the 4. of the 194. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympiad.
Here <hi>Cyril. Hycrosol.</hi> is found to be in a great error, who affirmeth, <hi>catech.</hi> 12. that
Christ was borne in the 4. yeare of the 186. Olympiad, which was aboue 30. yeares before,
so that by this reckoning Christ in the 15. yeare of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> when he was baptized, should
be aboue 60. yeares old.</p>

                        <p>3. We will come now to the Iewes computation, which is either by the casting of the
yeare of the world, or by the yeares of their kings and gouernours: other waies they haue to
recken by, but these are most pertinent to this busines in hand.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi>Pererius</hi> counteth from the beginning of the world, to the birth of Christ 4022.
yeares, which summe he thus collecteth by parcels.</p>
                        <p>From the creation to the flood, were yeares a 1656. as may be gathered, Gen. 5. by the
age of the fathers: then he reckoneth from the flood, to the birth of <hi>Abraham,</hi> counting 30.
yeares for <hi>Cainan,</hi> 322. from the birth of <hi>Abraham</hi> vnto the Promise 75. Gen. 12. from the

480. 1. king. 6. 1. then to the beginning of the Olympiads in the 8. yeare of Ahaz, 283.
and from the 1. Olympiad to the 4. yeare of the 194. Olympiad, wherein Christ was borne
776. yeares: all these summes laid together from the beginning of the world, to the birth of
Christ, he summeth to 4022. yeares in all.</p>
                        <p>But <hi>Pererius</hi> diuersly faileth in this his reckoning. 1. for in the second summe from the
flood to <hi>Abrahams</hi> birth, he committeth two great errors: for 1. he counteth 30. yeares
for <hi>Caynan,</hi> which is not in the originall, but onely in the <hi>Septuagint.</hi> 2. and beside, he rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koneth
but 292. yeares, supposing <hi>Abraham</hi> to haue beene borne in the 70. yeare of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
age, whereas he was borne in the 130. yeare: for he was but 75. yeare old when his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was 205. so that from the flood to <hi>Abrahams</hi> birth, were 352. yeares: he then with
forged <hi>Cainans</hi> 30. making but 322. yeares, wanteth yet 30. more of the iust reckoning. 3.
further, he setteth the beginning of the Olympiads in the 8. yeare of Ahaz, whereas it is
more probable they beganne 23. yeares before, in the 2. yeare of Iotham: here then he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
23. yeares too late. 4. and in his last summe of 776. he ouerreacheth aboue an 100.
yeares, for from Ahaz 8. yeare to the 11. of Iehoiakim, when the captiuitie beganne, are but
an 134. yeares, as may be gathered by the seuerall yeares of the raignes of the kings of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah:
from thence to Cyrus 70. from Cyrus first to the passion of Christ 490. from which
summe must be diducted 33. years from the passion of Christ to his birth; the whole summe
is but 661.</p>
                        <p>2. Let vs then further see, how these yeares from the beginning of the world, vnto the
birth of Christ, are otherwise summed. The chronologie and computation of yeares, added
in the ende of the <hi>Genevean</hi> translation, counteth from Adam to Christs incarnation 4017.
yeares, which they gather thus:</p>
                        <p>From the creation to the flood, 1656. from the flood to Abrahams departing from Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
423. from Abrahams departing thence to the departing of Israel out of Egypt, 430. from
thence to the building of the Temple, 480. from thence to the captiuitie of Babylon in the
11. yeare of Zedekiah, 441. then to the building againe of Ierusalem, 143. from thence to
Christs death, 478. The whole summe is 4051. from whence 33. yeares and an halfe bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

captiuitie, make vp the 70. yeares, and 490. which put together, make 549. So that they doe
exceed in these two last summes, almost 90. yeares: but they differ more in the whole summe
from the creation to the natiuitie, as shall be shewed in the true computation.</p>

The whole summe of these yeares put together, amounteth to 4053. from which summe if
73. years be diducted from the birth of Christ, to the destruction of the citie, (33. to his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and 40. thence to the ende of the citie) there will remaine from the creation of the
world, to the natiuitie of our Sauiour, 3980. yeares. In which summe, two things may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
against: 1. in the yeares ending in the 11. of Zedekiah, which are cast to 3398. there
want iust 22. yeares: for the 11. of Zedekiah was in the yeare of the world 3420. and the
cause of the fayling is this: <hi>Iunius</hi> giueth but vnto Amaziah. 17. yeares, and then immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to Vzziah or Azariah 52. for he thinketh, that whereas the storie saith, that Amaziah raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
29. yeares, the last 12. he spent in a priuate life, and so those yeares are counted to his
sonnes raigne: thus <hi>Iun. annot.</hi> 2. king. 14. 2. &amp; 21. But it is more agreeable to the text, that
Amaziah raigned 29. yeares, and then his sonne succeeded not immediatly, as <hi>Oecolampad.</hi>
setteth him; but there was an <hi>interregnum,</hi> or intermission of the raigne, for eleuen yeares,
the kingdome beeing gouerned by the States: as it may thus be gathered: <hi>Amaziah</hi> liued
15. yeares after the death of Ioash king of Israel, in whose 15. yeare beganne Ieroboam the
sonne of Ioash to raigne ouer Israel, 2. king. 14. 17. 23. so then of Amaziahs 29. yeare, there
remained yet 15. then in the 15. yeare of Ieroboam Amaziahs raigne endeth: afterward in
the 27. yeare of Ieroboam, beganne Vzziah to raigne: then must needes the kingdome lie
void eleuen yeares from the 15. of Ieroboam to the 27. <hi>H. Br. Concent. Genevens.</hi> And it can
not stand, that Vzziah raigned together with his father: for he was but 16. yeare olde
when he beganne to raigne, which was in the 27. of Ieroboam, 2. king. 15. 1, 2. whereas his
father died in the 15. yeare of Ieroboam, when Vzziah was by this account but 4. yere old.
And it is noted in direct words, that as soone as Azariah was made king in his fathers stead,
he built Elath, after his father had slept with his fathers, 2. king. 14. 21, 22. So it is euident,
that <hi>Iunius</hi> making Vzziah to beginne to raigne immediatly after the 17. yeare of Amazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,
commeth short of the iust summe 22. or 23. yeares: for he leaueth out 12. yeares of Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziahs
raigne, and omitteth the time of the vacancie, which was eleuen yeares more.</p>
                        <p>2. In that <hi>Iunius</hi> counteth an 106. yeares from Cyrus 1. to the 2. of Darius, when the

                        <p>7. Thus then may the yeare of the world be found out, wherein our blessed Sauiour was
borne: first we take the number before set downe by <hi>Iun. artic.</hi> 4. vnto the destruction of
Ierusalem in the 11. of Zedekiah, which is iust by true account found to be 3398. yeares, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
that there wanteth 22. to be added, which <hi>Iunius</hi> cutteth off from the raigne of Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah,
to whome he giueth but 17. yeares, whereas he raigned 29. and from the time of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancie
of the kingdome which was 11. yeares, as is there shewed: adde these 22. yeares to
the former summe, and we shall haue iust 3420. yeares, from the creation to the desolation
of Ierusalem in the 11. of Zedekiah: from hence to the death of our blessed Sauiour there
are two accounts: Some counting the beginning of the captiuitie in the 1. yeare of Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzer,
and the 4. of Iehoiakim, when Daniel was carried away captiue, (and Ierusalem
was destroied in the 19. yeare of Nabuchadnezzer) doe make reckoning but of 50. yeares
more to Cyrus 1. and thence to Christs death 490. yeares: so that the yeare of the world by
this account was 3960. at the holy passion of Christ: and 33. yeares beeing abated for the
age of Christ, his natiuitie shall be in the yeare of the world 3927. or thereabout, <hi>H. Br.</hi> in
his Concent. But because the better opinion is and more probable, to beginne the 70. years
in the captiuitie of Iechoniah in the 8. yeare of Nabuchadnezzer,<note place="margin">See more for the beginning of the 70. yeares captiuitie, qu. 5. vpon this chap.</note> from whence <hi>Ieremie</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth
it, c. 29. 10. as <hi>Iosephus Scaliger</hi> sheweth, <hi>lib. 6. de emendat. tempor.</hi> we must adde 8.
yeares more to the foresaid number, because we beginne the captiuitie later, and so these 8.
yeares beeing added, we haue the 3935. yeare of the world for the birth of our blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour.</p>
                        <p>But it will be obiected, that whereas the yeare wherein our blessed Sauiour suffered, is
held to haue beene a yeare of Iubile, the 28. Iubile beeing cast vp to fall in the yeare of the
world 3960. his birth beeing placed in the yeare 3927. we shall by adding of 8. yeares
more misse of a yeare of Iubile in the yeare of Christs passion. We answer, that they which
cast the 28. Iubile to be in the yeare 3960. beginne the first Iubile in the 8. yeare of Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shuahs
gouernment, <hi>H. Br.</hi> which may better take beginning 8. yeares after in the 16. of Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shuah,
when he gathered all Israel to Sechem, and made a couenant with them: for then the
people had rest from their enemies, Iosh. 24. 1.</p>
                        <p>8. <hi>M. Lydyat</hi> placeth the birth of Christ in the yeare of the world 4007. and so exceedeth
the former reckoning by 72. yeares: the reason of which difference is, because he giueth 204
yeares to the Persian Monarchie, beginning the same in the yeare 3471. and ending in the
yeare 3675. whereas it is prooued before, that the Persian Monarchie could not exceede an
130. yeares, or thereabout, qu. 43.</p>

                        <p>But this opinion of <hi>Iosephus</hi> can not stand. 1. for if Herod beganne to raigne in the
184. Olympiad, he must die in the 193. Olympiad, which was 37. yeares after: and then
should Christ be borne 7. or 8. yeares after the raigne of Herod, namely in the 4. yeare of the
194. Olympiad, which is contrarie to the historie of the Gospel, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. for Herod died
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:18834:169"/>

the beginning of the 191. Olympiad. 3. <hi>Dio lib.</hi> 48. and <hi>Onuphrius in chron.</hi> doe place the
Consulship of <hi>Cn. Calvinus,</hi> and <hi>Asiaius Pollio.</hi> in the 2. yeare of the 185. Olympiad,
which was the 714. yeare of the building of Rome.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Onuphrius in chronic.</hi> assigneth the beginning of Herods raigne to the 3. yeare of
<hi>Augustus Caesar: Beda lib. de 6. aetatibus,</hi> to the 11 yeare: But <hi>Eusebius</hi> more truely in the

                        <p>5. <hi>Iosephus Scaliger</hi> is confident, that Christ was borne in the 37. yeare of Herod,
which he would prooue thus. 1. the beginning of Herods raigne was in the next yeare after
the Consulship of <hi>Calvinus</hi> and <hi>Pollio</hi> (which was in the 714. yeare of the citie, as <hi>Dio</hi> and
<hi>Onuphrius</hi> cast it) this was in the 15. yeare of <hi>Augustus,</hi> which was the 715. yeare of
Rome: from hence to the 42. yeare of <hi>Augustus,</hi> are 37. yeares: then by this reckoning the
37. of Herod, and the 31. of <hi>Augustus,</hi> and the 3. yeare of the 194. Olympiad shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre
together.</p>
                        <p>2. Christ was then newely borne, when the wisemen came to worship, for as yet the
time of purification was not come according to the law: for to what ende els should Marie
stay in Bethlehem? the starre appeared before the conception of Christ, 1. yeare before
Christs birth, and they so cast their iourney, as that they came presently after the birth of
Christ: Now Christ immediately after his mother was purified, was carried into Egypt, and
after a while Herod died, and then he returned out of Egypt: to this purpose, <hi>Ioseph. Scalig.
lib. 6. de emendat. tempor.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. There were two beginnings of Herods raigne, one from the time of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
king, which might be in the 4. or 5. of <hi>Augustus</hi> raigne, in the 714. or 15. yeare of
Rome: but an other beginning was after the death of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> when he tooke possession
of his kingdome, which was as <hi>Eusebius</hi> setteth it, in the 10. yeare of <hi>Augustus,</hi> as <hi>Beda</hi> in
the 11. yeare: from this latter beginning must the 37. yeares of Herods raigne be counted,
and not from the first.</p>
                        <p>2. Concerning the time of the appearing of the starre, and of the comming of the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:
1. I neither thinke that Christ was two yeare old at such time as the infants were kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
as <hi>Aretius</hi> thinketh in his commentaries vpon Matthew, and M. <hi>Calvin,</hi> that Herod
deferred the execution of his malice almost two yeares: for by the text it appeareth, that as
soone as Herod sawe himselfe mocked of the wisemen, he forthwith in his rage caused the
infants to be killed, Matth. 1. 16. 2. neither is it like that the starre appeared 1. yeare;
or 2. before Christs natiuitie: for how then should the wisemen haue knowne when to set
forward, and to come iust against the natiutie of Christ, if the starre had appeared so long
before, and not at, and after the birth of Christ. 3. Therefore it is more probable, that the
wisemen vpon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

toward the ende of the dayes of Maries purification, and returned backe againe, Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then newly borne; for otherwise Marie would not haue staied in Bethlem: she might
continue there 40. dayes; in the ende whereof the wisemen might come from the East,<note place="margin">At what time the starre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to the wisemen that came from the East, Matth. 2.</note> not
from Chaldea, which was North, from Ierusalem, nor from Persia, which was too farre off,
beeing fowre moneths iourney, Ezra. 7. 9. But as <hi>Pellican</hi> thinketh, they might come from
some nearer countrey, as <hi>Sabea,</hi> which was counted in the East countries toward the South:
so that toward the ende of the 40. dayes of purification, they might well accomplish their
iourney: and in the meane time as they returned, while Herod expected their returne, Marie
went to Ierusalem to be purified. 4. neither doth it followe, that they fleeing into Egypt,
should make aboad there but certaine moneths: some thinke they might stay there 5. yeares,
<hi>Emman. Sa.</hi> some 7. <hi>ex Pellicano.</hi> there is no certaintie of the time of their aboad there,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:18834:170"/>
they stayed till Herod was dead. 5. And whereas Herod in his rage caused the infants to be
killed, <hi>from two yeare old and vnder, according to the time which he had diligently enquired of
the wisemen,</hi> it followeth not, that this was the second yeare of the appearing of the starre,
as <hi>Iosephus Scaliger</hi> inferreth: But Herod to be sure, that the childe should not escape, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
all to the sword from a day old to two yeare old, so <hi>Pellican.</hi> so that these words, <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the time,</hi> may as well be referred to those which were vnder two yeare old, though
they were but a day, or a moneth, or two olde, as to those which were fully two yeare old.</p>
                        <p>5. Wherefore although there be no certaintie of this, in what yeare of Herods raigne
Christ was borne, neither is it necessarie for the vnderstanding of Daniels weekes; yet it is
most probable, that our Blessed Sauiour was borne about the 30. of Herod complet, and the
31. begunne, which falleth into the 41. yeare of the raigne of <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> complete,
and the 42. begunne, as it may be thus gathered: the Herodians are held to haue continued
in the gouernement of Iudea, to the destruction of Ierusalem 103. yeares, which may be
counted thus by the particular account of the yeares of the Herodians: <hi>Herod</hi> the sonne of
<hi>Antipater,</hi> raigned 37. <hi>Herod Archelaus 9. Herod</hi> the Tetrach 24. <hi>Herod Agrippa 7. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa</hi>
the sonne of <hi>Agrippa, 26. Oecol.</hi> these yeares ending at the destruction of Ierusalem
in the 2. of <hi>Vespasian,</hi> make an 103. Then counting backeward from the destruction of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem
73. yeares, we shall come iust to the 42. of <hi>Augustus,</hi> and to the 31. yeare of Herod,
as may euidently appeare to those, that will compare the yeares of the Emperours, and lay
them together. I therefore thinke <hi>Beda</hi> his opinion of the rest most probable, who placeth
the beginning of Herods raigne in the 11. yeare of <hi>Augustus,</hi> and the birth of Christ in 31.
of Herod, which by this reckoning falleth into the 41. of <hi>Augustus</hi> complete, or the 42.
yeare begunne.</p>
                        <p>And as there is small certaintie in what yeare of Herod Christ was borne, so neither is it
agreed vpon by all, into what yeare of <hi>Augustus</hi> raigne Christs birth should fall. <hi>Cassiodorus</hi>
assigneth the 40. yeare,<note place="margin">Iren. lib. 3. ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. haeres. c. 25. Tertul. lib. aduers. Iudaeos.</note>

                        <p>1. Some are of opinion, that Christ was 30. yeares complete before he was baptized:
of which opinion was Beda, that Christ was baptized the 6. of Ianuarie, 13. dayes after he
was full 30. yeare old, <hi>lib. de ration. temp.</hi> c. 41. So also <hi>Chrysostome hom. 10. in Matth.

                        <p>2. An other opinion is, that Christ when he was baptized was onely entred into his 30.
yeare, about some 13. dayes: so <hi>Pererius</hi> vrging the strict words of Luke, that Christ began
then to be about 30. yeare old: and maketh <hi>Ireneus</hi> with others to fauour this opinion; the
first thus writeth, <hi>lib. 2. aduers. haeres<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> c. 39. Ad baptismum venit, &amp;c. he came to baptisme
not hauing yet fulfilled 30. yeares, but beginning to be about 30. yeare old, as</hi> S. Luke signifieth.
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:18834:170"/>
                           <hi>Pererius</hi> iudgement here is agreeable to the words of the text, sauing that he holdeth
Christ to haue beene borne in December, whereas there must be 3. yeares and an halfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
Chists baptisme and his passion, as is shewed afterward.</p>
                        <p>3. A third opinion is of <hi>Epiphanius, haeres.</hi> 50. that Christ was 30. yeares old within two
moneths: whom he holdeth to haue beene borne vpon the sixt day of Ianuarie, and to haue
beene baptized in his 30. yeare, two moneths before the ende thereof about the sixt of
Nouember: But the word, <hi>beginning,</hi> which S. Luke vseth, sheweth that he was toward the
beginning rather then the ende of his 30. yeare.</p>
                        <p>4. Wherefore it is more probable, that Christ was baptized in the beginning, not in the
ende of his 30. yeare, in the sixt moneth <hi>Tisri,</hi> whereof this reason may be yeelded out of
Daniel, because Christs death ended halfe of a weeke, wherein the couenant was confirmed,
which beganne at his preaching, immediately after his baptisme, <hi>H. Br. Concent.</hi> And if
the 70. weekes must ende iust at the death of Christ, as is prooued before quest. 49. and
Christ beginning to preach immediately after his baptisme, preached 3. yeares and an halfe,
it must followe, that he was baptized in the beginning of his 30. yeare: And in this sense
Christ is said in proper speaking to be thirtie yeare old, when he was but entring into his
thirtie yeare, see more hereof quest. 71. and 72. following.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi>M. Lydyat</hi> thinketh that Christ <hi>dimidia ex parte exegerat annum aetatis tricesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum,</hi>
had passed the halfe of his 30. yeare, when he was baptised, and the word <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>,
<hi>beginning,</hi> he referreth to his preaching, not to his age. But I encline rather to the former o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.
1. for there is no mention made at all of Christs preaching, in respect whereof he
should be said to beginne: the words doe thus stand in the text, <hi>and Iesus himselfe was as it
were of thirtie yeares beginning, &amp;c.</hi> 2. neither did Christ immediately after his baptisme
beginne to preach: he was first tempted. 40. dayes in the wildernes, next after his baptisme,
as S. Luke sheweth in the next chapter. 3. and if Christ were baptised in the middest of his
30. yeare, and after that liued 3. yeares and an halfe, beeing put to death in the spring, it
will followe, that he was also borne about that time of the yeare, which is also <hi>M. Lydyats</hi>
opinion, which is verie improbable, as shall be shewed afterward quest. 71. following.</p>
                        <p>6. But <hi>M. Lydyat</hi> hath yet a more strange opinion: he thinketh that Iohn Baptist began
to preach 4. yeares before Christ was baptised, in the 15. yeare of <hi>Tiberius</hi> raigne; and that
Christ was baptised in the beginning of the 19. yeare of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and suffred in the 22. yeare:
his chiefe reasons are these.</p>
                        <p>1. There are 30. yeares, at what age Christ was baptised, from the 41. of <hi>Augustus,</hi>
wherein Christ was borne, to the 19. of <hi>Tiberius.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. The Temple was in building 46. yeares, Ioh. 2. which beganne to be built in the 18.
yeare of Herod, whence vnto the 15. yeare (he would say 19. yeare) of <hi>Tiberius</hi> are 47.
yeares.</p>
                        <p>3. Iohn was not imprisoned and put to death before the 20. and 21. of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
after Iohns beheading, followed the battell betweene Herod and Aretas king of Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia,
for repudiating his daughter, and marying Herodias his brothers wife, which was in
the beginning of <hi>Vitellius</hi> gouernement: which was in the 21. yeare of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> as <hi>Cornel.
Tacitus</hi> testifieth, <hi>lib. 6. Annal.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. The yeare wherein Christ beganne to preach was a sabbaticall yeare, as appeareth
Luk. 4. but there was no sabbaticall yeare, after the 15. yeare of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> till the 20. To
this purpose <hi>M. Lydyat lib. de emendat. tempor.</hi> from p. 169. to p. 176.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> Though I will not of purpose oppose my selfe to so excellent a Chronologer,
who hath taken great paines in this kind of studie, which I professe not; yet because that his
opinion is singular, I hope I may without offence examine his reasons, to giue him occasion
further to consider of them, least the common aduersarie might take aduantage thereby.</p>
                        <p>1. The 30. yeares of Christs age were expired in the 15. yeare of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> from the 41.
of <hi>Augustus</hi> wherein Christ is held to haue beene borne: and <hi>M. Lydyat</hi> maketh mention
of one <hi>Petavius</hi> a learned Chronologer of Paris, who prooueth that Christ must be borne
30. yeares before the 15. yeare <hi>Tiberius,</hi> p. 153.</p>
                        <p>2. That place in Ioh. c. 2. must be vnderstood of the building of <hi>Zorobabels</hi> Temple,
not of Herods, as hath beene shewed before, quest. 58.</p>
                        <p>3. Iohns troubles beganne before the 20. yeare of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> for when Herod tooke his
brother Philips wife Herodias, his brother was then liuing, at what time Iohn reprooued
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:18834:171"/>
him: but Philip died in the 20. yeare of <hi>Tiberius, Ioseph. lib. 18. c.</hi> 6. and the warre vpon
that occasion might followe some yeare after.</p>
                        <p>4. That yeare wherein Christ preached was not a sabbaticall yeare: Christ prepareth them
by his preaching against the acceptable yeare, which was that wherein he suffred, which was
both a sabbaticall and Iubile yeare: for the Iubile beeing a type of Christ, in whom we
should enioy the true Iubile, in the remission of sinnes, the figure and shadowe and the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
must agree together.</p>
                        <p>5. But that Christ was baptized in the 15. yeare of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> S. Luke putteth it out of
doubt, c. 3. 1. <hi>M. Lydyat</hi> answereth that the Euangelist assigneth that yeare for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of Iohns preaching, not for Christs baptisme: for Iohn must haue a longer time
giuen him then so to prepare the way for Christs to preach and baptize, p. 171. But as Iohn
Baptists birth was but 6. moneths before Christs, so the like time might suffice for his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>running
in preaching: the Euangelists set downe the baptisme of our Blessed Sauiour, as
following immediately vpon the preaching of Iohn: yea S. Iohn saith, that the next day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his solemne baptizing, he saw Iesus comming vnto him, Iohn. 1. 29.</p>
                     </div>

                        <head>Quest. 69. How many yeares Christ liued on earth, and in what yeare
of his life Christ was put to death.</head>
                        <p>1. Some were of opinion, that Christ liued 46. yeares at the least, that the bodie may
answer to the shadowe, the substance to the figure, because the materiall Temple, which
was a figure of the true Temple Christ Iesus, is said to haue beene 46. yeare in building:
<hi>Ireneus</hi> thinketh that Christ liued 50. yeares, because of that place, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. where the Iewes
say vnto Christ, <hi>thou art not yet 50. yeare old, &amp;c.</hi> And he further addeth this reason, that
it was not fit that Christ should beginne to preach in his youth, but should take that graue
function vpon him, when he grewe in yeares, <hi>Irenaeus lib. 2. aduers. haeres. cap.</hi> 39.</p>
                        <p>But 1. the Iewes words (speaking but by gesse) are not much to be weighed, though
some in that place doe reade <hi>fourtie</hi> for fifty, <hi>Chrysost.</hi> 2. there may be as great grauitie in
young yeares, as in age: for not yeares, but the graces and gifts of Gods spirit doe bring
authoritie. 3. And if Christ had liued so many yeares, it is not like that the Euangelistes
would haue passed ouer in silence the great workes which Christ did in that time, whereas
they onely set downe those things, which Christ spake and did vnto the 4. Passeouer after
his baptisme, which was in the 30. yeare of his age. 2. If Christ had liued aboue 40. toward
50. yeares, he could not haue suffred vnder <hi>Tiberius,</hi> in whose 18. yeare he is generally held
to haue died, beeing baptized in his 15. yeare, Luk. 3. 1. for <hi>Tiberius</hi> raigned but 23. yeares
in all.</p>
                        <p>2. An other opinion is that Christ died the same yeare, namely the 30. complete where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he was baptized, and so preached but one yeare, so <hi>Tertullian lib. aduers. Iudaeos,</hi> and
<hi>Clemens Alexandrin. lib. 1. stromat.</hi> who groundeth his opinion vpon that place taken out
of the Prophet, Luk. 4. 19. <hi>that he should preach the acceptable yeare of the Lord:</hi> But 1. it
followeth not, because mention is made of the acceptable yeare in the singular, that Christ
peached but one yeare in all: <hi>yeare</hi> is here taken either generally for the acceptable time, or
it hath speciall reference to that true Iubile, the yeare of remission wherein Christ suffred for
our sinnes. 2. in the Euangelists there is mention made of fowre seuerall Passeouers after
Christs baptisme, as shall be euen now shewed: therefore Christ liued and preached aboue a
yeare after his baptisme.</p>
                        <p>3. Some other thinke that Christ liued but 31. yeares, and preached but two yeares
after his baptisme: of this opinion was <hi>Apollinaris</hi> Bishop of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> as <hi>Hierome</hi> reporteth
<hi>in 9. Daniel.</hi> and <hi>Cyrillus Alexandrin.</hi> seemeth to affirme the same, <hi>in 29. c. Isaiae, Seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus
Sulpitius</hi> also <hi>lib. 2. sacr. histor.</hi> seemeth to be of the same iudgement, who writeth that
Christ liued 4. yeares of Herods raigne, and 9. yeares of <hi>Archelaus,</hi> and then died in the
18. yeare of Herod the Tetrach, all which make but 31. yeares. This opinion is refelled
by the former reason: because the Euangelists make mention in the Gospel of 4. Passeouers
after Christs baptisme, which could not be in the space of two yeares.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Iosephus Scaliger</hi> is of opinion that Christ suffred in the 35. yeare of his age, holding
that Christ was baptised in the beginning of his 31. yeare, and after his baptisme mention
is made of fiue Pasches, the first Ioh. 2. 13. the second Iohn 5. 1. the third, Matth. 12. 1.
and Luk. 6. 1. when the Apostles plucked the eares of corne, which was as S. Luke saith,
the second Sabbath, namely after the Pasche, for then the eares of corne beganne to be ripe:
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:18834:171"/>
the fourth is mentioned, Iohn. 6. 4. when he fedde the fiue thousand: the 5. was the last
Pasche, wherein our Blessed Sauiour suffred: S. Paul also speaketh of the perfect age of
Christ at his resurrection, Ephes. 4. 13. which is at 35. yeares.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. That Christ was not 30. yeares complete, when he was baptized, is shewed
in the former question, and the words of the text are against it, that Christ was then begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to be 30. yeare old. 2. that Christ suffred after the 18. yeare of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> which will
followe if Christ died in his 35. yeare, is against the common receiued opinion, which assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the 18. yeare for Christs passion: which is gathered by the account of the Olympiads,
for Christ is held to haue beene borne in the 4. yeare of the 194. Olympiad, and to ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

suffred in the 4. yeare of the 202. Olympiad; the distance of yeares is iust 33. and no more.
3. That Pasche which Iohn speaketh of, cap. 5. 1. is like to be the same mentioned, Math.
12. 1. and Luk. 6. 1. as <hi>Pererius</hi> well obserueth, when after the Pasche the Apostles pulled
the eares of corne; which may be the reason, why Iohn passeth ouer in silence all that was
done betweene the second and third Pasche, which immediately he speaketh of c. 6. 4. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the the other Euangelists doe set forth at large what happened betweene the second
and third Pasche, <hi>Matth. c.</hi> 12. toc. 13. <hi>Marke,</hi> from the second to the 6. <hi>Luke,</hi> from the
6. to the 9. If fiue Passeouers could haue beene assigned out of the same Euangelist, then
he said somewhat: But out of diuerse Euangelists, who doe not followe the same order of
time, the number cannot so certainely be gathered. 4. that is but a weake reason taken from
the fulnesse and perfection of Christs age: <hi>Augustine</hi> by the same reason thinketh that we
shall rise againe about the age of thirtie, because Christ died in that age, <hi>lib. 22. de ciuitat.

either of the bodie or mind: as Ioseph at that age stood before Pharaoh, and Dauid at
that age beganne to raigne.</p>
                        <p>5. Some thinke that Christ died in the 34. yeare of his age, not complete, but onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne
some 3. moneths and certaine dayes, so <hi>Beda lib. de ration. tempor.</hi> c. 45. <hi>Albertus
Magnus in commentar. epistol. Dyonis. Onuphrius in Chronicis. Beda</hi> his reason is, because
he thinketh Christ to haue beene baptized, when he beganne to be 31. yeare old, and from,
thence preached 3. yeares and an halfe: But this opinion is contrarie to the text, which saith
he beganne to be 30. not 31. yeare old: and by this meanes Christs death is cast into the
19. yeare of <hi>Tiberius</hi> (which also <hi>Onuphrius</hi> thinketh) contrarie to the receiued opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
that Christ was borne in the 42. yeare of <hi>Augustus,</hi> and died in the 18. yeare of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>6. An other opinion yet is, that Christ was baptised in the beginning of his 30. yeare,
but beganne not to preach vntill the beginning of his 31. yeare, when he wrought that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
by changing water into wine, which is thought to haue beene done the same day
twelue-moneth after he was baptized: and yet the time of his preaching was 3. yeares and
an halfe: so <hi>Pererius lib. 11. in Daniel. quest. 7. opinion.</hi> 4. But 1. it is not like, that Christ
beeing baptised, and then publikely called by his fathers voice from heauen to be a teacher
of men, and therefore they are charged from heauen to heare him, would so long deferre the
execution of his holy function. 2. <hi>Pererius</hi> in this assertion is contrarie to himselfe: for if
Christ died as he prooueth at large in the 33. yeare of his age, and preached three yeares
and an halfe, then could not his preaching be deferred vnto the beginning of his 31. yeare,
for 3. yeares and an halfe counted from thence will fall into his 34. yeare: But concerning
the time, when Christ began to teach, more shall be said, when we come to speake of confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
the couenant, v. 27.</p>
                        <p>7. <hi>M. Lydyat</hi> thinketh that Christ died in the 33. yeare of his age almost complete, pag.
176. But then it would followe, that he was borne about the same season of the yeare,
wherein he suffred, about the vernall equinoctiall, or spring time, which opinion is refused
as improbable, quest. 71. following.</p>
                        <p>8. Wherefore the best resolution is this, that Christ died in the 33. yeare of his age
not complete, but about the middest thereof, not after 3. moneths, as <hi>Pererius,</hi> but
6. moneths after his 32. yeare complete. The first part of this assertion that Christ suffred
in his 33. yeare is thus prooued. 1. because by the Romane Chronologie, he is held to haue
beene borne in the 42. of <hi>Augustus</hi> inch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Tiberius:</hi> the distance of yeares is iust 33. for <hi>Augustus</hi> raigned 56. and then <hi>Tiberius</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.
2. the same is prooued by the Olympiads, as is before shewed, Christ was borne in
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:18834:172"/>
the 4. yeare of the 194. Olympiad, and died in the 4. yeare of the 202. Olympiad. 3. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rerius</hi>
further prooueth that Christ died in the 33. yeare of his age, by this astronomicall
calculation: It is agreed vpon that Christ suffered vpon the 15. day of the moneth, hauing
eaten the Passeouer vpon the 14. day at euen according to the lawe, the next euening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
Againe Christ died vpon the Iewish Sabbath eue, which is our Friday, for otherwise
he had not risen againe vpon the Lords day, which was the third day after: But in none of
the yeares of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

tuesday likewise: in the 34. on the 23. of March on wedensday: in the 35. on the 11.
day of Aprill on monday: But in the 33. yeare onely within this compasse (for of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yeares before the 30. or after the 35. there is no question) the 15. day of the moone
concurred with the 3. of Aprill vpon friday, as may be gathered counting the yeare of the
Lord by the Dominicall letter: therefore Christ onely suffered in the 33. yeare of his age.</p>
                        <p>4. After Christ was baptized, and beganne to preach, there were onely fowre Pasches,
which he kept, in the last whereof he died: as may be gathered out of the Gospel of S. Iohn:
the first Pasche is mentioned, cap. 2. 13. the second c. 5. 1. the third Iohn. 6. 4. and the last
when he suffred: to the which belong the 11. 13. and 18. chapters of S. Iohns Gospel: these
4. Pasches were kept in three yeares, and odde moneths, which were between the baptisme
of Christ and the first Pasche: But about the number of these Pasches there is some doubt,
as now shall be further shewed in the next question following.</p>
                        <p>The other part of the assertion, that there must be 6. moneths betweene the season or
time of the baptisme of Christ and of his blessed passion, is thus prooued: because Daniel
ending the 70. weekes in the death of Christ precisely, speaketh of halfe a weeke set apart
for the confirming of the couenant, which beganne at Christs baptisme, and causing all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sacrifices to cease: we must then haue halfe a seuen of yeares exactly from the baptisme
of Christ vnto the time of his passion.</p>

                           </gap> the explanation of that place: But this cannot be: 1. after that Pasche
Iohn 2. our Sauiour stayed a while in the citie: then he left the citie and Iudaea, and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
into Iudaea againe, and staied there a good while, Iohn 3. 23. after that he departed out
of Iudaea, and went by Samaria to goe into Galile, at what time there were yet 4. moneths
to haruest, Iohn. 4. 35. All these things could not be done in the space of fifty dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene

                              </gap>,</hi> which answereth vnto our March: wherefore this could not be the feast of
Pentecost, which is not two moneths from the Pasche. 3. when a feast of the Iewes is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
simply without any addition, it is vsually taken for the feast of the Passeouer, which
was their chiefe and principall feast, as is euident, Matth. c. 26. Luk. 22. Iohn. 13. 2. An
other opinion is, that this was one of the winter feasts, which were three, one of the dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the Temple, instituted by <hi>Iudas Macchabeus, lib. 1. Macchab. c.</hi> 4. which was
kept the 25. day of the 9. moneth <hi>Cisleu:</hi> the second was the feast of the reedifying of the
second Temple vnder <hi>Zerobabel,</hi> which was vpon the 3. day of the last moneth <hi>Adar,</hi>
whereof see Ezra. 6. 15. the third was the feast of lottes ordained by <hi>Mordecai</hi> and <hi>Esther,</hi>
vpon the 14. and 15. of the same moneth <hi>Adar,</hi> as is declared Esther. 9. some one of
these three feasts, some thinke this to haue beene: so <hi>Caietan in 5. c. Ioan. Melchior Canus
lib. 11. de loc. Theolog.</hi> But this is not like: for these were none of the principall feasts which
were instituted by Moses at the Lords appointment: But this was a principall feast of the
Iewes, because it is simply called a feast without any other addition, as is shewed before. 3.
Wherefore vpon the former reasons, this was likely to be the feast of the Passeouer, after
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:18834:172"/>
the which in the next moneth immediatly followeth haruest: and in the former chapter it is
said, there were 4. moneths then to haruest, c. 4. 35. And although in the next chapter fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
c. 6. 4. mention is made of the Pasch, that letteth not, but that this may be the Pasch
also: for it is vsuall with the Euangelists to ioyne things together which were done farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder,
omitting many things comming betweene: as <hi>Matthew</hi> immediatly after the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
and 40. daies fast of our blessed Sauiour, treateth of the calling of the Apostles, which
was done a good while after: So Iohn here omitteth those things which were done by our
Sauiour betweene the 2. and 3. Pasch, especially because they are handled at large by the
other Euangelists, Matth. c. 12. to 14. Mark. 2. to the 6. Luk. 6. to the 9.</p>
                        <p>2. As some would thus abridge the number of the feasts, and bring them to three: so
some others would enlarge the number of them: as they which thinke that there passed a
yeare betweene the baptisme of Christ, and the first miracle which he did in Cana of Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le:
so that they thinke one of the Passeouers, which followed next after the baptisme of
Christ, to be passed ouer in silence: to this opinion inclineth <hi>Pererius,</hi> and holdeth it to be
an auncient receiued tradition. But this is confuted before, qu. 69. <hi>artic.</hi> 6.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Ios. Scal.</hi> also thinketh that there were fiue Passeouers between the baptisme of Christ,
&amp; his passion, making that mentioned, Matth. 12. 1. &amp; Luk. 6. 1. to be the 3. Passeouer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beside
those other 4. mentioned by the Euangelist S. Iohn: as is noted before, quest. 69. opinion the
4. But what small ground there is of this assertion, there it is likewise shewed.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore this remaineth as the best resolution, that because Christ onely kept 4. Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouers,
neither more nor lesse after his baptisme, (as <hi>M. Lydyat</hi> well collecteth pag. 177.)
that he liued onely 3. yeares and so much as was from his baptisme to his first Passeouer, and
so was put to death in the 33. yeare of his age: Now for the further manifestation hereof,
before we proceede, it shall not be amisse breifely to touch the verie time of the yeare when
Christ was borne, and the verie day of his passion.</p>

                        <p>1. <hi>Epiphaenius</hi> opinion was, that Christ was borne vpon the 6. day of Ianuarie,<note place="margin">haeres. 51.</note> vpon which
day he thinketh he wrought his first miracle in Cana of Galile, and before that 60. daies he
was baptized: whereof he maketh this demonstration: after his baptisme he fasted 40. daies,
then he went to Nazareth, and there staied 15. daies: then one day which was the 56. he
staied with Iohn, who beeing absent, gaue that singular testimony of Christ: and the 57. Iohn
beeing present called Christ the lambe of God, that tooke away the sinnes of the world: the
58. day Andrew followed Christ, and the 59. Christ called vnto him Philip: and the 60. day
was there a marriage in Cana of Galile, as vpon which day Christ was borne. But here diuers
things are vncertenly alleadged, as of Iesus staying in Nazareth 15. daies: and some of those
things, which <hi>Epiphanius</hi> thinketh to haue beene vttered by Iohn of our Sauiour after his
baptisme, Ioh. 1. were spoken before, as v. 26. <hi>there is one among you, &amp;c. whose shooes latchet
I am not worthie to vnloose:</hi> these words were vttered by Iohn-before the baptisme of our
blessed Sauiour, Matth. 3. 11. And seeing the Euangelist calleth it the 3. day, wherein that
miracle was done in Cana, c. 2. 1. how can he make it the 60. day, and the next day, after
Christ had that conference with Philip; wheras it seemeth to be called the 3. day fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>M. Lydyat</hi> agreeth with their opinion, whom <hi>Clemens Alexander.</hi> mentioneth, who

he alleadgeth <hi>Keplerus</hi> who leaueth it vncertaine, whether Christ were borne the 6. of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuarie,</hi>
or the 19. of Aprill or May. <hi>M. Lydyats</hi> coniecture is, because the sheepheards are
said to haue watched their sheep by night, which more agreeth with the spring time, when
the lambes were young, and the rauenous beasts haue then their young also, and so are
more greedie and desirous of their pray, p. 157. <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. But seeing there must be halfe a
yeare betweene the season wherein Christ was baptized, &amp; wherein he suffered, because he
preached 3. yeares &amp; an halfe after his baptisme, which was in the beginning of his 30. yeare,
as S. Luke saith, c. 3. 23. then will his passion fall out in the middle, not in the ende of his last
yeare, and the time of his birth must be halfe a yeare before, qu. 68. 2. The shepheards
might watch their flockes as well at other times of the yeare, when they kept their sheepe
abroad, as in the spring, because that countrey was full of wolues: the reason is giuen of their
watching, because of their flocke, Luk. 2. 8. not of their young onely.</p>
                        <p>3. The common and receiued opinion is, that our blessed Sauiour was borne about the
25. of December, and baptized 13. daies after that season, in the beginning of his 30. yeare,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:18834:173"/>
about the 6. of Ianuarie. But beside these coniectures, 1. that is not like that in the deepe
of winter, the edict should come forth from <hi>Augustus</hi> to haue men called together to me
chiefe citie of their tribe to be taxed: as <hi>Ioseph</hi> and <hi>Marie</hi> came to Bethlehem to be taxed,
Luk. 2. 6. 2. or that in the cold time of winter the people went into the waters of Iordan
to be baptized of Iohn. 3. beside these coniectures, this is an euident argument, that Christs
birth was not so neare the Passeouer, because by Daniels prophesie here, there must be halfe
a Propheticall weeke from the time of confirming the couenant, by the preaching of the
Gospel, which was immediatly vpon the baptisme of Christ, who was then entring into his
30. yeare, Luk. 3. 23. from the baptisme then of Christ, about which season he was borne,
we must count. 3. yeares 6. moneths to the time of his passion.</p>

                              </gap>aldus</hi> thinketh, that Christ was borne about the 14. or 15. of
September, because 6. moneths after he suffered vpon the 15. of the first moneth. Beside he
taketh an other argument from the custome of the Grecians and Egyptians, who in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of Christs birth beganne their yeare in September, and the Imperiall indictions beganne
then also: and this third reason he vrgeth; there were 24. courses of the Priests, 1. Chron. 24.
who serued euery moneth by couples: Abiahs course, of the which Zacharie was, was the
8. single course, 1. Chron. 24. 10. and the 4. double: these courses beganne in March: then
Abiahs course fell out to be in Iune, the 4. moneth: immediatly after was Iohn Baptist con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
and 6. moneths after our blessed Sauiour, as may be gathered, Luk. 1. 26. 36. Iohn
beeing then conceiued in Iune, must be borne 9. moneths after in March: And our blessed
Sauiour must be conceiued in December, and his birth will fall out in the ninth moneth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
namely September: this reason also is pressed by <hi>Ioseph. Scalig.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>M. Lively</hi> in his <hi>Persian Monarchie</hi> from p. 144. to p. 151. doth make this answer to
<hi>Beroaldus</hi> reasons. 1. he answereth to the first reason taken from that place in Luk. 1. that
Christs age can not be gathered out of that place, because it is said, <hi>he was about, or as it were
30. yeares old,</hi> which word importeth a doubtfull and imperfect number. 2. that place of
Daniel is by some referred not to Christs preaching, but to the destruction of Ierusalem.
3. neither is it certen that Christ preached iust 3. yeares and an halfe: <hi>Ioseph. Scaliger</hi> maketh
the time of his preaching foure yeares: some make it lesse, as is shewed before, qu. 69.</p>
                        <p>2. The Grecians and Egyptians beganne their yeare in September, in remembrance of
Alexanders victorie against <hi>Darius:</hi> and the Imperiall indictions began then, because <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>
at that time began his raigne.</p>
                        <p>3. In the third reason many things are vncerten. 1. whether the Priests courses began in
March. 2. whether they serued by weekes or moneths. 3. in the Iewes ancient chronicle, called
<hi>Seder olam,</hi> in the last chap. it is affirmed, that <hi>Iehoiaribs</hi> course, which was the first, after the
destruction of the first &amp; second Temple, fell out in the 5. moneth <hi>Ab,</hi> which is in some part
answerable to our Iuly. <hi>M. Lydyat</hi> also here answereth, that the courses of the Priests were
changed after the captiuitie, p. 157. <hi>Ans.</hi> Though I am loath to contradict so generall &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
an opinion co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning Christs birth, neither wil I take vpon me to set down any thing
positiuely &amp; affirmatiuely therein: yet I will shew the vnsufficiencie of this answer, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
certaine doubts out of the Scripture, which I wil leaue to the Readers consideration.</p>
                        <p>The 2. argument alleadged by <hi>Beroaldus,</hi> taken from the Grecians beginning of their
yeare, and the Imperiall indictions, receiueth full satisfaction, and therefore I will not replie.
To the 3. argument also a reasonable answer is made, sauing that it is not to be doubted, but
that the moneth <hi>Nisau,</hi> answering in part to our March was the beginning of their yeare
for all Ecclesiasticall busines, as was appointed by Moses, Exod. 12. 1. and it is most like, that
the 24. courses went ouer euery yeare, and so two serued monethly: and notwithstanding
that testimonie out of the Iewish chronicle, the authoritie of the Scripture is more to be
waighed, which testifieth, that the orders of the Leuites were renued after their returne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the captiuitie in Nehemiahs time, <hi>according to the ordinance of Dauid the man of</hi>

                        <p>But the first reason taken from the age of Christ, when he was baptized, is not in mine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion

2. that this prophesie of Daniel of the 70. weekes determineth in Christs death, is shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before, quest. 49. neither can it haue any other meaning, without much wresting, as
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:18834:173"/>
either with <hi>Iunius</hi> to read, <hi>after 62. weekes, after the Messiah is slaine:</hi> whereas the words
are, <hi>after 62. weekes, the Messiah shall be slaine:</hi> or with M. <hi>Lively,</hi> to say that Messiah in this
prophesie is not to be taken for Christ: both which may seeme in any mans iudgement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to
be hard constructions of the text. 3. If this place then be vnderstood of the Messiah, there
must of necessitie be halfe a weeke allowed for his preaching: and it is the generall receiued
opinion of old and new, that Christ preached 3. yeares and a halfe: and it is more inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to denie that, then that Christ was borne in December.</p>
                        <p>Now then, though for mine owne part, in a matter indifferent and probable, I am loath
to goe against antiquitie; yet this first reason I must confesse, grounded vpon the authoritie
of Daniel for the space of 3. yeares and an halfe from Christs beginning to preach vnto his
death, and of S. Luke for Christs entring into 30. yeares when he was baptized, hath so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed
with me, that I thinke it very probable, that Christs birth was nearer September, then
December: And howsoeuer it is, there must needes be some error in the account of time, in
keeping Christs natiuitie day the 25. of December, seeing in the reuolution of 16. hundred
yeares, there may well be lost so many daies of the iust reckoning: from hence now may be
gathered the true distance betweene the baptisme and the passion of Christ, which shall be
distinctly handled in the next question.</p>

Christs baptisme and his passion.</head>
                        <p>1. <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> whose opinion was seene in the beginning of the former question, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the baptisme of Christ 60. daies before that season of the yeare wherein he was borne:
the day of Christs birth he thinketh to haue beene borne the 6. of Ianuarie: and 60. daies before
that falleth out in the beginning of November. But herein is <hi>Epiphanius</hi> error, he placeth
Christs baptisme toward the ende of the yeare, whereas it was in the beginning of Christs
30. yeare: and againe, he setteth Christs baptisme in this account but 4. moneths distant
from his passion.</p>
                        <p>2. Some bring the baptisme of Christ nearer vnto the Passeouer by 73. daies then Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius:
as they hold Christ to haue beene vpon the 25. of December, and then his
baptisme to haue beene solemnized about 13. daies after the season of his birth, about the
sixt of Ianuarie, in the beginning of Christs 30. yeare: so <hi>Pererius,</hi> as before is shewed, qu.
68. And to this purpose he alleadgeth <hi>Maximus, hom. 1. de Epiphan. ferunt Christum hodie,
vel stella duce à gentibus adoratum, &amp;c. they say that Christ this day (namely the Epiphanie)
was either adored of the Gentiles by the leading of a starre, or beeing inuited to the marriage,
to haue turned water into wine, or to haue receiued Iohns baptisme, and to haue consecrate the
flood of Iordan, &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>August. serm. 27. de tempor.</hi> maketh mention of these 3. opinions,
that some held the wise men to haue come vpon that day to worship Christ, some that he
turned water into wine, some that he was vpon that day baptised, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>But 1. these Fathers speake hereof vncertenly, not determining any thing, as <hi>Maximus</hi>
in the former place concludeth, <hi>quid potissimum praesenti hac factum sit die, noverit ipse qui
fecit,</hi> but what was chiefly done vpon this day, he knoweth that did it: so then this traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
had no certen ground. 2. <hi>Pererius</hi> himselfe thinketh with others, that the halfe weeke
which Daniel speaketh of, wherein the Messiah should cause the sacrifices to cease, beganne
at Christs baptisme: then must there be iust 6. moneths from the time of Christs baptisme
vnto the Passeouer, for how els shall the halfe yeare be made vp?</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Iosephus Scaliger, lib. 6. de emendat. tempor.</hi> bringeth Christs baptisme yet nearer vnto
the Passeouer: for he thinketh that the miracle of conuerting the water into wine, was done
3. daies after Christs baptisme: the 1. day after, Andrew and Peter followed Christ, the 2.
day Philip was called, and Nathaniel, Ioh. 1. then the 3. day after was the mariage in Cana
of Galile, Ioh. 2. 1. and then it is saide, v. 13. that the Iewes Passeouer was at hand. But this
opinion can not hold. 1. Christ after he was baptised, presently was tempted in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse,
as <hi>S.</hi> Marke saith, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>immediatly the spirit driueth him into the wildernesse,</hi> Mark.
1. 12. And S. Luke thus writeth, c. 4. 1. <hi>Iesus beeing full of the holy Ghost returned fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Iordan,
and was led by the spirit into the wildernes:</hi> the first thing then, that fell out after Christs bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
was his te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptation, which continued 40. daies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how then could that miracle be 3. daies
after Christs baptisme. 2. Therfore it is to be vnderstood, that it was the 3. day either after he
came into Galile, or rather the 3. day after he had that conference with <hi>Philip</hi> &amp; <hi>Nathaniel.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. Wherefore the best resolution is, that Christ was baptized about the beginning of
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:18834:174"/>
September, when he beganne to be 30. yeare old, and the reason hereof is grounded vpon
Daniels halfe weeke: for whether we beginne the 70. and last weeke from the baptisme of
Christ, or the latter halfe weeke (for there are of both opinions, as is shewed before, but the
latter is more probable) we must, to make vp this halfe weeke haue 6. moneths from the
season, wherein Christ was baptized, to the time of the Passeouer.</p>

                        <head>73. Quest. Vpon what day of the weeke Christ suffered, and whether
vpon a festiuall day.</head>
                        <p>To know vpon what day of the weeke Christ suffered, we must finde out when he did
eate his Passeouer. 1. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> thinketh that he did eate it vpon the third day of the
weeke at euen, when the fourth day begunne with the Iewes, who reckon their ciuill day
from the euening. But this can not be: for then if Christ are his Passeouer either vpon the 3.
or 4. day, he must haue suffered the 5. which was the day following, and then he must haue
risen againe iust vpon the Iewes Sabbath, not on the morrow after the Sabbath, as the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie
of the Gospel sheweth. 2. <hi>Ios. Scaliger</hi> thinketh that Christ did eate the Passeouer
in the eue of the 6. day, and the day following, which was part of the 6. day, he suffered. But
this cannot be: for the Passeouer was to be killed vpon the 14. day of the Moone betweene
the two euenings: which was, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> well obserueth out of <hi>Iosephus,</hi> from the time of
the euening sacrifice, which was about the ninth houre, to the going downe of the Sunne,
which was the space of 3. houres: but the 15. day beganne not till after Sunne-set: therefore
that space betweene the two euenings, was the ende of the 14. day, which was at this time,
the fift day of the weeke, not the beginning of the 15. day, which was the sixt of the weeke.</p>
                        <p>Now further <hi>Iosephus Scaliger</hi> holdeth, that Christ and the Iewes did eate their Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
both at the same instant vpon the 14. day at euen according to the law: and that the
next day he suffered, which was the first day of vnleauened bread. And for the better main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of this assertion, he presseth these arguments: 1. Otherwise the Iewes should haue
aduantage against vs, who obiect, that Christ suffered not vpon any festiuall day, wherein
they kept the Passeouer, and so the type and the substance agreed not together. 2. the
Grecians to vphold their opinion, that the Eucharist must be ministred with leauened
bread, because Christ gaue vnto his disciples leauened bread, do also affirme, that Christ did
eate the Passeouer one day sooner, then the Iewes did eate it. 3. he vrgeth that place of S.
Mark. 14. 12. <hi>the first day of vnleauened bread, when they sacrificed the Passeouer, his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
said vnto him:</hi> hence he inferreth, that at the same time, the Passeouer was generally
eaten, when Christ also did eate it.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi>Ans.</hi> In this question <hi>Bellarmine</hi> with other Romanists, concurre with <hi>Ios. Scalig.</hi> but
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> is answered els where,<note place="margin">Synops. contr. 13. qu. 4.</note> and therefore I will onely examine <hi>Scaligers</hi> arguments.</p>
                        <p>1. If the Iewes vpon a blind tradition deferred the Pasch to auoid the concurrence of two
Sabbaths, which should haue bin this yeare, wherein Christ suffered, if the first solemne day
of the Pasch had bin kept according to the law vpon the 15. day, for their ordinarie Sabbath
followed the next: &amp; yet Christ kept it, as the law prescribed; &amp; so suffered that day wherein
the Pasch should haue bin solemnized: the typical lamb &amp; the true lambe (this notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding)
agreed together, because Christ was sacrificed at that time, when the first day of the
Passeouer should haue bin kept by the law, though the Iewes by a corrupt custome &amp; vsage
kept it not. 2. The Grecians may ground an error vpon a true position: it followeth not,
because Christ preuented the common eating of the Passeouer, that therefore he eate the
Passeouer with leauened bread, for that had bin against the law, Exod. 12. 8. for although
leauened bread were not yet put out of the Iewes houses, yet Christ sending his disciples
before, might prouide vnleauened bread for his paschal supper: and as the Grecians hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ground their opinion, that the Eucharist is onely to be ministred with leauened bread: so
the Romanists on the otherside doe as stiffely maintaine their superstition, that vnleauened
bread onely must be vsed, holding that Christ at the same time did eate the Passeouer with
the rest of the Iewes. 3. <hi>S. Marke</hi> respecteth the right time appointed by the law for the
Passeouer, not the corrupt vsage which the Iewes had taken vp: so then that day was the
first of vnleauened bread at euen by right of the institution, though it were not so in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
among the Iewes: and therefore <hi>S. Luke</hi>
                           <note n="a" place="margin">chap. 22. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>.</note> saith, <hi>then came the day of vnleauened bread,
wherein the Passeouer ought to be sacrificed.</hi> But now the contrarie is euident out of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
that the Iewes receiued not the Passeouer generally vntill the eue after Christ was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified.
1. It is said,<note n="b" place="margin">Ioh. 18. 28.</note> 
                           <hi>they themselues came not into the common hall, least they should be defiled,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:18834:174"/>
but that they might eate the Passeouer:</hi> They did not then eate the Passeouer till the euening
after Christs passion. <hi>Iosephus Scaliger</hi> answereth, that the sacrifices which were offered in
the feast of the Passeouer, were called the Passeouer, as well as the Paschal lambe: alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that place, Deut. 16. 2. <hi>Thou shalt offer the Passeouer to the Lord thy God, of sheepe, and
bullocks, &amp;c.</hi> But here the phrase is to sacrifice the Passeouer, which was as well referred to
the offering of the other sacrifices, as the paschal lambe. <hi>Contr.</hi> Yet to eate the Passeouer is
not otherwise vsed in the Gospel, then of the eating of the Paschal lambe.</p>
                        <p>2. If the Iewes had eaten the Paschal lambe the same night with Christ, then the next
day should haue beene a solemne festiuall day, wherein they should haue done no seruile
worke, as is appointed Exod. 12. 16. But they did much seruile worke vpon this day, as in
carrying the crosse, pitching of it into the ground, raising of it vp, nayling Christ vnto it:
And indeede they themselues also resolued not to put Christ to death vpon the feast day,
Mark. 14. 2. <hi>Ioseph. Scaliger</hi> here answereth, that the day wherein Christ suffered was the
first day of vnleauened bread, but not of the paschal solemnitie: But this distinction is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
to the place before alleadged out of Exodus, where the 15. day, which was the first of
vnleauened bread, as likewise the seauenth and last, are named to be daies of solemne as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies
wherein no seruile worke should be done, sauing about that which they did eate.</p>
                        <p>3. The day wherein Christ suffered is called the preparation of the Passeouer, Ioh. 19.
14. it was not then the day of the Passeouer it selfe. <hi>Ioseph. Scaliger</hi> answereth, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
was not the whole day, but onely after the ninth houre: as he alleadgeth out of
a certaine Edict of <hi>Augustus.</hi> But 1. it appeareth, that the preparation was the whole day,
at the least from the sixt houre: as in the same place the Euangelist saith, it was the preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Passeouer, and about the sixt houre. 2. If then it were the preparation of the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer,
then was not that day the first of the Passeouer.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Paulus Burgens.</hi> somewhat to helpe out this tradition of the Iewes his countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who deferred the Pasch, if it fell out vpon the 6. day of the weeke, to auoid the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of two festiuall daies, saith there was a double account of the 14. day of the Moone,
<hi>vna vera &amp; legitima secundum veram computationem Christi, &amp;c.</hi> one was the true and
lawfull day according to the true computation of Christ, who knew all the mysteries of the
law: the other was <hi>legitima secundum communem &amp; assuetam computationem aliorum,</hi> law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
also according to the common and accustomed computation of others, &amp;c. M. <hi>Lydyat</hi>
also sheweth that the difference betweene the obseruation of the Pasch betweene our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Sauiour, and the Iewes, did arise hereupon; because Christ reckoned the daies according
to the computation of the naturall years, but the Iewes followed the <hi>Syro-Grecian</hi> account,
found out by <hi>Callippus,</hi> beginning the moneths, not as the Hebrewes, at the new Moone,
but as the Grecians beganne their moneths: so that the Iewes began their moneth <hi>Nisan,</hi> as
the Grecians did their moneth <hi>Xanthicus,</hi> which that yere beganne one day after the new
Moone. <hi>Lyd. de emend. temp. p.</hi> 179. Both these might very well concurre together, that the
Iewes did keepe another day of the Passeouer, then Christ and his disciples, both vpon a
blind tradition, to auoide the concurrence of two Sabbaths, and because they followed a
strange computation. But it is euident hereby, that they did not eate the Passeouer the same
day with Christ, and that they did breake the law of Moses in receiuing a forren computati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their moneths, which was not lawfull, howsoeuer <hi>Burgensis,</hi> in fauour of his countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
excuse it by the vsuall custome.</p>

of these interpretations there are diuerse kinds.</p>
                        <p>Of the first. 1. Some read thus, <hi>he shall destroy the citie with the captaine to come, Sept.</hi> but
the word (<hi>with</hi>) is not in the originall. 2. <hi>Iunius</hi> thus interpreteth, he, that is, the Messiah, the
Prince, shall destroy <hi>the people of the Prince,</hi> his owne people, <hi>which shall come,</hi> that is, which
shall be then. So also <hi>M. Br. he shall destroy the people of the Prince, in the next generation.</hi> But
1. it should seeme not to be so proper a speach, he, that is (the Messiah the Prince) should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
the people of the Prince, that is, his owne people: 2. and in the original there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction
to couple them together: the words standing thus; <hi>and the citie and the Sanctuarie
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:18834:175"/>
shall destroy the people, &amp;c.</hi> but in this sense a coniunction must be supplied, <hi>and the people,
&amp;c.</hi> 3. and though the word <hi>nagid,</hi> prince, were before ioyned with Messiah, yet here
beeing put alone, it is not necessarie so to vnderstand it of the Messiah. 4. neither were the
Iewes then the people of the Messiah, whom they had reiected and crucified.</p>
                        <p>2. Of the second sort are these interpretations. 1. <hi>Polanus</hi> giueth this sense: <hi>the people
of the Prince to come,</hi> that is, the Gentiles, who should become the people of Christ beeing
conuerted to the Gospell, shall destroy the citie: But the Romanes were not at that time,
when they sacked Ierusalem, conuerted to the faith of Christ, and so not his people.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>M. Liuely</hi> by this word <hi>to come,</hi> vnderstandeth the strangers and commers which are
opposite to inhabitants, as the word is vsed, Gen. 42. 5. <hi>the sonnes of Iacob came to buy food
among those that came:</hi> so his meaning is, that the citie and Sanctuarie should be surprised
by strangers and commers: but the word <hi>haba,</hi> to come, seemeth rather to be referred vnto
the time following, then to the condition of the people: though it be true, that Ierusalem
was spoiled by forreners and strangers.</p>
                        <p>3. Some reade, <hi>the principall people of the Prince or captaine to come, Vatab.</hi> and he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the destruction of the citie to be imputed vnto the people rather then their captaine,
because <hi>Titus</hi> would haue defended the Sanctuarie, from the spoile of the souldiers: but
the word is <hi>nagid,</hi> which signifieth a <hi>Prince,</hi> not <hi>principall,</hi> and the other obseruation seemeth
to be somewhat too neere and curious.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> by this captaine vnderstandeth <hi>Pompey</hi> the great, who tooke Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
and slew 12000. Iewes, and afterward Crassus robbed the Temple, and then Herod
and Sosius made hauocke of the citie: But this captaine with his people, were to come after
the Messiah was slaine, which was spoken of immediately before.</p>
                        <p>5. Wherefore by the Prince and people to come, are signified <hi>Vespasian</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> his
sonne, with the Romane armie, which should besiege the citie, and destroy both it and the
Temple, as <hi>Bulling. Calv. Osiander</hi> doe well vnderstand it: so also <hi>Lyranus:</hi> and this is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to that prediction of our Blessed Sauiour, Luk. 19. 43. <hi>The dayes shall come vpon thee,

should be fulfilled, Matth. 24. 34. <hi>This generation shall not passe, till all these things be done:</hi>
but the destruction by <hi>Adrianus</hi> was well nigh an 100. yeares after Christ spake those

<hi>Herodians,</hi> whose whole time from the beginning
of the raigne of <hi>Herod</hi> the great, to the ende of
their gouernment at the destruction of Ierusalem,
was 103. yeares: which is summed thus: <hi>Herod</hi> the

the sonne of <hi>Agrippa 26. Oecolampad.</hi> Now of this account 63. yeares must be cut off for
the raigne of <hi>Herod,</hi> in whose 30. complete, and 31. begunne, Christ was borne, as is shewed

                        <head>76. Quest. Why mention is made of the destruction of Ierusalem here,
seeing it is without the compasse of the

                        <p>1. One reason hereof is, because Daniel was desirous to vnderstand what should befall
his citie in time to come, the Angel doth satisfie his full desire, and as he had told him of the
reedifying of the Temple and citie, so he also foretelleth of the finall ende and dissolution of
both.</p>
                        <p>2. An other cause is, that after the Angel had shewed him that the Messiah should be
slaine, then further, that it might appeare, what an hainous sinne this was, the destruction of
the citie is sore shewed to follow, as a iust punishment for so great a wickednes: <hi>Perer.</hi> so also
<hi>Lyranus: quia hoc factum fuit in poenam mortis Christi,</hi> because this was done for a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

                        </p>
                        <p>3. A third reason, why mention is here made of this desolation is, to make the Iewes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excusable:
that seeing they haue found all this to be true by their wofull experience here
foreshewed by the Angel, that their citie is destroied vnto this day because of their treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
against the Messiah, their obstinate blindnes therein might appeare, that yet continue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies

vpon the citie: like as the ouerflowing of waters pulleth vp trees by the rootes, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth
the very foundations of houses; so in this desolation, the citie should be made e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
with the ground, and one stone should not be left vpon an other, as our Sauiour fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
them, Luk. 19. 44. <hi>Bullinger.</hi> 3. Further, like as in inundations and ouerflowings, the
waters still encrease, and swell more and more, so hereby is signified, that <hi>calamitates magis
&amp; magis increscebant,</hi> their calamities should more and more encrease: for still their
state waxed worse and worse: they were afflicted by <hi>Pompey,</hi> but more by <hi>Crassus;</hi> and he
was tolerable in respect of the gouernours which followed, <hi>Pontius Pilate, Albinus, Florus,</hi>
who still were more cruell one then another, <hi>Oecolampad.</hi> 4. And in that it is said, <hi>vnto the

resist and put the Romanes to much trouble and businesse, yet in the ende they should
preuaile, and make a finall desolation, <hi>Melancthon.</hi> 5. Thus the Scripture vseth by this si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
of invndations and ouerflowing of waters, to set forth the horrible wast and deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation

                           <hi>R. Salomon</hi> giueth this corrupt interpretation of this place, that in the ende of the last

the Iewes, as is euident by the ceasing of the sacrifices there mentioned. 2. It is but a
dreame, that their Messiah shall be a glorious temporall Prince, seeing the Angel here shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that Messiah shall be slaine by them. 3. by Gog and Magog are vnderstood the Scythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
and Sarmatians, and other people which ioyned with Antiochus against the Iewes,
which battell was before the destruction of Ierusalem aboue 240. yeares. And that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gog
signifieth the Scythians, this euidence there is, because the Scythians built a citie in Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,
which they called Magog, as witnesseth <hi>Plinie lib. 5. c. 23. Polan.</hi>

per Iudaeos,</hi> but afterward the pointing was changed by the Iewes, &amp;c. But <hi>Lyranus</hi> fayleth
diuersely in this his defence of the vulgar Latine. 1. there is great difference betweene
these two words, not in points onely, but in letters: the word vsed in that place of Ionas con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth

signifieth <hi>vntill,</hi> hath but two letters, with <hi>camets,</hi> and without <hi>cholem.</hi> 2. to imagine, that
the Iewes haue altered points, and changed words in Scripture, is verie dangerous: for so
should we haue no certaintie in Scripture: and beside, it is not like the Iewes would vse any
such fraud, seeing that they haue in account the number of all the letters in the old Test<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

yeares, as the Prophet Ieremie shewed them before: the heate of persecution vnder <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ochus,</hi>
how long it should lie vpon the Iewes, is likewise reuealed to Daniel by the Angel,
c. 8. But this last captiuitie and dispersion of the Iewes, they haue no notice at all, how
long it shall endure. 2. their other captiuities were nothing so long, their seruitude in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt

yeares. 3. In the other captiuities, they had prophets to comfort them, as Moses in Egypt,
in the Babylonian captiuitie Daniel and Ezekiel: but such Prophets they haue none now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them. 4. Then had they diuerse signes and miracles: as the 3. children were deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from the fierie fornace, Daniel from the Lyons, but now are miracles ceased among
them. 5. At other times they had excellent men, raised from among them, which were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
and honourable for their wisedome, and vertue, euen with the Princes of the heathen:
as Ioseph with the king of Egypt: Daniel with the kings of the Chaldeans, <hi>Ezra, Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,
Mordecai</hi> with the kings of Persia: But none such now are found among the Iewes.</p>
                        <p>2. Beside, the Iewes are now depriued of seuen seuerall benefits and priuiledges,<note place="margin">7. benefits which the Iewes haue beene depriued of since the captiuitie of Babylon.</note> which
they enioyed in their former times: 1. they haue not the Arke. 2. nor the Lords oracles
from thence. 3. they want the Vrim and Thummim, wherewith the Priests vsed to aske
counsell of God. 4. the fire which came downe from heauen, and was continually preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
vpon the altar, was long since extinguished among them. 5. the holy oyle, wherewith
the graces of the spirit were conferred vpon their kings and Priests, hath lost the vertue. 6.
the gift of prophecie is ceased among them. 7. neither doth the sixt yeare bring forth fruit
for three yeares, as at the first it vsed to doe. And if it be here answered, that the Iewes wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
all these things after their returne from Babel, while the second Temple yet stood; yet
now their case is much worse: because then they had both a Temple with Priests, and sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,

taken, it appeareth both by their miserable state wherein they were oppressed with famine,
the pestilence, and the sword among themselues, the great hauocke and slaughter made of
them by the enemie, and by their reproachfull and slauish condition afterward. 1. during
the siege, they were so oppressed with famine, that women were constrained to deuoure
their owne children, they did eat the verie leather of their shooes and targets: they died in
such heapes within the citie of the plague, famine, and by ciuill discord, that the streetes and
channels lay full of dead bodies, and were trampled vpon as mire in the streetes: in so much
that beeing wearie of burying them, they threwe their bodies from the wall into the tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches:
which when <hi>Titus</hi> beheld full of dead bodies, he stretched his hands to heauen, as te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying
his innocencie, that it was not his doing. 2. the number of the Iewes were great,
which were slaine by the enemies: in <hi>Caesarea</hi> there were slaine 20. thousand, in <hi>Scythopolis</hi>
13. thousand, in <hi>Prolemais</hi> 5000. in <hi>Alexandria</hi> 50. thousand, in <hi>Damascus</hi> 10. thousand:
this was somewhat before the beginning of that warre. Then afterward the warre bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
begunne, there were slaine in Galile 18. thousand, in <hi>Aphek</hi> 150000. in Samaria 11.
thousand and 600. in <hi>Iotapata</hi> 4000. in <hi>Taricha</hi> 6600. in <hi>Giscalis 2000. ex Oecolamp.</hi> the
whole summe of those which died in the siege by the famine, pestilence, and sword, came
to 11. hundred thousand, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> writeth, <hi>lib. 7. de bello Iudaic. c.</hi> 16. 17. 3. Neither
was here an ende of their miserie: They which remained, the better sort of them were reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
for tryumpht they which were aboue 17. yeare old were sent into Egypt, to be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in certaine workes, and some were cast vnto the wilde beasts: they which were vnder
17. yeares were sold to be slaues: the whole number of the captiues is noted by <hi>Iosephus</hi> to
haue beene 97. thousand.</p>

                        <head>Quest. 80. That all this miserie came vpon the Iewes for putting to

                        <p>1. The Iewes will by no meanes acknowledge that they haue and yet doe suffer these
things for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                           </gap>oue their patience, and that they thereby should be tried as gold in the fire.
But to this we answer, 1. that they by these afflictions are nothing amended, but waxe
worse, their impietie, profanenesse, blasphemie is notoriously knowne to all the world. 2.
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:18834:177"/>
though God lay temporall chastisements vpon men, to trie their patience: yet to that ende
none are depriued of spirituall blessings, as they are of the gift of prophesie, of miracles,
of the publike worship of God according to his lawe. 3. beside the Lord hath promised
them ample and great blessings, so long as they walke in obedience of his law, as is extant,
<hi>Leuit.</hi> 26. and <hi>Deuter.</hi> 28. so that they should make God a liar, if these things were not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen
them for their sinnes.</p>
                        <p>2. The Iewes haue an other answer, that they are not punished for the death of Christ,
but for their other sinnes. But the greatest sinnes for the which the Iewes were punished in
time past, were their Idolatrie, and killing of their Prophets: which sinnes they are not now
gultie of:<note place="margin">epistol. 129. ad Dardanum.</note> for they haue no Prophets to kill, and Idolaters they are not, as <hi>Hierome</hi> saith vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

thou doest not worship idols, though thou art in captiuitie vnder the Persians and Romans,
yet thou art ignorant of strange Gods, &amp;c. If then God had compassion vpon them, when
they went into captiuitie for those sinnes, certainly this long captiuitie is now fallen vpon
them for some greater sinne then any of the other: And what can that be els, then the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to death of the Blessed Messiah? And so <hi>Hierome</hi> concludeth, <hi>memento voci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

All this therefore is happened vpon them for killing the heire of the vineyard, whereas they

                        <p>3. Now as it is euident, that the Iewes are punished for the death and murther of the
Messiah; so as their offence was hainous, the punishment is also great, which is inflicted vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them: which is twofold, either corporall or spirituall, the corporall is threefold, in the
losse of their dignitie, they beeing depriued of their gouernement and policie, in the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
desolation of their citie, and their ignominious exile and dispersion thorough the
world: their spirituall punishment is twofold, the blinding of their minde, and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and the hardening of their heart, as the Prophet Isay saith, c. 6. 10. <hi>make the heart of

                        <p>1. <hi>Cyrillus Hierosol. cateches.</hi> 12. beginning the 69. weekes at <hi>Darius,</hi> and ending them
at the birth of Christ, omitteth the 70. weeke altogether. But that must needs be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
to haue beene a great ouersight in <hi>Cyril,</hi> seeing that the most speciall things to be
performed by the Messiah, was done in the 70. and last weeke.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Hyppolitus</hi> ending the 69. weekes in the natiuitie of Christ, deferreth the 70. and last
to the ende of the world, vnto the preaching of Henoch and Elias: But beside that it was
the errour of those times, that Henoch and Elias should come in their owne persons, and
preach toward the ende of the world: seeing our Sauiour expoundeth that prophesie (of the
comming of Elias) of Iohn Baptist<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Matth. 11. who came in the spirit of Elias: this last
weeke must not be seuered so farre from the 69. weekes: but as the 62. followed immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
the first 7. so after the 7. weekes and the 62. weekes, which make 69. must followe
the 70. and last weeke.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Eusebius,</hi> as <hi>Hierome</hi> reporteth his opinion in his commentarie vpon this place, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the 69. weekes at the baptisme of Christ, taketh the 70. and last weeke for 70. yeares,
and so extendeth it vnto the time of <hi>Traian</hi> the Emperour, for so long the preaching of the
Apostles continued, Iohn the Euangelist suruiuing all the Apostles vntill then. But seeing
<hi>Eusebius</hi> taketh the 69. propheticall weekes but for 7. yeares a peice, he hath no reason to
make the last weeke tenne times so much as any of the other; neither is a weeke of yeares in
any place so taken in Scripture.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> taketh this 70. and last weeke yet more largely, for he beginneth it at
<hi>Pompeys</hi> time when the state of the Iewish commonwealth beganne to decline, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth
it vnto the death of Christ, which he reckoneth to be some 98. yeares, and endeth
the week in the raigne of the Emperour <hi>Hadrian,</hi> which is aboue 98. yeares more, in which
time all these things happened here spoken of, and then was the finall desolation of the citie:
so he taketh the 70. and last weeke, not for any certaine number of yeares, but for the ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude
and fulnesse of time: But seeing the rest of the weekes doe signifie a certaine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:18834:177"/>
time, and they are onely taken for weekes of yeares: so must the 70. and last weeke be
vnderstood also: and considering that this last weeke is deuided into two halfe weekes, the
latter expressed, the other vnderstood, therein must be contained a definite and certaine
number: for the parts beeing finite and certaine, so must the whole be likewise.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi>Osiander</hi> taketh this last weeke to beginne after Christs resurrection, in which space
of seuen yeares many by the preaching of the Gospel were receiued and admitted to the
newe couenant: But seeing the Angel saith, that 70. weekes are determined, and cut out, <hi>to
finish wickednesse, and to seale vp sinnes,</hi> which things are performed in the death of Christ,
there also must the weekes ende.</p>
                        <p>6. Many beginne this last weeke at the baptisme of Christ, and ende it 3. yeares and an
halfe after, as <hi>Melancthon, Iunius edition. 1. Pintus,</hi> with others: But seeing it is said, he shall
confirme the couenant for one weeke, (he, that is the Messiah) the couenant must be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
before the Messiah be slaine: for otherwise how should it appeare that this couenant
was confirmed by the Messiah, if it be not done in his time, that is, in the dayes of his flesh:
he then must confirme it either before, or at his death: <hi>priusquam tollitur è medio,</hi> before he
be taken out of the way, <hi>Vatab.</hi> for otherwise it should not be conspicuous, and apparant to
be the Messiahs worke.</p>
                        <p>7. Some doe referre this last weeke vnto the last seuen yeares which went immediately
before the destruction of the citie, <hi>Iun. Polan. M. Liuely.</hi> But it is sufficiently shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that these 70. weekes must expire in the death of the Messiah, and are not to be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
so farre, see quest. 49.</p>
                        <p>8. The best interpretation then is this, that this last weeke must beginne 7. yeares before
the death of Christ: the first halfe yeare went before his baptisme, as a preparation thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:
then in the latter halfe weeke these things were performed, as the next words shewe,
<hi>H. Br. Concent.</hi> the whole week is named, because these things were done in the last week:
but not in all the weeke, onely in the latter halfe thereof, beginning at Christs baptisme. So
<hi>Hugo</hi> expoundeth it, <hi>quia non in principio hebdomadis hae mirabilia coeperunt, ideo determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat,
quando haec inchoata sunt, &amp;c.</hi> because these things were not done in the beginning of
the weeke, therefore he determineth when they should beginne, namely, in the latter halfe
weeke, which beganne in the 15. yeare of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> when Christ was baptised.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>2. Some referring this last weeke vnto the destruction of Ierusalem, by this couenant
doe vnderstand that speciall fauour, which the Lord shewed, and the fatherly care, which
he had of his Church in Ierusalem, who were admonished by a reuelation to depart the citie
before the siege beganne, so <hi>Iun. Polan.</hi> But here rather we are to vnderstand the euerlasting

said, we knowe thou art a teacher come from God, Iohn. 3. 8. yea of the deuils themselues,
who beeing cast out of men, cried out and confessed that he was Christ the Sonne of God.
2. The second kind of confirmation was by the prophecies of the old Testament concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Messiah, which were all fulfilled in Christ, as the historie of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> Gospell sheweth.
3. The third ratification was by Christs wonderfull and most glorious miracles. 4. by his
holy life and conuersation. 5. by the predictions of our Lord himselfe, which are noted to
be seuen. 1. of the ruine and destruction of the citie, Luk. 19. 43. 2. of the miracles which
should be wrought by his disciples, Mark. 14. 17. 3. of the great persecutions which his
disciples should suffer for his name, Iohn. 16. 2. 4. of the preaching of the Gospell tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough

16. 6. of the continuance of the same Church, as hauing a most sure foundation beeing
builded vpon the rocke, Matth. 16. 18. 7. of his owne death, his resurrection, Mat. 16. 21.
and the sending of the Holy Ghost, Act. 1. <hi>Perer.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>6. But <hi>Lyranus</hi> also mentioneth sixe wayes, whereby Christ confirmed this couenant,
<hi>praedicando, miracula faciendo, &amp;c.</hi> by preaching, doing of miracles, in dying, rising againe,
ascending, and sending the Holy Ghost.</p>
                        <p>7. But by two wayes chiefely was this couenant ratified and confirmed, by the declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and publishing thereof by his preaching, and by the sealing thereof by his most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
blood: like as a Testament, is first declared and written, and then confirmed by the
death of the Testator; So in the death of our Blessed Sauiour, was the couenant before set
forth by his preaching, fully established, as <hi>Oecolampad. Scimus, &amp;c. in morte ipsa proprie foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus
confirmari, &amp;c.</hi> we know, according to the author of the epistle to the Hebrewes, that
the couenant was properly confirmed in his death, &amp;c. And this further may be made plaine
thus. 1. by the type and figure: as Moses tooke the booke of the lawe, and reade in it, and
then sprinkled the blood vpon the people, saying, <hi>this is the blood of the couenant,</hi> Exod.
24. 8. so the booke of this couenant declared by Christs preaching was made sure in his
blood. 2. This also appeareth by the institution of the Lords supper, where Christ saith of
the cuppe representing his blood, <hi>this is the newe Testament in my blood, &amp;c.</hi> Luk. 22. 20.
that is, a signe, seale, and representation thereof. 3. the Apostle sheweth this also by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and condition of a Testament, which is confirmed when men are dead, Heb. 9. 17. and
so in this place the Septuagint translate the Hebrewe word <hi>berith,</hi> by the Greeke word

                        <p>1. <hi>Pererius</hi> deliuereth it as an auncient tradition, and a receiued opinion, that Christ

was imprisoned: but that can not be: for Iohn beganne to baptize before Christ came vnto
his baptisme: and before Christ was baptized, he preached not, neither shewed himselfe
publikely: therefore the beginning can not be vnderstood, to be from Iohns baptisme in
that sense. 2. Seeing Christ was publikely in his baptisme called from heauen to the office
of teaching, in that it is saide, <hi>Heare him,</hi> it is not like that our blessed Sauiour would inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
that holy function<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a yeare together. 3. Before that miracle in Cana of Galile, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
Disciples, as is euident, Ioh. 1. as Andrew and Peter, Philip and Nathaniel: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
euen then he beganne to be a publike teacher. 4. If Christs preaching beganne a yeare
after his baptisme, in the beginning of his 31. yeare, then could he not preach and confirme
the Couenant, halfe a weeke, that is, 3. yeares and a halfe, seeing he is generally held to haue

                        <p>1. <hi>R. Shelamo</hi> thus interpreteth the halfe weeke, that a little before the destruction of
Ierusalem, after the Iewes had violated the truce taken betweene them and the Romanes
for 7. yeares, then in the middes of the weeke, that is, in the fourth yeare of those seuen, the
Romanes came and besieged the citie. But it is shewed before, qu. 82. that this is but a Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binicall
conceit, that any such truce was made betweene the Romanes and the Iewes.</p>
                        <p>2. Some doe likewise refetre this halfe weeke to the destruction of Ierusalem, that in
the middes thereof, that is, the 5. yeare before the ouerthrow of the citie, the Romanes
came &amp; laid siege vnto it: <hi>Iun. Polan. M. Lively.</hi> But this sense can not be admitted, because
it hath beene prooued alreadie, qu. 49. that these 70. weekes, and euery part thereof, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
in the death of Christ.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Iosephus Scaligor</hi> hath a conceit by himselfe, that this 70. and last weeke must be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided:
the one part thereof he alloweth for the time of Christs preaching, namely 4. yeares
and an halfe, the other for the destruction of the citie, two yeares and an halfe more. But
here two exceptions may iustly be taken: 1. he diuideth this weeke, the one part aboue 30.
yeares from the other, whereas euery part of these weekes must one succeede an other. 2.
he diuideth two yeares and an halfe from the rest: but that maketh not halfe a weeke.</p>
                        <p>4. Some beginne this halfe weeke at the death of Christ, and continue it afterward,
when the sacrifices and rites of the law beganne to be abolished by the Apostles, as we read
Act. 15. <hi>Perer. Pint. Melancth. M. Lydyat</hi> in <hi>ann. 4043. Osiand.</hi> sauing that <hi>Osiander</hi> maketh
it the first halfe of the last weeke, the other the latter: But it hath beene prooued alreadie,
that these yeares must ende in Christs death.</p>
                        <p>5. This halfe weeke then is better taken for the latter halfe part of the weeke, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth

so also <hi>Hugo</hi> beginneth this halfe weeke in the 15. of Tiberius, at Christs baptisme: for
then in the baptisme of Christ, <hi>hostiarum legalium purificatio paulatim coepit vilescere,</hi> the
purifying of the legall sacrifices beganne by little and little to waxe vile. Thus also expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the author of the Scholasticall historie, as <hi>Pererius</hi> sheweth in the very ende of his 10.
booke vpon Daniel: and vnlesse we ende the 70. and last weeke at the passion of Christ, it

                        <p>1. <hi>R. Shelamoh</hi> thinketh that this is vnderstood of the ceasing of the sacrifices in fact,
when the citie and Temple were destroied by the Romanes: so also <hi>Polanus</hi> and <hi>M. Lively</hi>
follow the same sense. But such ceasing of the sacrifices (<hi>de facto</hi>) actually and in fact, happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
before vnder the tyrannie of <hi>Antiochus Epimanes,</hi> Dan. 8. v. 11. 12. here such a ceasing

2. <hi>Iunius</hi> ioyneth both these together: that the sacrifices were caused to cease, both in
respect of the godly, whome Christ had sanctified by the one offering of himselfe, Hebr. 10.
14. so that they neede not to be purged by the sacrifices of the law: and in respect of the
wicked they ceased, because the Romanes tooke from the Iewes both their Temple, altar,
and sacrifices. But concerning the first, that was done many yeares before the destruction of
Ierusalem, when Christ suffered: and therefore there is no reason to restraine that benefit to
these last times: and for the other, that actuall ceasing of the sacrifices happened before, as is
said, vnder <hi>Antiochi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </p>
                        <p>3. Others expound this ceasing of the sacrifices, of the time of the Apostles after the
death of our Sauiour: as when the Apostles by their decree abrogated the ceremonies of
the Law, certaine onely excepted, in respect of the necessitie of the time, Act. 15. <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthon,
Osiand.</hi> But these doe not distinguish betweene the ceasing of the sacrifices in right,
and in fact: they in fact ceased not in the death of Christ, but in right they were then abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished.</p>
                        <p>4. Wherefore I preferre <hi>Calvins</hi> exposition, that after Christ had offered himselfe vpon
the crosse, <hi>illic cessarunt omnes ritus legales,</hi> there all the legall rites ceased: and after that, as
<hi>Oecolampad.</hi> well saith, <hi>lanienae erant, non sacrificia,</hi> the sacrifices were rather butchers
slaughters and shambles, then true sacrifices: And he yeeldeth this as a reason thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in the passion of Christ, the vaile of the Temple was rent, to shew that the sacrifices
and rites of the law were abolished. <hi>Pintus</hi> addeth this reason, because the bodie beeing
come, the shadowes must cease: like as a painter draweth his picture first with shadowed
lines, but when he portraiteth the picture, he putteth out the first lines: so our blessed Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
bringing all fulnesse and perfection with him, hath dashed out the shadowes of the law,
according to that saying in the Gospel, Ioh. 1. 17. <hi>The law was giuen by Moses, but grace and

                        <p>1. <hi>Ireneus</hi> by the abomination of desolation,<note place="margin">lib. 5. advers. haeres.</note> vnderstandeth Antichrist, of whome he i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magineth,
that he should sit in the Temple at Ierusalem, and be worshipped as the Messiah:
who is called the <hi>abomination,</hi> because of his abominable and execrable impietie; and <hi>deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi>
because he shall make desolate the Churches and worship of Christians. But seeing
that this desolation is prophesied to come vpon Ierusalem, after the death of the Messiah,
and our blessed Sauiour also referreth it to the destruction of Ierusalem, it can not be defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
so long, as to the comming of Antichrist: neither shall the Temple of the Iewes be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
againe, for any such to sit or aduance himselfe in.</p>
                        <p>2. Some referre it to the times of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> who caused an abominable Idol
to be set vp in the Temple, and the same to be called the Temple of <hi>Iuppiter Olympius,</hi> as

desolation, doe vnderstand the abominable outrages, which were committed by the sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Iewes, who filled the Temple with dead bodies, and defiled it with blood. This sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
companie called themselues <hi>zelotas,</hi> zealous men, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> writeth: but they spared
to commit no abomination, in so much that <hi>Iosephus</hi> writeth of them, that their wickednes
was such, that if the Romanes had not come against them, he thinketh, that either the earth
would haue deuoured the citie, or it should haue beene ouerflowne with water, or burnt
with fire from heauen, as Sodom was. <hi>Iosephus</hi> also in the same place testifieth, that there
was a common speach, that the citie should then be destroyed, and the Temple set on fire,
when there should rise vp sedition among the people, and the Iewes with their owne hands
first had defiled the Temple. <hi>Ioseph. lib. 5. de bell. Iudaic. c.</hi> 2. But seeing that these seditious,
though they commited many abominations in the Temple, yet the finall destruction was
not brought vpon it by them, but by the Romanes, it is not so fitly applied to them.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi>Galatinus</hi> giueth this sense; because (so he interpreteth <hi>ghal canaph,</hi> which we tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate,

there shall come desolation vpon them: But our blessed Sauiour pointeth at this <hi>abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi>

their manifold abominations. But these continuall profanations of the Temple were practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

of the Romane armie, which should compasse the citie and defile the Temple: and this they
gather by comparing the Euangelists together: whereas <hi>Matthew</hi> saith, <hi>When ye see the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination
of desolation, &amp;c. standing in the holy place, &amp;c.</hi> c. 24. 15. <hi>S. Luke</hi> thus reporteth
the words of our Sauiour, <hi>When ye see Ierusalem besieged with souldiers, then vnderstand,
that the desolation thereof is neare,</hi> c. 21. 20. And they are called the wing or armie of abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations,
because they were infidels, and strangers from God: Thus <hi>Iunius, Polanus, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rerius,
Caietan,</hi> and before them <hi>Augustine, epist. 80. ad Esychium. Pintus</hi> addeth further,
that this wing or extension of abominations, may be interpreted, <hi>extensio vexilli exercitus
Romani,</hi> the spreading of the banners of the Romane armie euen in the Temple. This expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
is very probable, and to good purpose, but yet not so fit and proper, as may appeare by
these reason<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>. 1. S. <hi>Luke</hi> speaketh of the compassing of Ierusalem with souldiers, but Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem
was not that holy place, which the other Euangelists speake of: and <hi>Murke</hi> addeth,

the souldiers compassing or besieging the citie, stood, where they ought, and vse to stand.
And beside, whereas the other Euangelists adde, <hi>spoken of by Daniel the Prophet,</hi> Luke hath

by the other; but of an other signe and forerunner of their desolation, the compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of the citie with souldiers: which Christ had told them of before, chap. 19. 43. where
he vseth the like word, <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>Oecolampad. Pellican. ex Ioseph.</hi> but these were not signes of imminent destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
3. Beside, they are admonished, when they see this abomination standing in the holy
place, to flie into the mountaines: but when the souldiers had taken the citie, and inuaded
the Temple, and set it on fire, and made hauocke of all, it was then too late to flie, all their
miserie beeing alreadie past. 4. <hi>Polanus</hi> before vnderstandeth by the people of the Prince
to come, the Gentiles, which should be called to the faith of Christ: how then doth he hold
them now to be abominable. And seeing the Lord calleth Cyrus his annointed, Isa. 45. 1.
because he executed his will vpon the Chaldeans, yea the Lord called Nabuchadnezzer
king of Babel his seruant, Ierem. 27. 6. beeing the minister of his iudgements vpon his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull
people; it seemeth to be vnfit, to call the armies of the Romanes, <hi>abominable,</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they herein were the ministers of Gods sentence decreed against Ierusalem.</p>
                        <p>9. Wherefore I rather condescend to their opinion, which thinke that this abomination
of desolation, was some abominable thing, which was set vp in the Temple, which was a
signe of the desolation thereof following: as whether it were the ensignes of the Empire,
the Romane Eagle, which Pilate brought in and set vp in the Temple, at the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Tiberius, <hi>Osiand.</hi> or rather to gratifie the Emperour, <hi>Bulling.</hi> or the image which
<hi>Caius Caligula</hi> caused to be set vp in the Temple with this inscription, <hi>Iovi illustri Caio,</hi> to

Temple, when the citie was taken: so also <hi>Ab. Ezra.</hi> But this beeing present could be no
signe of the desolation, to giue them warning after. <hi>R. Levi</hi> vnderstandeth it of the images
which <hi>Manasses</hi> caused to be set vp in the Temple, for the which it came to desolation:
but this was done before Christs time, in the daies of Antiochus. <hi>Hierome</hi> thinketh it was
the image of Adrian set vp in the ruines of the Temple; so also <hi>Severus Sulpitius:</hi> but the
Temple was destroied long before by Titus, and was not reedified againe. Therefore I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
take some of the other sensible profanations of the Temple to be vnderstood, which
were set vp after the death of Christ: as <hi>Theodoret</hi> taketh that profanation by <hi>Pilate, signum

<hi>Iosephus</hi> further writeth, that <hi>Pilate</hi> at the instance of the chiefe of the Iewes, (who went
vnto Cesarea, and offered their necks, rather then to suffer their countrey lawes to be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed)
caused those images to be remooued againe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Though <hi>Iosephus</hi> make no mention of the Temple, yet <hi>Eusebius</hi> out of <hi>Philo,</hi>
so alleadgeth: and it may be gathered also out of <hi>Iosephus</hi> report: for if the Romane en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes
had beene brought onely into the citie, the Iewes would not haue so much stood vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it: for it had beene no more, then to haue Cesars image in their coine. 2. This was done
rather after the passion of Christ, as <hi>Oecolampad.</hi> inferreth out of <hi>Iosephus.</hi> 3. And though
they were remooued, yet it is like they stood there some certaine time. 4. Neither onely is
this <hi>abomination</hi> of desolation to be restrained to the images, which Pilate brought in: but
it comprehendeth also other like profanations, as that of Caligula, before mentioned: for
the word is put in the plural (<hi>shakutzim</hi>) abominations.</p>
                        <p>Now that this is the most fit and conuenient sense of this place, our reasons are these: 1.
because this reading of the Septuagint and vulgar Latin, <hi>in the Temple shall be the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of desolation,</hi> is confirmed and warranted by our blessed Sauiour, Matth. 24. <hi>When ye shall
see the abomination of desolation standing in the holy place.</hi> 2. The abomination of desolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which was in <hi>Antiochus</hi> time, foreshewed Dan. 8. 13. &amp; 11. 31. <hi>they shall pollute the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuarie,
&amp;c. and set vp the abominable desolation,</hi> is taken in that sense: which was the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:18834:180"/>
idol of <hi>Iuppiter Olympius</hi> which was set vp vpon the altar, as appeareth, 1. Macc. 1. 57.
and <hi>Iosephus</hi> also writeth, that he caused the Sanctuarie to be called the Temple of <hi>Iuppiter
Olympius, lib. 12. antiquit. c.</hi> 7. The like meaning of the same words is also insinuated here.
3. The Hebrew word <hi>shakutz,</hi> abomination, is peculiar to idols: as 1. king. 11. 5. <hi>Milcom</hi>
is called <hi>shakutz,</hi> the abomination of the Ammonites: the abomination then, and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
thing is most properly vnderstood, to be some abominable idol set vp. 4. The word
also <hi>canaph,</hi> wing, is applied to the Sanctuarie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as Psal. 61. 4. <hi>I will dwell in thy Tabernacle for
euer, and my trust shall be vnder the couering of thy wings:</hi> where Dauid alludeth to the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims,
which strercheth out their wings, and ouershadowed the Arke. So Matth. 4. 5. the
place of the Temple whether Christ was carried in his second temptation, is called <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>,
the wing, that is the pinnacle, or battlement of the Temple. <hi>Pintus</hi> taketh the wing, for
the spreading of the banners in the Temple: <hi>R. Saadinh</hi> by the <hi>wing of abomination,</hi> interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the hand of those which taee abominable things, as swines flesh: but this is forced, and
he seemeth especially to haue reference to <hi>Antiochus</hi> times. It is most fitly therefore refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the Temple: the <hi>wing</hi> or pinacle, and part, beeing taken for the whole, <hi>Oecolamp.</hi> or
because in the inward parts were the Cherubims with their stretched-out wings, <hi>Osiand.</hi> or
rather because the Temple was in respect of the defence thereof, and Gods presence, called
the wings of God, <hi>Bulling.</hi> and it stood in the highest part of the citie, as ouershadowing
the rest, as it were with wings: see more of the diuers acceptions of this word in the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                        <p>1. <hi>R. Salomon</hi> vnderstandeth this consummation of the last battell of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi>
in the ende of the world: vntill that time should this desolation be: but then the Messiah
should ouercome all the aduersaries of the Iewes, and the citie and Temple should be reedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
againe. But the battell of Gog and and Magog was past long before Christs time, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
should the Messiah come into the world as a victorious Prince, he was to be put to
death, as here the Angel foresheweth: see this opinion before confuted, qu. 78.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Lyranus</hi> inferreth vpon these words, <hi>vsque ad consummationem &amp; finem,</hi> vnto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation
and ende, &amp;c. that, <hi>prope finem mundi, &amp;c.</hi> toward the ende of the world the
falsenesse of Antichrist beeing detected by the preaching of Henoch and Elias, the Iewes
shall be conuerted vnto Christ, and vntill that time this desolation shall be, &amp;c. But that
conceit of Henoch and Elias preaching in the ende of the world, hath no ground: neither
shall the comming of Antichrist be deferred so long vnto the ende of the world: the Iewes
conuersion is expected, but their citie and Temple shall neuer be restored againe, for that
would hinder their conuersion vnto Christ.</p>
                        <p>3. Wherefore out of this place rather it may be concluded, that this ouerthrowe of the
citie, which is here spoken of, should be the beginning of their finall and perpetuall desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which may thus further appeare.</p>
                        <p>1. This is testified in other places of the Scripture, that a finall destruction was determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
ouer this people, as Ier. 19. 11. <hi>I will breake this people and this citie, as one breaketh a
potters vessell, that cannot be made whole againe:</hi> so also the Prophet Isay saith after he had
prophesied of diuerse calamities which should fall vpon them, <hi>yet for all this his wrath is not
turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</hi> Hereunto agreeth S. Paul, speaking of the
Iewes, <hi>who both killed the Lord Iesus, and their owne Prophets, and haue persecuted vs, and
God they pleased not, and are contrarie to all men, &amp;c. for the wrath of God is come vpon them
to the vtmost, &amp;c.</hi> 1. Thess. 2. 16. And yet the Prophet Isay more euidently prophesied of the
finall ruine of the citie, c. 25. 1. 2. <hi>O Lord thou art my God, I will exalt thee: for thou hast
made of a citie an heape, of a strong citie a ruine, &amp;c. it shall neuer be built againe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. This further may appeare by comparing this desolation of Ierusalem, with the former
times of their captiuitie. In Babylon they were captiue but 70. yeares: afterward the citie and
Temple were repaired: vnder <hi>Antiochus</hi> the Temple and citie lay wast 2300. daies, Dan. 8.
14. that is, 6. yeares, 3. moneths and an halfe: But this desolation and captiuitie hath now
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:18834:181"/>
continued aboue 1500. yeares. Now whereas the Prophet <hi>Hagge</hi> saith, c. 2. 7. <hi>Thus saith
the Lord of hosts, Yet a little while, and I will shake the heauens and the earth, &amp;c. I will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                                 <desc>••</desc>
                              </gap>one
all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come:</hi> seeing that in the Prophet <hi>Hagges</hi> time,
which is almost 2000. yeares since, the Messiah was then to come within a little while, what
hope can the Iewes now haue after so many yeares to expect an other Messiah?</p>
                        <p>3. Beside, this is an euident argument of the finall and perpetuall desolation of the Iewes
citie and Temple, because they haue attempted since this destruction by <hi>Titus,</hi> to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
their Temple and Commonwealth, but they were hindred from going forward: vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperour some 64. yeares after this calamitie, the Iewes vnder their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<hi>Benchochab,</hi> or <hi>Barchochab,</hi> thought to recouer their libertie: they held 50. castles,
and 980. townes, and fortified Beth-oron: <hi>Adrian</hi> came and besieged the citie 3. yeares and
6. moneths: at the length, he tooke it, killed the captaine, and put to the sword (as <hi>Dia</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth)
50. thousand Iewes. And beside, as <hi>Eusebius</hi> saith, <hi>lib. 4. histor. Eccl. c.</hi> 6. the Iewes were
banished out of Iudea, and forbidden euer to returne to Ierusalem, which he repaired, and
called it by his owne name <hi>Aelia,</hi> that the Iewes should neuer inhabit it againe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Chrysostome</hi> also <hi>lib. 2. cont. Iud.</hi> maketh mention, how vnder the Empire of <hi>Constantine</hi>
the great, the Iewes began to rebell, and thereupon the Emperour caused their eares to be
cut off, and themselues to be dispersed among all nations, that their treacherie might be
made knowne to all the world.</p>
                        <p>After this in <hi>Iulians</hi> time the Iewes had license from the Emperour, who thought by this
meanes to disgrace the Christian religion, to build their Temple again: who busily set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
about that worke: at that time <hi>Cyrillus</hi> Bishop of Ierusalem, animated the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
shewing out of this place of Daniel, and Matth. 24. that their Temple should neuer be
builded againe: And it came so to passe: for there were three miraculous accidents, whereby
the worke was hindred. 1. after they had raised the building vpon the old foundation, all
was tumbled and cast downe in the night. 2. there came forth a fire, which consumed all
their engines and instruments. 3. there appeared bright redde markes like the crosse vpon
their garments, which they could by no meanes rubbe or wash out: and so the Iewes were
faine to giue ouer. The truth of this storie <hi>Chrysostome</hi> auoucheth, which was done but 20.
yeares before his time, <hi>oration. 2. cont. Iudaeos.</hi> And further to conuince the Iewes, he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that they were not thus crossed and hindred vnder a Christian Emperour, but vnder an
enemie to Christian religion, when Christians generally were persecuted: that this might
appeare onely to be Gods worke: this historie is reported by <hi>Ruffin. lib. 1. c.</hi> 37, 38. by <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates
lib. 3. c. 20. Theodoret. lib. 3. c.</hi> 20. And to this day the Iewes neuer were able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
in their purpose and desire, to recouer their countrey, citie, or Temple: So that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
and certentie of Daniels prophesie is euident to all the world, that <hi>desolation shall be
powred vpon them euen vnto the ende.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus haue I now by Gods speciall assistance, finished this wearisome taske, and most dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
question of Daniels weekes. In the skanning and calculating whereof, I confesse, I
was as many weekes in painfull studie and meditation, as Daniel was in heauines, when he
had that vision in the next chapter, c. 10. 2. I haue not omitted any thing to my knowledge,
that affoarded matter of doubt or question. And in such great diuersitie of opinion, which
breedeth distraction, though it be hard to finde out the best, yet I am perswaded, I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued
of the most probable and reasonable interpretation: yet so, as I will not preiudice the
iudgement of any, but leaue the Reader to his choice, not doubting, but that all reasons
weighed, circumstances duely considered, inconueniences auoided, he will incline to mine
opinion. Now I will proceede to other matters of note obserued out of this Chapter.</p>

vnto God: of the which the Apostle speaketh, 1. Thess. 5. 17. <hi>Pray continually:</hi> there is also
extraordinarie praier, when either some iudgement is feared, which we would auert and

                        <p>v. 3. Daniel onely turneth his face vnto the Lord: now if Saints were to be prayed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
Daniel had here occasion to turne himselfe vnto Ieremie, whose prophesie he maketh
mention of before: who had beene fitter to assist Daniel praying for deliuerance after the
70. yeares captiuitie, then he, who was the minister of that prophesie and promise. By this
then it is well gathered, that the invocation of Saints was not in vse in the old Testament,
<hi>Bullinger.</hi> and therefore the Prophet Dauid saith, <hi>Psal. 73. 25. Whom haue I in heauen but
thee?</hi> And the Scripture commandeth vs to worship God onely and serue him, Deut. 6. 13.
Matth. 4. v. 10. If God onely is to be worshipped, he alone must be prayed vnto, for pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is a part of his worship.</p>
                        <p>The Romanistes, for the invocation of Angels and Saints, doe alleadge these places of
Scripture: 1. Gen. 48. 16. Iakob saith, <hi>the Angel which hath deliuered me, blesse the children:</hi>
But this was no created Angel, it was Christ the sonne of God: for in the former verse he
is called God, <hi>the God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Izaak did walke, the God
which hath fedde me all my life long vnto this day, blesse, &amp;c.</hi> then it followeth in the next
verse, <hi>the Angel which hath deliuered me, &amp;c.</hi> what other Angel was it which deliuered Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,
but he that fedde him, which he saith was God?</p>
                        <p>2. That place also is vrged, Iob. 19. 21. <hi>haue pitie vpon me, haue pitie vpon me, O yee my
friends:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Bellar. lib. 1. de sanctor beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tud. c. 19.</note> which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> vnderstandeth of the Angels: But it is euident, that Iob speaketh
vnto his friends which came to visit him, who seemed to haue small compassion on him, but
with tauntes and rebukes, condemning him as an hypocrite, did adde more affliction vnto
him: for it followeth in the next verse, Why doe ye persecute me as God? they were not the
Angels of God that persecuted him, but Sathan was the chiefe instrument of his afflictions,
and his friends helped it forward.</p>
                        <p>3. That place also Apocal. 1. 4. is abused to the same purpose: <hi>Grace vnto you, and peace
from him which was, which is, and which is to come, and from the seuen spirits which are
before the throne:</hi> by these seuen spirits they vnderstand the Angels: But that cannot be. 1.
these spirits are ioyned as in equall authoritie with God the Father, and the Sonne, grace is
here ascribed indifferently to proceede from them all. 2. these spirits are set betweene the
father and the sonne, as beeing of the same power. 3. the Lambe is said to haue 7. hornes,
and seuen eyes, which are the 7. spirits, c. 5. 6. these spirits then were of the same es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
and substance with the Sonne. 4. and by the vertue of these seuen spirits the Lambe
openeth the booke with 7. seales, c. 5. 5. But Christ receiueth no vertue from the Angels. 5.
Wherefore these 7. spirits are vnderstood to be the holy Ghost, which is called <hi>septiformis,</hi>
seuenfold, <hi>quia licet vnus natura, gratiarum distributione multiplex,</hi> who though he be one
in nature, yet is manifold in the distribution of the graces, <hi>gloss. ordinar.</hi> And because Christ
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:18834:182"/>
did worke so effectually by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication of his graces in the seuen Churches, as if there
were seuen seuerall spirits,<note place="margin">Iustin. in parae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. ad Grac.</note> therefore is the spirit so described. Thus also <hi>Iustinus</hi> of auncient

and Prophet would not haue offred to haue worshipped the Angel, if it had beene
vnlawfull: he was deceiued in his person, taking him to be Christ, he erred not in offring to
adore him: for then, if it had beene an error, he would not haue done it twice: once before,
c. 19. and now againe, c. 22.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. it is euident by the text, that Iohn is reprooued of the Angel, for offring to
worship him, therefore therein was Iohns error. 2. And Iohn was not ignorant that it was
an Angel, and not Iesus himselfe: for he saith, c. 22. v. 6. <hi>the Lord God of the holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
sent his Angel to shewe vnto his seruants the things which shortly must come to passe:</hi> and
againe, v. 16. <hi>I Iesus haue sent mine Angel, to testifie vnto you these things. 3. Polanus</hi> thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
that Iohn did not commit this error twice in seeking to worship the Angel: but that
it is a repetition of that before mentioned, c. 19. But it may appeare by comparing the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that Iohn fayled herein twice: for as Peter not twice, but thrice together offended in
denying his master: so might Iohn thorough forgetfulnesse, beeing astonished with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuce

But this place is corrupted by the Iewes, and by the Romanists. 1. the Rabbines some of
them, as <hi>R. Moses, R. Saadiah,</hi> doe here vnderstand Abraham: But the faithfull of the old
Testament vsed not to call Abraham (beeing dead) their Lord: and the Prophet I say saith, c.
63. 16. <hi>that Abraham is ignorant of vs:</hi> how could he then be a mediator for them, whose
affaires he knewe not? Some other of them doe say, that the noune is put here for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noune,
as it is vsuall in the Scriptures: so that for the <hi>Lords sake</hi> is as much, as for thine owne
sake: But this phrase is vsed to take away ambiguitie: as Gen. 1. 27. <hi>God created man after
his image, after the Image of God created he him:</hi> for if he had said, after his image, it had
beene doubtfull, whether it had beene Gods or mans image: but there is no such occasion of
doubt here.</p>
                        <p>2. The Romanists here also following the Latine translation, read, <hi>propter teipsum,</hi> for
thy selfe, or for thine owne sake: But they corrupt the text euidently, the word is, <hi>Adonai,</hi>
Lord.</p>
                        <p>3. Thus Christ was acknowledged to be the Mediator in the old testament, as Psal. 80.
15. the Church prayeth, that God would visite his vine, which he had planted, and that for
<hi>his sonnes sake, whom he had made strong for himselfe:</hi> for so it is in the originall: and so in
that place read <hi>Montanus, Iunius;</hi> and the <hi>Latine interpreter,</hi> howsoeuer he fayleth here,
there readeth right. Thus Dauid desireth to be heard, <hi>for thy words sake,</hi> meaning Christ, 2.
Sam. 7. 21. And it is said he called the name of Salomon <hi>Iedidiah,</hi> beloued of God, <hi>prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Iehouam,</hi> for Iehouahs sake.</p>
                        <p>4. Thus also in the newe Testament, there is the same confession of Christ to be the
Lord and Mediator: as S. Peter Act. 2. 36. <hi>whom God hath made both Lord and Christ.</hi>
And Heb. 1. 2. he is called, <hi>the heire of all things:</hi> and Elizabeth confesseth him to be her
Lord, Luk. 1. 43. So Christ is the Lord both by his naturall right, as the Lord and Creator
of all: and <hi>iure acquisito,</hi> by the right of purchase, which is threefold: by the right of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance:
because God the father hath giuen vs as an inheritance to his sonne, as Psal. 2. v.
8. <hi>Aske of me and I will giue thee the nations for thy possession, &amp;c.</hi> by the right of redemption
we are Christs, because he hath redeemed and purchased vs with his blood, as S. Paul saith,
1. Cor. 6. 19. 20. <hi>You are not your owne, ye are bought for a price.</hi> And Christ is our Lord, by
the right of his spiritual marriage: for the husband is Lord and head of his wife, and so Christ
is of his Church.</p>
                        <p>5. But it will be obiected, that in the old Testament this phrase is often vsed, for <hi>Dauid
my seruants sake:</hi> as 1. king. 11. v. 12. 13. and 2. king. 19. 34. Hereunto it may be answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:

<pb n="364" facs="tcp:18834:183"/>
God would haue respect vnto them, but because of the Promises which the Lord

                        <p>1. The Iesuites in <hi>Censur. Coloniens. fol.</hi> 186. doe define the iustice of God, which
is reuealed in the newe Testament, to be <hi>virtutem in Deo, quam iuxta vniuscuiusque digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem

are iustified, <hi>per essentialem Dei iustitiam in nobis habitantem,</hi> by the essentiall iustice of
God dwelling in vs, and stirring vs vp vnto good workes. But this is an absurd opinion. 1.
because it confoundeth Gods iustice and righteousnesse, with the effects and operation
thereof. 2. if our righteousnesse be the essentiall iustice of God. then Christs obedience is
excluded: for that is not the essentiall iustice of God. 3. this opinion tendeth to blasphemie,
making the essentiall iustice of God, to be a qualitie in man. 4. it commeth neere the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie

vertue, infused into vs by the merit of Christ: <hi>Synod. Trident. sess. 6. c.</hi> 16. And the same is
the generall opinion of the Romanists: that we are not iustified formally by the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

comparatiuely, if it be set against other things which are prophane, or not of like holines:
for like as in the Sanctuarie, the most holy place, where the Arke was, had simply that name

the office of the Mediatourship there are two things to be vnderstood, a ministerie, and
power and authoritie: the ministeriall part, as to be borne, to fast, to preach, to suffer, to die,
Christ executed as he was man: but the power to rise againe, to ascend into the heauens, to

confirmed by these reasons taken out of this prophesie.</p>
                        <p>1. The holy ointment, wherewith they anointed their Kings and Princes, which was a
type of the spirituall anointing of the Messiah, is now abolished, and out of vse among the
Iewes: the type was to remaine vntill the bodie and substance came: it beeing now ceased, it
followeth that the Messiah, the true anointed of God, is exhibited to the world.</p>
                        <p>2. The Messiah was to be slaine before the ende of Daniels weekes, or together with the
expiring of them: but Daniels weekes are long since ended, euen by the testimonie of the
Iewes themselues: therefore the Messiah is come, and they did vnto him what they would.</p>
                        <p>3. When the Leuiticall sacrifices should cease, the Messiah was come, for his most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

                        <p>4. The blessed Messiah was to come before the destruction of the second Temple: and
therefore the Prophet saith, Hagg. 2. 10. <hi>The glorie of this last house, shall be greater then
the first:</hi> because the Messiah should come, the second Temple yet standing: as the Prophet
saith in the same place, v. 7, 8. <hi>Yet a little while, and I will mooue all nations, and the desire of

                           <hi>R. Moses</hi> of Tyrol, and <hi>Bioces,</hi> looked for the comming of Christ toward the ende of
the second Temple: which they gathered partly out of this prophesie of Daniel, partly out
of that place, Isa. 66. 7. <hi>Before her throwes came vpon her, shee was deliuered of a man child:</hi>
therefore some of the Rabbins hold, that the Messiah was borne the same day, that the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
was destroied.</p>
                        <p>In their booke called <hi>Bereshith Rabba,</hi> there is this parable: how a certaine Arabian
passing by a certain Iew, as he was at plow, hearing one of his oxen low, he bad him vnyoke,
for the destruction of Ierusalem was at hand: and hearing the other low also, he bad him
vnyoke againe, for the Messiah was alreadie come. <hi>R. Aaron</hi> telling the same parable, saith,
what neede we learne it of an Arabian, seeing the text it selfe declareth it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Iosephus l. 7. de bell. Iudaic. c.</hi> 12. writeth, that therewas a prophecie found in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that at the time of the ouerthrow of Ierusalem, there should come a king which should
raigne ouer the world, which he in flattering wise interpreted of <hi>Vespaesian.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There was an other prophesie bruted among the Iewes, that <hi>Doctor Hillels</hi> schollers
should neuer faile till Christ were come: the yongest of them was <hi>R. Iochanan</hi> the sonne of
<hi>Zacheus,</hi> who liued to see the destruction of the Temple: a little before, a certaine gate o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
it selfe, which <hi>Iosephus</hi> speaketh of in his 7. booke, c. 12. where at <hi>R. Iochanan</hi> beeing
amazed, remembred that place, Zachar. 11. 1. <hi>Open thy gates, O Lebanon, and let fire consume
thy cedars:</hi> which he applied to the destruction of the citie, which was set on fire.</p>
                        <p>Hereof it was, vpon this common receiued opinion, that the Messiah should come before
the destruction of Ierusalem, that diuers taking aduantage of the time, tooke vpon them to
be Christ: as one <hi>Theudas</hi> a Iugler, made the people beleeue, that he was a Prophet, and that
he would diuide the waters of Iordan before them, as in the time of Ioshuah: and when <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix</hi>
was gouernour, an other comming out of Egypt, making himselfe a Prophet, perswaded
the people, that if they would follow him to mount Olivet, they should see the walls of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem
fall downe. By these testimonies of the Iewes, and their owne practises it is euident,
that they expected the comming of Messiah, before the destruction of the second Temple.</p>
                        <p>Hereunto may be added that notable confession of <hi>R. Samnel,</hi> sent in an epistle to <hi>R. Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ak</hi>
aboue 600. yeares since, who vpon the euidence of this prophesie of Daniel, was conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

in the 9. chapter, to be now fulfilled: after 62. weekes Messiah shall be slaine, and a people shall
come with a Prince to come, and destroy the citie, and the house, and the destruction and deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
thereof shall be perpetuall. Now it is not to be doubted (my good Syr) but this is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:18834:185"/>
destruction and desolation in this captiuitie, wherein we are: for now there are a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
yeares since, and the Lard plainly saith by his Prophet, that the desolation shall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
for the killing of Christ, as our desolation is after the slaying of Christ: for the Lord
threatned not perpetuall desolation, but after the slaying of Christ. And if we will say, that
before the killing of Christ, we were in desolation, the Christians will answer vs, that before his
death we had but a desolation for 70. yeares: and after this we were brought into the land of
promise, and were in grace and fauour with God. Truely (Sir) I see no evasion: for it is prooued
vnto vs in fact, that after seuentie weekes of yeares were fulfilled from the reedifying of the
Temple, then was Iesus slaine of our fathers: and afterward came a captaine, euen Titus, and
the people of Rome, and did vnto vs according to this prophesie. Now a thousand yeares are
past, and we are notwithstanding vnder Gods wrath, and yet we trust in him, expecting a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah
to come: and that we shall returne into the land of promise, and restore the citie and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and that we shall be in fauour with God, and so this desolation not to be perpetuall, but
temporall. Alas (Sir) this excuse and euasion hangeth not together, and such expectation see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth

                        <p>A more plentifull and euident testimonie can we not haue, then from this learned Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin,
who giueth a most perfect and sound exposition of Daniels propheticall weekes. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then it is euident, that the Messiah is come, who els can he be but Christ Iesus: in whome
all these things are fulfilled, prophesied of the Messiah. 1. the anointing is now ceased. 2.
so are all the Leuitical sacrifices since his death. 3. he came while the second Temple stood.
4. and suffered after 490. yeares from the reedifying of the citie and Temple. 5. imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
vpon his death the citie and Temple was destroied. 6. and the same destruction is
like to be perpetuall, hauing continued almost 1600. yeares, according to this prophesie of

                     <p>IN these three last chapters, the 10, 11, 12. the fourth and last vision, which Daniel had,
is set forth: whereof there are three parts. 1. the preparation to the vision, contained
in the 10. chapter. 2. the propheticall vision it selfe, in the 11. chapter. 3. the conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
ministred vnto Daniel, after the prediction of such heauie things.</p>
                     <p>In the preparation, or preamble to the vision in the 11. chap. there are these fowre parts.
1. the summe of the vision in generall, to v. 5. 2. a description of the glorious person that
appeared, to v. 7. 3. the effect that followed, Daniel and his companions feare, v. 7. to the
10. 4. the erection and animating of Daniel by the Angel, v. 10. to the 21.</p>
                     <p>1. In the generall summe, 1. the time is expressed. 2. the person to whome the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was reuealed, to Daniel. 3. the manner of the vision: for the certentie, it was true: for
the continuance, long: for the clearenes, he vnderstood it. 4. then the disposition of Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
is shewed, how he was affected, when this vision came: he was in heauines: the effects
whereof were, <hi>he eate no pleasant bread,</hi> v. 3.</p>
                     <p>2. In this description, 1. the circumstances are set forth, the time and place, v. 4. 2.
the glorious person described by his forme, he was as a man, by his rayment, v. 5. by his
parts and voice, v. 6.</p>
                     <p>3. The feare of Daniel and his companions is diuersly set forth: they fled away and hid
themselues, v. 7. Daniel staied by it, though his strength was much abated, v. 8. and the
cause of this great feare is shewed; the hearing of the voice like thunder, v. 9.</p>
                     <p>4. The erecting and animating of Daniel, is set forth in fowre degrees. 1. the first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
is in setting Daniel vpon his knees, and the palmes of his hands, which was caused
partly by an hand that touched him, v. 10. partly by words, v. 11.</p>
                     <p>2. In the second degree, he standeth, but trembling: the comfort is ministred by the
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:18834:186"/>
speaking of the Angel: where he sheweth, 1. when he was first sent forth, v. 12. 2. what
was the cause of his stay, v. 13. 3. to what ende he came, v. 14.</p>
                     <p>3.In the third degree is shewed, 1. the Prophets infirmitie: he set his face toward the
ground, but held his tongue, v. 15. 2. the consolation, an hand touched his lippes. 3. the
effects: he speaketh shewing his feare, v. 16. and the cause thereof, v. 17.</p>
                     <p>4. In the fourth and last degree, 1. the Prophets infirmitie is expressed, his great feare,
v. 17. 2. the erection of him, partly by gesture, an hand toucheth him, v. 18. partly by
speach. 3. the effects, Daniel speaketh boldly to the Angel. 4. the Angel declareth three
things: 1. of his fighting with the Prince of Persia. 2. of the comming of the Prince of
Grecia. 3. of the assistance and helpe of Michael the Prince of Gods people.</p>

and the two next vnto Daniel.</head>
                        <p>This vision, which <hi>Lyranus</hi> counteth the ninth from the beginning of this booke, c. 2. but
indeede it is but the fourth vision, which Daniel properly had, beginning at the 7. chapter:
It is a most worthie and excellent vision in diuers respects. 1. because of the preparation:
Daniel fasted and humbled himselfe 3. weekes of daies, before this vision was shewed vnto
him. 2. The reuealer of this vision, was the chiefe of the Angels, euen Christ himselfe, as is
further shewed, qu. 12. following, who appeared not in the ordinarie shape of a man, but in
a glorious manner, <hi>his bodie was as the Chrysolite, and his face like lightning, &amp;c.</hi> v. 6. <hi>Perer.</hi>
3. Whereas other visions were darke and obscure, this vision is plaine and manifest: and
therefore it is said, <hi>the word is true,</hi> or proper, not figuratiue. <hi>H. B.</hi> 4. This vision is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and contained in these three last chapters, which was all one vision: so were not any of
the other so long continued and produced. <hi>Iun. Polan.</hi> 5. It is saide, the time was long,
when these things should be fulfilled, many yeares after: some read, <hi>and the power and force
is great:</hi> for the word is <hi>tzaba,</hi> which signifieth an armie, and so some of the Rabbins vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
here an armie of Angels, which appeared to Daniel: but the first seemeth to be the
better sense, <hi>Iun. Polan.</hi> Some thinke, that this was a long prophesie, the accomplishment
whereof is extended vnto the ende of the world, <hi>Bulling. Perer.</hi> But, though in the last
chapter mention be made by occasion of the resurrection, yet this prophesie was properly
fulfilled before the times of the Messiah: though typically it may be applied to the times
succeeding; as concerning the perfection of Antichrist prefigured by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and other
accidents, which did befall the Church of Christ.</p>

be vnderstood.</head>
                        <p>1. Some Greeke copies here for the third yeare, doe read the first yeare of Cyrus: the
occasion of which error <hi>Theodoret</hi> thinketh to be this, because it is said, c. 1. 21. that Daniel
was vnto the first yeare of Cyrus: which doubt <hi>Theodoret</hi> thus taketh away, because in the
originall it is saide, <hi>vnto one</hi> yeare of Cyrus, not <hi>to the first:</hi> But it is euident, that in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
phrase, <hi>one</hi> is taken for the <hi>first:</hi> the solution then is this, that Daniel continued in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
with the Babylonian kings, and ministred vnto them, as long as that Monarchie
continued, and then he serued <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Darius. Lyran. Perer. Polan.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="373" facs="tcp:18834:187"/>
2. This third yeeare of Cyrus some vnderstand to be the 4. yeare from the solution of
the captiuitie: first Darius raigned one yeare, and died in the beginning of the next, and then
Cyrus succeeded: But Cyrus and Darius raigned together, because it is said c. 1. 21. that Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
was vnto the first of Cyrus, which was in the first of Darius also, for otherwise he should
be omitted with whom Daniel was in great grace.</p>
                        <p>3. The better opinion is that Cyrus in the verie first yeare, when Babylon was taken,
gaue the Iewes libertie to returne, in the second yeare they beganne to build, and were
the same yeare hindred, and in the beginning of the third yeare this vision was reuealed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Daniel.</p>
                        <p>4. This was the third and last yeare of Cyrus raigne ouer the Persian Monarchie: who
raigned 30. yeares in all, and in the 28. yeare of his raigne ouer Persia, he tooke Babylon,
<hi>Polan. Pellican.</hi> he did not raigne 30. after the taking of Babylon, as <hi>M. Liuely, Pererius,</hi>
with others thinke.</p>

vision.</head>
                        <p>Here is to be considered a threefold distinction of those which haue visions.</p>
                        <p>1. Some haue visions, but they vnderstand them not: such were Pharaoh, Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,
and Balthazar:<note place="margin">lib. 11. Moral. cap. 12.</note> and of these <hi>Gregorie</hi> saith, <hi>cum aliquid ostenditur, &amp; intellectus non tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buitur,
prophetia minime est,</hi> when any thing is shewed, and vnderstanding not giuen, it is
no prophesie:<note place="margin">lib. 12. de Gen. ad liter. c. 9.</note> neither are they Prophets to whom such things are shewed, &amp;c. And <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi>
saith, <hi>magis Ioseph Propheta fuit qui intellexit, &amp;c.</hi> Ioseph was rather a Prophet, who
vnderstood the dreame, then Pharaoh, which had it and vnderstood not.</p>
                        <p>2. Some there are which may vnderstand in some sort, and haue the gift of prophesying,
and yet not be in the state of grace: such an one was Balaam, who vttered most cleare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies
of things to come. And that the gift of prophesie may be separated from the grace
of God, and charitie, the Apostle sheweth, 1. Cor. 13. 2. <hi>If I had the gift of prophesie, &amp;c.
and had no loue, I were nothing, Pintus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. But there are some, which are the faithfull seruants and true Prophets of God, who
haue both the gift of Prophesie, with the vnderstanding therof, and are also in Gods fauour,
and in the state of grace: such an one was Daniel.</p>

himselfe here <hi>Belteshazzar</hi> for these cause. 1. <hi>voluit hoc vaticinium celebre esse per omnes
nationes,</hi> he would haue this prophesie famous among all nations, where he was knowne ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the name of <hi>Belteshazzar,</hi> then by the name of Daniel, <hi>Calvin.</hi> 2. by this meanes,
though he were called by a strange name, yet he would make it knowne, <hi>se non alienum esse
à populo Dei,</hi> that he was not enstranged from the people of God, but continued still in
their communion. 3. And hereby also Daniel intimateth, that he was the same man, vnto
whom the former visions were shewed, and the vnderstanding of secret things: and so by
this meanes this vision was receiued with greater credit and authoritie, <hi>Polan.</hi>

                        <head>Quest. 5. v. 2. Why Daniel was so long in
heauines.</head>
                        <p>1. <hi>Theodoret</hi> thinketh, this was one cause thereof, because all of the Iewes hauing liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to returne, yet many of them, beeing in loue with the pleasures of Babylon, <hi>neglect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

patriam reditu tanto beneficio vti noluerunt,</hi> neglecting to returne into their countrey, would
not vse so great a benefit: But if this had beene the cause, Daniel would not haue deferred
the time of mourning so long, for this backewardnesse of the people was knowne in the 1.
yeare of Cyrus, when the people had licence to returne.</p>
                        <p>2. An other cause of Daniels mourning is supposed to haue beene the remembrance and
consideration of so many heauie things, as were foreshewed him in time to come to befall
his people.</p>
                        <p>3. As also because it was reuealed vnto him, to what blindnesse and obstinacie his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
should growe, as to put to death the Messiah, <hi>Perer.</hi> But if either of these had beene the
cause, Daniel would not haue put off his mourning so long: for the first was signified vnto
him in the 3. of Balthazar, c. 8. and the other in the 1. of Darius, c. 9. But this mourning
of Daniel was in the 3. yeare of Cyrus, two yeares after.</p>

                           <pb n="374" facs="tcp:18834:188"/>
4. Therefore this indeede was the cause: the people which were returned had begunne
to reedifie the Temple, and presently they were hindred by <hi>Cambyses,</hi> Cyrus beeing occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied
in warres abroad: this hard newes came to Daniel in Persia, and therefore he mourneth,
entreating the Lord that the businesse might goe forward, <hi>Iun. Polan. Oecolampad. Pellic.</hi>
with others.</p>

three weekes of dayes.</head>
                        <p>1. This is added (of dayes) by way of distinction, because in the former chapter he had
spoken of weekes of yeares, <hi>Polan.</hi> 2. Some thinke he mourned 3. weeks, to signifie the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
<hi>gloss. interlin.</hi> but that is too curious. 3. Some, because the people hauing leaue to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
in the first of Cyrus, had deferred their iourney vntill this 3. yeare, and therefore
Daniel mourneth 3. weeks, for euerie yeare a weeke, least this negligence should haue beene
layd vnto the peoples charge, <hi>Hugo:</hi> but this is contrarie to the storie, Ezra. 2. where it is
declared that they beganne to build the Temple in the second yeare, therefore they did not
put off their returne vnto the third yeare. 4. Further <hi>Hugo</hi> hath an other conceit: that as
Daniel fasted 21. dayes before the Angel appeared, which represented Christ, so the Church
hath the like vse to fast 21. dayes before the aduent: But such superstitious customes are not
grounded vpon either precept or example in Scripture: superstition was the mother and
founder of such inuentions. 5. This then was the cause: Daniel herein sheweth his constancie,
not that sorrowe is valued before God by the length of time: but Daniel continueth in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
and prayer, expecting still some comfortable answer from God: he therefore giueth not
ouer vntill he sawe that the Lord graciously inclined vnto his prayer, <hi>Iun.</hi> 6. And in that he
fasted 21. dayes in the 1. moneth, the 1. day, which was the newe moone, which they were
commanded by the lawe to keepe with reioycing, seemeth to be excepted, <hi>Iun.</hi> 7. And
whereas within this time they vsed to keepe the Passeouer, which was a time also of reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
it seemeth that in the captiuitie that solemnitie was omitted, and so thinketh <hi>R. Leui:</hi>
whereupon <hi>Theodoret</hi> reprooueth the Iewes in his time, who vsed to celebrate the Pasch,
with all the rites and ceremonies thereto belonging, wheresoeuer they were, whereas by
Moses lawe it was onely to be kept in the place which the Lord should chuse.</p>

of pleasant bread or meate, it seemeth that before he vsed them: so that Daniels abstinencie,
when he did chuse at the first to be fedde onely with bread made of pulse, c. 1. seemeth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Hugo Cardinal.</hi> of the same opinion is <hi>Calvin, Bullinger, Osiander,</hi> that this was an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel.
And <hi>Pereius</hi> reason is, because in the visions shewed vnto Daniel, c. 8. 9. the Angel
Gabriel is expressed by name, that wat sent to declare the meaning of the vision to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet:
But it followeth not, that therefore this was the Angel Gabriel which appeared in this
glorious manner: It was the Angel Gabriel which afterward speaketh with Daniel; but it
was Christ which in this glorious manner manifested himselfe.</p>
                        <p>2. The reasons to confirme this, that Christ himselfe appeared, are these: 1. <hi>Hyppolitus</hi>
vrgeth the difference betweene the apparition of Gabriel before, and this here: for he is said
before c. 9. to come fleeing as a ministring Angel; but here is no such thing: he that appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
now, sheweth himselfe in his maiestie, as the Lord, himselfe. 2. <hi>Pappus</hi> inferreth as much
out of v. 17. because Daniel calleth this Angel Lord, and himselfe his seruant: but the holy
Prophets did not call themselues the Angels seruants: the Angels did rather acknowledge
them to be their fellowe seruants, Reuel. 22. 8. 3. <hi>Iunius</hi> and <hi>Polanus</hi> doe prooue the same
by that place, c. 12. 6. where one, namely an Angel, speaketh thus vnto the man cloathed in
linen, <hi>When shall be an ende of these wonders?</hi> this was Christ then, of whom the angels learne
the knowledge of things to come: who is called c. 8. 13. <hi>Palmoni,</hi> one that hath secrets in
account: to whom one of the Angels propounded the like question. 4. this vision agreeth
with that Reuelat. 1. almost in euerie respect: But there Christ appeared in this manner, in
a long rayment, girded about with a golden girdle, his eyes were as flames of fire, his
feete as fine brasse, his voice as the sound of waters: And so doth Christ appeare here, in a
long white garment, his face as lightening, his eyes as flames of fire, his armes and feete like
polished brasse, his voice, like the voice of a multitude: the likenesse and agreement of the
apparitions sheweth that he was the same, which in both places appeared.</p>
                        <p>3. Now this strong obiection there is, that it was not Christ but an Angel which appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
because afterward v. 13. he speaketh of Michael the Prince which came to helpe him,
which Michael is vnderstood to be Christ: &amp; Christ needed not to be helped: beside he saith,
v. 11. <hi>vnto thee am I now sent.</hi> But Christ is none of the missiue or ministring Angels, he
sendeth them, he is not sent.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Some here answer, that though Michael afterward be vnderstood to be Christ,
yet in this place, Michael signifieth one of the principall Angels, <hi>Pappus.</hi> But that seemeth
not so fit, in the same prophesie, and at the same time, by Michael to vnderstand not one and
the same, but diuerse.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Oecolampadius,</hi> who holdeth this to be Christ that appeared in this maiestie, thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreteth
those words, <hi>now I am sent to thee: placuit pairivt te nunc consoler,</hi> it pleaseth my
father that I now should come to comfort thee: But we doe not finde, that Christ as the
sonne of God, is said to be sent of his father: as he was man he was sent into the world: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
he giueth this sense of the other words, <hi>Michael helped me, hunc meum erga vos fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorem
magis declarauit,</hi> the Angel Michael <hi>hath more declared my fauour toward you:</hi> so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<hi>Pellican.</hi> but it may seeme an harsh and hard speach in any sense, to say that Christ is hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
of the Angels.</p>
                        <p>3. Therefore this is our answer, that it was the person of Christ the sonne of God, which
was seene of Daniel in that great maiestie: And he is that Michael afterward spoken of: But
it was the Angel Gabriel that had the communication with Daniel: for the Prophet himselfe
distinguisheth the person of the Angel, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him that appeared in that glorie: as v. 16. he saith,
<hi>I said vnto him that stood before me:</hi> that was another beside Christ that appeared: whom
the Prophet pointeth out by the pronoune demonstratiue dubled, v. 17. <hi>how can the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
of my Lord talke with that my Lord, Polan.</hi> So c. 8. 16. there is the like distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the Angel Gabriel, and another that spake vnto him in a mans voice, called before
<hi>Palmoni,</hi> v. 13. the like also see, c. 12. 5. where one of the Angels standing by the riuer,
speaketh vnto the man cloathed in linen, that is vnto Christ, to know when should be the
ende of those things.</p>

1. yet sometime Christ appeareth with a garment dipped and besprinkled with blood, as
Isay. 63. v. 1. 2. and Apoc. 19. v. 13. but that is in a diuerse sense: he hath a bloodie gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

the word is <hi>tarshish,</hi> which is diuersely taken: for it signifieth the Sea, then a countrey in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,
from whence Salomon had his gold, 1. king. 10. 22. and there was a pretious stone
of that name, Exod. 28. 20. And sometime it is taken for Carthage, as where it is said,
Ezeck. 27. the merchaunts were of Tarshish; the Septuag. read, the Carthaginians were thy
merchants: But for <hi>Tharsus</hi> the chiefe citie of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> it is neuer taken, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> thinketh
<hi>lib. 1. antiquit.</hi> to this purpose <hi>Pererius.</hi> In which obseruation of his, this may be excepted
against, 1. he thinketh that Tarshish is a countrey in India: but no such thing is gathered in
that place, 1. king. 10. mention is made onely of the shippes of Tarshish, that is, of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean
sea which brought Salomons gold. 2. In that place of Ezechiel, the Cilicians, or any
other inhabiting vpon the sea, may as well be vnderstood, as the Carthaginians. 3. And it is
euident, that Ionas 1. 3. by Tarshish Tarsus of Cilicia is vnderstood, which was so called of
Tarshish one of the sonnes of <hi>Iavan</hi> the sonne of Iapheth, Gen. 10. 4. And this may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
by the words of the text, <hi>he payed his fare, and went downe into the ship that he might
goe with them to Tarshish:</hi> this is not here vnderstood to be the Sea, for as soone as he was
in the ship, he was in the sea: and the mariners intended their course to some certaine place,
not to saile vp and downe in the sea: Therefore <hi>Hierome</hi> neede not to haue found so much
fault with <hi>Rheticius</hi> Bish. of <hi>Augustadunum,</hi> for taking <hi>Tarshish</hi> here for <hi>Tarsus</hi> in <hi>Cilicia,
epist. 133. ad Mar.</hi> 4. Further this <hi>Tarshish</hi> here cannot be the Chrysolite, which is a pretious
stone yellowish like gold, as <hi>Plinie</hi> writeth, that <hi>Aethiopia</hi> sendeth forth Chrysolites, <hi>aureo
colore translucentes,</hi> which shine with a golden colour, <hi>lib. 37. c.</hi> 9. and so <hi>Hugo de S. Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctore</hi>
saith, <hi>Chrysolithus fulget quasiaurum,</hi> the Chrysolite shineth like gold: as the word sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth:
But <hi>Tarshish</hi> properly signifying the Sea, must be here taken for a pretious stone of
sea or skie colour: See more hereof, <hi>Hexapl. in Exod. quest.</hi> 21. 10. 5. But <hi>R. Saadiah</hi> his
conceit here is verie strange, who thinketh this glorious bodie to be likened to the Sea, for
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:18834:190"/>
the height thereof: the Sea is 2000. cubites deepe, as he soundeth the depth, and so imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
that here appeared a shape of an huge proportion, farre exceeding the statute of a Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant:
But in that the text saith, there was <hi>a man cloathed in linen,</hi> thereby is signified that he
appeared in the ordinarie shape of a man.</p>
                        <p>6. For the signification hereof: some thinke that this skie colour signifieth immortalitie,
<hi>Pintus,</hi> or the celestiall nature of the Angels, <hi>Oecolamp,</hi> rather it betokeneth, that Christ
is the Lord of heauen, <hi>Iun. comment.</hi> and that he is the Lord heauen, as the Apostle
speaketh, 1. Cor. 15. 47. <hi>Polan.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>7. But it will be questioned how the colour of his bodie could be perceiued, seeing it
was couered with a linen garment: <hi>Pererius</hi> answereth, that it appeared as a most fine linen
garment, thorough the which the heauenly colour of his body might be seene.</p>
                        <p>2. His face was like the lightening. So we reade, that Christs face in the mountaine did
shine as the Sunne: Hereby is signified the excellencie of his glorie, <hi>Pintus:</hi> and his terror a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his enemies, <hi>Perer.</hi> and as the lightening, <hi>&amp; fulget, &amp; terret,</hi> both shineth bright, and
terrifieth, so Christ is terrour to the wicked, and a comfortable light to the righteous,
<hi>Oecolamp. Bulling.</hi> But it rather sheweth <hi>celerrimam eius ad omnia presentiam,</hi> his swift
presence in euerie place: as lightening appeareth quickly from the East to the West, Mat. 24.
27. <hi>Iun. Polan.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. His eyes were as lampes of fire: so he is described Apocal. 1. that his eyes appeared as
flames of fire: whereby is signified <hi>ardor amoris,</hi> his ardent loue, <hi>Perer.</hi> or the perspicui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of Angels, <hi>Lyran. Pintus.</hi> or <hi>quia illuminat oculos,</hi> because he lighteneth the eyes of the
minde, <hi>Bulling,</hi> and <hi>inflammat impios,</hi> he consumeth the wicked, <hi>Oecolamp,</hi> rather hereby
is signified, that all things are manifest to Christs eyes, and nothing can be hidden from him,
as the Aposte sheweth, Hebr. 4. 13.</p>
                        <p>4. His armes and feete were like polished brasse. <hi>Ammonius</hi> by the armes vnderstandeth
the fathers of old time, by the feete, the faithfull that are now, all which as the armes and
feete belong vnto one bodie: but this is farre fetcht: some applying it to the Angels doe giue
this sense, thereby they will haue signified their great strength, <hi>ad operandum per brachia, ad
mouendum per pedes,</hi> to worke with their hands, and mooue with their feete, <hi>Lyran. Pint.
Perer.</hi> some referre it to the life and works of Christ, which did shine, <hi>Oecolamp.</hi> But more
properly it sheweth the great power of Christ, <hi>in rebus agendis efficacissimam,</hi> most effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
in doing and working of things, <hi>Iun. commentar.</hi> and in treading and trampling vpon his
enemies, as if one should stampe vpon an earthen vessell with yron or brasen shooes. <hi>Polan.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>5. Lastly this glorious and goodly man is described by his voice, which was as the voice
of a multitude. 1. <hi>Albertus</hi> thinketh that this Angel was accompanied with many Angels
beside, for the greater consolation of Daniel, and so his voice with the rest seemed as the
voice of a multitude: But Daniel saith <hi>the voice of his words, was as the voice of a multitude,</hi>
he speaketh of the voice not of many, but of one. 2. The Lord vseth before any notable
vision to send a great noise or sound, as Ezech. 1. 24. the sound of the wings of the beasts
which appeared, was as the noise of great waters: and Christs voice was like a trumpet,
Reuel. 1. 10. and as the noise of many waters, Reuel. 1. 15. So before the comming of the
Holy Ghost, there was a mightie rushing winde, Act. 2. 2. and this the Lord doth to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
his seruants, to whom he reuealed himselfe, that they should attend with greater reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
<hi>Polan.</hi> 3. Now this sound Daniel heard at the first, but he setteth it in the last
place: because it is the manner of the Prophets to speake of that last, where the narration
following is to beginne, as afterward v. 9. he sheweth how he was astonished at the hearing
of this mightie voice, <hi>Iun. comment.</hi> 4. For the signification of this voice, 1. <hi>Calvin</hi> thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
that it was onely to this ende, to discerne this Angel from the common sort of men: but
there was more in it. 2. <hi>Hyppolitus</hi> by the many waters vnderstandeth the multitude of the
faithfull; All that beleeue, <hi>eloquia Christi sonamus,</hi> doe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ound forth the words of Christ. 3.
they which apply it to an Angel, doe signifie thereby the singular facultie of the Angels, <hi>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

arcana,</hi> in declaring hid things. <hi>Perer. Lyran. Bullin.</hi> 4. But it rather sheweth the
mightie power of Christ in teaching of men, whose one voice preuayleth more then the
voice of many beside, <hi>Polan.</hi> as in the Gospel it is said of our blessed Sauiour, Math. 7. 29.
<hi>he taught them, as one hauing authoritie, not as the Scribes:</hi> the teaching of Christ onely was
more effectuall and of greater power, then all the babling of the Scribes and Pharisies.</p>

alone.</head>
                        <p>1. The Hebrewes thinke, that all this was done in vision, and that Daniel imagined, that
Hagge, Zacharie, and Malachie were present, to whome yet so much was not reuealed as to
him: But the description which followeth afterward of their fleeing and hiding themselues,
sheweth, that it was done in deede. 2. Some thinke that the rest saw not this vision, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they were afraid, and durst not looke vp. <hi>Iun. in commentar.</hi> But the like thing happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
rather here vnto Daniels companions, which did befall those which accompanied Paul,
Act. 9. they saw not the vision, onely Pauls eyes were opened to perceiue it. <hi>Iun. annotat.</hi>
3. But where it is said, Act. 9. 7. that the men <hi>which iourneied with Paul, heard a voice, but
saw no man:</hi> and yet, Act. 22. 9. it is saide, that <hi>they saw a light, but heard not the voice:</hi> the
meaning is, that they heard Pauls voice answering, but not the voice of Christ speaking vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him: and they saw a light confusedly, but distinctly they saw not him, which was both
seene and heard of Paul. 4. <hi>Pintus</hi> thinketh that they saw in deede the Angel, but percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
not what he said, and therefore they are said, not to haue seene the vision: so also <hi>Lyran.</hi>
but the text euidently sheweth, that they did not see the vision at all, but Daniel onely saw
it: they heard the sound, and therewith were astonished, and fled away, but they saw no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
5. <hi>Calvin</hi> thinketh, that Daniel was in his chamber at this time, and in his spirit
onely by the riuer, and so falling into a traunce, the rest were stricken with a terrour: But if
Daniel in spirit onely had seene this vision absent, it were needelesse to say, that the rest saw
it not: for how could they see a thing absent. 6. In that Daniel had companie and witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
present, it so sell out by Gods prouidence, that the truth of this vision, which Daniel af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
was to communicate to the Church, should not be doubted of. <hi>Polan.</hi>

                        <p>v. 8. <hi>There remained no strength in me.</hi> It was vsuall with the holy Prophets and seruants
of God to be stricken with a great feare, when they receiued any vision: as Ieremie saith, <hi>c.</hi>
23. 9. <hi>Mine heart breaketh within me, &amp;c. for the presence of the Lord, and for his holy
words:</hi> so Habac. 3. 2. <hi>O Lord, I haue heard thy voice, and was afraid:</hi> likewise Dan. c. 7. 28.
<hi>My cogitations troubled me, and my countenance changed in me:</hi> &amp;c. 8. 27. <hi>I Daniel was stric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and sicke certaine daies:</hi> Thus were the holy Prophets affected in these visions. Now
these reasons may be alleadged of this their feare:</p>
                        <p>1. The great maiestie and glorie which appeareth vnto them, farre exceeding mans ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie,
maketh them afraid, and abateth their strength: as this was a most glorious sight
which here was shewed to Daniel: If we can not behold the Sunne without dazeling of the
eyes, how much lesse is man able to behold such excellent brightnes.</p>
                        <p>2. The heauie things, which were declared in those visions, did also terrifie them: as the
prediction of the calamities and miseries which should befall the people of God, cast Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
into a sicke fit, c. 8.</p>
                        <p>3. It is the qualitie and condition of spirituall contemplation, that the more the minde is
intent thereupon, the lesse vigour and strength the bodie hath, all the powers of nature ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and applying themselues to the disposition of the minde: as <hi>Gregorie</hi> obserueth well,
<hi>cum ad virtutem Dei mens astringitur, à propria fortitudine caro lassatur,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">lib. 4. mor. c. 30.</note> when the minde is
bent toward God, the strength of the flesh is abated, &amp;c. and this he resembleth fitly to Iaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs
halting after he had wrestled with the Angel.</p>
                        <p>4. By this meanes man seeth his owne infirmitie, and the greater euidence he hath of
Gods power and glorie, the more he seeth into his owne estate, and feeleth his owne wants:
As Abraham beeing admitted to that familiar conference with God, Gen. 18. confessed
himselfe to be dust and ashes: Moses who thought himselfe some bodie before, as beeing
brought vp in the learning of the Egyptians, yet after he had talked with God, he then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne
to see his imperfection, that he was flow of speech, Exod. 4. 10. and the Prophet Isai,
after he had that vision, c. 6. crieth out, that he was a man of polluted lippes: to this purpose

                        <head>17. Quest. Whose hand it was that touched Daniel.</head>
                        <p>1. <hi>Iunius</hi> in his commentarie, by this hand vnderstandeth the spirit of God, by the
which we are comforted: as Ezekiel saith, c. 1. 3. <hi>the hand of God was vpon me by the riuer
Chebar:</hi> But this thing was not mystically, but histotically<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> done: yet this hand was <hi>symbolum

                           <pb n="380" facs="tcp:18834:191"/>
2. Some take this for the hand of the Angel, which appeared in that glorious manner
vnto Daniel before, <hi>Hierome, Pintus, Calvin, Genevens.</hi> But it is shewed before, that it was
not an Angel which there appeared, but Christ himselfe.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Lyranus</hi> hath this conceit, that the same Angel touched Daniel as it were with a
mans hand, but in an other shape, then he appeared at the first: for the Angels can easily
change their shape. But there is no reason to suppose, that in the same vision, the same An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
should assume a diuers shape, neither doe I thinke that the like can be shewed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                        <p>4. Some thinke that this was Christ who touched Daniels lippes: and this <hi>Polanus</hi>
would confirme by these two reasons. 1. because it is God that vsed at other times to
touch the Prophets lippes, and to strengthen them: as Ierem. 1. 9. and Revel. 1. 17. 2. he is
said to be <hi>like the similitude of the sonne of man,</hi> v. 16. and so Christ is described, c. 7. 13. <hi>one
like the sonne of man, Answ.</hi> 1. True it is that God onely giueth strength and vtterance,
but the Angels also may be as ministers of Gods worke, though they doe it not by their
owne power: as Gabriel touched Daniel and strengthened him, c. 8. 18. And <hi>Polanus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
vpon the 18. v. saith, that the Angel, <hi>tanquam administer Dei,</hi> as Gods minister did
strengthen Daniel. 2. v. 18. he saith, <hi>one like the appearance of man touched me:</hi> there he
sheweth what he meant before, by the similitude of the sonnes of men: for not onely Christ
appeared in vision as a man, but the Angels also, as Gabriel c. 8. 15. appeared in the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of a man: and c. 9. 21. he is called the man Gabriel.</p>
                        <p>5. Therefore I subscribe to <hi>Iunius</hi> in his annotations, that this was the Angel that tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
Daniel, because the same that speaketh, toucheth, as may appeare v. 11. 19. And <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>
saith, that the Angel touched him with a mans hand, <hi>vt sui generis corpus aspiciens,</hi>
that seeing a bodie of his owne kind, he should not be afraid: but the armes which Christ
appeared with, were as polished brasse, and therefore not of the same kind: and Daniel would
haue beene more afraid, to haue beene touched with such glorious hands. So that hereby
it is euident, that the hand which touched Daniel was an ordinarie mans hand: it was not
then the hand of that glorious bodie, which appeared before, v. 4.</p>

the very first day, that he humbled himselfe, why the Angel came not till now, which

his stay.</p>

                        <head>19. Quest. What it was that Daniel praied for, and how
he was heard.</head>
                        <p>1. Some thinke that Daniel here praied for the returne of the people out of captiuitie,
which was graunted by Cyrus, <hi>sed non sine magna disceptatione,</hi> but not without great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation
and opposition, the Deuill interposing himselfe to hinder this busines. But the
people returned out of captiuitie two yeares before this in the first of Cyrus, for which
thing Daniel had prayed for before, c. 9. Of this opinion seemeth also to haue beene the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the <hi>interlinearie glosse,</hi> Daniel praied <hi>vt captivus populus sub Dario relaxetur,</hi> that
the captiue people vnder Darius might be released: he meaneth Darius the Mede, that raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with Cyrus: by whome, as <hi>Hugo Card<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> noteth, <hi>initum fuit consilium,</hi> the counsell first
was begunne for the peoples returne. But this, as I said, was done two yeares before this
prayer of Daniel.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Lyranus</hi> thinketh, that although this libertie were graunted by Cyrus, yet because
most of the Iewes were borne in the captiuitie, which had continued from the first taking
of the citie in Iehoiakims raigne 70. yeares, from Iehoiachins carrying away 66. from Zede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah
56. yeares, they beeing in loue with Babylon, where they had possessions, and there
were borne, deferred their going two yeares: and so Daniel feared, <hi>ne totum hoc negotium
de eorum reditu impediretur,</hi> least that all this busines concerning their returne might be
hindred, &amp;c. But it is euident that the returne of the Iewes out of captiuitie was not so
long put off: for they according to Cyrus edict returned in the first yeare, and in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
yeare the seuenth moneth, they beganne to build the house of God, Ezr. 3. 1.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Pintus</hi> thinketh that Daniels desire was to know, what should become afterward of
the Persian Monarchie, and what should befall the people of God: But though these things
be afterward reuealed to Daniel, c. 11. yet that was not it for the which Daniel was in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines
three weekes of daies. The Lord graunteth more, then he desired, and reuealed vnto
him things to come, as c. 9. Daniel onely praied for the temporall deliuerance of the people,
but he is iustructed also by the Angel concerning the Messiah, which should bring spirituall
deliuerance, and redemption.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Pererius</hi> thinketh that Daniel prayed, that the rest of the Iewes which remained yet
behind, might returne also into their countrey: but Daniel was not heard in this: for many
of them beeing entangled with the pleasures of Babylon, neuer returned.</p>
                        <p>5. Wherefore Daniels praier was this rather, that whereas the building of the Temple
and Citie was hindred by Cambyses, it would please God, that the worke might goe
forward, and that the impediments might be remooued, and the enemies of his Church pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented:
herein Daniel was heard: for the present in the one, that the malice of the aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
might be staied, which was the cause of the Angels stay, to bridle the enterprise of the
king of Persia: the other was in due time effected afterward, when the Temple was reedifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vnder <hi>Darius,</hi> and afterward Ezra, and Nehemiah were sent to set the citie in order, and
to finish the building of it. And that this was Daniels request, may be gathered by these
two reasons. 1. Daniel was heard concerning that matter for the which he was in griefe
so many daies: but that is shewed before to haue beene for the hindring of the building of
the Lords house. 2. that which deteined the Angel 21. daies, was to shew the effect of
Daniels prayer: but the busines of Persia staied the Angel, that the enemies of Gods people
should not proceede in their malice: therefore for that Daniel praied.</p>

of Persia.</head>
                        <p>1. Some doe thinke, that this Prince of Persia was an euill angel, and no other but Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan:
this was the opinion of <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostata: and some doe father it also vpon <hi>Hierome,</hi>
as <hi>Rupert. lib. 9. de victor. verb. Dei. Thomas p. 1. qu. 113. Carthusian.</hi> and <hi>Hieromes</hi> words
seeme to import so much: for he thinketh that this Prince of <hi>Persia,</hi> was of those Princes,
whome S. Paul calleth princes of the world, which crucified Christ, 1. Cor. 2. 8. which are
vnderstood to be the euill angels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though indeede in that place S. Paul speaketh of the
Princes and gouernours of the world, which set themselues against Christ. But whether
<hi>Hierome</hi> were or not of that opinion, <hi>Cassianus</hi> euidently saith, <hi>quem principem regni Persa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,
minime dubitandum est adversariam fuisse potestatem, quae favebat genti Persarum
inimicae populo Dei,</hi> which Prince it is not to be doubted but was the aduersarie power
which fauoured the nation of the Persians, which was an enemie to the people of God,
&amp;c. <hi>Cassian. collat. 8. c. 13. Rupertus</hi> also concurreth with him, <hi>prudens auditor principes il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los
angelos malos intelligere non dubitaret,</hi> a discreete hearer will not doubt to vnderstand
by those Princes (of Persia and Grecia) the euill Angels: the euill angel of Persia laboured
to keepe the people in captiuitie, because he was delighted with their afflictions, and would
haue the Persians thereby sinne more grieuously by oppressing the Lords people: the euill
Angel of Grecia laboured for the same reasons, to bring them in captiuitie to the Grecians.
Thus <hi>Hugo Cardinal.</hi> deliuereth <hi>Hieromes</hi> exposition: of the same opinion that this Prince
of Persia was Satan, are <hi>Melancthon, Osiander,</hi> and <hi>Pappus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But thus it may be obiected against this exposition. 1. the euill angels are not able to
resist the good, but the most inferiour of the good angels is of greater power, then the most
mightie of the euill: for as <hi>Thomas</hi> saith,<note place="margin">1. p. qu. 109. art. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

                           <hi>ordo gratiae praeponderat ordini naturae,</hi> the order of
grace preuaileth against the order of nature.</p>
                        <p>To this it is answered, that the euill angels haue not power to resist the good by any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
facultie, but by reason of the sinnes of the Iewes: <hi>malus pugnat accusando, bonus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendendo,</hi>
the euil doth fight in accusing, the good in defending: And <hi>Rupertus</hi> sheweth how
the euill angel withstood the deliuerance of the Iewes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> foure waies. 1. <hi>instigando ad gravissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
scelera,</hi> by prouoking them vnto great sinnes, whereby God should be offended with
them. 2. <hi>exaggerandis bonis, quae in captiuitate possidebant,</hi> by amplifying and setting forth
those good things which they enioyed in Babylon. 3. <hi>alienando animum Cyri,</hi> by alienating
the minde of Cyrus from them. 4. and by accusing them, and presenting their sinnes before
God: so <hi>Rupert. lib. 9. de victor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> verb. c.</hi> 6.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> But it is euident by the text, that no such resisting by perswasion, suggestion, or
seduction is meant, but by a contrarie power and endeauour: because the Angel speaketh of
Michaels ayding and helping him against the Prince of Persia, v. 13. and v. 20. of his figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with the king of Persia. As the angel fighteth against him, so the Prince of Persia resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
the Angel: But he did fight, not by perswasion, or suggestion, but by hindring and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
his enterprises.</p>
                        <p>2. Againe it is obiected, that the euill spirits are not made presidents of nations: as some
imagine, that euery nation and kingdome hath both a good, and euill angel set ouer it: to
this it is answered, that the euill spirits haue not this power giuen them of God ouer nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but they haue it by reason of mens sinnes: and indeede the Persians and Grecians wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
deuills in their idols, and so they themselues made the deuills and euill spirits their
Princes.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> True it is, that the Prince of darknes ruleth in the hearts of the disobedient: but
it is one thing to seduce and entice men vnto sinne, an other to manage the affaires of king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.
This Prince of Persia hindred the building of the Temple, and the returne of the
people. This Satan had no power to doe, otherwise then by his ministers and instruments.
So then the euill spirits, are the Princes of darknes, and of the world of the wicked: but Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of countries and kingdomes they are not. Satan indeede saide vnto Christ, that all the
kingdomes of the world were his, to giue to whome he would, Luk. 4. 6. but therein he
lied: for the earth is the Lords, and all that therein is, Psal. 24. 1.</p>
                        <p>2. An other opinion is, that this Prince of Persia, was a good Angel to whome the care
of that nation was committed: of this opinion are <hi>Gregorie, Theodoret, Thomas, 1. p. q. 123.
ar. 7. Lyranus, Carthusianus,</hi> vpon this place, and <hi>Vatablus</hi> in his annotations, and <hi>Pint<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> so
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:18834:192"/>
also <hi>Oecolampad. Pellic.</hi> And whereas one Angel is said to withstand an other, it is not they
say, so to be vnderstood, as though they did contend, and striue together: but as long as the
will of God is not yet reuealed, the Angels, <hi>populorum, quibus praesunt, diuersa merita expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunt
coram Deo,</hi> doe onely lay open before God, the diuers state and deserts of the people,
ouer whome they are set: <hi>Perer.</hi> yet so reasoning the case, <hi>vt quando revelata fuerit divin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

voluntas, simpliciter concordent,</hi> that after Gods will is reuealed, they simply accord toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<hi>Lyran. Pererius</hi> bringeth in the Angels thus reasoning together: first the Angel of the
Persians thus alleadgeth, that it was not fit for the Iewes to returne, 1. because it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
for them to be vnder affliction; in their prosperitie they would quickly forget God.
2. And their sinnes were so great, that they deserued a longer time of captiuitie then for
70. yeares. 3. And beside, some respect was to be had vnto the Persians, that they by the
Iewes cohabiting among them, might be brought to the knowledge of the true God. On
the other side Gabriel for the Iewes might thus alleadge, 1. that it was requisite they
should now be deliuered as God had promised, seeing the 70. yeares of captiuitie was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined.
2. there was great feare, least, if they should continue longer among the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
Gentiles, they might sooner be peruerted to idolatrie, then the other conuerted to
their religion. 3. And though they were vnworthie in respect of themselues, of this bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
yet the Lord would respect them for the Messiahs sake, that was to come of that nation.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. It is a very base thing to imagine, that there is any such altercation or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute
betweene the good Angels, among whome there is a most sweete concent and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie:
If Satan be not diuided against Satan, Matth. 12. 25, 26. but they worke together to
vphold their kingdome; much more doe the good angels consent together to doe the Lords
will. 2. All the Angels are sent forth to minister for their sakes, that shall be heires of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
Hebr. 1. 14. therefore they will not perswade any thing against the people of God.
3. If they rest contented, when Gods will is knowne, then they would not reason against the
deliuerance of the people of Israel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherein the Lords will &amp; pleasure was reuealed alreadie.</p>
                        <p>3. Therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this Prince of Persia, was none other then Cyrus, or Cambyses in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,

to the Iewes, and false informations giuen in against them, caused them to cease from
building of the Temple: All this was no doubt wrought by the malice of Satan. But Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byses
is this Prince of Persia, who withstood the Angel, not as opposing himselfe, but inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
his authoritie to hinder the worke of Gods house, which the Angel furthered: And

the Angel.</head>
                        <p>1. They which vnderstand the Prince of Persia here spoken of, v. 13. and the Prince of
Grecia, mentioned v. 20. to be euill angels, doe verily thinke that there is striuing and figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
betweene them in deede: as <hi>Cassianus</hi> thus conludeth, <hi>Discordias gentium &amp; conflictus,
quos istis instigantibus inter se gerunt, etiam contra se aduersae exercent potestates,</hi> the discords
and conflicts of the nations, which they make among themselues, by the instigation of these
spirits, euen the aduersarie powers doe exercise among themselues, &amp;c. He thinketh, that by
the variance betweene nations, which is caused by euill spirits, the Deuills themselues may
be thought likewise to be at variance.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Rupertus</hi> goeth further, <hi>Etiam sibimet semper dissentiunt, &amp; inter eos semper sunt iur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,
quia superbi sunt,</hi> the euill Angels doe not onely resist the good, but they are at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
betweene themselues alwaies, and there are continually brawles among them, because
they are proud, &amp;c. But both these opinions are contrarie to that saying of our Sauiour, that
Satan is not diuided against Satan, for then his kingdome could not long stand.</p>
                        <p>3. The euill Angels likewise resist the good, as <hi>Hierome</hi> saith in this place, <hi>enumerando
peccata Iudaeorum,</hi> by rehearsing the sinnes of the people, for the which they were iustly
held in captiuitie: and <hi>Rupertus</hi> sheweth how they contradict the good Angels about our
praier,<note place="margin">lib. 9. de victor. verb. c. 8.</note> 
                           <hi>nostra contra nos declamando causas iniustitiae, &amp;c.</hi> by declaiming against vs, &amp; shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our vnrighteousnes, for the which we deserue not to be heard. But in this sense they
might as well be said to contradict God, and to withstand him, when they seeke to hinder
his gratious will and purpose toward his: and thus the euill angels oppose themselues not
onely 21. daies, but continually, they neuer giue ouer.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="384" facs="tcp:18834:193"/>
4. <hi>Pappus</hi> seemeth to vnderstand this resistance of the Deuill, of his suggestions and
tentations: which he worketh fiue waies: 1. by peruerting the vnderstanding and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and corrupting it with error, as Idolaters, and heretikes are seduced. 2. by incensing
the will and affections to anger, enuie, lust, and such like. 3. by offering the obiects, and
occasions of sinne, as opportunitie of time, person, place. 4. by driuing men to despaire
through aduersitie and affliction. 5. by puffing them vp with prosperitie. But this is not

<hi>who is as God:</hi> whereupon it can not be inferred, that he is not God: for the essence
of the Sonne is not compared with the essence of the Father, but the comparison is of their
persons: and so Christ is called the image of the inuisible God, Coloss. 1. 15. the ingrauen
image of his person, Heb. 1. 3. 2. He is called the cheife of the Angels, who are called Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

<hi>the first,</hi> as <hi>one:</hi> as the word <hi>achath,</hi> of the same sense is taken, Dan. 1. 21. <hi>he was vnto the first

3. This Michael is called the Prince of the people of God, v. 21. who is Christ, and

which must be taken properly, this matter beeing done among the celestiall spirits: Then to
say that Christ is helped and ayded of the Angels, is a verie improper speach, and agreeth not
with the analogie of faith.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Bullinger</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> thinke that although God could haue protected his people by

to testifie his care to his Church, he sendeth an other Angel to helpe: But this is more to the

but euen Michael the Prince of the Angels, the Sonne of God himselfe protecteth them.</p>
                        <p>5. Wherefore it is the sounder opinion, that this Angel was helped, <hi>non accessione nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,

2. the <hi>ordinar. gloss.</hi> which <hi>Hugo Cardinal.</hi> followeth, by the king of Persia vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<hi>Michael:</hi> but the construction of the text will not beare it: for Michael helped him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Prince or king of Persia. 3. <hi>Oecolampad.</hi> referreth it vnto Christ, who is said to
remaine in Persia in his members, that were captiues there, as Paul is said to haue persecuted
Christ in his members: But the text sheweth, that this is giuen as a reason, why the Angel
came no sooner to Daniel, because he remained all that while, and was staied in Persia by
occasion of the businesse, which there fell out: the Angel speaketh then of a personall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
or staying, which could in no wise agree vnto Christ, who was not yet incarnate,
and as he is God he is in euerie place at once. 4. the most, by the kings of Persia, doe vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the Angels which were presidents of Persia, against whom this Angel striued for the
people of God: But <hi>Rupertus</hi> reasoneth against this: because Angels are not called kings of
countreys: and beside he would haue said, be remained against, rather then with those An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
which did contradict him. 5. Therefore <hi>Rupertus,</hi> though by the Prince of Persia be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he vnderstood the euil Angel of Persia, yet here resolueth that by the kings of Persia,
must be vnderstood <hi>Darius</hi> or <hi>Cyrus,</hi> with whom the Angel furthered the businesse, for the
returne of the people: and afterward in the raigne of Assuerus, he preuented the mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
counsell of Haman against the Iewes, and turned it vpon his owne head. And this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
is the right meaning of these words: sauing that the Angel speaketh onely of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
at this time with the kings of Persia, Cambyses and his nobles, or Cyrus and Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byses
rather: not of his remaining there still, as though the charge of that Prouince were
committed still vnto this Angel; for no such thing can be gathered out of the Scripture,
that the nations and kingdomes of the earth are assigned to particular Angels as their presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.</p>

that he to whom Daniel, spake was an other beside him that stood by the riuer, descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:18834:194"/>
v. 4. for this that he here speaketh to, stood before him, v. 16. but the other cloathed
in linen, stood by the riuer, c. 12. 6. Neither is it like that the Angel would haue receiued
this submission of so great a Prophet, seeing he refused it at Iohns hand, Reuel. 22. 8. and
take him as his seruant, whose fellow seruant he was, as the Angel saith to Iohn in that place:
He calleth the Angel afterward Lord, which was an honourable saluation vsed among men,
but seruant he was onely to Iesus Christ.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> taketh this to be Christ, whose seruant Daniel here professeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to be: and he noteth therein the distinction of persons, in that Daniel speaketh to one
present of an other absent, <hi>the seruant of that my Lord.</hi> But he thinketh all this to be vttered
also by Christ, and not by the Angel: whereas it is euident, that many things here spoken in
this conference with Daniel, cannot be vnderstood of Christ: as that he was sent, that he
speaketh of Michael, which was Christ, as an other person beside himselfe, in that he saith,
he was <hi>helped,</hi> and <hi>remained</hi> in Persia: these things cannot agree vnto Christ.</p>
                        <p>3. Wherefore I thinke rather with <hi>Polanus,</hi> that Daniel turning himselfe to the Angel
Gabriel, which was before him, speaketh of Christ, that glorious person which appeared,
v. 4. as may be gathered by the demonstratiue which he vseth: <hi>how can the seruant of that
my Lord, talke with that my Lord,</hi> that is, seeing I am so afraid talking with thee, how should
I be able to endure to talke with yonder my Lord: So it is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that there is an interchange

                        <p>1. Some thinke, that the Angel which appeared at the first in that glorious manner, v. 4.
hath this conference with Daniel: so <hi>Hierome, in hominis figura videtur Angelus, &amp;c.</hi> the
Angel is seene in an humane shape, and stretcheth forth a mans hand vnto Daniel, that he
should not be afraid: So also <hi>Hugo Cardin. Perer. Pintus, Pappus, Bullinger, Calvin,</hi> with

appeared, v. 4.</p>
                        <p>2. Some thinke, that as Christ appeared there, so it was he that had all this conference
with Daniel, and thrice touched him with his hand, so <hi>Oecolamp.</hi> but it is shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
quest. 25. 2. that many things are vttered by the Angel, which can no way agree vnto
Christ.</p>
                        <p>3. Some will haue that to be an Angel, which was seene of Daniel, v. 4. but he that
stretched forth his hand they thinke to be the sonne of God, whose office it is to comfort
and strengthen, <hi>Osiand.</hi> But if that glorious vision should be of an Angel, and the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of a mans hand signified Christ, the minister should haue appeared more gloriously
then the Lord.</p>
                        <p>4. Some thinke that these things were done interchangeably, that some things were
done by the Angel, some by Christ: the touching of him with an hand was Christs action:
but when mention is made of Michael, the angel speaketh: of this opinion seemeth <hi>Iunius</hi>
to be in his commentarie vpon these words, <hi>one like the similitude of the sonne of man, touched
my lippes, personam agentem Christum designari minime dubium est, qui singularia &amp; praeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pua

signified to be the person agent here, who in such kind of reuelations reserueth the most
singular and speciall workes to himselfe, &amp;c. But it was the same person which touched Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,
and strengthened him, and after spake vnto him, as is euident, v. 11. and 19. <hi>let my
Lord speake, for thou hast strengthened me.</hi> Now it is the Angel that spake to Daniel, for he
speaketh of Michael, whom <hi>Iunius</hi> well vnderstandeth here to be Christ, as of an other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
beside himselfe: therefore it was he also, that touched him.</p>
                        <p>5. Wherefore it beeing confessed and graunted, that it was Christ, which appeared, v. 4.
yet the rest is done by an angel, who as <hi>Polanus</hi> well saith, <hi>tanquam Dei administer,</hi> as Gods
minister, on this behalfe doth minister strength vnto Daniel: and this may be made plaine by
these two reasons. 1. because the same person strengtheneth Daniel, and speaketh vnto him
beeing strengthened: as is euident, v. 11. and 19. 2. and the like was done by the Angel
Gabriel before, c. 8. 18. who touched Daniel, and set him vp in his place: And so <hi>Iunius</hi> in
his annotations, thinketh that this was the angel Gabriel that touched Daniel in the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of a man, in v. 16.</p>

one against another, as <hi>Hierome</hi> saith, that the Prince of the Grecians came into Gods
presence, <hi>vt accusaret Persarum principem,</hi> to accuse the Prince of the Persians, that the

                           </gap>his
euil angel of Grecia did not so much set himselfe against the angel of Persia, as against the
people of God, seeking to hold them vnder in captiuitie also vnder the Grecians, <hi>Osiand.
3. Rupertus</hi> likewise vnderstandeth this place of the euill angels, but thus applyeth it, that
they set the Persians and Grecians together by the eares: for about the same time Darius the
3. king of Persia was ouercome of the Grecians, and his sonne Xerxes after him comming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Grecians with an huge armie, was constrained to flee away with shame. 4. <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon</hi>
saith that the good angels did fight against the euill angels of Grecia, which stirred
vp the people of <hi>Ionia,</hi> to rebel in Cyrus time, who were suppressed by <hi>Harpagus.</hi> But all
these are wide: for 1. the euill spirits are not said to be Princes of countreys. 2. neither are
those subtile spirits at variance among themselues. 3. and here the Prince of Grecia is
brought in as assisting the angel against the Prince of Persia: but the euill angels doe not
ioyne with the good.</p>
                        <p>2. Some take these Princes to be good angels: and these also are of diuerse opinions. 1.
Some thinke that the prince of Grecia did fight, that is, the good Angel also of Grecia did
reason the case with Gabriel, that the Hebrewes should not yet be deliuered, and that the
Grecians were more to be respected then they. <hi>Theodoret. 2. Gregorie</hi> giueth an other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
because <hi>Iudaei aliquid in Graecos commiserant,</hi> the Iewes had committed somewhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Grecians, which was obiected by the angel president of Grecia, why they should
not be deliuered, so <hi>Gregor. lib. 17. moral.</hi> c. 8. But the Iewes are not found to haue had
any dealing at all with the Grecians, vntill <hi>Alexanders</hi> time: and the Iewes were deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
out of captiuitie alreadie, therefore that could not now be hindered. 3. Some thinke
that the angel of Grecia expostulated for the wrongs which the Persians had done vnto the
Grecians, <hi>Oecolamp.</hi> 4. Some thinke, that this angel after he had finished his battel with the
Prince of Persia, he was afterward to goe against the Prince of Grecia, <hi>Sa.</hi> But how can it
be imagined, that there should be such expostulating and parts taking among the angels? for
warres and strife doe arise of naturall desires, as S. Iames saith, 4. 1. <hi>From whence are wars
and contentions among you? are they not hence, euen of your lusts, that fight in your members?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Bullinger</hi> thinketh that by the Prince of Grecia may be vnderstood, some man of Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,
that appeared in vision, as approaching vnto God, as by way of aduise or consultation:
But an angel reporteth this, who haue not visions shewed them as men.</p>
                        <p>4. The best sense then is this, that by the Princes of Persia and Grecia, are vnderstood
the kings of the Persians and Grecians, with the one, the Angel himselfe wil encounter now,
and the other, namely the Prince of Grecia, in time to come should be raised vp against him
also. So two things are here declared by the Angel: first that he will goe forth and fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Prince of Persia: for both Cyrus, after the edict for the reedifying of the Temple
was reuersed, prospered not, but was slaine in the Scythian warres: and Cambyses likewise
fell into great enormities: first he caused his owne brother <hi>Tanaoxares</hi> to be killed, beeing
falsely accused by <hi>Sphendadates</hi> the Magician, of some practising against Cambyses: he made
his mother drinke poison, and so die, he killed his owne sister beeing his wife, and great with
child, his wife <hi>Roxane</hi> brought forth a child without an head, which the wisemen interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that he should haue no heire to succeed him in the kingdome: At the last he was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with his owne sword falling out of his sheath, and so died. Secondly, the Prince of Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia
is armed against the Persians: for beside, that many valiant captaines of the Grecians
were raised vp, as <hi>Leonides, Miltiades, Themistocles,</hi> which put the Persians to the soile, in
<hi>Darius Hystaspis,</hi> and <hi>Xerxes</hi> raigne; at the length <hi>Alexander</hi> captaine of the Grecians,
was stirred vp, who ouerthrewe the Persian Monarchie.</p>

                        <head>Quest. 29. In what sense the Angel saith, that none held
with him, but Michael their
Prince.</head>
                        <p>1. They which thinke that this Michael was an Arkangel, doe giue this reason hereof,
why Michael onely ioyned with this Angel, because he had the chiefe charge of the people
and Church of God, vnder Christ, <hi>Genevens.</hi> and to the same purpose, <hi>Lyran. quia princeps
erat totius synagogae generaliter,</hi> because Michael was the generall Prince of the whole syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue
and Church of the Iewes.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Vatablus</hi> vnderstandeth, <hi>in his pugnis,</hi> in these battels against the king of Persia, there
is none that helpeth me but Michael. But neither can it be shewed that one Angel onely
hath the protection of the Church, seeing two armies of Angels attended vpon Iakob, Gen.
32. 1. and when Elisha prayed that the eyes of the young man might be opened, all the
mountaines seemed full of fierie horse and chariots: neither is it like, that the Angels would
withdrawe their helping hand one from another.</p>
                        <p>3. The <hi>gloss.</hi> giueth this reason, that none helped him in presenting their prayers vnto
God, but Michael this Arkangel: But by this reason Christ the Mediator should be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from mediating for them: neither can it be shewed out of Scripture, that the Angels
haue any such office to offer vp mens prayers.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Theodoret</hi> saith, that all the heauenly spirits were in deede against the deliuerance of
the people, <hi>propter multa eorum scelera,</hi> because of their many sinnes: But it is not like this
people beeing so deere vnto God, that the holy Angels would so set against them.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi>Albertus</hi> thinketh that by Michael is not vnderstood onely the person of the Arkan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,
but likewise all the companie of the angels which were vnder him, as Reuel. 12. menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is made of Michael, and his angels, which fought with the dragon, <hi>ex Perer.</hi> But it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident,
that the Angel speaketh onely of this Michaels person, because it is added <hi>your prince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi>
now Michael onely, and not the rest of Angels, was their Prince.</p>
                        <p>6. Some shew this reason, why Michael onely helped the Angel, because he helped Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael,
c. 11. 1. <hi>Oecolamp.</hi> But that place is not vnderstood of helping of Michael, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of protecting the kingdome and Monarchie of Persia.</p>
                        <p>7. <hi>Calvin</hi> thus resolueth, why onely one other angel helped him, and not many: because
God is not to be tied to any certaine meanes, to vse alwayes many Angels, <hi>vt eodem modo
semper nobis succurat,</hi> that he should succour vs alwayes after one manner: But this satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not, for the Lord might haue helped onely with one Angel, and without any at all, if it
had pleased him: therefore yet the reason appeareth not, why this Michael is singled out to
helpe him.</p>
                        <p>8. <hi>Dyonisius</hi> further saith, <hi>lib. de coelest. hierarch. c.</hi> 4. that no Angels doe vndertake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ministerie or seruice, <hi>nisi sibi à Deo iniunctum,</hi> vnlesse it be enioyned them of God: and
therefore these two angels ioyne together, because vnto them onely was committed this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse
of seeing the people deliuered: to the same purpose also, <hi>Osiander.</hi> This is true, but
yet it is not apparant, why this businesse should be committed to Michael, more then to an
other.</p>

9. But this beeing graunted; that this Michael is Christ the sonne of God, as is prooued
before, quest. 22. who is indeede the Prince of the people of God, the reason is euident,
why Michael onely assisteth this angel, because when all other terrene powers doe faile, he
taketh vpon him the defense and protection of his Church, <hi>Iun. Polan. H. Br.</hi>

of heathenish idolatrie: much lesse should we call God, by the names of the Gentiles gods,

their poetrie: for if Christians may name God vnder such names, why might not the Iewes

conuerted, Act. 9. 3. 4. S. Iohn likewise, when Christ appeared vnto him, Rev. 1. 17. Thus
men must be humbled by seeing and acknowledging their owne weaknes, before they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue

Christ dealt with the blind man, Mark. 8. 24, 25. at the first putting on of his hands, he saw

                        <p>1. <hi>Hierome,</hi> who taketh the first words of v. 1. to be vttered by Daniel, that he praied for
the prosperitie of Darius, thinketh that this vision is diuers from the former, for that happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the third yeare of Cyrus, c. 10. 1. this in the 1. of Darius: and so his opinion is, that at
what time Daniel praied for Darius in his first yeare, then these things were reuealed vnto
him by the Angel: and so there is in the text a sudden change of the person: for in the 2. v.
the Angel speaketh, <hi>behold, now I will shew thee:</hi> whereas the former words were vttered by
Daniel. And this he saith is not vnusuall in Scripture, for a person suddenly to be brought in
not mentioned before: as, Psal. 32. v. 7. after Dauid had said, <hi>thou art my secret place,</hi> then v.
8. the Lord is brought in speaking, <hi>I will instruct thee, and teach thee the way that thou shalt
goe, &amp;c.</hi> Of this opinion with <hi>Hierome</hi> are the author of the scholasticall historie, <hi>Albertus,</hi>
and <hi>Carthusian. Hug. Cardin.</hi>

2. But the better opinion is, that this vision conteyned in this chapter, is continued with
the former: which <hi>Lyranus</hi> prooueth, because this chapter beginneth with the Hebrewe

                              </gap>,</hi> which sheweth a coherence with the former. And it may further be thus
confirmed, in the former chapter, v. 14. the Angel saith, <hi>I am come to shewe thee, what shall
come to thy people in the latter dayes:</hi> But these things are not there declared to the Prophet:
the things then which should befall the people of God, which the Angel came to declare to
the people, are those things which are expressed in this chapter.</p>
                        <p>3. Some doe make this verse a part of the former chapter, and will haue this to be the
sense, as Michael helped me, so I againe helped Michael, <hi>Vatab. Bulling.</hi> But it shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
in the 3. question, that the Angel saith not here that he helped or strengthened Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael,
but Darius rather.</p>

                        <head>Quest. 2. v. 1. Who it was that here saith,

                        <p>1. <hi>Hierome,</hi> whose opinion is in part shewed before, thinketh that Daniel speaketh these
words, that he prayed vnto God for Darius, that his kingdome might be confirmed and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished,
who had as much as in him lay, deliuered Daniel from his enemies, and sealed the
stone vpon the mouth of the lions denne, that none of his aduersaries should goe in to hurt
him: But the phrase sheweth, <hi>I stood vp to strengthen him,</hi> that this is not vnderstood of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
or desire to strengthen him, but of a power whereby he was strengthened.</p>
                        <p>2. Some thinke, that these words were vttered by the Lord Iesus Christ, as the former
also in the 10. chapter, <hi>Oecolampad.</hi> But Christ needed not the assistance of any Angel, as
he saith that Michael helped him, v. 13. and Michael which helped the Angel is rather vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
to be Christ, see before, c. 10. quest. 22.</p>
                        <p>3. Therefore this was the Angel Gabriel, who spake before vnto Daniel, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his speach still: for whereas he faith, <hi>I stood vp to strengthen him,</hi> he speaketh not this, as
though he did it by his owne power, but in <hi>Dei persona,</hi> in the person of God, <hi>Calvin.</hi> and
<hi>officium suum solum commemorat,</hi> the Angel sheweth onely his office and ministerie, <hi>Polan.</hi>
he did onely strengthen him, as Gods minister therein.</p>

                        <p>1. <hi>Lyranus</hi> vnderstandeth here Daniel, whom the Angel strengthened in offring vp his
prayers vnto God: that as Daniel prayed for Darius, so the Angel furthered therein Daniels
prayers, <hi>quia efficacior est virtus angeli, quam hominis,</hi> because the strength of an Angel is
greater then of a man: But beside that the Scripture doth not giue any such office vnto the
Angels, to be the presenters of our prayers, the Angel speaketh to Daniel in the second per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
v. 2. <hi>I came to shew thee:</hi> but this speach is vttered in the third person, <hi>I stood vp to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
him.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. Some doe take this to be Michael the Arkeangel, whom this angel strengtheneth,
<hi>Oecolamp. Vatab.</hi> and some make this the sense, that these two Angels ioyned together to
suppresse Sathan, who animated and stirred vp the Persians against the people of God, <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

But in the first of <hi>Darius,</hi> nothing was attempted against the Lords people: all made
for them: for the people then by the ioint edict of Cyrus and Darius, were set free: some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
it thus: that if these two angels Michael and Gabriel were able to assist Darius to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome
the mighty Monarchie of Babylon, much more were they able to preserue the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God now, <hi>Bulling.</hi> This sense is much to the purpose, sauing that he vnderstandeth
Michael here to be an Angel, who is before prooued to be Christ himselfe, c. 10. quest. 22.
who could not be helped by a ministring Angel, beeing the commander and helper of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
himselfe.</p>
                        <p>3. The meaning then is, that the Angl helped Darius to subdue the Monarchie of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon:
and herein is shewed the accomplishment of the vision of the hand, writing the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Balthazar and his kingdome vpon the wall, Dan. 5. which handwriting was made
by the Ministerie of the Angels, who by Gods appointment assisted Darius in the subduing
of the Babylonian state and Monarchie: so in effect the Angel thus reasoneth, that seeing by
their ministerie, the Babylonian Monarchie was ouerthrowne, and the Persian state set vp:
they are as able to bridle the rage and furie of the Persian kings, as they were first to set them

                        <p>These reasons may be yeelded thereof. 1. because that the Empire of the Persians, was

the Grecians, as the kingdome of the Seleucians, and P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

them lightly ouer. 2. And an other reason is, seeing the people were to endure much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
vnder the kings of Syria and Egypt, but especially of Syria, it was requisite, that the
people should be comforted against those times: and therefore the Angel at large declareth
such things, as should befall the people of God, vnder those kings, but chiefely vnder <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus

This opinion may euidently be refelled by Scripture: which maketh mention at the least of
5. kings of Persia: <hi>Pererius</hi> thinketh that sixe are named in Scripture: 1. <hi>Cyrus.</hi> 2. then <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suerus,</hi>

<hi>Darius Hystaspis,</hi> as is shewed before quest. 58. c. 9. 2. he thinketh the Temple beganne

that accused <hi>Tanyoxares Cambyses</hi> brother, whom <hi>Cambyses</hi> caused to be taken out of the
way by giuing him bulls blood to drinke, and then this <hi>Sphendadates</hi> was taken for <hi>Camby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
brother, and <hi>Cambyses</hi> beeing dead he vsurped the kingdome: But he beeing discouered
by <hi>Tibethes</hi> Eunuch vnto <hi>Amytis, Cambyses</hi> mother, the 7. gouernours of Persia conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to kill him, and then Darius Hystaspis was elected king, because he procured by art his
horse first to neigh at the rising of the Sunne, (whom the Persians worship as their God) as
was agreed betweene them before. Beside, as this <hi>Sphendadates</hi> was an vsurper, so he raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
onely 7. moneths, as <hi>Herodotus,</hi> therefore in both these respects, because he was an v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surper,

<hi>Darius</hi> the fourth, whom Alexander ouercame: But it is prooued before quest. 5. that the

                        <head>Quest. 7. Of the fourth king of Persia his riches
and power.</head>
                        <p>Two things are here expressed concerning this fourth king, 1. that he should be richer
then they all: for beside the great summes of treasure which <hi>Darius Xerxes</hi> father had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
together, he was 6. yeares after in making preparation for the warres of Grecia: and
beeing thus growne to exceeding great riches, then he beganne these wars against the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,
which though intermitted a while, yet were not fully ended vntill the Monarchie of
the Persians was finally ouerthrowne by the power of Grecia vnder <hi>Alexander.</hi> 2. it is
said, <hi>he should raise all against the realme of Grecia;</hi> herein three things are to be considered:
1. the preparation to this warre. 2. the successe thereof. 3. the ende of this rich king. First
his preparation was wonderfull, <hi>Polanus</hi> out of <hi>Ctesias</hi> saith his armie consisted of 800.
thousand men, and a thousand shippes. <hi>Calvine</hi> reckoneth 900. thousand: <hi>Osiander</hi> out
of Iostine counteth a 1000. thousand men, and a 1000. thousand shippes: but <hi>Herodotus</hi>
goeth yet further, and maketh the whole summe 23. hundred thousand. <hi>Pererius</hi> excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
them all, collecting that the whole armie, <hi>quinquies continebat decies centena millia,</hi>
conteined 5. times 10. hundred thousand. But this number seemeth to be incredible: yet
without question he prouided an huge armie, in so much that it is said, he drunke vp riuers,
made bridges ouer the Sea, cast downe huge mountaines, and made them euen with the
ground. 2. now for his successe, he was ouercome in 4. battells, and within the space of
two yeares, all this huge companie was vanquished and destroyed: first, he was foyled at
<hi>Thermopilae,</hi> where 300. Lacedemonians discomfited the whole armie of the Persians: then
he was ouercome by Sea at <hi>Artemisium,</hi> afterward at <hi>Salamine,</hi> where finding the bridge
broken downe, he was constrained to flie away in a small boate: lastly <hi>Mardonius,</hi> by whose
counsell he tooke that warre in hand, was vanquished at <hi>Plateae;</hi> And such was the successe
of that warre. 3. Now the ende of <hi>Xerxes</hi> was this, at his returne he fell into inordinate
lust and cruelty: he committed incest with his brothers wife, and daughter, and caused his
owne brother <hi>Masistes</hi> to be slaine, and he himselfe was killed by <hi>Artabanus,</hi> who a while
vsurped the kingdome after him: And this was the ende of this rich and mightie king of
Persia.</p>

                        <head>Quest. 8. Why the Angel leaueth at the fourth king of Persia, seeing
there were more.</head>
                        <p>1. <hi>Lyranus</hi> his opinon here is not sound, that thinketh, following the Hebrewes, that
none of the Persian kings are here omitted: and taketh this fourth king to be the last Darius,
that was ouercome by Alexander: but both the continuance of the Persian Monarchie, and
the number of the Persian kings agreed vpon almost by all historians, ouerthroweth this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.
2. yet although there were more kings of Persia then sowre, diuerse reasons may be
alleadged, why the Angel staieth at the fourth and proceedeth no further. 1. the spirit of
God intended not to followe the order of the historie, <hi>sed praeclara quaeque praestringere,</hi> but
to touch onely the principall and speciall things, <hi>Hierome, Hugo Card. 2. Theodoret</hi> saith
the reason is, because the Angel would onely set downe the most mightie kings of Persia,
omitting the rest: and to the same purpose <hi>Bullinger</hi> and <hi>Polanus,</hi> because it is said, <hi>there
shall stand vp three kings of Persia:</hi> the Angel onely speaketh of the flourishing state of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap> at
Empire, before it beganne to decay, as it did presently after Xerxes time. 3. Some giue this
reason, that the other kings of Persia are omitted here, because they are supplied out of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bookes of the Scripture, as of Ezra, Nehemiah, and some of the Prophets, <hi>Pappus.</hi>
4. <hi>Iunius</hi> addeth, because the historie of the Persian kings following concerned not the
people of God: their chiefe businesse afterward fell out with the Grecians, <hi>in commentar.</hi>
5. But the most speciall reason is, the Angel onely nameth those kings by whom the Iewes
were held in captiuitie: and such as hindered the worke of the Temple; and as <hi>Oecolampad.</hi>
out of <hi>Eudoxius,</hi> their gouernements are spoken of, in which there was <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, the
hinderance of the worke, and staying of the building of the Temple, which the Prophet
tooke greatest care and thought for: to the same purpose <hi>M. Calvin.</hi> by <hi>standing,</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth
those kings, which stood against the people of God. 6. Adde hereunto that the
Prophet maketh a cursary mention of them, to insinuate in what short time these foure kings
should runne out the race of their kingdome; for first <hi>Cyrus,</hi> in whose third the Temple was
hindered, raigned not long after: some thinke that Cyrus going against a people of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
called <hi>Derbices,</hi> which vsed to deuoure their parents when they were old, thinking it
a more honourable ende for them, then to be eaten of wormes, fell from his horse, and then
was wounded in the thigh by a dart cast at him by an Indian, and so died, <hi>Polan, ex Cresia.</hi>
but the more receiued opinion is out of <hi>Herodotus,</hi> that he was slaine of Queene <hi>Tomyris,</hi>
and his head beeing cut off was cast into a bowle of blood: yet <hi>Xe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ophon</hi> writeth that Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus
beeing aged died in his bed, giuing fatherly and graue exhortations to his sonnes. After
him Cambyses hauing raigned not much aboue 6. yeares, was wounded by his owne sword,
and so died: <hi>Darius Hystaspis,</hi> beeing 20. yeares old when Cyrus went against Queene
<hi>Tomyris,</hi> and liuing but 43. yeares in all, enioyed not his kingdome 36. yeares, as most thinke,
nor yet halfe so much: <hi>Xerxes</hi> time could not be long: <hi>H. Br.</hi> giueth but 31. yeares to the
Persian Monarchie vnto the second of <hi>Darius Longimanus,</hi> and maketh the 49. yeares, for
the reedifying of the Temple, to coucurre with the 20. of <hi>Darius Longimanus,</hi> whom he
supposeth raigning at home, while his father <hi>Xerxes</hi> was occupied in the Greeke warres,
beeing but then a young man, to haue giuen libertie in his 2. yeare for the reedifying of the
Temple: but if 30. yeares be onely allowed for the raigne of Cyrus, Cambyses, Darius, and
Xerxes, <hi>Darius Longimanus</hi> cannot be thought to be then of yeares to haue sonnes, as he
had, Ezra. 6. 10. But allowe 49. yeares vnto the 2. of Darius, as is further prooued, c. 9.
quest. 58. this was but a short time for the raigne of fowre such potent kings.</p>
                        <p>7. This also beeing ioyned to the former may make the former reasons more full, why
the Angel endeth it at Xerxes, and so passeth vnto Alexanders time, because then the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
begunne betweene the Persians and the Grecians, which was neuer laid downe, till the
Grecians had ouerthrowne the Persian Monarchie. And so <hi>Alexander</hi> in an epistle to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius
Codomannus,</hi> as <hi>Arrianus</hi> writeth, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. pretendeth this as the cause of his warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Persians: <hi>Maitores vestri Mecedoniam ingressi, &amp;c. Your Auncestors invaded Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia,

wherefore I beeing created Emperour of the Grecians, beeing willing to reuenge their wrongs,

                        <p>The Angel briefely toucheth both the rising vp and the fall of Alexanders kingdome. 1.
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:18834:201"/>
the rising of his kingdome is described, by two adiuncts. 1. he shall be mightie: for with
30. thousand footemen, and 5. thousand horsemen, he tooke vpon him to conquer the
whole world. 2. and it is said he shall stand vp: whereby is noted the suddennesse of his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
and the singular dexteritie that was in him to atchieue that which he intended and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed:
the effects are likewise two, 1. <hi>he shall rule with great dominion:</hi> his Empire was large,
for beside other countreys, which he subdued, he possessed all the great Monarchie of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia.
2. <hi>he shall doc according to his pleasure,</hi> he shall be prosperous in all his enterprises, and
preuaile in his warres, according to his owne desires.</p>
                        <p>2. The fall and ruine of his kingdome is likewise described, first in generall, then in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.
1. In generall both by the circumstance of time, <hi>when he shall stand vp,</hi> that is, after
he hath stood a short time: for not aboue seuen yeares had <hi>Alexander</hi> raigned, when his
kingdome, together with his life was dissolued, <hi>Iun. commentar.</hi> and euen when his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
was come to the height, and he expected embassadours at Babylon from al the world,
he died at Babylon: As also the manner is shewed, by a Metaphor, it shall be broken, like
as when a brittle thing is broken into many peices and shiuers.</p>
                        <p>2. In particular two things are expressed, the subiect of this kingdome, and the qualitie
and condition of it. 1. the subiect is declared <hi>affirmatiuely,</hi> it shall be diuided into the 4.
winds, that is to fowre kings and chiefe gouernours, <hi>negatiuely,</hi> not to any of his posteritie,
which is amplified by a Metaphoricall speach, it shall be pulled vp, as a thing by the rootes,
in respect of his owne succession: and others shall be planted in their stead, in the place of
his successors: for so is the meaning of those words, <hi>to others beside those,</hi> that is, it shall be
giuen vnto those fowre successor, of <hi>Alexander,</hi> beside his owne heires.</p>
                        <p>2. For the qualitie of these kingdomes, they shall not be like in power vnto <hi>Alexanders.</hi>
as it is said, <hi>not according to his dominion.</hi>

                        <head>Quest. 10. Of Alexanders birth, and education, acts and life, ende
and death abriged.</head>
                        <p>1. For the first, <hi>Philip</hi> king of Macedonia, was father to Alexander, and his mothers
name was <hi>Olympias:</hi> he was borne about the 2. yeare of the 106. Olympiad: the same day,
wherein he was borne, the great Temple of Diana at Ephesus was set on fire, which the
Magicians interpreted to signifie, that one was then borne, who should set all Asia on fire:
at 15. yeares of age he was committed to <hi>Aristotle</hi> to be instructed, and in his youth was
of such magnanimitie, that when his father had conquered any citie he would say, that his
father would leaue nothing for him to winne.</p>
                        <p>2. At 20. yeares of age he sit vpon the conquest of all the world: in his acts and life three
things are memorable, his vertues, his monuments and exploits, his notable vices. 1. his
vertues may be thus diuided, into his morall, and militarie vertues: As his morall were these,
his <hi>continencie,</hi> before he tasted of the pleasures of Asia: he preserued the chastitie of Dari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
beautifull wife and daughters, and would not so much as see them: his <hi>clemencie</hi> and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie
was great euen towad his enemies: but his <hi>liberalitie</hi> exceeded all the rest: he gaue
23. thousand talents among his souldiers: see more of his vertues, c. 2. quest. 48.</p>
                        <p>His militarie vertues were excellent. 1. his courage, that with 30. thousand footemen,
and 5. thousand horsemen durst aduenture to bid battell to the whole world. 2. his patient
labour in enduring hunger and thirst, frost and cold. 3. his dexteritie and celeritie in omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
no opportunitie. 4. and hereunto may be added his singular successe, he neuer besie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
any citie but he tooke it.</p>
                        <p>2. His exploits were singular. 1. he enlarged the Empire of the Grecians, and made
them Lords of the whole world. 2. he built many cities 70. in number as <hi>Plutarch</hi> writeth,
whereof <hi>Alexandria</hi> in Egypt was one. 3. he reduced many barbarous nations from their
sauage and brui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>3. And his vices which he fell into after he had glutted himselfe with the pleasures of
Asia, were not inferiour to his vertues: fowre notable vices among the rest raigned in him.
1. drunkennesse, he would drinke so excessiuely, that he would lie 2. or 3. dayes till he had

deare friend <hi>Clitus,</hi> much lamenting his death afterward. 3. he was giuen to the wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and pleasure of the flesh. 4. And at length he grewe so intolerable proud, that he
made himselfe Iupiters sonne, for which cause he commanded <hi>Calisthenes</hi> to be killed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he refused to worship him: see before, c. 8. quest. 16.</p>

3. Then Alexanders ende was this, in the 32. yeare of his age he died at Babylon. some
thinke of poison: but he died rather of surfetting and drunkennesse, continuing quaffing so
long, at a Phisitians house a Thessalian, that he fell into a burning feuer, at such time, as
he expected embassadors from the remote countreys of the world, out of Africa, Europa, as
out of Spaine, and Italie, and so in fewe dayes after he sickened, he died, hauing no time to

                        <head>Quest. 11. Of the fowre successors of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander.</head>
                        <p>Concerning three of Alexanders successors there is no question: <hi>Ptolomeus</hi> the sonne of
<hi>Lagus</hi> possessed Egypt the kingdome of the South: <hi>Seleucus</hi> raigned in Syria and Babylon,
in the East, which in respect of Iudea was counted the North: and <hi>Antigonus</hi> held <hi>Asia
minor</hi> in respect of Egypt on the North: but there is some question, who was <hi>Alexanders</hi>
successor in the kingdome of Macedonia in the West.</p>
                        <p>1. The receiued opinion is, that <hi>Arideus</hi> called <hi>Philippus</hi> the brother of <hi>Alexander</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
in the Macedonian kingdome, as <hi>Hierome, Lyranus, Hugo Card. Pintus, Bullinger.</hi>
But <hi>Arideus</hi> cannot properly be counted <hi>Alexanders</hi> successor, because he was but chosen
king for a time vntill <hi>Alexanders</hi> sonnes came to age: and he had but the name of a king:
<hi>Perdiccas</hi> was chosen Tutor and protector of the Empire, and Seleucus master of the horse,
which was the second place in dignitie: <hi>Craterus Treasurer, Antipater</hi> gouernour of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia
and Grecia: and beside the text saith, that the kingdome should not be left to any of
<hi>Alexanders posteritie,</hi> that is, heires or kinred: But his brother was one of his posteritie
and kinred.</p>
                        <p>2. An other opinion is, that <hi>Antipater</hi> one of Alexanders chiefe captaines succeeded
in Macedonia, <hi>Osiand.</hi> but this can not be neither: for though <hi>Antipater</hi> were set ouer Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia,
as other of Alexanders captaines were appointed their seuerall regiments, before
the kingdome was shared and diuided into foure parts; yet because <hi>Aridaeus</hi> was then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
to whome by generall consent of the captaines, the name and title of the king was

                        <p>3. Wherefore <hi>Cassander</hi> rather the sonne of Antipater, who vsurped the kingdome of
Macedonia, as soone as <hi>Aridaeus</hi> was dead, is rather held to be one of the foure successors in
the kingdome, <hi>Iun. Polan. Calv. Pap. Calvin</hi> thinketh that <hi>Cassander</hi> was <hi>Antipaters</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
true it is that he had two sonnes, <hi>Antipater</hi> and <hi>Alexander;</hi> but they by mutuall parri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide
made an ende one of an other, and held not the kingdome long after their father: But
<hi>Cassander</hi> which raigned 18. or 19. yeares ouer <hi>Macedonia,</hi> was the sonne also of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pater.</hi>

fowre parts, and to none other: not the latter, because that falling away of the Parthians
was well nie an 100. yeares after Alexanders death, in the time of Seleucus grandchild to

feuerall diuisions. 2. of their ciuill warres, which they made one with an other. 3. of their
bloodie endes.</p>
                        <p>1. After that Alexanders captaines had by a generall consent chosen officers for the
whole kingdome, <hi>Arideus</hi> was appointed Viceroy during the nonage of Alexanders chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
<hi>Perdiccas,</hi> protectour, whome Antipater afterward succeeded in that place: <hi>Seleucus</hi>
generall for the armie: <hi>Craterus</hi> Treasurer: then they sorted the seuerall Prouinces among
them: Ptolomeus had Egypt, Laomedon Syria, Philotas Cilicia, Antigonus Lycia, Pamphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,
and Prygia the greater, Cassander Caria, Menander Lydia, Leonatus Phrygia the lesse:
Eumenes Cappadoeia and Paphlagonia, Phiton Media. <hi>ex Curtio.</hi> Lysimachus Thracia, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipater

                           </gap>edonia. <hi>H. Br.</hi> And <hi>Iustinus</hi> maketh mention beside of others: to Nicanor cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Seleucus, were committed the Parthians, to Amyntas the Bactrians, to Neoptolemus
the Persians, to Peucestes the Babylonians, to Philippus the Hircanians. And the other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces
remained vnder their gouernment, which held them Alexander yet liuing. Thus A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexanders
Empire beeing distributed among so many petie gouerners, 15. or 16. in all, could
not long so continue vnder so many masters, but they presently fel at variance among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
And in this respect <hi>Demades</hi> wittily compared Alexanders armie when he was dead,
to Cyclops the huge gyant when he had lost his eye: for as that huge bodie wanting light
to direct it, hit here and there, and could not guide it selfe: so this vnruly companie wanting
a guide, dashed one vpon an other, as a shippe without a pilote runneth vpon the rocks and
sands.</p>
                        <p>2. We are in the next place then briefly to see the ciuill dissention and warres which
were mooued among these captaines.</p>
                        <p>1. The first warre was begunne thorough the ambition of <hi>Perdiccas,</hi> who beeing in
greater authoritie then the rest, intended to marrie <hi>Cleopatra</hi> Alexanders sister, and so to
take vpon him the gouernement: which his purpose that he might the better atchieue, he
first enterpriseth to remooue the lettes and impediments: and sendeth Eumenes against
Antipater, and Antigonus, and he himselfe goeth against Ptolome into Egypt: but he was
slaine of his owne souldiers: and not long after Alcetas his brother, and his sister were slaine
also: and this was his ende, who was the first beginner of sedition.</p>
                        <p>2. After this a second stirre beganne betweene Eumenes, and Antigonus: in which bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:18834:203"/>
Neoptolemus and Craterus were slaine, and Eumenes was betraied by his souldiers vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Antigonus, whome he killed.</p>
                        <p>3. Then <hi>Cassander</hi> after he had most treacherously extinguished Alexanders familie,
quarrelleth with Antigonus, from whome he would haue taken certaine cities in Asia, and
ioyneth with Ptolome, and Seleucus, who feared Antigonus greatnes: but Antigonus van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisheth
Cassander, and maketh him to restore the cities in Asia.</p>
                        <p>4. After this Antigonus setteth vpon Seleucus, and Ptolome: but first he was ouercome
by Ptolome at Tyrus, who tooke Demetrius Antigonus sonnes pauilion, with all the prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
furniture, but restored it againe: afterward Demetrius surprized <hi>Cilles</hi> one of Ptolomes
captaines, and 8000. men, but returned them safe to Ptolome, to requite his former huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
and kindnes.</p>
                        <p>5. Then followed a soare battell betweene all of the chiefe captaines remaining, not
farre from Ephesus: on the one side were Seleucus and his sonne Antiochus, Lysimachus,
and Ptolomes forces: on the other Antigonus: the night before the battel, Antigonus had
a vision, wherein Alexander appeared, saying vnto him, that now he would goe vnto his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies:
whereby Antigonus vnderstood, that hauing beene hitherto victorious, he should
be ouercome now: And so it fell out, for as he pursued Antiochus in battell, he was slaine by
Seleucus horsemen, beeing almost 80. yeare old: his sonne fledde to Athens, and renewed
the warre, but he was taken by Seleucus, and long suruiued not his father: then the rest di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
the kingdome of Antigonus among them.</p>
                        <p>6. The last battell betweene Alexanders captaines, was betweene <hi>Lysimachus</hi> and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leucus.</hi>
This Lysimachus was a man of valour: for beeing familiar with Callisthenes, whome
Alexander killed, he was commanded to be cast vnto the lyons: but he killed the lyon, and
so escaped: for which his valour he was afterward much made of by Alexander. But this
Lysimachus among his vertues, had enormous vices: he married two sisters, and had
children by them both, but the one killed the others child: the mother for succour fledde
vnto the other kings allied vnto her: hereupon beganne the quarrell betweene Lysimachus
and Seleucus: but Lysimachus beeing ouercome, was slaine. <hi>Melancth. ex Pausan.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. In the last place let vs take a view of their bloodie endes. <hi>Perdiccas</hi> first killed Melea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:
Ptolome killeth <hi>Cleomenes</hi> Perdiccas friend: and Perdiccas himselfe is slaine of his
owne souldiers, going against Ptolome. <hi>Craterus</hi> and <hi>Neoptolemus</hi> are slaine in battell:
Philotas killeth Phiton: and he with <hi>Eumenes</hi> are slaine by Antigonus: <hi>Antigonus</hi> fighting
against Seleucus is killed: Lysimachus by <hi>Seleucus,</hi> Seleucus is slaine by Ptolome Cerau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
brother to Ptolome Philadelphus then raigning in Egypt: and the same <hi>Ceraunus</hi> not
long after was slaine by Brennus: Demetrius Antigonus sonne rooteth out the house of
Cassander: and so he and his posteritie held the kingdome of Macedonia, vntill the Romans
possessed it. And this was the ende of Alexanders captaines.</p>

onely of the king of the South, and of the
North, omitting the
the rest.</head>
                        <p>Two reasons may be yeelded hereof. 1. The other kingdomes, the one of Asia the lesse
in the North to Egypt, which fell vnto Antigonus, after he was slaine and vanquished by
Seleucus, was diuided among the other captaines, and so it was extinguished: and the other
kingdome of Macedonia in the West, was translated from Cassander and his posteritie, vnto
Demetrius the sonne of Antigonus: neither was it in power answerable vnto the other
two kingdomes, of Syria, and Egypt: and therefore these onely are mentioned: for vers. 5.
the Angel speaketh onely of two mightie kingdomes, which should preuaile aboue the
rest.</p>
                        <p>2. An other reason is, Iudea stood in the middes betweene these two kingdomes of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria
and Egypt, by which occasion, these kings waging battell one against an other, <hi>Iudea</hi>
beeing in the middes, went to wracke betweene them: <hi>Melancthon.</hi> And sometime the
Iewes fauoured one, and sometime an other, and then the aduersarie part still afflicted
them: and thus betweene these two kings were the Iewes molested the space of three
hundred yeares. <hi>Lyranus.</hi> And a third cause there was of trouble vnto the Iewes: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
the Ptolomies of Egypt challenged the gouernment and soueraigntie of Iudea, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:18834:203"/>
the kings of Syria: but in the last sociall warre against Antigonus it was agreed, that
the most part of Iudea should belong vnto the Seleucians, as Antiochus the great allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
in an embassage sent vnto Ptolome Philopator king of Egypt: <hi>Polyb. lib.</hi> 5. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mention is made onely of these two kings, because they onely had to doe with the
people of God: and as <hi>Hierome</hi> saith, <hi>scripturae propositum est, non externam absque Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dais
historiam texere,</hi> it is the intent and purpose of the Scripture, not to follow a forren hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie
without respect vnto the Iewes. And <hi>Iosephus</hi> hereof thus writeth, <hi>Antiocho magno
in Asia regnante, &amp;c. While Antiochus the great raigned in Asia, Iudea was continually
troubled and Coelesyria: for while he had warre with</hi> Ptolomeus Philopator, <hi>and his sonne E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphanes,
whether he did ouercome, or were ouercome, they went to wracke, euen like vnto a

from Babylon which Cambyses had carried away.</p>
                        <p>4. Ptolomeus <hi>Philopator,</hi> so called by the contrarie, for he killed his father, mother, and

sonnes: as Dauids sonnes are said to be his chiefe Princes, 2. Sam. 8. And they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Princes, rather then sonnes, because they were not the legitimate sonnes of Ptolome.
And beside this philadelphus, after the manner of the Persians, married his owne sister <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinoe,</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>But the words of the text following, <hi>he shall preuaile aboue him,</hi> (or, as some read) <hi>against

be the greater: but this was not betweene the father and the sonne: rather Ptolome the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

kingdome, and as <hi>Iustine</hi> saith, resigned vnto him the kingdome beeing yet aliue, thinking
it to be a greater honour to be a kings father, then the king: neither can it be shewed, that
this Ptolome more enlarged the kingdome, then his father had done.</p>
                        <p>3. Therefore, by <hi>one of his Princes,</hi> is rather to be vnderstood, one of <hi>his,</hi> that is, Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders

was North to Iudea: so <hi>Melanct. Vatabl. Calvin, Osiand. Bulling. Genevens. B. Polanus.</hi> 1.
This <hi>Seleucus</hi> was of such strength, that when a wilde bull, as Alexander was sacrificing,
brake loose, he held him by the hornes alone and staied him, whereupon he gaue the hornes
in his armes: which doth fitly answer vnto the description of the fourth beast with tenne
hornes, c. 7. 8. which signified the kingdome of the Seleucians, <hi>Appian. in Syriac.</hi> it is said,
that Seleucus and his posteritie had naturally the signe of an anchor in their thigh, <hi>Melanct.</hi>
2. This Seleucus ouercame Antigonus, though he were before by him expelled out of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon:
and he diuided his kingdome: likewise he caused his sonne Demetrius to yeeld him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
vnto him: he also slue valourous Lysimachus, who in Alexanders time, being cast vnto a
lyon, slue him. 3. He much enlarged his kingdome: he raigned ouer Babylon, and Media,
Mesopotamia, Armenia, Cappadocia: and ouer the Persians, Parthians, Arabians, Bactrians,
Hyrcanians: and possessed all from the borders of Phrygia euen vnto the riuer Indus: and
passing ouer that riuer, he likewise warred with <hi>Sandracotus</hi> king of the Indians: neuer any
possessed more countries in Asia then this Seleucus, onely Alexander excepted. <hi>Polan.</hi> 4.
He builded many goodly cities, sixteene of them he called after his fathers name <hi>Antiochia,</hi>
sixe by his mothers name <hi>Laodicea,</hi> nine after his owne name, <hi>Seleucia:</hi> three by his wiues
name <hi>Apamea,</hi> and one <hi>Stratonica</hi> by his other wiues name: the most famous of these cities,

                        <p>That Ezekiel, c. 38. and Daniel here agree in their description of the same kingdome, may
appeare by these reasons. 1. because the kingdome of Gog is also there called the kingdome

those countries, and the calling of them by the names of the Seleucians, and their

<pb n="408" facs="tcp:18834:205"/>
we neede seeke no further for that great Gog, whome Ezekiel speaketh of. 4. And further,
as Ezekiel prophesieth, c. 38. 23. that after the ouerthrow of Gog, the Lord would be mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
and sanctified among many nations, which was performed by the comming of the

<hi>Seleucus,</hi> and married his fathers wife <hi>Stratonica,</hi> by the aduise of Erasistratus his
Physitian, by whome he had issue Antiochus Theos: <hi>Megas</hi> the brother of <hi>Philadelphus</hi>
king of Egypt, married a daughter of this <hi>Soter,</hi> by which occasion <hi>Megas</hi> claiming to be
king of Cyrene, which his father made him gouernour of, was aided by his father in law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Philadelphus,</hi> and so the truce was broken.</p>
                        <p>2. Then <hi>Philadelphus</hi> to accord this dissention, giueth his daughter <hi>Berenice</hi> to wife to
Antiochus surnamed Theos, the sonne of Soter: and Philadelphus accompanied her vnto
Pelusium, giuing vnto her a rich dowrie of siluer and gold, whereupon she was called <hi>Pher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophoras,</hi>
of her great dowrie.</p>
                        <p>3. But this coniunction did not long hold: for Antiochus Theos had a former wife La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odice,
by whome he had two sonnes, <hi>Seleucus Callinicus,</hi> and <hi>Antiochus Hierax:</hi> whome he
did repudiate, and tooke <hi>Berenice</hi> to wife, by whome he had a sonne. But not long after La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odice

of her husband, poisoned him: and her sonne Callinicus tooke Berenice, and her sonne, and

the kings of the North and South. <hi>Appianus in Syriac.</hi> thinketh that these were two si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,

                        <p>4. Thus haue we the meaning of these words, <hi>shee shall not reteine the power of the arme:</hi>
shee, namely <hi>Berenice,</hi> should not long continue in grace and fauour with Antiochus, who
was as an arme to embrace the two kings together: <hi>neither should be continue and his arme:</hi>

Egypt 14. thousand and eight hundred talents of siluer, and 15. thousand measures of

                        <p>1. <hi>Theodoret</hi> giueth this interpretation here: these warres here prophecied of he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth
of the warres betweene <hi>Ptolomeus Philopator</hi> and <hi>Antiochus</hi> the great: by one of
his captaines before spoken of, v. 6. he would haue vnderstood <hi>Scopas</hi> generall of <hi>Philopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi>
armie, who wunne diuerse places out of <hi>Antiochus</hi> iurisdiction, and ioyned them to his
kingdome: After this <hi>Ptolome</hi> gaue his daughter in mariage vnto <hi>Antiochus:</hi> but she was
returned home againe: yet there came a bud of her, she had a sonne that became an enemie
vnto her father.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> This exposition cannot stand. 1. the warres betweene <hi>Antiochus</hi> the great, and
<hi>Philopator</hi> are afterward spoken of in this chapter. 2. It is vnlike that one of his captaines
should be said to be greater then the king himselfe: seeing all his endeauour was to aduance
the honour and dominion of the king. 3. neither did the king of Egypt giue his daughter
to <hi>Antiochus</hi> the great: but he gaue his daughter <hi>Cleopatra</hi> in mariage to <hi>Ptolome Epiphanes.</hi>
4. beside this bud here spoken of inuadeth the kingdome of the North, whereas <hi>Theodoret</hi>
vnderstandeth this bud to rise vp an enemie to the king of the South.</p>
                        <p>2. This then is the true interpretation. 1. This bud of her, that is, <hi>Berenices</hi> rootes, was
<hi>Ptolome</hi> surnamed <hi>Euergetes,</hi> her naturall and Germane brother: who rose vp to reuenge his
sisters death. 2. He came with an armie and invaded Syria, and wunne the strong holds:
many cities abhorring the cruell fact and parricide of <hi>Callinicus</hi> reuolted, and submitted
themselues to <hi>Ptolome:</hi> who tooke possession of the countrey, and caused himselfe to be
crowned king. 3. but hearing of some commotion in Egypt, he returned, and carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with him many nobles captiues, and a verie great spoile beside, 40. thousand talents of
gold, and many pretious vessels, and 2500. images of their gods, and among them those,
which Cambyses before had carried out of Egypt, whereupon the superstitious Egyptians
called him <hi>Euergetes,</hi> benefactor, <hi>Hierome.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. After <hi>Ptolome</hi> was returned, <hi>Seleucus</hi> prepared a great nauie, which was ouerwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in the Sea, and he himselfe hardly escaped with a fewe of his companie, hauing nothing
left of all that great preparation: in so much that his case was pitied of those which before
had reuolted from him: Then he craued aid of <hi>Antiochus. Hierax</hi> his brother, which <hi>Ptolome</hi>
perceiuing, made peace with Seleucus for 10. yeares, <hi>Oecol. Melanct. ex Iustin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Hierax</hi> seeing this, then turneth his force against his brother Seleucus: which warre
tended to the ruine and destruction of them both: for <hi>Hierax</hi> was slaine of certaine robbers
and theeues, and Seleucus died of a fall from his horse.</p>
                        <p>5. All this beeing thus reported by forren writers, <hi>Iustin. lib. 27. Polybius lib.</hi> 5. agreeth
with this prophesie of Daniel, both of the preparation and expedition of <hi>Ptolome Euergetes</hi>
against <hi>Callinicus, v.</hi> 7. his successe in carrying away much spoile and captiues, v. 8. and his
returne into his countrey, v. 9.</p>
                        <p>6. But where it is said, v. 8. he shall continue more yeares then the king of the North:

and the king of the North, v. 10. 11. 12.</head>
                        <p>This battell is described in three parts. 1. the preparation made by the king of the North,
and their diuerse attempts, v. 10. 2. the resistance made by the king of the South, with
his good successe, v. 11. 3. the euents, that followed vpon this victorie, v. 12.</p>
                        <p>1. The attempts made, are either ioyntly by the two sonnes of <hi>Seleucus Callinicus,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Seleucus Ceraunus,</hi> and <hi>Antiochus</hi> surnamed <hi>Megas</hi> the great: in these words, <hi>his sonnes

onely in the latter part of the verse.</p>
                        <p>First, <hi>Ceraunus</hi> and <hi>Megas</hi> ioyning together, partly to reuenge their father <hi>Callinicus,</hi>
and their grandmother <hi>Laodices</hi> death, partly in hope to recouer Syria, out of <hi>Ptolome
Philopators</hi> hand, who succeeded <hi>Euergetes,</hi> whom some thinke he killed, and therefore was
called <hi>Philopator,</hi> that is, a louer of his father, by the contrarie: they first set vpon Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
captaines, which held Syria for <hi>Philopator:</hi> But <hi>Cerannus</hi> passing ouer the mount Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,
to goe against <hi>Attalus,</hi> who possessed the countrey beyond Taurus, was slaine by the
treason of <hi>Apaturius</hi> and <hi>Nicanor,</hi> in the 2. or 3. yeare of his raigne: of whom <hi>Acheus</hi>
that went with Seleucus beeing his kinsman was presently reuenged, and put them to the
sword, <hi>Polybius lib.</hi> 4. all this agreeth well with this prophecie, sauing that <hi>Polybius</hi> writeth
that <hi>Acheus</hi> went in this battell with Seleucus, and that Antiochus the great liued as yet a

                        <p>Now then Seleucus beeing dead, <hi>Antiochus Megas</hi> taketh vpon him the kingdome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then, as <hi>Polybius</hi> writeth, not aboue 15. yeare old: two of his expeditions are here descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed:
the one in passing thor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>gh in recouering <hi>Syria,</hi> and other parts of his owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey:
the other in assaulting <hi>Ptolome</hi> at home, euen at his owne fortresse and munition cities
in the borders of Egypt.</p>
                        <p>In the first expedition, <hi>Antiochus</hi> had two great lettes in his way, which he ouercame,
first two brethren <hi>Molan</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> contemning <hi>Antiochus</hi> youth, would haue vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
all the countrey beyond Taurus: them first he ouercame: then he had to deale with Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomes
captaines, which held Syria for him: but here <hi>Theodotus</hi> helped him, who reuolted
from <hi>Philopator,</hi> both taking aduantage of his voluptuous and slouthfull life, and for that he
had sustained some disgrace beeing called to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> where he was in daunger of his
life: This <hi>Theodotus</hi> vpon these occasions betraied Syria into <hi>Antiochus</hi> hands: And vpon
this aduantage he still proceeded, and recouered many cities and countreys, as <hi>Polybius</hi>
sheweth at large, <hi>lib.</hi> 5.</p>
                        <p>Then sent <hi>Ptolome</hi> an embassage vnto <hi>Antiochus,</hi> somewhat to stay him, vntill he might
make himselfe strong: and <hi>Antiochus</hi> admitted some parle and treatise of peace: But there
could be no agreement, for <hi>Ptolome</hi> challenged those countreys as belonging vnto him by
right of inheritance: <hi>Antiochus</hi> layd claime vnto them by a former composition, made by
<hi>Cassander, Seleucus, Ptolome,</hi> when they ouercame <hi>Antigonus,</hi> that Syria and Palestina
should belong vnto <hi>Seleucus:</hi> Thus they breaking off without any conclusion of peace, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi>
goeth forward, and had diuerse conflicts with <hi>Nicolaus Philopators</hi> captaine both by

                        </p>
                        <p>2. Now followeth the second part of the description, how <hi>Philopator</hi> beeing thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked
euen at his owne doores did come against <hi>Antiochus</hi> with a great armie, and encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
with him at <hi>Raphia</hi> and preuailed, as is shewed here, v. 11. more particularly thus is
this storie reported by <hi>Polybius</hi> and <hi>Iustine. 1. Ptolome,</hi> while the treatise of peace was in
hand, hired souldiers out of Grecia, and gathered together a great armie of 70. thousand
footemen, and 5000. horsemen, and 73. elephants: <hi>Antiochus</hi> also came against him with
an other great armie, of 62. thousand footemen, 6000. horsemen, elephants 102. 2. These
armies meeting at <hi>Raphia,</hi> after certaine dayes ioyned battell: the fight was at the first doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:
for the right wing of <hi>Antiochus</hi> had the better, but the left wing the worse: But at
last the victorie fell out vnto <hi>Ptolome,</hi> but not without great slaughter of his mercenary men.
3. In the 3. booke of the Macchabes in the beginning an other circumstance is added, which
furthered the fight on Ptolomes side: how Arsinoe Ptolomes sister, went vp and downe
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:18834:207"/>
the campe as they were in fight, calling vpon the souldiers, and encouraging them, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to each man two pound of gold, if they got the victorie: But whether this were so or
not, <hi>Ptolome</hi> obtained the victorie: and of Antiochus side there were 10. thousand foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
slaine, and 300. horsemen, 4000. taken prisoners, and 3. elephants were killed in the
fight, and two afterward died of the wounds which they had in the battell: thus according
to the text, the multitude was giuen into his hands.</p>
                        <p>3. The euents which followed this victorie are rehearsed to be three. 1. the insolenci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
both of <hi>Ptolomes</hi> armie, called here the multitude: for he had as great an armie as Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus:
and of Ptolome himselfe: who thinking it sufficient that he had gotten the victorie,
was content, giuing himselfe to case and pleasure, to accept of conditions of peace, which
Antiochus entreated of him: whereas, as <hi>Iustine</hi> writeth, <hi>spoliavisset regno Antiochum, si
fortunam virtute iuvisset,</hi> he had spoiled Antiochus of his kingdome, if by his owne valour
he had helped his good fortunes.</p>
                        <p>2. An other euent was, <hi>he shall cast downe: housands:</hi> which <hi>Hierome</hi> vnderstandeth of
his former victorie: but it may better be referred to his cruell outrage practised vpon the
Iewes: for comming to Ierusalem he pressed to goe into the most holy place, but was gaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayed
by the high Priest: yet he forcing to enter, was striken of God, and carried away halfe
dead: whereupon he afterward returning to Alexandria, gaue forth verie cruell edicts against
the Iewes, commanding many to be killed, others to be fettred and imprisoned, and some to
be trampled vpon vnder the camels feete, 3. Macchab. c. 7. <hi>Bulling. Melancth. Polan.</hi> And
hereof <hi>Iosephus</hi> maketh mention, that betweene Antiochus Megas and Philopator, Iudea
was as ship tossed to and fro of the waues, and went to wracke on both sides, <hi>lib.</hi> 12. c. 3.</p>
                        <p>3. The last euent is, <hi>he shal not preuaile,</hi> which was diuers waies effected: 1. for he neither
preuailed against <hi>Antiochus,</hi> who escaped his hands, and held his kingdome still, <hi>Hierome,</hi>
2. And notwithstanding his rage against the people of God, the Lord defended them. 3.
After this he gaue himselfe to all beastly pleasure: for he killed his wife and sister <hi>Euridice:</hi>
he kept both a male concubine <hi>Agathocles,</hi> and <hi>Agathoclea</hi> his sister, <hi>Iustin. lib.</hi> 30. 4. And
within fewe yeares he himselfe died, <hi>Melancthon.</hi>

                        <p>Now followe diuerse other expeditions and attempts of this Antiochus against the king
of Egypt, vnto v. 18. with his ende, v. 19.</p>
                        <p>In this first is set forth his preparation, v. 13. then his successe, v. 14. In his preparation
there are three things expressed, the number of his armie, the time, after certaine yeares, and
his great riches: for <hi>Philopator</hi> beeing now dead, and <hi>Epiphanes</hi> his sonne left but young,
whose tuition together with the gouernement of the kingdome was committed to <hi>Agatho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>
an infamous person, <hi>Philopators</hi> minion, by which occasion many fell away from the
king of Egypt; <hi>Antiochus</hi> took this to be a fit opportunity to recouer his former estate, both
in the nonage of the young king, who was but 4. yeare old when his father died, and because
the Egyptians were at variance among themselues: for they rose vp against <hi>Agathocles,</hi> and
killed him, and the strumpets they hanged vp, and then sent embassadors to Rome, that they
would take vpon them the protection of the young king and his kingdome, to whose trust
Philopator dying had commended his sonne. The Romanes twice sent embassadours to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus,
who had inuaded diuerse cities in Syria, belonging to the king of Egypt: but for all
this Antiochus surceased not, <hi>Hierome ex Iustin.</hi> therefore it is said in the text, <hi>veniendo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niet,</hi>
he shall certainely or speedily come, nothing could let him.</p>
                        <p>And concerning his rich preparation, this may be an euident proofe thereof: that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
when he prepared in like manner to encounter with the Romanes, and at that time,
Hannibal beeing ouercome of the Romanes was fledde vnto him, he shewed vnto him his
chariots and Elephants set forth with ornaments of siluer and gold, and asked him if this
were not sufficient for the Romanes, who made this answer, <hi>satis esse credo Romanis haec om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,
licet sint auarissimi,</hi> I thinke these things may suffice and content the Romanes, though
they were most couetous, &amp;c. <hi>Gellius in Noctib. Attic. lib.</hi> 5. c. 5. his meaning was, that it
would be a sufficient pray, whereas Antiochus had asked his opinion of the sufficiencie of
his preparation.</p>
                        <p>2. Then in the successe described, v. 14. is shewed, 1. the helpe that Antiochus had. 2.
how he preuailed against those factious persons which tooke part with the king of Egypt.</p>

some vnderstand of the Iewes which hitherto had taken part with the king of Egypt, who
should now ioyne with Antiochus, <hi>Iun.</hi> but it is better vnderstood, of the league and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacie
which Antiochus made with <hi>Philip</hi> king of Macedon, that they should both ioyne
together against the king of Egypt, and part his cities among them, each of them to take the
cities next adioyning, <hi>Hierome.</hi> which confederacie was the occasion of warre betweene
the Romanes and the said <hi>Philip:</hi> who beeing ouercome by <hi>Flaminius</hi> the Consull, lost a

Iewes, which stood against Antiochus, and were refractarie against God and his laws.
1. These rebellious and refractarie Iewes are well vnderstood to be those which fled with
Onias (beeing expelled by Iason) vnto the king of Egypt, (which <hi>Iosephus</hi> saith was <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metor</hi>)
but by the words of the prophesie it is better referred to these times of Ptolome E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uergetes,
who gaue vnto Onias leaue to build a Temple in Egypt in the region of <hi>Hierapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi>
about 180. furlongs from <hi>Memphis,</hi> which <hi>Onias</hi> accordingly did: making it in some
things like, in some things vnlike to the Temple of Ierusalem: So herein they are called re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractraie,
because against the ordinance of God, that appointed the place of his publike
worship onely at Ierusalem, where they should offer all their sacrifices, yet did erect a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in an other place.</p>
                        <p>2. Whereas it is said, <hi>to establish the vision:</hi> this also agreeth verie fitly: some vnderstand
it, of the fulfilling this present vision, <hi>Iun. annot. Polan.</hi> but that fulfilling was against their
will: now here their purpose and intendment seemeth to be noted: <hi>to establish the vision:</hi> and
so Onias pretended, that herein he fulfilled the prophecie of Isay. c. 19. v. 19. <hi>that the altar

that place is vnderstood of the spirituall worship of God, which should be established in
Egypt at the comming of the Messiah, which euidently appeareth out of the same place: for
there the Prophet speaketh of a generall vnitie and concord, that should be betweene <hi>Assur,
Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Iudaea,</hi> which was not now in the time of this Onias: for the <hi>Assyrians</hi> now vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Antiochus</hi> were enemies to the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> And beside <hi>Eusebius</hi> out of this verie place
sheweth, that the sacrifices and ceremonies of Moses law were to cease: for seeing by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
lawe they were not to sacrifice, nor to set vp any altar but at Ierusalem, if that law should
not be abolished, the prophesie of Isay of setting vp an altar, that is the true seruice of God
in Egypt, could not haue beene fulfilled: to this purpose <hi>Eusebius, lib. 1. de domonst. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangel.</hi>
c. 4.</p>
                        <p>3. Then it followeth what shall become of those refractarie persons: <hi>they shall fall. 1.
Hierome</hi> vnderstandeth it of the destruction of this newe Temple, and the citie, which came
to passe, 330. yeare after, as Iosephus writeth, vnder <hi>Vespasian</hi> the Emperour: who when he
had destroyed the Temple at Ierusalem, sent vnto <hi>Lupus</hi> president of Alexandria, to demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
the other Temple in Egypt, least it might be an occasion of mutinie and rebellion to the
Iewes: But this <hi>Lupus</hi> onely spoiled the Temple of the ornaments thereof: <hi>Paulinus</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
him vtterly abolished the seruice, which the Iewes there exercised, and shut vp the
Temple for euer, not suffering the same to be vsed at all: and so it came to ruine, <hi>Iosephus
lib. 7. de bello Iudaic.</hi> c. 30. But this ruine and fall here prophecied of seemeth to haue been
present, to shew how <hi>Antiochus</hi> preuailed against them. Some vnderstand it of the Iewes
in <hi>Palestina,</hi> which rebelled against <hi>Antiochus, Polan. Iun.</hi> in his last edition: But in his

                        <p>Here two things are declared in this third exploit: first the attempt of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> then the
euent.</p>
                        <p>His attempt was partly by force, but seeing he could not preuaile that way, he seeketh to
compasse his desire by subtiltie and craft, (affecting the gouernement and kingdome of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt)
in giuing his daughter <hi>Cleopatra</hi> to Epiphanes: wherein three things are expressed:
1. his subtill intent, he pretended peace and amitie, offred equall conditions of peace, <hi>vt
recta faciat,</hi> to doe rights, as the <hi>Latine</hi> interpreter: some read, <hi>his confederates with him,
B. G.</hi> but the other sense is better, <hi>Iun. Polan.</hi> for, as <hi>Appian</hi> writeth, <hi>Antiochus</hi> feared the
Romane power, and when they sent vnto him embassadors to restore the cities which he had
taken from <hi>Ptolome,</hi> he made answer, that there was amitie betweene him and <hi>Ptolome,</hi> and
that he intended to make him his sonne in law, <hi>Appian in Syriac.</hi> 2. then it is said, <hi>he shall
giue him the daughter of women:</hi> which <hi>Hierome</hi> thinketh to be a <hi>pleonasme,</hi> as when we say,
<hi>he spake with his mouth:</hi> but it signifieth more: <hi>Iunius</hi> vnderstandeth by this phrase, to be a
virgin: <hi>Polan.</hi> that she was <hi>ferme lactens,</hi> yet but young, and in a manner a suckling: but
(though this were true) yet it is better interpreted, that she was <hi>bath nashim,</hi> a daughter of
women, that is, of special womanhood: to the which answereth her name <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of the countrey: <hi>H. Br. concent.</hi> and so <hi>Vatablus</hi> translateth, <hi>pulcherrima foemina,</hi> she
was a most beautifull woman, so also <hi>Perer. a choice woman, Osiand.</hi> And together with
this daughter, <hi>Antiochus</hi> promised by way of dowrie, <hi>Coelesyria, Phoenice, Iudaea,</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria,</hi>
the reuenues to be deuided betweene them, <hi>Ioseph. lib. 12. antiquit. c.</hi> 3. 3. It
followeth to corrupt her, not, as the Latine, to destroy it, that is, the kingdome: or as <hi>Perer.</hi>
readeth, to destroy him, that is her husband: for the pronoune affix is of the feminine gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
neither is the meaning, <hi>to destroy her, V. G. B.</hi> for <hi>Antiochus</hi> had no meaning herein
to seeke the destruction of his daughter, but he corrupted her with euill cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

neither of them were mariageable. <hi>Hierome</hi> saith, that <hi>Epiphanes</hi> was but fowre yeare old
when he beganne to raigne, and <hi>Cleopatra</hi> was betrothed to him in the 7. yeare of his raigne,
and married in his 13. yeare: In the meane time <hi>Antiochus</hi> had the keeping of her, and so
corrupted her with euill counsell, and gaue her instructions how she should practise to take
her husband away by poyson, or some such like meanes: and this is vnderstood by corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
her.</p>
                        <p>2. Then the euent was this, contrary to his expectation: for <hi>Cleopatra</hi> like a good wife

tooke part with her husband, and obeied not her fathers wicked counsell: and by her means

countries, v. 18.</head>
                        <p>Here is described first his attempt, with his successe; then the euent which followed.</p>
                        <p>1. Antiochus beeing disappointed of his hope for Egypt, both because his daughter had
deceiued him, and <hi>Epiphanes</hi> was in league with the Romanes, then he set his minde to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade
other countries, which are here called the Isles, because they were diuided from him
by Sea: as <hi>Hellespontus, Chersonesus, Euboea:</hi> then he stroke ouer into Europe, and tooke di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
Islands, <hi>Rhodes, Cyprus, Samos, Colophon:</hi> and so did bidde as it were open battell vnto
the Romanes: which he before intending, thought to make himselfe strong, by a new alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with forren Princes: for as he had married his daughter Cleopatra to Epiphanes king
of Egypt, so he gaue in marriage his daughter <hi>Antiochis</hi> to Ariaratus king of Cappadocia:
and a third daughter he offered vnto <hi>Eumenes</hi> king of Pergamus, but he refused, because of
the warres which he had with the Romanes. <hi>Appian.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. The euent followeth: that in the ende <hi>Antiochus</hi> was foiled by the Romanes, and
the shame returned vpon his owne head: but first the words of the text must be opened,
and then the sense considered.</p>
                        <p>1. The words are diuersly read: 1. the vulgar Latin readeth thus, <hi>he shall cause the
Prince of his shame to cease:</hi> which <hi>Lyranus</hi> expoundeth of himselfe, namely, Antiochus: but
he misliketh this sense, because Antiochus rather still encreased his owne s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ame, he caused
it not to cease. 2. Then he giueth an other interpretation, <hi>a Prince or Lord shall bring his
shame vpon him,</hi> that is God, whome he had blasphemed, shall bring him to shame. <hi>Pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
reiecteth this sense, because it is not found, that this Antiochus blasphemed God:
wherein he is deceiued: for the contrarie is euident, that <hi>Antiochus,</hi> when all things went
crosse against him, accused God, as though he were his enemie, <hi>Polan.</hi> but the word <hi>katin</hi>
signifieth a leader, or gouerner, which is not so fitly referred vnto God. 3. <hi>Theodoret</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
in the (plural) <hi>he shall cause the Princes of his shame to cease,</hi> that is, shall vanquish di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
Princes, and put them to shame: but the word is put in the singular. 4. Some applie it
to Epiphanes king of Egypt, who by his captaine <hi>Scopas</hi> had put Antiochus to shame, in
taking certaine cities from him: <hi>gloss. interlin. Hug. Card.</hi> and <hi>Pererius</hi> misliketh not this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position:
But the truth is, that Antiochus put <hi>Scopas</hi> to shame, causing him to yeeld him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.
5. The words then, are thus to be read, <hi>a Prince or captaine shal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                                 <desc>••</desc>
                              </gap>ause his shame to
cease, beside that he shall cause his shame to returne vpon him, Polan.</hi> that is, the shame which
he offered to others shall returne vpon himselfe.</p>
                        <p>Now for the meaning of the words, two things are declared. 1. the Prince or captaine
shall cause his shame to cease. 2. then it shall returne vpon his owne head. 1. First, his
contumelious and opprobrious words, and acts, spoken and done against the Romanes, cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
when first he was ouercome by <hi>Marcus Attilius Glabrio</hi> the Romane captaine, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
by <hi>L. Scipio Nasica</hi> (accompanied with <hi>Publius Scipio Africanus</hi> his brother) by Sea:
After this foyle Antiochus, beeing not ruled by <hi>Hannibals</hi> counsell, who was with him,
who gaue him aduise to remooue his forces into Italie, and to occupie the Romanes at
home at their owne doores, was in such feare of the Romanes, that he fled from <hi>Chersone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>
leauing all the furniture and prouision of his owne behind, which the Romanes surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed:
then he sent Embassadours vnto the Scipios, offering to beare halfe the charges of their
battell, and to relinquish all the cities which he had taken in <hi>Ionia,</hi> and <hi>Aeolia:</hi> but they
made answer that they would haue all the charges of that expedition, which he had beene
cause of, and he must surrender all the countrey on this side the mount Taurus: But Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus
refusing these hard conditions, encountred with the Romanes againe, who had not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
30. thousand men, and he 70. thousand, in which battell he was discomfited, and lost
50. thousand men, and all his Elephants, sauing 15. which were taken aliue: and thus his
proud spirit was abated, and his contumelies offered vnto the Romanes in word and deede,
were at an ende.</p>
                        <p>2. Then last of all his shame was brought vpon his owne head: for vpon a second
embassage he was forced to accept of most hard conditions. 1. that he should leaue
all Asia on this side Taurus. 2. he should pay in present money fifteene hundred talents
for the charges of the warre. 3. he should deliuer vp all his Elephants, and shippes
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:18834:209"/>
so many as they should require: and should be stinted afterward for the number of his
shippes. 4. he should pay yearely 12. thousand talents for tribute for 12. yeares. 5. and
giue 20. hostages, whereof one should be his sonne, for the performance of these conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
all which he vndertooke: and thus his owne shame returned vpon him: and further in
disdaine, whereas he was called before, <hi>Antiochus</hi> the great, it grew into a byword among
the Romanes, Antiochus sometime the great king. <hi>ex Livio decad. 4. l.</hi> 8. and <hi>App. in Syriac.</hi>

                        <p>Two things are here declared, his shamefull flight, and his shamefull ende.</p>
                        <p>1. After that he had receiued the last great ouerthrow, with the losse of so many men,
he fled away incontinently, and about midnight came to Sardis: thence to Apamea, from
whence he sent Embassadors, which concluded the former peace with the Romanes vpon
those hard conditions. Then he betooke himselfe to the remote parts of his kingdome, to
his munitions and holds, beeing in such feare, as that he durst not endure the sight of <hi>Cn.
Manlius,</hi> who succeeded <hi>L. Scipio.</hi> Thus Antiochus was confined within Taurus: who in
this disgrace, was wont to say iestingly, as <hi>Tullie</hi> reporteth in his oration <hi>pro Deiotaro, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigne
sibi à Romanis factum, &amp;c.</hi> he was beholding to the Romanes, who had eased him of
the trouble of so great a kingdome, that he now contented himselfe with a lesse.</p>
                        <p>2. Now touching his ende, there are diuers opinions. 1. after that he had such an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of tribute laid vpon him, partly through necessitie, and partly of a couetous minde,
he went about <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> robbe a Temple of their treasure: <hi>Lyranus</hi> thinketh it was the Temple of

Some following <hi>Iustine lib.</hi> 32. thinke, that he would haue inuaded the Temple of <hi>Iuppiter

king of Egypt: but as <hi>Hierome</hi> well sheweth, he did not succeede Antiochus the great
in his kingdome, and therefore can not be saide to stand vp in his place.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>R. Levi</hi> vnderstandeth here the sonne of Antiochus Epiphanes, called Antiochus
Eupator, who was slaine by his vncles sonne Demetrius: and the former part of the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
he interpreteth of Antiochus Epiphanes: <hi>ex Oecolampad.</hi> But it is euident, that hitherto
the Prophet hath described the acts and exploits of Antiochus, surnamed the great: for he
it was, that gaue his daughter <hi>Cleopatra</hi> in marriage vnto the king of Egypt, as is prophesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
v. 17. And the rest of the prophesie can agree to none other.</p>
                        <p>3. Some Hebrewes, as <hi>Hierome</hi> also here writeth, thinke that this was <hi>Tryphon,</hi> which
was the tutor of Antiochus sonne: but that can not be: for Tryphon followed many genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
after: for after Antiochus the great succeeded in order, <hi>Seleucus, Epiphanes, Eupator</hi>
his sonne, <hi>Demetrius, Alexander, Antiochus,</hi> before <hi>Tryphon</hi> vsurped the kingdome. He
that rose vp in Antiochus place, was the 7. king of Syria, but Tryphon was the 13. or 14.

                        </p>
                        <p>4. Wherefore this that rose vp in Antiochus place, was <hi>Seleucus</hi> his sonne. Antiochus
the great had three sonnes, Antiochus, Seleucus, and Antiochus Epiphanes: but Antiochus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
beeing a Prince of great hope and towardnes, died about the same time, that his father flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Apamea, sent Embassadors to the Romanes about the former conclusion of peace,
not without suspition of poison: then succeeded Seleucus <hi>Philopator,</hi> so called because he

passe. And so was <hi>Seleucus</hi> a great exactor of tribute: for beeing giuen to voluptuous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
he must needes also be immoderate in his expenses: when he was admonished by his
familiar counsellers, that he should take heede least he alienated the mindes of his friends,
by his immoderate taxations, he would answer them, that his money was his friend. This
<hi>Seleucus</hi> is he that sent Heliodorus to spoile the treasure of the Temple at Ierusalem,

                        <p>2. Then the ende of <hi>Seleucus</hi> is prophesied of. 1. concerning the time, <hi>after a few
daies he should be destroied:</hi> then can not 12. yeares be assigned to his raigne, as <hi>Oecolampad.</hi>
and it appeareth 2. Macchab. 4. 7. that he liued not long after Heliodorus attempted to
robbe the Temple at Ierusalem. 2. for the manner of his death: it should neither be by
wrath, nor by battell, either by the generall hatred of his subiects, or by open warre: but it is
thought that he was poisoned by Heliodorus, and that by the practise of Antiochus Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes
his brother, who was comming from Rome, where he was left as an hostage, and was
at Athens at that same time when <hi>Seleucus</hi> died. And this was a iust recompence vpon him
for his sacriledge, that he should be cut off euen by him, that was an instrument of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie.

Antiochus Epiphanes, or of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ.</head>
                        <p>1. Some would haue this to be a propheticall narration of the acts and doings of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,
and make no mention at all of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> as <hi>Polychronius:</hi> But it is euident that
many things can not be otherwise applied, then to Antiochus: as v. 21. <hi>in his place shall
stand vp a vile person,</hi> that is, in the roome of <hi>Seleucus Philopator,</hi> before spoken of: and
v. 25. it is said, he shall stirre vp his power against the king of the South, who is vnderstood
before to be the king of Egypt: so that it is euident, that this is a continuance of the same
propheticall narration.</p>
                        <p>2. Some doe applie some part of this prophesie vnto Antiochus, yet as a type of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,
and some things onely vnto Antichrist: and these things are intermingled together:
as Matth. 24. Christ prophesieth of the destruction of Ierusalem, and of the ende of the
world ioyntly: so in this place, they thinke that the manners of Antiochus and of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
are described interchangeably: <hi>Theodoret.</hi> So also <hi>Lyranus,</hi> who thus distinguisheth
of figures and signes: that some things are so figures, as the thing prefigured concerneth
them not at all: as Psal. 72. <hi>His dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the riuer to the
endes of the world:</hi> this place he thinketh onely to be true of Christ, and not at all to agree
vnto Salamon: some figures are such, that the thing affirmed, agreeth both to the figure,
and to the thing prefigured: as, 1. Chr. 22. 10. <hi>He shall be my sonne, and I will be his father:</hi>
this was true of Salomon in part, but of Christ more fitly: so some things here are spoken
of Antiochus as of a figure of Antichrist, and some things onely agree vnto Antichrist: as
from the 36. v. to the ende of the chapter: But, as <hi>Melancthon</hi> saith, <hi>non avellam hanc par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
ab historia Antiochi,</hi> I will not pull away this part neither from the historie of Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus:
for mention is made after that of Edom, and other nations adioyning, which is euident
to be historicall.</p>
                        <p>3. Some wholly referre this prophesie vnto Antiochus, without any relation at all vnto
Antichrist, as <hi>Hierome</hi> here affirmeth of <hi>Porphyrius.</hi> But it is euident by the propheticall
booke of the Revelation, which taketh many things from this prophesie, that there is some
relation and allusion in this propheticall discourse vnto Antichrist.</p>
                        <p>4. Some doe make <hi>Antiochus</hi> a speciall type of Antichrist, and make him the image, and
Antichrist the <hi>Archetypus,</hi> the principall person represented and resembled: and thinke that
many things here done doe more fitly agree vnto Antichrist, then vnto Antiochus. <hi>Pappus.</hi>
But it is euident, that the description of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and his cruell outrage against the church
of God, is principally intended by the Prophet; because this prophesie was deliuered for
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:18834:210"/>
the comfort of the Church in those daies, to the comming of the Messiah.</p>
                        <p>5. Wherefore the literall and proper sense of this prophesie aymeth onely at Antiochus:
yet so, as by way of allusion and analogie, as a common type, Antiochus example, conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
practises, may be drawne and by way of application accommodated to decypher Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ.
<hi>Iun. Polan.</hi> But these typicall applications vnto Antichrist, shall be referred vnto their
proper and peculiar place among the controversies.</p>

                        <head>32. Quest. of Antiochus Epiphanes first entrance to the
kingdome.</head>
                        <p>Three things are orderly handled in this prophesie. 1. of <hi>Antiochus</hi> succeeding in the
kingdome. 2. of his acts and exploits. 3. of his ende: In the handling of which things
the rest of this chapter is spent: for seeing this Antiochus should be the greatest and most
cruell aduersarie vnto the Iewes, and that vnder him, they should endure much miserie, it
was necessarie that the people of God should afore-hand be prepared for those times.</p>
                        <p>First then his entrance to the kingdome is thus set forth, 1. by the very act of his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession.
2. by the small right which he had vnto it. 3. and by the euill meanes, which he
vsed.</p>
                        <p>1. It is saide, that in his place one should stand vp: namely, <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> in the
roome and stead of his father. 2. but his right should be small thereunto: for whereas suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
vnto kingdomes is either by the naturall right of succession, or by election and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;
he came by neither of these meanes to the kingdome: for he was the younger brother,
and left hostage at Rome for his father, and so he was in that behalfe neglected and despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
not designed or appointed by his father vnto the kingdome: and when his elder brother
was dead, he left behind him his sonne Demetrius, who was left as a pledge for <hi>Antiochus</hi>
at Rome, whom <hi>Seleucus</hi> sent for to ayd him in his warres: thus <hi>Antiochus</hi> was despised and
neglected in respect of naturall succession. <hi>Iun. Polan.</hi> And in regard of his vile conditions,
and loathsome vices he was despised also: so that it seemeth, he was called <hi>Epiphanes,</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
by the contrarie, beeing indeede despised: which name was turned by the change of
a letter, into <hi>Epimanes,</hi> which signifieth furious, madde. <hi>Athenaeus ex Polyb.</hi> And concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the right of succession, which is by election, <hi>Antiochus</hi> wanted it likewise: as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
in the text, <hi>to whome they shall not giue the honour of the kingdome:</hi> he was not
called or adopted to the gouernment by the consent of the nobles of the land: Onely
he was fauoured and helped by two forren kings, <hi>Eumenes,</hi> and <hi>Attalus.</hi> 3. Then the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
is shewed how he attained to the kingdome: he at the first tooke vpon him to be the
protector of the kingdome for his brothers sonne Demetrius beeing absent, vntill by flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie
he had established himselfe. He was very popular and familiar euen with meane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:
he would stand in the streetes and cast abroad money, crying out, <hi>Let him that fortune
fauoureth take it:</hi> he vsed to wash in the common bathes, and to drinke with common per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
he would giue large gifts to whomsoeuer he met, though he had neuer seene them
before: he would sport himselfe with those that attended vpon him, and hit stones at them
in iest: and thus by his flatterie and popular behauiour he insinuated himselfe, and got the
hearts of the people: as <hi>Absalom</hi> by the like meanes stole away the hearts of the people
from his father. Thus <hi>Ptolome</hi> testifieth of this <hi>Antiochus, lib. 1. &amp; 5. Hypomemnat.</hi>

                        <p>Secondly the entrance of <hi>Antiochus</hi> into the kingdome beeing thus described, then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth

                        <p>Three expeditions he made into Egypt: the first whereof is here described. In this first
the meanes are shewed, which he should vse, partly violence, partly fraud: and the successe
of them both.</p>
                        <p>His forcible and violent attempt together with the successe, is expressed v. 22. his attempt
is compared to an ouerflowing flood: <hi>Antiochus</hi> taking aduantage of the minoritie of
<hi>Ptolomeus Philometor,</hi> the sonne of Epiphanes by his sister <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and hauing a desire
to ioyne Egypt to his kingdome, commeth with a great power with chariots, horse, Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants,
and a nauie beside vnto <hi>Pelusium,</hi> ouerflowing like a great streame: his successe was
this: First, the armes and power of the Egyptians were ouercome, the chiefe captaines of
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:18834:210"/>
Philometor <hi>Euleus</hi> and <hi>Leneus</hi> encountring with Antiochus betweene Pelusium and Casi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,
were there vanquished and slaine: <hi>Hierome</hi> out of <hi>Porphyrius</hi> following <hi>Suctorius<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> so
also <hi>Bulling. Melancth. Osiand. Polan. Iun.</hi> with others.</p>
                        <p>The second part of this successe was, <hi>the Prince of the couenant was ouerthrowne</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
1. which was not Ptolomeus Epiphanes, as <hi>Hugo Cardin.</hi> who was now dead. 2.
nor yet Seleucus Philopater Antiochus brother, <hi>Iun. annotat. H. Br. concent.</hi> for it is said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
v. 21. that Antiochus named a vile person, stood vp in his place: his brother Seleucus
was now dead. 3. neither was it <hi>Iudas Macchabeus,</hi> as <hi>Lyran.</hi> for as yet Antiochus had
nothing to doe with him. 4. nor yet Ptolome Philopator, as <hi>Melancth. Oecolamp. Pellic.
Vatab.</hi> for he was yet very young, and made no couenant: and beside the Prince of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant
here spoken of was slaine, which is expressed by the metaphor of breaking: but Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lometor
suruiued, and raigned long after. 5. And to applie it with <hi>Hierome</hi> to Antichrist,
who shall faigne himselfe to be Prince of the couenant, that is, of the law and Testament of
God, is not proper: for if Antiochus be a type of Antichrist, then is not this Prince of the
couenant, which is ouercome by him, Antichrist also. 6. Wherefore this Prince of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant
was <hi>Tryphon,</hi> who was a chiefe man in compounding and making a league with
Antiochus after the former ouerthrow, that he should haue the tutelage of the young
king of Egypt Philometor his nephew: this Tryphon the chiefe contriuer of this coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
Antiochus causeth to be taken away, that he might worke his pleasure without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
let.</p>
                        <p>Then followeth his second practise by fraud, with the successe: first Antiochus hauing
now committed vnto him the protection of his nephew, vnder this pretence entreth into
Egypt, but with a small companie, beeing not suspected as an enemie, but held as a friend:
and therefore it is said, <hi>he shall strengthen himselfe with a small people,</hi> v. 23.</p>
                        <p>His successe by this his fraudulent practising was this. 1. he shall enter into the quiet
and plentifull Prouince: for he setled himselfe in Memphis in the heart of the countrey. 2.
then he robbed and spoiled, as neuer any of his predecessours did in Egypt before: for he is
not said simply to doe that, which his fathers had not done, but onely in respect of Egypt,
otherwise Seleucus Nicanor, their first founder, and Antiochus the great his father, had in
other countries done more then he, <hi>Calvin.</hi> therefore this is no argument for <hi>Pererius</hi> to
vnderstand this of Antichrist, and not of Antiochus, because his predecessours had beene of
greater power: for, as is saide, it is not simply and absolutely so spoken, but in comparison
of Egypt onely, which he robbed and spoiled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as none of his fathers had done before him.
<hi>Hierom. ex Porphyr.</hi> And these spoiles he partly carried away, partly he distributed them
among the Egyptians, to make himselfe stronger. <hi>Iun.</hi> 3. Then he cunningly cast about
how to get into his hand the strong holds in Egypt: and therein shewed more cunning,
then the wisest among the Egyptians: he deceiued them with his wiles and politike deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
<hi>Hierom. ex Porphyr.</hi> following <hi>Suctorius. Iun. Polan.</hi> But he did not long hold those
places in Egypt, it was but for a time, as the text sheweth: for Philometor afterward reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
them againe.</p>
                        <p>Some otherwise vnderstand this whole description: that the league spoken of was made
with Seleucus Philopator, who vpon agreement with Antiochus then hostage at Rome,
sent thither his owne sonne Demetrius, to be in his stead: and so Antiochus returning first
practised by the meanes of <hi>Heliodorus</hi> to take away his brother Seleucus, called here the
Prince of the couenant. <hi>Iun. in annotat.</hi> And this plentifull Prouince which he inuaded, some
vnderstand to be Syria, <hi>Iun. Oecolampad.</hi> some <hi>Phoenice,</hi> where the rich citie Tyrus was,
which Antiochus spoiled, <hi>Melancthon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But this exposition can not stand. 1. Seleucus Philopator was dead before these things
were done, and Antiochus tose vp in his stead: these things followed then after Seleucus
death. And before the Prince of the couenant is taken away, it is said the armes were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
which were the captaines with their power: but Antiochus had no open warre with
his brother Seleucus, he was dead before his returne.</p>
                        <p>2. This pleasant Prouince was not Syria, but Egypt. 1. for it is saide, that he did that,
which none of his fathers before him: now both Seleucus Nicanor, and Antiochus the
great had done greater exploits in Syria and Phenice, then this Antiochus: but none of them
had spoiled Egypt like vnto him. 2. he held these strong places onely for a while: but the
strong cities of Syria &amp; Phenicia he held and possessed as his own, as of right belonging vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:18834:211"/>
to him: he soone lost the strong cities and holds in Egypt, which Philometor recouered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:
therefore this expedition vpon the former reasons is better vnderstood to haue beene
made against Egypt, then Syria.</p>

                        <p>In this second expedition, three things are declared, 1. the attempt, which these kings
made one against the other, with the successe, v. 25. and the meanes thereof, v. 26. 2. the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent,
which happened hereupon, v. 27. a dissembled peace. 3. the consequents, and such
matters as followed, v. 28.</p>
                        <p>1. The king of the North Antiochus, seeing he could preuaile no longer by his fraud
and deceit, who hitherto vnder colour of his protectourship, robbed and spoiled Egypt,
(Philometor beeing now somewhat more growne in yeares) he seeketh now by open force
to inuade Egypt: and the king of Egypt, called here the king of the South, prepareth to
meete him with a great armie likewise: this was the preparation. But the successe was this:
the king of Egypt was not able to stand, he is ouercome with his armie: and the meanes
which Antiochus vfed, was this: he corrupted Ptolomes captaines and counsellers with
gifts, who betraied Ptolomes armie: euen his owne feed men, and courtiers, that liued vpon
him, should deceiue him, v. 26.</p>
                        <p>2. The euent was this, that after <hi>Philometor</hi> was ouercome, he should make some peace
with Antiochus: but it was a fraudulent peace: where 1. their intent and purpose is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
both the kings hearts shall be to doe mischiefe. 2. their dissimulation, they shall
speake deceitfully at the same table: for <hi>Philometor</hi> feasted <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and gaue him great
gifts. 3. but the issue was this, nothing was effected or concluded by this peace: for the
time appointed of God was not yet, v. 27.</p>
                        <p>3. The sequele was this. 1. Antiochus returneth into his countrey with great substance,
partly by the gift of Ptolome, partly by spoiling with his armie. 2. In his returne he set his
heart against the holy Couenant, that is, the people of God: for he entred into Ierusalem
beeing receiued by wicked <hi>Iason,</hi> and robbed and spoiled the Temple, though as yet he set
not vp the abomination of desolation: as is further shewed, 1. Macchab. 1. 18. and 2. Macch.
4. 24.</p>
                        <p>Some vnderstand this battell to haue beene fought vnder <hi>Euleus</hi> and <hi>Leneus</hi> Ptolomes
captaines, at which time <hi>Antiochus</hi> entred into Egypt, robbing and spoiling, and came to
<hi>Memphis. Iun. annotat. 1. &amp; 2. edit. Oecolampad. Bulling.</hi> But this can not be: 1. this was
Antiochus second voyage into Egypt, 2. Macch. 5. 1. but that battell vnder those captaines
was fought in his first voyage. 2. at this time Ptolomes captaines were corrupted, which
could not be the foresaid Euleus and Leneus, for they were slaine in battell. 3. hitherto
Antiochus had dealt by cunning and fraud, but now he went about by force to raigne ouer
Egypt, 1. Macchab. 1. 17. which he did not attempt at the first: for he had sent in peaceable
manner before Apollonius to the coronation of Philometor, 2. Macchab. 4. 22. 4. the
kings now practised deceit one against an other: it seemeth then that <hi>Philometor</hi> was of
yeares of discretion: but when Euleus and Leneus were slaine, he was vnder their tuition:
this <hi>Hierome</hi> foreseeing, that Philometor beeing a child could not practise any deceit or
mischiefe against <hi>Antiochus,</hi> thereupon saith, that some will haue it vnderstood of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,
who should first ouercome the king of Egypt: But Philometor was not now a very
child in Antiochus second expedition: he was somewhat growne in yeares, <hi>Osiand.</hi> for this
happened in the sixt yeare of Antiochus raigne, who beganne to raigne in the 137. yeare of
the raigne of the Greekes, and this was in the 143. yeare, 1. Macchab. 1. 11. 21. Wherefore I
rather follow <hi>Iunius</hi> interpretation in his commentarie, with <hi>Polanus,</hi> who referre the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell

<hi>Popilius</hi> with a kisse, being of his old acquaintance in Rome, &amp; would with flattering words
haue put off that matter for which <hi>Popilius</hi> came, and haue craued some time to consider of
it: But the couragious Romane, bid him leaue off his trifling, and vpon the sand did with his
rod make a circle before <hi>Antiochus,</hi> requiring his present answear before he went from that
place: who, though much against his will, there yeelded himselfe to obey his embassage: and
therefore it is said in the text, <hi>he shall be sorie and returne:</hi> thus <hi>Hierom.</hi> out of <hi>Iustin. lib.</hi> 34.
the same is reported by <hi>Florus, in epitom. lib.</hi> 45.</p>
                        <p>3. The euent was this, that this cruell Tyrant beeing disappointed of his hope in Egypt,
shall freat against the holy couenant: for in his returne he entred into Ierusalem beeing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
in peaceable manner at the first: but afterward he made hauocke of the citie, put them
to the sword, caused the daily sacrifice to cease, and set vp the abhomination of desolation, a
filthie idol in the Temple, and burnt the bookes of the lawe: as is declared, 1. Mac. 1. 57. 58.</p>
                        <p>And the meanes is shewed also how he compassed this his wicked purpose: he had inelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
by those which did forsake the holy coueuant, he was brought in by the wicked
counsell and practise first of <hi>Iason,</hi> then of <hi>Menelaus,</hi> 2. Macchab. 4. <hi>Iunius, Polanus, Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colampadius.</hi>

Chittim, v. 30.</head>
                        <p>1. Here are two words vsed, <hi>tziim,</hi> and <hi>Chittim,</hi> which some Hebrewes vnderstand to
be the Italians and Romanes, <hi>Hierome:</hi> but the first word signifieth shippes: it commeth of
<hi>tzi,</hi> which properly betokeneth a bird, and so consequently a shippe, which beeing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
saile is like a bird that flieth. 2. <hi>Iosephus</hi> whom <hi>Theodoret</hi> followeth, and <hi>Vata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blus,</hi>
vnderstand the shippes of Chittim to be shippes of the Isle Cyprus, where was a
towne called <hi>Citium,</hi> where <hi>Zeno</hi> the Stoike was borne: But the word <hi>Chittim</hi> is more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
then to be taken for one small Island: and Cyprus was vnder the command of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,
which nowe <hi>Antiochus</hi> besieged, and therefore the shippes of Cyprus could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
<hi>Antiochus.</hi> 3. Some take <hi>Chittim</hi> directly for the Romanes, as <hi>Hierome,</hi> so also the
<hi>Chalde paraphrast.</hi> and the <hi>Tharg. Hierosol.</hi> so interpreteth that place of the Italians and
Romanes, Numb. 24. 24. <hi>the shippes shall come from the coasts of Chittim, and subdue Ashur,
and shall subdue Heber:</hi> But originally <hi>Chittim,</hi> are not the Italians or Romanes: for <hi>Chittim</hi>
was one of the sonnes of <hi>Iavan</hi> the father of the Grecians: as likewise were <hi>Elisha</hi> the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the <hi>Aeliseans</hi> or <hi>Aeolians,</hi> and <hi>Dodanim</hi> of the <hi>Dodoneans,</hi> and <hi>Tharshish</hi> of the
<hi>Cilicians</hi> where <hi>Tarsus</hi> was: all these were countreys belonging vnto Grecia. 4. Some thinke
that <hi>Chittim</hi> signifieth both the Grecians, Macedonians, and Romanes, <hi>Calvin:</hi> but so we
should make it too generall a name. 5. Some vnderstand the shippes of the Romanes which
were kept in the coasts of Cilicia, (where the Isle <hi>Cetis</hi> was) that they might the better
command the Seas, <hi>Polan. Iun.</hi> But that seemeth not to be so proper to call them shippes
of Chittim, that is of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> because they onely harboured there. 6. And it is too slender
a conceit, to thinke that the Romane Embassadour came thither in shippes of Grecia, <hi>ex
Bulling.</hi> as if that potent nation of the Romanes had no shippes of their owne. 7. nor yet
is <hi>Chittim</hi> taken only for Grecia, for the shippes of Chittim came now against <hi>Antiochus,</hi>
which were not the Grecians, but the Romanes. 8. Wherefore, I thinke with <hi>Melancthon,</hi>

                        <p>This is the second persecution raised by <hi>Antiochus</hi> against the people of God, the first
was touched before, v. 28. the occasion of the second is expressed in the former verse, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
because <hi>Antiochus</hi> beeing disappointed by the Romanes, turneth his rage against the
Church of God, and partly beeing thereunto induced by such amongst the Iewes as had
forsaken the couenant.</p>
                        <p>In this second persecution, 1. there are declared the meanes, which <hi>Antiochus</hi> vsed in
oppressing Gods people: which were partly the forces, and captains, and forren helps which
he vsed: partly the seditious and factious among the people themselues. 2. the godly are
described which shall suffer persecution, to v. 36. 3. then it is shewed, what <hi>Antiochus</hi>

                        <p>Now in v. 3. the forren helpe is described, which <hi>Antiochus</hi> should vse: namely, his cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines

                        <p>1. Some of the Hebrewes by the armes doe vnderstand <hi>Thus</hi> that came of <hi>Vespasian,</hi> and
was as his arme, that destroyed Ierusalem and the Temple. 2. <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> by the armes
interpreteth the captaines of the Romanes, <hi>Pompey, Crassus, Sabinus, Cumanus Florus,</hi>
with others, which diuerse times made hauocke of the citie, spoiled and profaned the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
But the coherence of the text will allowe neither of these interpretations: for the storie
of <hi>Antiochus</hi> still is continued: he that set his heart against the holy couenant, v. 28. is the
same that fretteth against the holy couenant, beeing repelled by the shippes of Chittim, v.
30. and he that there fretteth, is the same that here polluteth the Sanctuarie. 3. Some by the
armes vnderstand the towers and fortresses of the citie, which are as the armes of it, <hi>Pintus.</hi>
But the armes are said to pollute the Sanctuarie: this cannot be properly vnderstood of the
towers. 4. <hi>Calvin,</hi> whom <hi>Geneuens.</hi> followe, by the armes thinketh to be meant the faction
of the wicked Iewes, that held with Antiochus, but they are spoken of in the next verse,
<hi>which shall wickedly breake the couenant.</hi> 5. Therfore by the armes are better vnderstood <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi>
Princes and captaines, whom he sent to spoile Ierusalem, <hi>Bulling. Melancth.</hi> as
<hi>Philippus</hi> a Phrygian, whom he left at Ierusalem, after the first taking of it, and <hi>Andronicus</hi>

the manner thereof.</head>
                        <p>Fowre wicked exploits done by <hi>Antiochus</hi> forces are expressed here. 1. they defiled the
Sanctuarie: for they entred into it, robbed, and spoiled it; as Antiochus had done before
himselfe: for he entred into the Temple <hi>Menelaus</hi> beeing his guide, and touched the holy
vessels with his owne hands, 2. Macchab. 5. 15. and carried them away, 1. Mac. 1. 23. 24.</p>
                        <p>2. They tooke also the citie, and the munition, the strong places thereof. Some referre
it to the Sanctuarie, thus reading the <hi>Sanctuarie of strength,</hi> so called, because it was situate
in a strong place, and had the tower of Dauid adioyning vnto it, <hi>Osiand.</hi> or because the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
fled thither as to a sure hold, when the citie was taken, <hi>Oecolamp.</hi> or because the people
put their confidence in the Temple, as the rocke of their defense, <hi>Bulling.</hi> or to put them in
minde that they should trust in God, who was yet their strength, although for their sinnes
he suffred his Temple to be defiled for a time, <hi>Calvin.</hi> But it is better vnderstood of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:18834:212"/>
which is called the munition, because of the strength thereof: for as <hi>Strabo</hi> writeth, <hi>lib.
16. Geograph.</hi> it was compassed with a strong wall of stone, and within was a ditch 60.
foote deepe, and 200. foote wide, made out of a rocke, the stone hewne out made the walls
about the Temple: <hi>Apollonius</hi> beeing sent to Ierusalem by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> was receiued peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
into the citie: but being entred he went vp and downe killing and slaying, sparing none:
but fell vpon the Iewes (hauing an armie of 22. thousand) vpon the Sabbath, while they
were keeping their feast, 2. Macchab. 5. 24. 25. <hi>Iun. Polan.</hi> as also they fortified the citie of
Dauid, with a great and thicke wall, and mightie towers, and set people to keepe it, and
brought in the spoyle of the citie thither, 1. Macchab. 1. 35. 36. this may be well vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
(the euent so fitly answering the prophesie) to be the munition or strong place here.</p>
                        <p>3. They caused the daily sacrifice to cease, that is, discontinued the seruice of God which
was celebrated by sacrifices in the Temple: one kind of sacrifice is taken for the rest: for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus
commanded that they should forsake their lawes, and he would haue them all
brought to an vniformitie, to liue according to the lawes of the heathen: likewise he enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
his captaines to forbid burnt offrings and sacrifices, and all manner of offrings in the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuarie:
this was accordingly done, as we may read, 1. Macchab. 1. 47.</p>
                        <p>4. Then they set vp the abhomination of desolation, which 1. some take for the souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
placed in garrison, who were addicted to abhominable idolatrie, and brought both the
citie and Temple to desolation, <hi>Iun. Pol.</hi> but the souldiers are before signified by the armes,
and this is one of their effects, to set vp the abhomination: and they were rather abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
not the abhomination it selfe. 2. some translate the word <hi>shamam,</hi> by an other sense: it
signifieth both to make desolate and to astonish: and so they read, they shall set vp the abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
<hi>which shall cause them to wonder, or astonish them, Pagnin. Vatab.</hi> they should
wonder to see the Temple so defiled and forsaken, <hi>Calvin.</hi> but that the word rather signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
here <hi>to make desolate,</hi> then <hi>to astonish,</hi> appeareth both by the former vse thereof, c. 9. v.
26. 27. for the further explication whereof I referre the Reader to the questions vpon that
place. 3. Some vnderstand nothing els here, but abhominable desolation, <hi>Bulling.</hi> but
that was signified before, <hi>they shall take away the daily sacrifice:</hi> and beside, the phrase of
<hi>setting vp</hi> sheweth, that there was somewhat actually set vp in deede. 4. <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth
it to the Romane ensignes and banners which were set vp in the Temple, and round
about: But this place is not vnderstood of the Romanes: <hi>Antiochus</hi> profanation of the
Temple is here described. 5. Wherefore this abhomination of desolation, or making deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
cannot be better vnderstood, then of those filthie idols which Antiochus and his cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
caused to be set vp in the Temple: as there was set vp vpon the altar, the abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
idol of <hi>Iupiter Olympius: Pellic. Melancth. Osiand. Lyran. Perer.</hi> for both idols are v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually
in Scripture called by that name, <hi>abominations,</hi> and the sequele and euent sheweth it
to be so vnderstood, as 1. Macchab. 1. 57. it is said, <hi>they set vp the abhomination of desolation
vpon the altar:</hi> there was then some abhominable thing in verie deede set vp vpon the altar.</p>

persons of the Iewes, that forsooke
the lawe.</head>
                        <p>1. The second kind of helpe which <hi>Antiochus</hi> vsed, was beside his captaines and souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
certaine wicked factious people among the Iewes: which were seduced by his flatterie
to betray their owne countrey. Such were wicked <hi>Iason,</hi> that entred into the citie with a
thousand men, and slue his owne citizens without mercie: and wicked <hi>Menelaus</hi> that was
himselfe a guide vnto Antiochus, and brought him into the Temple, to robbe and spoile it,
2. Macchab. 5. As these assisted Antiochus in his first taking of the citie: so afterward when
he sent <hi>Apollonius,</hi> diuerse of the people ioyned with him: as 1. Macchab. 1. 55. <hi>then went
many of the people vnto them by heapes, euerie one that forsooke the lawe.</hi> And after these
times such an one was <hi>Alcimus</hi> the high Priest, who came with <hi>Bacchides,</hi> the kings cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine:
the people trusted <hi>Alcimus,</hi> because he was the high Priest, and he sware vnto them,
that he would doe them no harme, but he tooke 60. men and killed them, 1. Mac. 7. 15. 16.</p>
                        <p>2. The other part of the verse is diuersly read. 1. <hi>Iunius</hi> and <hi>Polan.</hi> thus interpret, <hi>and the
people of those that knowe God, they shall apprehend,</hi> that is, the wicked apostataes shall betray
their owne brethren: but in this sense the word <hi>chazak</hi> is put with the preposition <hi>beth</hi> most
commonly: as Isay. 4. 1. and Zachar. 8. 13. as our English phrase is, <hi>to lay hold on,</hi> and the
word <hi>people,</hi> beeing set first, is rather the nominatiue then the accusatiue case, which for the
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:18834:213"/>
most part followeth the verbe in the Hebrewe tongue. 2. Therefore here I rather approoue
the receiued interpretation: that though many shall fall away, yet those among the people,
which feare and knowe God, shall encourage themselues, and goe on in their dutie: which is
the meaning of the last word: <hi>they shall doe,</hi> doe their part and office, <hi>Bulling. Melan. Calv.

                        <p>1. Concerning the first. 1. Some because mention is made here of instruction, will not
haue it here vnderstood of the persecution of the Iewes, in the time of the Macchabees, for
they were fighters rather then instructors: and therefore they thinke it more fitly to be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vnto the persecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the seruants of God in the times of the Apostles, as is declared in
the booke of the Acts: for then the Apostles ceased not to instruct the people and Church
of God, <hi>Oecolamp.</hi> 2. But though Mattathias and his sonnes were stirred vp to defend the
innocent by their valiant resisting of wicked <hi>Antiochus</hi> proceedings, yet they also instructed
and encouraged the people, and exhorted them to continue stedfast, as we may further see
1. Macchab. 2. and 2. Macchab. 8. 16. 21. And that this persecution is not that which the
historie of the Acts maketh mention of, is euident by this; that the Romanes and their agents
were then the persecutors: but here this Tyrant and persecutor was somewhat curbed by the
Romanes, as is before shewed v. 30. And for the same reason this cannot be referred vnto
the last destruction of Ierusalem by <hi>Vespasian</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> as some of the Hebrewes thinke.
3. Those then which instructed the people, were chiefely the faithfull Priests, the Maccha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees,
the father and his sonnes, 1. Macchab. 2. and other faithfull people are not excluded,
who did their part one instructing and encouraging an other.</p>
                        <p>2. Then it followeth, what they endured and suffred, euen all kind of most grieuous tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
by the sword, by flame, by captiuitie, by spoyle: how they were put to the sword,
when <hi>Apollonius</hi> with an armie of 22. thousand entred the citie, as is shewed, 2. Macchab.
5. 25. and the younger sort with the women were sold into captiuitie, v. 24. the spoile of
the citie is described, 1. Macchab. 1. 37. And how they were tried by the flames of fire and
other torments, is declared in that lamentable storie of the mother with her 7. children, how
cruelly they were put to death, 2. Macchab. 7. their skinne was fleyed off, their tongues cut
out, and their vtmost parts cut off: their flesh was boyled in hoate caldrons: The like report

God suffreth them to be afflicted, namely, to purge and trie them. 3. by the circumstance
of the time, which shall not continue, but so long onely as God hath appointed.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the first (for the other two parts are plaine enough) 1. the Hebrewes vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
this small helpe of some Emperours, which fauoured the Iewes, such were <hi>Seuerus</hi> and
<hi>Antoninus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. Some referre it vnto the time of <hi>Iulian,</hi> who gaue the Iewes libertie to build the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
againe: but he did it fainedly, for he intended thereby onely the aduancement of idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
and the defacing of Christian religion.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> interpreteth this little helpe of the fauour shewed by some Emperours
vnto the Christians, as <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> protected them: and by those, that should cleaue
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:18834:213"/>
vnto them fainedly, he vnderstandeth the heretikes, as <hi>Cherinthus, Menander,</hi> the <hi>Ebonites,</hi>
with other who ioyned with the Christians, yet were great enemies vnto the truth of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
religion: But all these opinions may be confuted by one and the same argument: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
here is a continuance of the same historie, from v. 30. he which was repelled by the
shippes of Chittim, which were the Romanes, is the same which persecuteth the Church
here: the Romanes are not these persecutors, but they somewhat bridled and stayed the
persecutor.</p>
                        <p>4. Some further applie this to the last times of persecution vnder Antichrist, that then
the Saints shall resist him, but by small helpe, <hi>Hierome.</hi> Indeede typically this Scripture
may be so applyed, but historically it was performed in the time of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> as <hi>Pererius</hi>
obserueth.</p>
                        <p>5. Wherefore here there is euident relation vnto the <hi>Macchabees,</hi> vnto <hi>Mattathias</hi>
and his sonnes, who beeing but an handfull and a small companie in respect of <hi>Antiochus,</hi>
and his armie; yet God so prospered this small helpe, that the tyrannie of Antiochus was
somewhat stayed for the time: and in the ende of the appointed time, after three yeares and
certaine dayes from the abolishing of the daily sacrifice, which beganne the 15. day of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleu,
in the 145. yeare 1. Mac. 1. 57. the Temple was cleansed on the 25. of the same moneth
in the 148. yeare, 1. Macchab 4. 52.</p>
                        <p>Now while this small helpe prospered, some as the text saith, did but cleaue fainedly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

                        <p>v. 36. <hi>And the king shall doe what him list, &amp;c.</hi> In this second persecution which Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus
mooued against the Iewes, which consisteth of three parts, first it hath beene shewed
what ministers and instruments he should vse: secondly, what the faithfull should endure
and suffer: now followeth the third part, what <hi>Antiochus</hi> himselfe should doe: And his acts
are either concerning religion, in abrogating all religion both true and false, v. 36. 37. and in
establishing a newe religion of his owne, v. 38. or such as concerne ciuill and politike mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
vers. 39.</p>
                        <p>But interpreters doe much differ in the exposition of this Scripture, of whom it should
be vnderstood. 1. The Hebrewes take this king to be Constantine the great: of whom <hi>Ab.
Ezra</hi> is not ashamed to tell these lies, that there were but 318. which receiued the Christian
religion, which afterward he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled all Princes and people to embrace: But all this is false:
he thinketh there were no more Christians but onely those 318. Bishops which were assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
in the Nicen Councel: neither did <hi>Constantine</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pell any to receiue the Christian faith,
but forbad the worship of Idols, and protected the Christian religion: but he was so farre
from lifting himselfe vp against God, that euerie where he commanded Churches to be ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to the honour of Christ, in whose name he ouercame his enemies. Some of the Iewes
vnderstand this king to be <hi>Vespasian;</hi> some an Emperour, that should rise vp after Iulian, who
seemed to fauour them: so well they agree together.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> and <hi>Melancthon,</hi> will haue this king to be the Pope and Turke, who
both are blasphemous against God: but the Prophet speaketh but of one king: neither is it
like that the Angell breaking off at the persecution vnder <hi>Antiochus,</hi> would immediately
ioyne the historie of such things, as should come to passe aboue a thousand yeare after: for
so many yeares and more came betweene <hi>Antiochus</hi> persecution, and the beginning of the
Monarchie of the Turke, and of the tyrannie of the Pope.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>M. Calvin</hi> thinketh this place not to be vnderstood of any one king, but of a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
gouernement: which he referreth to the Monarchie of the Romanes, not beginning at
<hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> but at such time as they beganne to oppresse Iudea: as first <hi>Pompey</hi> tooke the
citie, though he spared the Temple: after him <hi>Crassus</hi> spoiled and robbed the Temple: whose
insatiable couetousnesse was such in those countries, that he was hated of all: in so much that
when he was slaine they filled his skull full of gold, and carried it vp and downe in derision.
The Romanes exalted themselues against God: for they tooke vpon them to determine who
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:18834:214"/>
should be counted Gods: and <hi>Cicero</hi> in his oration <hi>pro Flacco,</hi> speaketh basely of the God
of the Iewes, not holding him worthie to be compared with Bacchus or Venus: and that
Iudea beeing so often ouercome, was hated of all the gods: T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>us <hi>M. Calv.</hi> But although
diuerse of these things here prophecied of may by way of analogie be applyed to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,
whose pride was into lerable, and their superstitious religion, a verie prophanesse:
yet they cannot well be vnderstood here: seeing at that time there was no king among the
Romanes: but here the Angel directly speaketh of a king: and the inuading of the citie by
<hi>Pompey</hi> was an 100. yeare and more after this: which distance of time, the continuance and
coherence of this storie will not admit.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Lyranius,</hi> with other writers of that side, <hi>Pererius,</hi> with the rest, and before him <hi>Hugo
Card.</hi> doe vnderstand this prophesie directly of that Antichrist whom they suppose shall
come in the end of the world, and raigne but 3. yeares and an halfe: and so <hi>Hugo</hi> a little
before expounded that little helpe of Henoch and Elias, which shall stand vp against Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ.
And to this purpose <hi>Pererius</hi> alleadgeth out of <hi>Hyppolitus,</hi> how Antichrist shall send
his mandates through the world, to call together people and nations to come to worshippe
him: who shall cause to be proclaimed in their hearing: <hi>quis Deus magnus praeter me, quis
potentiae meae resistet?</hi> who i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> so great a God as I, who is able to resist my power? &amp;c. But
that this deuise of some singular man, which shall stand vp in the ende of the world to be
Antichrist, is but a meere fiction, is afterward more at large declared among the controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
handled out of this chapter: And beside it is not like that the Angel would ioyne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
two stories so farre asunder.</p>
                        <p>5. Some other writers doe so vnderstand this of the verie Antichrist the Pope, as that
they apply it not to Antiochus at all: but thinke that Antichrist is properly described from
hence to the ende of the prophesie of Daniel, <hi>Osiander, Pappus.</hi> But it is one thing histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
to interpret a prophesie, an other typically to apply it.</p>
                        <p>6. Now then that all these things were historically performed by Antiochus, and are in
the intendement of the prophesie specially meant of him, thus it may be shewed:</p>
                        <p>1. The time, when all these things should be fulfilled, is expressed, c. 12. 11. the dayes are
summed to a 1290. dayes, that is, 3. yeares, 7. moneths, and about 13. dayes: therefore
this prophesie could not be put off so long.</p>
                        <p>2. The word <hi>hamelech,</hi> this king, hath reference to the former historie: and the article
<hi>ha,</hi> is a note of demonstration, pointing out the king before spoken of:</p>
                        <p>3. All the other expositions bring vs to a time farre distant and remoote, from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
historie of Antiochus; but these things here described followe, as the next in the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
of time.</p>
                        <p>4. Beside, the Angel in this propheticall narration satisfieth Daniels desire, which was to
knowe, what should befall his people: but these things as the other expound them, do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
concerne the Iewes: neither came they so much as into Daniels thought to enquire.</p>
                        <p>5. The sequele of the storie answeareth to the prophesie: for Antiochus did all this: he
aduanced himselfe aboue God, and spake blasphemous things against him, in defiling his
Temple, abrogating the sacrifices, burning the bookes of the lawe: he wrote also his letters,
that they should forbid the offrings and sacrifices, and defile the Sabbaths and feasts, and
pollute the Sanctuarie and the holy men, and to set vp altars, and groues, and chappels of i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols,
and to offer vp swines flesh and strange beasts, 1. Mac. 1. v. 47. to 51. and v. 57. 58.
Thus ti is euident that Antiochus magnified himselfe against God: see further <hi>Appendix</hi>

                        <p>Some take not this to be vnderstood at all of Antiochus, but doe otherwise apply it: the

saith not, he shall abrogate or denie the gods of his fathers, but he shall not regard them.</p>
                        <p>2. Some applie this vnto the Turke, who honoureth <hi>Mahomet</hi> before Christ the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
God of Christians, and preferreth Mahomets lawes before Christs: <hi>Melancth. Oecolamp.</hi>
But, as <hi>Calvin</hi> well noteth, <hi>voluit Deus sustinere animos suorum vsque ad Christi exhibitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi>
God in this prophesie doth intend onely the releefe and comfort of his, till Christ
should be exhibited.</p>
                        <p>3. The same reason may serue against their opinion, which thinke the Atheisme, irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and new worship brought in by the Popes to be here described: as <hi>Illyricus, lib. advers.
primat. Pap. Osiander, Bulling. Graser. exercit. 3. p.</hi> 185. all these shew how the Pope hath left
the auncient faith, and true worship of Iesus, in setting vp other Mediatours, and bringing in
traditions, making them equall, if not superiour to the lawes of Iesus Christ: so that in effect
he worshippeth Christ but in name and shew onely. All this may fitly be applied vnder the
type of Antiochus, to the Romane Antichrist, but there is difference betweene the histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
and typicall sense.</p>
                        <p>4. The Romanists, as <hi>Pererius, Vatablus,</hi> doe here dreame of their imagined Antichrist,
that shall come before the ende of the world, and grow into such pride, that he shall cause
himselfe onely to be worshipped, as God: But this their fantasticall conceit is reiected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
qu. 43. 4. and shall be at large confuted among the controversies.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi>Calvin</hi> vnderstandeth the Romane state, who daily inuented new gods, but in effect
cared for none: but at this time there was no king or Emperour of the Romanes: as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
here speaketh directly of a king, <hi>hamelech:</hi> the article set before the word sheweth, that
one particular king is meant.</p>
                        <p>6. Wherefore this was historically fulfilled in Antiochus: 1. not in that he profaned
the Temple and the God of the Iewes, whome Antiochus the great his father honoured, and
gaue vnto the Temple great immunities: <hi>Ioseph. lib. 12. c.</hi> 3. for the God of the Iewes was
not the God of his fathers, that were idolaters. 2. nor in compelling the Iewes not to set
by the honour of their fathers, 2. Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>chab. 4. 15. for this must be his owne act. 3. nor in
setting vp the gods of the Grecians, as <hi>Iuppiter, Bacchus, Hercules,</hi> which were not the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
gods: for all the Gentiles worshipped in effect the same idols, though vnder other
names. 4. But herein was his impietie and prophannes seene, that though he set vp the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols
of the heathen, and spared for no cost, in adorning them, and therein exceeded all his
predecessors, as <hi>Polybius in Athen.</hi> yet in effect he cared for no god: he was <hi>vacuus omni
numinis reverentia,</hi> void of all reuerence of the godhead: <hi>Iun. Pellic.</hi> and <hi>Graserus,</hi> who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth
all this to the Pope, denieth not but that in this sense it may be vnderstood of Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus.

                        <p>1. Some doe read these words affirmatiuely, that <hi>he shall be in the desires of women.</hi> And here
1. <hi>Pellican</hi> applieth it to <hi>Antiochus,</hi> that was <hi>luxuriosissimus,</hi> most lasciuious, in so much

that conceit of their Antichrist, the Iewes Messiah and that Antichrist shall come together.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Pererius</hi> thinketh, that the spirit of God of purpose left the Hebrew Scripture ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous,
that in both senses it might agree to Antichrist: for he secretly shall be giuen to all
lust, and yet outwardly feigne chastitie: but the Scripture vseth not to speake doubtfully.</p>
                        <p>3. Wherefore the best reading is negatiuely, <hi>he shall not haue respect to the desires of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>
1. which neither doe we take generally for his inhumanitie, becasue kindnes and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:18834:215"/>
is likened to the loue of women, 2. Sam. 1. 26. as <hi>Iunius</hi> referring it to Antiochus,
and <hi>Calvin</hi> to the Romanes, and some other to <hi>Herod</hi> that was cruell toward his wife and
children. 2. nor, becasue Antiochus regarded not the desire and request of his wife for
sparing the Temple: for the text speaketh of women, not of one woman. 3. nor yet is here
signified the tendernes of women, whome he cruelly put to death, not sparing their sex:
<hi>Bro.</hi> for the word <hi>chemidah,</hi> desire, is not taken in that sense. 4. nor yet is it meant, he
should altogether be alienated from the desire of women; as <hi>Vatablus</hi> doth, applying it to
their Antichrist. 5. But the word signifieth the lawfull desires of women: he shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne
matrimonie, and be giuen ouer to vagrant lust: and this to be the sense <hi>Graserus</hi>
sheweth by three arguments: 1. by the vse of the word, which is for the most part taken for
lawfull desire: as Daniel is called, a man of desires, Dan. 9. 23. and Ezekiels wife is called the
<hi>desire of his eyes,</hi> c. 24. 17. 2. the word signifieth a reflexion of desire: in desiring and beeing
desired: as 1. Sam. 9. 20. the desire of Israel was toward Saul: but this reflexion of desire is
onely seene in lawfull matrimonie. 3. the phrase sheweth so much, <hi>he shall not regard:</hi> as
before it signified not the abolishing of all gods, but a contempt of them: so here he shall
not altogether despise women, but he shall not regard their desire: he shall contemne matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie:
and so did Antiochus, who had a famous strumpet <hi>Antiochis,</hi> to whome he gaue the
cities of <hi>Tharsus</hi> and <hi>Mallot,</hi> 2. Macchab. 4. 30. <hi>Theodoret:</hi> and he openly ioyned himselfe to
strumpets: as <hi>Hierome.</hi> 6. This beeing thus literally true of Antiochus, may be applied ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pically
to the Pope, who hath brought in contempt of Matrimonie, &amp;c. but this is not the
historicall meaning, as <hi>Bulling. Osiand. Illyricus, Graserus</hi> doe thinke. 7. But <hi>Oecolampad.</hi> is
further off, who vnderstandeth this of Antiochus contempt of the beutiful goddesses, as the
Moone, or Venus: for the text speaketh of women, not of goddesses.</p>

sorted: some doe vnderstand these words of the false god, which shall be set vp: some of the

words <hi>Mauzzim,</hi> and <hi>Modin,</hi> there is small affinitie.</p>
                        <p>2. Some applie this vnto Antichrist, and thinke that he shall secretly worship the deuill,
whom he shall call the god of his defence, <hi>Lyran.</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth hereunto incline.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Theodoret</hi> thus expoundeth, that Antichrist shall call himselfe the god <hi>Mauzzim,</hi>
that is, a strong god: but it hath beene shewed sufficiently before, that this prophesie is hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storically
and literally vnderstood of Antiochus. And if it should be referred to Antichrist,
that he is himselfe this god <hi>Mauzzim,</hi> there can be made no sense of these words, <hi>he shall
worship the god Mauzzim in his place:</hi> for how can he be said to worship himselfe? here is
one that worshippeth, and an other that is worshipped.</p>
                        <p>4. Some vnderstand this prophesie of the Turke, and this god <hi>Mauzzim</hi> to be <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi>
whome the Turks adore with siluer and gold; and whose religion he maintaineth by
force and strength; still seeking to enlarge his Empire, and to subdue nations, which was one
of Mahomets speciall precepts and principles: and it is saide, he shall worship him in his
place, that is, according to his qualitie and dignitie, not as a God, but as a great Prophet:
thus one <hi>Christian Irenophil. ex Polan. Oecolampadius</hi> much varieth not, hauing reference
here vnto <hi>Mecca</hi> the temple of Mahomet, which is adorned with siluer and gold. But I haue
shewed, that this prophesie concerneth not the Turke, whose Monarchie beganne a 1000.
yeares after Antiochus: &amp; the affaires of the Turke did not belong to the state &amp; condition
of the Iewes the people of God then, for whose co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort specially this prophesie was penned.</p>
                        <p>5. M. <hi>Calvin</hi> still proceedeth, applying all this vnto the Romanes, that they had their
peculiar god <hi>Iuppiter Olympius,</hi> Iuppiter set vp in the Capitol, whome they made the chiefe
of all other gods: but in effect they onely magnified themselues, their power and riches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all other gods: And so farre as it was for their aduantage and profit, they did pretend
the name and worship of the gods: but in effect, they set vp altars, and offered sacrifice, <hi>suae
foelicitati &amp; fortunae,</hi> to their owne happines and fortune: so also <hi>Genevens.</hi> following <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin:</hi>
                           <pb n="429" facs="tcp:18834:215"/>
but this application to the Romane state we haue vpon diuers reasons refused before,
qu. 44.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi>Melancthon</hi> by the god <hi>Maosim,</hi> that is, of munitions, vnderstandeth the god <hi>vario<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
templorum,</hi> that was worshipped in diuers temples: for as the Iewes had but one Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
called before <hi>Maosa,</hi> v. 31. the <hi>Sanctuarie of strength:</hi> so the Gentiles had their <hi>Maosim,</hi>
their diuers temples, wherein they worshipped a number of gods: as the <hi>Athenians</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
<hi>Pallas,</hi> the <hi>Thebanes, Bacchus;</hi> the <hi>Eleusines, Ceres;</hi> the <hi>Sic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Iuno;</hi> they of <hi>Delphos, Phoebus;</hi> the <hi>Lemnians, Vulcan;</hi> the <hi>Lampsacenes, Priapus;</hi>
the <hi>Phrygians, Cybele:</hi> But M. <hi>Calvin</hi> doth not much weigh this distinction of the singular
and plural, for the word <hi>Maozim,</hi> he taketh it to be curious. And seeing <hi>Melancthon</hi> first
vnderstandeth this of Antiochus, it can not be shewed how he brought in all these gods:
and the text onely speaketh in the singular, of the god <hi>Mauzzim.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>7. Some doe properly vnderstand here the Pope the Romane Antichrist, and retaining
the word as a proper name <hi>Mauzzim</hi> doe specially applie it to the idolatrous sacrifice of
the Masse: <hi>Osiander</hi> maketh some allusion in the word <hi>Mauzzim,</hi> to the word Masse: <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon</hi>
obserueth that the word <hi>mazon,</hi> which signifieth foode or meate, hath some assini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
with <hi>Mauzzim,</hi> noting the Papists breaden god: but <hi>Oecolampad.</hi> refuseth this conceit,
because the word <hi>mazon</hi> is written without the letter <hi>ain,</hi> which the other word hath, <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linger</hi>
maketh this application, that <hi>Mauzzim</hi> which signifieth holds, may be taken for the
Temples, which they adorne with siluer and gold, and doe tie thereunto the corporall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of Christ: But all these are analogicall applications of this prophesie: we must seeke
for an historicall sense beside, which was to take place long before the Romane Antichrist
appeared in the world.</p>
                        <p>8. All these doe by the god <hi>Mauzzim,</hi> vnderstand a false god, which should be brought
in by this aduersarie here spoken of. <hi>Polychronius</hi> by the god <hi>Mauzzim,</hi> that is, of strength,
would haue signified the true god of Isreal, whome <hi>Antiochus</hi> at length was forced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
by the extremitie of his disease, and sent great gifts and presents to Ierusalem to the
Temple: But neither is mention made in the storie, 2. Macchab. 9. of any such gifts which he
sent, <hi>Oecolampad.</hi> and it is a strange god, not the true God, which Antiochus here is said to
worship with gold and siluer.</p>
                        <p>9. <hi>Iunius</hi> and <hi>Polanus</hi> doe concurre together, thus reading, <hi>as for the God of strength, in
his place he shall honour: he shall honour a god, whome his fathers knew not, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Polanus</hi>
will haue the first clause distinguished, because of the accent <hi>zakeph katon,</hi> which diuideth it
from the words following: so that they would haue the god <hi>Mauzzim</hi> here taken for the
true God, called the God of strength, <hi>Polan.</hi> or the God of <hi>munitions,</hi> that is, whose seate
was at Ierusalem, which is called in Scripture a citie of munition: <hi>Iun. commentar.</hi> But 1.
neither that accent, nor yet the imperfect distinction <hi>rebia,</hi> which is ouer the word <hi>maghu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zim,</hi>
or (as <hi>Montanus) mahuzim,</hi> are of such force wholly to suspend these words from the
clause following; but onely they make a little pause or stay, not diuiding the sense: for then
the words, <hi>leeloha maghuzim, the god Mauzzim,</hi> standing by themselues, should make no
sense at all. 2. And againe, the same word <hi>leeloha,</hi> God, is repeated in the next sentence: it
must therefore be taken in the same sense in both places: if in the latter, it might be transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<hi>and God, he shall honour, whome &amp;c.</hi> it must be so taken in the first place: <hi>and the god
Mauzzim,</hi> or <hi>of munitions:</hi> not, <hi>as for the God:</hi> the preposition <hi>lamed</hi> must haue the like
vse in both places: and this reason chiefly maketh me to dissent from these learned men
in this place.</p>
                        <p>10. Wherefore I rather condescend to that other interpretation of <hi>Melancthon,</hi> that
<hi>Mauzzim</hi> signifieth not onely strength, but an hold, munition, a place of defence: and so
<hi>Antiochus</hi> after he had set vp the idol of <hi>Iuppiter Olympius</hi> in the Temple, he built a strong
tower or place of defence, neare vnto the Temple, where he set a garrison, to force the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to worship that idol: so the author of the Scholasticall historie interpreteth, <hi>Maozim
praesidium sonat, &amp; Antiochus in Ierusalem praesidium posuit,</hi> Maozim signifieth an hold or
garrison, and so Antiochus set garrisons in Ierusalem: <hi>Lyranus</hi> taketh <hi>Mauzzim</hi> for a strong
place, where Antichrist shall worship his idol: <hi>Vatablus</hi> by the <hi>god of strength,</hi> vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the idol, <hi>cuius fortitudini tribuet acceptum imperium,</hi> to whose fortitude he shall as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe
his Empire &amp; dominion, which he had obtained. But I preferre rather the former sense
for these two reasons: 1. because an other word by way of explanation is added to <hi>Mauz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zim,</hi>
                           <pb n="430" facs="tcp:18834:216"/>
which signifieth holds: he shall make or set <hi>in the holds, Mauzzim, munitions with a
strange god,</hi> v. 39. 3. The historie hereunto agreeth, how they built a strong wall and
made towers in the citie of Dauid, which was neere vnto the Temple: and so they were
an ambushment to the Sanctuarie, 1. Macchab. 1. 35. 38. This god of munitions then was
<hi>Iuppiter Olympius,</hi> whome Antiochus caused to be set vp in the Temple at Ierusalem, and to
be called by the name of that idol, 2. Macchab. 6. 2. which idol he garded with munitions,
worshipped with siluer and gold: which was a strange god, because the Syrians worshipped
other gods, and goddesses, as <hi>Apollo, Diana, Atargates: Strabo lib. Geogra. 16. Iuppiter O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympius</hi>
was the idol of the Greekes, which was not knowne in these places before: at the
least neuer set vp in the Temple at Ierusalem, by any of Antiochus predecessours: so foure
things are here declared concerning this abominable idol: 1. he shall be garded with muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
2. he shall be set vp in <hi>his place,</hi> that is, in the seat and place of the true God of Israel.
3. it shall be a strange idol, not knowne in that countrey before. 4. he shall honour him
with siluer and gold.</p>

                        <p>This wicked and subtill Tyrant hauing brought in a new Idol, vseth two meanes for the
establishing of this new come image: first he by force, planting garrisons, and fortifying
strong holds, seeketh to defend his false worship; then by rewards, honours, preferments, he
inticeth base fellows to maintaine his idolatrie: but first the meaning of the words must be
examined, and then the accomplishment and fulfilling thereof shewed.</p>
                        <p>1. Some doe ioyne both the parts of the verse together, and make this the sense; <hi>thus
shall he doe to the strong garrisons, that shall defend his strange god:</hi> he shall giue rewards,
honours, and preferments, <hi>Melancth. Oecolampad. Osiand.</hi> but beside, that the distinction
<hi>rebia</hi> doth diuide the first part of the sentence from the latter, the words themselues will
not beate this sense: for it is said, <hi>he shall diuide the land for a price,</hi> not freely: but to his sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
and garrisons he gaue rewards freely, yea he gaue them a yeares pay before hand, 1.
Macchab. 3. 27.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>M. Calvin</hi> readeth thus, <hi>faciet adversus munitiones fortitudinum, &amp;c.</hi> he shall doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the strong munitions with a strange god: that is, preuaile, &amp;c. which he vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
of the prosperous successe of the Romanes, who shall preuaile and ouercome by this
their strange god; that is, by their owne power and strength, which they shall magnifie as a
god. But beside that the Romanes are not here vnderstood at all, this sense is contrarie to
the scope of the text: for he shall preuaile by these strong holds, not against them.</p>
                        <p>3. The vulgar Latine readeth thus, <hi>and he shall cause to fortifie Maozim with a strange
god,</hi> that is, as <hi>Lyranus</hi> expoundeth, he shall fortifie the place, when he worshippeth this
strange god; applying it to Antichrist: but although this sense be not much to be misliked,
the words are not well translated: for the word <hi>lemibizere,</hi> is a noune put in the plural num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and not a verb, and signifieth holds, munitions, forts, not to fortifie.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Bullinger</hi> thus interpreteth, <hi>faciet, scilicet praedicta,</hi> he shall doe, that is to say the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
things, with siluer and gold, <hi>in the holds,</hi> that is, the temples of <hi>Maozim, with a strange
god,</hi> in setting forth the worship of this strange god: to this purpose also the English tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slations,
<hi>thus shall he doe in the holds of Maozim, B. G.</hi> But these make here <hi>Maozim</hi> a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
name of the idol, which rather is a name appellatiue, and signifieth holds or garrisons,
as is shewed in the former question: and it is euident, that <hi>Maozim</hi> is a diuers thing from
the strange god here spoken of.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi>Bullinger</hi> deliuereth this as an other sense; he shall doe in the holds of Maozim, as
the Gentiles vsed to doe with their strange gods: But this strange god here is the same,
which before he called the god of Maozim, which is Antiochus new idol, which he
set vp.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi>Iunius</hi> thus readeth, <hi>he shall commit the munitions of the (God) of strength vnto a
strange god:</hi> so also M. <hi>Br.</hi> and <hi>Polanus</hi> agreeth, sauing that he inserteth not (God) as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doe: and they make this the sense, that Antiochus shall commit the custodie of the
strong holds of Iudea vnto <hi>Iuppiter Olympius,</hi> as though he had vanquished the mightie
God of Iudea himselfe. But it seemeth, that he had more confidence in his munitions and
fortified places, then in his strange god: and that he committed this new god to the custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
and defence of them, rather then strong places to him.</p>

set the idoll of <hi>Iuppiter Olympius,</hi> 1. Macchab. 1. 35, 36. as <hi>Hugo Card.</hi> well obserueth: and

6. 2.</p>
                        <p>For the second part of the verse: 1. for this clause, <hi>whome he knoweth,</hi> some copies of the
vulgar Latine haue, <hi>whome he knoweth not:</hi> which translation <hi>Vatablus</hi> and <hi>Pintus</hi> set
downe: but there is no negatiue in the originall. 2. some referre this clause, <hi>whome he
knoweth,</hi> vnto Antiochus, that is, the idoll which he approoueth, and chooseth, <hi>Lyran. Hug.
Melancth. Calv. Papp.</hi> with others: but it is said before, that he should not care for any god:
he acknowledgeth none at all. 3. <hi>Iunius</hi> giueth this sense, those whome he knoweth, that
is, fauoureth, and seeth to further his wicked deuise, them he shall honour: so also <hi>Polanus.</hi>
4. But the better sense seemeth to be this; that him, which acknowledgeth this idoll, and
yeeldeth himselfe to this abomination, him will he honour. <hi>Vatabl. Bulling.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The last words, <hi>he shall diuide the land for a price,</hi> are diuersly interpreted: 1. the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
Latine readeth, <hi>gratuito,</hi> he shall diuide the land freely: so <hi>Lyran. Hug. Osiand. Papp</hi>
but the originall hath <hi>bimchir,</hi> in a price. 2. some read, <hi>loco pretij,</hi> he shall diuide the land
<hi>in stead of a price, Iun.</hi> but the word is <hi>in a price,</hi> that is, for <hi>a price.</hi> 3. the best reading is,
<hi>for a price, Bulling. Calv. Vatab. Polan.</hi> so also the <hi>Septuag. (for gifts,) non gratuito,</hi> not
freely, or <hi>gratis. Pellican.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For the accomplishment hereof: 1. <hi>Lyranus</hi> thinketh that this can not be vnderstood
of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> for he had no lands to distribute, hauing little beside the kingdome of Syria:
But this is vnderstood of the diuiding of Iudea, which now was in Antiochus hand. 2. <hi>M.
Calvin</hi> vnderstandeth it of the Romanes, who tooke great summes of the kings, whome
they subdued, to retaine their dignities, as of <hi>Philip</hi> king of Macedon, whome they had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome
before. 3. But the historie of the Macchabees sheweth euidently, that all these
things here prophesied, were so done by <hi>Antiochus:</hi> for so he bestowed the office of the
high Priest for money, first <hi>Iason</hi> bought it, and he was defraueded thereof by <hi>Menelaus,</hi>
who carrying the money obtained the Priesthood for himselfe, 2. Macchab. 4. And three
things Antiochus is said here to bestow, honours, authoritie, possessions: which accordingly
he did, distributing vnto the Apostatate Iewes the dignities, offices, and lands in diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Iudea: <hi>Polan.</hi> see it accomplished 1. Macchab. 3. 35, 36.</p>

                        <p>There are two parts of this narration: 1. what countries he shall inuade, v. 40, 41. and
what countries shall be free. First, he shall set vpon Egypt, beeing prouoked by the king
thereof, and shall come against him with an huge armie both by sea and land, v. 40. then he
shall enter into the land of Iudea, called the pleasant land, v. 41. Secondly, the nations which

the king of the South, and the North. 2. of the pleasant land. 3. of <hi>Edom, Moab,</hi>
and <hi>Ammon,</hi> which escaped. 4. of <hi>Lybia</hi> and <hi>Aethiopia</hi> that helped: of all these, how
they should be taken, there are diuers opinions.</p>
                        <p>1. Some doe vnderstand all this of the Antichrist, who, as they imagine, shall come in the
end of the world. 1. he shalbe that king of the North, who shal first subdue Egypt. 2. and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he shal inuade Iudea, called the pleasant, or glorious la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, because of the miracles which were

countreys. 4. he shall take also Lybia and Aethiopia, which shall first of all be subiect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, <hi>Hierome, Lyran, Perer.</hi> But this exposition of such a singular Antichrist hath beene
refused before, vpon these two reasons. 1. because the Angel prophesieth onely of such
things as should befall the people of the Iewes, for whom Daniel was so soliicitous and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
2. that there shall be no such singular Antichrist, whom they suppose to be one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
person, is shewed afterward, controv. 2.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>M. Calvin</hi> giueth this interpretation: 1. that the king of the South and the North
shall encounter with the Romanes: for so <hi>Mithridates</hi> and <hi>Tigranes</hi> in the North, had long
warre with the Romanes: and <hi>Cleopatra</hi> with <hi>Antonie</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> fought a great battell with
<hi>Augustus.</hi> 2. the Romanes shall preuaile and inuade Iudea also. 3. But the hillie countreys
of <hi>Moab, Edom, Ammon,</hi> shall escape them, or they shall not greatly regard them. 4. the
Romanes also shall conquer the <hi>Lybians</hi> and <hi>Aethiopians.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But this exposition cannot stand. 1. because the kings of the North and South doe not
ioyne together, but it is said, the king of the North <hi>shall come against him,</hi> that is, against
the king of the South. 2. here is no mention made of any third king or power, beside the
king of the North and South: and he that is the king of the North, is said to doe all that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
in the next verses, v. 41. <hi>he shall enter into the pleasant land,</hi> v. 42. <hi>he shall stretch forth
his hands,</hi> that is, the king of the North shall doe all this.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Bullinger</hi> thus interpreteth. 1. by the king of the North and South he vnderstandeth
the Turkes and Saracenes which should come from the North and South, with huge armies
of footemen, and horses, and strong shippes. 2. <hi>They shall inuade the pleasant land, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
shall falk</hi> which he referreth to the holy warres decreed against the Turke, by <hi>Gregor.</hi> 2. in
the Councell of <hi>Claromont,</hi> which was the occasion of the ruine and ouerthrowe of many.
3. <hi>Edom, Moab,</hi> and <hi>Ammon,</hi> that is the people inhabiting those countreys, shall ioyne
themselues vnto the Turkes and <hi>Saracenes,</hi> and so be free. 4. The <hi>Lybians</hi> also and <hi>Aethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opians,</hi>
shall be confederate with the Turkes: who shall ouercome Egypt, and expell the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane
thereof, which was brought to passe by <hi>Selymus</hi> the great Truke.</p>
                        <p>But these exceptions likewise may be here taken. 1. that this prophesie beginning with
Antiochus, is not like to end with the Turke, and so the space of a thousand yeares comming
betweene, should be left vntouched. 2. the kings of the North and South are not here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates,
but they one fight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with an other. 3. the names of <hi>Moab, Edom, Ammon,</hi> and
their generation were extinguished before the Turkes Monarchie beganne: this prophesie
then cannot be extended so farre, but must be restrained to those times, while these names
and nations continued.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Osiander</hi> and <hi>Pappus,</hi> 1. by the king of the North vnderstand the Romane Antichrist:
by the king of the South, Christ: for as from the North they say commeth all euill: so from
the South that which is good: and thus the king of the South, that is Christ, hath raised vp
from time to time diuerse of his saithfull seruants, which haue opposed themselues to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ.
2. by the pleasant land is vnderstood the Church, which Antichrist shall continually
afflict. 3. <hi>Edom</hi> signifieth redde, <hi>Moab</hi> the father, <hi>Ammon</hi> my people: and these three sorts
shall be free from the corruptions of Antichrist: the martyrs that are made redde with their
blood: they which depend onely vpon the mercies of God the father: and the first of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
that is, infants which are as the first fruites of the people of God. 4. And though
the Popes authoritie be not receiued in <hi>Lybia, Aegypt, Aethiopia,</hi> yet he challengeth iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
ouer them all, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>But this exposition also faileth: 1. the king of the North and South are literally to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,<note place="margin">See more Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix exercis. 7. argum. 3.</note>
as before in the rest of this chapter: and who seeth not how improperly Christ is said to
be king of the South: if the Pope of Rome be the king of the North, Christ borne in Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem
which is not South, but East to Rome, is vnfitly called king of the South: And seeing
he is king of all the world, his kingdome must not be restrained to the South. 2. by the
pleasant land Iudea is vnderstood here as also before, v. 16. 3. as Egypt and other countreys
are here vnderstood literally for the nations so called, so likewise must Edom, Moab, and
Ammon be taken. 4. <hi>Lybia</hi> and <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> which neuer yet receiued the Pope, are verie
improperly said to be in subiection to him.</p>
                        <p>5. It remaineth then, that all this was historically fulfilled in <hi>Antiochus.</hi> 1. the occasion

                        <p>3. But he spared the <hi>Edomites, Moabites,</hi> and <hi>Ammonites,</hi> because they tooke his part
against them, and much molested the Iewes: and therefore Iudas Macchabeus did fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

cities, and put them to the sword, 2. Macchab. 5. <hi>Ioseph. lib. 12. antiqu. c.</hi> 11.</p>
                        <p>4. The <hi>Lybians</hi> also and <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> which before were on <hi>Philometors</hi> side, beeing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured

                        <p>But thus it is argued against this exposition. 1. <hi>Porphyrie</hi> who literally vnderstandeth
this prophesie of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> saith that these things happened in his 11. yeare, whereas in
the beginning of that yeare he died farre from home in Persia, <hi>Perer.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. After the Romanes by their Embassadour <hi>Popilius</hi> had discharged <hi>Antiochus</hi> out of
Egypt, he neuer returned thither againe, <hi>Perer.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Antiochus</hi> neuer subdued the countreys of <hi>Lybia,</hi> and <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> as here it is said of
this king, <hi>Hierome.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. Neither had <hi>Antiochus</hi> all countreys in subiection vnto him, onely these three excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
of <hi>Edom, Moab, Ammon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Though these things were not done in the 11. yeare of <hi>Antiochus</hi> as <hi>Porphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
thinketh, who was therein deceiued, yet this letteth not but that this prophesie was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
in <hi>Antiochus:</hi> these things might fall out two yeares after he had set vp idolatrie, and
some two yeares or thereabout before his death, <hi>Iun. annot.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. Though Antiochus did forbeare to invade Egypt, after that discharge by way of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilitie
and conquest, yet he might and did affoard his helping hand to one of the brothers
against the other: which might be taken for no breach of his promise made vnto the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes
to depart out of Egypt.</p>
                        <p>3. Neither doth the text say, that he subdued <hi>Lybia,</hi> and <hi>Aethiopia;</hi> but as <hi>Hierome</hi> saith
he passed thorough or by them: and <hi>Hierome</hi> himselfe giueth this satisfaction, that when E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt

                        <p>4. Neither are all the countreys of the world here spoken of: for neuer any Conqueror

which he sang, &amp;c. concerning the words of Cush the sonne of Iemini:</hi> which he taketh to be
vnderstood of Saul the king, who is called <hi>Cush,</hi> because of his euill and cruell conditions:
Now for the meaning of this place, there are diuerse opinions. 1. Some thinke that this
is vnderstood of <hi>Chushai</hi> Dauids friend, who opposed himselfe to the counsell of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitophel:</hi>
of this opinion are <hi>Basil, Chrysostome, Theodoret, Euthymius,</hi> with others: but
this cannot be so:</p>
                        <p>1. His name is <hi>Cushat,</hi> with other letters and prickes, this is <hi>Cush.</hi> 2. that <hi>Cushai</hi> was an
<hi>Archite,</hi> that is, of Beniamin. 3. he was Dauids friend, but this was Dauids enemie, of
whom he complaineth in this Psalme.</p>
                        <p>2. An other opinion is, that this <hi>Cush</hi> was <hi>Saul,</hi> because he was of <hi>Iemini,</hi> that is, of the
tribe of <hi>Beniamin:</hi> Thus expoundeth <hi>Ionathas</hi> the Chalde paraphrast: as though <hi>Cush</hi> should
be here taken for <hi>Cis</hi> the father of Saul: of the same opinion that Saul is here vnderstood, are
<hi>Hierome,</hi> whom followe herein <hi>Raynerus, Isidor. Brixianus, Iansenius, Vatablus, Pintus,</hi>
with others: But this we refuse also: for when the word is taken for a Cushite or Aethiopian,
it is <hi>Cushi,</hi> not <hi>Cush:</hi> for so the Hebrewes ende their gentile names in I: so <hi>Cushi</hi> signifieth a
Cushite or Aethiopian, Ierem. 13. 23.</p>
                        <p>3. Some doe here referre vs to <hi>Shemei,</hi> that cursed Dauid, 2. Sam. 16. <hi>Genevens.</hi> as
though he should be called by another name, beside Shemei: but there beeing no such thing
mentioned in Scripture, I leaue it as a bare coniecture.</p>
                        <p>4. Wherefore it is more like, that this <hi>Cush</hi> was some other of Sauls followers that gaue
in false information of him vnto Saul: as Dauid complaineth of such vnto Saul himselfe, 1.
Sam. 24. 10. wherefore giuest thou an care to mens words that say, <hi>Behold Dauid seeketh
euill against thee, Iun.</hi>

                        <p>In this last part of this propheticall narration, there are first shewed the signes and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners
of this cruell Tyrants ende and sudden destruction: secondly, his ende and ruine it
selfe: there ate three signes which went before, as ominous accidents. 1. the rumors
which he heard from the East and the North. 2. his indignation and furie thereuppon. 3.
the planting of his tabernacle in the holy mount. 4. then followeth his finall ruine.</p>
                        <p>1. What these rumors should be, there are diuerse opinions. 1. <hi>Hierome</hi> vnderstandeth
it of the fame and rumor of warres, which should be raised by the faithfull and Chrstian
people against Antichrist in the ende of the world: But such an Antichrist to be one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
person to come in the ende of the world, hath no ground in Scripture: neither is the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment
hereof to be deferred so long vnto the ende of the world.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>M. Calvin</hi> still continueth his interpretation of the Romane state: these rumors which
troubled them, were the euill newes which was brought them, how <hi>Crassus</hi> was vanquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at <hi>Carras,</hi> and <hi>Antonie</hi> also after that, was there foyled with all the power of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes:
But this text speaketh of one particular man, whose ende is described: it cannot be
referred then to a whole state or Monarchie.</p>
                        <p>3. These rumors, M. <hi>Bullinger</hi> thinketh, to be the tydings brought to the Romane An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist,
concerning the warres of the Turke: whereupon <hi>Gregor.</hi> the 2. combined all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
princes to ioyne together against the common enemie the Turke, which was the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of those long and bloodie warres, called the holy warres.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="435" facs="tcp:18834:218"/>
4. <hi>Osiander</hi> and <hi>Pappus</hi> vnderstanding here also the Romane Antichrist, by these rumors
thinke to be meant the preaching of the Gospel, which beganne in the parts of Germanie,
which are East and North vnto Rome: But though this prophesie analogically may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
to Antichrist, yet there is another historicall meaning, as shall be shewed afterward.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi>Melancthon</hi> will haue the Turke here to be described, who shall be terrified with ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors:
that is, whereas by humane force he could not be resisted, the Lord from heauen shall
stay his rage: But we must not deferre the fulfilling of this prophesie so long: it serued spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
for the comfort of those times.</p>
                        <p>6. These rumors then were the tidings of warres which were brought vnto <hi>Antiochus,</hi>
and drewe him out of Egypt: these rumors from the East, were of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> which
inuaded his kingdome; and from the north, of the Romanes whose nauies and shippes were
in the coasts of <hi>Cilicia: Iun. annot.</hi> who in his commentarie thinketh that these rumours
were onely of the ouerthrowe of his captaines in Iudea, while he was in Persia: the newes
whereof was brought him both to <hi>Persepolis</hi> which was in the East, and to <hi>Ecbatane</hi> in the
North, 2. Macchab, 9. 2. 3. <hi>Porphyrius</hi> by these rumors vnderstandeth the fame of warres
which were intended against him from the East, by <hi>Artaxias</hi> king of <hi>Armenia:</hi> But <hi>Pola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
better ioyneth these together: that first the rising of the Parthians and Persians troubled
him, which was the cause that brought him into that countrey; and beeing there he was
much more vexed, hearing of the euill successe that his captaines <hi>Timotheus</hi> and <hi>Bacchides</hi>
had in Iudea, whom Iudas Macchabeus vanquished, and slewe at one time 20. thousand of
their armie: see 2. Macchab. 8. 30. and c. 9. 3.</p>
                        <p>2. The second precedent of Antiochus ruine, was his great wrath and indignation, with
the which he went forth and destroyed many. But this is likewise diuersely interpreted. 1.
<hi>Hierome</hi> vnderstands it of Antichrists rage, against those which shal not receiue his decrees:
so also <hi>Pererius. 2. M. Calvin</hi> of <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> who ouercame the Parthians, and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
that which <hi>Antonie</hi> had lost. 3. <hi>M. Bullinger</hi> of the combination made by Pope <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie</hi>
2. whetting and stirring vp Christian Princes to take in hand the warres for the holy
land. 4. <hi>Osiander</hi> of the cruell rage of Antichrist against the preachers of the gospell, <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
with others, the rumor whereof troubled him. 5. <hi>Melancthon</hi> of the rage of the Turke.
6. <hi>Porphyrius</hi> of the ouerthrowe, which Antiochus gaue to <hi>Artaxia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

also the <hi>Aradians</hi> and <hi>Phenicians</hi> in the way. 7. But the euent of this prophesie
sheweth, that this cruell rage of Antiochus was but against the Iewes, intending to make
an vtter destruction and desolation of them, as is declared 1. Macchab. 3. 27. <hi>when king
Antiochus heard these tidings, he was angrie in his minde, wherefore he sent forth and gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
all the power of his realme, a verie strong armie:</hi> and what he intended against them, is

whom <hi>Theodoret</hi> followeth, taking <hi>Apadno</hi> to be the name of a place neere to Ierusalem,
where Antichrist shall be ouerthrowne: But it is euident, that the word <hi>tzebi,</hi> glorious, is
here no proper name, as before it is an epithite giuen vnto Iudea: and as <hi>Hierome</hi> noteth, <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phadno</hi>
is compounded of two words, <hi>aphad,</hi> which signifieth a throne, and <hi>no,</hi> his.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Hierome</hi> therefore giueth this sense, whom <hi>Lyranus, Pintus, Pererius</hi> followe, that
Antichrist shall pitch his tabernacle in Iudea, betweene the two Seas, the dead Sea, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean
Sea: in the holy mountaine, mount Sion or mount Oliuer, where Christ ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
where Antichrist shall be ouerthrowne: of which mountaine <hi>Hierome lib. de locis he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braic.</hi>
telleth two strange things: that in mount Oliuet in his time were to be seene the print
of Christs feete on the ground, where he last stood, when he ascended; and beside in the same
place where Christ is thought to haue ascended, there is a Church, which will not endure a
roofe or couering vpon it. But I will leaue the credit of these strange reports to those, which
haue seene those countreys, which doe finde no such thing: either <hi>Herome</hi> might be too cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous
in reporting such things, or some forging finger hath thrust it in: If this report haue
no more truth, then that other conceit of Antichrists spreading his palace in mount Oliuet,
they are both meere fables.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Porphyrius</hi> taketh these two Seas to be Tigris and Euphrates, and <hi>Apadno</hi> to be the
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:18834:219"/>
name of a place betweene those riuers: and this mountaine he thinketh to be in <hi>Elymais, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia,
or Mesopotamia,</hi> where <hi>Antiochus</hi> pitched his pauilion: But though this prophesie
were historically fulfilled in Antiochus, wherein he gesseth right: yet the other are but his
fansies, by two Seas to vnderstand two riuers: and why should any such hill among the ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
Persians be called holy, vnles he thinke it were for the superstitious adoration of some
Gentile idols there: which the spirit of God would neuer in that respect haue called holy.</p>
                        <p>4. Some applying this to the Turke, doe shewe how his seate at <hi>Constantinople</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the two Seas <hi>Aegeum</hi> and <hi>Euxinum,</hi> where sometime the Church of God was,
called the holy mountaine, <hi>Melancthon. M. Calvin</hi> sheweth how the Romanes set their
palace and dominion in those countreys, and especially in Iudea, after they had quieted those
parts: But this prophecie was not deferred so long, as to reach vnto the Turkes: and it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that some singular person is here described, whose ende is foreshewed: therefore not
the whole state of the Romanes.</p>
                        <p>5. Some doe interpret it of the Romane Antichrist, whose seate is betweene the two
Seas, <hi>Tyrrhenum,</hi> and <hi>Adriaticum:</hi> and they thinke Rome to be called the holy mountaine,
because sometime there Paul planted a famous Church, <hi>Osiand. Pappus.</hi> But though this by
way of application may be referred to Antichrist, that is not the originall and historicall
sense: and it seemeth to be somewhat hard, to call the seate of Antichrist great Babylon, the
citie of abhominations, the holy mountaine.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> likewise here vnderstanding Antichrist, taketh this holy mountaine
for the Church of God, which was prefigured by Iudea, which was situate betweene the
two Seas, the dead Sea, and the mediterrane sea: But it is euident that the glorious moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
is here taken for Iudea, as it is called before the beautifull or glorious land, v. 16. 41.</p>
                        <p>7. <hi>Iunius</hi> in his commentarie taketh <hi>Apadno</hi> for <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> for he saith that countrey
was called <hi>Apadan:</hi> as <hi>Theodotian</hi> retaineth the same word <hi>Apadon,</hi> and there <hi>Antiochus</hi>
pitched his pauilion betweene the Seas, among the Chalde fennes: and <hi>in the holy mountaine</hi>
he interpreteth, <hi>when they went against the holy mountaine,</hi> that is Iudea, which was an hilly
countrey: And this may seeme some probabilitie hereof, because the word <hi>padan</hi> is taken
for Mesopotamia in Scripture, which commeth somewhat neere the word <hi>aphadno:</hi> But the
two seas cannot properly be said to be fennes: And the verie description of the holy moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
betweene the two Seas, sheweth that Iudea is vnderstood by the right situation
thereof.</p>
                        <p>8. Some doe thinke, that Antiochus himselfe returning out of Persia, was entring into
the borders and confines of Iudea, when he was stricken of God: and then he pitched his
princely tents betweene the <hi>dead sea,</hi> and the <hi>Mediterranean:</hi> so <hi>Polanus</hi> out of <hi>Iosephus,</hi>
who thus writeth, that Iudas Macchabeus, <hi>eum in sines Iudaeae ingredientem, vehementissima
plaga percussum, repressit, &amp;c.</hi> did recoile him or driue him backe entring into the borders
of Iudea, beeing striken with a great plague, &amp;c. <hi>lib. 1. de bello Iudaic. c.</hi> 1. But this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
stand with that report, 1. Macchab. 9. 4. that Antiochus fell sicke in Babylon, and their
died: he was dead then before he came neere Iudea: and he could not spread his tents there
after he was returned from Persia: wherefore either <hi>Iosephus</hi> writeth here somewhat loosely
and slenderly of this matter, as he doth elsewhere: or he speaketh of some other foyle that
Iudas gaue vnto Antiochus, and not at that time, when he had beene in Persia.</p>
                        <p>9. Wherefore the meaning is this, that not Antiochus should pitch his pauilion in his
owne person, but his viceroy <hi>Lysias,</hi> with whom he had left his sonne <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and halfe
of his armie, and made him gouernour in his absence of all his kingdome from Euphrates to
the borders of Egypt: then he pitched in <hi>Emmaus</hi> with the kings forces, 1. Macchab. 3. v.
32. 40. <hi>H. Br. in Daniel.</hi> which was since called <hi>Nicopolis:</hi> which though it be said to be
in the plaine, yet there the hilly tract beginneth, that extendeth to Ierusalem, the mount O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuet
not beeing aboue a mile from <hi>Emmaus, Lyran. Hugo.</hi> the two Seas are the dead Sea
and the Mediterranean Sea, which are the limites of Iudea, <hi>Iun.</hi>

Antiochus.</head>
                        <p>v. 45. <hi>He shall come to his ende, and none shall helpe him. 1. Hierome</hi> thus deliuereth the
sense, that Antichrist shall goe vp to the toppe of mount Oliuet: for so he readeth, <hi>veniet ad
summitatem eius,</hi> he shall <hi>come to the height thereof:</hi> that is, of mount Oliuet, whereon he
shall be confounded: And this he would prooue by that place, Isay, 25. 7. <hi>I will destroy in
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:18834:219"/>
this mountaine the couering, that couereth all people, &amp;c.</hi> But the meaning of this place is,
that Christ, of whom the Prophet there speaketh, (who shall prepare a spirituall feast, which
is mentioned in the former verse, by the preaching of the gospell) shall remoue the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of ignorance and darkenesse, which had ouerspread the world: And the Prophet there
nameth not mount Oliuet, but hath reference to that mount spoken of, c. 24. 23. which was
mount Sion: a figure of the Church, which should be illuminate with the knowledge of
Christ. 2. and the text speaketh not of the ende of the mountaine, but of Antiochus ende,
when his time was come which was limited of God.</p>
                        <p>2. Some proceed yet further, and shew the manner how Antichrist shall be ouerthrown:
that first he shall faine himselfe dead, and rise againe the third day, and then vpon mount O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuet
he shall make as though he would ascend into heauen, and so shall be lifted vp into the
aire by the helpe of the deuill and his Angels: at which instant he shal be destroyed by Christ
from heauen, by the spirit of his mouth, as the Apostle speaketh, 2. Thess. 2. <hi>Percrius,</hi> Some
adde further the particular manner how Antichrist shall be destroyed: as the author of the
scholasticall historie saith, <hi>ascendente per aera Antichristo, audietur vox Christi de coelo missa,
morcre: as Antichrist is ascending into the aire, there shall come a voice from heauen, die, and
presently he shall be smitten with lightening and perish:</hi> so also <hi>Lyran.</hi> But <hi>Lactantius</hi> is yet
more bold, who thus describeth the destruction of Antichrist: that he with an huge armie
shall compasse about the Saints in a mountaine, whether they fled, then they shall call vpon
God for his helpe: And presently the heauens shall open, and lightening shall breake forth:
and this shallbe a signe of the Lords descending, <hi>cadet repente gladius,</hi> a sword shall sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fall from heauen: and then Antichrist shall be ouercome by the Angels, and all his power:
he onely shall escape, <hi>sed quarto praelio debellatus, &amp;c.</hi> but he in the fourth battell with all
his host shall be subdued, and then shall suffer worthie punishment for his wickednesse: to
this purpose <hi>Lactantius lib. 7. institution. c.</hi> 17. 18.</p>
                        <p>But 1. beside that these shewe great bouldnesse in thus expounding, taking vpon them
without warrant of Scripture to expresse the verie forme of words, which shal then be vsed,
and the verie signes which shall be shewed. 2. herein further they faile, in confounding the
two ouerthrowes of Antichrist, which the Apostle doth separate: for first he saith, <hi>whom
the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth:</hi> that is, by his word: and the finall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
followeth: <hi>and abolish with the brightnesse of his comming,</hi> 2. Thessal. 2. 8. first
Antichrists hypocrisie shall be discouered by the preaching of the Gospel, which is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
fulfilled: but the remainder of his kingdome shall be reserued for the iudgement of
the great day.</p>
                        <p>3. They which vnderstand this of the Turkish Monarchie, as <hi>Melancthon,</hi> or of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist
of Rome, as <hi>Bulling. Osiand.</hi> or of the Romane state, as <hi>Calvin,</hi> are confuted by this
argument: because here the destruction of one particular man is set forth, as in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
part the prophesie runneth still vpon one principall agent, in the warres before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Iunius</hi> in his annotations, vnderstanding all this of Antiochus, doth thus interpret
these words: <hi>he shall come to the ende,</hi> that is, of his kingdome, namely to <hi>Persepolis</hi> in <hi>Ely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mais,</hi>
which was in the vtmost bounds of his dominion: But in his commentarie he better
expoundeth it of the ende of his life: so also <hi>Polan. H. Br. Porphyrius,</hi> though an enemie
to the Christian faith, yet herein agreeth with the truth, applying this whole prophesie vnto
Antiochus: but he is deceiued, in naming the place of his death to be <hi>Tabis,</hi> a towne of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia:
whereas he was carried to Babylon, and there sickned, 1. Macchab. 6. 4. and was stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of God with an incurable disease, that no man could helpe him: for he crawled full
of wormes, and his flesh fell off from him, so that no man could endure his stinke: yea he
was loathsome to himselfe, as is further declared, 2. Macchab. 9. 10. 12. This was the ende
of wicked <hi>Antiochus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But against this exposition it is thus obiected. 1. that <hi>Antiochm</hi> died not betweene the
Seas, and vpon the mountaine, as is here described, but as he came out of Persia, <hi>Lyranus.</hi>
2. Seeing these latter words of the chapter are ioyned with necessarie coherence to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
as they are not vnderstood of Antiochus, no more are these, <hi>Perer.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. It is not said here, that he died vpon the mountaines, or betweene the Seas,
but there was his princely pauilion spread: for while Antiochus went into Persia, he left halfe
of his armie, and his sonne Antiochus, with <hi>Lysias,</hi> who pitched in <hi>Emmaus</hi> at the entrance
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:18834:220"/>
or beginning of the hilles, as is shewed, 1. Macchab. 3. 34. 40. Now while <hi>Lysias</hi> with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
captaines were busie in suppressing of the Iewes, and were discomfited, as is further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
1. Macchab. 5. the newes thereof was brought to Antiochus beeing in Persia: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he fell into a great rage, purposing vtterly to destroy Ierusalem: but the Lord plagued
him, and he died in the way, 1. Macchab. 6. 2. Macchab. 9. And thus was the horne broken
without hand, as is prophesied, c. 8. 25.</p>
                        <p>2. This argument may be returned vpon <hi>Pererius:</hi> for seeing these words hang together
with the former; and it hath beene sufficiently shewed before, that the former part of this
prophesie, is vnderstood of Antiochus, so must the latter also.</p>

                        <p>Many of the auncient writers, as they liuing many yeares before the manifestation of
Antichrist in the world, were deceiued in these particulars; so also they were much out of
the way in true vnderstanding of other points belonging to this mysterie of iniquitie. 1.
<hi>Hyppolitus</hi> thought that Antichrist should be a Deuill incarnate,<note place="margin">Antichrist not a deuill incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</note> and be begotten by forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<hi>&amp; phantastica carnis substantia organi vice vtetur,</hi> and should vse a phantasticall
bodie, as his organe, &amp;c. he thinketh that he should not haue a true bodie, but onely in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Damascen</hi> thinketh not that Antichrist should be a Deuill incarnate, yet he saith,<note place="margin">Antichrist whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther actually possessed of the deuill.</note>
that <hi>illum inhabitet Diabolus, &amp;c.</hi> the deuill should dwell in him, <hi>lib. 4. de fide orthodox. c.</hi>
18. that the Deuill should possesse him both bodie and soule, that in him and by him he
should exercise and practise all his malice. But these are mens fansies: 1. S. Paul calleth
him the man of sinne: therefore a man he shall be, and not a deuill in mans likenes. 2. and
his comming shall be by the operation of Sathan, 2. Thess. 2. 9. not by the possession, and
habitation of Sathan: Sathan may worke by those whome he possesseth not, and he may
possesse their bodies by whome he worketh not.</p>
                        <p>3. An other opinion of some auncient writers is,<note place="margin">Whether Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ shall be borne in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon.</note> that Antichrist should be borne in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon:
as <hi>Gregorie</hi> would gather so much out of the 2. of Numbers, where it is saide, that
<hi>Dan</hi> pitched his tents toward the North: for <hi>Babylon Antichristi patria Aquilonaris est,

&amp;c.</hi> for Babylon the countrey of Antichrist is North to Iudea. <hi>Gregor. lib. 31. moral. c.</hi> 10.
But this is a very slender collection: 1. there onely the situation of the seuerall tribes is
described, how they were placed in respect of the Tabernacle, which marched in the middes
among them: and not onely the tribe of Dan, but of Asher also and Nepthali did campe
Northward. 2. Babylon is not now standing, but is come to perpetuall desolation, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

Ierem. 8. 16. <hi>The neying of his horses is heard from Dan:</hi> and because Apoc. 7. where 12.
thousand are reckoned of euery tribe, <hi>Dan</hi> is left out: the reason whereof they say is this,
because Antichrist should come of <hi>Dan. Pererius</hi> subscribeth to this opinion, and alloweth
of these reasons. But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> reiecteth this opinion as a fansie, and very sufficiently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth
all the former places obiected: for the first place is vnderstood of <hi>Sampson,</hi> who
was of the tribe of Dan: the second of Nebuchadnezzers comming to destroy Ierusalem,
and so <hi>Hierome</hi> also expoundeth it: and in the third place <hi>Dan</hi> is left out, and so is Ephraim;
because Ioseph is named for the latter, and Levi for Dan. Thus <hi>Bellarmin. lib. 3. de Roman.

                        <p>All these aforesaid, which affirme that Antichrist shall be a Deuill incarnate, shall be
borne in Babylon, and come of the tribe of <hi>Dan;</hi> they likewise hold, that he shall be one
particular man. And this generally is the opinion of the Romanists at this day: so <hi>Pererius,
Pintus, Bellarmine,</hi> with the rest: for if this could be prooued, the Pope should be freed from
the imputation of Antichrist.</p>
                        <p>But this opinion hath as small ground as the other, and it may thus be refelled by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
1. S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that the mysterie of iniquitie beganne euen then alreadie to worke
in his time, 2. Thess. 2. 7. and S. <hi>Iohn</hi> also agreeth, <hi>Of whome ye haue heard (namely of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ)
how that he should come, and now alreadie he is in the world.</hi> If Antichrist begunne to
shew himselfe by his Antichristian doctrine euen in the Apostles time, which is aboue
1500. yeares since, then can he not be one singular or speciall man.</p>
                        <p>2. S. <hi>Iohn</hi> againe saith, 1. Ioh. 2. 18. <hi>Babes, it is the last time, and if ye haue heard that
Antichrist shall come, euen now are there many Antichrists, whereby we know that it is the
last time:</hi> out of this place two conclusions may be inferred: the first is, Antichrist was to
come in the last times, but Antichrist is now come, therefore these are the last times: If then
Antichrist was come in his members and forerunners, he could not be one man, to haue so
many forerunners, and so long before: The other conclusion is this, that one Antichrist is
many Antichrists, which is thus prooued; those are the last daies, wherein the Antichrist
shall come: but in these last daies there are many Antichrists: therefore many Antichrists
are that one Antichrist.</p>
                        <p>3. S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith further, 2. Thess. 2. 3. <hi>There must come a departing first, and that man
of sinne must be disclosed:</hi> from hence we may reason thus: There shall be a generall depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
from the faith when Antichrist commeth: but a generall apostasie or departure from
the faith, can not be in one particular enemie: therefore there shall not be one particular e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie
to Christ, when Antichrist commeth.</p>
                        <p>But whereas the Scripture speaketh of the Antichrist in the singular number, the reason
thereof is, because the Antichrist shall be the head of that Antichristian bodie, which shall
set it selfe against the Church whereof Christ is the head: which Antichristian headship
shall not rest in the person of one particular man: but shall adhere to a personall succession
of particular men, who shall be the captaines and ring-leaders vnto all Antichristianisme.
Antichrist then vpon the foresaid reasons shall rather be an Antichristian bodie politike, as
are the Popes and Bishops of Rome, then any particular bodie. See more of this question

                           <hi>Severus Sulpitius</hi> writeth, <hi>lib. 2. sacr. histor.</hi> that it was the opinion of some, that <hi>Nero</hi>
should come againe in the ende of the world to be that great Antichrist: his words are these,
<hi>Nero creditur, etiamsi seipsum gladio transfixerit, curato vulnere eius servatus,</hi> Nero is held,
although he did thrust himselfe through with a sword, beeing healed of his wound, to be
preserued: and to that purpose they alleadge that place, Apoc. 13. 3. <hi>I saw one of his heads as

his wound healed againe.</p>
                        <p>But the same <hi>Sulpitius dialog.</hi> 2. reporteth an other opinion, that <hi>Nero</hi> should come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
in the ende of the world, and tyrannize in the West parts, compelling men to worship
the idols of the heathen: and Antichrist should rage in the East, whose seat should be at Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,

                        <p>But <hi>Augustine</hi> misliketh this opinion, and saith it is <hi>mira praesumptio,</hi> a wonderfull pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
for any so to thinke. And beside there is no probabilitie of it: for it is not like that
God would worke such a miracle for so notorious a wicked man, as either to raise him from
the dead, before the generall resurrection, or to preserue him aliue: we read onely of two
that were translated, Henoch and Elias, both holy men: for such a wicked man to be transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
it neither hath probabilitie, neither yet is there any example for it.</p>
                        <p>That place in the Revelation is indeede vnderstood of <hi>Nero,</hi> but not in that sense: in him
the stocke of the Cesars was extinguished, and so the Imperiall succession receiued a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                           <hi>Pererius</hi> concurring with other Romanists, thinketh that Antichrist shall be the greatest

the three kings, which Antichrist shall subdue, shall be three kings of Asia; whereas <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rerius,</hi>
and so likewise <hi>Bellarmine</hi> suppose them to be in Africa: so well men agree together,
when they follow their owne fansies.</p>
                        <p>2. Whereas <hi>Pererius</hi> would haue Antichrist to be the greatest Monarch that euer was
in the world, because it is said, v. 24. that <hi>he should doe that, which his fathers had not don, nor
his fathers fathers,</hi> that place is vnderstood of Antiochus, who is not simply saide to doe
that, which his fathers had not done: for there were of his predecessors, mightier then he, as
<hi>Seleucus Nicanor,</hi> and <hi>Antiochus</hi> the great: but none had made such spoile of Egypt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,

                        <p>1. It is also an old opinion, that Antichrist shall worke many strange miracles: as <hi>Hyppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litus</hi>
thus setteth them downe, <hi>Leprosos mundabit, paraclyticos sanabit, daemones expellet,
&amp;c. he shall clense the lepers, heale them that haue the palsey, cast out deuills<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he shall tell things
farre off, as if they were present, raise the dead, remooue mountaines, walke with his feete vpon
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:18834:222"/>
the sea, bring downe fire from heauen, he shall turne the day into darkenes, and night into day,
and bring the Sunne about which way he will, and he shall shew that all the elements are obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
vnto him:</hi> so also <hi>Lactantius</hi> saith, <hi>l. 7. c.</hi> 17. that he shall stay the sunne from his course,
and cause images to speake.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Pererius</hi> also deliuereth his opinion thus, speaking more distinctly of these miracles:
Some are profitable miracles, as such as Christ did in healing of the lame, and sicke: some are
curious, as to cause images to speake, and to cause ignorant persons, and children to speake
with diuers tongues: some are powerfull miracles, as to bring downe fire from heauen, and
to command the Sunne: all these things he thinketh Antichrist shall doe. But yet there are
some miracles which are done by a supernaturall power, as to raise the dead, which onely
God can doe, and these shall be exempted out of Antichrists power: yet whatsoeuer may
be wrought by naturall causes, Antichrist, the deuill concurring with him, shall doe, though
they be neuer so strange.</p>
                        <p>3. But these are mens phansies and dreames: 1. to heale diseases naturally incurable, as
to make men see or heare, that are naturally blind, is beyond any naturall cause: and onely
the Creator can heale those defects in his creature. 2. much more supernaturall is it to
command the Sunne, and to change the season of the day or night: the Deuill can doe none
of these things. 3. Neither can he by his owne power raise lightning and tempest: for the
Lord brought vpon Egypt by Moses ministerie the great thunder and lightening:
and the fire which came downe from heauen, and destroied <hi>Iobs</hi> sheepe, is called the
fire of God, wherein it pleased God to vse the ministerie of Sathan: for if this were in Satans
power, then Baals priests that serued the Deuill, might haue brought downe fire from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to consume the sacrifice, as Elias did. 4. The Deuill yet, when the naturall causes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne
to worke, can applie them, and remooue them from place to place, as the fire and
lightning beeing caused by Gods power, he might bring it downe vpon Iobs sheepe: and
the winds first raised, he directed vpon the house, where Iobs children were: though of his
owne power he can not cause lightening and tempest: see this question handled more at
large, <hi>Hexapl. in Exod. c. 7. qu.</hi> 15. 5. Whereas then it is said, that Antichrist shall bring
downe fire from heauen, and cause an image to speake, though some vnderstand these things
mystically,<note place="margin">Synops. Centur. 1. err. 63.</note> 
                           <hi>Bulling.</hi> as I haue shewed els where; yet it may literally also be vnderstood: for in
the Popes legends such things are to be found, that their canonized Saints are said to haue
raised tempests, walked vpon the sea, and caused images to speake: such things their legend
stories are full of. And at the tombs of their Saints, to the which simple people come in pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage,
they made them beleeue, that many blinde receiued their sight, many comming
lame, returned hole and sound: yea they imagined the dead to be raised out of their graues.
6. And these strange things, so farre as the power of Sathan could extend, were done verily:
for euen such things were wrought by the operation of Sathan among the heathen: as <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi>
a Vestal Virgin to prooue her chastitie, did stirre a shippe alone by tying her girdle to it:
and <hi>Tucia</hi> an other Virgin of the same order, did carrie water in a sive from the riuer Tibris
to the Capitol. <hi>Plin. lib. 28. c.</hi> 2. But many of their strange works, were but fained and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
miracles, such are those fore-named, which they fable to be done at their Saints
tombes. So that, though all the foresaid miracles, mentioned by <hi>Hyppolius (Pererius</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing)
shall be wrought by Antichrist: yet many of them, some true, some forged, haue
beene practised in the Papal Church, that in this behalfe, we neede goe no further to seeke

the great citie which then ruled ouer the earth was Babylon, Apoc. 17. 5. 18. but that
was Rome, which then had the command of the earth: <hi>Hierome</hi> also saith, speaking of

obtaine a most large Empire, shall thus say vnto him: We will all obey you, for we acknowledge

may be discerned.</head>
                        <p>1. As he is called Antichrist, so he shall in all things be opposite and contrarie vnto
Christ. 1. Christ was most holy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by the spirit of God which remained in him, was
mooued in his thoughts, words, and workes onely to that which was good: but Antichrist
by the operation and instinct of Sathan shall be stirred vp vnto all kind of euill: this <hi>Pererius</hi>
confesseth: &amp; how this hath bin performed in that Romish chaire of pestilence, all the world
seeth, and they which are not wilfully blinded must needes acknowledge: what blasphemie,
idolatrie, profanenes, vncleannes of life, murders, and other impieties haue beene committed
by that Sea, hath beene abundantly shewed elswhere: so that that title, which the holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
hath giuen vnto Antichrist, calling him <hi>the man of sinne,</hi> 2. Thess. 2. 8. doth more fitly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
vnto none, then to the Bishop of Rome. 2. Christ was humble and meeke: but Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
shall be most proud. 3. Christ was most obedient vnto his father, and gaue most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
testimonie of him: Antichrist shall be most contumelious and blasphemous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God, and therfore he is said Apoc. 13. to be full of the names of blasphemie. 4. Christ
came to preach the truth, Antichrist shall be the sower of all corrupt and false doctrine. 5.
Christ said his kingdome was not of this world: but Antichrist shall altogether seeke the
pompe and glorie of this world. 6. Christ was the head of all good and holy men, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist
shal be <hi>caput malorum,</hi> the head of the euill and wicked men. These notes and marks
<hi>Pererius</hi> giueth of Antichrist, shewing wherein he shall be an enemie and aduersarie vnto
Christ. All which notes and markes doe most fitly agree to the Bishop of Rome: for what
place can shew more examples of all kind of wickednes then that? who is more proud and
ambitious blasphemous then he? where is taught more false and corrupt doctrine then
there? who seeketh more the outward pompe of the world then he? and who els chalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
to be head of the (malignant) Church but he?</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Pererius</hi> saith that Antichrist shall be a great dissembler and hypocrite, he shall make
a shew of three great vertues, chastitie, abstinencie, and pietie. And who maketh a greater
shew of these then the Pope? he would seeme to be so chast, that he forbiddeth his Clergie
lawfull marriage, yet suffering them to practise secretly all kind of vncleannes: he would
seeme to be abstemious in forbidding the vse of lawfull meates: and for his pietie he will be
saluted and called <hi>the most holy father.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. Antichrist shall corrupt many with his great gifts and liberall rewards: And so the
Pope hath Cardinals hats, Archbishops palles, Bishops miters, and other dignities, with am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and large reuenues to bestow vpon his followers: as Bishop <hi>Fisher</hi> in king Henries daies
was rewarded with a Cardinals hat for his good seruice in maintaining the Popes suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie:
but the head that should haue worne it, was first set vp vpon London bridge. <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
for his great paines taken in defending of the Popes supremacie, and other points of
Antichristian doctrine, was made a Cardinal.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Pererius</hi> addeth further, that whome Antichrist cannot winne with flatterie &amp; gifts,
he will seeke to ouercome by terror and torments, <hi>lib. 14. in 11. Dan. v.</hi> 21. Such hath beene
the practise of the Antichristian Prelates, as the former daies of persecution in England doe
plentifully testifie: for first they would set vpon the faithfull seruants of God by flatterie and
faire promises, and so not preuailing, they would threaten faggot and fire: this may be eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
seene in the examinations of the blessed seruants of God, <hi>D. Taylor, M. Philpot. M.
Bradford,</hi> with the rest.</p>
                        <p>5. Last of all, Antichrist shall deceiue, saith <hi>Pererius, faciendo plurima &amp; admiranda pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digia,</hi>
by working many prodigious things: And this hath beene the continuall practise of
the Papal Church, with forged miracles to deceiue the simple people, as hath beene before

                        <p>4. <hi>Antiochus</hi> is also described by his dissimulation,<note place="margin">4. his dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> that he with the king of Egypt shall

                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. It shall be shewed that apostasie is here to be taken, not as the word is vsed
in the Ciuill lawe, for a departure either of a subiect from the obedience of his prince, or of
a souldier from his captaine: for S. Paul speaketh not here of such ciuill and politike matters:
or as the Romanists call apostasie, when one leaueth the order and sect into the which he
was entred: for in S. Pauls time, there were no such superstitious sects of Monkerie: but
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:18834:224"/>
that Apostasie here is to be taken for a departure and falling away from the faith, it may thus
appeare.</p>
                        <p>1. So is this word vsed in other places of the newe Testament: as Act. 21. 11. <hi>They are

also vpon this place mislike not this sense.</p>
                        <p>2. A disposition or preparation it cannot be vnto Antichrists kingdome: because it is
said that the man of sinne shall thereby be disclosed: he shall then come together with it,
because he shall be reuealed by it.</p>
                        <p>3. But it is a false imputation vpon the Protestants, that they are Apostataes: They haue
separated themselues from the Church of Rome, as did Enosh, and the faithfull of the olde
world from the posteritie of Caine, and as our Blessed Sauiour and his Apostles diuided
themselues from the synagogue of the Scribes and Pharisies: But they were departed first

                        <p>9. As in this great persecution vnder Antiochus there were many faithfull, that did not
forsake the lawe, but did cleaue vnto the Lord, and instructed others so to doe likewise,
who were most cruelly persecuted for their faith: so in the times of persecution vnder the
Romane Antichrist, many of all sorts, that haue opposed themselues to his vngodly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
haue beene euill entreated, and cruelly handled. 1. both Emperours. 2. Kings.
3. Princes. 4. Learned confessors of the truth. 5. whole Churches, as now shall be brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shewed in order.</p>
                        <p>1. Of the Emperours. First, <hi>Philippicus Bardanius,</hi> because he commanded all images
to be remooued out of Churches by the consent of Iohn Patriarke of Constantinople,<note place="margin">Emperors per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted by the Pope.</note> was
declared to be an heretike together with the said Patriarke, and publikely excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in a certaine Synod by Pope <hi>Constantine,</hi> who inhibited that the image of the said Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
should be stamped in any siluer or gold, or any mention to be made of him in the
common prayers, <hi>Vrspergens.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Leo</hi> the 3. <hi>Isauricus,</hi> called <hi>Iconomachus,</hi> a fighter against images, caused images in Italie
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:18834:225"/>
and Sicilie to be cast out of the Churches, and by his publike edict commaunded all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
to be remooued: for the which fact he was excommunicated of <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 2. and <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie</hi>
the 3. and the <hi>Venetians</hi> with others were stirred vp to rebellion, and the <hi>Eparch</hi> or
viceroy with his sonne slaine: by which occasion the Pope stripped the Emperour of his <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archateship</hi>
or gouernement of Italie, which the Emperours of Constantinople had held an
164. yeares.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Constantine</hi> the 5. in a synode at Constantinople of 330. Bishops, decreed that images
should be cast downe and burned, and no more be worshipped, nor the Virgin Marie pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vnto: that Saints reliques should not be kept: that it should be lawfull for Monkes and
Nunnes to marry: for the which Stephanus the 2. translated the Empire of Constantinople
into Fraunce: and his bodie was taken vp 23. yeares after it was buried, by the Empresse <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene</hi>
(to please Pope <hi>Adrian</hi>) and burnt to ashes.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Constantine</hi> the 6. for remoouing images which his mother <hi>Irene</hi> had set vp, was by her
depriued of his kingdome, sight, and life also.</p>
                        <p>No better dealt the Popes with their owne Emperours of the West. <hi>Henrie</hi> the 4. who
had encountred with his enemies 62. times in open battell, was by <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 7. <hi>Vrbane</hi>
the 2. <hi>Paschal</hi> the 2. excommunicate: his Empire was first giuen to Rodolphus the Duke
of <hi>Suevia:</hi> then his sonnes were set against him, vnder colour of religon: first <hi>Conrodus,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
<hi>Henricus</hi> the 5. his sonne, who depriued him of his Empire, and caused his bodie to
be digged vp, after it was buried, and cast forth as a carion into the fields, where it lay vnbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
fiue yeares, vntill it was brought to Spire, and there buried. <hi>Friderike</hi> the 1. called <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barossa,</hi>
was most hardly vsed by the Popes <hi>Adrian</hi> the 4. and <hi>Alexander</hi> the 3.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Philip</hi> the sonne of the said <hi>Friderike</hi> by the procurement of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the 3. who
established transubstantiation, was slaine at <hi>Bamberge</hi> by <hi>Otto Count Palatine.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Otto</hi> the 4. and <hi>Friderike</hi> the 2. were excommunicate by Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the 3. and
<hi>Gregor.</hi> 9.</p>
                        <p>Henrie the 7. was poisoned with a consecrate host by a Monke of the faction of the
<hi>Guelphes,</hi> which was on the Popes side: the <hi>Gibellines</hi> were an other faction, which held with
Emperour.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Lodovike</hi> the 4. was likewise excommunicate by the Pope, who sent forth his Monkes
and Friers into euerie quarter to defame the Emperour, and the Cardinals did stirre vp the
Princes to warre against him, <hi>Avent.</hi> And thus haue the Popes handled the Emperours:
Kings, and Princes, opposing themselues to their superstition, haue found no better measure.</p>

                           <hi>Lodovike</hi> the 12. was much encumbred by <hi>Iulius</hi> the second: who himselfe leading his
armie from Rome, as he went ouer the bridge of the riuer Tiber, threw S. Peters keies
into the riuer; and seeing they would doe him no good, he said he would betake himselfe

                           <hi>Henrie</hi> the 4. now king of Fraunce, was assaulted by 6. Popes, <hi>Gregor.</hi> the 13. <hi>Sixtus</hi> the

to be God, nor man, <hi>sed medius inter vtrunque,</hi> but a middle thing betweene both: <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin.

he take vpon him to worke wonders against the truth: which are called lying wonders in

                        <p>1. Some doe vnderstand it of the Temple of Ierusalem, which they say, Antichrist shall
cause to be builded againe, and therein he shall sit to be worshipped as God: so <hi>Hyppolitus,
Cyrillus:</hi> and <hi>Chrysostome</hi> misliketh not this sense in his Commentarie vpon the 2. of the 2.
epistle to the <hi>Thessal.</hi> But this can not be the meaning: 1. because the Temple of Ierusalem
shall neuer be builded againe, according to the saying of our Sauiour, that one stone should
not be left vpon an other. The Iewes were licensed by <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostata to reedifie their
Temple, but they could not goe forward: that which they built in the day, was cast downe
in the night, and beside a strange fire came forth, which consumed the instruments and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines
of the artificers. 2. And though that Temple should be builded againe, it could not
be called the Temple of God, seeing it should be set vp to revive the sacrifices and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of Moses law, which are abolished by Christ.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Theodoret</hi> and <hi>Damascen</hi> vnderstand it of the Temples of Christians which Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
shall command to be set vp and erected to his worship: but thus he should sit in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
temples, whereas the Apostle speaketh of Temple, in the singular: neither doth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
call the Churches of Christians by the name of <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>3. Wherefore the Apostle meaneth hereby, not materiall temples, but by the Temple he
vnderstandeth the Church of God, as it is called, 1. Cor. 3. 16. Apoc. 3. 12. Not that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
shall in deede sit in the true Church of God, for he shall be an enemie to the Church
of Christ: but he shall sit in the visible Church so reputed: and he shall style and title him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
by the Church: As he taketh vpon him to be Head of the Church, and to be Christs
Vicar in earth: <hi>Melancth. Papp. Fulke annotat. 2. Thess. 2. v.</hi> 4. He sitteth also in the temple
of mens consciences, taking vpon him to haue power to forgiue sinnes, and to make lawes to
binde the conscience. <hi>Bulling.</hi>

where sometime was the Church of God: but the Apostle speaketh of the Temple, that
shall then be so reputed and taken, at the time of Antichrists sitting therein.</p>

so the Romane Antichrist hath both so taught, that he is to doe what he list, and he
hath practised, and prospered accordingly. For the first: <hi>Nicolaus</hi> the Pope thus writeth to
<hi>Michael</hi> the Emperor, <hi>à seculari potestate nec ligari posse, nec solvi Pontificum, &amp;c.</hi> that the
chiefe Bishop can neither be loosed, nor bound of the secular power: and then he inferreth
how that <hi>Constantine</hi> the Emperor called the Pope God: and so concludeth, <hi>nec posse Deum
ab homme iudicari manifestum est,</hi> it is manifest, that God is not to be iudged of man, &amp;c.
And these are their positions in their Canons, <hi>that the Pope is without law,</hi> and that he is to
be iudged of none: and if all the world should determine any thing against the Pope, yet
the sentence rather of the Pope must stand: and seeing he hath all fulnesse of power, no man
is to say vnto him, <hi>why doe you so?</hi> for his will standeth for reason, <hi>distinct. 19. 17. quaest. 4.

                        </p>
                        <p>And as this is their doctrine, that the Pope may doe what he list, and no man is to checke
or controll him: so he hath mightily prospered in his wicked proceedings, as <hi>Antiochus</hi>
did: for Emperors, Kings, and Princes haue furthered his enterprises: learned men haue and
doe desend his errors: All kingdomes almost in the Christian world, Vniuersities, schollers,
haue applauded him: So many Monasteries in diuers countries with their Monks and Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
depended of him. This is the prosperitie and externall happie successe, which the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists
doe boast of; and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> among the rest, maketh it a speciall note to know the true
Church by: but as <hi>Antiochus</hi> prosperous successe against Christs Church was no signe of
Gods fauour toward him, no more is it in the kingdome of Antichrist. But I will here stay a

                        <p>1. In the time of <hi>Innocentius</hi> the 3. the Catholikes in France with an armie of 8000.

                        <p>2. <hi>Anno</hi> 1531. the <hi>Helvetian</hi> Papists, had fiue conflicts with the <hi>Helvetian</hi> Protestants,
and still had the better.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Charles</hi> the 5. <hi>ann.</hi> 1547. obtained a miraculous victorie against the Protestant Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in Germanie.</p>
                        <p>4. In <hi>France</hi> and the low countries, the Papists haue had many victories, not without
miracle: and the Protestants seldome had the better.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi>Ans.</hi> These instances produced by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> are false, as shall now appeare in the
particular examination of them. 1. <hi>Mathias Parisiens.</hi> reporteth farre otherwise of that
battell, writing, that <hi>Lewes</hi> the French king died in the siege of <hi>Avenion,</hi> and that his sonne
hauing the leading of a great armie against the <hi>Albigenses</hi> was ouercome <hi>ab exiguis copijs,</hi>
of a few small bands. And this is like to be the truer report: for it seemeth not probable, that
the persecuted Church of the <hi>Albigenses</hi> could set forth such an huge armie. 2. The Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
<hi>Helvetians</hi> had not so many battells with the Protestants: there was but one battell and
a skirmish: the Popish sort had the better, hauing the aduantage of the higher ground: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was it such a great victorie, for they were glad to aske peace, and to compound the
matter vpon equall conditions. 3. It was no miracle for <hi>Charles</hi> the 5. to preuaile in that
battell, setting vpon Duke <hi>Fredericke</hi> on a sudden, and some of his confederates hauing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
him: neither did the Emperor long enioy that victorie, for he was not long after by
<hi>Mauritius,</hi> who ayded him against Duke <hi>Frederike,</hi> chased out of Germanie for the wrongs
offered vnto Philip the Lantgraue, and neuer after that returned he into Germanie againe.
4. Of the successe of the battells in France and low Germanie, they haue no cause to brag:
<hi>Henrie</hi> the 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was alwaies superiour in battell: and how the warres haue prospered on the Protestants
sides in the low countries, no man is ignorant. So that if the goodnes of the cause is to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed
by the good successe, if they had no other arguments to defend themselues, this
might plead for them, that God hath aboue these 30. yeares vpheld that small countrey mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculously
against all the power of Spaine. But they haue diuers reasons besides, which may
iustifie their warres against the king of Spaine.</p>
                        <p>1. The breaking of their priuiledges by the Duke of <hi>Albanie:</hi> 2. the vnreasonable exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
of tribute vpon things which were sold:<note place="margin">The reasons which mooued the low coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries to defend themselues by warre against the king of Spaine.</note> 3. the vniust execution of diuers both noble
and others: 4. the setting of garrisons of strangers in their cities: 5. the building of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
and sconces: 6. the constituting of Iudges of the Spanyards, and not of their owne
countrey: 7. the generall restraining of their libertie, <hi>Polan. p.</hi> 1070. 8. beside the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in among them of a strange religion.</p>
                        <p>2. Now that outward prosperitie is not a signe of Gods fauour, or a marke whereby to
discerne the Church, it is euident by the example of <hi>Antiochus</hi> here, who mightily prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in his wicked attempts against the people of God: So also Nebuchadnezzer preuailed
against Ierusalem, and destroied the very Temple. All the tribes of Israel beeing assembled
together, against the children of Beniamin, hauing the better cause, yet were twice ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
Iudg. 20. God then in suffering his Church to be for a time afflicted and oppressed,
doth not thereby testifie his fauour toward their oppressors, but doth rather shew his wrath
against his owne people for their sinnes: which was the cause that Antiochus prospered,
whome the Lord vsed as his scourge: as it is here saide, <hi>till wrath be accomplished:</hi> that is,
Gods wrath kindled against his people. And the same is one of the reasons, why the Lord

                        <head>19. Contr. Why the Lord suffereth Antichrist to rage against his Church.</head>
                        <p>That is no reason which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> pretendeth, that the Romane Church is by their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
prosperitie knowne to be the true Church, and therefore it is giuen vnto them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper:
but these rather are the causes:</p>
                        <p>1. That herein Gods mercie may appeare, who for a long time tied vp and bound Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>han,
though for a while he be let loose: yet in that vntill the reuealing of Antichrist, he was
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:18834:227"/>
bridled, and not suffered hetherto to powre out all his malice against the Church of God, it
must be ascribed to his mercie.</p>
                        <p>2. The Lord by this persecution vnder Antichrist will trie out the faithfulnes of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,
that they may be discerned from the hypocrites: as it is shewed here in the former
verse, that diuers were suffered to fall into affliction, to trie and purge them: both that they
might be scuered and purged from hypocrites, as the wheat is from the chaffe and drosse;
and that the Lord also might haue experience of the faithfulnes and constancie of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants.
Hereupon <hi>Hyppolitus</hi> thinketh, that the Martyrs vnder the tyrannie of Antichrist,
shall be the most glorious Martyrs, that euer were in any persecution before: which verily
may be affirmed of our holy Martyrs that suffered in the daies of Queene Marie in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
and then and since in other places: for beside that their torments and cruell manner of
death were equivalent,<note place="margin">
                              <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                              </gap>
                           </note> the cause for the which they suffered was more hard to be iudged of,
and their enemies more subtle: for the Martyrs of the Primitiue Church died for not yeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
vnto most grosse idolatrie of the heathen, which was most manifest impietie: and their
aduersaries were professed enemies to all Christianitie: But these latter Martyrs suffered for
matters of religion, euen controuerted among Christians, and their persecutors themselues
pretending to be Christians.</p>
                        <p>3. A third reason is, that God by the hypocrisie and tyrannie of Antichrist, punisheth the
sinnes of the world, which abounded at the reuealing of Antichrist. <hi>Hyppolitus</hi> thus well
setteth forth the iniquitie of those times, wherein Antichrist shall come: <hi>omnes suo arbitratu
vivent, silij manus inijcient in parentes, &amp;c.</hi> all shall liue as they list, the sonnes shall lay vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
hands vpon their parents: the wife shall deliuer the husband to death, the husband the
wife: masters shall be cruell toward their seruants, and seruants shall be stubborne against
their masters: no man shall reuerence the aged, nor haue pitie on the poore: then shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanters
and sorcerie be in force: Pastours shall become wolues, and Monks shall couet and
desire the things of the world, &amp;c. All these vices and corruptions abounded in the world,
when Antichrist beganne to shew himselfe, and these things are yet practised vnder the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
tyrannie: Wiues doe accuse their husbands, and husbands their wiues, children the
parents, and parents the children, one brother riseth against an other to put them to death
for religion. So that for these and other sinnes, the hard yoke of Antichristian bondage yet
lieth vpon the world. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth the reason thereof, 2. Thess. 2. 11, 12. <hi>God shall
send them strong delusions to beleeue lies, that all they might be damned which beleeue not the
truth, but had pleasure in vnrighteousnes.</hi> And so those nations, which are yet in bondage
vnder Antichrist, because they desire not to leaue their superstition, and vnrighteous liuing,
but still continue enemies to the truth, therefore they are by the iust iudgement of God kept
still in ignorance and misbeleefe.</p>

                           <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. Antichrist here described, shall doe what he list, and exalt himselfe against
God, as not holding himselfe tied vnto any law, nor acknowledging any superiour: so doth
not the Pope, who taketh himselfe to be bound vnto the law, and confesseth Christ to be his
Iudge and superiour.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ans.</hi> The Pope confesseth thus much in words, but in effect he abrogateth the law of
God, and so consequently denieth Christ to be his superiour.</p>
                        <p>1. The Pope dispenseth against the law of God, which sheweth his superioritie ouer the
law: Pope <hi>Martin</hi> the 5. with the aduise of his Popish diuines, dispensed with one to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
his owne sister germane: this is committed to writing by <hi>Antoninus Florentin. summ. 3.

26. such were the incestuous mariages of Egypt: for <hi>Ptolome Philadelphus</hi> maried his
owne sister <hi>Berenice,</hi> and so did Ptolome Philopator his sister <hi>Eurydice,</hi> whome he killed:
Ptolome <hi>Physcon</hi> married <hi>Cleopatra</hi> his brother Philometors wife: in which very case the
Pope dispensed with <hi>Henrie</hi> the 8. to marrie his brother Prince Arthurs wife.</p>
                        <p>Likewise the law of God forbiddeth the setting vp of all images to be worshipped, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit.
18. 9. which the Pope commandeth euery where to be done. The holy Apostle saith,
that concupiscence is against the law, and consequently sinne, Rom. 7. 7. But the Pope in his
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:18834:228"/>
Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> decreed the contrarie, that concupiscence is not <hi>vere &amp; proprie pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>
verily and properly sinne.</p>
                        <p>2. As the Pope alloweth that which Gods law forbiddeth and condemneth, so likewise
he forbiddeth that, which Gods word alloweth and commandeth. As Gods word comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
obedience to parents, but the Pope set <hi>Conradus</hi> and <hi>Henrie</hi> against their father Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
the 4. who warred against him; and Henrie depriued him of his Empire, and of Christian
sepulture. Our Sauiour biddeth to giue vnto Cesar, the things which are Cesars; as homage,
tribute, obedience: but <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 2. forbad tribute to be paied to <hi>Leo</hi> the 3. for pulling
downe of images, or any obedience to be yeilded vnto him. The Scripture alloweth, that
they which haue not the gift of continencie, should marrie: but <hi>Calisthus</hi> the 3. refused to
dispense with the marriage of a certaine Deacon, that alledged he had not the gift of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie,
for whome also <hi>Cardinal Senensis</hi> entreated, who was afterward Pope called <hi>Pius</hi>
the 2. who writ hereof vnto his friend in these words, <hi>alterum Papam expectandum, qui

20. The Scripture counteth mariage honourable, and maketh it free for all men, Hebt. 13. 4.
yet the Pope forbiddeth mariage to his Clergie, as a disgrace to their orders.</p>
                        <p>3. And that it yet may more euidently appeare, how the Pope extolleth himselfe aboue

the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost: yea all the Saints in heauen, images and reliques
in earth (if we will beleeue the Protestants, saith <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) he adoreth also.</p>

                           <hi>Answ.</hi> In that the Pope inuocateth Saints, praieth vnto images, adoreth reliques, and

prospered, by his carnall preaching seducing many, who of a silly Monke became as it were

was so called and counted many yeares since. 2. the prospering here spoken of is not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of any spirituall successe by the preaching of the Gospell, but of such prosperous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents
as are compassed by violence and force of armes, and cunning deuises. 3. it is no car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

                        <p>But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to cleare his great Master the Pope of this suspition also, he alleadgeth,
that in the originall the words stand thus; <hi>and he shall be in the desires of women:</hi> though
that in the Greeke translation it be read negatiuely, <hi>he shall not, &amp;c.</hi> And he giueth two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectures
why it should be read rather affirmatiuely, then negatiuely; both because <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi>
as <hi>Hierome</hi> writeth, who is here historically meant, was giuen vnto the desire and lust
of women: neither is it probable, that Antichrist should command or commend single life:
but the Iewes rather doe expect, that Antichrist shall suffer them to haue many wiues, which
they count a part of their terrene happines.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. That it is more agreeable to the originall to read here negatiuely, <hi>he shall not
haue respect to the desires of women,</hi> then affirmatiuely, is shewed before, qu. 45. whether I
referre the Reader. 2. Though <hi>Antiochus</hi> were one way giuen vnto the desire of women,
in respect of his carnall lust, yet an other way he was not, in not regarding the request and
desire of his wife, for to spare Ierusalem, as is shewed likewise before, qu. 45. 3. It is most
probable, nay rather that Antichrist shall enioyne single life, and restraine marriage, because
he shall maintaine the doctrine of deuills, whereof this is one. 4. And though the Iewes
expect such carnall libertie, when their Messiah commeth, that is nothing to the purpose:
for such a Messiah, as they expect, shall neuer come. But we know certenly that the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
should come into the world, and is indeede alreadie come. 5. And that Antichrist
shall outwardly seeme to maintaine single life, it is the opinion of their owne writers, <hi>exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius

a newe kind of images into the Church: as one of them obtained of Phocas the Emperour,
the Church of Gentile idols called <hi>Paentheon</hi> in Rome, and set vp the images of Saints in
stead thereof: likewise they doe make the virgin Marie their Ladie and goddesse, making
her their Mediatrix, and offring vp prayers, consecrating Churches vnto her: And thus they
haue framed vnto themselues a newe goddesse whom their fathers knewe not.</p>
                        <p>But the most famous idol of all is their newe deuise of transubstantiation, and of their
breaden god, and their idolatrous sacrifice of the Masse: wherein they commit many profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.
1. They giue vnto euerie Priest power to make the bodie of Christ, and therein
thinke them more worthie then the Virgin Marie: for she was conceiued but once with the
holy flesh of Christ, but they doe make it daily. 2. they detract from the vertue &amp; efficacie of
Christs alsufficient sacrifice vpon the crosse, in adding as a supplement thereof their daily vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloodie
sacrifice (as they call it) of the Masse. 3. they ascribe vnto the Masse such vertue,
as that thereby they thinke the soules to be deliuered out of purgatorie. 4. they hold that
the Masse is auaileable <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> by the verie externall worke, without the good
intention, faith, or preparation in them, to whom it is applye. 5. They carrie their impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
god about in procession, requiring adoration with knocking, kneeling, lifting vp the
hands to be yeelded vnto it. 6. And they make their Masse a generall remedie not onely
against all spirituall but temporall euills and calamities, and a meane to obtaine both spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
and temporall blessings: as health of bodie, good successe in any businesse, victorie
in warre, good speed in mariage matters, in battell, in nauigation, and such like: whence they
haue deuised so many kinds of votiue Masses, as they are called: as for peace, for raine, for

and gold, and precious things: and as <hi>Marcellus</hi> among the Romanes robbed all other Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
to set forth and beautifie the idol-Temples at Rome: So the Romane Antichrist with
all externall pompe, outward glorie, and glittering shewe of siluer and gold, doth adorne
and beautifie this his new coined seruice. And how all their religion consisteth in nothing
els but in an outward shew, and vaine-glorious pompe, it is euident in these three things, in
their persons, Churches, and solemnities.</p>
                        <p>First for their persons, they count them good Catholikes, that obserue their outward
rites and ceremonies, though they haue no good motion and instinct at all: as if they be in
their baptisme exorcised, anealed, afterward confirmed with chrisme, and keepe fasting
daies, be sprinkled with holy water and ashes, creepe to the crosse, be confessed at Easter,
kisse the pax, goe in pilgrimage, offer to their idols, and when they die, be anealed, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to the graue with tapers and dirges, they thinke they haue performed all offices of
Christianitie.</p>
                        <p>Concerning their Churches, there is no preaching, or very seldome, and that to small e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difying,
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:18834:230"/>
no singing of Psalmes, or praying with vnderstanding: but all things are set forth
to the eare, in singing and sound of instruments, and to the eye, in adorning their images
with siluer and gold, and such like.</p>
                        <p>And touching their solemnities; all their seruice is nothing else but a meere stage-play,
from one ende of the yeare to the other.</p>
                        <p>At the natiuitie of Christ, an infant made of wood wrapped vp in swathing cloutes is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
vp and downe by boyes and girles.</p>
                        <p>In the festiuall of the three kings, which they say came to worship Christ, three apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
like kings doe goe from doore to doore singing and begging with a star made of paper.</p>
                        <p>In the day of the purification candles are carried about: and ashes are sprinkled on ash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wednesday.
In lent certaine persons disguised goe vp and downe the streets whipping them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues:
the images in the Churches are cloathed in blacke as though they mourned, the altars
are couered.</p>
                        <p>On Palme Sunday, an asse is led about, and palmes carried before: on the day of resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
after midnight the Priest taketh the image of the crucifix out of the sepulchre, and
goeth about knocking at the Church doores, and crying, <hi>be yee lift vp ye euerlasting doores,
and the king of glorie shall come in:</hi> and then the question is asked, <hi>who is the king of glorie?</hi>
and the Priest maketh answer, <hi>the Lord strong and mightie in battell, he is the king of glorie:</hi>
and so they blaspemously ascribe that vnto an image, which is due onely vnto Christ.</p>
                        <p>Before the ascension day they haue solemne processions, and then all the images of the
Saints are brought forth, and carried in shew: on the ascension day one is drawen vp in a
wooden tutret to the toppe of the Church, and as if he represented Christ, he crieth out, <hi>I
ascend vnto my father and your father:</hi> and when he is at the toppe he throweth downe
certaine consecrated hosts, and while they are gathering them vp belowe, water is powred
downe, whereupon there is raised a great laughter in the Church.</p>
                        <p>On the day of Pentecost the image of a doue is let downe from the top of the Church,
together with fire, and a noise like thunder, with this voice, Receiue ye the holy Ghost.</p>
                        <p>On <hi>corpus Christi</hi> day, the host is carried about in solemne procession, with instruments
of musicke, and loue songs, such as minstrels vse to sing at feasts, to make ghests mertie:

                        <p>But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> laboureth likewise to free the Pope of these imputations, that this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie
of the newe God <hi>Mauzzim,</hi> cannot in any sense agree vnto him.</p>
                        <p>1. First he reasoneth thus: this <hi>Mauzzim</hi> is either Antichrist himselfe, or the deuill,
whom he worshippeth: he shall command himselfe to be worshipped, and be a great sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and Magician: but the Pope is none of these.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answer.</hi> 1. We will yeeld vnto him the proposition: though indeed this place hath no
such sense, either to vnderstand Antichrist himselfe, or the deuill by the God <hi>Mauzzim,</hi> as
is shewed before, quest. 46. 2. But both the parts of the assumption are true of the Pope:
for he commandeth himselfe to be worshipped: as appeareth. <hi>lib. 1. ceremon. Pontifical.
sect. 3. c. 3. quod omnes mortales, &amp;c.</hi> that all men of what dignitie soeuer, as soone as
they come into the Popes sight, shall thrice bend their knees, and then come and kisse his
feete.</p>
                        <p>And that diuerse of the Popes haue beene great Magicians, is extant in histories: <hi>Sylve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
the 2. gaue himselfe to the deuill to obtaine the Papacie, <hi>Platin. fascicul. tempor. Benno</hi>
writeth of <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 7. that he sent two young men to fetch a booke of Necromancie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which he had forgotten, charging them not to looke vpon it: but they thereupon were the
more desirous to prie into it, and while they read in it, the deuils ministers came about them
to knowe what they should doe: who beeing amazed at the first, bid them presently to cast
downe a great wall which was neere vnto Rome, which was done forth with. <hi>Luithprandus</hi>
writeth of Iohn the 22. that he was wont, <hi>Diabolum in alea invocare,</hi> to call vpon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
as he plaied at dice: And diuerse of the Popes beside haue beene noted, to vse familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
and conference with spirits: So that taking Bellarmines owne sense we shall finde the
Popish Antichrist to worship this God <hi>Manzzim.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath here an other euasion, that <hi>Mauzzim</hi> is like to be the name of the
place where Antichrist shall lay vp his treasure, and shall there secretly worship the deuill.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Thus <hi>Bellarmine</hi> shifteth vp and downe, not knowing what to make of this
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:18834:230"/>
                           <hi>Mauzzim:</hi> one while he thinketh it to be Antichrist himselfe, then againe he will haue it to
be the deuill, and now a name of a place. 2. But we admit it that <hi>Mauzzim</hi> is the name of
a place, for it signifieth a munition or garrison: And may not such a place be found out in
Rome, where the Popes treasure lyeth, namely the castle of S. Angel?</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> addeth yet further, that Antichrist shall worship this god in secret, for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
he shall worshp no god at all, because the text saith, <hi>he shall not care for any God:</hi> but
this cannot be said of the Pope, who professeth publikly the seruice of God.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. These two may well agree together, not to care indeede for any god; and yet
to pretend outwardly a kind of publike worship in hypocrisie: as Antiochus set vp the idol
of <hi>Iupiter Olympius</hi> at Ierusalem, beeing himselfe without all sense of religion. 2. So the
Romane Antichrist, doth professe himselfe a Christian, yet is indeede an enemie to true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianitie:
And though he pretendeth to be but Christs Vicar, yet he doth magnifie himselfe,
against Christ and his gospel, as hath beene shewed before.</p>

                        <p>The things which are giuen are three, honours, places of authoritie and command, lands

it is in our power to giue it to whom we will: wherefore we are set by God ouer nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

Bishops, he is not said so much to conferre them, as they who in their godly zeale gaue such
large reuennues to the Church. Thus <hi>Bellar. lib. 3. de Rom. Pontif. c.</hi> 21.</p>

                           <hi>Contra. 1. Bellarmine</hi> discrediteth the Pope, and noteth him with the infamous marke
of ingratitude, in that he suffreth such patrons and defenders of his papall sepremacie to
goe vnrewarded: and yet there was none of these whom he nameth, but enioyed much more
then many worthie ministers of the gospell. 2. can he for shame obiect furie vnto the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,
seeing it is notorious, that diuerse of these his learned men, became furious and
madde indeede. <hi>Eckius</hi> when he died cried out, <hi>why doe not ye giue me my gold, where is my
gold?</hi> it seemeth he should haue bought some dignitie which he missed of. <hi>Latomus,</hi> when
he should haue made an oration at <hi>Bruxels</hi> against <hi>Luther,</hi> before <hi>Charles</hi> the 5. and could
not goe forward, beeing sent out with hisses, was so ashamed, that he fell madde; and vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
diuerse blasphemies in the Schooles, and in the Readers chaire, whence he was taken by
<hi>Ruardus Tapperus,</hi> and was carried to his bed, and died in despaire, saying he was damned.
<hi>Frier Cherubin,</hi> which in the yeare 1598. challenged the ministers of <hi>Berne</hi> and <hi>Geneve</hi> to
dispute with them, after he had both in words and deeds bewrayed his madnesse, was tied
with chaines, and had keepers appointed him. 3. neither is it true that they striue for Gods
glorie, but for the Popes, whom indeede they make their terrene god; and therefore they
cannot expect any reward from God: he must reward them whose seruants they are. 4. And
these great reuennues, which the Pope hath to bestowe, he hath rather gotten by rapine and
violence, then by the pietie and deuotion of others: As the Dukedome of <hi>Ferrara ann.</hi>
1598. was by Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the 8. by force and violence taken from the right heire thereof.

                        <p>1. As Antiochus vpon euery occasion was readie to inuade <hi>Aegypt</hi> and other countreys:

with pretenses and fogeries: as by that forged donation of <hi>Constantine,</hi> he challengeth to be
Lord of the Occidentall Empire: there is no king in all these West parts, whom either the
Pope hath not made in times past his vassall, or at least will not say, that he holdeth his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of him, and therefore ought to doe him homage: <hi>Boniface</hi> the 8. decreed, that it was
of necessitie of saluation, for euerie creature to be subiect to the Pope, <hi>Extrav. de maiorit.

world, <hi>lib. 1. ceremon. pontifical. c.</hi> 7.</p>
                        <p>2. As <hi>Antiochus</hi> tooke euerie opportunitie to afflict the people of God,<note place="margin">21. note: cruelty toward the Church of Christ.</note> but he spared
the <hi>Edomites, Ammonites, Moabites</hi> that assisted him, and hated the people of God as he
did, v. 41. So Antichrist ceaseth not to persecute the Church of Christ, and by all meanes
to oppresse it, and to trample vpon it: But such as are addicted to his superstitions, and are
affected toward him, he spareth, and fauoureth.</p>
                        <p>3. As <hi>Antiochus</hi> hunted after nothing else,<note place="margin">22. note: the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnesse of Antichrist.</note> but the spoile of Egypt, the treasurers of
gold and siluer, and other precious things: So the Romane Antichrist gapeth after the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure

sinnes and pardons for money, releaseth the paines of purgatorie for money, dispenseth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
with any thing for money: he imposeth taxes, tenths, mulcts of money by way of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
As <hi>Henrie</hi> the second had a mulct set vpon him for the murder of Thomas Becket,

of the harlots and vsurers. <hi>Iohn</hi> the 22. lest when he was dead 25. millions of ducats of gold

pieces by his indulgences in a very short time: the Senate of Paris in their petition to <hi>Lewes</hi>
the 11. alleadged that the Pope euery yeare had out of France 946. thousand markes. <hi>Leo</hi>

                     <p>THis Chapter, which conteineth the comforts and consolations ministred vnto Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel
is deuided into three parts. 1. the conference of the Angel with Daniel, to v. 5.
2. of one of the Angels with Christ, v. 5. to v. 8. 3. of Christ himselfe with Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,
thence to the ende of the chapter.</p>
                     <p>1. In the first part there are 4. comforts giuen vnto Daniel. 1. one is taken from the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
cause and author of their deliuerance, Michael shall stand vp for his people, v. 1. 2.
in the second place of comfort, first the time of trouble is set forth by way of comparison,
then the comfort is taken from the issue of their trouble: they which are found written in the
booke of life, shall be deliuered, v. 1. 3. the third comfort is from the hope of the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection:
they which are not temporally deliuered, shall rise vp in the ende vnto life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting.
Here the resurrection is set forth. 1. in generall, many, that is all shall awake out of
the dust. 2. in particular: there shall be two sorts, some shall rise to life, some to shame, v. 2.
3. of those which rise to life, some shall shine among the rest, as the brightnesse of the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament,
and as the starres, v. 3.</p>
                     <p>4. The fourth comfort is, that notwithstanding those troublesome times, yet the Church
of God shall continue, and many shall seeke for the vnderstanding of this booke, which to
that ende Daniel is bid to seale vp, v. 4.</p>
                     <p>2. In the second part is described. 1. the vision, that Daniel sawe, both the number, he
sawe two, and the site or place of them, v. 5. 2. their speach. 1. the question mooued, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
whom, namely, to Christ, and what, concerning the ende. 2. the answer. 1. by whom,
by him that stood vpon the waters. 2. in what manner, by an oath with the lifting vp of
both his hands. 3. what he answereth, both for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance of the time, &amp; for the end, v. 7.</p>
                     <p>3. In the third part, there is 1. Daniels question, with the occasion thereof, his not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
v. 8. 2. the answer of Christ, partly denying Daniels request, the things were
secret, and sealed vp, v. 9. partly giuing him satisfaction: 1. concerning the Church, wherein
is shewed the ende and fruit of their afflictions, set forth by the contrarie, the frowardnes of
the wicked, v. 10. and the tearme, first 1290. daies, then a 1335. v. 11. 12. 2. concerning
Daniel himselfe, that he should be content: with a double promise made vnto him, that he
should presently after his death, rest from all his labours: and afterward stand vp in his lot in
the resurrection.</p>

                        <p>1. Some referre it vnto the last time of world, after that great Antichrist shall haue raged
against the Church of Christ, which shall continue three yeares and an halfe, <hi>Lyran. Perer.

                        <p>2. <hi>Bullinger</hi> vnderstandeth it of the comming of Christ to iudgement, when there shall
be such great tribulation, as neuer was in the world before: and this may seeme as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hereof: because afterward v. 2. mention is made of the resurrection: But that is added
as a consolation: they which were not temporally deliuered in those troublesome times, yet
should be sure to rife vnto life euerlasting.</p>
                        <p>3. Some doe expound this prophesie of the persecution in the last times vnder the Turke,
<hi>Melancth.</hi> and the Romane Antichrist, <hi>as Osiand. Pappus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. <hi>M. Calvin</hi> referreth it to the time of Christs comming in the flesh.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi>M. Iunius</hi> in his commentarie interpreteth it of all the time of the gospell, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
whereof is in his first comming, and the end in his second.</p>
                        <p>6. But it is most properly referred to that time, when Antiochus left halfe his armie with
<hi>Lysias,</hi> while he went vnto <hi>Elymais</hi> in Persia: for about the same time did Iudas Maccha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beus,
by the asistance of the great Prince of the Church Michael, which is Christ Iesus, reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
Ierusalem, and purge the Temple, which had beene defiled, 2. Macchab. 10. <hi>Iun. in
his annot.</hi> the reasons why this place is thus to be vnderstood, are these: 1. because the time
here spoken of hath relation to the former storie: in that time, that is, the same time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the former things should be done: <hi>non post multa annorum millia,</hi> not after so many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
of yeares, <hi>Pellican.</hi> 2. the Angel saith, <hi>thy people,</hi> the people of the Iewes must be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
who, and not the Christians among the Gentiles, should be persecuted for religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>H. Br.</hi> 3. the euent also confirmeth this exposition: for if Michael the great Prince had
not then indeed stood vp for his Church, it had perished.</p>
                        <p>But thus it is obiected against this interpretation: 1. that <hi>Porphyrius</hi> in hatred to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
religion, to obscure the truth hath deuised this sense, <hi>Perer.</hi> 2. the rest <hi>Porphyrius</hi>
cannot make to hang together; how in Antiochus time some should awake out of the dust:
which <hi>Porphyrius</hi> vnderstandeth of those which were shut vp in caues and rockes, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
came out againe, <hi>Hierome.</hi>

                           <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Though <hi>Porphyrie</hi> were an enemie to the Christian faith, yet he might in some
particular hit vpon the truth: neither herein is the light obscured, but rather more manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted:
and though his hatred were great against the Christian religion, yet this is no impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to faith, though euerie point of faith be not prooued out of euerie place of Scripture:
the article of the comming of Christ to iudgement, is sufficiently prooued out of other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Scripture, though it be not directly concluded here. <hi>Pellican</hi> here thus writeth, I
giue thankes to <hi>Hierome, qui tam diligenter adnotauit Phorphyrij expositionem,</hi> who hath so
diligently noted Porphyrie his exposition, which he holdeth to be most reasonable. 2.
though he faile in some one point in his exposition, yet it followeth not, but that he may
come neere the truth in the rest.</p>

Thess. 4. 16. <hi>that the Lord shall descend from heauen with a shoot, and with the voice of the
Arkeangel.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Osiander</hi> thinketh that Christ is here called Michael the Arkeangel, in respect of his
office; as in the prophesie of Ezekiel he is called Dauid, yet was he not Michael the Arke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angel.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>M. Calvin</hi> leaueth it as indifferent, whether we vnderstand Christ the Mediator, or a
created Angel.</p>
                        <p>5. But that this Michael was none other but Christ, the Prince of the Angels, may be
made plaine by these reasons:</p>
                        <p>1. By the name <hi>Michael,</hi> which is compounded of these three particles, <hi>mi, cha, ell,</hi> which
signifie, <hi>which is as God,</hi> noting both the distinction of his person, and the identitie of his
nature, that he in power is equall vnto God: as the Apostle saith of Christ, Phil. 2. 6. <hi>who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the forme of God, thought it no robberie to be equall vnto God,</hi> and Heb. 1. 3. <hi>he is
said to be the brightnesse of his glorie, and the engraued forme of his person.</hi> This annotation
of the word is well vrged by <hi>Melancthon,</hi> vpon this place, <hi>Oecolampad. Iun. in comment,
Polanus, M. Br. in Daniel.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. This Michael is here called <hi>shar hagadol,</hi> the great Prince: there are principalities
and dominions so called both among Angels and men: but this Michael is called prince in
the superlatiue and highest degree, and in this respect the Apostle saith, Ephe. 1. 21. that
God hath set Christ aboue <hi>all principalities and powers, &amp;c. and euery name that is named:</hi>
And hereunto may be applyed that saying of the Apostle, that Christ <hi>is made so much the
more excellent then the Angels, as he hath obtained a more excellent name then they,</hi> namely,
to be called, <hi>a great Prince, Iun.</hi> this name or title <hi>shar hagadol,</hi> a great Prince, is translated

                           </gap>, an Arkangel, which signifieth the chiefe or Prince of Angels.
And though it be there said, 1. Thess. 4. 16. that the Lord shall descend with <hi>the voice of an
Arkangel,</hi> it followeth not that Christ is not that Arkangel, no more then it followeth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is said also in the same place, <hi>with the trumpet of god,</hi> that Christ should not be God.
<hi>Polan.</hi> And the trumpet of God, is the voice of God, as Psal. 47. 6. <hi>God is gone vp with

                        <p>3. Further this is shewed by the office of this Michael, which is to stand for the people
of God: whose protector and captaine is Christ Iesus, called therefore, Iosua 5. 15. <hi>captaine
of the Lords host:</hi> which place <hi>Iustin. Martyr dialog. cum Tryphon.</hi> vnderstandeth of Christ:
for who else is captaine of the Lords host, and protector of his Church?</p>
                        <p>4. This <hi>great Prince</hi> here mentioned, is the same, who had written vpon his thigh, <hi>the
king of Kings, and the Lord of Lords, Apocal.</hi> 17. 16. who sate vpon a white horse, his
eyes were as a flame of fire, and the wariers of heauen followed him vpon white horses:
who was called <hi>the word of God.</hi> This was no other but Christ: for to no other but vnto him,
doe all these glorious titles agree, <hi>Oecolampad.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>5. This Michael is said to haue Angels, Apocal. 12. 17. but the blessed spirits cannot

that this Michael is no other but Christ: see more hereof, c. 10. quest. 22.</p>
                        <p>But it will be obiected, that Michael is not alwayes taken for Christ, as <hi>epist. Iude</hi> 9. that

                        <head>Quest. 3. What time of trouble the Angel here
speaketh of.</head>
                        <p>v. 1. <hi>There shall be a time of trouble, such as neuer was since there beganne to be a nation
vnto that same time.</hi> 1. This time of trouble, such as neuer was any before, some referre
vnto the last persecution vnder Antichrist, whome they suppose shall be one particular man:
that whereas the Church hath beene persecuted by fiue seuerall enemies, the Iewes, the
Gentiles, by heretikes, schismatikes, and euill liuers: this last persecution shall exceede all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
for both it shall be corporall, in tormenting the bodie, and spirituall, in abrogating the
seruice of God, burning the bookes of Scripture, abolishing the vse of the sacraments. <hi>Perer.</hi>
This is true, that there shall be a most grieuous persecution vnder Antichrist: but that is not
signified here: for the accomplishment of this prophesie must not be deferred so long: and
beside, that is but a groundlesse conceit, that Antichrist shall be one particular person.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Iunius</hi> in his commentarie thinketh this time of such trouble, to be that when Christ
was borne: for the Iewes were neuer in any such slauerie, both corporally, beeing diuers
waies afflicted, oppressed, and kept vnder by the Romanes, and spiritually by the superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
traditions, and corrupt doctrines of the Scribes and Pharisies: But at that time Christ
the Messiah came in great humilitie, he did not then shew himselfe as the great Prince, in
triumphing ouer his enemies.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>M. Calvin</hi> vnderstandeth the great persecution of the Christians vnder the Romane
Empire: but the Angel still speaketh of Daniels people, that is the Iewes, how they should
be deliuered: this text then concerneth not the beleeuing Gentiles.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Osiander</hi> thus interpreteth, <hi>haec non de corporalibus afflictionibus, sed de carnificina
conscientiarum, &amp;c.</hi> these things must not be vnderstood of corporall afflictions, but of the
tormenting of the conscience vnder the Pope of Rome by his superstitious traditions,
whereby mens consciences were snared and entangled: as the doctrine of merits, Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie,
and such like: But the Angel speaketh here of such troubles, as should befall the
Iewes.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi>Bullinger</hi> doth take these for the last times, when Christ at his comming shall iudge
the world: whose iudgement shall be more terrible vnto the wicked, then was either the
destruction of the old world by water, or of Sodome by fire: the elect onely shall be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
But the Angel speaketh here of troubles which should fall vpon the elect, out of the
which they should escape: Now the terrors of the last day of iudgement shall not touch the
righteous; who shall stand forth, and appeare before Christ with boldnes.</p>
                        <p>6. These daies of trouble then, are those which came vpon the Iewes in the time of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus
Epiphanes:</hi> which are said to be the greatest troubles, that fell vpon that nation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
their other captiuities in Egypt, and in Chaldea, were but corporall; but this was both
corporall, in tormenting their bodies, and spirituall, in foreing them by torments to forsake
the law. And whereas before time some particular men were tried for their conscience, as
Daniel and the three children, Dan. c. 1. c. 3. yet there was neuer an vniuersall persecution
before for religion among the Iewes. <hi>H. Br. in Daniel.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But <hi>Lyranus</hi> obiecteth, so also <hi>Pererius</hi> and <hi>Pintus,</hi> that there were greater persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
before, then this vnder <hi>Antiochus,</hi> both <hi>intensive &amp; extensive,</hi> in the intending and
extending thereof, in the greatnes, and in the continuance: the persecution by Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzer
was both greater, for the citie and Temple was destroied, and many carried away
captiue, and many slaine: it was also longer, for it continued full 70. yeares.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> It is true, that the captiuitie of Babylon continued longer then this persecution,
but it was not greater: for beside, that all these outward calamities, of the sword, captiuitie,
spoiling of citie and Temple here concurred, they were generally persecuted for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
and religion, which triall they were neuer put vnto before: so that in this respect,
these may be said to be the greatest troubles, which euer that nation had.</p>

of, and of whome.</head>
                        <p>v. 1. <hi>At that time shall thy people be deliuered, euery one that shall be written in that booke,
&amp;c. 1. Bullinger</hi> vnderstandeth this deliuerance not in this life, but at the comming of
Christ, which time is called the day of refreshing: But then this clause should be confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with the next, v. 2. where he speaketh of those that shall rise and awake out of the dust
vnto eternall life: he therefore speaketh of an other deliuerance here.</p>
                        <p>2. Some referre it to the spirituall deliuerance of the faithfull from the persecution of
Antichrist in the end of the world, <hi>isti vere salvabuntur de tribulationibus Antichristi,</hi> these
shall truly be deliuered from the tribulation of Antichrist, <hi>Lyran.</hi> so <hi>Calvine</hi> vnderstandeth
it of the spirituall victorie and conquest, whereby the faithfull are conquerors euen in the
middes of death: <hi>Osiander</hi> of the spirituall deliuerance of the faithfull from Antichrists su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions,
by the preaching of the Gospel. But Daniel doubted not, but that all the elect
should be spiritually deliuered: therefore some other deliuerance is spoken of from those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
troubles.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Iunius</hi> in his commentarie applieth it to the vocation of the faithfull by Christ, that
although many should be called in common to the knowledge of Christ, at his comming;
yet the Elect onely should be effectually called vnto life eternall. But some externall deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
is here signified, as the Angel spake before of an outward troublesome time.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Iunius</hi> in his annotations followeth an other sense: that euery one should be tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
deliuered from those troubles, euen euery one whome it seemed good vnto God in his
immutable decree to preserue: but by the booke here is vnderstood the booke of life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they were written, which were ordained to euerlasting life, not any such knowledge or
decree of God for a particular deliuerance.</p>
                        <p>5. Some giue this sense: that all the Elect of the Iewes should by these afflictions be
brought vnto life eternall: God would sanctifie their afflictions vnto them, that thereby
they should be consecrate vnto God, and so obtaine euerlasting life according ro their ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
<hi>M. H. Br.</hi> But in this sense is excluded the temporall deliuerance, which is promised
for the comfort of the people.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi>Pellican</hi> doth expound it altogether of their temporall deliuerance, that they which
then stood for the law, <hi>obtinuerunt claram Deo auxiliante victoriam,</hi> obtained a most glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
victorie by the helpe of God: But euery one of the Elect in that time of persecution
were not deliuered: and all that temporally escaped, it is hard to say, whether they were all
elected.</p>
                        <p>7. Wherefore both these the spirituall and temporall deliuerance must be ioyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
that euery one of Gods elect should be deliuered: some both in bodie and soule: if any
of the elect were slaine and put to death in that persecution, though their bodie suffered, yet
their soule should be deliuered, and afterward in the resurrection, both soule and bodie
should be saued: as it followeth v. 2.</p>

                        <p>Because some vnderstand this deliuerance of the people of the Iewes, of their last conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and calling in the ende of the world, as <hi>Lyran. Perer.</hi> it shall not be amisse by the way
to touch somewhat of that matter.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi>Theodoret</hi> vpon this place, and <hi>Gregor. hom. 12. in Ezech.</hi> doe deliuer their opinion,
that not all the nation of the Iewes, but onely so many, as shall by the preaching of <hi>Henoch</hi>
and <hi>Elias</hi> be conuerted to the knowledge of Christ, shall be saued: the rest which shall
cleaue vnto Antichrist, who shall most of all deceiue the Iewes, they shall be damned: as it is
said, Apoc. 14. 9. <hi>If any man worship the beast, and his image, &amp;c. he shall drinke of the wine of
the wrath of God.</hi> But 1. if none els of the Iewes shall be called, saue such as shall be conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the preaching of Henoch and Elias, none are like to be called at all: for that is a meere
fable of the returne of Henoch and Elias in their owne persons, to preach vnto the world, as
is afterward shewed, Controv. 2. 2. this opinion includeth a contradiction, for if at the
comming of Antichrist, whome the Iewes suppose to be their Messiah, he shall most of all
seduce them: then is it like that very few of the Iewes shall be conuerted, but rather more
hardened, their hoped for Messiah (as they thinke) beeing come.</p>
                        <p>2. An other opinion is, that vniuersally all the Iewes shall be called, as <hi>Chrysostome</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:18834:235"/>
vpon those words, Rom. 11. 13. <hi>if the diminishing of them be the riches of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
how much more, shall their abundance or fulnesse be:</hi> which fulnesse <hi>Chrysostome</hi> thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth,
<hi>quando vniuersi ad fidem accessuri sunt,</hi> when all of them shall come vnto the
faith, <hi>hom. 19. in epist. ad Romanos.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. But the safer opinion is, betweene both these, that neither vniuersally the whole nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is like to be called: for in their best times, when as the worship of God most flourished
among them, there were many carnall men and vngodly persons among them: neither yet
shall so fewe of them be conuerted, because of the generalitie of the Apostles words v. 26.
<hi>and so all Israel shall be saued:</hi> as here in these troublesome times euerie one of the elect was
preserued: But it is euident by S. Pauls prophesie of the calling of the whole nation, that
the greater part shall be conuerted and beleeue: so that the other part of those which shall
remaine in their blindnesse and hardnesse of heart still, shall be but small in respect of the
other: And thus the Scripture vseth to take (<hi>all</hi>) for the most and greatest part. Now that
there shall be before the comming of Christ, such a generall calling of the Iewes, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
prooueth out of Isay, 59. 20. <hi>the deliuerer shall come out of Zion, and shall turne vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse

                        <p>3. <hi>Osiander</hi> by this booke meaneth the preaching of the gospell: so also <hi>Pappus</hi> of the
booke of the Scriptures: that euerie one which beleeueth them shal be saued and deliuered:
other secret booke of Gods decree, <hi>Pappus</hi> acknowledgeth none, <hi>non fingendi sunt aliqui
occulti libri, qui nomina saluandorum conteneant,</hi> we must not imagine, that there are any se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
bookes which doe containe the names of such as should be saued: But this is a verie
corrupt opinion. 1. though God neede not any materiall books, yet that he hath set downe
in his euerlasting decree the number of such as shall be saued, and that whosoeuer is not
so written in that booke, that is appointed of God vnto saluation, shall be damned, it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
out of Scripture: as S. Paul speaketh of certaine his fellowe labourers, Philip. 4. 3.
<hi>whose names are in the booke of life:</hi> and Apocal. 20. 15. <hi>Whosoeuer was not found written in
the booke of life, was cast into the lake of fire.</hi> 2. And that this is in an other booke beside the

election set downe: and the Scriptures are offred vnto all, both the elect, and not elect:
but in the booke of life onely are the elect written.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Euthymius in Psal. 68. &amp;</hi> 138. saith, that there is a threefold booke of the diuine
knowledge, <hi>vnus est vniuersalis, &amp;c.</hi> one is a generall or vniuersall booke, wherein all both
righteous and sinners are witten, which come into this world: of which booke speaketh the
Prophet Dauid, Ps. 139. 16. <hi>in thy booke were all things written:</hi> there is another booke <hi>magis

speaketh, 69. 28. <hi>Let them be put out of the booke of life, neither let them be written with the
righteous:</hi> the third booke is that, wherein the sinners onely are written, as Dan. 7. 10. <hi>the
iudgement was set, and the bookes were opened.</hi> This tripartite diuision may safely be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
sauing that the sinners are not said to be written in any booke, but not to be written: as
Apoc. 17. 8. <hi>Whose names are not written in the booke of life from the foundation of the world:</hi>
these bookes here opened, are bookes of euery ones conscience, wherein all mens workes
both good and bad are written: which bookes are diuers from the booke of life, Apoc. 20.
15. See more hereof c. 7. qu. 36.</p>
                        <p>5. This booke then here mentioned is Gods immutable decree of predestination, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they are ordained vnto euerlasting saluation, whom the lord hath freely elected in Christ:
<hi>Lyranus</hi> saith well, that this booke is <hi>conscriptio electorum in mente diuina,</hi> the writing of
the elect in the diuine minde or knowledge. God needeth not any materiall booke: but this
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:18834:236"/>
is a figuratiue phrase taken from the custome of men, who vse to write into a booke all that
are made free of a citie or corporation: as <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>non liber iste Deum commemorat,
ne obliuione fallatur,</hi> this booke serueth not to put God in minde, least he should be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
through forgetfulnesse: but this booke is, <hi>ipsa Dei praescientia, &amp;c.</hi> the prescience of
God concerning the elect, which cannot be deceiued, <hi>lib. 20. de ciuitat. Dei, c.</hi> 15. So also
<hi>Euthymius, liber Dei est summa eius scientia, scriptura perpetua memoria,</hi> the booke of God
is his high knowledge, and the writing is his perpetuall memorie, <hi>in Psal.</hi> 68.</p>
                        <p>Sometime it is called <hi>the booke</hi> of God, simply without any addition, <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the excellencie, as in this place: sometime <hi>the booke of life,</hi> Philip. 4. 3. and <hi>the booke

So three things are obserued out of these places concerning this booke. 1. that God is the

plainely to Daniel.</head>
                        <p>1. True it is, that the mysterie of the resurrection was shadowed forth, and yet darkely
in the lawe: for the translation of Henoch, was an euident proofe thereof: and our blessed
Sauiour inferreth as much, because the Lord is said in the Lawe, to be the God of <hi>Abraham,
Izaak<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> he is not the God of the dead, but of the liuing: by which necessarie col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,
Christ prooueth the resurrection of the dead against the Sadduces, Matth. 22. The
Apostle also Hebr. 12. 13. sheweth that these mysteries were knowne to the Fathers, because
they confessed themselues to be strangers and pilgrimes in the earth: <hi>for they that say such
things, declare plainely that they seeke a countrey.</hi> 2. But these deepe mysteries were but
obscurely opened in former times to the Israelites, the reasons whereof the Hebrewes yeeld
to be these two specially: 1. because in Moses time, when the lawe was giuen, there were
many which did not beleeue that God created the world and gouerned the same by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence;
and if Moses had spoken vnto them of the higher misteries, they in their weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
not being able to receiue such mysticall doctrines, would haue reiected them as fables.
2. beside then the people were fedde and allured with temporall promises, for as yet they
had hope of such things, to enioy great externall happinesse in the land of Canaan: But now
when all hope of temporall blessings is cut off, and that euen in the land of Canaan such
troublesome times are foreshewed to come vpon them, now it was verie seasonable, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
them with the hope of eternall life, <hi>H. Br. in Daniel.</hi>

                        <p>But <hi>Theodoret</hi> confuteth this interpretation by two sufficient reasons. 1. they which fled
away, and hid themselues in the caues, were all faithful men, they fledde because they would
not be forced to forsake the lawe: but these that awake out of the dust, arise some to life,
some vnto shame: so it would follow in their sense, <hi>eosdem fuisse pios &amp; impios,</hi> that the same
men were both godly and vngodly. 2. these doe rise vp to eternall life: but they which so
returned from their dennes and caues died againe. 3. wherefore though hitherto <hi>Porphyrie</hi>
hath followed the sense of this prophesie well in applying it vnto Antiochus, yet here he fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth.
4. But it is no maruell that he beeing an enemie to the Christian faith, doth obscure
by his gloases so cleare a place for the resurrection of the dead: it may seeme strange that <hi>Pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican</hi>
a Christian interpreter, should approoue that sense: This was the heresie of <hi>Philetus</hi>
and <hi>Hymeneus,</hi> which said that the resurrection was past alreadie, 2. Timath. 2. 17. as <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyrie</hi>
here affirmeth the same, vnderstanding this so euident a place for the resurrection, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorically.</p>
                        <p>2. Some thinke that mention is made here of the resurrection, because it shall followe
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:18834:236"/>
immediately after those troublesome times before spoken of: of this opinion are all they
which doe applie the times of trouble before spoken of, to the last persecution vnder Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,
as <hi>Lyranus, Perer. Pintus,</hi> with the rest of that side: likewise <hi>Melancthon statim post
haec certamina fiet resurrectio mortuorum,</hi> streight after these combates shall be the resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the dead: so also <hi>Osiander, huic postremae reformationi Ecclesiae sinis mundi imminet,</hi>
streight after this last reformation of the Church, the ende of the world shall be at hand: But
it is at large shewed before, quest. 3. that the times of trouble before spoken of, were those
which fell out vnder <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Iunius</hi> in his commentarie maketh this to be the coherence: that the Angel hauing
spoken of the first comming of Christ before, doth now ioyne thereunto his second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
declared by the effects, the resurrection of the dead: so also M. <hi>Calvin:</hi> But it hath
beene shewed before likewise, that Christs first comming in the flesh is not here intended by
the Angel.</p>
                        <p>4. This then is the reason of the connexion: that whereas before the Angel spake of the
deliuerance of the people of God, so many as were written in the booke of life: because ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Saints should be put to death, the Angel addeth an other comfort, that they should
rest in the hope of the resurrection, <hi>Polan.</hi> And that place Heb. 11. 35. may serue fitly to
expound this: <hi>some were racked, and would not be deliuered, that they might receiue a better
resurrection:</hi> this also is further shewed by the example of such as suffred then, how they
comforted themselues in the hope of the resurrection: as <hi>Razis</hi> when he pulled out his
owne bowels (which act of his cannot be commended) <hi>called vpon the Lord of life and spirit,
that he would restore them againe vnto him,</hi> 2. Macchab. 14. 46.</p>

                        <p>1. <hi>Lyranus</hi> thinketh the reason to be this, because of infants which shall rise againe; but
they cannot be said properly to awake; because they shal neither haue <hi>sensum poenae, vel glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi>

                        <p>3. Wherefore these answeares may better serue: 1. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>ponit aliquando

<hi>many:</hi> and he giueth instance of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of whom the Lord saith in one place, <hi>I haue

of Abrahams carnall generation, in the other of his spirituall seede, namely Christ, in
whom all the nations of the world should be blessed: that other instance giuen by <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi>

                        <p>The resurrection of the dead is here described<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. in generall, that <hi>many that sleepe in the

In the first part. 1. in that they are said to sleepe, the beeing and remaining of the soule
after death is signified: as the soule liueth when the bodie is layd a sleepe. 2. and by this
phrase is also noted, the naturall affection which the soule hath to the bodie, that although
they be sundred and separated a while by death, yet they both make but one man, as the
soule and bodie are vnited together in naturall sleepe: for the vnion of the soule and bodie is
essentiall, but the dissolution by death is <hi>accidentall,</hi> by reason of sinne, and therefore cannot
hinder for euer the naturall and essentiall vnion, <hi>Iun.</hi> 3. in that mention is made of the dust
of the earth, it putteth vs in minde of the first creation of man, which was out of the dust
of the earth; out of the which the Lord shall raise our bodies againe, <hi>Bulling.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, in that both good and bad are raised<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. we must consider that all are raised
both the one and the other, by the power of Christ in common: but the righteous are raised
vnto life, by the peculiar operation of Christ as he is the head of the faithfull. 2. the wicked
also shall be awaked vp vnto a kind of life, for they shall neuer die, but liue in continuall tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
but eternall life is to be considered two wayes, simply and essentially in respect of the
creature it selfe, as it liueth by the power of the creator; so the wicked shall liue: and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the habite and affection which the creature hath vnto God, the author of life; and
so the faithfull onely shall liue for euer. So euerlasting death is not so called <hi>essentially,</hi> which
consisteth in the finall dissolution of humane nature: but <gap reason="foreign">

because though they liue, they haue no communion with the life of grace, <hi>Iun. in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentar.</hi>
3. they shall awake to shame and contempt, not as the vulgar Latine, <hi>that they
may see alwaies,</hi> for the word is <hi>deraon,</hi> which signifieth contempt, loathsomenesse, as it is
taken, Isay. 66. 24. <hi>they shall goe forth, and looke vpon the carkases of those, which haue trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed,

                        <p>v. 3. <hi>They that cause (others) to vnderstand,</hi> (that is, <hi>teach others) shall shine as the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the firmament: and they that iustifie many, shall shine as the starres.</hi> These words are
diuersely expounded: whereas here a reward is promised, and they are described also to
whom this reward shall be giuen:</p>
                        <p>1. Some doe make the first and the second clause all one in sense, but set forth with vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie
of words: as <hi>Pererius</hi> thinketh that both the same excellencie of glorie is set forth by
the brightnesse of the heauens and of the starres: and they are the same, which first are said
to be wise and vnderstanding, and afterward, to iustifie many: But it is not like, that in this
prophetiall narration, beeing so concise and compendious, there should be such a multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of words, without insinuation of some further sense.</p>
                        <p>2. An other sort doe make a difference both in the reward, and in them which shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
it: and here 1. by the wise hearted or vnderstanding, <hi>Carthusianus</hi> thinketh to be
meant those onely, which are sanctified by the spirit of grace, neither hauing gifts, nor cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to teach others: and they onely shall be like the brightnesse of the firmament: but they
which iustifie others by their doctrine, and bring them vnto Christ, shall shine as the starres:
which are the brighter parts of the firmament: this sense also followe <hi>Osiander,</hi> and <hi>Pap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi>
that doe conclude from hence the diuerse degrees of glorie in the kingdome of heauen.
2. Some contrariwise, by the first vnderstand those which are teachers of others, by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
those that are onely righteous in themselues: so <hi>Lyranus,</hi> and the <hi>interlinearie glosse,</hi> &amp;
before them <hi>Theodoret</hi> following the <hi>Septuag.</hi> who read, <hi>and many iust,</hi> whereas it is in the
originall, <hi>matzedike harabbim, iustifying many:</hi> and these make the brightnesse of the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
a greater degree of glorie, then the light of the starres.</p>
                        <p>3. Some doe distinguish here the persons which shall be rewarded, but take the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
expressing the reward, the bright heauens and the starres to expresse the same thing, the
great glorie of the next life: the righteous are likened for their great glorie vnto the cleare
azure skie in the day, and to the bright shining starres in the night: But here also, 1. Some
by the first vnderstand such as teach and instruct others, as preachers and ministers; by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that iustifie, such as by discipline and good order are the meanes of the saluation of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
as godly magistrates, Parents, Schoole-masters, <hi>Bullinger.</hi> 2. some by the first doe
vnderstand the faithfull, by the second ministers and teachers, <hi>Calv. Genevens.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. Some distinguish not the persons, but diuerse parts of their office, for they are said to
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:18834:237"/>
teach, or cause others to vnderstand (for the word is <hi>maschill</hi> in hiphil) which signifieth to
cause to vnderstand, in respect of the administration of their office: in setting forth the truth,
and making them to vnderstand it: and they are said to iustifie others in regard of the worke
and effect, because by their ministerie faith is wrought in them, whereby they are iustified,
<hi>Iun. in commentar.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>5. But <hi>Polanus</hi> doth more fitly apply this text vnto martyrs (for to their consolation this
is specially ministred that should suffer in those troublesome times vnder Antiochus.) And
them he maketh of two sorts: some that by the constant confession of the truth, and suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
for the same, therein by their example did teach others: and some beside their constant
suffering, had by their godly instructions also edified many: and this commeth neerest vnto
the true sense, because as is said, this consolation is specially intended for the comfort of the
holy martyrs: Now further although in this verse, the diuerse degrees of glorie are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed:
yet in comparing it with the former verse, the diuersitie is expressed: for all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and righteous, as is before said, shall rise vnto life: but among these faithfull, these holy
teachers, and instructors of others, shall shine as the cleare heauens, and as the bright stars.</p>

                        <head>Quest. 12. How the faithfull teachers are said to iustifie
others.</head>
                        <p>That this may be the better vnderstood, we must consider the causes of our iustification,
which are these. 1. the efficient and principall cause is God himselfe, Rom. 8. 33. <hi>it is God
that iustifieth, who shall condemne?</hi> and the moouing cause was onely the mercie and loue of
God toward vs, 1. Iohn. 4. 10. <hi>herein is loue, not that we loued God, but he loued vs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. The materiall and meritorious cause is the perfect obedience of Christ, which was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
actiue or passiue, actiue either the originall and natiue righteousnesse of Christ, who
knewe no sinne, he was without all spot: or his actuall obedience through his life in keeping
the whole lawe, and the commandements of God for vs: so that which was impossible to
the lawe in vs, was fulfilled in Christ, as the Apostle sheweth, Rom. 8. 2. his passiue obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
was in suffring the most ignominious death of the crosse for vs, <hi>Philip. 2. 8. he became
obedient vnto death, euen the death of the crosse:</hi> and so did beare the curse of the law which
was due vnto vs, Galat. 3. 13.</p>
                        <p>3. The instrumentall cause on Gods behalfe is the preaching of the Gospell, whereby
faith is wrought in vs: for faith commeth by hearing, Rom. 10. 17. on our behalfe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
of our iustification is faith, whereby we apprehend the righteousnesse of Christ.</p>
                        <p>4. The ministring and vnder working or helping causes, are the teachers and preachers,
who are as ministeriall causes of our iustification, in setting forth the gospel of Christ, and
declaring the way vnto saluation: in which respect they are said to iustifie: And in this sense
also they are said to saue others: as S. Paul thus writeth to Timothie, 1. epist. c. 4. 16. <hi>take
heede vnto thy selfe and vnto doctrine, &amp;c. for in doing this thou shalt saue thy selfe, and them
that heare thee:</hi> so also S. Iames saith, 5. 20. <hi>he that conuerteth a sinner, shall saue a soule
from death, &amp;c.</hi>

but it is the same vision continued: as both the circumstance of the place sheweth, it was by
the same riuer Tigris, mentioned before c. 10. 5. and of the person, the man clothed in linen
before also described: and the question demanded is concerning the continuance of those
wonders and strange things before spoken of.</p>
                        <p>2. These two Angels <hi>Hierome</hi> thinketh to haue beene the one the Angel that stood for
Persia, the other that was President of Grecia, which did hinder the deliuerance of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes:
But it is euident, that these Angels stand for the people of God: for as affected with
the troubles which here are prophesied to come vpon Gods people, they desire to know the
time of the beginning and ende of them.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> thinketh, that here were not three in all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but one more came vnto
him that had talked with Daniel all this while: and they are said to be two other, because <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio

that they were three: for two stood by the brinke of the riuer, one on the one side, and one
on the other, and the third was vpon the waters.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>R. Levi</hi> thinketh that one of these two was Gabriel: but Gabriel was he, which had
this communication with Daniel all this while, and now two other appeare: they had not
beene other two, if there had beene but one beside Gabriel. <hi>Polan.</hi>

out of <hi>Hierome</hi> by these two Angels standing vpon the riuers banke, interpreteth the
flourishing and standing of the <hi>Persian</hi> and <hi>Greeke</hi> Monarchie: and by the third vpon the
waters of the riuer, the troublesome state of the Church: for so in Scripture afflictions are
signified by waters. But hereby rather is signified, in that the Angels stand on this side and
on that side, the readie administration of the Angels, which are alwaies at hand to expedite
the commandement of God. <hi>Polan.</hi>

                        <p>1. The most generall and receiued opinion here is, that this third Angel of whome the
question is asked, was Gabriel: <hi>Lyran. Pint. Perer. Bulling.</hi> with others: But how could one
Angel aske and learne of an other? seeing they are all ministring spirits, and doe all fetch
their light and knowledge from the same fountaine Christ Iesus the reuealer of secrets. <hi>M.
Calvin</hi> here answereth, <hi>Est aliquod discrimen inter Angelos, sed non perpetuum,</hi> that there is
some difference betweene the Angels, but not perpetuall, onely for a time: his meaning is,
that God may at some time giue greater illumination to one Angel then to an other, and so
one Angel may receiue direction of an other. But the Angels rather receiue their direction
from Christ, who is that <hi>Palmoni,</hi> one that hath secrets in account, and number: of whome
an Angel likewise enquireth, c. 8. 13.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Pintus</hi> thinketh that these three Angels doe signifie the Trinitie, the two Angels that
stood by the riuer, represent the Father and the holy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Sonne of God: as the three Angels which appeared to Abraham, Gen. 18. did likewise
represent the Trinitie. But 1. in that one of the two Angels asketh of the third as his supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour,
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:18834:239"/>
they can not signifie the Trinitie, for this would argue an inequalitie in those most
glorious persons. 2. One of those three, which appeared to Abraham, was Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
whome Abraham there praieth vnto, and calleth him <hi>Iehovah:</hi> the other two were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
ministring Angels, which afterward went to Sodome, and were receiued into Lots
house.</p>
                        <p>3. But this man which was cloathed in linen, was none other then Christ himselfe: 1.
because he is the same, which so appeared before, c. 10. 4. which was Christ, as in that place
hath beene shewed. 2. he is the reuealer of secrets, and of him the Angel asked the like
question before, c. 8. 13. 3. this vision is interpreted by the like, Apoc. 10. 1. where a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
Angel came downe from heauen, with a rainbow about his head, and his face was as the
Sunne, he stood vpon the land and the Sea, signifying his power ouer both, and lift vp his
hand to heauen; as this Angel here standeth vpon the waters, and lifteth vp both his hands
to heauen: but that great Angel was Christ: the similitude of the vision argueth the <hi>identitie</hi>
of the same person. 4. and beside his standing vpon the water doth signifie, <hi>quod olim super
Iordanem testimonium accepturus,</hi> that in time to come he should receiue testimonie from
heauen vpon the waters of Iordan.</p>
                        <p>But it will be obiected, that this was not Christ, because he lifteth vp his hand, and swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
by God: but he that one sweareth by, is greater. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Christ appearing as a
man, is here to be considered both as God and man, and so as man is inferiour vnto God, and
sweareth by a greater. 2. or rather Christ as God sweareth by himselfe, as one euerliuing
God with his father, but a distinct person: so that this oath is the same in effect with that,
Deut. 32. 40. <hi>I lift vp my hand to heauen, and sweare for euer: sic vides quod iurat per seip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum,
&amp;c.</hi> so you see that he sweareth by himselfe, touching the heauens with his hand, and
setting his feete vpon the water and land, shewing his dominion therein: <hi>Oecolampad.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And in that he lifteth vp both his hands, whereas vsually in taking an oath one hand is

is for the more full confirmation of these things, <hi>Bulling. &amp; voluit hoc modo exponere rei

                        <p>Of the first sort: 1. some doe thinke, that the time of the afflictions of the people of God,

                        </p>
                        <p>3. But some contrariwise here vnderstand a long time, <hi>tempus hic ponitur pro longo tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctu,
tempora, pro longiore tractu,</hi> here (time) is put for a long tract or continuance, (times) for
a longer. <hi>M. Calv. Genevens.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now all these opinions are confuted by these reasons. 1. because the same phrase of <hi>a
time, two times, and a part of time,</hi> are taken before, c. 7. 25. for a certaine and definite
tearme, therefore it is like to be so taken here. 2. this time is diuided, <hi>a part of time,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is a certaine and definite number: for that which is vncertaine and indefinite vseth not
to be deuided into parts. 3. And what comfort had there beene in this prescription and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of time, if there were giuen no certaine direction, how long this troublesome time
should continue.</p>
                        <p>4. Of the second sort: some take this for a certaine number of yeares, whereof some vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
by daies yeares, some so many daies literally: by a time, two times, and an halfe,
which make yeares three, and an halfe or a part, that is, daies 1225. or thereabout, are signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
so many yeares 1200. and odde: which <hi>Melancthon</hi> beginneth from Daniels time,

whereof 600. yeares were expired vnto Christ, and about 600. yeares after the sect of the

                        <p>5. <hi>Osiander</hi> beginneth this tearme, where <hi>Melancthon</hi> endeth it, and continueth it vnto

that their Antichrist shall beare sway longer in the whole: yet the heate of his most cruell
and outragious persecution shall continue but 3. yeares and an halfe. But this interpretation
is refused vpon the former reason, because this prophesie concerned the holy people of
God, that then was: and beside, that imagination of some one singular person to rise vp to
be Antichrist, is but a fabulous and phantasticall conceit, as is before shewed, c. 11. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trov.
2.</p>
                        <p>7. This time then here prescribed and limited, precisely signifieth three yeares, and an
halfe, or rather part of time: for so long continued the desolation of the Sanctuarie vnder
Antiochus: which beganne in the 145. yeare, the 15. day of the moneth <hi>Casteu,</hi> 1. Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chab.
1. 57. and ended in the 148. yeare on the 25. day of the same moneth, 1. Macchab. 4.

                        <p>But against this exposition, which <hi>Porphyrius</hi> also did hit vpon, <hi>Hierome</hi> thus obiecteth:
1. if the time, two times, and an halfe, that is, three yeares and an halfe, must be referred vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Antiochus, whereof mention is made before, c. 7. 25. then that which followeth also in

of the most high, &amp;c. and all Princes shall serue him,</hi> must be applied either to Antiochus,
or to the people of the Iewes: which is manifestly false. 2. the defolation of the Temple
continued but three yeares, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> writeth, <hi>l. 12. c.</hi> 10. but this tearme is of three yeares
and an halfe. 3. <hi>Lyranus</hi> obiecteth, that the persecution vnder Antiochus continued sixe

of Antiochus, or of the Iewes, who neuer ruled ouer the whole world: for there

whome raigning spiritually in his Church (there called the holy people) the kingdome
should be giuen ouer the whole earth. 2. The word <hi>chatzi,</hi> signifieth not onely the halfe,
but the part of a thing: as the same is expressed by an other word <hi>pelag, c.</hi> 7. 25. which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
a diuision: and so indeede the desolation of the Temple continued iust 3. yeares, and a
part of a yeare, namely tenne daies, as is before shewed: therefore <hi>Iosephus</hi> is deceiued, which
maketh account but of three yeares: for there were tenne daies aboue. 3. The persecution
vnder Antiochus was either of the citie, with spoiling also and robbing onely of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
or in laying wast the Sanctuarie, and causing the daily oblation to cease: the first conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
aboue sixe yeares, euen 2300. daies, as is prophesied c. 8. 14. but the other endured
onely three yeares and ten daies: so these diuers persecutions, had their diuers tearmes: and
both may well stand together.</p>
                        <p>Some thinke that this tearme of 3. yeares and an halfe, sheweth the tearme of Christs
persecution in the daies of his flesh, which was iust so many yeares: <hi>M. Br.</hi> this prophesie

                        <p>6. Wherefore, that which he called before, a time, two times, and an halfe, is here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
to be 1290. dayes, that is 3. yeares, 7. moneths, and about 13. dayes, which must
beginne from the profanation of the Temple by Antiochus, which was in the 145. yeare, the
15. of <hi>Casleu,</hi> which was the ninth moneth, 1. Mac. 1. 57. and must ende 45. dayes before
Antiochus death.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Iunius</hi> setteth downe the time precisely, when the 1290. dayes ended, in the 15. day of
the moneth <hi>Xanthicus,</hi> which is the 11. moneth, in 48. yeare, when Antiochus by his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
edict and writing confirmed and ratified the Iewes religion, restored by Iudas Maccha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beus:
But the time will not agree, if we beginne from the profanation of the Temple, from
the 15. of the 9. moneth <hi>Casleu</hi> in the 45. yeare, from whence to the 15. of the 11. moneth
<hi>Xanticus</hi> in the 48. yeare, are but 3. yeares and iust 2. moneths: therefore <hi>Iunius</hi> in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie
to helpe this, beginneth the profanation of the Temple in the 15. day of the 4.
moneth, in the 145. yeare, and citeth 1. Macchab. 1. and so the time will agree: but
there the moneth <hi>Casleu</hi> is named, 1. macchab. 1. 57. which was the ninth not the 4.
moneth, 1. Macchab. 4. 52. therefore I rather with <hi>Polanus,</hi> thinke that the 1290. dayes,
determine at such time as Iudas Macchabeus had prosperous successe against the Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites
with their captaine Timotheus, after he had cleansed the Temple, and Antiochus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
was forced to suffer the Iewes to enioy their libertie and religion, and this was 45.

                        <p>1. This tearme of 45. dayes added to the former number, of a 1290. dayes, maketh it
a 1335. dayes: so many dayes after the death and slaughter of Antichrist shall Christ come
in his maiestie, <hi>Hierome,</hi> with whom consenteth herein <hi>Pererius,</hi> and the Romanists in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
because they thinke by this meanes to free the Pope from this imputation, to be Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ:
But this opinion cannot stand. 1. they cannot assigne the right cause, why these 45.
dayes should be giuen after the death of Antichrist: <hi>Theodoret</hi> thinketh that in this space
Henoch and Elias shall preach vnto the world: but <hi>Hyppolitus</hi> holdeth, and so the Romanists
generally, that they shall be slaine by Antichrist: some thinke this respite shall be giuen for
the repentance of the world: but 45. dayes is a small tearme for repentance: God gaue the
old world an 120. yeares for their repentance. 2. if Christ shall come to iudge the world
iust 45. dayes after the death of Antichrist, then the verie day of Christs comming may be
knowne before, which is contrarie to the Scripture. 3. <hi>Lyranus</hi> thus argueth, that whereas
at the comming of Christ there shall be great peace and securitie, eating and drinking, and
feasting, this great securitie would aske a larger space then of 45. dayes.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Lyranus</hi> noteth, that some Hebrewes take these dayes for so many yeares, that after
the setting vp of that abhomination in the Temple, there should be a 1335. yeares to the
comming of their Messiah: But they are herein much deceiued: for if they reckon from the
setting vp of the idol by Antiochus in the Temple, which was, as <hi>Eusebius</hi> counteth, in the
153. Olympiad, there are runne aboue a 1700. yeares: if from the last setting vp of the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of <hi>Adrian,</hi> which was in the yeare of the Lord an 140. according to <hi>Eusebius,</hi> then
are there expired aboue a 1460. yeares from thence.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>M. Calvin</hi> thinketh that this addition of 45. dayes, signifieth no certaine time: but
onely hereby is signified, that although the time seeme to be prolonged for the deliuerance
of the Church, yet the godly should waite with patience: so also, <hi>Oecolampad. Pellican.</hi>
But this adding and putting to of one number to another, euidently sheweth, that a certaine
summe of yeares or dayes is intended.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Melancthon</hi> putteth both these numbers of a 1290. and a 1335. together, which
make 7. yeares and three moneths: which tearme he beginneth in 145. yeare of the Greeks,
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:18834:242"/>
and endeth in the 151. yeare, when <hi>Nicanor</hi> was ouercome: But these two numbers haue
the same beginning from the time that the daily sacrifice should cease.</p>
                        <p>5. Some by these two summes put together, vnderstand so many yeares, namely, two
thousand six hundred and odde: whereof 6. hundred were expired at Christs comming, and
two thousand should runne out afterward: But who can define whether the world shall yet
continue 400. yeares, the day, yeare, or houre is not reuealed.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi>Osiander</hi> thinketh this last summe of a 1335. yeares to be set for the continuance of
the kingdome of Antichrist, vnderstanding so many yeares: but he thinketh it is not known

                        <p>7. <hi>Bullinger</hi> taketh these 45. dayes to beginne from the taking of the citie: for immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
after, many were sold into captiuitie, condemned vnto the mines and stone quarries,
some reserued for triumph: therefore he should be thought an happie man, that suruiued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

the Temple. 4. and there is mentioned a fourth time of a 1335. dayes, which endeth at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus

of torment: as is shewed in the parable of the rich glutton, Luke. 16. But this is the priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

that he speaketh of his standing vp in the resurrection: because mention is made before of
his rest. 2. he shall stand vp: for the wicked beeing condemned of their owne conscience,
shall not be able to stand in iudgement, Psal. 1. 5. But the righteous shall stand forth and

here are three things shewed concerning Christ: 1. his person, he is called <hi>Michael,</hi> that

that article of our faith concerning the resurrection of the dead: the like hath Iob.
19. 26. Isay. 26. 19. Ezech. 37. 12. and this is the first place in the old Testament, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
euident mention is made of eternall life.</p>
                        <p>2. The diuerse state and condition is described of those which shall rise againe, some vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
euerlasting life, and some to perpetuall shame: as our Sauiour saith in the same manner,
Ioh. 5. 29. <hi>they shall come forth (of their graues) that haue done good, vnto the resurrection
of life, but they that haue done euill vnto the resurrection of condemnation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. The easines and facilitie of this work is shewed with God: that it is no more for him to
raise the body out of the graue, then for the body to awake fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sleep, &amp; to rise out of the bed:
&amp; so the righteous are said to rest in their beds, that is, in their graues, Isa. 57. 2. sleepe then is
an image of death, then the awaking from sleepe, should put vs in mind of our resurrection,
and assure vs thereof: as <hi>Tertullian</hi> well saith, <hi>cum evigilaverit corpus redditum officijs eius,

putteth it out of doubt, where the word <hi>tamar</hi> is vsed, which is a palme tree: see more
concerning the <hi>Phoenix, Hexapl. in Gen. c. 7. quest.</hi> 7. We haue better arguments to assure
vs of the resurrection, then this from the <hi>Phoenix. Bullinger,</hi> because mention is made of
sleeping in the dust, whereout man was taken at the first, doth hence gather an other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the resurrection, because it is as possible for the Lord to raise the bodie out of the
dust of the earth, as he created it at the first out of the dust.</p>
                        <p>4. The qualitie of the bodie is shewed, what it shall be in the resurrection, <hi>they shall
shine as the brightnesse of the firmament:</hi> some qualities of the bodie are essentiall vnto it,
without the which it cannot be, as to be visible, to be palpable, to haue parts, as the head,

essentiall, but not naturall, as to be hungrie, thirstie, heauie, wearie, of a grosse or thick sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,

nor Elias are here named: for these 1260. dayes beeing taken prophetically for so many
yeares, two Prophets could not continue preaching so long. 2. that place in Malachie our
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:18834:244"/>
Blessed Sauiour expoundeth of <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> Matth. 11. who should come in the spirit of
<hi>Elias, to turne the hearts of the fathers to the children,</hi> as the Angel saith, Luk. 1. 17. And
the first comming of Christ is there vnderstood to be that fearefull day: for in the same place
the Prophet saith, v. 2. <hi>vnto you that feare my name shall the Sunne of righteousnesse arise:</hi>
which <hi>Zacharie</hi> applyeth to the first comming of Christ, Luk. 1. 78. <hi>whereby the day
spring from an high hath visited vs:</hi> It shall be a day of health and saluation vnto the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
but a day of terror to the wicked and vnbeleeuers, as Iohn Baptist saith, Mat. 3. 12. <hi>which
hath his fanne in his hand, and will make cleane his floore, and gather his wheate into his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
but will burne vp the chaffe with vnquencheable sire.</hi> 3. And by the shutting of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
is by an allegorie signified the efficacie of the preaching of the Gospel, in opening the
heauens to the faithfull, and shutting vp the same to all vnbeleeuers, as our Sauiour faith to
Peter, Matth. 16. 19. <hi>whatsoeuer thou shalt bind in earth, shall be bound in heauen, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
thou shalt loose in earth, shall be loosed in heauen.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, concerning these witnesses, there is great difference and varietie of opinion,
1. both for the number of them. 2. and who they shall be. 3. and when they shall preach:
for the first: the common opinion is, that they shall be but two: yet <hi>Lactantius</hi> affirmeth,
that there shall be onely one Prophet, <hi>lib. 7. c.</hi> 17. Some thinke there shall be three, <hi>Henoch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Elias,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> the Euangelist, and this is one of their reasons: because as in the world there
haue beene 3. lawes in force, the lawe of nature, the lawe of Moses, the lawe of grace; so it
is requisite there should be 3. witnesses that liued vnder these three lawes, Henoch, Elias,
and Iohn: <hi>Hyppolit. oration. de consum. secul. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>As great diuersitie there is of opinion, who these witnesses should be: Elias is agreed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by the most, to be one: but it is doubted who should be the other: <hi>Victorinus in Apocal.</hi>
11. thinketh, that Ieremie the Prophet shall be the other witnesse: because the Lord saith
Ierem 1. 5. <hi>I haue ordained thee a Prophet vnto the nations:</hi> but then Ieremias onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied
to the Hebrewes: to fulfill therefore that saying, he shall come in the ende of the
world to prophesie vnto the nations: But <hi>Pererius</hi> well answeareth vnto this reason: that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie
is said to prophesie vnto the nations; because he fortelleth the destruction in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie
of diuerse nations, the <hi>Aegyptians, Moabites, Ammonites, Philistims,</hi> with others:
<hi>Areta</hi> vpon the Apocalypse thinketh, that <hi>Iohn</hi> the euangelist shall be one of the witnesses,
whom they suppose yet to be kept aliue in Paradise with Henoch and Elias, because it is said
Apocal. 10. 11. <hi>thou must prophesie againe among the people, and nations, and tongues, and
to many Kings:</hi> which was not done in Iohns life time, and therefore he thinketh he shall
come in the ende of the world, to prophesie vnto nations: But the meaning of this place is,
that Iohn should prophesie vnto nations in the rest of the visions of this booke: and nowe
though Iohn be dead, his Reuelation prophesieth still: <hi>Pererius</hi> also vnderstandeth it of the
Gospel, which Iohn did write after his returne from the Isle <hi>Pathmos,</hi> whereby he prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieth
vnto nations. But it is certaine, that Iohn is not yet aliue in the flesh: as <hi>Eusebius</hi> proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
by the testimonie of <hi>Polycrates,</hi> who was the Apostles disciple, <hi>lib. 3. Ecclesi. histor. c. 25.
Lyranus</hi> thinketh that the two witnesses spoken of Apocal. 11. were <hi>Sylverius</hi> the Pope
and <hi>Menna</hi> that resisted the <hi>Eutychiane</hi> heresie. <hi>Ioachimus Abbas,</hi> and <hi>Gagnaeus,</hi> vpon the
Apocalypse, c. 11. doe thinke that Moses shall be one of these witnesses: that like as he was
raised to life to be a witnesse of Christs first comming, when he was transfigured in the
mount, so he shall be raised to be a witnesse of his second comming. And this is brought
as a probabilitie thereof: because these witnesses are said to haue power ouer waters to turne
them into blood, Apocal. 11. 6. which thing Moses had done before.</p>
                        <p>But 1. it followeth not because Moses was seene in the mount talking with Christ, that
therefore he shall come againe before his second comming: for by the same reason it may be
inferred, that his three disciples also which went vp to the mount, and sawe him transfigured,
should also be witnesses of his second comming, &amp; be sent againe into the world to preach:
Sure it is that both the Prophets and Apostles shall accompanie Christ in his second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
and by the doctrine, which they preached, iudge and condemne the world, Matth.
19. 28. But neither the one nor the other shall be raised vp before the generall resurrection,
and sent into the world to preach. 2. by the turning of waters into blood, is vnderstood the
threatening of Gods iudgements for the contempt of the ministerie of the word.</p>
                        <p>3. A third vncertaintie there is concerning the time of the preaching of these two witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:
<hi>Theodoret</hi> thinketh that Elias shall preach 45. dayes after that Antichrist is slaine: and
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:18834:244"/>
therefore it is said, v. 12. blessed is he that shall come to the 1335. daies, which is 45. daies
more then the former summe of 1290. daies. But <hi>Hyppolitus</hi> thinketh that Antichrist shall
put to death Henoch and Elias, after they haue preached 3. yeares and an halfe: and that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their death, Antichrist shall raigne 3. yeares and an halfe more. <hi>Bellar. lib. 3. de Rom. Pont.</hi>
thinketh that these two Prophets shall preach 3. yeares and an halfe, that is, 1260. daies, a
<hi>cap.</hi> 8. moneth before Antichrist is slaine, who shall raigne a 1290. daies. This vncertentie
sheweth, this to be but a Iewish fable, and a meere imagination of the comming of Henoch
and Elias in person in the ende of the world to preach.</p>

Antichrist.</head>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Pererius</hi> thus farre proceedeth well in describing the grieuous persecution which shall be
vnder Antichrist, that it shall not be onely corporall and externall in tormenting of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
but it shall be also spirituall in abolishing all exercise of religion: he shall burne the
bookes of the Scripture, and burne the righteous together with those bookes: he shall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
the vse of the Sacraments; and as <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, there shall be great difficultie in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
of the infants of Christians: <hi>lib. 20. de civitat. Dei, c.</hi> 8. the sacraments shall not pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
be administred, but priuately. All this is most true, and euery one of these things hath
thus come to passe vnder the tyrannie of Antichrist: the true seruice of God was abolished,
and prayer in an vnknowne tongue brought into the Church: they haue burned the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
with bookes of Scripture and of godly prayers together: as is set forth in the storie of
the burning of Bucer and Fagius bones, and one Hilliard at Cambridge: the Christians chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
could be hardly baptized, but after their superstitious manner, as the historie of M.
Haukes martyr sheweth.</p>
                        <p>But herein <hi>Pererius</hi> is deceiued: he thinketh that Antichrist shall take away all images,
neither shall suffer any man to signe him with the signe of the crosse, but shall abolish that
signe out of euery place.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. It is certen that Antichrist rather shall set vp images and idols of siluer and
gold: as in the Revelation, c. 9. 20. after the opening of the sixth and last trumpet saue one,
toward the ende of the world, mention is made of those that worshipped idols of siluer and
gold, of brasse, &amp;c. and had not repented: now there are none knowne worshippers of
such idols in these daies in these part of the world, vnder the Romane Empire, but the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists.</p>
                        <p>2. And Antichrist, as he shall couer his hypocrisie with the name of Christ, so he shall
not abolish the signe of Christs crosse, but still rather superstitiously abuse it: robbing Christ
indeede of his due honour, and giuing him reuerence onely in outward shewes and signes:
as the Iewes clothed Christ in purple, and did obeisance to him in mocking: So that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the marke of the beast, we vnderstand with <hi>Iunius</hi> the Popish chrysme, which in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
is laid on with the signe of the crosse vpon forehead and hand: or with <hi>Napier</hi> the

shall not abolish all such signes, but abuse them rather to superstition and idolatrie.</p>

obiected, Exod. 32. 32, 33. Moses saith vnto God, <hi>if not rase me out of the booke which thou

Psal. 69. 29. <hi>Let him be put out of the booke of the liuing, and let him not be written with the

                        <p>
                           <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. We refuse here the opinion of <hi>Ambros. Catharinus, lib. de praedest.</hi> that maketh
two orders of those which shall come to euerlasting life: one of such as are predestinate bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
excellent and worthie men; an other of such as are not elected, that is, by the grace of
God ordained to saluation, yet through Gods mercie shall be saued. But this opinion is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
to the Scriptures, which testifie, that whosoeuer is not written in the booke of life,
shall be cast into the lake of fire, Apoc. 20. 15.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Thomas Aquin.</hi> here hath this distinction,<note place="margin">Thom. 1. part. qu. 24. ar. 3.</note> that some are saide to be written in the
booke of life, <hi>simpliciter,</hi> simply, such as are in deede predestinate according to the good
purpose of God, and these can neuer be blotted out: others are written <hi>secundum quid,</hi> after
a sort, in respect of their present iustice, these may be blotted out: And as these in respect of
their present state may be saide to be written in the booke, so the elect indeede may in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
likewise of their present state, while they remaine in sinne, be saide to be blotted out:
And therefore some thinke that the booke which was shewed vnto Ezekiel, was written
within and without, in the inside were written onely those, who should be saued, on the
backside they which are written onely there for a time.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. This distinction may well be admitted, if some be saide to be written in the
booke in respect of their owne opinion, and outward appearance: but none can be said to be
there written by God: for as the Preacher saith, Eccles. 3. 14. <hi>I know, that whatsoeuer God
shall doe, it shall be for euer:</hi> his workes are perfect, therefore he writeth not any there, and
blotteth them out againe.</p>
                        <p>3. Wherefore the best solution is this: that God is said to blot out, not properly, but by
a certaine similitude, as he is saide in Scripture, to repent, to be angrie: they are blotted out,
that is, the Lord declareth by the euent, that they were neuer written there: as <hi>Augustine</hi>
well saith, <hi>hoc dictum est secundum spem ipsorum,</hi> this is saide in respect of their hope, they
tooke themselues to be written there: and they are saide accordingly to be blotted out, that
is, <hi>non ibi se script<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

there in deede. <hi>August. in Psal.</hi> 68. So the Scripture sometime speaketh, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>,
according to the opinion of men: as Matth. 8. 12. the children of the kingdome shall be cast
out into darknes: and Matth. 9. 12. <hi>I come not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance:</hi>
here they are called the children of the kingdome, and the righteous, in respect of their own
opinion, and others, not that they were so in deede: And so some making a glorious shew
for the time of righteousnes, seeme to themselues and others to be written in Gods booke,
and yet are not. <hi>Pellican.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But yet a further doubt is mooued, concerning Moses words, that wished to be rased out
of Gods booke: he was there written in deede, and therefore this solution will not serue
here: of this now more in the next place.</p>

                        <p>2. <hi>Basil</hi> thinketh that Moses and Paul in thus desiring, were not ignorant that they
could not be separated from God in thus praying, it proceeding from so great charitie: but
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:18834:245"/>
they rather hoped to receiue so much the more at Gods hand for it: <hi>in libr. regular.</hi> But if
they had thus praied onely of this minde, they had respected themselues more then the
glorie of God.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>August. queast. 140. in Exod.</hi> thinketh, that this wish of Moses proceeded <hi>ex ingenti
quadam divinae familiaritatis securitate,</hi> from a wonderfull securitie and familiar assurance
that he had with God: and he maketh this to be the effect of Moses speach; either forgiue
the people this sinne, or blot me out: but I am assured, thou wilt not blot me out: therefore
forgiue them. But the Lords answer, <hi>I will blot out him whosoeuer sinneth,</hi> sheweth that
Moses wish was to be blotted out, and he sheweth not his assurance in so wishing, not to
be blotted out.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Bernard</hi> thinketh that this wish came <hi>à paterno affectu,</hi> from a fatherly affection, <hi>ne
solus ipse, excluso populo, &amp;c.</hi> that he alone without the people would not attaine vnto euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting

                        <p>5. <hi>Rupert. lib. 3. in Exod.</hi> giueth this sense; either forgiue them, or els it must needes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that I also be blotted out of thy booke, because I am likewise a sinner: But this had
shewed some diffidence and doubtfulnes in Moses of his owne saluation.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi>Hugo in Psal.</hi> 138. maketh two bookes of life, one of the present state of iustice, out
of the which Moses wisheth to be rased out, the other the booke of predestination: But this
had beene to tempt God, to wish to fall from the state of grace into sinne.</p>
                        <p>7. <hi>Caietane</hi> thinketh the meaning to be but this, that he desireth to be blotted <hi>de libro
principatus,</hi> out of the booke and decree of his principalitie and gouernment: to loose that
princely office, ouer the Lords people, which God had assigned him vnto.</p>
                        <p>8. And <hi>R. Salamon Ioachi</hi> much to the same purpose, vnderstandeth by the booke, the
<hi>Pentateuch,</hi> out of the which Moses wisheth his name to be blotted, that is, no mention to
be made of his name, or of his acts therein: But Gods answer taketh away both these inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations,
<hi>him that sinneth wil I blot out of my book:</hi> but in the Pentateuch the names of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
sinners are written. And Moses only had the principality appointed vnto him for his time,
there was none other written there but he: but God speaketh of the blotting out of others.</p>
                        <p>9. <hi>Lyranus</hi> thinketh, that as Christ <hi>secundum voluntatem partis sensitivae,</hi> in the will of
his sensitiue part desired the cuppe to passe, <hi>quem voluntas rationalis appetebat,</hi> which the
will of his reason desired: so Moses here, <hi>secundum desiderium partis inferioris,</hi> in the desire
of the inferiour part of his minde, (that is, his will and affection) wisheth to be blotted out,
though in his superiour part, that is, in his iudgement, he would not haue it so. But this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
is not alike, for the desire in Christ to escape death was naturall; but this wish of
Moses to perish not onely temporally, but eternally, was supernaturall: and to wish one
thing one way, and not an other way, includeth a contradiction.</p>
                        <p>10. <hi>Alphons. Abulens. in Exod.</hi> thinketh it is an <hi>hyperbolical</hi> speech, and not literally

that <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Paul, tanto Dei amore flagrabant, &amp;c.</hi> did burne with such loue and
zeale to the glorie of God, that in respect thereof, <hi>Deo ipso frui pro nihilo reputarunt,</hi> they
made no account of the fruition of God himselfe: <hi>hoc erat eorum propositum, ne Deus ab ipsis
summe dilectus, irrideretur ab impijs,</hi> this was the purpose and scope of their desire, least God
whome they dearely loued, should haue beene laughed to scorne and derided of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked:
which Moses feared would haue beene, if the Lord should at this time haue destroied
his people: as Moses had declared before in his praier, Exod. 32. 12. <hi>Wherefore shall the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians
speake and say, He hath brought them out miraculously to slay them in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines.</hi>

But 1. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is much deceiued: for they hold no such thing: it was the opinion of
one of the Popes, <hi>Iohn</hi> 22. which is thus reported by <hi>Hadrian</hi> the 6. an other of their Popes,
<hi>in 4. sententiar. de sacram. confirm. artic. 3. Ioannes 22. publice docuit, &amp;c.</hi> Iohn the 22. did
publikely teach, and commanded also to hold, <hi>quod animae purgatae ante sinale iudicium non
habent stolam, quae est clara &amp; facialis visio Dei,</hi> that the soules beeing purged receiue not
their stoale or garment before the finall iudgement, which is the cleare vision of God face to
face, &amp;c. 2. This his error might seeme to be grounded out of this text, <hi>they that sleepe in
the dust shall awake:</hi> but this is euidently spoken of their bodies, which are laid in the graue
and dust of the earth: which are said to sleepe, because their bodies doe but rest there for a
time, they shall be raised againe. But that the soules of the beleeuing doe presently passe out
of their bodies vnto heauen, is manifest by the answer of our Sauiour vnto the theefe, <hi>This
day shalt thou be with me in Paradise:</hi> out of which place <hi>Gerson</hi> Chauncelour of the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie
of Paris, in an oration before the states of France, inferreth, <hi>Latronem &amp;c. beatifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum

penance, was made blessed in the very houre of his death. <hi>Gaguin. histor. Francor. lib.</hi> 8. 3.
The truth then is this, that the soules of the faithfull departed are presently taken vp vnto
rest: but yet their glorie shall be more full and absolute, when the bodies together with
soules shall be glorified in the resurrection: as S. Peter faith, 1. epist. 5. 4. <hi>When the chiefe
shepheard shall appeare, ye shall receiue an incorruptible crowne of glorie.</hi> So the Angels that
fell, are said to be kept in chaines of darknes vnto damnation, 2. Pet. 2. 4. they are alreadie
damned, but yet they shall haue a further consummation of iudgement at the last day. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the wicked are said to goe into euerlasting fire in the day of iudgement, Matth. 25. 46.
and yet presently after death their soules goe vnto the place of torment, Luk. 16. 23.</p>

many places in Scripture, are hard to be vnderstood: neither do we giue libertie to ouery one
to expound the Scripture as they list. 2. But this we affirme, that the doctrine of faith and of

times, and an halfe: which is defined to be a 1260. daies, Apoc. 11. 3. and 12. 6. But the
Pope hath raigned in the Church now more then 1500. yeares at the least: therefore the
Pope is not that Antichrist. <hi>Bellarm. lib. 3. de Rom. pontif. c.</hi> 8.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The proposition is false: for this place of Daniel is vnderstood of Antiochus,
that so long the Sanctuarie should lie prophaned and polluted by him: he was indeede a
type of Antichrist, but not in euery respect, as namely in the time and continuance of his ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie:
types doe not answer in euery respect vnto the thing that is shadowed forth, but
onely in that wherein they are types: as Dauid and Salomon were types of Christ, yet it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
not, that Christs kingdome shall continue but 40. yeares, because they raigned no
longer.</p>
                        <p>2. That tearme of a 1260. daies, mentioned in the Apocalyps, <hi>Polanus</hi> taketh to signifie
that time precisely, namely 3. yeares and an halfe, when the Church of Christ fled from Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem
vnto a towne called <hi>Pella,</hi> where they were preserued, during which time the citie
was besieged, and at the last taken and destroied: but these daies are rather taken propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
for so many yeares, 1260. during which time the mysterie of iniquitie did worke in
the Church: which tearme some beginne in the yeare 300. so <hi>Napier</hi> vpon the Reuelation,
<hi>propos. 36. Iunius</hi> also taketh those daies for so many yeares, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 11. 3.</p>
                        <p>3. In that he saith the Pope hath raigned 1500. yeares in the Church, therein he confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
that the Pope is the Antichrist, that taketh vpon him to raigne in the Church: whereas
S. Peter saith, 1. ep. 5. 3. <hi>Not as though ye were Lords ouer</hi> (Gods) <hi>inheritance.</hi> And thus also is
euident by his confession, that the said tearme of a 1260. daies taken for yeares, and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in the yeare 300. will make that summe of 1500. and somewhat more.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Argum.</hi> When Antichrist commeth, all externall ceremonies of religion shall cease,
and the publike worship of God: but so is it not vnder the Pope: for they haue the daily sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of the Masse: <hi>Ergo. Bellarm. lib. 3. c.</hi> 7.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Whereas it is here said, v. 11. <hi>That the daily sacrifice shall be taken away:</hi> it is vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
not of Antichrist, but of Antiochus, who in deede caused the daily sacrifice to cease: as
the author of the bookes of the Macchabees taketh it, 1. Macchab. 1. 57. and <hi>Ioseph. lib. 2.
antiquit. c.</hi> 10. so also <hi>Chrysostome</hi> expoundeth, and <hi>Hierome</hi> vpon the 11. chap. v. 30, 31.</p>
                        <p>2. Neither is it true, that all outward ceremonies of religion shall cease vnder Antichrist:
for he shall fit in the Temple of God, and so reteine some outward markes of Christian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
as baptisme, and yet in deede be an enemie to the Christian faith.</p>
                        <p>3. Though in the reformed Church there is (thankes be to God) publike exercise of the
right sernice of God; yet vnder the Papacie, the true worship of God is abolished: idolatrie,
invocation of Saints, and other strange worships are brought in.</p>
                        <p>4. The Masse is not that daily sacrifice here spoken of, it is rather that abominable idol,
which abrogateth the vertue of Christs sacrifice vpon the crosse, and maketh the oblation of
a peece of hallowed bread a sacrifice propitiatorie for the quicke and the dead.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Argum. They which goe about to abrogate the sacrifice of the Eucharist, are the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners
of Antichrist: but the Protestants, not the Papists abolish the sacrifice of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist:
Ergo. Bellar. ibid.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The Protestants doe obserue and keepe the true institution of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
called the Eucharist: which they celebrate as an Eucharisticall and commemoratiue sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifie,
not as propitiatiue, as the Papists doe: for <hi>Christ hath with one offring consecrated for
euer, them, that are sanctified,</hi> Heb. 10. 14. therefore he was not to offer himselfe vp often,
Heb. 9. 25. we vse it as a commemoration of Christs sacrifice, according to his owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement:
<hi>doe this as oft as ye doe it in remembrance of me:</hi> Thus <hi>Theodoret</hi> writeth, hauing
mooued this question, <hi>cur noui testamenti sacerdotes mysticum sacrisicium peragunt, &amp;c.</hi>
why the Priests or ministers of the newe testament doe celebrate a mysticall sacrifice, seeing
Christ by his sacrifice, hath made other sacrifices not now to be necessarie: <hi>clarum est ijs, qui
in rebus diuiuis sunt eruditi, nos non aliud offerre, sed illius vnius &amp; salutaris memoriam pera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere,</hi>
it is well knowne to those which are skilfull in diuine things, that we offer no other sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
but celebrate a memorie of that one healthfull sacrifice: for this the Lord himselfe
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:18834:247"/>
commanded, <hi>doe this in remembrance of me, &amp;c.</hi> so <hi>Theodoret</hi> in c. 8. <hi>ad Hebraeos.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. But the Papists indeede haue abrogated the true vse of the Eucharist; turning bread
into flesh, a Sacrament into a sacrifice, a commemoration into an oblation, eating and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
into gazing, and shaking to and fro, and lifting vp: in stead of worshipping God, ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
a peice of bread: and such like profanations haue they brought in of the Lords Supper.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Argum. 45. dayes after the death of Antichrist, Christ shall come vnto iudgement:
But the Pope hath raigned these 500. yeares in the Church, vtroque gladio, by both swords,
euen by the protestants owne confession, and yet Christ is not come vnto iudgement: Ergo.
Bellar. lib. 3. de Roman. Pontisi. c.</hi> 9.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. If iust 45. dayes after the death of Antichrist, Christ shall come to iudge the
world, then they which liue at that time shall be able to assigne the verie day of Christs
comming, and so shall be wiser then the Angels, to whom the day and houre of Christs
comming is vnknowne.</p>
                        <p>2. This prophesie of a 1335. dayes concerneth not Antichrist, it was fulfilled in the
death of Antiochus, who miserably ended his dayes 45. dayes after the restitution of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
among the Iewes: see before quest. 26.</p>
                        <p>3. In that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confesseth, that the Pope hath raigned so long with both swords,

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>reatise set forth this last yeare 1608. by <hi>Graserus.</hi> intituled <hi>histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria
Antichristi illius magni,</hi> the historie of that great Antichrist: wherein he taketh
vpon him to infringe and impugne the interpretation of <hi>Iunius</hi> throughout this
booke. This his Censure and animadversion he diuideth into tenne exercises, as he calleth
them: I thinke it not amisse speedily to runne through all of them, and to weigh his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
reasons and obiections, wherein he seemeth to be so confident: whose learned trauaile in
this argument in applying Daniels propheticall visions against Antichrist, as it deserueth
commendation, so yet some of his reasons are not so pithily set downe, but that they may
be revewed and examined.</p>
                  <div n="1" type="exercise">
                     <head>The first exercise perused and examined.</head>
                     <p>In this first part of his treatise <hi>Graserus</hi> taketh vpon him to prooue, that the legges of the
image, c. 2. and the fourth beast described c. 7. cannot signifie the kingdome of the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
which succeeded <hi>Alexander,</hi> as of the Seleucians in the North, and of the Ptolomes,
and <hi>Lagidae</hi> in the South, as <hi>Iunius</hi> doth well interpret: but that by the fourth Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie
of the Romanes is signified, which to this day continueth, diuided into two parts, as the
two legs thereof, the kingdome of the Pope in the West, and of the Turke in the East: and that
not the Monarchie onely of Alexander, but of him and his successors ioyntly is described, by
the bellie and sides of the image, c. 2. and by the third beast, c. 7. His arguments are these.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. The third beast called the leopard, is vnlike vnto the other two before it, the
lion, which signifieth the Chaldean Monarchie, and the beare taken for the Persian state:
But if <hi>Alexander</hi> in his owne person were this <hi>Leopard,</hi> he should not be vnlike the first, for
he was an absolute Monarch, as the Chaldean kings were: whereas the Persian state was not
entire, but consisted partly of the power of the Persians, partly of the Medes, like to the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonian</hi>
state, which standeth in the ioynt authoritie of the <hi>Polonians</hi> and <hi>Lithuanians:</hi> And
beside, not the persons of the kings, but the kingdomes themselues, are here compared to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
P. 37.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The dissimilitude of these beasts consisteth not in the vnlike forme of gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
for the state of the Persian kings was as absolutely Monarchicall, as was the Empire
of the Chaldeans: though their kingdome consisted of diuerse vnited parts, yet that letteth
not the kingly power to be absolutely Monarchicall: but the difference between these king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
was in other qualities, as the one exceeded the other in strength, or in more hard
and cruell gouernement: as is shewed before in the 17. and 18. questions vpon the 7. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
2. not the kingdomes onely, but the kings together with their kingdomes are compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
together: as c. 2. 38. Daniel saith to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, thou art this kingdom of gold:</hi> as his
Monarchie was as gold in respect of them which succeeded, so he was as gold beeing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
also to his successors. So Alexanders person together with his kingdome was this
third beast: as the little horne, cap. 7. ver. 8. signifieth <hi>Antiochus</hi> person with his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. The liues of these beastes were prolonged for a certaine time, and period,
c. 7. 12. But Alexanders kingdome ouer the Macedonians continued but 12. yeares from
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:18834:249"/>
his fathers death: his Monarchie but halfe so long, after he had ouercome the power of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia:
in so short a time what periods, and conuersion of times could be obserued? p. 38.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> That place is not vnderstood of the continuance or periods of those kingdomes,
(and yet this supposall of the fatall periods of kingdomes, is found by experience, to be but
a speculatiue imagination) for the text saith, <hi>the dominion of the beasts they had taken away
before:</hi> the meaning is, that their liues, that is, some remainder and reliques of those beasts
should continue after their dominion and kingdome was ended, and determined: and so
there remained some portion of the Macedonian kingdome euen after Alexander, and of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the former Monarchies, as is further shewed, c. 7. quest. 39.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. The third beast had 4. heads: which are taken by <hi>Iunius</hi> for the fowre chiefe
regiments, which were vnder Alexander, managed by his principall and chiefe captaines: But
those 4. captaines are signified by the fowre hornes, which came not vp, till the great horne,
which signifieth <hi>Alexander,</hi> was broken, for they came vp in stead of that great horne, c. 8.
8. pag. 40.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ. 1. Graserus</hi> here confoundeth the visions of the 7. and 8. chapter: he maketh the
Leopard, c. 7. and the Goat, c. 8. to signifie the same, whereas the <hi>goat</hi> more generally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth
the whole Grecian Monarchie, both vnder Alexander and his successors: as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
by the little horne, which in the vision of the 7. chapter commeth out of the fourth
beast: but in the 8. chapter, both that great horne, which was Alexander, and the 4. hornes
which came vp in the place thereof, and the little horne which came forth out of one of the
fowre hornes, doe all arise out of one and the same beast, namely the goat. 2. these fowre
principalities in the 7. chapter, are 4. heads of that beast, while they managed the affaires of
the kingdome vnder Alexander, and <hi>Arideus</hi> his brother: But after they tooke vpon them to
be kings, they are said to be fowre hornes, which did rise vp in the place of the great horne.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. In the 8. chapter, the goat is interpreted to be the kingdome of <hi>Grecia,</hi> and
the great horne, is the first king thereof, namely <hi>Alexander:</hi> he then maketh not that beast
alone, but the whole kingdome of Grecia is vnderstood, whereof <hi>Alexander</hi> was but the
first king.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> It is granted, that the goat in the 8. chapter, signifieth the whole kingdome of
Grecia, both of Alexander and his successors: but it followeth not, that the third beast, the
Leopard in the 7. chapter, should therefore comprehend likewise both the one and the other,
as is shewed in the answer to the former argument. 2. in the 11. chapter, v. 4. there is an eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
distinction made betweene the kingdome of Alexander and of his successors: for it is
said, <hi>his kingdome shall be broken, and shall be diuided toward the fowre winds, and not to his
posteritie: Graserus</hi> here answereth, that the same kingdome remained still; for that which is
diuided, is not destroyed or dissolued, pag. 43. If this were a good answer, the 4. Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies
described by the image, c. 2. should be all one: for they made all but one generall
bodie set forth by that image, one succeeding another, as the parts and members of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
doe one depend vpon another.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. The 4. beast was vnlike to all the rest, it had yron teeth, it was more fierce and
terrible then the former, but so was not the kingdom of the Seleucians more terrible to the
world, then the three former of the <hi>Chaldeans, Persians, Alexander:</hi> it cannot therefore be
taken for that kingdome, p. 50. And whereas <hi>Iunius</hi> well obserueth, that these beasts are
described respectiuely, as they were toward the people of God, vnto whom the Seleucians
were more cruell, then any of the other Monarchies: <hi>Graserus</hi> would thus remooue this
answer:</p>
                     <p>1. The beasts c. 7. are not more strictly to be taken, then the parts of the image, cap. 2.
but there they are described generally by the defferent qualities of gold, siluer, brasse, yron,
one beeing thus compared to an other. 2. Daniel in particular sheweth, in the description
of the little horne, wherein this beast should be more terrible to the people of God, then
the other: so that in so generall a description it had beene superfluous to insinuate the same.
3. If these visions had specially concerned the people of God, the Prophet would haue pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
his prophesie in the Hebrewe, not in the Chalde tongue, <hi>Graser. p.</hi> 52. 53.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. In the vision of the image, the fowre Monarchies are compared together by
those different qualities of the fowre mettals, yet with relation vnto the people of God: to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
whom the first Monarchie in generall was as gold, the second as siluer, to the rest, see
quest. 45. c. 2. 2. though in particular that little horne were more cruell to the people of
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:18834:249"/>
God, then the other hornes, yet generally also the fourth beast, was more sauage vnto Gods
people, then the precedent Monarchies: therefore in this description there is no superfluous
iteration: and yet it is not denied, but that typically this fourth beast may shadowe forth the
Monarchie of the Romanes: because c. 7. 23. it is said to deuoure the whole earth, and the
Euangelist S. Iohn, Apocal. 13. in the description of the Romane Empire, which is likened
to a beast with 7. heads, and ten hornes, hath reference to this vision.</p>
                     <p>3. This booke is written in Chalde, because when Daniel wrote he was in Chalde, where
these things were shewed and done: and therefore for the more credit of the storie, it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the Chalde. And beside it was requisite that the Chaldeans should vnderstand what
was to befall them in time to come, how their Monarchie should be subuerted for their
pride and oppression, that hereby they might be admonished to be more equall toward the
people of God: see more hereof in the generall obseruations premised, concerning the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse
readings vsed in this booke.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. This fourth beast is set forth to haue yron teeth, <hi>it deuoured, and brake in pei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and stamped the rest vnder the feete:</hi> this description agreeth not vnto the kingdome of
the Seleucians, or Antiochians. 1. for they did not not stampe the rest vnder their feete: they
were rather stamped vpon and troden vnder feete by the Romanes; who triumphed ouer
Antiochus the great, who farre exceeded in power his sonne Antiochus Epiphanes, p. 58.
2. and if this be referred to the violence offred to religion, for the which Antiochus did grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uously
torment diuerse: others did the like before, as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> by setting vp a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
image would haue drawne them from their religion, p. 56. 3. neither did Antiochus so
preuaile against the Iewes: for in the end they resisted him, and restored religion, and setled
the state of the commonwealth, p. 62.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. This their stamping and treading vnder feete, is especially meant of the
oppression of the people of God: although Antiochus also did more hurt and damage vnto
Egypt, then any of his fathers before him, c. 11. v. 24. 2. though <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
his golden image to be worshipped, yet that was but one speciall act in a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
place: he did not cause a generall reuolting from religion, not yet prophaned and pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Sanctuarie, which things Antiochus did. 3. In the end Antiochus tyrannie was stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the valiant resistance of the Macchabees, (as there is no tyrannicall gouernement per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall)
but yet, while he had his time, he did much mischiefe, and tyrannized more cruelly
then euer any had done before.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum. 7. Iunius</hi> interpreteth the 10. hornes of the fourth beast, c. 7. to be the tenne
kings of Syria, among whom two kings of Egypt must be counted, <hi>Ptolome Euergetes,</hi> and
<hi>Ptolome Philopator,</hi> who subdued Syria, and so <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> was the 10. from <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leucus
Nicanor.</hi> Against this interpretation, <hi>Graserus</hi> thus obiecteth: 1. that if these tenne
hornes were tenne kings, whose particular historie is described, c. 11. why should there be
more then 10. kings there spoken of: there are 14. kings of the North and South at the least
there pointed at. 2. there is no reason, if any of the Egyptian kings shoud be numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Seleucians, that the first <hi>Ptolome</hi> the sonne of <hi>Lagus</hi> should be omitted, that
twice subdued Syria, p. 66. 3. <hi>Iunius</hi> himselfe excludeth <hi>Seleucus Nicanor</hi> in that prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
c. 11. 5. <hi>by one of his Princes</hi> vnderstanding <hi>Philopator</hi> the son of <hi>Ptolome Lagi:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the pronoune hath relation vnto <hi>Alexander,</hi> and by <hi>one of his Princes,</hi> is vnderstood <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leucus</hi>
one of <hi>Alexanders</hi> Princes, pag. 68.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. True it is, that the historie of 14. kings is abridged c. 11. 6. of the South, and
8. of the North: but the other are prophesied of for the more euidence of the historie: and
in that prophesie the Angel doth not onely entreate of the tenne hornes of the beast, which
came out of the kingdome of the North, but expoundeth the first vision of the two legges
of the image, shewing how they knocked and beat one vpon an other. 2. <hi>Graserus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
giueth the reason, why <hi>Ptolome Lagi</hi> is not counted among the rulers of Syria, because
he then subdued Syria, <hi>quando Seleucus de eius possessione ne cogitare audebat, &amp;c.</hi> when Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leucus
as yet durst not so much as thinke of possessing that kingdome, p. 69. the kingdome
of the Seleucians then was not yet begunne, when <hi>Ptolome</hi> subdued <hi>Syria,</hi> and therefore
the other two rather are counted in the number of the Syrian hornes and kings then he,
namely <hi>Euergetes</hi> and <hi>Philopator,</hi> who subdued Syria after the Seleucians were confirmed
and setled in their kingdome: and because speciall mention is made of the victorie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
of these two against the kings of the North; of <hi>Euergetes,</hi> c. 11. 8. of <hi>Philopator, v. 11.

3. Iunius</hi> is deceiued, in vnderstanding these words, <hi>one of his Princes,</hi> of <hi>Ptolome Philopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi>
rather then of Seleucus Nicanor: as is further shewed, c. 11. quest. 18. and we confesse
with <hi>Graserus, Iunium interdum dormitare;</hi> that <hi>Iunius</hi> and his followers may sometime be
a sleepe, and be deceiued, p. 70. for no mans iudgement is so perfect, to be followed in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie

and the little horne comming vp among them vnderstood to be Antiochus: 1. These tenne
hornes of the beast must come vp at one time, for how can it be called a tenne horned beast,
if one should come vp after an other? and the little horne is said to come vp among them,
therefore they came vp together. 2. the little horne shall rise vp after the tenne, c. 7. 24. it
was then the eleuenth rather then the tenth. p. 73. 3. The kingdome of the beast endeth
with the destruction of this little horne, c. 7. 11. and then the euerlasting kingdome of
Christ succeedeth: but the kingdome of the Seleucians ended not in <hi>Antiochus:</hi> many of
that line succeeded afterward: and there was almost as many ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. It is not necessarie, that these 10. hornes should come vp all at once, because
the beast is said to haue tenne hornes: like as the beast is described with seuen heads, <hi>Apoc.</hi>
17. which are interpreted to be 7. kings v. 10. and yet were they not altogether, but <hi>fiue
were fallen, one is, and one is to come,</hi> v. 10. this little horne is said to come vp among them,
that is, it was one of them: see more hereof, c. 7. quest. 26. in the ende.</p>
                     <p>2. The little horne is said to come vp after them, that is the last of them: as <hi>Iunius</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slateth,
<hi>post quos exurget postremus, after the which it shall rise vp last, c.</hi> 7. 24. as the word
<hi>acharan,</hi> signifieth both <hi>an other,</hi> and <hi>the last,</hi> so it was the tenth in number, and in some sort
the eleuenth also, as much differing from the rest: see c. 7. 29. 2.</p>
                     <p>3. The beast is said to be slaine, when the little horne was destroyed, not because then
the kingdome of the Seleucians was vtterly extinguished: but the power and glorie thereof
beganne more and more to be abated after <hi>Antiochus,</hi> vntill it was taken from the Seleuci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and giuen to <hi>Tigranes</hi> king of Armenia, and last of all dissolued by the Romanes. This
translating of the kingdome from the house of the Seleucians vnto Tigranes, happened about
80. yeares after Antiochus death: and about 80. yeares after this translating of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
was our Blessed Sauiour borne: see before, c. 7. qu. 38.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum.</hi> 9. And that <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> cannot be the little horne spoken of, <hi>Grase<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
thus argueth: 1. it is called a little horne: but <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> could not be said to
be little, beeing sonne vnto <hi>Antiochus</hi> the great, though he had an elder brother, pag. 76.
2. the shewe of this little horne in the ende was greater, then of his fellowes: but Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus
Epiphanes was not greater then his father called <hi>Antiochus</hi> the great. 3. this little
horne had a mouth, that spake words, <hi>not against the most high,</hi> as the most interpreters
read: but <hi>ex parte al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

<hi>Montanus:</hi> Thus did not <hi>Antiochus:</hi> But it must be referred to him, <hi>qui impietati suae Dei
nomen praetendet,</hi> which shall pretend the name of God in all his impietie, <hi>Graserus</hi> pag. 80.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ. 1. Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> is said to be that little horne, because he was the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
sonne, and so not borne vnto the kingdome, and his elder brother had a sonne <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius:</hi>
so that <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> was an vsurper of the kingdome.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> was not simply greater then his father, but he carried himselfe
more stoutly and proudly against the people of God, then any of his predecessors: and he
also practised against Egypt, and did them more hurt then any of his predecessors: as it is
said, Dan. 11. 24. <hi>he shall doe that (namely to Egypt) which his fathers haue not done, not his
fathers fathers:</hi> these words beeing so manifest, I wonder that <hi>Graserus</hi> so much forgetteth
himselfe thus to write, <hi>constat parentem Antiochum non minores yes contra Egyptum gessisse,</hi>
it is euident that <hi>Antiochus</hi> his father did attempt no lesse matters aganst Egypt.</p>
                     <p>3. That word <hi>letzad,</hi> signifieth not on the part, but rather against the part of the most
high: as <hi>let ziddim</hi> is vsed, Iudg. 2. 3. <hi>thornes against their sides:</hi> and that this is the meaning,
that he shall speake words against the most high, is euident, c. 7. v. 8. where he is said to
haue a <hi>month speaking presumptuous things:</hi> and c. 11. 36. <hi>he shall speake marueilous things
against the most high.</hi>

it: this can not be shewed of <hi>Antiochus: Iunius</hi> vnderstandeth, that he remooued <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopator,</hi>
who had ouercome Antiochus his father: but yet he continued king of Egypt still,
his horne then was not broken: an other of these hornes pulled away, he saith was <hi>Seleucus,</hi>
his elder brother, whose death he procured: but the text saith contrarie, that he entred
peaceably, c. 11. 21. <hi>Demetrius</hi> Seleucus sonne was the third: but neither can it be shewed,
that Antiochus caused him to be killed, neither was he any of the ten hornes, he was not
king before Antiochus: these three hornes then, are rather three kingdomes, which this litle
horne should surprise. p. 84.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Iunius</hi> by a time, two times, and a part, vnderstandeth the tearme of 3. yeares and 10.
daies, during which the profanation of the Sanctuarie continued: But then the spirit of God
had of purpose wrapped vp a manifest historie in obscure tearmes: and the word here vsed
signifieth rather <hi>halfe,</hi> then <hi>a part of time:</hi> this propheticall prediction of a time, two times,
and an halfe, is in the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> applied to signifie the whole time of the persecution of the
Church vnder Antichrist: which is set forth by such obscure tearmes, to the ende that the
time of Christs comming, which should immediatly follow after that tearme ended, be
not knowne. <hi>Graser. p.</hi> 86.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Though <hi>Philopators</hi> horne, that is, gouernment in Egypt, were not pulled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
yet his power and dominion ouer Syria was remooued by <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> and so
his horne there was broken. And although <hi>Antiochus</hi> entred peaceably by flatterie, yet he
might secretly contriue the death of <hi>Seleucus</hi> his elder brother, as he did: &amp; the third horne
plucked vp before him, was not <hi>Demetrius,</hi> but rather Antiochus his father, whome he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
to be slaine in a certaine sedition: see before c. 7. qu. 28. in the ende.</p>
                     <p>2. The time of prophaning the Temple is expressed in prophetical tearmes, as other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies
are, not with affected obscuritie, but to the ende that they might be held in suspense,
vntill they saw the accomplishment thereof: the word <hi>pelag</hi> vsed c. 7. 25. and <hi>chatz,</hi> c. 11. 7.
signifieth, not onely an halfe, but a part of time: see before c. 12. qu. 19. in the end. In the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocalyps</hi>
there is an allusion to this time: but the historicall accomplishment was before the
first comming of Christ.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum.</hi> 11. Whereas <hi>Iunius</hi> vnderstandeth, c. 7. 11. by the slaying of the beast, the death
of Antiochus, by the destruction of his bodie, the extirpation and rooting out of his familie,
and by giuing it to the burning fire, the torments which he endured beeing aliue: <hi>Graserus</hi>
thus obiecteth: 1. That S. <hi>Paul</hi> referreth this to the destruction of Antichrist, which he
setteth forth in three degrees: the reuealing or detecting of that wicked man; the consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of him by the spirit of Christs mouth; and his vtter abolishing with the brightnes of
his comming: and he vnderstandeth not the first comming of Christ in the flesh, as <hi>Iunius,</hi>
but his glorious comming to iudgement, 2. Thess. 2. 8. <hi>Graser. p.</hi> 89.</p>
                     <p>2. Whereas <hi>Iunius</hi> thinketh the little horne described in the vision in the 7. c. and in the
8. c. to be the same: <hi>Graserus</hi> thinketh that the little horne spoken of in the 7. signifieth <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi>
and the little horne in the 8. the Pope. p. 92.</p>
                     <p>3. Whereas <hi>Iunius</hi> thinketh that the historie of this little horne is more fully described
in the end of the 11. ch. these reasons are against it: 1. because no mention is made in the 11.
ch. of the ten hornes, nor of the three hornes taken away before the little horne. 2. nor of the
eyes and mouth of the little horne. 3. and his end is farre diuers: for c. 7. his bodie is destroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and giuen to the burning fire: but in the 11. chap. he is described dying by some fatall
disease, as beeing forsaken of his friends. p. 98.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans. 1. S. Paul</hi> may in the same phrase of speach set forth the destruction of Antichrist,
whereby Daniel describeth the death of Antiochus, and yet not vnderstand the same thing:
As in the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> the Euangelist in the phrase of speech alludeth to diuers visions in Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel
and Daniel, and yet applieth them to a diuers purpose.</p>
                     <p>2. The litle horne spoken of, c. 7. and c. 8. is the same, as may appeare by the description
of it: it is in both places called a little horne, in the 7. it hath a mouth speaking presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
things, v. 8. and in the 8. ch. v. 25. he shall extoll himselfe against the Prince of Princes:
Mahomet and the Pope came too late, to be historically vnderstood by this little horne: for
this little horne must come forth out of one of the foure hornes, which did rise vp in the
place of the great horne (which was <hi>Alexander</hi>) beeing broken: But there was no remainder
of <hi>Alexanders</hi> kingdome long before the rising vp of the Mahometane or Popish sect.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="500" facs="tcp:18834:251"/>
3. It is not necessarie, because the particular historie of the little horne is more at large
followed, c. 11. that therefore there should be a rehearsall of the same things, which were
touched before concerning the same horne, but rather one vision supplieth that, which was
omitted in the other: for to what purpose should the vision be renewed, if the same things
in euery respect should be iterated: The foure Euangelists doe write the same historie of the
doings and sayings of Christ; yet some haue one thing that is not to be found in an other.
And the diuers relation of the ende of Antiochus is no such matter to insist vpon: for the
diuersitie is herein, that chap. 7. the destruction of the beast, that is, of the kingdome of the
<hi>Seleucians,</hi> is set forth, and in the 11. c. the death of Antiochus, as is before shewed at large,
c. 7. qu. 38.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum. 12. Graserus</hi> proceedeth to deliuer and confirme his owne interpretation of
these visions: by the fourth beast he vnderstandeth the Romane Empire, and by the
two legges of the image, the two parts of the Romane Empire, one in the East, the
other in the West, which was extended in length from one to the other 700. Germane
miles: this diuision beganne vnder <hi>Augustus</hi> and <hi>Antonius:</hi> afterward <hi>Constantine</hi> built
new Rome in the East: and these two legges to this day, are the Turke in the East, and the
Pope in the West. p. 99. 100.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> That neither the Romane, nor Turkish Empire is signified by the two legges of
the image, c. 2. nor by the fourth beast, c. 7. is at large shewed before, c. 2. qu. 49. and c. 7. qu.
21. whether I referre the Reader. And further this euident argument there is thereof, that
the toes of the image beeing partly of yron, partly of clay, are saide to mingle themselues
with the seede of men, they shall ioyne in marriage one with an other, but that band shall
not hold: this was euidently performed, when the kings of the North and South, were lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
in marriage together, as <hi>Ptolome Philadelphus</hi> gaue his daughter <hi>Berenice</hi> to <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus
Theos</hi> in marriage, as is prophesied, Dan. 11. 6. see c. 11. qu. 20. 21. and the king of the
North, namely Antiochus Megas, gaue his daughter (to wit) <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> to wife to <hi>Ptolome
Epiphanes, c.</hi> 11. 17. Seeing that the Prophet himselfe expoundeth the vision, shewing, how
and of whome this mingling of seede is to be vnderstood: they wearie themselues in vaine,
that seeke for the accomplishment of this prophesie elswhere, as <hi>Graserus</hi> doth in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie,
where there hath beene such combination of marriages. p. 103. But he can not shew
how the two legges, the kings of the North and South, haue in the Papacie so ioyned and
combined themselues.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 13. 1. By the ten hornes are rather vnderstood ten kingdomes, then kings, as <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,
Macedonia, Asia, Syria, Egyptus, Africa, Hispania, Gallia, Germania, Illyricum.</hi> 2. The litle
horne signifieth <hi>Mahomet,</hi> called litle in respect of his obscure beginning. 3. The 3. hornes
plucked vp before it are the 3. kingdomes of <hi>Syria, Egypt, Africa,</hi> which the Turke inuaded.
4. The mouth speaking proud things, is the new Law of the Turkes <hi>Alcaron</hi> brought in
by Mahomet. p. 109.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. That these visions appertaine not vnto the Romane or Turkish Empire, is
shewed at large, c. 7. quest. 21. whether I desire the Reader to haue recourse: 2. seeing the
10. hornes, and the 3. hornes which were plucked vp before the little horne, are interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Angel to be so many kings, not kingdoms, it is too great boldnesse to vnderstand
them to be kingdomes, not kings. 3. this little horne must come out of the fourth beast or
Monarchie, and haue the power thereof: But Mahomet and the Turke did not spring out of
the Romane Empire, but alwaies did oppose themselues vnto it. 4. though Mahomet had
a mouth speaking presumptuous things, it followeth not, that he was this little horne: for
not one of the properties, but all must agree vnto him, that is signified by this little horne.
5. <hi>Graserus</hi> himselfe conesseth, <hi>spiritum sanctum in hac visione Antiochi historiam tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi>
that the holy spirit doth in this vision handle the storie of Antiochus, but yet so, as that
he maketh him a patterne to describe and proportion our Antichrist by, p. 91. If then this
prophesie were historically fulfilled in Antiochus, it is not properly referred to any other,
but onely typically and by way of analogie, which we doe not denie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum.</hi> 14. These visions shewed vnto Daniel concerne the last times toward the end
of the world, as 1. appeareth by the phrase of speach, which the Prophet vseth: as c. 8. 17.
<hi>in the last time shall be the vision:</hi> v. 19. <hi>I will shew thee, what shall be in the last wrath:</hi> but the
wr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>th which Antiochus shewed against the people of God, was not the last: p. 103. &amp; v. 26.
<hi>it shall be for many daies:</hi> p. 115. and c. 10. 1. <hi>the time appointed is long.</hi> 2. The Prophet <hi>Isai</hi>
                        <pb n="501" facs="tcp:18834:251"/>
speaking of the reiection of the Iewes, and calling of the Gentiles saith, c. 29. 17. <hi>Yet a little
while, and Lebanon shalbe turned into Carmel, &amp;c.</hi> this was aboue 500. years before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of Christ: if the space of 500. yeares be counted but a little time, how then can halfe
that time be counted long, from the time of this prophecie to the destruction of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
by <hi>Antiochus? Graser. p.</hi> 119. 3. The Prophet himselfe maketh euident mention in
these prophesies of the second comming of Christ to iudgement, as c. 2. he speaketh of the
cutting out of the stone without hands, whereby is signified the suddennes of Christs second
comming: and c. 7. of the setting vp of the thrones, and of the comming of the Sonne of
man in the clouds: and c. 12. euident mention is made of the resurrection of the dead. p. 121.
4. The Prophet is bid to seale vp the vision, because it was for many daies, c. 7. 26. as for
the same reason Iohn is bid not to seale vp the words, because the time was at hand, Apoc.
22. 10. p. 122. 5. And that Daniels prophecie concerneth the last times, may be thus ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered:
Apoc. 10. 7. there it is said, <hi>The mysterie of God shall be finished, as he hath declared
to his seruants the Prophets:</hi> of these Prophets Daniel was one, therefore to him was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
this mysterie, concerning the finall destruction of Antichrist. p. 123.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The words, <hi>in the time of the ende</hi> (shall be) <hi>the vision,</hi> are well interpreted by
<hi>Iunius</hi> in the time defined or determined: <hi>legneth ketz,</hi> at the ende of time, signifieth the
same, that <hi>lemoghed ketz, the appointed time of the ende:</hi> so likewise v. 19. the words are,
<hi>what shall be in the last of this wrath,</hi> not in the last wrath: for the word <hi>acharith</hi> is a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiue,
and signifieth the extremitie and end of this wrath; which should be shewed by <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus.</hi>
2. Time is said to be long &amp; short in respect of the subiect, &amp; matter in hand: so that
the same continuance of time may be said to be long in one respect, which is counted short
in an other. The Prophet <hi>Isai</hi> counted but a short time vnto the comming of Christ, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the continuance of the Church of Christ afterward: and so all the time after the first
comming of Christ in the flesh, is but short in comparison of his euerlasting kingdome. This
notwithstanding, this tearme of 300. yeares, from Daniels time vntill <hi>Antiochus,</hi> may be
counted long, in respect of the present state of the Iewes Commonwealth, which was not
to continue long. So the seruant, whose eare was boared through, is saide to serue his
master for euer, Exod. 21. 6. namely vnto the yeare of Iubile, which might take vp the whole
tearme of his life. 3. That neither in this place, c. 2. nor in the other prophesie, c. 7. the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
comming of Christ to iudgement is described: see before at large, c. 2. qu. 55. c. 7. qu.
31. and to what purpose also mention is made of the resurrection of the dead, c. 12. see fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
handled, c. 12. qu. 7. qu. 8. 4. <hi>Iohn</hi> is willed not to seale vp the prophesie, because
part thereof was presently to take effect: but Daniel is bid to seale vp his, because yet 300.
yeares should expire, before the prophesie should take place. 5. The Prophets, which are
there spoken of, might be the Apostles, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> among the rest, to whome the mysterie of
iniquitie was reuealed: and the olde Prophets also prophesied of the last times, which also
was reuealed to Daniel: but hereof it followeth not, that therefore Daniel in these visions
specially prophesieth of the great Antichrist: whome notwithstanding typically we graunt
he describeth vnder this propheticall prediction of <hi>Antiochus.</hi>

the historie of Antichrist is set downe, and not of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> whose acts and doings were
treated of before: and this difference he maketh betweene the prophesie in the 8. chapt. and
this in the 11. chap. that there the Prophet speaketh of Antiochus and Antichrist ioyntly
together: <hi>confuso typo cum eius antitypo,</hi> the type beeing confounded with that which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth
to the type: but here <hi>se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>r sim tractat, &amp;c.</hi> he handleth asunder the historie of both:
p. 107. His arguments are these:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. These generall reasons he enforceth, that this part of the 11. chap. from v.
36. can not be interpreted of <hi>Antiochus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. The Prophet vseth manifest words of digression from the former historie of Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,
<hi>v. 35. that<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>

                     <p>2. The Prophet had absolued all the acts of <hi>Antiochus</hi> before, both against Egypt, and
especially his attempts against the people of God, excepting onely that clause concerning
his death: when then, and at what time should these things be done by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> which
are contained in those ten verses following?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="502" facs="tcp:18834:252"/>
3. There is a manifest difference in the phrase: the Prophet vseth certaine strange words
and tearmes, which doe insinuate some deeper mysterie then of Antiochus. p. 131.</p>
                     <p>4. And if these exploits were done by Antiochus, they must fall out within the compasse
of 2. yeares: which could not be, vnles we wil make an other <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Antiochus.</hi> p. 131</p>
                     <p>5. If all these things were determined in <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and his doings against the Iewes, it
may seeme strange, that the Prophet maketh no mention of the restitution of the Temple
and religion. p. 132.</p>
                     <p>6. And if nothing were intended beside the historie of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> the Prophet would
not haue counted them such great wonders, as he doth, c. 12. 6. p. 132.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The like words of digression were vsed before, v. 27. <hi>chi ghod ketz lamoghed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
yet the ende</hi> (shall be) <hi>at the time appointed: Graserus</hi> would make some difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
this forme of speech vsed, v. 27. and the other, v. 35. but there is none at all, sauing
that in the former the word <hi>ketz</hi> is vsed, which signifieth (<hi>the ende</hi>) which word must be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
in the other.</p>
                     <p>2. The historie of <hi>Antiochus</hi> by his owne confession is not complete and absolued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the 36. verse, because the clause of his death followeth last cf all, v. 45. And these things
expressed in the ten last verses, were done in such order, as is set downe, after he had begunne
to tyrannize and rage against the Church of God.</p>
                     <p>3. It is no maruell, that the phrase is somewhat strange and changed, because he touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
more strange acts and practises of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> then he had done before.</p>
                     <p>4. Neither are <hi>Antiochus</hi> exploits here set downe to be compared with <hi>Alexanders</hi>
acts: for his chiefe attempts were against the pleasant land and Egypt, v. 40. 41. 43. which
might easily be done in the compasse of two yeares.</p>
                     <p>5. This reason as well may exclude <hi>Antiochus</hi> altogether out of this prophecie, as from
the latter part thereof: for it may be as well obiected against the former propheticall narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to v. 36. that no manifest mention is made of the restitution of the Temple, after the
profanation thereof by <hi>Antiochus:</hi> And yet this also is insinuated, both v. 34. where it is
said, <hi>they shall be h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>lpen with a little helpe:</hi> and v. 35. that this persecution should <hi>be vnto the
appointed time:</hi> which was before shewed c. 7. 25. a time, two times, and a part or diuiding
of time: which maketh 3. yeares and 10. daies: for so long the profanation of the Temple
continued.</p>
                     <p>6. Though all this historie be determined in <hi>Antiochus,</hi> yet might it seeme a great
wonder vnto Daniel, that God would suffer such a wicked Tyrant so to preuaile, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file
his Temple in such sort, as it was neuer profaned before.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum. 2. Graserus</hi> further taketh vpon him to prooue, that the 36. v. is not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> but properly of the Romane Pope.</p>
                     <p>1. Hitherto the Prophet hauing spoken of the kings, <hi>Seleucians</hi> and <hi>Ptolomes,</hi> vsed the
distinct tearmes of the kings of the South, and the kings of the North: but here he saith ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely,
<hi>the king shall doe what him list,</hi> without any addition: which name of king agreeth
vnto the Pope, to shew a difference betweene him and Christ, whose kingdome was not of
this world: but the Pope taketh vpon him to be a terrene king, nay to be the king of kings.
p. 144. 145.</p>
                     <p>2. And this clause, <hi>shall do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> what him listeth,</hi> agreeth not to <hi>Antiochus,</hi> who was curbed
by the Romanes, and was circumscribed by <hi>Popilius,</hi> drawing a circle with his rodde, and
made to returne out of Egypt: but it doth most fitly agree vnto the Pope, who doth all
things according to his owne will: he boasteth <hi>omnia se iura in scrinto pectoris habere,</hi> that
he hath all lawes enclosed in his breast. <hi>Graser. p.</hi> 152. 153.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Though in this place, the addition, <hi>king of the North,</hi> be not expressed, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
it is supplied: he is called the king of the North, and the king of Egypt, the king of
the South, v. 40. and though the Pope take vpon him the Ciuill and temporall power, yet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
he nameth himselfe not a king: but he challengeth chiefly to be head in spirituall
matters.</p>
                     <p>2. And though it be most true, that the Pope holdeth himselfe tied to no law, but doth
what he list; yet it followeth not, that euery king that doth what him list, should be here sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified:
for so did also <hi>Caligula</hi> and <hi>Nero,</hi> and other wicked Emperors. Though <hi>Antiochus</hi>
were restrained from Egypt by the Romanes, yet this his vnlimited will he followed
in his owne kingdomes, and specially in Iudea: where he preuailed for a certaine time
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:18834:252"/>
according to his owne vntoward and wicked desire: for he abolished true religion, and
brought in the rites of the heathen, abrogatee the lawes of God, and burnt the bookes of
Scripture, and set vp an abominable idol in the Temple, and so he ruled all according to his
owne will.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. An other note is set forth of Antichrist, <hi>that he shall magnifie himselfe against
all that is called God:</hi> which is most fitly applied to the Popes, who onely by a certaine inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
ambition, haue aspired vnto such degree of pride, <hi>nec divino aut humano iure,</hi> by neither
diuine or humane right: although they pretend, but without all shew of ground, the prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue
of Peter giuen him by Christ, and the donation of <hi>Constantine:</hi> which allegations, if
they were true, both S. Peter might be condemned of great simplicitie, and all the Bishops
of Rome for a 1000. yeares, vntil the time of <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 7. and <hi>Boniface</hi> the 8. who neuer
tooke vpon them this princely prerogatiue. <hi>Graser. p.</hi> 155, 156. But Antiochus succeeded in
the kingdome by descent from his father, and so held the kingdome by right of succession.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. We denie not but that Antiochus was herein an euident type of Antichrist, as
S. <hi>Paul</hi> prophesieth of him, that <hi>he shall exalt himselfe aboue all that is called God,</hi> 2. Thess.
2. 4. but literally this is vnderstood of Antiochus: as is euident by comparing this place
with c. 8. 11. where he which thus extolleth himselfe against <hi>the Prince of the host,</hi> that is,
God, is saide also to take away the daily sacrifice, and to cast downe the Sanctuarie, which
things were so fulfilled and came to passe vnder Antiochus. 2. Though <hi>Antiochus</hi> was
rightly descended of Antiochus the great, and so vnder that title possessed the kingdome;
yet to that height of pride, in exalting himselfe against God, his Temple, sacrifices, and
lawes, and so trampling vnder feete all diuine things, he had no shew neither of diuine nor
humane right: as neither hath that Romane Antichrist. See c. 11. qu. 43.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. Further, <hi>he shall speake maruelous things against the God of gods:</hi> which
most properly fitteth the Romane Antichrist, both in respect of his maruelous and strange
doctrine, which he hath brought in, full of curious questions, and schoole diuinitie: in which
sense he is said to vnderstand darke sentences, c. 8. 23. p. 163. and beside his sophisticate
doctrine, this may be applied also to that counterfeit seruice which he hath brought into
the Church, onely feeding the eye and eare, bewitching the senses, with superstitious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
of images, and such like: p. 165. adde hereunto his sophisticate and cousening mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
p. 166. and the snaring and entangling of mens consciences, with auricular confession,
his penall iniunctions, workes of satisfaction, and such other: All these things most truly are
verified in the Pope: But to <hi>Antiochus</hi> they agree not, who either had no knowledge at all
of this great God, or he spake rather open blasphemie, then maruelous things against him:
p. 167.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. We denie not, but that all these things giuen in instance, are most liuely and
euidently verified in the Pope: but yet this prophesie is rather thus typically accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to him, then literally spoken of him. 2. And this prophesie was verily accomplished in
Antiochus, who in respect of his subtiltie and cunning, his fetches and deuises, in compassing
his purposes, is saide to vnderstand darke sentences: though he had no true knowledge of
God, he might blaspheme him so much the more: for if he had knowne him, he would not
haue blasphemed him: and what els are blasphemies, but wonderfull and strange things vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered:
the same which are here called <hi>niplaoth,</hi> maruelous, wonderfull things, are said to be
<hi>rabhreban,</hi> presumptuous things, c. 7. 8. in a Chalde word. 3. But <hi>Graserus</hi> would haue
that place vnderstood of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> this of the Pope: p. 168. whereas it appeareth, by the
description of the little horne, both c. 7. and 8. and the properties, that in both places the
same enemie is discouered by the Prophet.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. 1. It followeth, <hi>it shall prosper, till the wrath be accomplished, &amp;c.</hi> The long
prosperitie, which here the Prophet speaketh of, better agreeth vnto the Pope of Rome,
then vnto <hi>Antiochus:</hi> he vseth here the word <hi>tzalach,</hi> to prosper, which thrice before is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
in the prophesie, c. 8. 12. 24, 25. In setting downe the prosperous successe of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi>
the Prophet vseth not this word: so that he speaketh of a longer prosperitie then <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
had, which is not seene in <hi>Antiochus.</hi> p. 173. 2. Neither neede this limitation be
added, <hi>the determination is made,</hi> if Antiochus onely were here meant: for his prosperous
successe must needes determine with his life. p. 180. 3. Therefore it is most fitly referred
vnto the perpetuall prosperous successe of the Popes, who for sixe hundred yeares toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
haue so wonderfully preuailed and prospered, that they onely haue not deluded
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:18834:253"/>
the world, to receiue their pretended title of their supreame Vicarship in earth; but haue by
the ayde and helpe of temporall Princes enlarged their kingdome, and triumphed ouer those
that set themselues against them. p. 176. to 178.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. In that this very word of <hi>prospering</hi> is vsed in the former vision, c. 8. where eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
mention is made of taking away the daily sacrifice, and casting downe the Sanctuarie,
it is manifest, that these things were fulfilled, the Iewes Temple and Sanctuarie yet stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
And the reason why <hi>Alexander</hi> is not saide so to prosper, is, because he attempted no
such things against the Iewes, neither so prospered in any deuise against them. 2. Though
<hi>Antiochus</hi> prosperous preuailing in these his enterprises could not exceede the tearme of
his life, yet it was requisite, that the Church of God should be comforted, vnderstanding
that this successe against the Church of God should be but for a time. And indeede this his
prosperitie ceased before his death, at the appointed time: before likewise v. 35. which <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serus</hi>
confesseth to be vnderstood of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> the like phrase is vsed: <hi>there is an appointed
time,</hi> that it neede not seeme strange, the like clause to be added here.</p>

                     <p>Wherein <hi>Graserus</hi> out of the 37. and 38. v. goeth about to prooue, this prophecie literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                        <hi>Argum. 1. He shall not regard the God of his fathers.</hi> 1. This was not true of <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi>
for he set vp the idols of <hi>Iuppiter Olympius,</hi> and <hi>Iuppiter Xenius,</hi> or <hi>Hospitalis,</hi> and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
them to be worshipped, which were the idols of the Grecians. p. 183. 2. But this is
performed by the Pope, for he regardeth not Christ the God, whome the Apostles worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
whose successor he boasteth to be: he is not said to denie or abjure him, but not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
him. <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> malitiously here vnderstandeth <hi>Constantine,</hi> who did for sake the idols
which his fathers adored, when he embraced the Christian faith. But he is said here not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
to reiect the God of his fathers, he onely shall not haue due respect vnto him: And
the Romanists can not wipe away this imputation from the Pope, though he often make
mention of Christ in all his edicts and bulls: he may notwithstanding, and in truth doth, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
regard him: not so much opposing himselfe to his person, as impugning his offices: both
<hi>regall,</hi> in arrogating vnto himselfe power ouer heauen, earth, and hell, p. 185. and <hi>priestly,</hi> in
setting vp an other propitiatorie sacrifice of the Masse, in making other Mediators: his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall,</hi>
in detracting from the authoritie of the Scriptures, making them imperfect, and
adding thereunto traditions, which they are not afraid to call (the word of God vnwritten,)
and the Pope reserueth vnto himselfe power to interpret Scripture, as he list. And thus he
derogateth both from Christs <hi>kingdome, priesthood, prophecie,</hi> and so regardeth not his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
God. p. 186. to 190.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ. 1. Antiochus</hi> did diuersely depart from his fathers Gods. 1. those idols of the
Grecians, were new gods among the Syrians, whom he made to forsake their owne lawes
and rites, to receiue his newe idoles, 1. Macchab. 1. 43. 2. Macchab. 2. 3. 2. he cared not
in effect for the idols of the heathen, otherwise then they were for his profit and advantage:
for he would haue robbed the Temple at <hi>Persepolis,</hi> 2. Macchab. 9. 2. 3. whereas some of
his predecessors had great respect vnto the Temple at Ierusalem, giuing vnto it great gifts,
as namely <hi>Seleucus</hi> and <hi>Antiochus</hi> the great, as it shewed, c. 11. quest. 44. he robbed, spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
defaced, and polluted it.</p>
                     <p>2. All these things are also typically verified in the Romane Antichrist, as further hath
beene declared, c. 11. controu. 21. he many wayes is departed from the faith and doctrine of
the Apostles, and auncient fathers of the Church: and in effect vseth the name of Christ but
for his owne gaine and aduantage: but yet the historicall application of this prophesie belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
vnto Antiochus.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. An other note is, that <hi>he shall not regard the desires of women:</hi> the word <hi>cheme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dath,</hi>
here signifieth the lawfull desire and loue of women, which is in matrimonie: not that
he should vtterly condemne mariage, but not giue it that reuerence, which is due vnto it.
This fitly ageeth vnto the Bishop of Rome, who although he make matrimonie a Sacrament,
yet he holdeth it a profanation of orders, and therefore forbiddeth any of his Clergie to
marrie: And in that the naturall and lawfull desire and affection of women is not regarded, 2
way is giuen vnto vnnaturall lust to that filthie sinne of Sodomitrie, and to other kinds of
vnnaturall concupisence, as of adulterie, fornication, p. 196. 197. 2. But to Antiochus it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:18834:253"/>
be referred, who was married and had children, whom he was carefull of, as appeareth
2. Machab. 9. what though he might be vnkind vnto his wife or wiues, that was not a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of such note, that it should be specially touched in this prophesie. <hi>Graser. p.</hi> 200.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. All this (we graunt typically and analogically) is fitly vrged against that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
of Rome, who alloweth his Clergie rather to commit fornication, then to be lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
married: as hath beene at large declared before, c. 11. controv. 22. 2. But properly An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus
is here decyphered, who beeing an idolater, and so polluted with spirituall fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
was also no doubt an vncleane person of life: and though he were married, yet he
might be, and was carried away with vagrant, wandring, and inordinate lust: see more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
c. 11. quest. 45.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. 1. The next note is, <hi>he shall not care for any God:</hi> which <hi>Graserus</hi> thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth:
that he shall acknowledge no power or maiestie in earth: and this word <hi>eloah</hi> he
vnderstandeth of the Ciuill magistrate, for as before the Prophet shewed, how he should
carrie himselfe in the <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> and <hi>Oeconomical</hi> estate, neither caring for the God of his
fathers, nor for the desire of women: so now it followeth how he should vse the ciuill state;
not regarding them, or giuing them due reuerence: he should not vtterly take away magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracie
or gouernement, but he should make no great reckoning or account thereof: Thus
haue the Popes done, both challenging vnto themselues power to command Emperors, and
kings, to translate the Empire, and accordingly they haue made kings to hold their stirrop,
to lead their horse by the bridle: This great power, <hi>Augustine de Ancona,</hi> who liued vnder
Pope Iohn the 22. ascribeth to the Pope, thus writing, <hi>Papa habet omnem Regalem, Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialem,
&amp; Sacerdotalem potestatem in toto mundo, quia cosecratur quemadmodum sacerdos,
coronatur vt Rex, &amp;c.</hi> the Pope hath all Regall, Imperiall, and Priestly power in the
whole world: for he is consecrated as a Priest, and crowned as a king, &amp;c. 2. But <hi>Antiochus</hi>
was so farre from depressing and despising Magistrates, and the Ciuill power, that one cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of the Romans with a message from Rome terrified him, and made him giue way: yea,
and the Macchabees, beeing of no great power, resisted him. <hi>Graser. p.</hi> 205.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. That the Pope is a despiser of the Ciuill gouernment, and hath despightfully
and disdainfully vsed both Emperours, kings, and Princes, it is euident to all the world,
wherein he doth manifestly detect himselfe to be Antichrist: according to S. <hi>Iudes</hi> descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

Yet hereby is it not euicted, that this is the proper and literall meaning of this place: for
though <hi>elohim</hi> in the plural, be in Scripture applied to Princes and rulers, yet <hi>eloah</hi> in the
singular is seldome found in that sense; but is better interpreted (God.) 3. And so indeede
<hi>Antiochus</hi> cared for no God, but was lift vp in pride beyond the condition of man, as
though he could command the floods, and weigh the mountaines in a balance, 2. Macchab.
2. 9. And yet in the other sense it was also true, that <hi>Antiochus,</hi> though he were kept in
awe by the Romanes, yet he made no account of the gouerners and Elders among the
Iewes: (toward whome the greatest respect is had in this propheticall description of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ)
for he put them to the sword, as common and vile persons: as is touched, 1. Macch. 1.

                     <p>Wherein the idolatrie of this Antichrist is described, as it is set fourth in the 38. v. which

interpreteth, <hi>basilicarum Deum,</hi> the God of Temples: for so before, v. 31. the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arie

Prophet saith, <hi>shall it not be in the day, when I take from them their strength, the ioy of their

                     </p>
                     <p>2. Thus the Romanists haue set vp a newe God, the God of their Temples, which they
consecrate vnto seuerall Saints, as seuerall gods: making vowes vnto a Saint of such or such
a place, and going in pilgrimage vnto them: to this ende they hollow Churches, consecrate
Altars, as tying the diuine worship vnto such places: whereas Christ hath left his worship
free for all places, not limiting it to Ierusalem, or any other place, but euery where God is
worshipped in spirit and truth. <hi>Graser. p.</hi> 317. to 319. And thus they set vp in Christs place
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:18834:254"/>
and stead their Temple gods, and that strange idol of the Masse, which all they say tend vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the honour of Christ: they might as well say that the abhominable idols which <hi>Antiochus</hi>
set vp in the Sanctuarie, tended also vnto the honour of God, p. 239.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>Graserus</hi> after this, entreth to confute <hi>Iunius</hi> translation of this place, who thus rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth:
as <hi>for the God of strength, in his seate he shall honour; be shall honour</hi> (I say) <hi>a God,
whom his fathers knewe not with gold and siluer:</hi> against which interpretation <hi>Graserus</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
these reasons.</p>
                     <p>1. It cannot be shewed in Scripture, where God is called, <hi>eelohe mauzzim,</hi> the God of
strength or munitions, without any other addition, but either <hi>the God of my strength or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge,
or for my refuge,</hi> or the <hi>rocke of my refuge,</hi> and in the Psalmes and deprecations made
vnto God, not in propheticall predictions.</p>
                     <p>2. In the second clause, he translateth <hi>leeloah</hi> God, why then in the first clause should it
be interpreted, <hi>as for the God:</hi> if the the word <hi>cabadh,</hi> to honour, vsually admit not this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
with the preposition <hi>lamed,</hi> it must be considered, that the Prophet speaketh of no
vsuall, but of a strange matter: and yet, as <hi>Graserus</hi> well obserueth out of <hi>Iunius</hi> Grammar,
this preposition is often set before such words, as are gouerned of verbes, which signifie, stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
desire, attributing of any thing, as here in this place.</p>
                     <p>3. The coniunction <hi>van, veleeloah,</hi> sheweth that there the second clause beginneth, and
must be read distinctly from the first.</p>
                     <p>4. If we should not read thus, <hi>and the god Mauzzim shall be honour in his place:</hi> but
thus, <hi>as for the God Mauzzim,</hi> and make a pause there, the sentence should be imperfect.</p>
                     <p>5. The generall consent of interpreters, which take <hi>Mauzzim</hi> here for the name of an i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol:

                     <p>4. <hi>Graserus</hi> also misliketh <hi>Iunius</hi> sense, who applyeth this vnto <hi>Antiochus,</hi> who set vp
the image of <hi>Iuppiter Olympius</hi> in the Temple of God: because (saith <hi>Graserus</hi>) this had
beene no such strange thing for an idolater to magnifie his idols, and to worship them with
siluer and gold, p. 249.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The word <hi>Mauzzim</hi> here rather signifieth holdes and munitions, then tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
as the word is taken, v. 19. <hi>he shall set his face against the fortes of the land:</hi> and so is the
word also taken, v. 31. as is shewed before, c. 11. quest. 39. for it cannot be read thus in
construction, to be ioyned to the former word, <hi>Sanctuarie of strength,</hi> because each word
hath the article <hi>h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        </hi> prefixed, as <hi>Graserus</hi> noteth: nor yet, by way of apposition, the <hi>Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arie</hi>
(that is) <hi>the strength,</hi> as <hi>Graserus</hi> would haue it: for the word <hi>Mahoz</hi> is not taken for
the temple: But in this 31. v. Antiochus assault is described both against the Sanctuarie, and
the munition, that is the citie: so the word <hi>Mahoz</hi> is taken for a rocke or fort, Iud. 6. 26. and
in that place of Ezekiel it also signifieth strength.</p>
                     <p>2. It is most true, that the Romanists haue erected vnto themselues many temple gods,
and typically this prophesie may be applied vnto their Pope, the verie Antichrist, see c. 11.
contr. 24. But this prophesie literally decyphereth Antiochus, as hath beene prooued at
large, c. 11. quest. 43. whether I send the Reader.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>Iunius</hi> interpretation is here refused by <hi>Graserus</hi> vpon verie good ground: so also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
c. 11. quest. 9. vpon these and other reasons it is misliked: though <hi>Iunius</hi> may in some
particular interpretations be deceiued, yet in generall his relation here in this prophesie vnto
Antiochus is not therefore to be reiected.</p>
                     <p>4. It was no verie strange thing, that Antiochus should set vp idolatrie, beeing a profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
idolater: but it was to be wondred at, that he should set vp such an abominable idol in
the Temple of God: that the Lord for the sinne of his people would suffer his owne Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arie
to be defiled.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum. 2. The god whom his fathers knewe not.</hi> 1. This cannot be vnderstood of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus,
for he set vp no such strange god whom his fathers knewe not: if they say this was
<hi>Iuppiter Xenius,</hi> that keepeth hospitalitie and entertaineth strangers, which was set vp in <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizim</hi>
among the Samaritanes, 2. Macchab. 6. 2. neither was this a strange god, though
worshipped of strangers, neither set vp in the Temple of Ierusalem, as this idol must be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
in the place of God: if they will haue it to be <hi>Iuppiter Olympius,</hi> neither was this
god vnknowne to his fathers; for <hi>Seleucus</hi> the founder of the familie of the Seleucians, did
sacrifice vnto Iuppiter at <hi>Pella,</hi> beeing to set forward with Alexander, where <hi>Pausanias</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,

lib. 1. that the wood prepared for the altar came of it owne accord vnto the image of
Iupiter, and burnt of it selfe no fire beeing put vnder, <hi>Graser. p.</hi> 252.</p>
                     <p>2. But this strange god, is indeede that newe deuised and vpstart idoll of the <hi>Masse,</hi>
with the superstitious inuentions of transubstantiation, sacrifice for the quicke and the dead,
purgatorie fire, <hi>indulgences,</hi> and such like: for although the vse of the Lords Supper were
knowne and practised in the Church euen since the Apostles time, yet this idolatrous sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
was not once thought of, p. 254. 255.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. This strange god might verie well be <hi>Iuppiter Olympius,</hi> who though he
might be worshipped by Seleucus a Grecian (though that fabulous report of <hi>Pausanias</hi>
prooue it not) yet the immediate predecessors of this Antiochus beeing kings of Syria, by
all likelihood worshipped the countrey gods and idols of Syria; so that <hi>Iuppiter Olympius</hi>
the idol of the Greekes, might seeme in that behalfe a strange god: and beside it is so called,
because neuer any of his auncestors did offer or attempt to set vp such an idol before in the
holy Temple of God: see before c. 11. quest. 46. in the ende.</p>
                     <p>2. That this prophesie notwithstanding is most fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

vnto the strange idol of the Popish Masse, we doe willingly graunt: as is shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
c. 11. controv. 24.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum.3.</hi> It followeth, <hi>he shall honour this strange God, with gold and siluer, and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
stones.</hi> 1. This is most true that the Romanists doe in most costly manner set forth their
newe breaden god, which they adore in the Masse; As the whore is thus described, Apocal.
17. 14. <hi>arayed in purple, scarlet, with gold, precious stones, and prarles, &amp;c.</hi> 2. But concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Antiochus, he was more readie to spoile the temples of the idols of their treasurie, as
he would haue done at Persepolis, 2. Macchab. 2. 9. then to bestowe any such costly gifts vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them: which if he had done, it had beene no such strange thing for idolaters to be prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
and excessiue in bestowing cost vpon their idols, p. 257. 258.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. It is also confessed that herein Antiochus king of the North, was a true type
of the Romane Northerne Antichrist, who spareth for no cost to set forth and adorne his
newe found idol: as is prooued before c. 11. contr. 25. But still we affirme that Antiochus
is here historically described. 2. Though Antiochus might at some time spoile the Temples
of idols of other nations, it followeth not but that he might be very sumptuous in garnishing
his owne idols: as the Romanes did spoile the temples of other nations, as at Athens, and
other places, to garnish their owne at home: So in like manner, Antiochus that had robbed
and spoiled the Temple at Ierusalem, afterward purposed if he had liued, to haue bestowed
as great gifts vpon it, as he had taken from it, 2. Macchab. 9. 16. his minde then might
change toward his own idols: And though speciall mention be not made in the storie of the
Macchabees, of his honouring this newe idol with gold and siluer, yet so much may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered,
that he spared for no cost, because he commaunded altars to be builded throughout
the cities of Iuda, on euerie side: and before the doores and in the streetes they offred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense,

                     <p>Wherein the 39. verse is interpreted, which <hi>Graserus</hi> also remooueth from Antiochus,
and applieth to the Romane Antichrist by these reasons:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. The first part of the verse he readeth thus: <hi>he shall make the munitions of the
(God) of the Temples, with this strange God: and whom he liketh he shall encrease with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
&amp;c.</hi> this he sheweth practised among the Romanists: for all the strength of the Romane
Church consisteth in the defense of this idol of the Masse; their Churches, Monasteries, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyes,
so many orders of religions are sounded vpon this idol, p. 272, 273. And those whom
he findeth pliable to his purpose, and maintainers of this idol, he aduanceth, he maketh them
Cardinals, Abbots, and such like: So the Pope magnifieth his Clergie, enlargeth and encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
them, in so much that in some countreys beyond the Alpes, the Clergie taketh vp the
third part, in some the halfe part of the whole multitude, p. 280.</p>
                     <p>2. But of Antiochus <hi>Graserus</hi> thinketh this prophesie is not vttered, how he should set
vp his strange god in the fortes and strong places, and fauour those which receiued his idol,
and played the Apostataes, but the faithfull he persecuted: for Antiochus persecution was so
notorious and euident, that if the spirit of God should in such obscure tearmes haue spoken
thereof, <hi>magnam prophetia suae iniuriam facturus fuisset,</hi> he should haue offred great wrong
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:18834:255"/>
to his prophesie, pag. 282.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. We answer here, as before, that typically all this may be well applied to the
Romane prelate and Antichrist, as is also shewed, c. 11. contr. 26. but the historicall appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of this prophesie concerneth Antiochus, who fenced his newe idol with strong holds
and garrisons: as is euident, 1. Macchab. 1. 35. 36. and hath beene further declared, cap. 11.
quest. 47.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Graserus</hi> readeth not right: for he both leaueth the preposition <hi>lamed</hi> vntranslated,
reading, <hi>he shall make munitions,</hi> whereas the word is <hi>lemibtzere, for munitons:</hi> and beside
he addeth (<hi>God) of the temples or basilikes,</hi> which first word (<hi>God</hi>) is not in the originall: he
iustly misliketh <hi>Iunius</hi> translation: <hi>he shall commit the munitions of the God of strength to a
strange God:</hi> that is, shall make his strange idol the protector of Iudea, which is vnderstood
by the munitions of God: for the word <hi>Mauzzim,</hi> as hath been shewed, c. 11. quest. 46. 9.
is not vnderstood of the true God. As <hi>Iunius</hi> fayleth one way, so <hi>Graserus</hi> misseth another
way in his translation: the meaning is this then, <hi>that he shall make for strong holds places of
munition:</hi> So Antiochus caused the tower of Silo to be fortified, and set garrisons there to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy
those which went vp into the Temple, as is before shewed.</p>
                     <p>3. And though Antiochus persecution, were notoriously euident, after it came to passe,
yet it beeing prophetically described, was after the manner of other prophesies to be set
down somewhat obscurely, that both it might be kept from the notice of the prophane sort,
and yet be euident to the faithfull, that would search for the meaning thereof.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. Whereas it followeth in this verse, <hi>he shall cause them to rule ouer many.</hi> 1.
this is euidently fulfilled by the Romane Antichrist, who giueth dominon and authoritie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his followers and fauourites, creating them Cardinals, Prelates, Abbots, making them
Princes, Counties, Barons in their dioceses and seignories. 2. But to Antiochus it cannot
well agree, for he brought not in newe titles of dignities into the commonwealth. And if he
bestowed honours vpon those which fauoured his wicked proceedings, that was no strange
thing: for kings and Princes vsually doe so, <hi>Graser. p.</hi> 286. 287.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. All this is granted, that the Pope of Rome doth wage his pharisaicall clawe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backs,
with great honours and dignities, to maintaine his crowne and supremacie, which is
vpheld with a newe kind of idolatrie: and herein Antichrist is typically described vnder An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus,
as is at large shewed, c. 11. contr. 26. 2. But yet the literall and historicall sense
will direct vs to Antiochus, who gaue honours and dignities, as namely the Priesthoode to
Iason, and Menelaus, which were Apostataes from the faith, and furthered his wicked and
vngodly attempts, 2. Macchab. 4. 3. What though it be vsuall with kings to reward their
fauourites: yet this was a rare thing, and neuer attempted before, that one should by gifts
and rewards peruert the faith of an whole nation, as Antiochus did: see further, c. 11. quest.

yea by his instruments the Spaniards he hath also subdued the Indians and remote
parts of the world vnder his iurisdiction: And it is memorable, that Alexander the 6. draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a line in the terrene globe from pole to pole, made this diuision betweene the <hi>Castilians</hi>
and <hi>Portugals,</hi> that they should possesse all that part of the newe found world, which was

them their prelacies, Cardinalships, Bishoprickes, Abbacies, and other preferments for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money:
as is at large shewed, c. 11. contr. 26.</p>
                     <p>2. Yet notwithstanding this was historically performed by Antiochus, who expelled the
auncient inhabitants of Iudea and Ierusalem out of their possessions, and parted their lands
among strangers, 1. Macchab. 3. 36. the Priesthood also was sold to Iason first, and then to
Menelaus for money, 2. Macchab. 4. see c. 11. quest 47. in the ende.</p>

                     <p>Wherein is expounded the 40. vers. which <hi>Graserus</hi> also contendeth to be vnderstood of
the Romane Antichrist, and not at all of Antiochus, by these reasons:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum. 1. At the ende of the time shall the king of the South push at him, &amp;c.</hi> Whereas
<hi>Iunius</hi> vnderstandeth this literally of the king of Egypt <hi>Philometor,</hi> who withstood An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus
by force, comming to aide his brother <hi>Physcon</hi> against him: <hi>Graserus</hi> thus obiecteth:</p>
                     <p>1. If Daniel here had meant by the kings of the North and South, the kings of Syria and
Egypt, he would haue so expressed them by those names as the other Prophets doe, and not
by so generall tearmes, p. 304.</p>
                     <p>2. This <hi>Iunius</hi> supposeth to haue beene done in the last yeare but one of Antiochus
raigne; but then he wanting money, tooke his iourney into Persia, there to gather tribute,
1. Macchab. 3. 39. how then was he able to furnish himselfe with such great power to goe
against Egypt.</p>
                     <p>3. And seeing he had beene discharged out of Egypt before by the Romanes, <hi>Popilius</hi>
beeing sent vnto him, it is not like that he durst attempt and aduenture to goe into Egypt
againe.</p>
                     <p>4. If Antiochus had lately made such a conquest in Egypt, it is not like when newes was
brought him in Persia, how the Iewes had preuailed against his captaines; that he would haue
taken it so to the heart: he might easily haue recouered that losse, p. 307.</p>
                     <p>5. In the last yeare but one of his raigne, Antiochus went into Persia, which is quite
opposite to Egypt: neither did he send his captaines thither: for he left Lysias with halfe of
his armie to inuade Iudea, neither did he giue him charge concerning Egypt, p. 308.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="510" facs="tcp:18834:256"/>
6. And the king of the North here doth not offer battell to the king of the South, but
onely defendeth himselfe.</p>
                     <p>7. <hi>Iustinus lib.</hi> 34. saith, that after Antiochus was discharged out of Egypt by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,
<hi>reuersum in regnum ibi decessisse, relicto filio impubere,</hi> he returned into his kingdome
and there died, leauing his young sonne behind him: after that discharge then he returned
not into Egypt, p. 309.</p>
                     <p>8. We reade but of two expeditions of <hi>Antiochus</hi> into Egypt, in the second whereof
he was sent out of Egypt by <hi>Popilius</hi> in the Romanes name: he made not a third expedition,
pag. 303.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. As though throughout this 11. chapter, the kings of Syria and Egypt, are
not continually expressed by the names of the king of the North, and the king of the South.</p>
                     <p>2. The iourney which Antiochus tooke into Persia, was after his returne out of Egypt:
from the which though he brought great riches and spoiles, yet his treasure was wasted by
his exceeding liberalitie toward his souldiers, which farre passed other kings, that had beene
before him, for he gaue vnto his souldiers a yeares pay aforehand, 1. Macchab. 4. 28. 30.</p>
                     <p>3. It is not like he would after that discharge by the Romanes, inuade Egypt by way of
hostilitie and conquest: yet as a friend to one of the brethren, to aid him against the wrongs
of his brother, he might although he were discharged, enter into Egypt, or he might not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
this discharge, yet after practise againe against Egypt.</p>
                     <p>4. It was so much the more grieuous to Antiochus, to be foyled of the Iewes, hauing
ouercome the power of Egypt: And Gods hand beeing then vpon Antiochus, he was striken
with such a feare, that he knewe not how to bestirre himselfe: but partly of greife of minde,
and partly tormented by the stroke of Gods hand, he vpon that occasion ended his dayes.</p>
                     <p>5. Neither doe we say, that Antiochus made this conquest of Egypt, at that time, when
he went into Persia: but he had spoiled Egypt before: and therefore he needed not giue any
charge to his captaines concerning Egypt, but onely concerning the Iewes.</p>
                     <p>6. While Antiochus was preparing to come and helpe <hi>Physcon</hi> against <hi>Philometor,</hi> then
<hi>Philometor</hi> hearing thereof did also prouide to resist him: which here is called <hi>pushing at him:</hi>
and then Antiochus came vpon him like a whirlewind: so both may be true, that first
Antiochus made his preparation; but before he gaue the onset, the king of the South first
prouoked him to battell.</p>
                     <p>7. <hi>Iustins</hi> report is in some things imperfect: that <hi>Antiochus</hi> died presently after he was
charged by the Romanes to depart out of Egypt: for after that he went into Persia, 1.
Macchab. 3. 31. <hi>Iustinus</hi> as well may faile also in the rest: that Antiochus returned no more
into Egypt after this discharge by the Romanes: for <hi>Florus</hi> in his epitome of <hi>Liuies</hi> historie,
<hi>lib.</hi> 46. after that <hi>Antiochus</hi> had beene thus discharged by <hi>Popilius</hi> out of Egypt, whereof
he maketh mention in his 45. booke, writeth that the embassadors of the king of <hi>Bythinia</hi>
called <hi>Prusias,</hi> complained of king <hi>Eumenes, eum conspirasse cum Anitocho contra populum
Romanum,</hi> that he had conspired with <hi>Antiochus</hi> against the people of Rome: it seemeth
then, that after this discharge <hi>Antiochus</hi> practised secretly against the Romanes.</p>
                     <p>8. Antiochus made more then two expeditions against Egypt: for euident mention is
made of three before in the 11. chapter, one v. 23. 24. see quest. 33. an other mentioned,
v. 25. see qu. 34. though <hi>Iunius</hi> take this for the first: the third v. 29. see quest. 35. And
that Antiochus made more then two iourneys into Egypt, may be prooued out of the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of the Macchabees: for that was his second voyage into Egypt, when in his returne he
spoiled and robbed the Temple, wicked Menelaus beeing his guide, 2. Macchab. 5. 1. 15.
which is the same voyage mentioned, 1. Macchab. 1. for in his returne there spoken of he
robbed the Temple, v. 23. But this was not his last voiage: for after this he went into Egypt,
when he was countermaunded by <hi>Popilius</hi> the Romane Embassador<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> as it may thus appeare:
Antiochus in this his second returne out of Egypt, brought great spoyles from thence, 1.
Macchab. 1. 20. but when <hi>Popilius</hi> discharged him, he returned against his will, hauing not
that successe which he had before as is expressed, v. 29.</p>
                     <p>And further that Antiochus made more then two voyages, may be collected, v. 29. <hi>it shall
not be as at the first, and as at the last,</hi> that is, in his third attempt, when he was stayed by the
Romanes, he should not haue the like successe, as the two former times: But <hi>Graserus</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
an other sense, <hi>posteriora istius expeditionis non respondebunt initijs,</hi> the ende of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition,
shall not be like the beginning, p. 306. and he would haue it vnderstood of one
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:18834:256"/>
and the same expedition, that whereas at the first, he was likely to haue ouercome all Egypt,
in the ende he was restrained and curbed by the Romanes: so also read <hi>Genevens. the last
shall not be as the first:</hi> to the same purpose <hi>Vatablus:</hi> but the originall standeth thus: <hi>and it
shall not be, as the first, and as the last:</hi> in the other reading both the coniunction <hi>vau,</hi>
should be superfluous, <hi>and as the last,</hi> and the note of similitude <hi>caph,</hi> should be in the
same clause vsed in a double sense: in the first word <hi>carishonah,</hi> it should be taken for <hi>sicut,</hi>
as, and in the latter <hi>caacharonah,</hi> for <hi>sic, so:</hi> whereas in both places it is better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
<hi>as.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But here it will be further doubted, which of Antiochus voyages into Egypt this was
which is here prophesied of v. 40. and in the verses following: for the satisfying of which
doubt, I neither thinke with <hi>Iunius,</hi> that this was his second voyage, the next before that,
when he had his discharge from <hi>Popilius, annotat. 101. in ver.</hi> 29. for such a preposterous
placing of matters historicall is not to be admitted, in so orderly a narration, as the Prophet
hath continued through this 11. chapter: that he should speake of Antiochus third voyage
v. 30. and deferre the second to v. 40. 2. neither doe I thinke that this is a recapitulation
of Antiochus expeditions formerly mentioned: but it much differeth from the former: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the king of the South, here giueth the first occasion: but in all the other attemps the
king of the North was the first agent. And againe here mention is made of other nations,
with whom Antiochus had to doe, as the <hi>Edomites, Moabites, Ammonites,</hi> the <hi>Lybians</hi>
and <hi>Mores.</hi> 3. This then was the last exploit of Antiochus in Egypt, as the 40. v. sheweth,
<hi>in the ende of time.</hi> And though before this he had beene countermaunded by the Romanes
to depart out of Egypt, yet he afterward was had in iealousie to conspire against the
Romanes, as is before shewed out of <hi>Florus,</hi> and so might contrarie to his promise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade
Egypt againe: and the rather because <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of his epitome: see further of this matter, in the 11. chap. quest. 47. toward the

                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum. 2. Graserus</hi> proceedeth and as he excludeth Antiochus out of this prophesie,
so he by the kings of the North and South would haue vnderstood the Pope, whose iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is most in the Northerne parts of the world, and the Turke who ruleth chiefely in the
Sotherne: his reasons for this opinion are these.</p>
                     <p>1. Because there is great affinitie betweene the first kings of the North and South, which
are before spoken of in this chapter, namely the kings of Syria and Egypt, and these kings
of the North and South. 1. as they branched out of the Monarchie of Alexander, so these
two, the Pope and the Turke, are risen out of the Monarchie of the Romanes. 2. as they had
their situation, the king of Syria toward the North, and of Egypt toward the South: so
these two the Pope and Turke haue their chiefe dominion the one in the Northerne parts of
the world, the other in the Sotherne. 3. as both those kings of Syria and Egypt afflicted
the people, yet diuersly: for Antiochus would not suffer the Iewes to enioy their religion,
but put them to grieuous torments: yet the kings of Egypt permitted the Iewes to followe
their owne rites, in so much that they suffered them to build a temple in Egypt like to that
in Ierusalem: So the Christians are tormented and persecuted for their conscience vnder the
Northerne Tyrant, yet vnder the Turke they may haue toleration of their religion, <hi>Graser.

                     <p>2. The phrase also well agreeth to this sense: 1. the word <hi>tzaphon,</hi> which is interpreted the
North, signifieth also <hi>hid,</hi> which fitteth the whore of Babylon, in whose forehead is written,
<hi>a mysterie, &amp;c.</hi> Apoc. 17. 5. p. 310. 2. the king of the South shall <hi>push,</hi> which cannot be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of <hi>Ptolome,</hi> who was of no such force to <hi>push</hi> at Antiochus: but this well agreeth vnto
the house of the <hi>Ottomans,</hi> the great Turks, which haue pushed at these Northern parts of
the world, p. 318. 3. the other word <hi>ijshtagher, he shall come like a whirlwind,</hi> sheweth not an
absolute and entire power, as in the horne to push, but rather a confederacie of vnited forces:
such as the papacie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisteth of in gathering of Councels, sending vp &amp; down of Legats, stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. In that <hi>Graserus</hi> maketh the kings of the South and the North, that is
of Egypt and Syria, types and shadowes of his kings of the North and South the Turke
and Pope in their originall, situation, affection toward the people of God, therein he
graunteth the same, which hath beene so often affirmed, that typically Antichrist is
here shadowed forth, but not literally and historically. 2. neither yet in these things
is there so great affinitie betweene them: for the Turkish dominion did not spring out
of the Romane Empire, as the <hi>Seleucians</hi> and <hi>Ptolomes</hi> had their originall from <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi>
Monarchie, and the Turkish Empire is in the East, not Southward from Rome:
who also are held to haue had their beginning from the Scythians, who are a Northerne
people.</p>
                     <p>2. Concerning the phrase it is not so correspondent nor fitting vnto his kings of the
South and North. 1. seeing throughout the whole chapter hitherto, the kings of the South
and North, are vnderstood to be the kings of Syria and Egypt, there is no reason to take
them otherwise here: especially seeing euident mention is made of Egypt, v. 42. 43. 2. the
king of the North here is described to come vpon the king of the South as a whirlewinde,
and to passe through his land, and to carrie away much siluer and gold: This more fitly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth
vnto the Turke then the Pope: for he hath rather fallen as a whirlewinde vpon Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome:
whereas the Pope hath but pushed at him, and attempted rather then preuailed
against him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. The circumstance also of the time here noted agreeth with the reuelation of the
Romane Antichrist: <hi>at the time appointed</hi> shall Antichrist come, or as <hi>Iunius</hi> translateth,
<hi>about the ende of time</hi> (which <hi>Graserus</hi> misliketh.) 1. This time the Ebionites therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
with <hi>Aben Ezra,</hi> assigne vnto the raigne of Constantine, when he building newe
Rome in the East, left old Rome vnto Sylvester then Bishop of Rome: But this is their vaine
conceit, for Constantine had no such intendment to resigne the citie of Rome vnto the
then Bishop there, which afterward he bequeathed with the Empire of the West vnto
his sonne Constance: neither if Constantine had beene so minded, was Syluester then Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
there capable of so great a gift; the most part of the citie beeing yet Pagans and
Infidels: As for that donation of Constantine, it is found to be but a forged thing, and of
small credit: and it is like, as if one should imagine, that the Duke of Venice should
giue the citie of Venice to the Parish Priest of Saint Markes: <hi>Graser. pag.</hi> 326. to <hi>pag.</hi>
328.</p>
                     <p>2. But thus rather this time appointed may be scanned, that as Antiochus rainged 12.
yeares, though not complete: the sixe first yeares whereof, Antiochus making a way vnto
his tyrannie, yet did not shewe himselfe such an aduersarie to the Church of God, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:
In the last sixe yeares he raged against the people of God, spoiled their Temple,
and made hauocke of the Saints: from which time, namely the sixt yeare of his raigne, which
was in the 143. yeare of the kingdome of the Greekes, the storie of the Macchabees ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
beginning, 1. Macchab. 1. 21. So vnto these 12. yeares of Antiochus raigne, who
herein was a type of Antichrist, doe answer, the 12. ages wherein Antichrist shall raigne:
the first sixe ages doe ende at Gregorie the 7. if we beginne to count in the sixt age af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the birth of Christ: vntill this time, the rest of the Popes, made a way for Antichrist: but
then he shewed himselfe in his colours: when as Gregorie the 7. excluded the Emperour
from intermedling with the election of the Bishop of Rome: and first prohibited the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of Ministers: of this Antichristian practise of this Gregorie the 7. thus complained,
<hi>an.</hi> 170. yeares after, the Archbishop of Salisburge, in the Councell of Ratisbone, as <hi>Auen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus</hi>

                        <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Whereas <hi>Graserus</hi> misliketh <hi>Iunius</hi> translation, <hi>at the ende of time,</hi> whereas he
saith he translateth the same phrase, v. 35. and c. 12. 4. <hi>at the time appointed,</hi> as <hi>Graserus</hi>
would haue it taken here: there is great difference betweene <hi>ghad gheeth ketz, vnto the
time of the ende,</hi> that is, <hi>the appointed time,</hi> which phrase is vsed in the two places giuen in
instance, and these words, <hi>begheth ketz, in the time of the ende:</hi> and v. 35. that phrase is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
by an other word <hi>lamoghed, vnto the time appointed.</hi> If this then were to happen in
the ende of time, it agreeth not with <hi>Graserus</hi> coni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ctures: for <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 7. came not in
the ende of time, there beeing toward 600. yeares passed since: The <hi>Ebionites</hi> fansie, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with some of the Rabbins, we doe with <hi>Graserus</hi> reiect vpon those reasons alleadged,
and other weightie arguments beside, that might be produced.</p>
                     <p>2. In that he maketh <hi>Antiochus</hi> a type and figure of Antichrist, it is as much as we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to be graunted: whence it will follow that <hi>Antiochus</hi> is here vnderstood (which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
denied by <hi>Graserus</hi>) for how els could <hi>Antiochus</hi> typically decypher Antichrist, if he
were not comprehended in this prophesie? But, seeing there is no mention made in this
prophesie of the yeares of <hi>Antiochus</hi> raigne, therein he can be no type of Antichrist. And
for euery yeare to vnderstand an hundred, is not the vse of Scripture: neither doth the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
of the yeares agree with <hi>Graserus</hi> coniecture: for since <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 7. who attained
to the Popedome about <hi>ann.</hi> 1070. or there about, there are expired about 530. yeares: so
that by this reckoning, there should remaine but 70. yeares of Antichrists dominion, which
were too great boldnes for any to affirme.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum. 4. Graserus</hi> proceedeth further thus: 1. this preparation with charrets,
horsemen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and shippes made by the king of the North against the king of the South, he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth,
of the holy warres (as they were called) which were decreed by <hi>Vrbanus</hi>
the 2. in the Councell of Claromont in France, for the recouerie of the holy land a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Saracens, which was tenne yeares after <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 7. which Pope Vrbanus,

because he thereby procured so much woe and trouble vnto Christendome: pag. 334.
335.</p>
                     <p>2. Of <hi>Antiochus</hi> expedition against Egypt and the holy land, this prophesie can not be
vnderstood: for he needed not to haue inuaded Egypt by shippe, which is in the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
with Syria, neither could he by shippe assault Iudea, <hi>ab omni maris imperio separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam,</hi>
beeing separated and diuided from all command by the Sea: pag. 342. 343. whereas
euery part of this propheticall description agreeth with those former warres attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Christians against the Saracens: for they were transported thither in
shippes, and first inuaded Syria, and beeing thence expelled, they praied vpon Egypt:

                        <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Typically we denie not, but that here the warres betweene the Christians
and Saracens may be shadowed forth by some analogie, or allusion: but that is not the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storicall
intendment of this prophesie: for here the king of the North is set forth as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror
ouer the king of the South, comming against him like a whirlewind: But those at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
of the Christian Princes against the Saracens came to small effect: neither did the
Pope himselfe in person goe against the Saracens and Turkes, though those warres were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in hand by his counsell and perswasion.</p>
                     <p>2. Though Egypt were ioyned vnto Syria in one continued continent, yet <hi>Antiochus</hi>
might and did assault the same both by Sea and land: he had his armie vpon the land, and
his nauie vpon the Sea, when he assaulted the two brethren at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> as <hi>Livie</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
<hi>lib. 5. decad.</hi> 5. Neither is it here said, that he by shippes inuaded the pleasant land: but
onely it is set downe thus, v. 41. <hi>he shall enter also into the pleasant land.</hi> Neither is it true,
that Iudea is altogether separated from the Sea, and without the command thereof: for Iaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kob
prophesieth thus of Zebulun, Gen. 49. 13. <hi>Zebulun shall dwell by the Sea side, and shall
be an hauen for shippes, and his border shall be vnto Zidon.</hi>

                     <p>Wherein <hi>Graserus</hi> expoundeth the 41. verse, and taketh vpon him to prooue, that it can
not be vnderstood of the expedition of <hi>Antiochus</hi> against Iudea, but of the attempts of the
Bishop of Rome against the Saracens.</p>

                        <hi>Argum. 1. Graserus</hi> first confuteth their opinion, who thinke all this to be vnderstood
of the king of the South, that he should enter into the land of Palestina, applying it to the
Saracens, who possessed that countrey: But this he well sheweth, can not be so: for the king
of the North is brought in as the principall: the king of the South is mentioned but by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of the other, as it were by an accident: and therefore the storie still runneth vpon the
acts and exploits of the king of the North. p. 148. 149. Then he commeth to examine <hi>Iuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
opinion, that interpreteth all this of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> who in his returne out of Egypt, inuaded
Iudea, but spared the Edomites, Moabites, and the chiefe of the Ammonites, as confederate
with him. His reasons are these:</p>
                     <p>1. If by the pleasant land were here meant the land of Iudea, why is it not described by
that name, in all this whole propheticall vision of Antiochus, wherein so many attempts of
his are described against the Iewes? this therefore sheweth, that by this name giuen vnto
that land, some other thing is signified. 2. And if the Moabites and Edomites be here
meant, who were in such league and amitie with Antiochus, that they ayded him in his
warres, and Iudas Macchabeus was reuenged vpon them, as his enemies: it could not be said
of them, that they escaped out of his hands, which phrase rather presupposeth some former
hostilitie and persecution, out of the which they hardly escaped. 3. And why should he
say the first and chiefe of the Ammonites: if the Edomites and Moabites were wholly spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
who were as in the heart of Syria, why should the first and nearer parts of the Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites
onely escape, whose countrey is extended to Arabia? <hi>Graser. p.</hi> 353. 354.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Iudea is before described by this name of the pleasant land, v. 16. when Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus
the great father to <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> first subdued it: therefore <hi>Iudea</hi> beeing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
expressed by that name, is most likely also to be signified here: the reason, why in the
prophesie of Antiochus expeditions against the people of God, it is described by other
names, as the holy couenant, and Sanctuarie, is, because Antiochus sought more to deface
their religion, then to inuade their land.</p>
                     <p>2. The Edomites and Moabites are said to escape his hand, not as though he attempted
any thing against them, but because their countries lying and bordering vpon <hi>Palestina,</hi>
were in danger also to haue beene smitten and oppressed by him, but that he spared them as
his confederates: so they are saide to escape, in regard of their present danger, in respect of
the nearnes of the place.</p>
                     <p>3. The reason is euident, why onely the first and nearest of the Ammonites doe escape,
because their countrey was more remote from Syria, then Edom and Moab was, extending
to Arabia: and therefore the nearest parts of the Ammonites were most in danger: see be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
c. 11. qu. 48.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. Further <hi>Graserus</hi> would prooue by the phrase and words, that <hi>Antiochus</hi>
inuading of <hi>Iudea</hi> is not here meant.</p>
                     <p>1. By the inuading of the <hi>pleasant land,</hi> such warre is here vnderstood, <hi>in quo de terrae il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
poss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ssione praecipuum certamen fuit,</hi> wherein the chiefest strife was about the possession
of that land: Now Antiochus had that land in subiection before, he now sought onely to
roote out their religion: But this very well agreeth to those holy warres made betweene
the Christians and Saracens, which was for the possession of that countrey.</p>
                     <p>2. Againe, the king of the South and North stroue about this countrey: but Ptolome
letted not Antiochus, neither resisted him in his proceedings against <hi>Iudea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. It is saide that <hi>many shall be ouerthrowne:</hi> which is fitly applied to those bloodie
warres betweene the Christians and Saracens, wherein so much blood was shedde, as <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spergensis</hi>
writeth, <hi>vt in ipsius Templi pavimento is equorum genua attigerit,</hi> that in the paue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Temple, it tooke the horse vp to the knees.</p>
                     <p>4. And whereas the word <hi>rabbath,</hi> many, is put in the feminine gender, here may very
well be vnderstood the word <hi>keholoth,</hi> Churches; because indeede many Churches should
be ruinated and made desolate at the comming of Antichrist. pag. 355. to p. 362.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans. 1. Antiochus</hi> did not onely pollute and defile the Sanctuarie, but he made ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocke
also of the cities and countrey: for his captaines spoiled Ierusalem, set it on fire, cast
downe the houses and the walls, and tooke the women and children captiue, 1. Macchab.
1. 33. 34. Neither were those bloodie and most cruell warres betweene the Christians and
Saracens taken in hand onely vpon a ciuill respect to possesse the countrey of Iudea, but
because they had a superstitious opinion of that countrey, as beeing counted more
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:18834:258"/>
holy then other, at the instigation of the Pope those troublesome warres were vndertaken,
whereupon they were called <hi>the holy warres.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. Neither is it here said, that the king of the North and South stroue about this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
but onely that the king of the North shall inuade it, and enter into it, as before he set
himselfe against the holy couenant, v. 29. 31. which thing <hi>Antiochus</hi> did: in his returne out
of Egypt, he set vpon <hi>Iudea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. Because many did fall in those warres, it followeth not, that they therefore should be
comprehended here: it is not enough for one of the partes of this propheticall description
to agree, but all must be made to accord.</p>
                     <p>4. We neede not seeke for any strange word here to be supplied: the word <hi>eeretz,</hi> earth,
before vsed in the beginning of the verse, is most fit to be vnderstood here: and so the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is, that many nations and lands, sauing those few here excepted of the Moabites, Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,
Ammonites, should feele <hi>Antiochus hand.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. By the Edomites, Moabites, and the chiefe of the Ammonites, <hi>Graserus</hi>
vnderstandeth the Church of the Grecians, Ethiopians, and the Elect, which all escape the
tyrannie of Antichrist: which he would shew in this manner:</p>
                     <p>1. Like as the pleasant land generally betokeneth the Catholike visible Church, which
shall be surprised by Antichrist: so by the other three, which were allied vnto the people of
God the Edomites, which came of Esau the brother of Iaakob, the Moabites and Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,
which issued from Lot Abrahams brothers sonne: by these three are vnderstood three
sorts of people, which haue some affinitie with the Church of God: The Edomites may sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
the Grecians, which came nearest in iudgement of religion vnto the Church of God in
these West parts, as the Edomites were next in affinitie vnto the Israelites.</p>
                     <p>2. The Moabites doe shadow forth the Ethiopians: that as they were also of affinitie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Israel, but somewhat further off, and differed more in religion from the Israelites, then
the Edomites did: so the Ethiopian Christians differ much from the Christianitie of the
Westerne Churches: yet among them there are to be found some seedes and remainder of
the Christian faith: for euen from the Apostles times, they had the Scriptures, as is euident
in the historie of the Eunuch, who did read vpon the Prophet <hi>Isai,</hi> as he sat in his charret:
Act. 8. These two Churches of Grecia, and Ethiopia, the Romane Antichrist hath attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to subdue vnto his iurisdiction, but he hath not preuailed: and so the Edomites and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abites
haue escaped his hand.</p>
                     <p>3. The chiefe of the children of <hi>Ammon,</hi> which signifieth <hi>my people,</hi> are the elect of
God, who also shall escape in the persecution of Antichrist: he shall haue no power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert
them: thus it it is said, Apoc. 18. 4. <hi>Come out of her my people:</hi> and here c. 12. 1. the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
saith, <hi>at that time thy people</hi> (that is, Ammon) <hi>shall escape:</hi> to this purpose <hi>Graser.</hi> from
pag. 365. to pag. 378. this allegoricall interpretation he fathereth vpon <hi>Theodoret.</hi> pag.
377.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. As by Egypt here is vnderstood literally the region, and countrey so called, so
must the rest of the nations here named, of Edom, Moab, Ammon, be so taken likewise: and
seeing that when the Prophet speaketh of the Grecians, he describeth them by the name of
<hi>Iavan,</hi> c. 8. 21. c. 10. 20. who came of <hi>Iapheth;</hi> by the Edomites of Esau, of Isaak, who came
of Sem, the Grecians can not properly be vnderstood.</p>
                     <p>2. And seeing expresse mention is made afterward of the Lybians and Ethiopians, by
them rather the Church of the Ethiopians should be signified, then by the Moabites.</p>
                     <p>3. And as vnfitly by the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> are the elect people of God shadowed forth, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the Ammonites in Scripture are vsually taken to be enemies vnto the people of
God: as Psal. 83. 5. <hi>They haue consulted together in heart, and made a league against thee, &amp;c.
as Gebal, Ammon, Amalek.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. Wherefore, these nations are literally to be taken for the Edomites, Moabites, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monites,
whome Antiochus spared, as beeing aduersaries and enemies vnto the Iewes: and
therefore <hi>Iudas Macchabeus</hi> did fight against them, namely the children in Idumea, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Timotheus</hi> the captaine of the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> 1. Macchab. 5. 3. 6. There we see sensibly
and euidently performed this prophesie: see further hereof before, chap. 11. qu. 48. 4.</p>

                     <p>Wherein <hi>Graserus</hi> laboureth, in the explanation of the 42. and 43. verses, to remooue the
receiued interpretation, which is of <hi>Antiochus</hi> exploits against Egypt and other countries,
and to applie this prophesie vnto the Romane Antichrist, and his attempts against forren
nations.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. As before by the pleasant land he would haue vnderstood generally the
whole visible Church: so by Egypt he insinuateth all those barbarous nations in the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
parts of the world, in <hi>India America,</hi> whether the Romane Antichrist hath also ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
his hand.</p>
                     <p>1. In all the prophesie before concerning Antiochus, the name of Egypt is not vsed, but
it is described by the name of the South: which sheweth that an other kind of Egypt is here
signified.</p>
                     <p>2. Neither is here any mention made of the king of the South: it was then such an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,
as the king of the South did not meddle with: which was not Egypt, for that was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Ptolome</hi> the king of the South.</p>
                     <p>3. If the land of Egypt were here properly signified, then a <hi>tautologie,</hi> or vaine repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the same thing should be admitted, seeing in that sense mention is made of Egypt in
the next verse. p. 382. 383.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Though this land be not in the prophesie concerning Antiochus expressely na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Egypt, it sufficed to be so called once before in this chapter, v. 8. that it may be knowne
in the rest of the prophesie following, what is meant by the king of the South.</p>
                     <p>2. Though here the king of the South be not named, yet Egypt is vnderstood to be his
kingdome by the former parts of this vision: as v. 8. Egypt is expressely mentioned, and then
it followeth v. 9. <hi>the king of the South shall come into his kingdome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. The contrarie followeth, because the same name of Egypt is againe repeated in the
next verse, that it is not to be taken in an other sense, but rather the same word is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
after one and the same manner, where the circumstances of the place otherwise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
not: neither is it therefore a vaine repetition: for the same word is repeated, both by
way of explanation, and for greater <hi>emphasis</hi> sake, that speciall note should be taken of this
surprising <hi>euen</hi> of Egypt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. By the <hi>Libyans</hi> and <hi>Cushites</hi> or <hi>Aethiopians, Graserus</hi> also would haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
the <hi>Americans</hi> in the West, and by the <hi>Cushites</hi> the <hi>Indian</hi> countries in the East.
His coniectures are these:</p>
                     <p>1. The words <hi>Lubbim</hi> and <hi>Cushim</hi> are not here fully expressed with <hi>van,</hi> as els where,
but onely with <hi>kibbutz</hi> in stead of <hi>vau schurech:</hi> which may signifie, that not the <hi>Aethiopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
which inhabited beyond Egypt toward the South eastward, nor the <hi>Lybians,</hi> which
dwelt in the nearer parts of Africa toward Europe, but such nations are rather to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
as came of them: such are the <hi>Indians</hi> and Mores of the West and East <hi>India.</hi> p. 389.</p>
                     <p>2. The phrase here vsed, of extending or <hi>stretching forth the hand,</hi> signifieth, that he
should vnprouoked set vpon these countries, and without any great labour take them, as
by the putting forth of his hand: and beside, the distance of these places is hereby noted,
that he should stretch out his hand vnto them, as beeing not otherwise within his reach, or
vnder his command. p. 391.</p>
                     <p>3. He shall haue power ouer the <hi>treasure of gold and siluer, and ouer all the precious
things of Egypt:</hi> this cannot be vnderstood of Egypt literally: for though their might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of siluer and gold, yet the hauing power ouer the hid treasures, and ouer precious
things, as pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rles; precious stones, so well agreeth not to Egypt: Hereby rather is signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the rich spoyles which the Spainyards, the Bishop of Romes right hand, haue taken from
the poore Indians, and so haue corrupted all Europe with their Indian siluer and gold: And
so <hi>Augustine</hi> speaking of Antichrist saith, <hi>dabit credentibus in se abundantiam auri &amp; argen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,</hi>
he shall giue to such as beleeue in him abundance of siluer and gold, <hi>Graser. p.</hi> 394. 395.</p>
                     <p>4. And this shall be done <hi>successiue &amp; per certos progressus,</hi> successiuely, and by certaine
<hi>pases</hi> as it were, and degrees: so <hi>Graserus</hi> interpreteth the word <hi>bemitzeghadau,</hi> at his foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steppes
or pases. p. 386. But this was not true of Antiochus, whome <hi>Iunius</hi> supposeth to
haue done all this in his last two yeares: nor yet of the Papists Antichrist, who they imagine,
shall raigne but 3. yeares and an halfe. p. 398.</p>

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. It is a slender coniecture, that because <hi>cushim</hi> and <hi>lubbim,</hi> are writen without
<hi>vau shurek,</hi> that thereby are signified such nations as came out of those countreys: for <hi>Zip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorah</hi>

Numb. 12. 1. and yet she was indeede of that countrey, a <hi>Cushite</hi> or <hi>Aethiopisse</hi> of Arabia,
for there was one <hi>Aethiopia</hi> in Asia, which was Arabia, an other in Africa beyond Egypt:
neither can it be shewed, that the East and West Indians had their beginning from the <hi>Lybi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
and <hi>Aethiopians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. The phrase of <hi>stretching out the hand,</hi> hath no such speciall signification, the phrase in
Hebrewe is, <hi>shalach iado, he sent his hand,</hi> which is indifferently vsed, when any are assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
neere or farre off, whether prouoked or not: as Exod. 24. 11. <hi>vpon the nobles of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Israel, lo shalach iado, he layd not his hand.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. Egypt was verie rich in siluer and gold and other precious things: It is said before, v.
8. that the king of the South hauing ouercome the king of the North, should carrie into E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt
precious vessels of siluer and gold: and v. 28. <hi>Antiochus</hi> returned thence with great
substance: this therefore may very well agree vnto Egypt literally, that he shall haue pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
ouer the siluer and gold.</p>
                     <p>4. The word <hi>bemitzeghadau,</hi> properly signifieth in his progresse, or at his footsteppes:
for so the word <hi>tzaghad,</hi> of the same roote is taken for going: Prouerb. 30. 29. the words
then are thus to be read, <hi>the Lybians, and Aethiopans at his footesteps or pases,</hi> that is, shall
followe him: for the distinction <hi>athnah</hi> diuideth the <hi>Lybians</hi> and <hi>Aethiopians</hi> from the first
clause: though <hi>Graserus</hi> thinketh, that it serueth rather for ornament here then distinction,
p. 386. the meaning is, that the <hi>Lybians</hi> and <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> who ioyned vpon Egypt, and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to assist the Egyptians in their warres, as may be gathered, Nahum. 3. 9. should leaue the
king of Egypt, and ioyne with Antiochus, beeing allured by his promises and rewards:
Here then no such successiue proceeding is signified, as <hi>Graserus</hi> supposeth: see c. 11. quest.
48. toward the ende.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum. 3. Graserus</hi> proceedeth to shewe the probabilitie of this his opinion, that by the
Cushites and Lybians are vnderstood here the East and West Indians.</p>
                     <p>1. First the <hi>Americans</hi> are without all question descended of Noah, and most like of
Cham, whose seede was accursed: and those beastly people of the Indians therefore may be
thought to be of his line.</p>
                     <p>2. The coasts of <hi>Africa</hi> are nearest vnto the West Indians, and parts of <hi>America,</hi> and
most like in that behalfe to haue beene stored with people from thence.</p>
                     <p>3. The likenesse of beastly and bruitish manners, and the affinitie in colour betweene the
Indians inhabiting betweene the tropike of Cancer, and the equinoctiall, doe shewe them
to come of the same offspring with the blacke Mores and <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> p. 400. 401.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The contrary is euident out of Scripture, that the East Indians are not descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of Cham, but of Sem: As <hi>Ophir</hi> and <hi>Havilah,</hi> who inhabited the golden Indians, were
the sonnes of <hi>Ioktan,</hi> of <hi>Eber,</hi> and so of <hi>Sem, Gen.</hi> 10. 29. though the <hi>Americanes</hi> and West
<hi>Indians</hi> should deriue their petigree from Cham, yet the other Indians in the East must cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
come of Sem.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>America</hi> is more like to haue beene replenished from the East India, from the which
it is thought either not at all to be deuided by Sea, or by a verie small cut, then from the
coasts of Africa, from whence it is separated by the large and great Ocean: And if the old
inhabitants of America had come from Africa, there would haue beene greater entercourse
betweene them: whereas till of late, those parts haue beene vtterly vnknowne, both to the
Africanes and Europians.</p>
                     <p>3. The similitude of colour is caused by the qualitie and condition of the climate: for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
if their originall from blacke or tawnie Moores were the cause; not onely in that
climate, betweene the tropike of Cancer, and the equinoctiall, but in other climates and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
also the people would retaine the same complexion and colour, if it were naturall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them in respect of their parentage and beginning, and not rather caused by the qualitie
of the climate and region.</p>
                     <p>4. This co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ceit then of <hi>Graserus</hi> in taking these <hi>Lybians</hi> and <hi>Aethiopians</hi> to be the East
and West Indians, hath no probabilitie: and we further reiect it vpon these reasons. 1. The
Lybians and Cushites are here to be vnderstood, according to the phrase of Scripture in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
places: But where they are named elsewhere, they are taken for the people inhabiting
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:18834:260"/>
in the parts of Africa neere vnto Egypt, as Ierem. 46. 9. Nahum. 3. 9. therefore so are they
also to be interpreted here. 2. the king of the North who throughout this whole prophesie
is vnderstood to be the king of Syria, had power ouer these countryes: but the kings of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria
neuer stretched their hand vnto the Indians. 3. the Bishop of Rome cannot be said to
be the king of the North in respect either of the East or West Indians: but he is toward the
East to the one, and Westward to the other. 4. by the king of the North one speciall king
is signified, whose ende is described, v. 45. therefore not a succession of Kings or Popes.</p>

                     <p>

1481. <hi>Geduces</hi> a Bassa of the Turkes inuaded <hi>Calabria,</hi> and made the Pope himselfe <hi>Sixtus</hi>
4. and all Rome afraid: the rumors from the North, was the fame of Luthers preaching, and
of others which set forth the gospel, and discouered the hypocrisie and false doctrine of the
Bishop of Rome, p. 410. 413.</p>
                     <p>2. These reports make him fret and fume, so that he prepareth himselfe to goe forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them: for as Antiochus hearing of the rumors of warres from <hi>Parthia,</hi> and of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of the Macchabees in Iudea, diuided his armie, and left halfe thereof with Lysias to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
the Iewes, and the other halfe he tooke with him into Persia: So the Pope bendeth
his force partly against the Turke in the East, but more against the Protestants in the North
that trouble him, p. 407.</p>
                     <p>3. He goeth forth in great wrath, the word here vsed is <hi>chema,</hi> with <hi>aleph,</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly

                     <p>4. He shall goe forth and destroy many: no speciall enemie is named, but he shall intend
a generall persecution: in which behalfe this prophesie cannot be so fitly applyed vnto Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ochus,

is most fitly applyed to the Romane Antichrist.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. No man can mislike <hi>Graserus</hi> diligence, in setting forth by so liuely demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
the Antichristian proceedings of the Popes of Rome: And it cannot be denied, but
that there is a neere resemblance betweene Antiochus exploits and Antichrists: and this his
application of these rumors is not without great probabilitie: But yet the historicall sense of
this prophesie will direct vs thus rather to vnderstand those rumors, that from the East out
of Parthia and Persia, and then out of the North from Iudea, troubled Antiochus, as hath
beene further shewed, c. 11. quest. 50.</p>
                     <p>2. In that he maketh Antiochus a type of the Romane Antichrist, and specially in the
diuiding of his forces against his two cheife aduersaries the one in the East, the other in the
North, we take no exception to it: We affirme the same, that historically Antiochus is here
described, and typically Antichrist.</p>
                     <p>3. It is vsuall among the Hebrewes to vse indifferently <hi>aleph,</hi> in stead of <hi>he,</hi> and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwise:
as sometime <hi>chemah</hi> with <hi>he</hi> is taken for butter, as Iob. 29. 6. and <hi>chema</hi> with <hi>aleph</hi>
without <hi>he</hi> for wrath, as in this place: <hi>Graserus</hi> collection then vpon this change of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
though it be fitly applyed to his purpose, it is not of such weight as to exclude Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus
out of this prophesie: nay it fitly describeth Antiochus, whose captaine intending
mischiefe, vpon his flattering words, and faire speeches was receiued into the citie, 1. Macc.
1. 31.</p>
                     <p>4. Antiochus likewise in his beastly rage destroyed many: for in 3. dayes space, he put to
the sword 80. thousand, and tooke 40. thousand prisoners, 2. Macchab. 5. 14. So that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he was a type of the great Antichrist, that should shed so much blood.</p>

                     <p>This verse also <hi>Graserus</hi> interpreteth of the Romane Antichrist, and not properly of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. Whereas there is great difference among interpreters concerning the meaning
of this word <hi>apadno:</hi> 1. it cannot be a proper name as the <hi>Septuag.</hi> and vulgar Latine
reade, as appeareth by the affix which is annexed thereunto. 2. Neither is it deriued of the
Chalde word <hi>padan,</hi> as some thinke: for to what purpose should the Prophet writing in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,
vse a Chalde and strange word here? and beside, <hi>padan</hi> in the Chalde, signifieth a yoke
of oxen, in which sense it hath no agreement with this place. 3. <hi>Graserus</hi> therefore taketh
it to be an Hebrewe word, and to be deriued of the roote <hi>aphad,</hi> which signifieth to put on:
and hence commeth the word <hi>eephod,</hi> which was a speciall garment, and ornament of the
Priests: vpon this reason, <hi>Graserus</hi> interpreteth <hi>apadno,</hi> his Clergie, <hi>he shall plant the taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
of his Clergie,</hi> which he applyeth to the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Synode: which is fitly said to be
planted, as a plant, that was set onely but tooke no roote, neither came to any perfection:
for it was scarce finished in the space of 18. yeares: And the intendment of this Synode was
to destroy many, euen to extirpate and roote out all which professed the Gospel.</p>
                     <p>2. Hereof Antiochus made some shewe and shadow, when by his captaines <hi>Lysias, Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lome,
Nicanor, Gorgias,</hi> he pitched his tents in Emmaus with an intent to destroy Iudea, 1.
Mac. 3. 38. 39. But the style of the Prophet aimeth at a greater aduersarie then Antiochus,
which was Antichrist. <hi>Graser. p.</hi> 434. to <hi>p,</hi> 448.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. It beeing admitted, that the word <hi>apadon</hi> is best deriued of <hi>aphad,</hi> which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
to <hi>put on, or close in, or compasse about:</hi> it may as well signifie, a robe of honour, for
so Dauid also had his linen Ephod, as a priestly garment: but it is better translated, a <hi>palace,</hi>
a place of honour and estate: as <hi>Hierome</hi> thinketh it signifieth a throne: see more hereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
c. 11. quest. 49. 3. 2. If this were fulfilled in Antiochus, as he confesseth, we will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
grant further, that typically it may be applyed vnto the Romane Antichrist: so that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus
be not excluded.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. Whereas against this exposition two speciall obiections may be made out
of the text: 1. that these tents are pitched and planted betweene the Seas, as <hi>Trent</hi> is not,
where this Councel was held. 2. and beside vpon the glorious mountaine: <hi>Graserus</hi> fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
this answer:</p>
                     <p>1. That by the Seas, or waters we must vnderstand much people, as it is interpreted, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
17. 15. <hi>the waters vpon the which the woman fitteth, are people and multitudes, &amp;c.</hi>
And this especially is meant of Europe, which is inuironed and distinguished into diuerse
parts by the boughtes and turnings of the Ocean sea, more then any part of the world is.</p>
                     <p>2. And by the glorious mountaine we vnderstand the Church of God, which in regard
of the excellencie thereof, and of the flocking of all nations thereunto, is compared to a
mountaine, as Isay. 2. 2. <hi>the mountaine of the house of the Lord shall be prepared in the toppe
of the mountaines:</hi> this glorious mountaine then is the Church of God, which most flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Europe.</p>
                     <p>3. These two Seas cannot be the Mediterranean, and dead Sea, as <hi>Iunius:</hi> for both the
Prophet should haue spoken darkely and obscurely, of an euident matter: and beside the
lake <hi>Asphaltes,</hi> called the dead Sea, compared with the Mediterranean, is not worthie the
name of a Sea, <hi>p.</hi> 448. to <hi>p.</hi> 459.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. There is great difference to say betweene the Seas, and vpon the Seas or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
here he pitcheth his tent and palace, not vpon them, but betweene them: and seeing
here there is euident description of a place, the words are to be taken literally, not in allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall
sense: as Nahum, 3. 9. <hi>art thou better then No, full of people, which lay vpon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
whose ditch was the Sea, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. True it is, that the Church of God is in diuerse prophesies resembled to a mountaine,
by allusion vnto the mountaine, whereupon the Temple was built: but to appropriate this
to any particular place, as namely to the citie of Trent in that sense is not safe: for so the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of the true Church of Christ, should be giuen to that Antichristian assemblie: This may
more fitly be applied vnto that Laterane Councel vnder <hi>Leo</hi> the 10. which was held at
Rome, which is situate indeede betweene two Seas. <hi>Tyrrhenum</hi> and <hi>Adriaticum.</hi>
                     </p>

3. If the Prophet had in direct tearmes expressed the Seas by their names, it had beene
an historie, rather then a prophesie: and it is euident, that in Scripture that salt lake is called
by the name of the Sea, as Numb. 34. v. 6. the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> is called the great Sea, and
the other the salt Sea, v. 3. wherefore seeing we can find this prophesie to haue beene lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
and historically fulfilled, when Antiochus captaines pitched in Em<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the mountaines; as hath beene shewed at large, cap. 11. quest. 50. it is in vaine to

                           </gap>, and none shall helpe him:
Graserus</hi> proceedeth to applie vnto the Romane Antichrist, and sheweth the fatall end of his
Antichristian kingdome to be at hand: which 1. he doth gather by two arguments: the
great insolencie of the Papall Sea, for pride goeth before a fall: and the most desperate means
which the Romanists vse to maintaine their kingdome: their sophisticate doctrine, and their
perfidious and treacherous practises: which beeing the chiefe meanes, which are left vnto
them, it is euident that their disease is dangerous and deadly, the meanes beeing so desperate,
pag. 462.</p>
                     <p>2. And further it is said, <hi>none shall helpe him:</hi> herein Antiochus in his miserable end was a
type of the ruine of Antichrist, who was striken with such a loathsome disease, that his own
friends did forsake him, and could minister no helpe vnto him: Such was the fal of Babylon,

to be Mahomets companion, and to haue receiued power of him, to conferre Paradise vpon

               <p>Concerning the controversie of Christs encreasing in the graces of the spirit, thus much
further may be added by way of explanation. 1. Out of <hi>Cyril,</hi> that <hi>corporale augmentum,
&amp;c.</hi> the growth of bodie, and encreasing in wisedome, <hi>humanitatis mensurae conueniat,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geeth
vnto his humane condition: as Christ was God he encreased not. 2. In respect of his
hypo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>aticall vnion, there was no encrease: he was in the verie first instant of his conception
perfect God and perfect man, as Heb. 1. 6. <hi>when he bringeth in his first begotten Sonne into the
world, he saith, let all the Angels of God worship him:</hi> diuine worship was due vnto Christ, at
his verie first comming into the world. 3. Concerning the graces which the diuine nature
conferred vpon his humanitie, they were either <hi>habituall,</hi> infused into the soule of our Sauiour
in the verie first vnion, or <hi>experimentall:</hi> the first encreased not, but were as ample and full in
the first instant of this blessed vnion, as afterward (for Christs soule came not into his bodie
as <hi>tabula abrasa,</hi> a bare and naked table wherein nothing is written, as our soules are,) sauing
that these infused and habituall graces could not shewe themselues, till the organicall bodie
was made fit thereunto, as at 12. yeares he disputed and apposed the Doctors: these graces
encreased onely <hi>per modum declarationis,</hi> by way of declaration, as <hi>Cyril</hi> saith, <hi>voluit quasi
paulatim diuinitatis suae gloriam declarare,</hi> he would by little and little manifest the glorie of
his dietie. 4. Yet the experimentall knowledge, which is gathered by sense and experience,
encreased in Christ, as <hi>Ambrose</hi> well determineth, <hi>sapientia sensu proficit, quia à sensu sapien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,
sensus igitur proficiebat humanus,</hi> wisedome encreaseth by sense, for wisedome commeth
by the sense: his humane sense encreased, &amp;c. and consequently his experimentall wisedome
and knowledge: and that there was an accession of his experimentall knowledge, the Apostle
sheweth, Heb. 2. 18. <hi>in that he suffred and was tempted, he is able to succour them that are
tempted.</hi>
