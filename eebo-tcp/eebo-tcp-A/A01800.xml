         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and the Prophet for the peace of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> ſo
we for the peace of <hi>London.</hi> As for the Romiſh Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,
the ſuperſtitious Papiſts, who reioyce at this
ours and your preſent calamitie, inſulting ouer vs in
this land, and in others, preaching it vnto theirs pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely,
and muttering it priuately, that this deluge of
the plague is iuſtly broken through among vs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we haue (as they ſpeake) forſaken the religion

               <pb facs="tcp:21216:3"/>
Since wee left off to burne incenſe to the Queene of
heauen, we haue had ſcarceneſſe of things, and haue
beene conſumed by the ſword and famine. Were not
alſo the good Chriſtians in the time of <hi>Tertullian, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,
Arnobius,</hi> and others, in this manner vpbrayed
by the Heathens, who imputed to them the cauſe of
Peſtilence, Warre, Invndations, Earthquakes, and
other troubles? But O yee blind ſonnes of men, what
was the cauſe of the flood in the time of <hi>Noah?</hi> was it
the Religion of that time, or was it <hi>Noah</hi> the preacher
of righteouſneſſe? The Lord himſelfe ſheweth the
cauſe, <hi>Gene. 6. and 7. Chap.</hi> the ſinnes of that age, and
the flood of iniquitie. For which like ſinnes, both we,
and their profeſſors alſo, as well as we at diuers times
haue felt this rod, and alſo at this preſent time in Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
they doo taſte of this ſmart-whip: which giueth
vs iuſt occaſion to ſpeake vnto them that of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,<note place="margin">Iere. p 18.</note>
               <hi>Thine inuentions haue procured thee theſe things.</hi>
Remember O Lord the children of Edom (theſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious
Romaniſts) which ſpeake,<note place="margin">Pſal 137. 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8.</note> raſe it, raſe it to

to the head of the race, where I firſt began, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
to you my brethren with ſighes, to whome, I
may vſe the Apoſtles words,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 2, 4.</note> 
               <hi>In anguiſh of heart I write
vnto you with many teares.</hi> Of Prayer, of which this
treatiſe following doeth intreate: I may ſpeake that
which <hi>Martha</hi> ſaid vnto Chriſt, <hi>If thou hadſt beene here,
my brother ſhould not haue died.</hi> So likewiſe, if feruent
and humble prayer had beene amongſt vs, we ſhould
not haue ſuffered theſe things. But ſeeing wee are in
the flood, and that the waters are entred euen to our
<pb facs="tcp:21216:4"/>
ſoules, <hi>Pſal. 69. 1.</hi> Therefore behold, againſt this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge
I ſend to you a delineation of the true Arke of
<hi>Noah,</hi> whereunto yee and we ought to flie to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued,
which is the name of <hi>Iehouah, Prou. 18. 10.</hi> the
little <hi>Zoar,</hi> and the Sanctuarie to hide and ſafegard
our ſelues.</p>
            <p>Two things beloued, may put you in minde this
yeere of two things. Firſt, of <hi>Noah:</hi> Secondly, of <hi>Ionas</hi>
withered Gourd, vnto which your preſent calamitie
for diuers reſpects fitly may be compared.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt is, your great ioyes, preparations and
ſtately buildings in the beginning of the yeere, like
vnto the ioy, feaſting, marrying, and building of thoſe
who liued in the dayes of <hi>Noah, Matth. 24. Luke 17.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond is, the ſuddaine alteration which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
thereupon, like vnto the vnexpected flood and
deluge which came vpon the ſecuritie of the olde
world. We liued before as in the dayes of <hi>Noah,</hi> wee
are now as it were in the flood (the afflictions and
troubles of the ſonnes of men being not vnfitly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
vnto waters by the Kingly Prophet <hi>Dauid)</hi>
which prayer at this time London thou mayeſt make,
<hi>Saue me O God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 69. 1.</note> 
               <hi>for the waters are entred euen to my ſoule.</hi>
Seeing therefore, that thou with <hi>Ionas</hi> mayeſt ſay,
Lord, the floods compaſſe me about, what remaineth
but that we enter into the Arke to be preſerued? Giue
me leaue beloued, by a compariſon to ſhew you two
things, the flood wherewith ye are compaſſed about,
and the Arke which yee ought to enter.</p>
            <p>In the flood of <hi>Noah</hi> the holy Ghoſt noteth foure
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> things; Firſt, the cauſe for which it was ſent. Secondly
the time when it began. Thirdly, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance of it.
<pb facs="tcp:21216:4"/>
Fourthly, his decreaſing. The cauſe of which, was
the ſinne of that age, which was growen vp as a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
tree, producing diuers ſower and deadly fruites.
The firſt was, the great ſecuritie of the ſonnes of God,
that is of thoſe which made profeſſion of the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
eating and drinking, marrying and building,
<hi>Luke 17. 27.</hi> The ſecond, their diſobedience and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning
of <hi>Noah,</hi> the Preacher of righteouſneſſe, and
of the long ſuffering of God,<note place="margin">Gene. 6. 1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>1. Pet. 3. 20.</hi> The third,
their fornications, and vngodly alliances with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels,
and with that damnable race of <hi>Cain,</hi> without
reſpect either of family or Religion. The fourth, their
crueltie and oppreſſion of their neighbours, <hi>Gene. 6.
11.</hi> and 13. Laſtly, the corruption of their wayes, <hi>Gen.
6. 12.</hi> and becauſe their wickedneſſe was great vpon
the earth. <hi>2. Sam.</hi> This is alſo the cauſe (to applie the
firſt to our ſelues) which hath mooued the Lord to
ſend this deluge of the Plague into the land, becauſe
the ſelfe ſame ſinnes did raigne among vs: and as it
was in the dayes of <hi>Noah,</hi> ſo hath it beene in theſe
laſt dayes of the ſonne of man:<note place="margin">Luke 27. 26.</note> and therefore ſeeing
a flood of iniquitie hath ouerwhelmed vs, hath not
this flood of the Plague iuſtly and ſuddenly ouerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
vs?</p>
            <p>From the firſt let me leade you to the ſecond, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
circumſtance of the time, when the flood began, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the <hi>7. Chap. of Gene. ver. 11.</hi> In the ſecond mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
the ſeuenteenth day of the moneth, which was
about the beginning of May, or as others ſay in April,
when all things did moſt flouriſh, and when it was
leſſe expected, which ſuddenneſſe hath changed their
ioy into ſorow. So likewiſe, to applie the ſecond to vs,
<pb facs="tcp:21216:5"/>
this deluge of the Plague began to encreaſe about the
beginning of May (as I haue noted) when all things
did flouriſh in the Countrey, and in the Citie, when
we were merrie as the ſonnes of the old world, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying,
feaſting, building, and erecting our armes tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vmphants,
when we leſſe expected it, which hath tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
alſo our ioy into ſorrow.</p>
            <p>And as <hi>Noahs</hi> flood cauſed them to flie vpon high
mountaines and trees that the waters ſhould not
reach vnto them: So this deluge hath it not cauſed
thouſands to depart into the Countrey farre and
neere to be preſerued?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> From the ſecond I come to the third, the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the flood, noted <hi>Gen. 7. 24. The waters couered,
and preuailed vpon the earth an hundreth and fiftie dayes</hi>
(which is about halfe a yeere) and then, in the end of
an hundreth and fiftie dayes the waters abated, <hi>Gene.
8. 3.</hi> which was in Nouember, reckning from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of them. To applie the third, our deluge
hath not yet preuailed an hundreth and fiftie dayes,
and I hope through the mercie of God, that it wil not
ſo long encreaſe and bee in his full ſtrength and force,
(and yet O Lord, by the great flood of our iniquitie
we haue deſerued a longer encreaſing, <hi>But haue mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
vpon vs O Lord according to the multitude of thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsions,
Pſal. 51. 1.)</hi> Let mee applie the fourth thing,
which is the decreaſing of <hi>Noahs</hi> flood, noted <hi>Gen. 8. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
and they decreaſed vntil the tenth moneth (which
was the moneth of December) this decreaſing begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
from Nouember, after the hundreth and fiftie
dayes. Our flood the Lord bee thanked, hath begun
reaſonably to decreaſe in the moneth of September,
<pb facs="tcp:21216:5"/>
and the Lord graunt that theſe waters from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward
may not bee going and comming, but that
they may altogether decreaſe vntill the tenth month.
And as the tops of the mountaines which were coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
becauſe of the flood, were ſeene in the tenth
moneth, <hi>Gene. 8. 5.</hi> which was in December: So the
Lord graunt, that the heads of the Citie, the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
and principall Citizens, which becauſe of
this deluge haue beene couered, may be ſeene againe
in the Citie, the tenth moneth. Further, as on the
firſt day of the firſt moneth, <hi>Gene. 8. 13.</hi> the vpper part
of the ground was wholly drie, which was in March
and part of Aprill. So the Lord graunt that this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge
may in that moneth wholly bee dried vp, and
that there remaine not any reliques therof: if it pleaſe
him to remember vs in his mercie as hee did <hi>Noah,
Gene. 8. 1.</hi> Now that he may remember vs in his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
let vs forſake the ſinnes of the olde world, let the
flood of iniquitie which is broken through among vs
decreaſe, and wholly be dried vp. Great hath beene,
and extraordinarie (I doo confeſſe) the invndation
of the Plague this preſent yeere, and therefore let our
repentance bee great and extraordinarie. It is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of many of the Aegyptians by <hi>Sozom, lib. 7. cap. 20.</hi>
that being terrified by the ſtrange invndation of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,
higher then the wonted maner thereof was, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
they condemned their ancient Idolatry, and
applied themſelues to the worſhip of the liuing God:
So likewiſe, ſeeing that this deluge of the Plague hath
beene higher then the wonted maner, as the weekly
Bils doo ſhewe vnto vs, let vs bee terrified, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue
our ancient iniquities, let vs applie our ſelues
<pb facs="tcp:21216:6"/>
to humble and feruent prayer, a principall part of the
worſhip of God. And as the Arke in the flood reſted
vpon the high mountaines of Ararat, <hi>Gene. 8. 4.</hi> So
let vs in this flood reſt vpon the Lord, and vpon the
holy mountaine of Heauen; the power and mercie of
our God, are the mountaines whereupon the Arke
may finde reſt; thoſe are the holy hils whereon Sion
hath her euerlaſting foundation.</p>
            <p>Hauing ſhewed to you the flood, I come to the
Arke. The holy Ghoſt in the deſcription of the Arke

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> As for the Arke, into which wee muſt enter, it is
not an Arke made of corruptible wood, nor an Arke
heere beneath ſloating and toſſing in the ſea of this

a flouriſhing Gourd, and as a greene Laurell

haue we reioyced exceedingly for this our proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
witneſſe our feaſtes, our braueries, preparations,

And therefore as the Gourd of <hi>Ionas</hi> ſuddenly withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and his exceeding ioy was changed into ſorrow:
ſo our ioyfull ſongs haue beene changed into lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,<note place="margin">Lam. 1. 16.</note>
and our pleaſure hath beene quite daſht; the
Lord hath made vs to ſay with <hi>Ieremie, For theſe things

how doth the Citie remaine ſolitarie that was
full of people, ſhee is a widow, ſhee that was great
among the nations, her Prieſts ſigh, her virgins are

hereunto I may adde that in the fifth verſe, it is for
the multitude of her tranſgreſſions, for which her
people is now in diuers places ſcattered, liuing as it
were in exile and baniſhment, and ſighing (as the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites

<pb facs="tcp:21216:8"/>
hath taken away, and hee that had power ouer the

<hi>Apoc. 6.</hi> As <hi>Ionas</hi> little thought of ſo ſpeedie an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
ſo did we little expect ſuch a ſudden change; but
it was feared and alſo prophecied of many (as I my

<hi>Nullum violentem perpetuum.</hi> Some haue died

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The time when the Gourd withered, was when
the morning, or the Sunne did ariſe, in the comming

had beene as it were laide downe in the bed of

whoſe beames were comfortable to the whole land
(and the Lord graunt that he may long ſhine ouer

the Citie, and all her inhabitants, then the
Gourd withered, and the worme of Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
came. And as Chriſt wept ouer Ieruſalem in

<hi>Bleſſed is the King that commeth in the name of the Lord,</hi>

               <hi>when the multitudes did reioyce, and ſpred their cloathes in

            <p>The meanes or the inſtrument (which is the fifth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
thing to bee conſidered) which the Lord vſed to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
<hi>Ionas,</hi> and which hee ſent as a meſſenger from
heauen, to ſmite the Gourd, was firſt (a worme)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
ſecondly, the wind and the Sunne. The worme, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

and yet giueth a mortall blow, he that could haue
ſent a great wind to turne it vpſide-downe, a light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

<pb facs="tcp:21216:9"/>
ſendeth but one little contemptible worme to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
that buſineſſe: So the Lord to beate downe the
pride and immoderate ioy of our Citie, the flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Gourd of our proſperitie, hath not ſent whole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
deuouring beaſts, Earthquakes, fire or brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
from heauen, he ſendeth only a peſtilence, litle
Carbuncles, ſpots, and tokens in our fleſh, which
ſeeme to bee nothing, or to haue no force, and yet
ſuddainely they beate downe the proudeſt and the
ſtrongeſt. Iſt not ſtrange that a little botch or carbun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
hath ſuch admirable force? Well may they be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Gods tokens, for thereby he ſheweth his ſtrength.
Let this ſerue on the one ſide, to make vs to ſtand in
awe of the mightie power of God, and on the other
ſide, adoring this his power, to humble our ſelues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Maieſtie; for how dareſt thou O ſonne of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
lift vp thy ſelfe againſt that Lord, who can caſt
thee downe with a little carbuncle? Let not the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures

couert of them; let vs not ſay, we ſhal neuer be moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
for they are but Gourds, and the Lord hath a
worme of iudgement. And what is the freedom from
the rod of God, our dauncing to the Tabert &amp; Harpe,
but a Gourd for a time? I call to witneſſe young men,

<pb facs="tcp:21216:9"/>
The worme then which the Lord had prepared for

teacheth, the Peſtilence, the King of heauens
Purſiphant; and therefore wee may crie with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,

inſtrument which the Lord vſed, was the wind

the other members receiue their maintenance, which

which hath arreſted ſome in the Countrey, as the experience

as the ſecond place adioyning vnto the firſt doth witneſſe.
Of this place then, which is the right Arke, and the little

Chriſtian Readers to diſcourſe out of the harmonie of theſe
two places here prefixed.</p>
            <p>To pray well ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> is an excellent art, which
doth adorne a Chriſtian, but it is not ſufficient to know that
we muſt pray, but alſo in what manner: and therefore that we
might the better be inſtructed in the going to this place, and
become skilfull in this art, I will braunch the deſcription of
this place into theſe three ſeuerall parts, which will ſtore vs
with a cluſter of ſingular meditations.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, the name of the place, it is (the name of the
Lord.) The ſecond is, the qualitie, condition, propertie, and
the ſafeneſſe of it, expreſſed in two things: Firſt, becauſe it is
<pb facs="tcp:21216:12"/>
               <hi>(a ſtrong towre):</hi> ſecondly, by the ſucceſſe of thoſe that runne
vnto it (and is <hi>exalted)</hi> or deliuered: which is the thing which
they receiue that run to it.</p>
            <p>The third thing is, what maner of perſons they muſt be
that flie to it, and what houſehould ſtuffe they muſt carrie thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with them to be receiued, noted in theſe words (the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> things. For as in the time of plague, for our departure, firſt it
is neceſſarie, that we know the name of the place whereunto
we go: ſecondly, that we haue feet to beare &amp; carie vs thither:
thirdly, that we haue a directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that we might not erre: fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that wee haue ſome right &amp; intereſt there, or ſome acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
that we may be receiued. So likewiſe theſe foure things
are neceſſarie to be knowne of vs, in our ſpirituall departure.</p>
            <p>Touching the name of the place whereunto <hi>Dauid</hi> fled in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
the time of plague,<note place="margin">The name of the place.</note> as it hath diuers names, ſo in this place it is
called the name of <hi>Iehouah.</hi> Heere I pertermit the fiue ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ſignifications of the name of the Lord vſed in the book of
God, taking it in this place, firſt for the Lord himſelf: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for his attributes by which hee doth manifeſt himſelfe. Of
which <hi>Moſes, Num 14.</hi> bringeth in a perfect catalogue: &amp; the
Lord hath deliuered this his name by proclamation, <hi>Exo. 34.
5. 6.</hi> The Lord, the Lord, ſtrong, merciful, &amp; gratious, ſlow to
anger, &amp; aboundant in goodnes and truth, &amp;c. God then the
almightie, eternall, immortall inuiſible Lord, the iudge of the
world, <hi>Pſal 94. 2.</hi> God, merciful &amp; gratious, the ſupreme phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition

God to whom power belongeth, and whoſe is ſaluation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
<hi>Pſal. 62.</hi> is the place it ſelfe whereunto <hi>Dauid,</hi> and wee
ought to flie from the contagion. The name of a place if it be
known, famous and renowned, hath often much force to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
vs rather to goe vnto ſuch a place, then vnto ſuch or
ſuch: ſurely there was neuer name of place more worthy to
goe vnto, then the name of <hi>Iehouah.</hi> O ye righteous ſoules
that thirſt by reaſon of the heate of the plague vpon your
beddes, flie vnto this place, to the waters of comfort: here are
wels enough to be drawne at: this is the name which God
hath proclaimed to the world, and whereby he would be
<pb facs="tcp:21216:13"/>
knowne to men, that if euer they come to him, they may
ſpeake their mindes in the confidence and truſt of this amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
name. Eſteeme it not ſtrange beloued, that the name of a
place is attributed to the Lord: for that he is a place of refuge,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> three things are able to prooue: Firſt, the witnes of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe:
ſecond, the confeſſion of the righteous: third, the word
<hi>(running)</hi> here vſed by king <hi>Salomon.</hi> As for the Lord he doth
attribute vnto himſelfe this name by the pen of the holy
Ghoſt, calling himſelfe a ſecret place, <hi>pſal 91. 1.</hi> a throne of
grace, <hi>Hebr. 4. 16.</hi> a refuge <hi>pſal. 9. 9.</hi> a fortreſſe, <hi>pſal. 18. 2.</hi> a
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſtrong towre, and ſuch lyke more. Secondly this is the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the righteous: Of <hi>Dauid</hi> the father in diuers places,
<hi>pſal. 18. 2.</hi> The Lord is my fortreſſe and my refuge: and in the

ioyfull deliuerance: and ſo <hi>Pſal 94. 22.</hi> This is alſo the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of the ſonne in this place: and of all the Saints of God,
vnto whoſe confeſſions I referre you, as they are ſet downe
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> by the holy Ghoſt in the booke of God. Thirdly, the word
<hi>(runneth)</hi> implieth as much, which giueth me entrance to the
ſecond point, opening vnto vs the feete which we neede to
goe vnto this place, the which if ye are deſirous to know, they
are two in number (Faith and Praier).<note place="margin">The feet to carry vs thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> Faith the firſt, for if
by faith we ſtand. <hi>2. Cor. 1. 24.</hi> by faith we may alſo goe to the
lord who is faithful. Now how could we go vnto him by the
feete of prayer, if we did not, beleeue in him? <hi>Rom 10. 14.</hi> The
ſecond, is prayer, a ſpirituall legge to beare vs thither, noted
by <hi>Salomon,</hi> making mention of <hi>running:</hi> by <hi>Ionas,</hi> ſpeaking of
comming. <hi>Iohn. 2. ver. 7.</hi> And my prayer come vnto thee in
thine holy temple By the Apoſtle, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſpeaketh of going,
let vs therfore goe vnto the throne of grace, <hi>Heb. 4. 16.</hi> Laſtly,
by the holy Ghoſt, vſing this word <hi>Climbing. Apoc. 8. 4.</hi> Both
the name of the place which is appointed for vs to goe vnto,
and the ſpirituall legs which the Lord hath giuen vs to carrie
vs thither, doe preach vnto the ſonnes of men the admirable
goodnes and mercie of the Lord toward them. In this world
wee are as pilgrims, <hi>Pſal. 119.</hi> hauing here no continuing
Citie, <hi>Heb 13. 14</hi> and while we are at home in the body, we
are abſent from the Lord, <hi>2. Cor. 5. 6.</hi> In which pilgrimage
<pb facs="tcp:21216:13"/>
               <hi>Many are the troubles of the righteous, Pſal. 34.</hi> O the great
goodneſſe of the Lord then, that hee hath giuen vs feete to
come vnto him, and made himſelfe a place of refuge for vs
in all our troubles! which goodneſſe is comfortable vnto the
faithfull: for as it is a comfort vnto the pilgrim, ſhepheard, or
ſouldier, to haue in the heate of the day a place of refuge to
refreſh their wearied members: So likewiſe what a comfort
is it for you O afflicted ſoules in the heate of your afflictions,
to haue the name of <hi>Iehouah</hi> for a ſacred Sanctuarie! the
Lord is not like vnto the princes of the earth, who deſire not
to be moleſted with the requeſts of their diſtreſſed ſubiects.
It is a ioy to the wearied ſtudent, that he may ſometime come
home to his fathers houſe and recreate himſelfe: Into this
world the Lord hath ſent vs as in an Vniuerſitie, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it is farre off from our fathers houſe, yet the Lord
hath giuen vs ſpirituall feete, by which in a moment we can
aſcend vnto our fathers houſe, and recreate there our wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
ſpirits. This world is a waſte deſart, if wee neede any
thing, here are the legges by which ſpeedily wee may runne
to this place, and prouide our ſelues. If the Lord hath caſt vs
downe vpon our beds, and that wee can not vſe the feete of
our bodies, behold, hee hath giuen vs other feete, to vſe in
ſteade of theſe. King <hi>Ezekias</hi> viſited with the plague, could
not vſe the feete of the fleſh, but with the feete of the ſpirit,
went vnto this place, knowen vnto him by the name of <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uah.
Ionas</hi> is locked vp in a priſon, in the belly of the Whale,
(the Lords priſon) and can not ſtirre himſelfe, and yet by the
vertue of theſe feete, out of the depth, he aſcendeth to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
temple of <hi>Iehouah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that theſe feete may be able to beare vs thither,<note place="margin">The hoſe to put on.</note> and
that they may not faile vs in our voyage, they muſt put on
the hoſe of faith: and as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, our feete muſt
be ſhod with the preparation of the Goſpell of peace. And
as the feete to that Image of <hi>Daniel</hi> were part of yron,<note place="margin">Ephe. 6. 15.</note> part of
clay, which the Prophet expoundeth partly ſtrong, partly
weake or broken:<note place="margin">Dan. 2. 42.</note> So the feete of our prayers are, according
to the hoſen wherewith they are couered; if they put on feare
<pb facs="tcp:21216:14"/>
and diſtruſtfulneſſe, they will bee ſhiuering and ſinking
downeward, of clay, weake, and impotent; if they put on
faith and confidence in the mercies of God, they will be feete
of yron, ſtrong, ſtable and firme, keeping vs vpright, and wil
carrie vs to the very throne of grace.</p>
            <p>Further,<note place="margin">A direction to know the way.</note> as they that depart into the Countrey, if they
know not the way to the place whereunto they goe, muſt
haue a guide, or a direction, becauſe they ſhould not erre; So
in the going to this place, becauſe there are ſo many falſe
guides and directions, the Lord himſelfe hath giuen vs a
carde of direction to leade vs thereunto, the witneſſe of his
holy word, written and ſealed, that can neuer deceiue vs. As
the fierie pillar in the deſart, ſhewed he way vnto the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites:
So this word of the Lord is a fierie pillar vnto vs in the
darke deſart of this world, to ſhew vs the way to that heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Canaan; it is the lanthorne vnto our feete, and a light to
our pathes, <hi>Pſal. 105.</hi> and therefore, according to the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our Sauiour,<note place="margin">Luk. 12. 35.</note> 
               <hi>Let our loynes be girded, and let vs beare in
our hands this ſhining light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. The right or intereſt which the faithfull haue to this place.</note> to goe to this place, it is neceſſarie to know
what right or intereſt we haue in it. In the places wherevn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
men betake their ſelues in the terme of plague, either they
haue ſome right or intereſt there, becauſe they are their own,
or becauſe they haue ſome friends or acquaintance there that
will receiue them; or laſtly, becauſe they haue either hired or
purchaſed a houſe. So likewiſe vnto the name of <hi>Iehouah,</hi>
the place where we ought to goe in the time of plague, as alſo
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> at all other times, we haue a ſpeciall right and interreſt. Firſt,
becauſe it is our owne, for hee is our God and our Lord, not
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> by nature, but by gift and donation. Secondly, there we haue
acquaintance and our beſt friends; God our father, Chriſt
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> our brother, the holy Ghoſt our comforter. Thirdly, becauſe
we haue purchaſed it; not we our ſelues, by corruptible gold,
or by our merites, but Chriſt for vs by his precious blood,
hath obtained this place of refuge for vs in our troubles. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,
1. Chron. 21. 17.</hi> in his prayer, ſheweth vpon what right
and encouragement in the time of plague hee went to this
<pb facs="tcp:21216:14"/>
place, <hi>(O Lord my God I beſeech thee, &amp;c.)</hi> it was then, becauſe
the Lord was his God; he had a particular feeling of the loue
of God toward him, and knew him to be his God for he had
had ſome experience of deliuerance. The reaſon why wee
muſt haue this right, is becauſe being infected with the
plague of ſinne, we ſhould not be receiued. In the Countrie,
they will not receiue thoſe that are infected with the plague:
Neither can they alſo, in whoſe ſoules the plague of ſinne
doth reigne, be admitted to this place, and therfore the Lord
hath giuen vs Chriſt the righteous, to couer our vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
that thus as pure and cleane wee might come vnto
him. I know by mine owne experience, that in the Countrie
this yeere, they would not admit ſome that came from the
Citie, vnleſſe they had put on new apparrell. To come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that heauenly Ieruſalem by the feete of prayer, we cannot
be admitted,<note place="margin">Ephe. 4. 24.</note> except we put off the olde man, and put on the
new man which is created in righteouſneſſe, and therefore,
that we ſhould not be hindered to goe thither, <hi>He hath put on
vs, the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, Rom. 13. 14.</hi> that being adorned
with his righteouſneſſe and holineſſe, as <hi>Iacob</hi> was with the
garment of his brother <hi>Eſau, We might with confidence approach
to the throne of grace, Heb. 4.</hi> It is onely then in the name of
Chriſt that we muſt goe to the name of <hi>Iehouah, Ioh. 14. 14.
Ioh. 5. 7. Mat. 21. 22. Ioh. 16. 14. 1. Tim. 2. 5. 1. Ioh. 2. 1.</hi> In
his name, the poore <hi>Lazarus</hi> hath as much right to goe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, as King <hi>Salomon:</hi> the infected as the ſound: the learned
as the vnlearned: for Chriſt prayeth for them all: and as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi>
ſpeaketh, Chriſt prayeth with vs all as our brother; he
prayeth in vs all as our head, hee is prayed vnto by vs all, as
our Lord, but hee prayeth for vs all, as our high Prieſt. Let
then the Romaniſts in the time of plague, runne vnto the
name of <hi>Iehouah,</hi> in the name of Saint <hi>Sebaſtian;</hi> Alas, they
ſhall not be admitted: for Chriſt alone, as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſpeaketh,
is the eye wherewith wee ſee the father, the hand to offer vp
our prayers, and the mouth to ſpeake vnto him. But as for vs,
with <hi>Dauid</hi> let vs goe vnto him by force of this right, ſaying
with him, <hi>O Lord our God, we beſeech thee, &amp;c.</hi>

it by the example of King <hi>Dauid</hi> in generall,<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any exception, in all manner of perſons; which their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
conceit I will not heere refute, I referre the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to that learned Treatiſe of that reuerend father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Theodorus
Beza,</hi> written touching this matter, wherein he learnedly,
ſoundly and religiouſly refuteth their groſſe opinion; onely
let me deſtroy their building which they erect vpon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of King <hi>Dauid.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anſwere.</note> Foure particulars can hinder them to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> make a generall concluſion out of this example: Firſt, the
ſhort continuance of that plague, for the ſpace of three dayes,
or of a halfe of a day, as ſome of the learned are of opinion;
whoſe reaſons I will not alleadge, which left him no time to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> deliberate vpon departure. Secondly, the generalitie of the
Peſtilence, being ſpred from <hi>Dan</hi> to <hi>Beerſhebah,</hi> which left
him no place free to go vnto: for whither ſhould he flie ſeeing
that the peſtilence was ſpread all ouer the land: <hi>2. Sam. 24.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, his owne guiltineſſe, that plague being cauſed by
his ſinne, the numbring of the people, which cauſed ſuch a
ſorrow in <hi>Dauid,</hi> that he was readie by his owne death to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme
the publike calamitie, praying vnto the Lord, <hi>1. Chro.
21. 17. O Lord my God I beſeech thee, let thine hand be on mee,
and on my fathers houſe, and not on thy people for their deſtruction.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, the ſoundneſſe of Ieruſalem, the place where hee
was, the Angel hauing not yet, or very ſparingly touched
the head Citie, <hi>1. Chron. 21. 15.</hi> the Lord repenting of the
euill, when the Angel came to Ieruſalem: theſe foure parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
<pb facs="tcp:21216:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are able to caſt downe their building, and to diſprooue
their conſequence: <hi>Dauid</hi> fled not, <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is vnlawfull for
any man to depart: the true conſequence, if we would argue
out of this place, might be this: <hi>Dauid</hi> and the Elders depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
not: <hi>Ergo,</hi> let not Magiſtrate forſake his Citie, nor the
Miniſter his flocke. Hauing pluckt out the weedes and the
thiſtles, let vs as the good husbandman ſow the good ſeede.
As this then prooueth not the vnlawfulneſſe of departure; ſo
on the other ſide, it doth commend vnto vs king <hi>Dauids</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">The true vſe of the example</note>
and his ſpiritual departure, teaching vs that in the time of
plague, our firſt and principall care ought to bee, as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our departure, as in our departure if wee are ſo minded,
(for I vrge no neceſſitie of it) to flie and runne by the feete of
faith and prayer to the name of the Lord, which being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
omitted, or negligently practiſed, maketh our depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
vnlawfull. Imitate the King then O yee righteous
ſoules in this tempeſt of the plague, let your ſoules take (the
wings of a Doue) the motion and agility of the ſpirit of God,
and let them flie by the ſtrength of their prayers to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
of Gods mercies where they ſhall bee at reſt. <hi>Dauid</hi> in
this his going to the name of the Lord, hath ſhowen and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted
foure things: His Conſcience, Humilitie, Memorie,
Wiſedome. His Conſcience, that it was good: his Humilitie
great: his Memorie holy: his Wiſedome right.</p>
            <p>Touching the firſt, the ſpirit of prayer is a ſigne of a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
good Conſcience; for as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Lib. de caſt.
Oratio de conſcientia procedit, ſi conſcientia erubeſcat, erubeſcet
oratio.</hi> Prayer doeth proceede from the Conſcience: if the
Conſcience bluſh, prayer will alſo bee aſhamed. O it is an
excellent thing that we can giue our ſelues to this holy exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe:
let one haue riches, honour, pleaſures, let him bee ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
as a little god, if hee haue not the ſpirit of prayer to puſh
him forward with <hi>Dauid,</hi> in the midſt of his felicitie, hee is
moſt miſerable.</p>
            <p>Secondly, his miſerie and humilitie, for a King is become <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
a begger, and at the gate of the King of heauen he vſeth ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of ſubmiſſion. <hi>(I beſeech thee O Lord)</hi> Loe here, O proud
<pb facs="tcp:21216:16"/>
ſonne of <hi>Adam,</hi> of thy ſelfe thou haſt nothing, but like a poore
ſuppliant begger thou are conſtrained to goe before the gate
of that right God, aſwel the king that ſitteth vpon his throne,
as poore <hi>Laxarus</hi> that ſiteth before the doore of the rich man.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Thirdly his memory, the ſubiect wherof was the Lord, O ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
remembrance! Although he had as it were forgotten him
by his ſinne in his proſperitie, yet he remembreth him by his
praier in his affliction: O the excellencie of praier, it is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
of our beſt friend, whoſe remembrance is comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to our diſtreſſed ſoules. The ſubiect of our memories,
haue beene along time commodities, pleaſures riches, honor,
triumphs, and therfore ô England behold another ſubiect to
exerciſe the art of thy memorie: If then we haue forgotten
him in our proſperitie by our ſinne, let vs now remember
him by our feruent praier in our affliction. Many haue
practiſed the art of memorie according to the memoratiue
Art, and preceptes of memorie, which appoint places and
their furniture, for the helpe of ſuch as are vnexperienced;
but let vs practiſe the art of this holy memorie, let God be the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſubiect, and in this our affliction, let theſe be our helpes: Firſt
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> let vs remember in our praier the commandement of God,
<hi>Pſal. 50.</hi> Secondly the name of him, whom we call vpon, that
it is <hi>Iehouoh,</hi> Lord, our God, a God not in ſhew, but in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
and performance: a ſtrong God, a towre of defence,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> they that knowe this name wil truſt in him, <hi>Pſal. 9. 10.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
what he is by nature, how ſweete and amiable, how rich in
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> mercie, <hi>Ephe. 2.</hi> Fourthly, what he is by promiſe, how faithfull
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> and true, <hi>2. Tim. 1. 3.</hi> Laſtly what he is by couenant, made vnto
<hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeede, not in the blood of bulles, but in the blood
of the ſeede of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Further, <hi>Dauid</hi> hath ſhewen his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and that in the choice of the place, taking his marke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
and directing his petition to the true and proper peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ode.
Imitate the wiſdome of king <hi>Dauid</hi> in his choice, he that
goeth to a place, runneth aright and wiſely, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he be wiſe, and
not by crooked and erroneous waies: <hi>Dauid</hi> ſheweth vs the
right way, for to what place ſhould we goe but to this, when
our ſorrowes are multiplied? ſhall we follow the waies of the
<pb facs="tcp:21216:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wicked, and ſay with them, <hi>Malac. 3. It is in vaine, that I haue
ſerued him, and what profit is it, that I haue kept his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</hi>
Or ſhall wee runne vpon the way of impatience, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
griefe to griefe, liuing the life of <hi>Caine,</hi> or dying the
death of <hi>Iudas,</hi> drowning our ſoules in a gulfe of deſperation?
Shall wee ſpend the time in bannings, execrations, curſing
the day and night, the earth that beareth vs, the ayre that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpireth
vs? Not ſo O Chriſtian ſoules, call vpon the name of
the Lord with <hi>Dauid,</hi> there was neuer name ſo worthie to be
called vpon, in heauen or earth, ſo mightie for deliuerance,
ſo ſure for protection, ſo gainefull for ſucceſſe, ſo compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to cut off vnneceſſarie labours as the name of <hi>Iehouah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hauing vnderſtood the Conſcience,<note place="margin">The cauſes to mooue vs to goe to this place.</note> Humilitie, Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
and Wiſedome of <hi>Dauid,</hi> let me open to you the reaſons
to mooue and perſwade vs to goe to this place. Fiue things
mooue the ſonnes of men in the time of plague to depart
from contagious places, vnto a purer ayre. Firſt the counſel
of the Phyſitians. Secondly, the practiſe of others. Thirdly,
the danger or perill which they are like to fall in. Fourthly,
deſire of health and life. Fifthly, the experience of ſucceſſe.
Let the ſame bee motiues vnto vs in this infection, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
vs to runne ſpeedily vnto this Arke of <hi>Noah.</hi> Firſt, it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
is preſcribed by the whole Colledge of the ſpirituall Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
by God the father, <hi>Pſal. 50. 15.</hi> King <hi>Dauids</hi> Phyſitian;
by God the ſonne, who preſcribing the remedies which men
ought to vſe in the laſt dayes, in which the Trinitie of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
famine, warres, and peſtilence ſhould raigne, giueth
this counſell, <hi>Luk. 21. 36. Watch and pray continually;</hi> by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
Apoſtles, and wiſe men, <hi>Iam. 5. 13. Eccle. 38. 9.</hi> and
17, 23. Secondly, the practiſe of the ſpirituall Phyſitians, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
they haue preſcribed it, ſo they haue alſo practiſed it, and
haue fled vnto this place; to this Sanctuarie went the renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Patriarkes, the godly Princes, the holy Prophets, the
bleſſed Apoſtles, the Prince of glorie, the ſonne of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall
God, the conſtant Martyrs: whoſe examples yee
ſhall finde in the ſtore-houſe of the Scriptures. The exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the bodily Phyſitians, of which ſome depart in the
<pb facs="tcp:21216:17"/>
time of plague, hath much force to make vs haſten our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture;
how much more ought the practiſe of the ſpirituall
phyſitions ſpurre vs forward vpon our ſpirituall voyage.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, the danger, which is threefold, <hi>(In nobis, circa nos,
contra nos)</hi> In vs, round about vs, againſt vs. In vs, the plague
of ſinne: round about vs, the fire of the preſent plague: againſt
vs, Sathan who ſeeketh to make vs curſe the Lord, and the
fire of Gods wrath and anger: To auoide this threefold
danger, runne to the Arke and to this bleſſed Zoar. The
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> fourth motiue, is the deſire of life and health; we neede at this
time a double health, the health of the ſoule and body: let vs
therefore goe boldly vnto the throne of grace, that wee may
receiue mercie, and finde grace to helpe in time of neede,
<hi>Heb. 4. 16.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 9. 20.</note> Why went that woman which was diſeaſed with
an iſſue of blood twelue yeares vnto Chriſt, but that ſhee
might receiue her health: <hi>Verſ. 12.</hi> The ſickneſſe of the
plague is an iſſue of blood, which being once opened, will
euer runne, and keepe a courſe if it bee not ſtanched by the
power and mercie of God: which mercie is onely obtained,
by going vnto his ſacred name: to obtaine this double health,
<hi>Dauid</hi> went vnto this place, <hi>1. Chron. 21.</hi> that the plague of
his ſoule might be healed, and the bodily plague bee remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
If we are as it were dead for ſorrow, prayer will reuiue
vs, for it is <hi>Vita animae,</hi> the life of the ſoule: and as <hi>Chryſostome</hi>
termeth it, <hi>Eſt anima ipſius animae.</hi> It is the ſoule of the ſoule. If
we goe into the Countrey which cannot ſaue vs; how much
more ought we to flie to this name, which hath the power to
doe it: this his power, being acompanied with mercie and
kindneſſe, for thou O Lord, art good and gracious, and of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> great compaſſion, <hi>Pſal. 86.</hi> Fiftly, experience of good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe,
is the laſt motiue, they which haue fled to this place,
haue not beene ſtopped by the way, but haue had good
ſpeede. Goe vnto King <hi>Eezekias, Iob, Dauid,</hi> and the reſt,
and they will preach vnto you by experience, the experience
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of this ſucceſſe. This ſucceſſe is grounded vpon three things,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> as vpon three firme pillars, the power, the will and promiſe,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the goodneſſe and mercie of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:21216:17"/>
His power, <hi>I haue heard it that power belongeth vnto God,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <hi>Pſal. 62, 11.</hi> There was neuer affliction or ſore ſo great, but
the hand of that Phyſitian hath beene able to maſter it, the
leaſt finger of his right hand being of more puiſſance, then
the whole arme of fleſh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His will and promiſe, Pſal 91. 1. Ioel 2. 32. Iam. 5. 15. Eccle.</hi>

who anſwered vnto the widow comming in his Court
to him, to be heard, I am not at leiſure, (vnto which alſo ſhee
anſwered iuſtly, then bee not a King any longer) for ſeeing
that he hath promiſed it, he is alſo willing, his promiſe being
ſigned with the finger of the holy Ghoſt, and ſealed with the
blood of his beloued and annoynted. Neither is he like vnto
him, <hi>Matth. 7.</hi> who anſwered, trouble mee not, my doores
are ſhut; the gate of heauen is alwayes open for vs. God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoketh
not his promiſe as King <hi>Salomon, 1. Reg. 2. 20. 21.
23. Aske my mother, for I will not ſay thee nay;</hi> and yet behold
how this time is changed, <hi>Adoniah</hi> hath ſpoken this word a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his owne life; of the Lords promiſe wee neede not
doubt, but with <hi>Dauid</hi> boldly we may ſpeake, <hi>Pſal. 86. 7. In
the day of my trouble I will call vpon thee, for thou wilt heare me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>His goodneſſe, mercie, and liberalitie, which is ſo</hi>

               <hi>great that he giueth meate to the yong rauens which call vpon him,
Pſal. 147. 9.</hi> Doubt not then, but that hee will heare the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
of men, whom he hath made a little lower then the
Angels, to crowne them with glorie aboue other creatures,
<hi>Pſal. 8. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6.</hi> Let therefore, ſaith <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> thy prayer aſcend,
and Gods mercie will deſcend; ſhall wee diſtruſt his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
who is rich to all that call vpon him? <hi>Rom. 10. 12.</hi> Or
ſhall we ſuſpect his bountifulneſſe, which powreth out plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
his bleſſings vpon all fleſh? <hi>Rom. 8. 32.</hi> And although
wee haue offended him, yet our offences will not ſtop his
mercies. Men, when they haue done any good turne to any,
if they bee neuer ſo little offended, they caſt men in the teeth
with the benefits they haue done them, and vpbraide them
with the good turnes they haue ſhewed; wherefore men are
<pb facs="tcp:21216:18"/>
loath to make requeſt to ſuch for any thing: If wee goe vnto
the Lord, we ſhal not meete with one that is of ſuch a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and nature:<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 5.</note> he, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, reproacheth no
man; nor keepeth his anger for euer, <hi>Pſal 103<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9.</hi> The wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe,
mercie, and goodneſſe of the Prince to haue vs,
maketh vs alſo willing to goe to him; who more willing, then
he that is our Father, our Sauiour, then he that hath ſuffered
for vs, ſcoffings, ſpittings, bands, ſtripes, and death it ſelfe?
Neuer lap of the mother hath beene ſo open to her babes, as
the bowels of Gods compaſſions are open to the righteous.
Harken to this, yee faint ſpirits, be ſtrengthened yee weake
hands and feeble knees, receiue this comfort, that he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered,
he doth deliuer, hee yet will and can deliuer. I ende
this point with the 13. 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and 15. verſes of the 10. Chapter
of the Epiſtle to the Romanes: wherein behold a ſingular
and compendious gradation. As they that would come to
King <hi>Salomon</hi> ſitting vpon his throne, were faine to runne
vp ſixe ſtaires (for his throne was mounted vnto by ſixe
ſtaires) ſo the perfection and conſummation of man going
to the throne of the true <hi>Salomon</hi> Ieſus Chriſt aſcendeth and
ariſeth by ſixe degrees: the higheſt and the happieſt ſtaires
being, inuocating and ſauing, prayer and deliuerance. Theſe
are then the fiue reaſons, by which wiſe Chriſtians ought to
bee guided. I imitate King <hi>Dauid,</hi> onely reſorting to the
wings of the Lords fauour. And herein we ſhould be wiſe,
if we leuell our hearts and affections at the very right center
and marke of prayer (which is the name of <hi>Iehouah</hi> alone) and
the period or ſcope in whom our requeſts muſt end.</p>
            <p>But alas,<note place="margin">Fiue ſorts of men erring in the going to this place.</note> there are fiue ſortes of men, which make choice
of other places, reiecting the wiſedome of <hi>Dauid,</hi> the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
of the ſpirituall Phyſitions, and the practiſe of the Saints
of God, going a crooked, a circular, and endleſſe way, not
towards the marke, nor with a right foote as the Apoſtle
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſpeaketh, <hi>Gal. 2.</hi> The firſt kind, flie firſt to the helpe of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall

<pb facs="tcp:21216:18"/>
that the Lord ſendeth his Sergiant and heauenly Purſiphant
to arreſt them, then they returne to runne to this place. What
name ſhall wee giue you (O yee of little faith) but the name
of weake Chriſtians? Put not your truſt in the ſonne of man,
for there is no helpe in him, <hi>Pſal. 146.</hi> There is a ſecond <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
ſort, which runne onely to the ordinarie creatures, deriding
the name of <hi>Iehouah,</hi> yea denying that there euer hath beene,

the righteous is preſerued, ſuch as <hi>Dauid</hi> deſcribeth in the <hi>10.
Pſalme, 3. 4. Which ſeeke not God, but contemne him, and thinke
they ſhall neuer be mooued.</hi> O yee meere Atheiſts, what name
deſerue you, but that name, which the Lord himſelfe giueth

becauſe he offered an vnworthie ſacrifice, what deſerue
they that offer none at all? The third ſort runne to a place,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
whoſe name is Hell, ſeeking to Sathan and his artes, gadding
to the woman of Endor, or to the Idoll of Ekron, a <hi>Saul,</hi> a
<hi>Nero,</hi> a <hi>Iulian:</hi> Returne, returne, O yee wretched and bewit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
ſonnes of men, with the name of diuelliſh idolaters. The
fourth ſort, ſeeketh to dwell vnder the protection and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
of their merites and good workes: but theſe alas, as

there followeth in the two places, the condition, properties,
qualitie and ſafeneſſe of the place whereunto we muſt runne
in the time of the plague. The ſonnes of men in the time of
infection, before their departure, haue a ſpeciall regard of the
place where they will goe, of the ſituation, nature, and ſuch
like, and being led by the preſcription of the Phyſitian: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
by their owne minde, they make choyſe commonly
of a place in which they perceiue theſe ſeuen properties fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing:
and although <hi>Salomon</hi> here maketh mention but of
one, namely of a ſafe place, yet giue me leaue to diſcourſe of
the reſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt, they goe where there is a good, wholeſome and

preſcription of the phyſitians, that wee ſhould goe vnto pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
where the ayre is not corrupted, farre from the infection.
<hi>Dauid</hi> fled to ſuch a place, for ſuch is the name of <hi>Iehouah,</hi> a
pure place, farre from the corruptions of this world, for hee
is a pure, and incorruptible God, in whom there is no infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of ſinne: the Lord, holy, holy, holy, not admitting thoſe
in whoſe mortall bodies the plague of ſinne doeth raigne: to
pray then and to repent, is to returne and go to a wholeſome
light, <hi>Eccle. 17. 24.</hi> The places wherevnto the ſonnes of men
<pb facs="tcp:21216:20"/>
flie, although they are for a time vncorrupted, yet they are
not warranted ſtill ſo to remaine, diuers alterations by ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie
meanes may befall, as by the reſort of perſons infected,
and ſuch like: but the name of <hi>Iehouah,</hi> this place of refuge,
ſhall neuer be altered, for he is the immutable and vnchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
God, and in the gates of that Citie no vncleane perſon
ſhall enter, <hi>Apoc. 22. 14, 15.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. A pleaſant place.</note> men make choyſe of a pleaſant and delectable
place, both for their bodies and ſoules, where there is good
companie to recreate themſelues in their ſorrow and exile,
foode and neceſſaries for their bodies, further by the riuer
ſide, or where there is good water: laſtly, where they may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
haue foode for their ſoules, the word of God Preached.
This place of refuge, the name of <hi>Iehouah,</hi> is a pleaſant and
delectable place, where canſt thou better recreate thy ſelfe,
then by thy Father and brother Ieſus Chriſt in this thy exile
and miſerie? Comfortable is the boſome of the mother to the
yong infant, but more comfortable is the name of the Lord
to the righteous which are called little babes by the Apoſtle.
<hi>Paul</hi> maketh mention in his voyage toward Rome, of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
place which was called <hi>(The faire hauens) Act. 27.</hi> this
place of refuge better deſerueth this name, let vs goe thither,
for it is a harbour and rode for thoſe which are toſſed in the
ſea and deluge of the Peſtilence: happie is the ſoule that lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
at theſe hauens. If we deſire water, there is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of life: <hi>Iere. 2.</hi> the water of grace, <hi>Pſal. 51.</hi> If wee deſire
the word; there is the word it ſelf Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Ioh. 1.</hi> the truth,
<hi>Ioh. 14.</hi> There is the beſt, the firſt, the ancienteſt Preacher,
God himſelfe that preached in Paradiſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. A ſafe place.</note> in our choyſe we ſeeke out a ſafe place, whither
we may goe without danger, and where wee may abide ſafe,
and dwell without danger. The name of <hi>Iehouah</hi> is a ſafe
harbour, the ſecret place and ſhadow of the moſt high,
<hi>Pſal. 91. 1.</hi> vnder whoſe wings we ſhal abide ſafe and harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Three things prooue the ſafenes of this place: Firſt, the

               <pb facs="tcp:21216:20"/>
Such are not the fortreſſes of mortall men, which they
are conſtrained to render vp, being driuen therevnto either
by famine, or force, as <hi>Seba</hi> in the time of <hi>Dauid</hi> hereof is a
witneſſe. Secondly, the Lord of the ſoyle, which inhabiteth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
that place, his name is <hi>Iehouah:</hi> the Almightie, <hi>Pſal. 91. 1.</hi> the
ſtrong and inuincible God, who will and is able to preſerue
vs. Thirdly, it is prooued by the ſucceſſe of thoſe who runne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
to it, and by that which they receiue, they are (exalted, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued
or deliuered, ſaith <hi>Salomon)</hi> which <hi>Dauid</hi> acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth,
<hi>Pſal 32. 7.</hi> and is confirmed by the ſucceſſe of <hi>Dauids</hi>
prayer, <hi>2. Sam 24. 25.</hi> and the plague ceaſed from Iſrael.
Comfortable is the ſaying of <hi>Dauid, Pſal. 91<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. 15, 16.</hi> in
which, ſixe things prooue the happie ſucceſſe of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

to honour: Fiftly, length of dayes: Sixtly, frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſaluation: O the excellent riches, pleaſures, and ioyes
which the righteous there ſhall enioy. As <hi>Lot</hi> there ſled
vnto little Zoar to bee preſerued from the fire of <hi>Sodome:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gene. 18.</note> So
let vs flie to the name of <hi>Iehouah,</hi> to be ſafe from the fire of the
plague. The earthly places wherevnto men runne, do want
this propertie: they are not warranted to be ſafe there, either
from danger or from the plague, and the experience of this
yeere doeth declare it vnto vs all. Some haue returned, and
ſome haue died there, but as for the name of <hi>Iehouah,</hi> thy
ſoule is certaine to be preſerued, if thither ſhee taketh her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe;
and as they onely eſcaped the flood, that entred into
the Arke of <hi>Noah:</hi> So likewiſe, they that enter into this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible
and immortall Arke, ſhall onely bee ſafegarded
from the deluge of afflictions. The Doue of <hi>Noah</hi> at her firſt
flight from the Arke, although ſhee mounted aloft, and fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
many retires, yet ſhee could finde no reſting place, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
ſhee returned againe to the Arke: So the poore ſoule may
flie where ſhee will, but yet ſhee ſhall not haue any ſure foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to reſt, except ſhee returne to the heauenly Arke: let vs
therefore bee wiſe as Serpents, and ſimple as Doues, for as
they being perſecuted, flie vnto the rockes; ſo let vs in our
<pb facs="tcp:21216:21"/>
calamities take our recourſe to the rocke of <hi>Dauid, Pſal. 18. 2.</hi>
neuer haue there beene holes in the rockes ſo open for the
doues, as the name of <hi>Iehouah</hi> for the righteous ſoules. There
are two renowned places mentioned by <hi>Plinie, Locris, and
Crotone,</hi> where the plague was neuer, as he writeth <hi>lib 1. cap.
96.</hi> and without doubt many reſorted thither: but although
we ſhould flie at this day to <hi>Locris</hi> and <hi>Crotone,</hi> if we carrie
within vs the plague of ſinne, the inward cauſe of the bodilie
contagion, we haue no warrant to bee ſafegarded. But me
thinkes I heare a controuerſie:<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> Many righteous haue fled to
the name of the Lord, and yet haue not beene ſafe from the
deluge of the peſtilence, or from the ſnare of the hunter: but
thouſands, and thouſands are fallen, yea ſome of the choſen of
Iſrael. The anſwere is, that they haue firſt obtained, either that
which they prayed for;<note place="margin">Anſwere.</note> ſecondly, or that which is better; or
thirdly, that which is ſufficient And the Lord heareth vs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,
although alwaies he granteth not our petition: this
ſeemeth a Paradoxe, and yet the trueth thereof is manifeſt:
for in ſteed of that we asked, he giueth vs a better thing, and a
better place: thou askeſt the earth, ſaith <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and the
Lord giueth thee heauen: temporall life, and he giueth thee
the eternal. The Surgion that ſaweth off the arme or legge of
the patient, who crieth for impatience and apprehenſion;
heareth him, <hi>Non ſecundum voluntatem ſed ſanitatem,</hi> not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his will, but according to his health: and ſo the
Lord dealeth with his patients.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">A place where they haue friends.</note> to proceede, men make choice of places where
they haue their friends: the children reſort to their parents, the
parents to their children, brethren to their brethren, and one
friend to another. The name of the Lord is a place of refuge
where we haue our beſt friends, there we haue our father, our
eldeſt brother Chriſt Ieſus, the holy Ghoſt our comforter:
and therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> in the time of plague went to this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
place. In earthly places vnto which the ſonnes of men
reſort, either we haue no friends, or they are farre off, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wee ſeeke other: or ſometimes although we haue friends,
yet they will not receiue vs for feare of infection: but in this
<pb facs="tcp:21216:21"/>
holy temple, and vpon this holy mountaine, we are ſure to
finde at all times the aforeſaid friends.</p>
            <p>Fiftly,<note place="margin">5. A place acceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for all men</note> we haue regard to chooſe a place which is lawful for
all men to come vnto, which is not prohibited or forbidden
by the Lord of the ſoyle &amp; magiſtrate of the place, and where
we knowe we ſhall be receiued. This place of refuge is ſuch,
acceſſible for all men, for whoſoeuer ſhall call on the name of
the Lord, ſhall be ſaued, <hi>Ioel. 2. 32.</hi> Neuer a cittie of refuge ſo
free for all manner of tranſgreſſions: hither may come the
King and the ſubiect, the rich and the poore, the learned and
the vnlearned, the merchant and the tradeſman: the ſound
and the ſicke, yea the infected with the plague. In the time of
infection, it is not lawfull for them that dwell where the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion
raigneth, to come vnto the princes court, they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
by proclamation to reſort thither. But the court of

<hi>Luc. 12.</hi> Further in time of contagion, not only the court, but
alſo the other citties, townes and villages, will not often lodge
them that come from contagious places, either the Lord of
the ſoile, or the magiſtrate of thoſe places forbidding it; but as
for that heauenly Ieruſalem, and the Lord of the liuing, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
euery one may reſorte, the Lord and magiſtrate of
heauen doeth not interdict it. <hi>Dauid</hi> cried vnto the Lord, and
ſaid, thou art my portion in the land of the liuing. <hi>Pſal. 142. 5.</hi>
At Roome the houſen of the <hi>Aediles,</hi> were alwaies open for
all men, that they might reſort thither, to haue their cauſes
heard: and ſo is the houſe of the Lord for the afflicted ſoules.
In ſome places there are appointed (as I my ſelfe haue ſeene)
watchmenwith halbards, to aske the paſſengers from whence
they come, and ſometimes to keepe out thoſe that come from
infected places, but in our going to this place, we neede not
to haue ſuch feare, for as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith, <hi>Hic non eſt miles aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtens

thee out. If the citties of the earth ſhut their gates before thee,
thou canſt not enter. As for that heauenly Ieruſalem, it is not
lockt, and although it were, prayer as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaketh is a

manie enter, they will hinder one another; this fortreſſe can
receiue millions and millions without any impediment. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the temple is alſo interdicted to the infected, for they are
commanded by the magiſtrate to keepe their houſen for a
time, or if they come, they are entreated to ſitte aſide: but the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> for thoſe which are equall vnto vs: Thirdly, for thoſe which

nos,</hi> againſt vs. In the going to the name of the Lord, wee
muſt not imitate the negligence of many, who depart into
the Countrey, and care onely for themſelues; as for their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
or at leaſt their ſeruants, they are not once mindfull of
them: but wee muſt as well carrie with vs in our prayers, the
ſeruants which are vnder vs, as ſhee that lieth in our boſome:
<hi>And the Oliue plants which are round about our tables, Pſal. 108.</hi>
3. The Athenians would offer ſacrifice, but onely for their
owne Citie, and their neighbours of <hi>Chios:</hi> but wee Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
muſt pray, not onely for the mother Citie, but for all the
daughters: Chriſt teaching vs to ſay, <hi>Our father, &amp;c.</hi> as if we
all came from one wombe. It is a principle both of nature
and policie, <hi>Vis vnita fortior,</hi> Srength vnited, receiueth more
ſtrength. It holdeth likewiſe in Diuinitie. If the prayer of
one righteous perſon auaileth much, the prayer of many
righteous ſhall auile more. If the <hi>Syrophenician</hi> obtained for
her daughter the ſute ſhee made, much more the whole
Church of England ſhal obtaine for all her daughters: <hi>Where
two or three be gathered together in his name, he is in the midſt of
them:</hi> Much rather in the midſt of a people, in the midſt of
thouſands, in whom there is <hi>Anima vna, cor vnum:</hi> One ſoule,
one heart, one tongue, as if they were all but one man. Lord,
heale the ſores of our land, for behold, both the mother and
the daughters, the head and the members doo proſtrate our
ſelues before his Maieſtie. Yee of the ſect of <hi>Rome,</hi> diuide
not at this time of the plague in your prayers, the ſoule, the
voice and language of the Countrey into two places: <hi>Elias</hi>
and his companie, praying in one place and with one ſtile:
<hi>O Lord God of Abraham,</hi> and yee in another: <hi>O</hi> Baal <hi>heale vs:</hi>
Some praying for the life of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and ſome for the life of
<hi>Iabin.</hi> As for vs, we will pray for the Lords annoynted, that
God may hide him vnder the ſhadow of his wings from the
noyſome peſtilence, knowing that this is one of the parts of
our obedience towards him, that we (as <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great
taught his ſouldiers to ſhew their allegiance in nothing more
then this) ſhould pray for him, his children and poſteritie. I
end this point, with the ſaying of an ancient Father: That
<pb facs="tcp:21216:24"/>
there is no better garde, or Halbards to ſafegard a Prince,
then the prayers of the righteous.</p>
            <p>Before I come to the third branch of this diſcourſe,<note place="margin">Three rules to be obſerued in our going to this place.</note> giue
leaue Chriſtan Readers to the ſpirituall Phyſitians, to lay
downe three rules, which are to be obſerued in this our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
departure to the name of the Lord. The bodily Phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
touching departure preſcribe three rules, <hi>Longè, cuò,
tardè:</hi> Goe farre off, depart ſpeedily, returne ſlowly. The
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſame rules are to be obſerued by the righteous: Firſt, we muſt
flie farre,<note place="margin">Longè.</note> not with the prodigall and forlorne ſonne in a farre
Countrey, farre from the feare of God and thought of death,
or with <hi>Ionas</hi> from the preſence of the Lord, who rideth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Cherubims and can ouertake vs: for whither ſhall I
goe ſaith <hi>Dauid,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 139. 9.</note> from thy ſpirit? Or whither ſhall I flee from
thy preſence? But farre from this world and the earth, vnto
the holy temple and mountaine, vnto heauen which is high
aboue the earth, as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Pſal 103. 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> vnto that
place which is called the land of the liuing. Secondly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> flie
farre from the plague of ſinne, and the infected ayre of this
world, and being come vnto that farre Countrey, the Lord
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of the ſoyle will receiue you. The ſecond rule is, flie ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">Citò.</note>
and deferre not your departure: which rule is not in any
maner to be omitted, it is the counſell of the wiſe man, <hi>Ieſus
Syrach, Eccle. 38<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> My ſonne faile not in thy ſickneſſe but prays
vnto the Lord, and he will make thee whole.</hi> Tis the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
of the Lord to call vpon him in the time of neede,
<hi>Pſal. 50.</hi> Which muſt be performed with ſpeede, according
to the example of <hi>Dauid, Pſal 119. I will runne the wayes of
thy Commandements.</hi> If we make haſte to flie into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
and forget to goe ſpeedily vnto this Sanctuarie: it is as
<hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaketh of another matter, <hi>Curſus celerrimus prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
viam:</hi> A ſwift race beſides the way. Haſte in this matter
is prayſe worthie, and a man can neuer run too faſt that run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to this place. The delay that <hi>Elizeus</hi> made, let mee goe
kiſſe my Father; and thoſe ſhifts in the Goſpel: Let me firſt
goe burie my mother, or take leaue of my friends, are not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in this buſineſſe: commune not therefore with fleſh
<pb facs="tcp:21216:24"/>
and blood. If in the time of plague, we make ſuch haſte to
depart, before we haue ordained our buſineſſe aright, or bad
our friends farewell: How much more ought wee to haſten
our ſpirituall voyage? While the fal-bridge is let downe, let
vs make ſpeede to enter. Many, becauſe they went not farre,
not made ſpeed to depart, haue endangered their bodies, but
many more, becauſe they fled not from the contagion of
ſinne with ſpeede, haue endangered their ſoules: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>1. Cor. 9.</hi> of another matter, ſo
I may ſay of this going: <hi>So runne that yee may obtaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third rule is,<note place="margin">Tardè.</note> Returne ſlowly: that is, continue where <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
thou art: a neceſſarie rule to bee obſerued in the going to the
the name of the Lord. It is the rule of the ſpirituall Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<hi>Ephe. 6. 18. Rom. 12. 1. Theſ. 5. Pray continually, &amp;c.</hi> As
it is preſcribed,<note place="margin">Lukk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 36.</note> ſo it hath beene practiſed: the woman of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan
continued in her prayer, and returned not in haſte.
They which are in the Countrey, although there bee many
things which might mooue them to returne, yet for the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of their bodies, they continue till the plague be ceaſed: So
continue in thy prayer by the Lord, and be not wearie of wel
doing. Although three things might haue mooued thy <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rophenician</hi>
to returne, the ſilence of Chriſt, her back-friends,
and the odious names giuen vnto her: yet theſe diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
her poore ſoule digeſted, obtaining both a cure for her
daughters infirmitie, and a commendation for her faith. O
woman thou haſt wrought a myracle by the perſeuerance of
thy prayer, and haſt giuen to thy Sauiour occaſion to doo a
memorable act, conuenient to his nature: glorious to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
name. Let vs at this time follow her perſeuerance, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Lord ſhould ſeeme to be ſilent for a time, yet let
vs not draw backe, that wee may receiue a cure both for our
ſoules and bodies, and deſerue a commendation both by
God and other nations, and thereby giue occaſion vnto the
Lord to ſhew his omnipotent power in the ceaſing of the
plague: and to doo an act in England conuenient to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and glorious to his holy name. And as <hi>Iacob</hi> wraſtled
with the Angel and would not let him goe vntill hee had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
<pb facs="tcp:21216:25"/>
the bleſſing: So let vs as it were ſtriue with the Lord
by our prayers, and let him not goe vntill he haue heard vs,
in that which we aske of him in this afflicted time. Let our
prayers be now as the ſhowers of the raine, if the firſt ſhowre
faileth of watering the earth ſufficiently: the ſecond, the third
or the fourth, wil fulfill the thirſt thereof. Let vs be like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the widow, <hi>Luk. 18.</hi> and our importunitie will draw him
vnto audience: but yet let vs hold a better opinion of the
iudge of the world, then of a common vulgar friend. It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
his eares to heare our redoubled obſecrations, and he
ſuſpendeth our deſires in expectation, that we ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate
to craue.<note place="margin">Hbak. 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> The bodily Phyſitians cannot away
with the importunate patient: but God, King <hi>Dauids</hi> Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian,
loueth the importunate prayer, and more acceptable is
to him the ende of our prayer then the beginning. I would
the children of light were as wiſe in their generation, as the
wodden Prieſts, <hi>1. Reg. 18.</hi> who cried long to <hi>Baal:</hi> yea cut
themſelues with kniues that they might be heard: and what
ought not wee then doo to obtaine our ſuite? Let nothing
then mooue vs to returne: but as the King of the Philiſtines,
<hi>1. Sam 6.</hi> though they had Calues at home, yet they kept
the ſtraight way to <hi>Bethſhemeſh,</hi> and held one path: turning
neither to the right, nor to the left hand; neither euer ſtood
ſtill, till they came into the field of <hi>Ioſuah.</hi> So in our going to
the name of <hi>Iehouah,</hi> the affection of our ſoules bearing the
Arke and coffer of our ſuites, though it hath worldly allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to draw it backe, as the Kine had Calues: yet let it in
the way to the houſe of God, as they to <hi>Bethſhemeſh,</hi> hold one
path of perſeuerance, turning neither to the right or left hand
with wandring cogitations, till it commeth into the field and
garden of God, and there let it remaine. Many hauing not
continued in the Countrey, in their haſtie returning are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
ſicke,<note place="margin">The third part containing the houſhold ſtuffe which we muſt carrie vnto that place.</note> and died: So many hauing not continued in this
ſtrong bulwarke, haue endangered both body and ſoule.
And thus much hitherto of the ſecond part.</p>
            <p>There followeth now the third and the laſt, which ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
vnto vs the houſhold-ſtuffe which we muſt carrie with
<pb facs="tcp:21216:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vs thither noted in the word <hi>(Righteous.)</hi> As they which go in
the country in the time of plague, carie with them their houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold-ſtuffe,
their furniture, &amp; thoſe things which are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
for their bodies, and as <hi>Noah</hi> entring the arke carried with
him neceſſaries; ſo likwiſe in our going to this place, we muſt
carrie with vs thoſe things which are neceſſarie for our ſoules,
that we may be receiued by the Lord of that ſoyle, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which wee can not goe thither. There are fiue peeces of
ſpiritual houſhold-ſtuffe which are neceſſary for vs, noted in
the word <hi>Righteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt is <hi>Repentance</hi> and holines of life,<note place="margin">1. Repentance.</note> for he that is
righteous giueth himſelfe to righteouſnes. And this furniture
carried with him <hi>Dauid, 2. Sam. 24. 11.</hi> As they which goe in
the countrey haue their reaſons why they carrie with them
ſuch and ſuch neceſſaries: So giue me leaue in the opening of
this furniture, to ſhew you alſo the reaſons which muſt moue
vs to carie them with vs.<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2 19.</note> As for this firſt, the firſt reaſon is, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
preſcription of the ſpirituall Phiſitions, it is the Apoſtles
precept: Let euery one that calleth on the name of Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from iniquitie. The ſecond is, that we may be receiued,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
for the righteous Lord, loueth righteouſneſſe: his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
doeth behold the iuſt. <hi>Pſal. 11. 7.</hi> His eies are vpon the
righteous, and his eares open to their crye, but his face is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them that doe euill, to cut off their remembrance from
the earth, <hi>Pſal. 34. 15. 16.</hi> If I regarde wickednes in my heart
ſaith <hi>Dauid,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 66. 18.</note> the Lord will not heare me. For as <hi>Salomon</hi> teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
the Lord is farre off from the wicked, but he heareth the
prayer of the righteous. <hi>Prou. 15. 29.</hi> Drawe therefore neere
to God, and he will drawe neere to you: cleanſe your handes
ye ſinners,<note place="margin">Prou. 28. 9.</note> and purge your hearts ye wauering minded. <hi>Iam.
4. 8. 9.</hi> The third is, that the bodily plague may ceaſe, for how <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
dare we approach vnto the Lord, to craue that it might be
remooued, and yet carie with vs the inward cauſe thereof: let
the Phyſitions maxime heere preuaile, remooue the cauſe,
that the effect may ceaſe. Let vs not as the ſonnes of <hi>Iacob,</hi>
bring into the preſence of our father,<note place="margin">Pſal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 59.</note> the garment of <hi>Ioſeph</hi>
which we our ſelues haue beblooded. As <hi>Aaron</hi> could not
<pb facs="tcp:21216:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
come before the Lord before he was waſhed, ſo let vs not goe
vnto him before we haue cleanſed our ſelues from infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the ſoule. And as <hi>Iacob Gen. 43.</hi> exhorted his ſonnes,
when they were going to <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> carrie with you the beſt
fruites of the land and giue them him: ſo let vs in our going to
to the true <hi>Ioſeph</hi> Ieſus Chriſt, carrie with vs the beſt fruites of
our hearts to offer vp the ſacrifice of our prayers, our corrupt
affections, as <hi>Abraham</hi> left behinde him at the foote of the hill
his aſſes I conclude this firſt point with the ſaying of <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,</hi>
as in a garland, it is not enough that the flowers bee
pure and cleane, but the hand alſo which handleth them: ſo it
is not ſufficient that the words of our prayers be holy, but the
heart alſo which conceiueth them.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond piece of houſhold-ſtuffe is <hi>(Faith)</hi> for the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
is alſo hee that beleeueth in Chriſt,<note place="margin">Faith.</note> and is righteous
through the righteouſnes of Chriſt the righteous. This furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
carried <hi>Dauid</hi> with him,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 24.</note> for as he had a deſire of health
and remiſſion of his ſinne, ſo he had alſo a ſtedfaſt faith and
confidence that it ſhould be forgiuen him. This perſuaſion of
deliuerance, and hope of obtaining, we muſt haue with vs
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> entertaining it in our hearts. The reaſons, are firſt the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of the ſpiritual Phiſitions, it is the Apoſtles precept,
<hi>Iam 1. 6. Let him aske in faith and wauer not.</hi> And in the fourth
to the <hi>Hebr. 16.</hi> that we ſhould goe boldely to the throne of
grace: drawing neere vnto him with a true heart in aſſurance
of faith, <hi>Heb. 10. 22.</hi> caſting not away that confidence which
hath great recompence of reward,<note place="margin">Ver. 35.</note> tis the counſaile of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Chriſt, <hi>Mar. 11. 24.</hi> Secondly, carrie it with thee, that thou
maiſt receiue that, for which thou goeſt vnto him faithfully.
<hi>Pſal 145. 18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> And whatſoeuer yee ſhall aske in prayer, if yee
beleeue ye ſhall receiue it. <hi>Math. 21. 22.</hi> Without this, there is
no going thither. <hi>Rom. 10. 14.</hi> But as righteouſnes and trueth
kiſſe each other, ſo muſt prayer and faith, which is the ground
of prayer: firſt beleeue, and then ſpeake, this was the order of
<hi>Dauid, Pſal. 116.</hi> this faith will make vs acceptable to the
Lord of that ſoile, and make vs finde fauour at his hands.
Faith is a beautifull queene, as highly fauored of the King of
<pb facs="tcp:21216:26"/>
Kings, as euer <hi>Eſther</hi> was of King <hi>Aſſuerus:</hi> ſhe ſhall not be
ſtayed without at the gate, but with an humble preſumption,
may approach into the inner court, and ſhall receiue her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt:
for if we ſhall receiue a Kingdome, <hi>Luc. 12.</hi> how much
more that which is leſſe, being asked by faith? come not then
without this aduocate. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> in his treatiſe <hi>de Idol vanit,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
(ſpeaking how hee and his brethren did much good in
the viſitation of the ſicke) <hi>prout fides patientis adiuuat, aut gratia
curantis aſpirat,</hi> that he proſpered according as they and the
patient had faith to ſpeake vnto God: the greateſt enemie to
the efficacie of our prayer is diſtruſtfulnes. And therefore
God forbid ſaith <hi>Auguſtine</hi> that what we deſire God to doe
for vs with our mouthes we ſhould deny him to be able to doe
in our hearts.<note place="margin">In Hipolito.</note> A heathen man <hi>Seneca</hi> could ſay, he that asketh
fearefully and doubtfully, teacheth him to denie of whom he
asketh: and men doubting they ſhall not obtaine, make God
vnwilling to heare them. As vnbeleefe did ſhut the doore vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Iewes that ſome of them enter not into <hi>Canaan,</hi> a tipe of
heauenly Ieruſalem; ſo diſtruſtfulnes is able to ſhut our praier
out of that heauenly <hi>Canaan.</hi> And therefore as <hi>Iacob</hi> going
to his father <hi>Iſaac,</hi> to receiue the bleſſing, put on the garment
of his eldeſt brother, ſo let vs going to our heauenly father to
obtaine our requeſt, be cloathed with faith through the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e
of our eldeſt brother Ieſus Chriſt. Further, this
confidence giueth vs entrie into that place. Open the gates
ſaith the prophet, <hi>Eſ. 26. 2.</hi> that the righteous nation which
keepeth faith, may enter in. Faith is as a key that openeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs the gates of the cittie. Thirdly, this furniture is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
for the feete which muſt beare vs thither, that they may be
firme, ſtedfaſt, and faile vs not in the way: the moiſture and
iuice whereby the ſpiritual feet of our prayers are nouriſhed,
is faith. By faith yee ſtand, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>2. Cor. 1.</hi> It is the
roote that beareth vs, the legges and ſupporters, and the
ſtrong men that hold vs vp that we fall not. As the Doues
neſt is the cleftes of rockes that cannot be aſſaulted, ſo faith
reſteth it ſelfe in the wounds of Chriſt, it caſteth an anchor in
knowledge of the true God, and ſtandeth as firme, as mount
<pb facs="tcp:21216:27"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Sion that cannot be remooued. Fourthly, we muſt carrie it
with vs, that we may liue: why doe wee with our houſhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuffe
goe into the Countrey, but becauſe we are deſirous of
life? If in the going to the name of <hi>Iehouah</hi> for remiſsion of
ſinne and ſpirituall life, and for the remoouing of the effect
of ſinne the bodily contagion, we are deſirous of it, we muſt
not forget this furniture, for by Faith we liue, <hi>Abac. 2. It is
the life of the ſoule, and the ſoule and ſpirit of the new man.</hi> Wee
may haue a name that wee liue, but indeede wee are dead to
God-ward, if wee beleeue not: doubting then neither of
might, mercie, or of his promiſe, becauſe they are paſſed by
couenant, oath, before vnmooueable witneſſes, the beſt in
heauen, and the beſt in earth, and becauſe they are ſigned
with the finger of the holy Ghoſt, and ſealed with the blood
of his annoynted and beloued, let vs with a holy confidence
runne to this place in this afflicted time of the contagion, that
we may receiue mercie.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third peece neceſſarie for our voyage, is <hi>(Humilitie)</hi>
which excludeth all opinion of our owne worthineſſe and

               <hi>Dauid</hi> carried his furniture with him, yea

out of his bodily proſtrating of himſelfe in ſacke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath
with the Elders of Iſrael, <hi>1. Chron. 21.</hi> Herein let vs in

It was the counſel that <hi>Aeſope</hi> gaue to <hi>Solon,</hi> enquiring what

who are but ſmoake and vanitie, wee ſpeake with humilitie
much more doth the preſence of the moſt high God require
it. Secondly, the conſideration of our owne perſons which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
doe goe thither: the conſcience of our owne vnworthineſſe,
and deformitie of ſinne wherwith we are ſpotted: let vs then
with <hi>Abraham</hi> ſpeaking to the Lord,<note place="margin">Gene. 18.</note> confeſſe that we are but

Chriſtians, learne of Chriſt to pray, who although there was
no vnworthineſſe in him, yet hee kneeled, fell vpon the
ground, the footeſtoole of his owne Maieſtie, and lay vpon
his face, which neuer Angel beheld without reuerence. The
third is, that our comming to him, may bee acceptable, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
that we may receiue the health we ſue for. To him looketh
the Lord, that is poore, and of a contrite ſpirit, <hi>Eſa 66. 2.</hi>
which hee will not deſpiſe, <hi>Pſal. 51. 17.</hi> for hee is neere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

humble? <hi>1. Pet. 5.</hi> Humilitie is both grace it ſelfe, and a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
to comprehend other graces: and ſhee emptying her ſelfe
by a modeſt eſtimation of her owne gifts, is filled againe by
the Lord. Let vs now beloued as it were ſtriue by humilitie
with the Lord, according to the policie of <hi>Iacob:</hi> Let vs
winne by yeelding, and the lower wee ſtoupe towards the
ground, the more aduantage wee ſhall get to obtaine. The
Lord to whom we goe, if this humilitie bee in vs, will both
<pb facs="tcp:21216:28"/>
dwell with vs and in vs. O Lord, ſaith <hi>Auſtine,</hi> how high art
thou, and yet the humble of heart, are thine houſes to dwell
in: I he proude Phariſie, <hi>Luk. 18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> went vnto the Lord with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his furniture, praying with pride and with a skornefull
demonſtration, and therefore returned not iuſtified as the
Publican. O that we had not for the moſt part of vs all ſuch
Phariſaicall eye-browes, whether wee talke with God or

               <hi>Feare not, for from the firſt day that thou
dideſt humble thy ſelfe before thy God, thy words were heard.</hi>
Let vs therefore vſe to conclude this point: this humble ſtile
of <hi>Dauid,</hi> it hath beene the ſtile of a King: and although it
ſeemeth inglorious, yet it hath beene the ſtile of the glorious
Saints of God: it will giue vs the honour of Saints, and raiſe
vs from the duſt, ſet vs vpon the thrones, and if it pleaſe the
Lord to take vs away by the plague, it will place vs with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels:
let vs not then brethren forget it, that the anger of the
Lord may ceaſe, and that with ioy hereafter wee may ſing

let vs ſet him no time as the Diſciples did about the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> perſwade vs to bring it with vs, are three: the firſt is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of the ſpirituall Phyſitians of Chriſt, <hi>Luk. 21.</hi> and
in the prayer which he hath taught vs: of <hi>Dauid, Pſal 37. 7.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and of the reſt. The ſecond is, the Lords equitie in all his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
he gouerneth not by luſt, but by law: he draweth thee
not to obedience by a violent chaine of his vnchangeable
purpoſe, but by reaſon and iuſtice: eſteeme not his will in
the moderating of the world as immoderate: hee hath a will,
but not as inordinate Princes, who hauing the raines of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
giuen into their hands, doo many things inordinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
without law, reaſon, iuſtice, equitie: proclayming with
<hi>Nero,</hi> that they may doo all things, and that no bodie may
controll them. No, no, beloued, his will is alwayes holy, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
iuſt and equitable, although it ſeemeth vnto thee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third is the example of Chriſt; Chriſtians, the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God it ſelfe, in whom the Deitie dwelt bodily, was
content to forſake his wiſedome, and to be ordered and rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
by this ſquire of his Fathers will: <hi>Father, not my will, but
thine be fulfilled.</hi> This is then the ſpirituall furniture which we
muſt carrie with vs, if wee will goe to the name of <hi>Iehouah.</hi>
Prayer with theſe companions will returne laden with the
<pb facs="tcp:21216:29"/>
ſheaues of comfort and bliſſe from the plentifulleſt fieldes.
And by theſe it is manifeſted, that the righteous onely goe
to this place: the name of <hi>Iehouah</hi> is not like vnto the earthly
places, vnto which in the time of infection reſort both good
and bad. The vngodly may make a ſhew to goe vnto it, but
yet they can not come thither, for there is the ſpirit of prayer,
<hi>Zach. 12.</hi> which is giuen onely to them that bring with
them this ſpirituall furniture. As for weapons to ſafegarde
our ſelues, we neede none, for this houſhold-ſtuffe are ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall

            </p>

hath vſed this faithfull friend in the time of the plague, he
hath ſent it as an Embaſſadour into the court of heauen to

finde theſe good qualities: Firſt, <hi>Faithfulneſſe,</hi> for many haue

is a meſſenger of eſpeciall truſt, it wil trauaile with vs by day:
awake with vs by night: it will not forſake vs by land, by
water, in weale, in woe, liuing nor dying, it is our laſt friend
and indiſſolubleſt companion.<note place="margin">Quicke.</note> Secondly, wee deſire one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
quicke of ſpeede: Prayer is able in a minute to mount aboue
the Eagles of the skie, into the heauen of heauens, and is a
<pb facs="tcp:21216:30"/>
chariot of fire bearing vs aloft into the preſence of God to

vnknowne in the ſtilleſt ſilence of the night, till he come to
the ſecrets and chamber of the Lord, King <hi>Dauids</hi> Phiſition.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly,<note place="margin">Willing.</note> we ſeeke one who is willing, and is not afraid, (for
they are ſcarce to be found) prayer is ſuch a friend, he is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
to be with thee: neither the tediouſneſſe of the way, or

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, we are deſirous to haue one that can ſpeake lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
which the Phyſition can vnderſtand, if neede were to
ſend him thither, and who can prouide vs of neceſſaries, ſuch
one is prayer: for what language ſoeuer it ſpeaketh, the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of heauen can vnderſtand it.<note place="margin">Learned.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly,<note place="margin">A comforter.</note> one that is able to comfort vs in our diſtreſſe, ſuch a
comforter is praier, it is the life of the ſoule: if thou art per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
with ſuch greefe of heart, as neither wine (according
to the aduiſe of <hi>Salomon)</hi> nor ſtrong drink can bring eaſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,

in light or darknes, pleaſures or riches, kinsfolkes or
friends, wiſhing with <hi>Iob. 4.</hi> O that thou wouldeſt hide me in
the graue, and keepe me ſecret vntill thy wrath is paſt: yet
then this friend is our comfort, he will ſpeake for vs vnto the
Lord, King <hi>Dauids</hi> Phiſition, by this we may flie into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
of Gods mercies. If any then be afflicted amongſt you,
let him pray<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Iam. 5.</hi> The reaſon why we deſire a friend with
all theſe qualities, is that he might both aide, and prouide vs
with all neceſſaries: praier is a friend who is able to diſpatch
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> all our buſineſſe. Deſireſt thou a Phiſition in thy ſicknes to
cure thee, ſend this friend praier to King <hi>Dauids</hi> Phiſitian
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> dwelling in heauen, and he will bring him with him. If thou
needeſt phiſick to heale thee, and which is good for thy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,
ſend praier into heauen to fetch the hearbe of patience,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> which groweth not in our owne garden. If thou deſireſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries
for thy ſoule, ſend him to the Lord, he will fetch for
thee, all that thou wanteſt, the bread of life, that heauenly
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Manna, the blood of Chriſt; the waters of mercie. Needeſt
thou a comforter, ſend praier vnto the Lord, and he wil bring
<pb facs="tcp:21216:30"/>
with him the beſt comforter of the ſicke, the holy Ghoſt, it is
his name; <hi>Iohn. 14.</hi> he will not feare to come to thee, as often the
bodily Phiſitian. Laſtly, if we deſire our friends to come and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
viſite vs, ſend prayer for them, and they will come: God the
father, God the ſonne, God the holy Ghoſt. No friend then
better then prayer. There are ſome bad ſeruants of which we
muſt take heeede, and as in the time of plague there are ſome
bad ſeruants who robbe and bereaue the ſicke of that he hath:
ſo there are ſome wicked friends who will depriue vs of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
comforts,<note place="margin">1. Bad ſeruants.</note> if we be not ware of them. Firſt if we ſhould
vſe the aide of merits and ſend them vp, the ſtarres in heauen
would diſdaine it,<note place="margin">Merites.</note> that we which dwell at the footeſtoole of
God dare to preſume ſo farre,<note place="margin">Ephe. 6. 4.</note> when the pureſt creatures in
heauen are impure in his ſight.<note place="margin">Feare.</note> Secondly, if we ſend vp feare <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
and diſtruſtfulnes, the length of the way will tire them out,
they are as heauy and lumpiſh as gaddes of yron, they will
ſinke to the ground, before they come halfe way to the throne
of ſaluation.<note place="margin">Blaſphemies.</note> Thirdly, if we ſend vp blaſphemies and curſes, all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
the creatures betwixt heauen and earth will band themſelues
againſt vs. The Sunne and the Moone wil raine down blood,
the fire, hote burning coales, and the ayre thunderbolts vpon
our heades. And therefore let vs not vſe the ayde of theſe
three bad ſeruants. As prayer is a ſeruant to ayde the ſicke, ſo
it is a truſtie friend or ſeruant to keepe your houſen, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.

            <p>The pleaſure of it, may bee the third argument of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <note place="margin">Delectable</note>
this exerciſe is pleaſant and delectable. To ſpend
the time in the Countrey, diuers vſe pleaſant and delectable
exerciſe: this is both acceptable to God, &amp; pleaſant to man:
<pb facs="tcp:21216:32"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to God, for the ſweete odours of our prayers aſcend into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,<note place="margin">To God.</note>
               <hi>Apoc. 8.</hi> And as the ſent of incenſe and Odoriferus things
is pleaſant to the noſtrels of mortall man: So the prayer of
the righteous, ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> is pleaſant to the immortall
God. It is not then, the lamentation of men, eiulation of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and children, mingling heauen and earth together with
a confuſion of out-cries, that is acceptable to God, and which
can enforce him to giue vs audience: but it is humble prayer,
the voyce of repentance: which as <hi>Ieſus Syrach</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Eccl.
35. 16.</hi> ſhall bee accepted with fauour, and reach vnto the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> cloudes. Secondly to vs all that our heart deſireth is in this
exerciſe.<note place="margin">To man.</note> Some being in the Countrey, ſpend their time in
diſcourſes, prayer is a diſcourſe with our beloued. If it was a
pleaſure to <hi>Iacob</hi> to ſpeake vnto <hi>Rachel,</hi> and to <hi>Ionathan</hi> with
<hi>Dauid:</hi> O what a recreation is it for our ſoules that they may
familiarly ſpeake with him, whoſe loue vnto vs is better then
gold or pearle. If we delight to ſpeake languages, by prayer
wee may ſpeake the excellenteſt language which hath euer
beene, the language of Canaan: let vs not feare to diſcourſe
with the Lord by our prayers, for hee is not like vnto the
ſpruce and finical ſonnes of men: feare not, ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi>
he ſeeketh not at thy hands painted eloquence, an angelicall
tongue, filed phraſes: but beholdeth only the beautie of thy
ſoule. Others take their pleaſure while they are in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
to ride vp and downe in their Coches and Chariots, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
carried therein betwixt heauen and earth. Let prayer bee
your Coache beloued: it is as one ſaith, as a Chariot of fire,
bearing vs aloft in the preſence of God, able to mount vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
the Eagles of the skie to ſeeke the Lords aſſiſtance. In
the time of plague, there is appointed a Waggon or Coache
to carrie the ſicke to the Peſt-houſe, and there to be healed:
there is no better Chariot to carrie our ſoules vnto the houſe
of heauen to bee healed by that heauenly Phyſitian, then
humble prayer. Some delight to goe vp and downe and ſee
their friends; our beſt friends at this time, and at all times who
can do vs the moſt good: are God the Father, the Sonne and
the holy Ghoſt: let vs viſite them therefore continually by
<pb facs="tcp:21216:32"/>
our prayers. Others in writing letters, what is prayer elſe,
but as it were a letter ſent to God in which wee declare our
neede: and as a letter is an amiable diſcourſe and conference
of one friend with another, as if they were both preſent: So is
our prayer, as a friendly letter or diſcourſe of vs which are
abſent from home: with our beſt friend the Lord, as if wee
were preſent with him in heauen. Send this letter, and letter
vpon letter: yee that are now exiled, ſhew vnto the Lord
your neede: pray vnto him that hee will bring you home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and remooue that in his mercie which keepeth you
backe. Laſtly, ſome in running of Races, or in Hunting; but
yee beloued in this afflicted time, runne the way of Gods
Commandements: as <hi>Dauid, Pſal. 119.</hi> runne to the name of
<hi>Iehouah</hi> with the righteous, <hi>Prou 18.</hi> runne the race which is
ſet before you, and that with patience, looking vnto Chriſt
Ieſus, <hi>Hebr. 12. 1.</hi> and ſo runne that yee may obtaine that
which you ſue for. Hunt not after the pleaſures of this life,
but after the liuing God: and as the Hart brayeth for the ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
of waters, ſo let your ſoules pant after the liuing God,
<hi>Pſal. 42. 1.</hi> That the Lords Hunter, <hi>Pſal. 91.</hi> hunt vs not, but
that the Lord may deliuer vs from the ſnare of the Hunter,
and from the noyſome peſtilence, <hi>Pſal. 91. 3.</hi> Vſe therefore
this comfortable exerciſe: the childe is neuer better but when
it is in his fathers and mothers lap: So ſhal you neuer be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but when by prayer you creepe as it were in your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
Fathers boſome: it will kindle your loue toward him,
as the loue of louers is kindled, the more they come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
and if yee remaine there this Winter, feruent prayer
will bee in ſteade of fire, to kindle in your hearts the loue of
God.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the profit of this exerciſe commendeth it much,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
it is not onely delectable,<note place="margin">Profitable.</note> but alſo profitable. Some which
are in the Countrey at this time ſpend their time I doo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
profitably, riding vp and downe to buy commodities <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
againſt the future:<note place="margin">To vs.</note> but prayer is a farre profitabler exerciſe
for this time, for it is not onely profitable to our ſelues, but
alſo vnto others: yea, to the whole Realme. And as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
<pb facs="tcp:21216:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſpeaketh of Godlines, that it is profitable for al things;
ſo I may ſay of prayer, that it can obtaine any thing: profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for vs in two reſpects: Firſt, to obtaine that we haue not:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Secondly, to keepe that we haue obtained. Firſt, if thou lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt
knowledge and wiſedome, prayer is the meanes to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
it, <hi>Iam. 1.</hi> If thy vnderſtanding bee darke, pray with
<hi>Dauid, Pſal. 119. Open mine eyes O Lord, that I may ſee the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries
of thy Law.</hi> If thou lackeſt zeale, pray with <hi>Dauid, Pſal.
119. Lord incline my heart vnto thy law, &amp;c.</hi> And becauſe this
world is a deſart where we may eaſily erre, pray with <hi>Dauid,
Pſal. 50. Leade me in thy pathes, &amp;c.</hi> If our ſoules be infected
with the plague of vanitie and couetouſneſſe, the meanes to
remooue it, is prayer, <hi>Pſal 119. O Lord remooue farre from me
vanitie, and encline not my heart to couetouſneſſe.</hi> The meanes
to obtaine a contented minde, is alſo prayer, <hi>Prou 30. Pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
nor riches giue me not, &amp;c.</hi> If thou deſireſt to thinke vpon
thy mortalitie, by the ſubiect whic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> now is preſented to thee,
pray with <hi>Dauid, Pſa. 90. Teach vs O Lord to number our dayes,
that we may applie our hearts to wiſedome.</hi> If yee deſire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,
it is not your ſports or delightes, but your prayers that
muſt bring you backe.<note place="margin">2. Sam. 24.</note> If yee deſire the ceaſing of the plague,
it is your prayer that muſt remooue the cauſe, that the effect
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> may ceaſe. As prayer obtaineth, ſo it keepeth that you haue
already obtained: ſuch are not your exerciſes, which ye your
ſelues haue inuented O ſonnes of <hi>Adam:</hi> for by them you
often looſe that which you had purchaſed ryotouſly (which
<hi>Alexander</hi> blamed in his friends) waſting and conſuming
your whole abilitie. There is another thing which ought to
perſwade you to this exerciſe:<note place="margin">2. To others.</note> which is, that it is profitable
to others: prayer doeth more good then Almes: for by our
Almes we can helpe but a fewe; but by our prayers wee can
helpe thouſands and thouſands: yea thoſe which are farre off.
Prayers, are the almes of the rich as well as of the poore: for
<hi>Pharao</hi> did as well begge for prayers, as poore <hi>Lazarus</hi> for
crummes. Yee rich men that are in the Countrey, beſtowe
theſe almes vpon the poore, as well as the almes of your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:
and in this afflicted time, ſeeke more to profite the whole
<pb facs="tcp:21216:33"/>
Realme by your prayers, then by your commodities. I ende
this point with the ſaying of <hi>Auguſtine: Plus profeci orando qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
legendo,</hi> I haue more profited by praying, then by reading.</p>
            <p>Fiftly,<note place="margin">5. To ſtrengthen vs.</note> this exerciſe is commendable, becauſe it is able to
to ſtrengthen vs. Some in the Countrey doo ſpend their time
in exerciſes, by which they may maintaine their health, and
ſtrengthen their bodies, that they may bee able to doo any
thing: the exerciſe of prayer is good to make vs recouer the
health of our ſoules, which was waxen weake: as this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
plague, and your preſent exile both doo witneſſe. Yea,
it is able to make vs doo admirable things. Was it euer heard
that mightie Potentates, as there haue beene many: <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
the great, <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> and the reſt could make the Sunne
or the Moone to ſtand ſtill in the firmament? And yet this
hath done the prayer of <hi>Ioſua.</hi> Haue there euer beene any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
ſo great and mightie, which could make the earth to
tremble vnder their feete? No beloued: the mightie armie of
<hi>Xerxes</hi> could not doo it, and yet this hath done the prayer of
the Apoſtles, <hi>Act. 4.</hi> Who hath euer heard that it hath beene
poſſible to mortall man, to raiſe the dead and to giue life to
the deceaſed? The Phyſitians doo acknowledge their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note>
and yet this hath done the prayer of <hi>Elizaeur.</hi> As the
Apoſtle then in the commendation of faith, rehearſeth the
wonders which they haue wrought by faith: So it may bee
ſaid of prayer which is done in faith: by prayer <hi>Moſes</hi> diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the red ſea: by prayer <hi>Ioſua</hi> beat down thewals of <hi>Iericho:</hi>
by prayer <hi>Sidrach</hi> and <hi>Abednago</hi> quenched the fire: <hi>Daniel</hi>
ſtopped the Lyons greedie and deuouring throates: the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
opened the priſons and brake their bands. And I
will yet adde one thing, by prayer brethren you ſhall be able
to ouercome him, who is inuincible. The Lord hath beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
and taken in your Citie by his deſtroying Angel, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
meanes to reſiſt him, and to make him retire, are your
humble prayers: O the admirable force of prayer, which
ouercommeth him who ouercommeth al things! I may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
the prayers of the righteous to the haires of <hi>Sampſon:</hi> as
long as his head was adorned and couered with them, hee
<pb facs="tcp:21216:34"/>
was in a maner inuincible, hee brake the cordes and roapes
wherewith he was bound: his ſtrength lying in his haire; but
being ſhauen, his ſtrength went from him, he waxed weake
and like other men. All your ſtrength beloued lieth in your
prayer, as long as you exerciſe your ſelues therein, you ſhall
be able to reſiſt, I ſay not the tyrants &amp; the diuel, but the Lords
Angel himſelfe. You haue another enemie, the which to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt,
it is neceſſarie that you learne to handle the ſword of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer,
this enemie is cruell, malicious, mightie, ſubtile and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious,
his name bewrayeth his nature; Sathan by name,
who is not onely in the citie, but followeth you in the country
(for as a deuouring lion he compaſſeth the earth) and there
he ſeeketh to make you forget the Lord, and the affliction of
<hi>Ioſeph:</hi> to ſticke to the creature, and forget the creator; to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
this enemie and his fierie darts, let this be your conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
exerciſe: Imitate the induſtrious wraſtlers, who to caſt
downe another, firſt fall downe themſelues: ſo to ouerthrow
this enemie who ſeeketh in the countrey to ouerthrow you,
caſt downe your ſelues by humble prayer and faſting, that in
that place you may triumph ouer him who thought to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
ouer you. To end beloued, to you all I ſpeake togither,
you that are in the cittie, enter this Arke: you that are caſt
downe vpon your beddes, vſe the aide of this friend: you that
are departed, let this be your paſtime, that we altogether may
bee preſerued from the deluge, and the waters may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
more and more, till they bee dried vp, that beeing
decreaſed wee may offer the ſacrifice of thankeſgiuing; as
<hi>Noah</hi> offered vnto the Lord after the flood. But let vs
not bee like vnto the ſea-ſicke, who onely are weake, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and crie as long as they are in the tempeſt, and when
they begin to ſmell the ayre, and are gone out of the ſhip, they
forget both their ſicknes and their deliuerance.<note place="margin">Gene. 28.</note> But rather as
<hi>Iacob</hi> (ye that are departed) flying to heauen, the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of his countrey being ſweete, made an excellent vow
and prayer, that if he came againe to his fathers houſe in ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
the Lord ſhould be his God, and that he would giue vnto
the Lord the tenth of all he had: ſo likewiſe ye that are depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="tcp:21216:34"/>
from your mother citie, as <hi>Iacob</hi> from his fathers houſe,
the remembrance thereof being ſweete to you, as I know it is,
make the vow and prayer of <hi>Iacob,</hi> that when the Lord bring
you home againe in ſafetie, that he ſhall be your God, and
that ye will ſerue him with more zeale and feruencie then ye
haue done before:<note place="margin">2. Pet. 3. 17. 18.</note> further, that ye will (if not the tenth) yet
ſome part of your goods, beſtow vpon the Lord in his poore
members. Let the Apoſtles words be the concluſion,
Ye therfore beloued, ſeeing ye know theſe things
before, beware leſt ye be alſo plucked away
with the errour of the wicked, but grow
in grace, and in the knowledge of
our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt,
to him be glory both now
and for euermore,
Amen.</p>
