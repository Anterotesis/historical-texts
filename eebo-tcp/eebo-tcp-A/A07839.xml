         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT honourable Lord, IOHN, Earle of <hi>Marre.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THere are two things discoursed of in this Treatise, which are of speciall consequence to this earthly life of man: the one is <hi>Prosperitie;</hi> the other is <hi>Righteousnesse.</hi> The first dependeth vpon Goods outward and bodily: the other vpon the Goodnesse &amp; vertues of the minde. Where these concurre, there is the liueliest paterne which this nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world affoordeth, of true <hi>Felicitie:</hi> and these two, like children of one fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, doesweetly embrace and kisse one another. <hi>1. Prosperitie</hi> furthereth <hi>Righteousnesse:</hi> for, a man that is no way streightened or disturbed, is the more free and comfortable to the seruice of God. And <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth <hi>Prosperity:</hi> for <hi>They which seeke</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psal. 34. 10.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:25541:3"/>
               <hi>the Lord, shall want nothing that is good. 2.</hi> Againe, <hi>Prosperitie</hi> beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth <hi>Righteousnesse:</hi> for a streight &amp; right-vp tree, the taller it groweth, the more comely it is. And <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> beautifieth <hi>Prosperitie:</hi> for <hi>Pleasure is not comely for a foole:</hi> no, <hi>Nemesis</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pro. 19. 10.</note> disdaineth the growing vp of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie. 3. Thirdly, <hi>Prosperitie</hi> perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth <hi>Righteousnesse:</hi> for how shall he minister iustice, that beareth no office? or shew mercie, that wanteth abilitie? or giue comfort, that is himselfe distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed? And <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> perfecteth <hi>Prosperitie:</hi> for <hi>What shall it profit</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Matth. 16. 26.</note> 
               <hi>a man, though he should winne the whole world, if he lose his own soule? 4.</hi> Lastly, there is no true <hi>Prosperitie</hi> without <hi>Righteousnesse:</hi> for, to liue in sinne, is with the Paganes <hi>To sit in darknesse, yea in the region and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Matth. 4. 16.</note> 
               <hi>of death.</hi> And where <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> is, there is true <hi>Prosperitie:</hi> for <hi>Godlines hath the promise of the life</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 8.</note> 
               <hi>present, and of that which is to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:25541:3"/>
Both of these (through Gods speciall mercie) doe accompanie your Lordship. <hi>Prosperous</hi> you are in your noble de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent, your large reuenues, your loue in your countrey, your successe in affaires, &amp; your speciall fauour with your Prince and ours. <hi>Righteous</hi> you are: not as free from sinne and infirmities, (so I should both flatter and blaspheme) but as redeemed from sinne by <hi>Christ</hi> with his blood, and iustified by the same <hi>Christ</hi> in his resurrection, and washed by the Spirit of <hi>Christ</hi> in the lauer of regeneration. To all which, your holy life and sincere loue to the Gospel, giue abundant testimony.</p>
            <p>Let it not therefore seeme strange vnto your Honor, if I (who long ago be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held and obserued your holinesse and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion) doe thus congratulate vnto you the continuance and daily increase of honor and reputation: for this my text teacheth me <hi>To reioice in the Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the righteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It pleased your L. not onely to know
<pb facs="tcp:25541:4"/>
me in <hi>Norwich</hi> almost twentie yeeres agoe, and to be there an Auditor of my Ministery; but also of your bounty of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to call me to your table, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of your humilitie to visit my lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging. If now you vouchsafe to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge me in <hi>London</hi> after so many yeres labours, and almost all my spirits spent in the seruice of the Church: I shall haue much more cause to reioice in your <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie,</hi> who in this your heigth, giue me in my declining &amp; languishing time some reputation with the <hi>Righteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The God of heauen and earth grant grace vnto your Honor, so to imploy this <hi>Prosperitie</hi> of yours to the furthering, countenancing &amp; perfecting of <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse:</hi> as your <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> may further, beautifie and perfect your <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity</hi> here &amp; in the heauens, through Iesus Christ our Lord.</p>

But he specifieth the Citie by name; first, because cities are the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall parts of a countrey, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly conteine vnder their iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction the neighbour villages. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, because <hi>Cities</hi> are the seats of great men and great offices: so as if a good man be preferred to dignitie, they do soonest espie it, yea and soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest feele the benefit of it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue the first and chiefest cause

to reioice therein.

to see this so often and vsually fall out in practise: for there are many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons inducing thereunto. 1. As first, where good men prosper, there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly good causes, they thriue and prosper also: the glory of God is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced, the law of God is obserued, the kingdome of God is inlarged. When <hi>Hezekiah</hi> came to the crown of <hi>Iudah,</hi> 
                     <note n="g" place="margin">2. Reg. 18. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>He tooke away the high pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and brake the images, and cut downe the groues, and spoiled the brasen ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent:</hi> that is, He rooted out all idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous and superstitious worship. And the Ecclesiasticall Histories euerie where make relation, how when the holy Emperours <hi>Constantine, Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius, Iustinian</hi> and the rest of the same stampe sate in the throne of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then the true religion of <hi>Christ</hi> was authorised and dilated. Now, when others shall see that by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, office, or abilitie of good men, God is honoured, righteousnesse is
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:25541:16"/>
practised, <hi>Christ</hi> is enterteined: if they haue any loue of God or good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in themselues, they can not but reioice at a good mans prosperitie. 2. Secondly, the aduancement of the Righteous is a publike benefit: for they know right well, that <note n="h" place="margin">Plato. Non nobis solum nati.</note> 
                     <hi>they are not borne only for themselues:</hi> and that <note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 12. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>brotherly loue is required of them:</hi> and that <note n="k" place="margin">Arist. topic.</note> 
                     <hi>a good thing, the commoner it is, the better it is.</hi> And therefore they striue to liue, not wholly to their owne priuate profit and pleasure, but to the common vse and benefit of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. When <hi>Salomon</hi> was newly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uested in the kingdome of <hi>Israel,</hi> and the Lord offered to giue whatsoeuer he would aske: <note n="l" place="margin">1. Reg. 3. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>he asked not for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe long life, nor riches, nor auenge on his enemies</hi> (which notwithstanding were things of great consequence to his owne estate:) but <hi>he asked an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding heart,</hi> which might inable him to gouerne with peace and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,

to the publike good of the people of God. <note n="m" place="margin">Gen. 47. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>Ioseph</hi> being rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to authoritie in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> made not the peoples want a prey to gorge himselfe withall: but he applied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to feed the Commons in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and to enlarge the reuenues and soueraintie of the crowne. The Apostles in their office and function sought not their owne praise, nor ease, nor wealth: but the ioyning of others to Christ. <note n="n" place="margin">2. Cor. 12. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>Non vestra, sed vos: I seeke not yours but you,</hi> saith S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the Corinthians. In a word: <note n="o" place="margin">Menander.</note>

                     </gap>: <hi>An honess man is helpefull at euery turne.</hi> Now therefore, when men shall feele by experience, that the aduancement of honest persons, is as the setting vp of a common light for euery man to walke by: or as the digging of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon well, at which euery man may draw water: haue they not great, and iust and daily cause to reioice in such

Lastly, when Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous men are preferred, then others that loue Righteousnesse grow vp, by and vnder them: as when the Sunne riseth, the flowers open themselues. <note n="s" place="margin">Ester 8.</note> 
                     <hi>Mordecaes</hi> exaltation by <hi>Ahashue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosh,</hi> wrought the preseruation of the Iewes from a common slaughter. And the comming of our late Q. <hi>Elisabeth</hi> to the crowne, was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leasing of the Protestants out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and the recalling home of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men from beyond the seas, and the confirming of poore Christians
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:25541:18"/>
in religion. So that (to conclude this point) when it shalbe wayed and considered, that by the rising vp of godly and religious men, God is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon good is furthered, the wicked are abased, and those that feare God are comforted: vnlesse a man be composed with <hi>Heraclytus</hi> onely to beholde what is amisse, that he may doe nothing but weepe; or haue put vpon him the person of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie herselfe, <note n="t" place="margin">Vix<expan>

we can adde to our holy knowledge or practise by this: that there is, yea, and that there ought to be <hi>Ioy in the Prosperitie of the Righteous.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. First it teacheth vs to be well as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, that the <hi>Righteous,</hi> that is, men which feare God and walke vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, haue due right and interest in <hi>Prosperitie:</hi> that is, in the helpes, comforts, and dignities of this life.

For <note n="u" place="margin">Heb. 1. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Christ is made the heire of all things:</hi> and therefore no man can haue interest in any thing: who is not a <hi>Coheire</hi> and <hi>Fellow heire with Christ.</hi> Insomuch that when any branch of <hi>Prosperitie</hi> betideth a <hi>Righteous</hi> man, there befalleth nothing to him but

And therefore if common-wealths and churches were so conscionably and religiously care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as they ought to be in bestowing their dignities and offices vpon those to whom onely by right they belong and appertaine, then should none atteine vnto them, but such as gaue testimonie of their <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foremen.

These and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse others fearing lest in an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tino their euill might come to light: as when a man remooueth his house,

many a thing is pulled out, that laie hid, while he was setled, in some dark corner: they can not but in appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance onely reioice at this prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
