            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Our work in this <hi>Narrative,</hi> is to rectifie his <hi>errours.</hi> He hath led many from the <hi>truth,</hi> ſo farre as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes <hi>Duckenfeild Church</hi> (for ſaving that there is an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle of our brother <hi>Roots</hi> annexed, there is nothing els med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with in this <hi>Apologie)</hi> and our undertaking is to reduce them to the <hi>truth.</hi> Should we ſuffer all to paſſe for <hi>truth,</hi> which he publiſheth concerning us, wee ſhould betray the <hi>truth,</hi> and our own innocency.</p>
            <p>Theſe faults may be juſtly charged upon him from the way he takes of <hi>blazoning</hi> the ſuppoſed failings of all other men, that differ from him, though but in the moſt controverted, dim, and diſputable points; and inſtances may be given (if need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire) in paſſages that relate to us, and our Church.</p>
            <p>Firſt, He hath abroad in the Kingdome <hi>Factors</hi> that <hi>trade</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:61618:3"/>
for him in the good <hi>names,</hi> and <hi>reputations</hi> of precious men, and orderly walking <hi>Churches,</hi> (who are not inferiour to the very chiefeſt of his <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> whether men, or Churches, <note place="margin">Gangrae. p. <hi>165.</hi>
               </note>though they be nothing) which they and he <hi>ſell</hi> over to be <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipated</hi> to <hi>infamy</hi> and <hi>diſgrace,</hi> for <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> crimes <hi>falſly</hi> ſuggeſted againſt them by <hi>himſelfe,</hi> and his <hi>creatures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>He takes reports</hi> (eſpecially flowing (as it is <note place="margin">Ibid.</note>ſaid) from godly perſons) <hi>upon truſt,</hi> and without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther examination, or inquiſition after the truth of them, iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues them abroad (with a great meaſure of confidence) into the Kingdome, as if ſo be, his ſuppoſed godly perſons, were arrived at an abſolute incapacitie of hearing an untruth, and when they have heard it, reporting it for a truth.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> Thirdly, He doth not conſider that that <hi>malignant</hi> ſpirit, that in all preceding ages of the Church hath <hi>bent</hi> mens tongues for lies, and ſlanders, againſt the <hi>Saints of the moſt high God,</hi> is moſt induſtriouſly active at this day to render thoſe men odious, whoſe Converſation imports <hi>ſtrictneſſe</hi> of a more then ordinary elevation in the <hi>wayes of God.</hi> So that it is no ſecuritie againſt the perill of falſe witneſſe-bearing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the people of God, to ſay, <hi>Such a godly man told me ſo;</hi> eſpecially when that that godly man was neither an eye, nor eare-witneſſe of the thing, nor hath trac'd the report upward from man to man, to the firſt reporter, who had need to be god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and an <hi>eye</hi> or <hi>eare-witneſſe</hi> of the thing. Our ſelves can ſpeake experimentally of the failings of divers <hi>Presbyterians</hi> formerly, whom we judged godly, that have taken up things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us by heare-ſay, for which they have ſeene cauſe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to be aſhamed; which we deſire rather to cover with the mantle of Brotherly love, then like flies to fall upon their ſores, and unneceſſarily to uncover their nakedneſſe, and rake in their infirmities, as Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> profeſſedly deales with us.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> runs the more deſperate adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb facs="tcp:61618:3"/>
to ſplit his reputation, and wound his Conſcience upon the Innocency of traduced Saints, becauſe he takes not onely the teſtimony of <hi>one</hi> ingaged <hi>party</hi> againſt the other, but even of the moſt <hi>precipitate, fiery</hi> ſpirits of that partie, the ſtrength of whoſe phanſie is enough to multiply a <hi>mole-hill</hi> of ſrailtie <note place="margin">3. <hi>Gangr. pag.</hi> 164. &amp; 165.</note>in the Saints, into a <hi>mountaine</hi> of obſtinary; yea, can make things that are not, appeare as though they were. And yet if the caſe were altered, Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> poſsibly would thinke the Teſtimonies of twenty of thoſe whom he calls <hi>Sectaries,</hi> incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent to take away the good name of one godly <hi>Presbyterian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fiſtly, The <hi>irregularitie</hi> of Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> his proceeding, is the more inexcuſable in this, That whereas there ſhould be two or three witneſſes for the confirmation of every matter, that is not of notorious Cognizance; and whereas <hi>the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Act. 25. 16.</note>
               <hi>ought to come face to face</hi> before the Accuſers: Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> publiſheth things of a private nature, upon the bare report of ſome one man, who is not in the capacitie of being a competent witneſſe in that matter whereof he is the relator. And ſo the good names of innocent, and ſome of them eminent perſons in the Kingdome, come to be blaſted by the miſpriſion of his <hi>ſupercilious,</hi> and unhallowed pen. Inſtance <hi>pag. 167.</hi> in what is related concerning two Gentlemen, perſons of great worth and honour.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, Adde to this, that the <hi>impatience</hi> of his zeale in defaming the ſervants of God, holds no correſpondence with principles of <hi>common prudence.</hi> For who but Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi> knowing that the <hi>Deacon</hi> of <hi>Duckingfeild,</hi> pag. <hi>68.</hi> was ſpeedily to be brought upon the Stage before the Civill power, would not have expected the iſſues of his aay of <hi>Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> rather then by an haſtie anticipation pre-judge (as in his Marginall note he doth) a perſon not yet heard nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Civill State. And indeed a little patience (comparatively to much) might have ſerved the turne. For
<pb facs="tcp:61618:4"/>
not long after Mr. <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> Bookſeller of <hi>Manche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> [who (as we coneeive) was both Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencer, and ſoone after the <hi>Deacons</hi> accuſer] had a faire, and free hearing, before the <hi>Committee</hi> againſt the <hi>Deacon.</hi> Yet the <hi>Committee</hi> found not him guiltie of the ſuppoſed <hi>knavery in couzening the State,</hi> the diſcovery whereof was prophecied in the Letter of <hi>Auguſt 3. 1646.</hi> publiſhed by Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> but diſmiſſed him from their Board without any Cenſure. Would Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> have thought it well, and if he ſhould have approved of it, yet wee could not have avoyded the regreet of our own Conſciences, when he being nominated for an <hi>Elder</hi> of <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> and accuſation upon accuſation from parts nearer and more remote, were brought in againſt him, if wee ſhould have writ up to <hi>London,</hi> that ere long Mr. <hi>Smiths knavery would be diſcovered,</hi> and ſuch a one as <hi>he,</hi> is a fit man to be an <hi>Elder</hi> in a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Church; even then when the Buſineſſe was depending, and unproved before the <hi>Triars?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seventhly, Nor can it well be omitted, (and as little juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied) <note place="margin">Pag. 167.</note>that from one Act (and that injuriouſly repreſented) a judgement ſhould be made upon a perſon; a Gentleman of worth muſt paſſe under the name of a great Zelot for <hi>Independents,</hi> from the evidence of one falſe Inſtance, which is given in to prove it. Would Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> be well pleaſed to have ſuch meaſure meaſured unto himſelfe againe, and that becauſe there are ſome ſlanderous reports publiſhed in Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> booke, therefore the whole booke is a booke of ſlanders?</p>
            <p>Eightly and laſtly, The <hi>ſcope</hi> and driſt of Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> is, to make the world beleeve, that ſuch as thoſe <hi>Sectaries</hi> (ſo by <note place="margin">The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal note. <hi>Pag.</hi> 68.</note>him called) are, whoſe <hi>perſonall failings</hi> he divulgeth, ſuch are (or at leaſt in time are like to be) all that are of that <hi>Sect</hi> reſpectively.

            <p>But how comes it about, that Mr. <hi>Eaton</hi> is the <hi>great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle</hi> in this place, who <hi>Pag.</hi> 164. is but a <hi>Paſtor or Teacher of the Church of Duckenfeild?</hi>

            <p>Now Apoſtolicall preaching of the Goſpell in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces up and downe the Countrey, is a <hi>good deſigne,</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally at this time, when there is ſuch want of preaching.

And as for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne of <hi>gathering Churches,</hi> (which is an <hi>Apoſtles</hi> worke) what one Church hath Mr. <hi>Eaton</hi> gathered? True it is, that he, with many others, wearied out with the long want of <hi>ſome</hi> of Gods Ordinances, and with corruption in <hi>other</hi> of Gods Ordinances, did at length (for their bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpirituall accommodation) joyne together in fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that they might injoy <hi>all</hi> Gods Ordinances.

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> As concerning the <hi>Deacon,</hi> we ſhall give a true relation of the carriage of that matter. M. <hi>Taylor</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> the laſt Summer, (in the beginning of the Moneth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> as he remembreth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had diſcourſe with a religious Gentleman (a friend of his, and of the <hi>Claſsicall</hi> way for matter of Judgement) concerning the different Church-ways, that are now matters of ſuch hot digladiation amongſt many in the Kingdome. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman by way of diſcourſe told him, that there were ſome in the Church of <hi>Duckenfeild,</hi> as bad as were to be found in the Pariſh Aſſemblies, and named <hi>Laurence O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen,</hi> a Deacon of our Church, and referred Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi> for further ſatisfaction to Mr. <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> Book-ſeller in <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> and to <hi>Thomas Hartley,</hi> for proofe of his diſhoneſt dealing with the State. Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi> at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne communicated this buſineſſe to the <hi>Elders</hi> of the Church, and in a ſhort time after wee both conferred with <hi>Thomas Hartley,</hi> and received from him a report that he was not ſatisfied that <hi>L. Owen</hi> had carried the matter well, and gave ſome Inſtances. Hereupon wee reſolved, (ſo ſoon as poſſibly we could get a convenient time,) to call <hi>Laurence Owen</hi> before us, and to require an account of him concerning his Negotiation for the State: and to deſire Mr. <hi>Smith, Thomas Hartley,</hi> and whomſoever els might fall under our Intelligence, as a perſon able to witneſſe any thing materiall concerning <hi>L. Owen</hi> his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, to give us the meeting. That if it might appeare that <hi>L. Owen</hi> had done any thing to the prejudice of the State, or peace of a good conſcience, wee might uſe our beſt endeavours to bring him to the ſight of his ſinne, and repentance for it, and alſo to make due ſatisfaction to the State.</p>
            <p>But many importune occaſions falling in, in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61618:7"/>
of time, deferred the execution of our determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations for a ſhort time, till a fit ſeaſon was by the good hand of providence opened unto us. But when wee were fully ripened by a univerſall conflux of all conce<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ring requiſites for the iſſuing of this buſineſſe, (which had not ſuffered the leaſt delay, but that we had probable, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing grounds of hope, that the charges againſt him were founded upon miſtakes in his accuſers) wee reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to bring it under examination, with a moſt requiſite and impartiall endeavour of diſcovering (ſo far as God ſhould help us) the whole truth. Now in this juncture of time, Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> had drawne up a charge, and brought it before the <hi>Committee of Lancaſhire,</hi> who upon a full, and impartiall hearing of the cauſe, did not find him guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the things charged upon him, and ſo diſmiſſed him from their Board, without any cenſure. And this was the iſſue of Mr. <hi>Smiths</hi> confidence that he ſhould ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily <note place="margin">

            <p>And though this buſineſſe iſſuing before the <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> according to our former (then preſent) apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, might have given reaſonable ſatisfaction to us in point of the <hi>Deacons innocency;</hi> yet becauſe wee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> was not herewithall ſatisfied, wee reſolved (as unforeſtalled in point of the innocency of the accuſed by any thing that paſſed before the <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> or fell otherwiſe under our obſervation,) to give Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> a full and faire hearing; that ſo if he could make any reall diſcovery, wee might improve it to the glory of God, the States ſatisfaction, and our Brothers ſpirituall good: and accordingly deſired Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> when he was ripe for the purpoſe, to let us underſtand. After ſome weekes paſt, Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> ſent <hi>a Declaration</hi> to Mr.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61618:8"/>
               <hi>Taylor,</hi> ſubſcribed with his own hand, and the hands of <hi>George Jackſon,</hi> and <hi>Tho: Hartley;</hi> containing divers char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges againſt <hi>L. O.</hi> Upon the receipt hereof, the Church aſſembled to faſt and pray before God, to ſeek aſſiſtance of grace on the behalfe of the Brother that was afreſh accuſed, that he might carry it candidly, and ſincerely in his Anſwer, as in the preſence of God, and be as ready to take ſhame to himſelfe, if any thing were juſtly charged, as to ſtand upon the defence of his innocency, in things wherein his Conſcience bore witneſſe to the integritie of his Actions: as alſo that the <hi>Elders</hi> might be inabled to conceive aright of things, and to make report of them accordingly to the <hi>Church.</hi> The Dutie being ended, the ſeverall <hi>Charges</hi> were drawne out of the <hi>Declaration</hi> [the moſt materiall of them being the ſame (as we have been informed) that were agitated formerly before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee] and <hi>L. O.</hi> required to make Anſwers to them: which accordingly he did. After we had thus heard both parties ſeverally, wee deſired to heare them joyntly, and that they might come <hi>face to face,</hi> for which purpoſe, Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi> writ a Letter to Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> and his two friends, deſiring them to give us the meeting at ſome convenient place, and to bring with them ſuch perſons as might give in evidence againſt <hi>L. O.</hi> concerning any thing contained in the <hi>Declaration,</hi> that might ſtand in need of further proofe. He alſo deſired that Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> of <hi>Aſhton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Angier</hi> of <hi>Denton</hi> (two godly, and grave Miniſters of the <hi>Claſsicall</hi> way) might be preſent as witneſſes of what paſſed on both ſides.</p>
            <p>This deſired meeting Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> and his two friends thought fit to decline for theſe two <hi>Reaſons,</hi> as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That matters of fact were laid downe with that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctneſſe,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61618:8"/>
and cleareneſſe in the Declaration, that they need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to adde no more words for the ſatisfaction of any ingenuous Reader.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, (and that by way of implication)</hi> that wee were not authorized to take their Examination upon Oath.</p>
            <p>To which M. <hi>Taylor</hi> in his Letter to them anſwered, That our deſigne was (according to our dutie) to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to bring our Brother to the ſight of his ſinne, and repentance for it, in caſe he ſhould prove guiltie, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſeverall charges contained in the <hi>Declaration,</hi> or any of them. That this we could not doe, except wee could convince him. That we could not convince him, and upon conviction proceed againſt him, but by the proofe of two witneſſes at the leaſt, ſince he confidently denied divers things contained in the <hi>Declaration,</hi> and in his Anſwer avoyded the dint, and ſcope of the reſt. That he deſired to have his <hi>accuſers come face to face,</hi> and that he might have libertie to Anſwer for himſelfe: and that this Juſtice neither they, (ſince they had laid a charge againſt him, nor wee (if wee would carry it righteouſly <note n="a" place="margin">Acts 25. 16. &amp; 26. 1.</note>) could deny him. That wee deſired to know whether they did joyntly atteſt all, and every of the miſcarriages charged in the <hi>Declaration,</hi> or ſeverally. If not all joyntly, but ſome ſeverally, then we deſired to know which of the particulars were atteſted by one onely witneſſe, and which by two or more, ſince we could not proceed upon a ſingle teſtimony, but muſt deſire further proofe. That <hi>L. O.</hi> had brought a Certificate <note n="b" place="margin">The ſame Certificate was ſince ſubſcribed by another godlyman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>under the hand of a man beyond exception faithfull, (who ſpake not by heareſay, but as an eye and eare witneſſe, point-blank, contrary to one maine thing charged in the <hi>Declaration,</hi> and alſo another man (that had great reaſon to know the ſtate of the buſineſſe to which he ſpake, atteſting that

which is contrary to the maine thing charged by them, as we ſhould give them fully to underſtand, if they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to give us the meeting. That there was alſo one thing mentioned in the <hi>Declaration</hi> in generall termes, <hi>viz. cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſummes of money received that were not given in in his accounts,</hi> but no <hi>particulars</hi> ſpecified, and we deſired that the <hi>particulars</hi> might be given in, and ſo atteſted by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or otherwiſe. That theſe things conſidered, they could not righteouſly deny us the meeting, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the diſtinctneſſe, and clearneſſe in matter of fact pretended to be in their <hi>Declaration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as for the ſecond, it was anſwered in Mr. <hi>Taylors</hi> Letter aforeſaid; That if they did not judge it unfit to give in their accuſation in their <hi>Declaration,</hi> though they did not look upon us as <hi>authorized to adminiſter an Oath to them;</hi> why might they not corroborate, and make out their accuſation before us (in things wherin there ſhould be need of further light,) though we were not in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie to adminiſter an Oath unto them? Theſe were the moſt material<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p ſſages in Mr. <hi>Taylors</hi> Letter.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Smiths</hi> Anſwer in the moſt conſiderable pertinent paſſages was; That he would have appeared before us, if he had believed us inveſted with any <hi>lawfull power by God</hi>

And foraſmuch as a meeting of them in the capacitie of Chriſtians, would be of equivolent conducency to the attainment of our end, wee ſhould as willingly meet them under that Notion, as in the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of a <hi>Presbytery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Anſwer being thus returned, we were in plenary expectation, that this buſineſſe would ſpeedily be iſſued one way or other. But though we condeſcended to meet Mr.</hi> Smith <hi>upon his own termes, yet in his Anſwer to</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:61618:10"/>
               <hi>Mr.</hi> Taylor, he totally <hi>(contrary to his own ingagement, and promiſe under his own hand,)</hi> refuſed to meet us, <hi>and not onely ſo,</hi> but expreſſed himſelfe reſolved to forbeare all further intercourſe with Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi> in writing about this matter. <hi>The</hi> reaſon <hi>alledged by him of his refuſall to meet us, was,</hi> That he was inhibited by the Committee of Accounts, who were reſolved to take the full examination of the buſineſſe themſelves, conceiving that our private debates, would no way advantage the publick, and might prejudice them in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. Aſſuring us that if we would have but a little pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, things would be diſcovered to our full ſatisfaction, out of the examination taken upon Oath.</p>
            <p>When we were thus deſerted by Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> and his two confederate friends, refuſing to tell us which of the charges were atteſted by one onely <hi>witneſſe,</hi> and which by two or more, or to give any <hi>particulars</hi> atteſted where the charge was <hi>generall,</hi> refuſing alſo to give us the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the making out of his charge, where it needed proofe, <hi>viz.</hi> in ſuch things, whereof he, and his two friends, were onely the relators, and accuſers, but could not poſſibly be the atteſtors or witneſſes: When wee were thus deſerted, (wee ſay) yet wee left no ſtone un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, further to informe our ſelves concerning this buſineſſe. And having notice that <hi>L. O.</hi> was to come to his <hi>Anſwer</hi> before the <hi>Committee</hi> of <hi>Accounts</hi> for <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> upon Tueſday the ſecond of <hi>Febr.</hi> 1646. (to our beſt remembrance) in <hi>Mancheſter:</hi> Wee both came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſent to the <hi>Gen lemen</hi> of that <hi>Committee,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire libertie that wee might ſit by and heare what paſſed that day for our further ſatisfaction. But this libertie was denied us by the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> at that time. After this Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi> having intelligence of the meeting of the <hi>Committee</hi> upon a Tueſday, came to <hi>Mancheſter</hi> to deſire
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61618:10"/>
a Copie of <hi>L. O.</hi> his charge, the better to enable them to diſcover the truth of this matter. But after he had come twice or thrice to the place where uſually they ſate, he was informed, that the Countrey people came not in, and ſo they would not ſit that day, and ſo loſt his labour at that time. After this he applied himſelfe to one of them particularly, expreſſing the deſire that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and his Brethren had to be throughly poſſeſſed of the ſtate of that buſineſſe, and that it would be a very great courteſie to us, if wee might but have a Copie of the <hi>Depoſitions.</hi> The Gentleman anſwered, that it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved at their Board, that <hi>L. O.</hi> ſhould not onely be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed <hi>Breviates,</hi> but alſo <hi>Copies at large of the Depoſitions,</hi> and there was but onely one thing undetermined, and that was, whether ſince all the <hi>Examinations</hi> were not taken, he ſhould have the <hi>Depoſitions</hi> piece meale, or the whole together. Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi> went away well ſatisfied in the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, and impartialitie of the <hi>Gentlemens</hi> proceedings in that matter. And ſo wee hope that in due time we ſhall enjoy the advantage of thoſe <hi>Depoſitions,</hi> to enable us to make a Judgement of the cauſe, and till then wee ſhall ſuſpend our thoughts and determinations about that matter. Onely this wee cannot but take notice of; That Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> after ſome <hi>Depoſitions</hi> were taken, before <hi>L.</hi>

Now we paſſe to the prodigious Story of the inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble DRUMME.</p>
            <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 164. there is the ſtory of a <hi>Drumme,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> makes a godly Miniſter of <hi>Cheſhire</hi> to be the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter</hi> of it to him, but his name is concealed; wee may not know him, yet we may aske Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> whether the Miniſter were an eye or eare witneſſe of it? If he were not, nor yet aſſerted ſo much to Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> how comes it that Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> ſaith in his Preface; <hi>For other Relations</hi> (alludeing to relations of fact) <hi>I have them from ſuch knowne godly Miniſters, and Chriſtians, being eare and eye witneſſe thereof.</hi> This will be found a monſtrous un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth in Mr. <hi>Edwards:</hi> However, becauſe there was no ſuch <hi>Miniſter,</hi> an <hi>eare,</hi> or <hi>eye-witneſſe</hi> of this matter, it will be found a <hi>loud lye</hi> betwixt them, upon which of them ſoever it will fall.</p>
            <p>But becauſe there is great Enquiry made in ſome parts of the Kingdome about this matter, wee thinke it neceſſary for the ſatisfaction of all that would be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the truth of it, to give a briefe <hi>relation</hi> of it, as it was at <hi>Duckenfeild,</hi> and afterwards to manifeſt what a <hi>Bundell</hi> of untruths were knit up together in the ſtory, as it is repreſented to the Kingdome. And for the truth of what we ſay, wee ſhall appeale to many <hi>impartiall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors,</hi> who (as they ſometimes repaire to the <hi>Chappell)</hi> ſo they were <hi>eare</hi> and <hi>eye-witneſſe</hi> of the whole matter that very day. Their Teſtimony (they being neither Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of our <hi>Church,</hi> nor of our opinion) wee hope will currantly paſſe with all rationall men. Which is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Upon one Lords day, while Mr. <hi>Eaton</hi> was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Duckenfeild</hi>-Chappell, there was the noyſe of Rapping or Striking upon one of the Pewes or Seates
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61618:13"/>
in the Chappell, and (they being made of thin Wain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcoate, and ſtanding hollow from any wall) the ſound was the greater, but continued not long. Upon the firſt hearing of it, Mr. <hi>Eaton</hi> turned his eare towards the place whence he conceived the ſound came, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had finiſhed the ſentence he was ſpeaking, he made a ſhort pauſe, as his manner hath often been to doe, and the noyſe immediately ceaſed; and he began againe to ſpeake, and ſo continued to the end, both of Prayer and Sermon, as at other times, without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther interruption. In the place, whence the noyſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, there was a dogge which lay under the Seate, and it was then, and ſtill is ſuppoſed, that the dogge in Scratching of his eare, ſtruck upon the Wainſcoate with his foote, which in ſo little a place as <hi>Duckenfeild</hi> Chappell, might well cauſe as great a noyſe, as was there heard: But before it could certainly be knowne what cauſed it, the noyſe was ended, and the dogge was immediately put forth from the ſeate upon it. In wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to the truth of this we ſet to our hands.</p>

In <hi>pag.</hi> 166. and 167. there is a <hi>Letter,</hi> in which the <hi>Sectaries</hi> are charged to have promoted a <hi>Petition</hi> for toleration, the members of <hi>Duckenfeild</hi> to have framed it, the <hi>ſubſcribers</hi> to be <hi>Seekers, Soule-ſleepers, Anabaptiſts,</hi> &amp;c.

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Truth it is, there was a <hi>Petition</hi> on foote, both in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> and <hi>Lancaſhire:</hi> The fierceneſſe of ſome <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi> in their <hi>Petitions</hi> in both Counties againſt their <hi>Brethren</hi> (who would have lived <hi>peaceably</hi> by them) was the cauſe of it.

Some <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi> were at the framing of it with <hi>Independants;</hi> many <hi>Presbyterians</hi> employed in the promoting of it.

In this <hi>Extract</hi> alſo ſome <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of <hi>noble Qualitie,</hi> are moſt unworthily and falſly charged; And though they be not nominated, yet being it is notoriouſly known who are intended, the injury is not the <hi>leſſe,</hi> but the <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> for they might vindicate themſelves from ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſions had they been nominally mentioned.</p>
            <p>The one of them is ſaid to be <hi>become a great Zealot for Independants,</hi> for no other reaſon, but becauſe he is not cauſleſly tranſported, with that rage and fury againſt them, as the <hi>Author</hi> of this <hi>Letter</hi> is, and many other of the <hi>Pre byterians</hi> are in that <hi>County;</hi> That <hi>he threatned any godly Miniſter to make their places too hot for denying their Pulpits to Mr. Eaton,</hi> is moſt calumniouſly aſſerted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſo honourable a perſon. The one of us was an <hi>eye</hi> and <hi>eare witneſſe,</hi> when this man (not a godly as it is ſaid) but an unworthy <hi>ſcandalous Miniſter</hi> behaved himſelfe inſolently and audaciouſly againſt this <hi>Gentleman;</hi> and yet he bore it with remarkable patience, onely told him <hi>his own unworthy intemperate offenſive carriage in his functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, might ere long be brought againſt him, to caſt him out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>other Gentleman</hi> is ſaid to have incouraged <hi>Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> diſcouraged and borne downe the Orthodox well affected <hi>Gentlemen</hi> and <hi>Miniſters,</hi> that they could never to this day, get any thing done againſt them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But this is a moſt ingratefull accuſation againſt ſo deſerving a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> who hath done his <hi>Countrey,</hi> and the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> ſuch noble ſervice, and it is full of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious ſlander.</p>
            <p>For, firſt; The perſons that he is ſaid to have incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, are knowne to be as <hi>godly and as Orthodox (Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency</hi> excepted, which in point of Oxthodoxneſſe is under doubtfull diſputation) <hi>as any other.</hi> And what hath his incouraging been, but his entreating them to take
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61618:15"/>
their Turnes in preaching with others: which ſervice al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the <hi>Parliament</hi> hath required from ſome of their judgement.</p>
            <p>Secondly, What Inſtance can be given of any one <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Gentleman,</hi> or <hi>Miniſter,</hi> that he hath diſcouraged and borne downe?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, When were there ever any attempts made, and ſet afoote by any of the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> or <hi>Miniſter</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch perſon, and he oppoſed them therein, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged himſelfe for the other party? if none of theſe, then is he unworthily dealt with. And let it be obſerved, that whereas there is an implication in his words of a forwardneſſe among the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> and <hi>Miniſters</hi> to <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe Independency,</hi> there is an untruth cloſely wrapped up in it; for no ſuch thing hath appeared from the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,</hi> nor generally from the <hi>Miniſters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is alſo conſiderable, how to uſher in, what (by way of defamation) he would have the world to take notice of concerning this <hi>Gentleman,</hi> he takes upon him to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the ſtate of <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> and therein his own horrid apprehenſions of the <hi>Independents,</hi> (for he inſtanceth onely in them) and he compares them (by way of impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation) to ſome <hi>hideous devouring Monſter,</hi> and all that are taken with them he reſembles to a <hi>miſerable prey;</hi> as if <hi>Independency</hi> were <hi>mortiferous</hi> and <hi>deadly</hi> to all the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracers of it, poyſonous and deſtructive to mens ſoules. It is of ſad conſideration to thinke unto what an unjudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſſe of mind, and to what <hi>moaſtrous conceptions</hi> men are left, through want of charity. And then to confirme what he had aſſerted of <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> he ſtrengthens it with a notorious untruth; <hi>There are</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>two or three In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Churches, ſet up by them already, and they are ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up two or three more;</hi> the latter part of this relation is totally falſe.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I exhorted all godly men to joyne themſelves to ſome viſible Church, if they have opportunity. <hi>I explained my ſelfe,</hi> I ſay to ſome viſible Church; not this or that, but ſome, I ſay, if they have opportunitie; for if God take away their opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61618:17"/>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, I</hi> exhorted all godly men, being joyned to ſome viſible Church, to ſtrive to walke in ſome neerneſſe of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with that Church: <hi>as,</hi> 1. In love; <hi>2.</hi> Peace; <hi>3.</hi> Watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; <hi>4.</hi> Chriſtian toleration of Infirmities; <hi>5.</hi> Seeking one anothers welfare; <hi>6.</hi> Defending one another from common enemies, <hi>Gen. 14. 14. Act. 7. 24. Act. 9. 24, 25. Where you may ſee a miſtake in the</hi> Relator <hi>of this laſt</hi> Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>this is the real truth, as I can produce mine own notes, and skores of</hi> Witneſſes <hi>to atreſt the ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, Obſerve that this relation which now is printed, was carried on the Sabbath day to another <hi>Chappell,</hi> a mile diſtant, and there written downe in all haſt, and the next morning poſted away to <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> and that week to <hi>Yorke:</hi> ſpread fifty miles diſtant in a few dayes: the next weeke I hearing of it, both from <hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>Manche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> I took occaſion to ſpeake with Mr. <hi>Hollingworth</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, who ſaid he had ſeene ſuch a <hi>Letter,</hi> and I related unto him mine own Expreſſions, and ſenſe, who ſaid af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he heard me, that I had a deale of wrong done unto me; I deſired to know the party that did write the <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> that I might vindicate my ſelfe; but he deſired to be forborne in that; I intreated him then to doe mee that <hi>Brotherly Office,</hi> as to deale with the party himſelfe; who promiſed he would, yet after all this, the Letter is ſent to <hi>London,</hi> and printed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The next <hi>Lords day</hi> after I heard of this, I publickly before all the Congregation, related what I had heard was written to <hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> (the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being preſent) I then deſired to repeate what I had
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61618:17"/>
delivered, and did ſo; and ſhewed before all, my ſenſe, that I meant it of the Common enemy of the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> (we being at that time imbroyled in Civill warre,) and I added, <hi>That I was ſo farre from judging it lawfull, for the Congregationall men to take up Armes againſt the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, that I held it unlawfull for any private man to take up Armes, except he was backed by Publick Authoritie. Yea, I thought this warre, now in being, could not be juſtified, but that it hath the Authoritie of the State to mannage it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, diverſe weekes after this, (learning who was the <hi>Writer</hi> of this <hi>Letter)</hi> I dealt with him about it before one of his intimate friends, <hi>Paul Greenwood,</hi> ſhewing him how unchriſtianly he had dealt with mee in it: <hi>Paul</hi> anſwered, indeed he ſhould have knowne my ſenſe before he had divulged it: and for his part, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the paſſages of that Sermon as diligently as he could, and did not finde any thing of juſt exception a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it: and I judge this <hi>Paul,</hi> as judicious a Chriſtian as moſt about us, yet all this would <hi>not cauſe the Letter</hi> to be recalled, or <hi>ſtayed from Printing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, It may clearely be diſcerned by this <hi>Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and the <hi>Circumſtances</hi> here ſet downe, that divers ſinnes, divers wayes have been committed. Firſt, by the firſt <hi>Relator,</hi> who upon the <hi>Lords day</hi> leaving his owne <hi>Chappell,</hi> in the midſt of the day, to goe to carry a piece of a <hi>Relation,</hi> which proves the ſeed of <hi>ſlander;</hi> if <hi>witting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> he minced the <hi>relation</hi> in the limitation, there's <hi>Doegs</hi> ſinne in it, yea if he related it in that ſenſe which the <hi>Scribe,</hi> and Publiſher in Print ſeeme to import, (as it is very probable, by his <hi>haſty</hi> telling of it, and the others <hi>haſty</hi> writing of it abroad) it was in that ſenſe then the like ſinne, to their's that were the falſe witneſſes againſt our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 60, 61. <hi>cum Joh.</hi> 2. 19. 21. But if it
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61618:18"/>
was <hi>raſhly</hi> done, without any ſiniſter intention, (which is much to be doubted,) yet there was evill in it, to relate a Paſſage, and to leave out principall circumſtances for the underſtanding of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Sinnes committed by the Writer, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulger were.</p>
            <p>Firſt, A <hi>receiving an accuſation againſt an Elder upon one witneſſe,</hi> without enquiring of the Elder, whether it were ſo, though he might have done any day, and then divulging of it, behinde the backe, and never to the face, in a ſlanderous manner.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Impenitency, and hardneſſe of heart,</hi> for when he was ſhewed his ſinne, and could not but ſee it, yet to this day, he <hi>never</hi> gave <hi>any ſatisfaction,</hi> or teſtimony of repentance to the party wronged; neither did he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the divulging and printing of it, which he might eaſily have done, had he timely improved his endeavours, which in godlineſſe he ought to have done; but it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in this particular act, <hi>he loved evill more then good,</hi> and ſlandering more then ſpeaking righteouſneſſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52. 3.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The ſinne of him that publiſhed in print theſe things was, his printing ſlanderous Relations upon ſo ſleight Grounds, without enquiring into the certain truth; yea having been admoniſhed before of ſuch dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings by Mr. <hi>Burroughs,</hi> Mr. <hi>Saltmarſh;</hi> and Mr. <hi>John Goodwin,</hi> and found faulty in the ſame kinde, and yet goes on in the ſame trade; ſurely the Wiſe man layes a heavy doome on ſuch, <hi>Pro.</hi> 29. 1.</p>
            <p>All this ſhews by wofull experience, that there is a ſpirit of malice workes in the hearts of Brethren againſt ſome of their Brethren more virulent in this kinde, then the Spirit of Epiſcopacy, ſtriking not only at our peace,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61618:18"/>
libertie, and livelihood, but at our good names and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations unjuſtly: which the Biſhops never could ſo touch: But I hope, God will in his time cleare us; as in this particular by his goodneſſe he hath done, and all the world may ſee it, if they will but view this.</p>
            <p>Brethren, thus I have given you the truth, which I will avow; if you pleaſe to adde any thing within theſe bounds which is defective; to blot out any thing redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant or unneceſſary, or alter any phraſes which are harſh or unpoliſhed, I give you free libertie, nay I intreate you as Brethren to doe it, and inſert it with your owne, and I will acknowledge my ſelfe much obliged unto you. I ſalute you both in the Lord, and deſire to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred to all the Brethren, and ſo remaine</p>
