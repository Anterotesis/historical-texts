            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THIS place, being by the discretion of a Royal <hi>Umpire</hi> appointed for the <hi>Rendezvous</hi> of the approaching Parliament; is at present look'd on as a <hi>Metropolis,</hi> from whence that cried up Commodity of <hi>News</hi> is only to be had at the <hi>first hand</hi> and dispersed by <hi>retail</hi> to all remoter places.</p>
            <p>Supposing it therefore probable that any <hi>New Coin</hi> report from hence may not only gain <hi>acceptance</hi> from its <hi>stamp</hi> of Novelty, but <hi>credit</hi> from the reputation of its <hi>Mint:</hi> I am willing so far to satisfie your curiosity, as to set my weak abilities on the <hi>rack</hi> to <hi>extort</hi> some languishing description of our thoughts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures on the intricacies of the present juncture of affairs.</p>
            <p>We are sensible that His Majesties late putting a <hi>Dissolution</hi> to a <hi>Resolving</hi> Parliament, and giving their great pretensions to discovery, a <hi>Nonplus,</hi> (by a previous Prorogation even at that very time when their prophetic fears were contriving a longer Session) did strangely disquiet those <hi>of the like occupation,</hi> who had been told by popular Abettors that by <hi>their crafts</hi> they should get no <hi>small gain;</hi> and at the same time so <hi>full of wrath</hi> that they would possibly have <hi>filled</hi> not only the <hi>whole City,</hi> but the <hi>Realm</hi> with <hi>confusion,</hi> had no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> His Majesties most admirable Wisdom diverted their thoughts by wholy busying them in fresh canvasing for new Representations. This politic <hi>Whetstone</hi> turn'd the edge of their fury, and it did somewhat abate the sorrow for their late <hi>demolished goddess,</hi> to think it was in their power to <hi>erect</hi> a <hi>new one,</hi> and for the quicker expedition (as well as from a sence of gratitude for past services) they resolve it shall be out of the same <hi>materials</hi> and <hi>chief Corner stones</hi> which were <hi>plucked</hi> from the <hi>former.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We confess to have no such <hi>vulgar</hi> thoughts as to give our approbation of the <hi>common</hi> humour herein; since we suppose it was as much against the <hi>Interest</hi> as <hi>Honour</hi> of Elective Societies, which being the Trading part of the Nation are much concern'd
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:107125:3"/>
in the maintenance of undisturb'd Traffique, but this being upheld chiefly by peace and satisfaction at home, must needs be dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by employing the disturbers of our setled Tranquility: Again some of them were particularly concerned not to <hi>disoblige</hi> so good a <hi>Customer</hi> as His Majesty, who, they knew no doubt, desired to see <hi>new faces</hi> when he dismissed the Old ones. If they neglected Interest they might have consulted Honour, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered what a shame it would be, that Counties and Corporations should be judg'd so barren of honest Gentlemen that the same only should be thought capable of undertaking so great a trust; but alas they were so far <hi>biass'd</hi> with prejudice, that they neither <hi>lean'd</hi> to the sober consideration of Profit or Fame; nay these two inconsiderate Remora's put so little a stop to their Zeal, as they rather promoted their violence; they were told perhaps that <hi>Lex Talionis</hi> was a Limb of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and thought it therefore a piece of priviledge in the <hi>Subject</hi> to quit scores with their <hi>Soveraign,</hi> and since he had so oft denied their <hi>humble Petitions</hi> it were but reason for them to thwart his <hi>desires;</hi> And as to the last<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they were loath to take <hi>New Adventurers</hi> in the <hi>good old cause,</hi> supposing experienced Soldiers could best shoot at the same Mark. How zealous their intentions, how resolute and how effectual their endeavours have been to reduce the old dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>located <hi>Members</hi> to a reunited <hi>body,</hi> the consequence best shews. For our experience best tells us the <hi>Plastick vertue</hi> which was inherent in the Commonalty would <hi>operate</hi> on no other <hi>matter</hi> but the same, as only capable of introducing the <hi>same form;</hi> so that our dull <hi>Aristotle</hi> is now to be baffled, while such Machins of nature can do more than nature her self, <hi>a privatione ad habitum dare regressum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus did the factious Metropolis lead the Van, and set a noble Example for the rest to follow; they first argue the case in <hi>Dialogues</hi> and <hi>Advices to Electors.</hi> Wherein they plainly shew there was no way left of extirpating Popery, accommodating differences, securing Liberty, and preventing Arbitrary power, but by employing those they had already experienced to be such stout Champions in so commendable a quarrel; and therefore, well supposing they could not be more <hi>to the life represented,</hi> when the time of Election comes and the same Gentlemen Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to serve them, the unanimous Voters (without the tedious ceremony of poling) <hi>lift up their hands on high,</hi> and extoll the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:107125:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
name of all those their heated affections were so intent upon. The Lord Mayor, it is true, was so grand a Patriot of their cause and zealous a promoter and defender of their <hi>right of Petitioning,</hi> that it is more than probable they would not in civillity have denied him the Honour, if he would have vouchsaf'd his accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; but his <hi>modesty</hi> or <hi>policy</hi> declares himself no ways ambitious of it.; and so gives leave that the <hi>Compositum</hi> may result out of the same <hi>quaternion</hi> of <hi>Elements</hi> it consisted of before.</p>
            <p>And thus, <hi>Urbis ad exemplum totus componitur orbis.</hi> For as far as our intelligence reaches, we do not hear but that the same Persons have carried it in most Elections, to the great Charges and disappointment of all their Competitors. Particularly this City (which Ass like does always kick against that indulgent dam which lets her suck from her so plentiful a livelyhood) does so industriously (I mean <hi>ex industriâ</hi>) oppose whoever in such cases the University recommends to them, that scorning in their own Rhetorick to have it said, <hi>the University should choose them a Parliament Man,</hi> they have refus'd a neer Neighbour and Loyal Gentleman, for being too much a Scholar, and pick'd out the two former <hi>Cocks of the game,</hi> (though they both rise from the <hi>dunghill</hi>) to fight out the <hi>prize</hi> they are so deeply engaged for.</p>
            <p>It would have been unmannerly indeed for the Citizens not to hearken to their noble Chancellour, who not only interceded by friends, but appear'd himself in Person (though for the same thing he formerly received a just check from His Majesty) to promote the interest and encrease the partie of his two friends. To this end <hi>His Grace</hi> upon timely notice arrives here to exert the Priviledge of his <hi>freedom,</hi> and let the World know he had a <hi>City</hi> as well as a <hi>House</hi> Vote: And though he was so violently engaged against the Court partie, he turns Courtier in flattering the People, and in the sensless noise of the Tumultuous croud he waves his <hi>Tongue</hi> and <hi>Hat</hi> in crying up a <hi>Whorwood</hi> a <hi>Whorwood;</hi> in this manner for all his pretended hatred to Popery he walks in <hi>procession</hi> through the streets, and scrapes, cringes, and complements to all the <hi>Cloak'd fraternitie,</hi> though (if I am not misinform'd) his own Porter once took the chief of them but for <hi>Fidlers.</hi> As he was his friends chief Advocate he thinks it his duty to become Oratour, therefore in two or three short and sweet oratiuncles (each of which might have been Printed by <hi>F. S.</hi> for a <hi>Speech of</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:107125:4"/>
               <hi>a Noble Peer of the Realm</hi>) he exhorts them to make the fame worthy choise, and not hearken to the clamorous suggestions of Popishly affected Scholars, and he plaies his part so well that the whole rabble <hi>Whistle</hi> after the <hi>same tune,</hi> and to our Loyal objections of <hi>No Fanaticks, No Latitudinarians,</hi> they give the thundring replie of <hi>No Pope, No Clergie;</hi> nay one of the most factious Mechanicks hearing a Graduate exclaiming <hi>No Round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, No Round-head,</hi> scraping his wit out of a Cap, gave the ingenious repartee of <hi>No Square-head, No Square-head.</hi> Thus were we poor Scholars miserably baffled in all our pretences to Arts and Sciences: We must trot back to the Grammar-School to know how to decline <hi>Variabile vulgus,</hi> and to learn in what case to put that fleeting <hi>Polyptoton,</hi> (though the witty Rogues confess when we and their Wives like <hi>two Substantives meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> we have the skill to put our selves in the <hi>Genitive</hi>) Then in the very first rudiments of Logick we are vastly to seek, since we must now from their <hi>undivided</hi> engagement in the same faction take the word <hi>Rabble,</hi> though <hi>praedicatur de multis</hi> to be an <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduum vagum.</hi> And our skill in Rhetorick is quite exploded, no plausible arguments are found effectual to move the resolute Multitude, which being tied to the <hi>mast</hi> of prejudice put a <hi>Waxen-eard</hi> deafness to all our <hi>Syrenical</hi> perswasions, but here's our comfort, experience never found their Consorts so inexorable. Yet at least though the Scholars (in more than one sense) their benefactours, could scarce recover a good <hi>Vote</hi> (i. e. <hi>wish</hi>) in recompence, yet sure they might consider what honour to the place and profit to the Inhabitants, is likely to accrue from His Majesties appointing so numerous a convening here, and from hence should result some spark of gratitude to induce them in some particular manner to express their thanks in return for so great a favour; but how contrary herein the torrent of their actions hath run to their duty, any one knows, who does but consider, that His Majesty in the last Parliament was pleased ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly to intimate his dislike of one of their re-chosen Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, though thinking him somewhat below his notice, he did it in a facetious Nick-name:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>He being one—Who by hook or by crook,</l>
               <l>Were resolved to rout the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Duke.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:107125:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>Well but perhaps Sir, you will ask me why we seem angry with our City, for taking in a like case the same priviledge with the University; who have so unanimously returned to the succeeding Parliament those two Gentlemen who represented them in the last: The inequality of reasons would soon give you an answer; I shall only say that we are so far from suspecting dislike of our same choice, that we have reason to think had all the other <hi>Members</hi> been Persons of as great Loyalty, Prudence and Integrity, both King and Subject had been quitted of the trouble of recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting a new <hi>Body.</hi> It is true one of those worthy Persons had but small encouragement to reingage himself in our service, being formerly some time forc'd to be a <hi>Secluded Member,</hi> but I hope he will be more civilly entreated, when he is within the verge of his own Liberty.</p>
            <p>But Sir, if you enquire some fresher news, and desire my opinion whither the approaching Sessions are likely to be durable, or an happy accommodation feasible, I am (though <hi>Academicus Aulicus</hi>) such a Novice in Court policie and so unacquainted with State affairs, that I do not at least pretend to an ability of giving a satisfactory answer. All I can say is, we humbly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the honour done unto us by His Majesty in accepting of a <hi>Colledge</hi> for his <hi>Palace,</hi> and making a <hi>Court</hi> of our <hi>Academy.</hi> We therefore freely resign our <hi>Chambers</hi> to more Noble Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and wish there might be as much use of our <hi>Studies.</hi> We readily take His Majesties <hi>desires</hi> for <hi>Commands,</hi> and are prepared to withdraw to make room for better Company; and as many of us as are not like to have the happiness of being retained for His Majesties <hi>Security,</hi> will retire at a distance and pray for His <hi>Preservation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time we hope this place may so far sympathize with its noble Chancellours Deputyship, as to <hi>stifle</hi> all the <hi>vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous contagions</hi> of disaffected Spirits, to dissolve all the specious <hi>Cobwebs</hi> of disloyalty, by irritating the artifices of Wiredrawing <hi>Spinsters,</hi> and finally to correct all misapprehensions, and create a right understanding both <hi>of</hi> and <hi>between</hi> all parties; that so without any longer interruption, <hi>Plotters</hi> of all sorts may receive such a <hi>Doom</hi> as shall be a <hi>just recompence</hi> for all <hi>their labours;</hi> yet that the popular clamours for <hi>justice</hi> may not stop the due and regular course of it, but that all Opponents may acquiesce in the determination of their wise Moderator; and not proceed to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107125:5"/>
expose the weakness of their own cause by a too clamorous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, to invalidate the arguments and vilifie the Persons of their unhappy Adversaries. To this end we heartily wish there may be no grudges or animosities fomented, no suspicions or jealousies created, or revived; no biassing distractions to divert regular proceedings; and no new vampt contentions to engage us in old quarrels. We do not therefore so much despair of better success from the same Persons, as we hope an alteration of the place may effect some change in their proceedings, that they be not again so niggardly as to deny necessary supplies, so timorous as to pretend they will be misapplied, and so impudent as to avouch they <hi>want a</hi> KING <hi>whom they may trust;</hi> but that a sence of their Errors may so far extimulate them to their duty, as readily to comply with His Majesties just desires, for the more facile attainment of their own; whereby a happy harmony arising between King and People, all true Subjects may have reason to bless this our <hi>Sion</hi> for its pacifick property. If this be the happy event, we disposessed Gown-men may be soon reinstated in our old mansions, it being probable His Majesty may then adjourn the agreeing Company to their Old quarters. Nay if our hopes fail in this, our Successors may be forc'd more suddenly to resign, for if <hi>Sisyphus</hi> like they will <hi>roul up</hi> the same stone, they must expect to <hi>tumble down</hi> with it; And if they think their <hi>late Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents</hi> sufficient authority for the <hi>same proceedings,</hi> let them <hi>ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> out what intentions they will upon the <hi>Anvill</hi> of Resolves, His Majesty may distinguish between the <hi>Finis Operis &amp; Operantis,</hi> and give the <hi>Actors</hi> an <hi>Exit</hi> before the <hi>Play</hi> ended. As we heartily deprecate this effect, so we as sincerely abominate those courses which are probable to be the cause of it; for how much their harping on the same string (will not only untune themselves, but) does jar against our united sentiments will easily appear from taking a transitory prospect of our <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Loyalty.</hi>

            <p>Neither does our education to <hi>science</hi> induce us to scorn, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn, or turn into ridicule so sacred a Name as <hi>Conscience,</hi> which strikes us <hi>surdo verbere,</hi> not in such a sense as if we were deaf to all its impulses, or Adder<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>like remained unmov'd, charm it never so wisely: No, we honour it as implanted by God for a sincere Register of our actions, an impartial Censor of our affections, and a happy Moderator of our passions; and therefore we willingly hearken to its suggestions when it would Bridle and restrain our inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to sin.

            <p>A small burden hurts a gall'd horses back, so the most light and innocent impositions which come from superiours rub and grate against their squeasie consciences, and if they are denied the liberty of dissenting, they will take the license of revolting; and when once they will become <hi>Subject</hi> no longer for <hi>conscience sake,</hi> they zealously invade, Persecute, and Murder, their restraining Governours, and think in their conscience they do God service. We pitty their mistakes, but despair to rectifie them, since they are not come to the first step of amendment (<hi>viz.</hi>) acknowledgment of a fault. Let them therefore continue in their obstinacy, we'll allow <hi>their weakness</hi> to be a just plea. Yet we cannot but reflect on their hypocrisie, for let such cautiously precise Zealots never so much pretend to a care of not offending that little Deity within them, it is easily to be perceived they are notorious dissemblers, for while a few of our innocent ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies cannot be made to glide through the fine sive of their conscience, the grosser and more heavy bullets of sin, as Pride, Lying, Whoredom, and the like do with ease break their way through; thus their all powerful conscience is of no greater force then a Spiders fowling Net, wherein the larger and more fluttering insects do soon bustle through, while the weaker Fly is denied a passage out. When conscience serves thus for a pretext to disloyalty by wavering in doubts only to remain stedfast in self-opinion, we look upon her as a peevish ill-natur'd slut, that should not by <hi>Toleration</hi> have her silly humour in all things, but be severely dealt with, till her modesty teach her better manners then sullenly to contradict her superiours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. The sad effects of which cross grain'd moroseness in

            <p>
               <hi>Our</hi> conscience being otherwise instructed, teaches <hi>us</hi> better things which are some other Branches of our Religion. We honour <hi>Episcopacy</hi> as a sacred Office of the most Primitive insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and think <hi>Parity</hi> as great a Solecisme in Church, as State. And we not only acknowledge a due respect to the function in general, but highly commend that order of it which the Wisdom of our Ancestors has settled in this Nation, and therefore think their envy blameworthy who cannot allow them their due right of profit, or honour; but would first degrade them from Peerage, and then crumble their revenues into many subdivisions. As we do not think this excellent Church Government could otherwise be kept inviolate from the rapine of Birds of prey, unless sheltred under the wings of <hi>Monarchy;</hi> so we hope our <hi>Princes</hi> will think their Autocrasie in prerogative (though not meerly inconsistent, yet) very unstable except supported with the wise upholding Columns of <hi>Episcopacy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We esteem of the Liturgy as an exact manual of Devotion, to all well pen'd Petitions whereof our conscience can safely say <hi>Amen;</hi> and pitty the blind arrogance of those who rely so much on their parts, as to scorn to take a ready drest oration to accost Omnipotency with, but transported with the Spirit of nonsence, tautology, and impertinency, unmannerly disgorge what their hasty digestion throws uppermost, to the nauseous disgust of all modest hearers.</p>
            <p>We pay a respect and obedience (not a veneration) to legal ceremonies without calling into question the authority of the imposer, and therefore are neither so ashamed of a crucified Saviour, as to refuse the wearing his badge in Baptisme; nor so averse to decency as to abhor the use of an outward sign of purity, or think the Surplais a superstitious upper Garment that first came out of the vestiary of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Harlot, or the wardrobe of the Babylonish Whore.</p>
            <p>In points of Worship we acquit our selves true Members of the <hi>British Church:</hi>

            <p>Thus we despise the pageantry of Crucifixes, the foolery of beads, and the drollery of an unknown Tongue in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of <hi>Divine service,</hi> yet we think there may be some fit helps to agitate and stir up a drouzy Devotion, therefore we scorn those <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>In like manner we laugh at the name of <hi>Pope</hi> yet retain that of <hi>Priest.</hi> We would <hi>kneel,</hi> yet not <hi>Worship</hi> the creatures in the Sacrament.

            <p>I should not give you a farther trouble of perusing such an ill drest account of our Faith, unless I knew that some would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, A principal Article of it is omitted, as long as no Mention is made how we stand affected to the belief of the late <hi>Popish-Plot.</hi> In declaring our sentiments wherein, I think will be offered a fit occasion of vindicating our selves from the imputation of <hi>Popery,</hi> whiech has been of late so confidently, eagerly, and maliciously laid to our Charge; And though perhaps barely to plead Not Guilty, would be as insufficient to the proof of our innocency, as the like vote in the case of another, which being asserted <hi>upon Honour,</hi> was reported to be meant with the Equivocation of <hi>Guilty upon Conscience.</hi> Yet because silence might gain the consent of many misinformed Persons, I shall recite those frivolous Reasons which huddled together helps to compose this bulk of accumulative Treason which we stand indited for.</p>
            <p>First, because we were so ingrateful to the preserver of our Lives and Liberties, Mr. <hi>Oats,</hi> as to deny him the privilege of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:107125:8"/>
Legal commencement to a degree the Title of which he did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready enjoy.</p>
            <p>Secondly, because our Representatives (which are supposed as not fitting in a personal capacity to follow the inclinations of those they represent) have not been such vigorous and zealous prosecutors of the late engaged Conspiracy, as so hazardous a case, <hi>pro aris &amp; focis,</hi> the preservation of His Majesty and security of the Protestant Religion did require.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that we espouse too much the interest of the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> in having too great a respect for his Person, too favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable an opinion of his Religion, and too fervent a desire of his Succession, all which we apparently show by a civil Drinking his Health in all Companies and Occasions.</p>
            <p>Then Fourthly, because a continued report has made it now unquestionable that the Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> in General are more then faintly addicted to <hi>Popery,</hi> the seeds whereof they certainly suck'd in this place wherein the moiety at least did first take their Education.</p>
            <p>I foresee that a clear and genuine answer to these clamorous Objections, would be so little effectual for the wiping away such malevolent aspersions, as it would but excite the obloquies of the vulgar to cast more dirt upon our reputation; since we should in a limited sence acknowledge the <hi>premises,</hi> and yet without sorfeiting our skill in Logic positively deny the <hi>conclusion,</hi> which our popular adversaries collect, <hi>viz.</hi> our <hi>well affectedness to Popery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall not descend to particulars, but dare say thus much for our vindication.</p>
            <p>We are as averse to the supremacy of a <hi>Pope,</hi> as we are firmly devoted to that of a <hi>King.</hi> We are as loath to become <hi>Cloistered Friars,</hi> as we are asham'd to turn wandring <hi>Tub-preachers.</hi> We think a <hi>Monks coule</hi> as ridiculous as a Brothers Cloak; and are satisfied that <hi>Fraying to the flesh</hi> is as impertinent as <hi>prating by the Spirit.</hi> We are somewhat unwilling to be so far impos'd upon as to swallow the distinction of <hi>the Church</hi> and <hi>Court of Rome,</hi> yet we know <hi>Jesuits</hi> have laid down more pernicious principles then many sober <hi>Catholics</hi> will consent unto; we are certain their <hi>Policy</hi> is greater than their <hi>Religion;</hi> and observe they never <hi>lift up their voice</hi> to convert Heretics but with the <hi>Trumpet</hi> of Sedition, nor <hi>cry aloud</hi> but with the Thundring of Canon: we see their

               </gap> they are satisfied that the most effectual way to compass their designs, is to remove their great obstacle the setled hierarchy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> whose vigilant Shepheards being once drawn off, or made incapable to defend their worried Flocks, they can soon by a poisoned sop, a threatning stick, or any other frivolous way put to silence those barking Curs, those Caterwawling Sectaries that now as saucily, as falsely, pretend it is their vigilance only that averts and prevents the invasion of the Enemy. They know Protestants to be like a bundle of well-packt sticks, not to be broke by the sinews of the strongest Arm while their ligament holds firm, but so brittle as to be snapp'd asunder with little force when unbound, separate, and disunited. It has therefore been all along their most politic design, and back'd with admirable success, first to crumble us into different opinions, then to make each <hi>fancie</hi> espouse a <hi>party,</hi> and so set

them all a scrambling for trifles, till rightdown blows must decide the difference; while they remain houting Spectators, promoting the quarrel, till they themselves get the prize the hot-headed combatants were so eagerly engaged for. The truth of this is most excellently demonstrated by <hi>Philanax Anglicus;</hi> and has the concurrent Testimony of one of the <hi>greatest witnesses</hi> of this Age; though we have reason to think he did not cordially design that advantage, the Governours of our Church may occasionally take in reference to the providing for their own security, because he would not accept of <hi>L'Strange</hi>'s farther discovery of the same design, though dedicated to him with many civil Complements, in better language than was returned for them at the Council Board.</p>
            <p>I hope from what is said you will easily collect our Belief of the reality of a <hi>Popish Plot,</hi> and our disaffection to any other Religion than our own; If the rabble will yet prosecute us with the loud acclamations of <hi>Papists, Jesuits,</hi> or <hi>Dog-Towzer,</hi> we know not what better to say in our own behalf, than what a sore-cited Gentleman in the like case avouches for his innocency, we are true Sons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> were never at Mass and Finally believe as much of the <hi>Plot</hi> as Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> himself.</p>

We think the Name of <hi>Prince</hi> as Sacred as that of <hi>Priest;</hi> and are certain no weapon ought to be formed against him: while we look upon the sly <hi>Jesuit</hi> and barge sainted <hi>Fanatick</hi> as two dangerous <hi>Philistine Foxes,</hi> that carry between their <hi>tails</hi> that <hi>brand</hi> of confusion, <hi>The lawful deposition of supreme Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates.</hi> We hold likewise that the asserting the due <hi>Regalia</hi> of a Prince is not only the province of a <hi>Politician,</hi> but many times becomes the task of a <hi>Divine,</hi> whose indispensable duty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring him to instruct the People in the performance of all Christian duties, he would neglect pressing home one of the greatest, if he should not sometimes insist upon that firm obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation which is laid upon all men, of being subject to the higher powers: we much question therefore their true intentions who would confine the subject of a Sermon to Grace, Faith, spiritual illuminations, beatifick visions and other transporting Topicks, while they censure as Eccentrical and impertinent all Pulpit discourses of subjection, obedience, and non-resistance.</p>
            <p>Again, we suppose that Kings Prerogatives ought not to be encroached on by a pretence of preserving the Peoples liberty: and believe Subjects have no privilege to question their Soveraigns authority<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We think it a great solecisme in good manners for People to challenge a <hi>coordinate</hi> power with him who is set over them, and therefore must be above them all.

they have since encreased by the permission of Princes, we are sure their power at utmost extends no farther, then barely to propound and advise unto; while it is the Kings unquestioned right to refuse, or ratifie their Motions. We imagin therefore that for bare <hi>Votes</hi> to be accounted as <hi>Acts,</hi> is as great an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment on nonsence, as for a <hi>House of Commons</hi> to challenge the Name of <hi>Parliament:</hi> we think the first a miserable <hi>Catachresis,</hi> and know the last to be an insufferable <hi>Synechdoche.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We judge it convenient that private Persons should not be such intermedlers in public affairs, as to notifie to Princes their errors in Government, and supplicate for a redress of grievances when there is no appearance of any but in the imaginary draughts of their own timorous fancies: when Subjects surpass the limits of modesty in such extravagant addresses, it is but Wisdom in Princes to disencourage their attempts, since the granting of some things would but give a fresh provocation to endless de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. Petitioners being like dropsical fish-natur'd sippers, who by constant bibbing Metamorphose their stomacks into lime-pits, where moisture produces so contrary an effect, that the more they drink the more they burn.</p>
            <p>We look upon the Oath of Allegiance as made not only to bind <hi>Papists,</hi> but <hi>Protestants</hi> to obedience.</p>
            <p>We hold it nonsense that <hi>Major singulis,</hi> should be said to be <hi>Minor universis,</hi> at the same time a Soveraign, and yet a Subject of all his Subjects: And we think it as miserable a fallacy to divide the Prince into a <hi>Personal</hi> and <hi>Politic</hi> capacity, and so usher in a pretence of fighting for the King, when the Sword is drawn against him. Ours being no Elective Monarchy, we look upon the Crown as an inheritance entailed upon the lawful Heir, of which he ought not to be dispossessed by Persons that have no authority to take away the privilege os his Birth-right: And to this we farther add, it is somewhat disingenuous for People forcibly to divert all natural affection, and compel a Prince to sacrifice to the humour of the vulgar, one of the nearest of his own Bloud. We had rather other methods of securing the Protestant Religion, so freely offered by His Majesty might be accepted of; and when all courses are taken which can lawfully be used, the event must be left to God alone, whose Providence determins the success of all intentions.</p>

               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:107125:10"/>Sir, the design at first proposed of giving this cursory essay of our <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Loyalty,</hi> was to intimate how the proceedings of the late Parliament, in many things were very far from obtaining of our approbation, how extravagantly soever magnified and extolled by the applauding vulgar.</p>
            <p>For first, they run contrary to our sentiments in Religion.</p>
            <p>Did they not use all the Spades and Mattocks of Seditious contrivances to undermine the Foundation of our well establisht Church-Government? Did they not envy us the support of our chief Pillars, the Bishops, whom they would first have made weaker and then pulled down? Would they not have let in many beasts of the Forrest to our Vineyard, by making a breach in our fence, in taking out three stakes from our hedge of the 39 Articles? Would they not have given encouragement to divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by granting liberty to dissent, and by removing of penalties, have invited many to transgress? Did they not take up at the second hand many old artifices of innovating a change; as crying out against the unreasonableness of <hi>Pluralities,</hi> the inconvenience of <hi>Non-residence,</hi> and affirming the necessity of a redress of both? And finally did they not use all methods of irritating the vulgar to vilify the Clergy, because they were the chief opposers of Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and perswaders to Allegiance and uniformity.</p>
            <p>Then in opposition to <hi>Loyalty,.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How arbitrary and magisterial were their own proceedings, while they pretended to be doing nothing else but preventing the Arbitrary power of another? How many Honest and Loyal Gentlemen did they force to do the penance of falling down and worshipping them for speaking blasphemy against their authority, while Treason against a higher power past unquestioned? How crosly and resolutely did they always deny His Majesties just demands, though they were to be employed for the Nations security? And at last how saucily would they have cried down the King by debarring him of the privilege of the meanest Subject, making it unlawful for any one to turn his Creditor though on never so good security? This is not the moiety of what might be said, but perhaps in this case:</p>

               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:107125:11"/>I hope all former miscarriages may be obliterated in the ashes of oblivion and rak't up in the embers of an ardent and mutual affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion between the King and his two Houses. I wish the same Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men may be sensible of their errors, and so become <hi>Achillean</hi> Physicians to cure the wounds which they themselves have made in our Church and state. Then will there be some encouragement for us Academics to make a diligent progress in our Studies, while there remain rewards suitable to our labours. But if preferments must be taken away, if Benefices must be monopoliz'd, and an equal maintenance allowed to the industrious and sluggish, it will invite us to take up some more advantagious employment. This puts me in mind of a passage in a late vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Clergy, intimating, that if Church-men were turned out of their livelyhoods, they would rather than starve, adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to turn Soldiers to recover them. That is rather then the <hi>tribe of Levi</hi> would be <hi>couchant,</hi> as <hi>Issachar</hi> under the <hi>burden</hi> of poverty, they would become so many <hi>Judah</hi>'s, Sword-bearers to avenge themselves of their enemies. I may add, if ever the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions of the rabble reduce them to this extremity (which God avert) we who are the <hi>Sons of the Prophets,</hi> and bred in their <hi>Schools</hi> should <hi>gather to our Fathers,</hi> and be intituled to the Church <hi>mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,</hi> and dying Martyrs in so good a cause, should be in hopes of being transplanted to the <hi>triumphant.</hi>
